1,Shattered truths,"Richard finally admits that he is gay after lying to his fans and to himself for so long. That is one honest and courageous act that made me laughing out loud. Don't ever take his revelation as an example of a strong human being. Take it as a example of a weak human character.If you really want to learn what honesty and courage are, and how to be true to yourself and to others, please read Damages by Bazhe. This is a book that would change your live and make you strong, confident, and proud of yourself as an human being."
4,As if You're There,I am currently enjoying reading this book. Richard Chamberlain writes in great detail as to imagine you've seen the same places. The book is amusing and easy to read. I have been a fan of Mr. Chamberlain's since Dr. Kildare but didn't know much about his personal life. This has been very interesting. It's also fun to read about other celebraties mentioned in this book. I would highly recommend this book to all his fans.
3,Unexpected,"Don't pick up this book if you're looking for a gossip-fest. It was an interesting read, but certainly not what I expected when I picked up a celebrity biography. It's more an inspiration/philosophy book as Mr. Chamberlain details his own pyschological deconstruction and the construction and growth of his personal spiritual philosophy. Yes, it's got some great stories about behind-the-scenes Hollywood and the celebrities he worked with on the way. The Shogun experience was especially interesting. He's also well-traveled and those stories are as interesting as the ""Hollywood"" ones. The whole book is written in a gentle, thoughtful voice, and even though it wasn't what I expected, I find myself thinking that I may have just met a ""gentle and thoughtful"" person through its pages."
2,Shattered Hopes,"I anxiously awaited this book. Coming-out novels are usually poignant memoirs of the trials associated with living in the closet. How disappointed I was to find very little about R.C.'s experiences in Hollywood. Rather than a tell-all story of one man's journey to freedom, Shattered Love is merely a vehicle for R.C. to repeatedly discuss his pantheistic beliefs. The book belongs more in the self-help section than in the biography area."
2,Got Milk?,"This is a disappointing book - no more than a meal of white milk and white bread. In the later chapters, Chamberlain muses that ""ideally"" an actor's life would be completely unknown to his audience, and mentions that he had been uncertain whether to include Martin, his life companion, in the memoir at all. What might people think? As it happens, he reveals very little about himself and even less about Martin. His spiritual journey is also bland, flirting with New Age distortions of Hasidic belief.I think only the most diehard fan would not regret this purchase."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"This book was jammed with filler by Richard Chamberlain spouting all his philosophical ideas. He evidently did not lead much of a life as he told very little of it in this book.I tried to read his philosophies of life, but it was just too boring. I was able to skip over that dreck and read about his life, which just wasn't all that interesting. Too bad, I thought he would offer more."
2,"No ""stuff""...just ""fluff""","Richard Chamberlain's memoirs of his career and his spiritual awakening are all fine, but the book did not elaborate on the internal and external struggles that he (and all gay and lesbian people) experienced in dealing with accepting his homosexuality.It's hard to believe that he experienced heterosexual sex ONCE (while in Japan) and then met his only domestic partner approximately 20 years later...No sexual encounters other than these two experiences....???? I don't want details but I would have been able to identify with the book more had there been a more gay view than spiritualistic view presented in the book.I'm reading Billy Bean's book now (just started it today) and it expounds more of the internal and external conflicts of gays in the closet and their struggle for acceptance upon ""coming out."""
2,"Oh, come on...","I mean, is it NEWS that Richard Chamberlain has been gay all these years? Does anyone care? Not me. And that this book is getting so much hype is a shame when it does little more than skim the surface of his life and career. Chamberlain's writing is almost courtly as he tries to explain how he has `evolved as a spiritual being.'Sheesh, I'm over it."
5,"wonderful, warm, touching","It's hard too find proper words to describe the book and the feelings it had roused in me (especially because English is not my native language). So I just want to say: it's a terrific book. Warm and touching. If you are a fan of Richard Chamberlain - you should read it. If you want to know more about him - read it, too. I never have read such an open biography. He is opening his heart and his soul. I always knew Richard is a terrific actor but know I know he is also a terrific author. I just hope there will be more books from him. And I wish to say. Congratulations to Richard and Martin for such a wonderful longtime relationship - and thanks for this wonderful present to the fens. Aloha and Mahalo Nohea and Moani."
4,Much Effort and Thought,"I think some of the low reviews for this book are the result of certain expectations. Some were expecting a tell-all book with lotsa dirt on celebrities. I think also many were expecting a lot more on Richard's homosexuality, especially his romances.Instead, what one gets is a charming, well-written book with deep spiritual insights. Mr. Chamberlain is a man who is at peace with himself and his surroundings. He worked hard at his acting craft and caused no trouble on the set. He kept quiet and did his job. He comes off as a sweet, decent man with no vitriol to spill.If one wants dirt, check out the autobios of Eddie Fisher or Tony Curtis. Otherwise, one should accept this fine book for what it is."
3,"""Just be.""","In his memoir, Richard Chamberlain describes the early feelings of inadequacy and need for love that lead him into acting, his break-through role as ""Dr. Kildare"" and later success inShogunandThe Thorn Birds, but the book is mostly about his spiritual journey, especially his experience with transcendental meditation.Chamberlain comes across as an intellectual and well-spoken man; unfortunately, I found his endless discourses on meditation and the essence of Truth and Love confusing and repetitive. I was expecting more about his acting career. The book contains many professional and personal photos."
2,Lack of Taste,"I admit that I was interested in Richard's memoirs with respect to his personal endeavors and I must say that this book truly missed the point. The spiritual insights and hardships, as well as the professional goals of his life were overly detailed resulting in an uninteresting book. Anticipation of another book, with more of an intimate appeal would be welcomed so that the reader can really feel his personality and believe that he also experienced living with more flavor."
5,A real page-turner,"This book broke my heart, because I learned things about my life-long heartthrob that I didn't know, and some things that I knew, but still had trouble with. He is truly the most gifted actor I have ever seen, on any screen, and is a terrific author as well. He has a sense of integrity and class you don't see much anymore."
1,Not worth it,"This book is less of an instructional book and more of an advertisement for the sold separately software. I'm glad I bought this book used and didn't pay much for it. I think even if I were willing to spend the money for the software, this book would still be unhelpful, because it has so little actual information and instructions. The few words of advice it does give makes me feel like anything I would create with this software would make the invitations just as original as the invitations kits would offer. Not worth the time to read it."
4,Good,"Interesting and informative, but I thought it would have had more ideas. Have not tried the software yet"
2,"OK, but you must buy other-sized tips you may not need","I could not find the tips I need in the store. Even the original manufacturer won't sell just one type of rubber tip. I needed the tip for spring door stops, but I had to buy 8 tips, 2 each of 4 different types just to get two of the type that I needed. Plus these are different from the originals. They are slightly smaller so I had to fight to get it on. I finally softened it by putting in hot water so it would stretch a little. I felt taken advantage of and ripped of, not being able to buy just what I want. It shows great disrespect for us customers."
2,They are all different sizes,"The picture posted (as of June 2011) and the description doesn't make it clear that what you are buying is an assorted package of different sized tips.There are 4 pairs of 2, so you won't be getting 8 of the same.The description should probably read ""assorted sizes""."
1,shipping of Spode,"I ordered this from Amazon on Dec. 12 because they told me it would arrive in time for Christmas.Today, Dec. 22, I received an email telling me it would not arrive until the end of January!If I had know this was the case I would have picked the dinnerware up in NYC when I was there on Saturday!!!!!I am very disappointed in the suppliers and notification system Amazon has in place!!!!It looks good in print but this is the second time one of Amazon's suppliers has NOT delivered!!!"
5,The laws of life,"I found the Laws of Thinking book amazing i followed some of the laws in the book and saw the truths things happened this is a book of life ,laws and prosperity."
5,Amazing!!,I read this book at borders years ago. I had lost the arthor name a while back so I couldn't find it to buy it until a few months ago when one of my friends was reading it. I love it. My world & thoughts has been forever changed by this book! I also purchased the laws of prosperity by this author too. Amazing read as well. I'm 24 creating the life I truly desire! I definitely recommend this to everyone! And the book came 3 days after I purchased it! Please get it. You will be internally & spiritually transformed :)
4,"Informative, expository, revealng...","This book immediately reveals, clarifies, and will provide serious reader's with empowerment and self-determination information referenced and confirmed in Biblical writings."
5,The Laws of Thinking,"My Journey To Spiritual RestorationThe Laws of Thinking by Bishop E. Bernard Jordan is an awesome master piece. This book is a must read for all people. Until we begin to understand the power that is within our minds and how to use our consciousness to create the substance of the things that we hope for we will continue to depend on an economy that can't take care of itself. I found this book so inspiring that it has caused me to create the substances that I was praying for without understanding that I had the blue print in the deep recessive of my spirit to draw those things out.Bishop Jordan I thank God for you because I am money, I am spirit, I am omniprosperity, I am awesome health, I am god and besides me there is no other. God continuously bless you and use you as a blessing to the world.My Journey to Spiritual Restoration"
5,The Master Keys,"The Law Of Thinking gives you the Master Keys to unlock your doors for living. Once you enter the doorways, they are rules, spiritual laws and guidelines you have to follow that leads you through the pathways which will take you through your goals and developmental stages of your journey.The Journey of Life which is purpose, fulfillment, fulfeelment and destiny; the ultimate destiny of finding your Truest God Self.Thank You Grand Master Prophet E. Bernard Jordan for sharing God's principles, the principles that are in you and in each one of us and for giving us the permission to honor ourselves while feeling guiltless, but DESERVED."
5,My dad hates it,"In my humble opinion, this is The Scissor Girls greatest effort. They capture the purest spirit of No Wave idealism, and manage to entertain at the same time! An innovative and highly-underrated album in the music world. Give it a twirl on your stereo."
3,not bad for what it is,Usually I dont waist time with no wave bands but I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. Its abrasive and it takes a couple of listens to figure out what the hell is going on. But thats no wave for you. Its like a jigsaw puzzle of sorts that needs to be solved to appreciate. I'll tell you one thing I enjoyed this a lot better than the Pop Group's debut and that wasn't even no wave.
5,Excellent way to wake up in the morning,The tea is an excellent blend that lends itself well drinking with and without milk. I've had other teas that were far too bitter to enjoy without either sugar or milk and on the flip side teas that were too weakly flavored to add anything to them.I keep a box in my office at work for when I need a hot drink - much better than the Lipton they provide for free!
5,Great tea!,I recently went to Ireland and Barry's Tea was offered in many hotels we visited. I was so happy to find it on Amazon when I came home. It has great flavor!
1,"alas, not reliable","Be very careful of Symantec. Their product packaging says it applies to a certain operating system, but in reality it doesn't and you can't get it upgraded to apply unless you buy ""another"" package, so why pay twice? Don't trust the Symantec packaging. I spent 5 hours on the phone tonight with: tech support, who then determined it was a customer support issue, and then, surprise, customer support sent me back to tech support, who then (are you as tired yet as I was) sent me to customer support, who gave me a phone number to call that, slightly over an hour later (I wanted to see how long it took), was answered, and who knows if they are gonna help me, I gotta send in a bunch of paperwork. How do I know why their software that says it works on this operating system doesn't work?"
3,Bob's Experience,"The product was shipped and received in good order. It seemed to have all of the parts needed for installation. Only problem was that it was shipped with an installation CD for Windows 98. I have Windows Vista. I tried to get the drivers on line but the site was not cooperative. I emailed for the drivers 2 days ago, but haven't received yet. Unable to get my computer to recognize the hardware."
2,Turner's speculations vs. Newman's explanations,"One of the assertions of this work, that Newman's conversion from the Church of England to the Church of Rome was not inevitable, is underwhelming. Well, yes, John Henry Newman could have chosen any or several of myriad other paths than the one he followed from Anglicanism to (Roman) Catholicism. But Professor Turner builds scant support for rejecting Newman's own rationale for his journey and instead proffers his own tendentious speculations. In ""First Things: the Journal of Religion and Public Life"" (""Newman's Liberal Problem,"" April 2003), Fr. Edward T. Oakes, S.J., shoots and autopsies some of Professor Turner's other flights of speculation. Better to read Newman's self-analyses (""Apologia Pro Vita Sua"" or ""An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine"") than Turner's flighty psychoanalysis."
5,Love It,Easy to assemble. Light and Easy to carry. Love my new guitar stand. Now I can show it off in style:-D
3,Rather mediocre.,"Sorry to go against the chorus of praise, but I'm only partially satisfied with this guitar stand.Firstly, it's designed to be quickly collapsible. That may be great for someone in a band that's constantly on the go, but if you just want something to stand your guitar in the living room it leaves a bit to be desired. The cradle comes out with a quarter turn and there's no way to lock it in, and if my guitar strap loops around it I'll pull it right out. It's also very light weight and easy to knock over, and the legs fold in too easily. The guitar neck is secured with a cheap looking plastic bar that doesn't look like it will last too long.The $13 price tag may seem like a good value, which is largely the reason I ordered it, but the day after I placed my order with Amazon I went to a local Guitar Center where they had stack of heavier duty chrome plated stands for $10. I really wish I had waited that extra day."
2,Not what I thought,Not what I thought it would be...It isn't anything you couldn't get from the Authors 3 books that he has publishedsave your money
1,Not what i expected,I was hoping it would have a plan to build a rabbit cage or two and it did not. It talked about the different types of rabbit cages and what they are made out of that and that is about that
1,Doesn't Work,The marking gauge does not work. The sliding portion is either wedged or glued in therfore it is useless. Bent the brass thumb pin trying to get it to move.
2,Beechwood Mortize/Marking Gauge,"The marking gauge seems to be well made. I had only had the chance of using it once so far, but disappointed in it's performance. It has a pin to do the marking instead of a blade. In the hardwood that I was using, could not get it to mark very true. I wanted to wonder. (It was probably my poor technique."
5,Scott Walker and Lou Reed rolled into one!,This guy is unbelievable! Glyn Styler deserves to be a huge star - one listen to his instant classic You Killed My Love and you realize what's wrong with today's pop singers. This is high drama!
3,Not much new here,"This is a nice book if you still need a collection of the basic popular Christmas stories & songs. It's put together nicely, but there wasn't much new or unique in the book, except a couple of poems. There were some nice illustrations, but the book wasn't worth it just for those. So if you are looking for something new, not just the same old Christmas stories, don't get this book. But if you want all those in one place this is a good choice. I also found it a bit hard to read for long periods since it's small, but very thick. Handling it & keeping it open to read was tiresome."
4,The Little Big Book of Christmas,It was exactly what I was looking for as a gift to a youngster for Christmas. It will make someone very happy.
3,Hard to find what you need,"This is the only F90 book I have. It contains the answers to all questions I have had about using Fortran, but I found that it takes so much time trying to locate them. I would have like it better, had there been better organisation, good indexing and cross referencing."
4,for maintenance programmers,"As someone who first learnt programming using Fortran, and then spent many years in uni writing Fortran code, I guess it is encouraging to see books still come out about it. But the bulk of this book could have be written 10 or even 15 years earlier. Fortran changes so glacially, for one thing. (Though global warming might one day change the meaning of this phrase.)Who wants or needs this book? Mostly someone assigned to maintain a large engineering or scientific code base in Fortran. Maintenance programming is necessary; someone has to do it. But if you have enough raw ability and interest in programming, try looking for a job that does not require this book."
4,"Simple, so far!",This is a simple Harvest Moon. I really enjoyed it at first. I think I may be missing a few things and that may be why it isn't interesting anymore.
2,Ehhh.,"I love Harvest Moon,I really do,but this game felt like a hit and a miss.It's beautiful. It really is,they put a lot of work into backgrounds and graphics,but it just doesn't have the gameplay to back it. It gets very repetitive very fast and even worse time moves very slowly also. You get to points where you basically wake up and go right back to sleep.It doesn't quite have the feel of other Harvest Moon games. It has more of an RPG style gameplay,except it's this RPG where you have no immediate goals. O_o If you really really want the game,try to get it for under $5,anything above that leaves a great big disappointment."
2,not really worth it,"I bought this used of course, expecting what usually happens similar to harvest moon. I love the graphics and that little buggy vehicle. *Spoiler* the fact that this life person can't start a family and just farm and mine, makes it extremely dull. You do interact with villagers and creatures, but that's about where I lose intrest in it."
2,this game is not as good as it looks,"this game was perfect for a farmer,or a person with a lot of time on their hands. it wasnt as good as i wanted it to be its perfect for people who like crops which is why it might not being a game it is very realistic which makes it boring if you really want it go ahead but its not as fun as you think it is"
5,One of the best overviews of any artist's life and work,"The oft-controversial, but more oft-brilliant Will McBride often gets lumped into the same category as Jock Sturges or Sally Mann. There's some casual linkage there, but McBride has his own distinct territory, and it's examined exuberantly in this gigantic compendium of just about everything he did that's worth looking at. It's far superior to the impossibly skimpy Taschen book ""My '60s"", and even goes so far as to include the complete set of pages for ""Zeig Mal!"" (Show Me!), although they are reproduced rather small, probably to avoid too much trouble with small-minded authorities. Anyone even remotely interested in photography or McBride's work in general should not miss this."
4,"Emotional, beautiful, high-quality photographic book.","A photographic, autobiographical work covering McBride's life up to the 1970s (""To be continued""). Excellent, high quality photographs of McBride's work, including some controversial items. Text in German and English, with emotionally sad overtone. This is a large, physically heavy, high quality book - but many photographs are printed as a spread across facing pages, causing the inevitable problem that the photos are marred by being broken across the binding in the middle.McBride's work is hard to come by, most of it having been published in magazines, and in books now out of print. This book provides an overview of the incredibly vast quantity of photographs taken by McBride over his life, and it creates a longing to own a much more comprehensive set of his photos, as photographic prints (or on CDROM?) without the binding breaking up the photos."
3,Nice but Photos are Old,"McBride did some great original work as presented here. However, it has been surpassed by artists like Mikhail Rusinov, ""Holy Nature"" (a book a purchased on Amazon) which depicts Russian Nudists of all ages and many other recent art photographers."
1,narcissism as engaged art,"It is sad to see how a fertile period (the 60s and 70s) ends up being represented by some of its worst features: woodenly articulated ideology, narcissism, pretension, complacency, self pity. It is of course interesting to see, with time, how silly and sometimes downright wrong some of the slogans of the period in fact were. This book helps us see that, and as such is a real document.But its manipulations are deeply objectionable: invoking, for instance, Freud and Reich to justify one's own personal predilections is almost perverse (the reality of a child's sexuality should have nothing to do with the exploitation of that sexuality).To my mind, the professionalism of the photos does not justify this book's apparent reputation."
5,Unexpected Brilliance,"This was an unexpectedly entertaining read. I got a stack of old Laymon books for my birthday, Flesh included. I thought by the synopsis that it sounded a little hokey, but it would probably be a half decent light horror read if nothing else.It turned out to be really engaging, well beyond what I thought it would be capable of. I hate to say I had never even heard of Laymon before this, but I'm certainly glad i got the pleasure of discovering him for myself. It was extremelywell-written, descriptive and entertaining. Pick it up, you won't be disappointed.If you're a fan of this - Come Out Tonight by Laymon is another good place to find some entertainment."
1,Horrible - absolutely horrible,"This thing is a very bad joke. Between the horny men trying to get young women (O-h-h Alison I love you so much, O-h-h-h Alison I missed you so much) to put out, the ""let's hide the evil snake down someone's back"" and the idea that a completely different species could get turned on by human females I don't think I EVER wanted a book to END as much as this one. BTW - it was published in 1987 - and it shows. The ending was about as exciting as watching paint dry.If this is the best Laymon can do he needs to consider driving truck."
1,Unreadable,"The sample of this book was unreadable on the ""Kindle for PC"". The font colors are too close together and the pages just appear to be black with nothing written on them. I am glad I tried the sample before shelling out $$$ for this."
3,Do you wear that while cleaning?,"This is the first book I have read by Richard Laymon. Initially, I thought the female characters were simply far too contrived male fantasies, then I remembered the title of the book and thought, ""I guess I shouldn't be surprised."" Don't get me wrong, though. It's not a sex book. It is pretty good American gothic monster story."
4,pretty good,"After reading, and loving, Darkness, Tell Us, I jumped on this book with high hopes. I have to say I was a bit disappointed. What I loved about DTU was that it was simply audacious. Guys non-stop ogling girls, mountain-climbing killer in thongs, etc. was what made this book so much fun. Flesh is more heavy-handed when it comes to gore and blood, and simply not as funny as DTU. Still, it reads like a B-movie material, and, if you are into this type of pulp, is worth a few hours of your time."
3,muhahahaha....,"Not a bad little book. Not his best by any stretch, but was interesting. As always it is a gory romp through pages lol...Think Invasion of the body snatchers on a more painful scale."
2,silly,"this is my first book by richard laymon and it was terrible. at first i thought..mmm... this could be good but then is all down hill.for me, what makes this book terrible is the characters. is this town consist of stupid people that makes stupid/ slly decisions and fall in love at first glance? i mean, how can a person just got out of a terrible experience of violence and gore... and a few hours thinking about a possible ""romantic situation"" with a complete stranger she/he met? then the next day their are kissing and caring for each other... mauybe even in love. it is just silly and childish.i give it a 2 stars because this author had good ideas for specific terrifying scenes that i liked but in the end of the book i was reading at a fast, very fast pace, to finish the story because it was terrible.i will try to read other books of this author because maybe i wasnt that lucky with this one.maybe this book works for young persons."
2,"Same name, different product?","I have used this body butter brand for years but the last 2 shipments I've got are different. And not in a good way. The taste has a distinct lingering fake fruit flavor. The consistency of the butter is much stiffer, less creamy. And the dye in them is hell on the sheets."
2,"Not very ""peachy"" body butter","I'm always looking for peach-scented products, and although this product doesn't have an obnoxious smell, like some do, it doesn't smell very peachy either. For that reason and the cost, I wouldn't buy it again."
4,Excellent listening,I purchased Volume 1 and 2 at the same time and in the short time I have had them I have listened to all selections at least once and some twice or more and my conclusion is that this is an excellet buy and addition to your music library. Selections in Vol 2 are less well known but all are excellent.
4,NOT a copy of HOLLYWOOD dolls!!!!!!!!!,"hello!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the hollywood dolls came out AFTER this one!!!!!!!!! this doll came out in like, 2003!!! the hollywood dolls just came out last year! in 2005!!!!!! so the hollywood dolls copied the clothes of this doll!!! not the other way around!!! i had this doll, and i had a lot of fun with it! but i did NOT get the hollywood dolls. i don't really care for the hollywood ones. but this doll is hard to find, so it would be easier just to get 2 of the hollywood ones. oh, and she comes with:2 shirts1 pair of pants1 DRESSa lot of accessories1 star comband some other stuff.some people think that the dress is a shirt and skirt, but it's a dress!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and i like it a lot! it's so cute! same with all the rest of the clothes!!thanks for reading my review!!!!Minna"
4,Once again,"They got lazy with the clothes, these are recycled for the Hollywood Assitant Cloe. If you bought this brat and the other Cloe you would have double of the same skirt shirt and shoes, but with a different skin color. Overall though she is pretty, but I don't really like her clothes."
5,Awesome doll.,Bratz are so awesome so if you're a Bratz collector just don't listen to those people who complain. They are just mad because they don't have any. This doll is so great. I asked for it for Christmas but I didn't get it because it ran out of stock so quick. Please get more I want one so bad. BRATZ RULE!!!!!!!!!!
1,Bratz turn kids into bratz!!!!!!!!!!!,"I don't know what they were thinking! Bratz are garbage. We don't need 4 year olds wearing hip huggers! I hate bratz! They're turning kids into clones of Britney Spears!! At least Barbie wears appropriate clothing. Geeez, they don't even have noses. Congratulations, NNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TheY're SSSSSSSOOOOOOOOO ugly!!! I hope they go out of business!!"
5,This toy is great!,Im Jessica and im 11. My mom got me this a few days ago and it was so much fun. The hair is so pretty and you can do a lot of stuff with it. I would recomend this toy for girls ages 7-12. Thanks for reading this!
4,"Folds up easily, nice mat for the price.","I like the ease of unrolling and re-rolling up this mat. The velcro straps keep it secure when rolled up, so it's easy to store. It offers a little cushion and seems to be durable. The color was a light green color and it works well as a yoga/pilates mat."
4,Good buy!,"It's the perfect mat for pilates. Thick enough to cushion the back. I'm 5'5"" and the mat is definitely long enough for me. The color green didn't look at all like what's shown in Amazon, but I can live with it. Low odor and it went away after a few days. Easy roll up and love the velcro straps!"
5,Pilates Mat,"Ordered wrong item...supposed to order yoga mat...have to return, but it seems to be an excellent product. Would not send back if it wasn't wrong item."
5,so soft,"I just recieved this and love it. Yoga mats are too thin and hurt my back. But the mats that are too thick work against the moves in my opinion. This one is perfect, especially when balancing in a V. Forgot name of move. :) Definatly recommend."
5,buy this,if you buy this you will love it. And you will be just like a mommy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,bi-fold ramp,This is a good ramp for those that are looking into spending a few bucks. It sure is good knowing the fact that you have a ramp after a long day of riding. Although the ramp can be somewhat heavy but is sure does the job of putting the ATV on the truck.
5,Tetra cichlid sticks fish food,"Excellent product. I have used it for years. My Cichlids love it, grow fast and healthy..breeders"
4,Worth the slow start,"ALthough it takes awhile to get into this book, it rewards the initial patience. 1929 spins a rich narrative about America in the jazz age, focused on the enigmatic Bix Beiderbecke but also creating sympathetic characters in the mob hangers on Helen and Henry Weiss."
3,Outdated,"So, this is a useful read if you've picked it up at the library, but not worth owning. I read it cover-to-cover and the main message I got out of it was ""first time parents always buy boxed curriculums, but real homeschoolers grow up and mix/match their own."" Not very comforting when you're going into the first year. It just gives you permission to change it up at the end of the year. I dunno, there were great quotes from real people, but I still felt like I was being talked down to."
3,"Good info but atheistic orientation leaves it far from ""complete""","The author provides an excellent overview of the secular aspects of getting started in homeschooling. However, aside from a few passing mentions by profiled families in the ""week in the life"" chapter, she completely ignores the spiritual aspects. For the vast majority of homeschooling families, faith plays a central role in their lives, regardless of specific religious affiliation. Because of this glaring omission, I would recommend this book only as a supplement to another one such as Mary Pride for Protestants or ""A Catholic Homeschool Treasury"" for Catholics.Updated to mention a similar book that does incorporate a generic acknowledgment of the importance of religion/spirituality in homeschooling without endorsing any particular faith. It's calledHomeschooling: Take A Deep Breath - You Can Do This!"
2,Not as good as I was hoping,"When I first thought about homeschooling, I only knew Linda Dobson's name. I was all excited to get her books. But I was later disappointed. Her books (including this one) lack ""meat"" and are way too vague. There's a lot of fluff and I didn't really find anything that was particularly helpful or informative. I suppose it's a good, VERY basic introduction. But that's about it. The main thing that I did not appreciate about the author is her heavy unschooling bias. Not everyone is into unschooling. To the new homeschooler, that can be a real turn-off."
5,Serenade,I became enchanted with Winifred Horan when I bought her debut CD. This is more of the same fabulous Celtic style modern music and extremely enjoyable. I highly rate it for their individual talent as well as the music they chose. I LOVE it!
2,not convinced,"It was fascinating to read about the different generations in American history but the details of S&H's theories are so general that it is impossible to prove the theory valid. They also do not include any evidence that would deny their theory.This book is a good read but it is the only S&H book worth buying. The others are merely a rehash of this one. My main issue with the book is that it only really examines a relative few of each generation and makes very broad generalizations.Most of the evidence they have for their theory of history could be explained by other factors such as technology, the economy, and attitudes towards raising children."
4,Late Boomer/Early 13er,"A really good read, almost cover-to-cover. Like all theoretical frameworks, of course, there is no perfect fit. But this book does make a very credible case for its assertions. It did help me to understand my parents' generation (and their icons like Steinem and Nader), as well as what I experienced growing up when I did."
1,Generation x is doing just fine,The death of Pat Tillman and all of the other heroes of our military fighting for our freedom in this world wide war of terror is a shining example of the greatness of generation X.The authors theory that this reactive generation X is not worthy of greatness is just not valid.
5,Outstanding book,"This book is a wonderful history and demonstrates the sociological patterns of our American history and provides insights for the future. ""The Fourth Turning"" written by the same authors ten years later, is a wonderful companion book. I suggest reading them in the order of publication to get the most out of both books."
2,Very opaque,"I started to read this book and found it much too opaque for my tastes. The authors may make some insightful observations, but I thought they were rather flimsy and not worth my time"
5,Awesome book- a must read!,"I suggest everyone reads this book! It will definitely change how you think and comprehend history and the future to come.The authors put into great details the cycle of history and how things ""cycle"" itself due to the generation setup."
5,:The History of America's Future,Going to be a great resource. Came in a timely manner and in good condition.
1,Very much disappointed,"It was too tight for my TX! After closing, I can only pry open the cover with a screw driver and it ended up leaving 3 small dents on the side of my PDA, plus scratching the stylus.Also, the opening lid is built on the bottom half of the cover which is kind of strange. I have a hard case for my T3 and the lid is on the top half. That makes opening much easier as your opening hand would have something to grapple on.Maybe it was a defective unit but I was definitely very disappointed."
3,RhinoSkin for TX - Not bad,"This is my second RhinoSkin case. The first lasted about 5 years subjected to pretty rough treatment. This one was not up the the same standard that I had come to expect from Saunders. The latch did not close securely nor did it click as it appeared to be designed to do. I did a bit of surgery and bending and now it works better, still no click on closure, but pretty secure. I have had it open while cliped to my belt several times. A feature that did not appear with the first case for about 4 years of use.Still, a very hearty case, but come on Saunders, you can do better.On the whole, I would still recommend it to anyone with a Palm TX."
5,Exactly what it should be,I have had this case for about a month. It fits the TX perfectly with all cut outs matching as well. I am even able to listen to music with the case closed because there is a back cut out / grate for the rear speaker on the TX. The finish on the case is attractive and does not easily show finger prints.I love this case and think anyone wanting to protect their Palm TX investment should have one.
4,Decent case for your money.,"The case protected my PDA from the ravages of books, keys and whatever else found its way to the bottom of my book bag. It held up very well, save for some scuffs on it. The 2 SD card holders are a good idea, in theory, but I never actually used them."
2,Tight fit...no kidding!,"This case protects well, but getting to your palm is a different story. The TX fits in there very tightly and opening the case is a pain. Hopefully you won't break too many fingernails trying to do it. I guess this was originally designed for the T5 which is why it fits the way it does. Wouldn't recommend this, but from what it seems there aren't too many great cases for it."
3,OK Case,As far as protection goes this thing is good. Other than that it is a bit cumbersome to open- the release tab seems like it would work better on the other half.
2,Could be better,"I have been looking for a hard case for my Palm TX for a while. I saw the RhinoSkin and from the reviews decided to try it. My initial reaction was favorable, the case was sturdy and form fitting to the Palm. My major gripes are that the clasp for keeping the case closed is somewhat loose. I tried wearing the Palm on my belt with the included belt clip attachment but the case always swung open as I moved around. Then while in class, due to the highly polished exterior, it slid off my lap and fell 2 feet landing on a corner of the case, breaking the flimys plastic piece used to keep the Palm in place inside the case, as well as warping the case and damaging my Palm. This happened two weeks after getting the case. I was able to bend the case back into alignment, and still use it, but I was a bit disappointed."
5,Tough case,My TX fits nicely in the cushioned case which is very strong. It protects very well from any (almost inevitable) drops and also makes access very easy. It easily fits in a pocket and the memory card holders are pretty handy.
4,"Nice Case, Easy accessibility","Nice sturdy case, little slippery but to be expected with an aluminum case. Love the access to all the vitals (sd card, charging port, stylus, headphone jack, power button, etc...) though larger headphone plugs and patch cords are a little tight to plug in. Holds up to the occasional drop (happens more than i'd like to admit), still closes and latches ok though naturally not quite as tight as it did when new. The case has protected my palm well. Must remove palm from case to put in cradle (I expected that), but it is no problem since installing and remove case is extremely easy and takes only a split second (very happy with that design). Would be happy to buy again if my own clumsiness happens to defeat the cases usability ;). Overall i am very happy with the product."
5,Good Case,This is a solid/sturdy little case... No complaints for what it is. I use this thing for holding my TX while in the gym. Currently using Acrocat's PDAbs Workout log and listening to music while in the gym...The only thing that you need to remember is that this product is made of metal which make its hard to use bluetooth headphones while the cases lid is closed... Duh... Thinking of using this case for a general purpose/everyday case and then using a Clear (plastic) case for the gym only....
3,"solid, but difficult to open and a bit rough",Fit great and look pretty strong. It is so difficult to open and the case unless you just ate something sweet. Dropped it once try to pry it open with my fingers. Luckily I was on the sofa. The outside case is not sanded completetly as you can feel some rough spots which is annoying something.
1,it doesn't fit for Palm TX,"Even though it claims to be for PALM TX..........yet, it doesn't fit!!!!If you have a TX, and wants to protection, this is not the right choice!!!"
4,FINALLY,"I searched almost everywhere for a good case for my palm TX, this is the best case for the TX. THere is just one problem, it does not fit correctly, there is a little gray plastic strip they have inside. Its easily removed with a scissors and extremely unnoticable after its removed. Once removed it makes the product perfect for the palm tx."
3,"Very Protective, but bulkier than expected","Saunders 00497 RhinoSkin Aluminum Hardcase for Palm Tungsten TX/T5For protection of my Palm PDA, this has to be the best. It is quite bulky however. I have had issues with the door getting caught on my jacket and opening and it is tremendously difficult to get the case off of the holster clip. I usually just have to take the clip off of my belt. It does have a nice soft inner lining, which can hold two extra memory cards. If you are looking for protection, this is it. I am ambivalent about my purchase as I would like something less obtrusive."
4,Try some locktite on the screw,"Go to an auto supply store and get a tube of loctite. There are several kinds - one is removable, just takes a little extra torque and the other kind drys, well, permanently. I'd use the permanent kind, I think it is the red, but you should ask for permsnent. There are red, blue, and purple, in order of most strength to least.Put a drop on the screw thread and a drop in the hole, and tighten the screw. Leave the case alone for the specified drying time. Superglue is an idea but it won't work as well since it has good pull resistance but low shear resistance and screw unscrewing is shear. Loctite is the product for the job.Keep it clean, wipe up any excess before it dries and wear it on something other than your best pants and belt the first time. But for screws that come loose, loctite red or blue (depending on whether you are ever going to try and take the screw out or not) have been the industry standard solutions for 50 years.[...]"
3,Needs better design,"This hard-shell aluminum case by rhinoskin does indeed protect the TX from injury. However, the aluminum latch seems less-sturdy than the case for my T-3 (entire unit was stolen). Sometimes when I have the unit on my hip and walking (using the belt clip), the case will spring open and hang down.I know too that the mfgr says to keep the post tightened if you use the belt clip. A word of warning. Mine consistently and routinely 'unscrews itself' and suddenly my TX falls to the ground (usually concrete). Good thing? It's unharmed. Bad--how much shock can the TX take?My recommendation--don't get this case unless the latch is fixed. (I'm not factoring in the post system because other mfgrs have wrestled with the problem of putting on a post for a belt-clip and are running into the same challenge of keeping the case 'slim' for pocket use, and yet being able to adapt it for belt-clip use. The latch, however, is a *major* problem that could and should be remedied."
2,"a little too ""budget""","I bought this foil for use in my fencing class and have been completely disappointed. I should have returned it when i saw that the blade did not fit into the handle properly, but I figured, it's just a practice weapon. The problem is, the improper fitting causes the whole assembly to loosen during use. I have to stop and tighten the bolt at least once every class. I really don't recommend this product."
5,Incredible,"This album is one of the best I've ever owned. Their drummer is probably my favorite of any band I've ever listened to. The music keeps you listening, always anxious to hear the next part even if you've memorized the cd. If you have any extra cash laying around you should definitely BUY THIS CD!"
1,NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS!!!,"Warning!!! These ""extended versions"" are not the original versions. They may be longer, but they use different orchestration than the originals. Sounds like someone took her vocals and did corny ""90's remixes"" Just terrible!!!!!"
1,"Also stunned by the ""spam"" reviews here","I have to agree with prior anti-spam reviewer, and didn't buy for the same reason... When 8 out of 10 reviews are IDENTICAL, written by the same person in IDENTICAL verbiage except for each title line, one really has to wonder what's going? Is this one of those paid PR hacks who plant sham reviews for a living? But wait, all these bogus rave reviews aren't just spam, they could be considered a scam, couldn't they?"
3,"Not in ""good"" shape...I would say ""fair""","The pages are really brown, and when I opened the book, the spine cracked and loosened a couple of the pages. Still readable, however....."
4,Great book on an often ignored part of WWII,"I was vaguely aware that fighting occurred in Alaska during the war, saw a history channel show that hit the highlights. This book puts it into perspective. The author has a fine gift to tell the story and make you feel how miserable the weather made the combatants on both sides, and how nearly impossible it was to even close to combat."
5,The Thousand Mile War by Brian Garfield,"Having served in the Aleutians durning the Cold War and part of the Vietnam War, my interest was heightened. Also, having a dear friend who was actually there from 1940 through 1945 and hearing him tell of the characters in the book was enlightening. The book was well written, well researched and gripping in its ""real life"" portrayal. I recommend this book to all who like to read about actual events and see their realationship to the bigger picture."
3,The bullied go after the bullies,"The beginning of the book deals with an attack on a pretty, rich girl - Birgit, and other attacks of bullies on other students at Grandview High. I think many kids can relate to being picked on in some way - and the examples of bullying vary widely from name-calling to creative nastiness to pure mean-spirited violence.So, some of those who have been bullied decide to create a secret team to punish the bullies. They call themselves the Hit Squad. What happens after the first ""hit"" makes Mickey, one of the team members, who is living with a foster family, question how much he enjoys getting revenge. He REALLY likes Birgit and wants to fit in, but sometimes he catches himself wondering about what he's doing. His foster sister encourages him to think about what he's doing when he involves an older foster sibling in a ""hit"" on two especially mean bulllies, but it takes a tragedy for Mickey to realize that violence isn't the answer."
3,tape,"It is clear. It sticks. There were six rolls. It is exactly as expected. Slightly thicker than normal tape, same width as normal tape."
5,Be serious - who doesn't love Scotch tape.,"I am not a brand snob about many things, but Scotch tape is one of them.Scotch transparent tape is far and away the best multi-use tape out there. The transparent tape is, in my opinion, better than the Scotch Magic tape, as it seems to have a stronger hold on a bigger variety of surfaces. I use it for many things in my classroom, around the house, and in my craft room and it has never let me down!"
5,Nice scotch tape,"Nice clear tape. Ready out of the box and i put it in my holder. Perfect for christmas wrapping. As expected and good price, it beat walmart."
5,Needed supplies,Very limited for supplies where I am stationed. Ordering this product for my office helped my customers to process paperwork and keep items neat and legible.
2,Lasted 1 month,I've always been pleased with timex products and have used them for years. This is the first one I have been dissatisfied with. The other reviews stated that the product doesn't seem to be waterproof and I wonder if this was the case with mine. I went swimming in it once and the ingiglo light stopped working. I am hoping this one was a dud. I bought a second one and will see.
5,Perfect for my interval training!,I've had the cornflower blue one for almost a year and just bought this pink one today. My Ironman has been very durable (I've had it since Nov 2009) and indispensable in my running routine (walk/run). It looks almost brand new. I got the second one because I will be incorporating speed intervals (1 min run fast/1 minute at normal pace) into my training and I want to just throw my watch on without changing the set intervals.I also wear it around town- running errands and shopping. It's a good size for my wrist (I have VERY small wrists) and is not clunky at all- it's nice and sleek. It's pretty intuitive and not hard to use.I would HIGHLY recommend this watch to others.
2,Broke within the first month!,"I was so excited to get this watch- cute, functional, seemed like a great deal. When it came, I loved it and it worked great. But within the first month, it broke. I was very careful with it- it was waterproof, but I tried to not wear it in the water. One day, while tubing down a river (nothing intense or anything, just a nice little ride) the screen fogged up and went blank. I didn't hit it on anything, I didn't tamper- nothing. Hopefully, that 1 year warrenty will come through for me. So good watch- just don't intend on wearing it when you do anything or think about water."
2,Crappy quality,"I bought this watch for my wife about a month ago and already the band has broken. It broke on both sides at the top where the buttons are. She loves this watch and thinks the color is great, although the gray has turned an ugly greenish color with a short amount of wear. The functions on this watch are great she had no problem with the buttons being hard to push like I read in other reviews. The band is what made me decide to write my first review on Amazon. This is not the first watch like this I have purchased and the other one broke in a similar fashion. I am going to buy a Casio this time."
2,not waterproof,"i have been very happy with this watch for the past year and a half and had been swimming with it before, but after a recent swim in the ocean, it completely died. i was very disappointed."
4,So good,"SO good, I bought 2 and gave a 3rd to a friend as a gift. As nurses this watch is perfect. Waterproof, rubber not metal than can get full of bacteria and goes into military time. Great colors to choose from!"
2,Timex Women's Ironman Watch,"Adequate. An acquaintance owns this same watch - it was badly faded and worn after a year. It's cheap, adequate, don't expect it to last super-long."
1,Watch popped out of strap,"I purchased this watch at Wal-Mart, and after a month or two the strap separated from the watch on the side of the buckle. It pulled away from the watch where the two upper buttons are located. The watch could be hooked back into the strap; but the strap remained loose and the upper part of the watch separated from it frequently. This continued for another month or so until today, when the watch popped completely out of the strap and was lost somewhere. This is a terrible design and I would never purchase another one."
4,Cool Watch,"I get lot's of compliments on this watch. People like how it looks. I like all of the various features, yet it is easy enough to figure out without reading the directions. I use the 3 alarms in my occupation which has been helpful. The only dislike: the band seems to get dirty easy and does not come clean with just soap and water."
5,Great Watch!,This watch was to replace an old Women's Ironman watch. It's better than expected with great new features and multiple alarms. Easy to use while running. Can't go wrong here.
4,Scholarly Research,"This is quite a scholarly work and reads like a thesis - a bit dense but well documented. The focus is in on the theory and intellectual aspects of Transcendentalism. Surprisingly little, however, on Utopianism in general, or influences of Thomas Moore in specific. I was living in Harvard MA, site of the Fruitlands, and found the book useful for research purposes."
1,The Whim of the Dragon,"The end of this book was terrible. The end of a series should be catacalismic for someone, but in this book everyone, even the bad guys, get what they want. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Definitely order a size larger,"I ordered these a while back and they are definitely smaller than expected. If you would typically go with a medium size, do yourself a favor and order the large/xl size!! The s/m is truly a small; there is nothing medium about it. Aside from the sizing issue, they are decent gloves- certainly not the best by any stretch of the imagination, but then again, you can hardly beat the price."
4,Informative but not totally accurate,"This book has more than enough information on almost every major or non-major reggae artist. The only flaw is that with some info, like the artists'albums, they listed some albums that don't even exist."
1,not what I expected,I thought this was a dvd movie its just stills and singing and way over priced I thought
2,Didn't fit,"Yes, I ordered the proper item. I have a Nikon camera, and I needed a rear lens cap.It did not fit on a single Nikon lens I own. I'm sending it back."
3,Horrible delivery cost with Adorama,"The product itself, is of course good - it's as close as you can to an original Nikon cap. But cheaper. I bought five of them, for all my lenses. But the delivery cost from Adorama was horrible expensive: 73 USD for 5 very small and lightweight items worth a total of 20 USD. I bought it with ""1-Click"" with was a big mistake as the delivery cost never shows up in advance. I have during the years bought quite a number of items from US for delivery in Sweden/Europe, but never have the delivery cost been as like this. Usually it is around 15-30 USD for items in similar weight. Never again, Adorama."
4,Very Glamorous,"Ok, I guess this is one of those that probably wasn't meant to be taken out of the box, but I did anyway because I couldn't resist. Overall this is a very beautiful doll with well-made clothes and tons of style. However, I think that the combination of the green eyes and the slightly greenish tinge to her pale glittery lipstick was a little odd. But I think it's awesome that her eyes match her dress. The gloves are nice, but frusterating. I took them off to change her into her gold mini-dress and it took nothing short of an act of God to get them back on. Ugh! They're never coming off again! For some reason the doll I got has kind of frizzy hair (not like the pics online) but it's still pretty. I absolutely love the little mannequin, it's soooo cute but some of the other accessories are just pointless, I mean, what are you supposed to do with that little scrapbook? It's a cute idea but that and the tiny pictures just don't make sense. All in all, a pretty doll."
4,"Great CD, just not IRISH","Natalie is an amazing fiddler, but she plays Cape Breton style fiddle - quite different from traditional Irish fiddle.Still a great listen."
4,"Toe tappin, foot stompin good ceol","If you enjoy traditional Irish music, this is a great collection. My only complaint is that the discs could be a little longer, throw in a few extra tracks from some other performances. Put this CD on, enjoy a pint and get ready to be transported to a smoky pub with good friends and good times"
1,A Fake!,"Item received was a cheap, homemade counterfeit. It had white adhesive labels with laser printing of just the album name o each CD. The case label was obviously photocopied, cut out by hand, and the front and back sides stapelled together."
5,Natalie Macmaster cd,"This woman is incredible. Her music is energetic, magnetic. She plays tirelessly in this live performance. I am still captivated and it's been over a year since I started listening to it."
5,First CD is 5+ STARS!,"The first CD is one my all-time favorites. It is also my favorite Natalie CD out of the 5 that I own. You can just feel the energy pouring out of her stage performance in this one. Mixing it up with the electric guitar and rock beat adds to the performance in all but one or two spots. I can listen to this one again and again and not get tired of it. The second CD is nice, too, but the noise from the dance hall detracts a bit from the otherwise lively, traditional Cape Breton dance music."
1,Returned it,I did not like this product. The ice was smaller than I expected it to be and some of the bottles leaked during transit. The smell wasn't all that great either.
5,it's the best,haave been using this for several years and i love it . not too heavy on the hair perfect for fine hair.
3,ok,"It's a good product, but for the money, Fructose root-booster by Loreal is just as good (and a lot cheaper)...plus Fructose encourages hair growth. One advantage of this product is that it does not leave hair feeling dirty."
1,It takes 2 sheets to seal one 8-1/2 x 11 paper!,"I expected to be able to laminate 10 sheets of 8-1/2 x 11 papers. After all, the package says 10-pack. What it does NOT say is that it takes TWO sheets to create one lamination. It would actually have been cheaper to have OfficeMax laminate the 10 sheets that I needed laminated. OfficeMax only charges $1 per lamination. And the lamination doesn't seem very robust or waterproof. I should have bought pouches but also wanted to use a couple sheets for some smaller items and didn't want to have buy multiple sized pouch packages. If for some reason you do buy this product, you will need a very good pair of scissors to cut it. Overall a very disappointing product."
3,"Mishmash, Unfortunately","This book is so confused about what it wants to say, it's like being trapped in a car with a neurotic babbler on a long roadtrip to nowhere. Furthermore, it's overly impressed with itself. Frankly, this book accomplished something that is rare in my readings: it left me less impressed with the subject than when I started out. After reading this, and rooting around for other literature, and projects, CBR, though it is based on a solid premise (from Philosophy, not science ;) ), is just a rhizome waiting for some soil and water."
1,"The ""WORST"" compilation I have ever came across at.","The only tracks that really stands out here is DJ Tiesto's ""suburban train"" and Ian Van Dahl's overplayed ""Will I"". The rest is just plain boring and some actually can help you sleep. Im sure there are much better Cream comps out there. Just get the import ones. This can almost be a chillout album. Save your money and get the more exciting ones."
5,Great party CD,"great CD for any party.....fav tracks are ""it's gonna be a lovely day,"" ""right on,"" ""thrill me,"" ""funk-a-tron,"" ""what does it feel like,"" ""f**k sonnet"""
2,So-So album that utterly pales in comparison to most CREAM,"I bought this album on a whim and yes, buyer's remorse set in all too quickly. Most CREAM compilations are spectacularly energizing and fun. This is more of a chill-out album but even at that, the loops and syncopation of beats are way too boring. Buy any of the EUPOHRIA or Cream Arrivals & Departures for a real ride."
1,Disappointment...,"Putting it simply: the tracks lack cohesion, failing to keep one's interest throughout the duration of the album. I simply couldn't resist the urge to hit the SKIP button on the CD player, desperately trying to find the one track that would make the album worth listening to.This volume smacks of ... commercialism, something one would hear in a Tijuana bar. Sure, it would sound great -- when one is half-conscious and hooted up on tequila shots.It is the first album and the last one in this series that I will purchase. The tracks on the CD are used on other compilations and mixed in a far more competent manner.If you're looking for a more serious trance album, one that envelops you, then the Ministry of Sound's Trance Nation series (slightly less commercial) or better still, the Global Underground series, are just the ticket and worth the expense."
5,Don't plink the torpedo...,"""A Sense of Honor"" is by far, the best book I have read in a good while. James Webb is able to illustrate a sense of companionship by those who embrace their environment. He also shows how the midshipmen react to those who aren't as ardent about their profession; i.e. John Dean.I have never read a book that depicts the Naval Academy in this way. It's amazing! You are able to see the transformation from child to adult; Mid to Officer. And the change is absolutely stunning. It is so riveting; it will make you wish that you were a part of it. You will wish that you were standing in formation with these same characters and others like them.I would recommend this book for anyone who thinks high school and college is tough. ""Baby, you ain't seen nothing yet!"""
4,Riveting,"I never attended a military school, but I found this book absorbing and a very easy read. I know the gutter language is realistic, as I suppose the amoral attitude is also. But these aspects pale into insignificance when the story itself is considered. Webb is not the writer that Pat Conroy is, and this book did not quite tear me apart as much as did The Lords of Discipline, but this book has a far more subtle message, and shows inhuman discipline is not necessarily evil. Well worth reading."
5,"""A Sense of Honor ' is great reading","When my son was offered an appointment to the United States Naval Academy I decided to find out as much as I could about it. I hadn't heard of this book, but in my search on Amazon it came up with so many favorable reviews that I bought it. I am primarily a reader of non-fiction, but the author of this book crafted it carefully from his memories at Annapolis. The characters are fictional, but many think they are portrayals of the author Webb himself, and possibly of his rival Oliver North of iran Contra fame. The scenes depicted seem real. The daily life of the midshipmen was riveting. I found the book to be a complete hit, and my son did too. The ending was a surprise to me, and I am not sure I know who the heroes and villians are. I have recommended it to others, and think readers that give it a chance won't be disappointed."
2,"Better than the first two, but...","Christine Goff is making a name for herself as an author of birding mysteries. I am no fan of the genre, but my curiosity and a good review of the series in _Birding_ magazine convinced me finally to read the books. This third installment starts quite well indeed, with fire-fighting scenes that rise a time or two from the merely convincing to the nearly gripping. But soon it falls into the tired pattern of the first two books in the series: the birding content is a bit jejune, and the mystery and its resolution are uncompelling. I bristled, too, and have not finished bristling, at the narrator's comment that ATV's are kept from some federal lands by an ""excess"" of regulation. If this is not just a severe slip in diction, it is outrageous on the part of an author who hopes to sell books to members of the birding community.But you know what? I'll probably read the next one anyway."
2,Save your $$$ and buy a book!,"If you're looking for a coaching program I am afraid this will dissapoint unless you are a real biggner.The DVD has a lot of eye candy.Cool computer graphics but lacks depth. It shows formations but fails to illustrate how to ""coach"" it on field. The section for practice games was very minimal at best. I'd say you are better off buying one of the famous coaching books, you will learn more .. a whole lot more.A couple of books to read:Skills and Strategies for Coaching Soccer AND .. Attacking Soccer. Both will give you more detailed yet simplified coaching info than the DVD. And cost half price!"
2,smells like it is for a man,didnt like it very much / it smells like it is for menbut it came before time
5,Rave Reviews,"I just love this product, I get so many compliments. I'm told it smells very sensous and seductive. Thanks AMAZON for the great prices!"
2,"Weird ""perfume headache"" smell","I was surprised, both because I bought this without smelling it first, and also because this scent received rave reviews. Let me tell you...this perfume smells odd, is way too strong, and doesn't fit with the other Curve products I know and love. The description says floral, citrus, and vanilla musk and I smelled 85% floral, 10% citrus, and 5% vanilla musk. This is nice for people who like feminine floral, but not nice for people like me who appreciate oriental, musky, heavier, womanly scents. Lesson learned: I will never buy a scent without having smelled/tested it first.That said, I would order from Fragrance Net again --- I LOVE the sample scents and also appreciated the coupons."
1,STINKSSSSS......SMELLS LIKE BUG SPRAY!,"VERY DISAPPOINTED, LOVE THE CURVE SOUL FOR MEN..... THOUGHT I WOULD TRY THIS FOR MYSELF, BOY WAS I WRONG! VERY STRONG & SMELLS LIKE BUG SPRAY! YUCK"
1,smells a great deal like water,"Smells great, similar to Angel, my favorite, deliscious flowers and spice...for about 14 seconds. Then it's gone.I can't recommend, not cheap at any price."
1,Smells worse than dog s***,If I could I would give no stars at all for this item. Don't buy it unless you wanna smell like a dog
5,Wonderful Fragrance,I LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE!!!! I first purchased a small trial bottle at a department store and I absolutely fell in love with it. I just HAD to get a large bottle! It's the best combination of sensual and sophisticated that I have ever smelled.
5,Curve,love using this product. It smells very good. I use it all the time. I am very happy with this product!
5,Superlative young adult picture book of castle under siege,"This is a great book not only for young people who want to learn about castles and the medieval lifestyle but also adults who are first learning about the period.It's one thing to read text but it's even better to see pictures which bring it to life.In this picture book, we get information about the people who live in a castle, its defenses, a medieval feast, a hunting party, preparation of a siege and then each step showing how the siege and battles take place.Invigorating to read. Also, check out THE WORLD OF THE MEDIEVAL KNIGHT by Christopher Graven (another illustrated book)."
3,NOTHING UNIQUE FROM ANY OTHER NATURAL HORSEMANSHIP TRAINING,"I had hoped for perhaps a somewhat unique, Native American perspective on horsemanship; something a little different from othe natural horsemanship trainers selling books & dvds. But, this is the same methodology used by most all of them. It makes a pretty coffee table book, but has nothing new to offer unless this is your first foray into natural horsemanship. Basically, establishing yourself as the ""Alpha"" or leader, based on the well-known fact that horses want to follow a leader they trust. It emphasizes not using force or abuse & demonstrates how to control the horse's actions once you have established the basic trust/respect level required. I also viewed the dvd & was disappointed that Pony Boy used a perfectly trained horse in all his demonstrations. BORING! It's more of a pretty picture book than a useful instruction you can apply to your untrained horse. Not a book worth keeping in my horse book library."
5,"BEAUTIFUL BOOK WITH A MESSAGE. OKAY, SO OTHER ""HORSE WHISPERERS"" HAVE A SIMILAR MESSAGE. THIS IS BEAUTIFUL","Sick of boring old dressage? Overdone eventing? Wacky Western riding? In this stunningly beautiful volume, GaWaNi Pony Boy describes the roots of Native American riding. When Europeans arrived in the Americas, horses had disappeared long before. GaWaNi shows how the first Americans took to horses-- and created an awe inspiring bond and culture. I have not met GaWaNi, but I knew my husband would love his horsemanship the minute I saw this book. GaWaNi doesn't clip his horse's faces-- something my husband totally approves."
1,BAD,THESE HIGHLIGHTER SMEAR INKJET COPIES WORSE THEN ANY OTHER HIGHLIGHTER WE HAVE THEY PULL THE INK RIGHT FROM THE PAPER
5,Great Highlighters,"Best Highlighter I've ever used. Great for school purposes -- highlighting in textbooks, handouts, printouts, etc. Does not smudge, great precision, good color, sharp contrast.Criticism: The darker colors are too dark to highlights with. The blue, pink, and purple, especially, are WAY too dark to highlight with and then be able to read the text easily. Having said that, the yellow / green / red / orange are awesome! Great product!"
5,excellent product,bought this product for college purposes. Any color that you may choose from will not disappoint you. they will not smear or damage print papers and the colors will not be seen at the other side of the page.
4,Excellent Resource,"When I've read more of it, perhaps I'll expand on this, but for now, know that this is an excellent resource in Christian ethical thought. Good selection of schools of thought and thought-provoking questions to get you started thinking ethically yourself."
5,Great addition to my Yoga routine,"Nice feel, nice weight. I use these at my yoga class instead of the communal blocks and take them to use at retreats. Other students have commented on how nice they look."
5,Coleman Cable 04187 12/3-Wire Gauge Multi-Outlet Vinyl Extension Cord...,Great addition to my sound!!!! 14 Gauge is in the Garbage. Will definately purchase more power cords for my setup!
3,extension cord,This cord is not really flexible and the three way doesn't hold the male end very tight. It is a cord that is worth what you pay. For the occasional user it is a good cord for everyday it is a little lacking.
4,Health advices made easy to understand and follow,"In this book '7 simple steps' Dr. Willix provides medical explanations for his advices on a basic level and fortifies them with his own life experience and solid medical research. He presents the elementary steps of how to improve your health (and live to 100)and feel good in a way that makes them achievable with minimum effort. He provides his very practical suggestions for physical and mental exersises, diet, vitamins and food supplements in a very beleivable way because many of them he follows himself. The book is easy to read and makes you want to try it out."
3,perfume,"I absolutely love this perfume....1st found it 22 years ago on my honeymoon.....followed a lady and her ""scent"", and asked her what it was....lol.... so then it was discontinued. I then found it online...read the reviews...and I remember reading one lady saying that the scent doesn't last very long....maybe due to it being older.....sorry to say, I love this smell, but I feel the scent doesn't last all day either..... very sad...... But I will still wear it."
2,Too Small,The price was too expensive for the size! I was expecting something bigger. The perfume was good though I really liked the smell. Just would not purchase
4,Sweet,"I was shopping for a winter scent,I decided to give Lou Lou a try since Cacherel makes few favorites,including what I consider my signature scent.Plus the bottle is just wonderful.It's an intense floral,warm and feminine, quite sweet sweet almost reminishing of somenthing sugary and edible.Dab very lighty cause it can be overpowering. Great sillage and longevity.I don't love it on myself,but if i get pass the initial top notes I like it"
2,Don't Waste Your Money: Handheld Spyro STINKS,"Okay, first the crummy boring storyline, then the fact that it's almost imppossible to control and the fact that I can't tell the end of a cliff from a lake ( They're the same color ) so I fall off all the time, also since you can hardly steer, it's hard to aim at enemies, so I end up getting killed. Buy the Spyro games for PS2 and gamecube but leave this one OUT."
5,Hot Stuff,"My sister had gotten Spyro: Season on Ice when it first came out (2001 or 2002, I believe). I was just starting middle school, and this was the game we constantly fought over playing (in the end, it was the little sister who got the prize). When I saw this superpack, I had to have it. Almost ten years later, and this game is still fun to play. It is very easy now that I'm not ten years-old anymore (I remember agonizing over certain levels for weeks, levels that now only take me thirty minutes to an hour). It's a pretty straight forward game. Bad guys are taking over and it's your job to play as Spyro to get rid of the bad guys via clearing out each level in each world and unfreezing fairies. Sypro 2: Season of Flame has the same concept. While the graphics and gameplay might be a little outdated now, it was hot stuff when it first came out and still brings back that feeling now."
5,Fun!,I particularly love the spyro games and this is a great set for anyone else who likes the series! The graphics and colors are great and the levels are challenging but fun!
2,Ugh,"I bought this game, really excited because I loved Spyro and Crash on Playstation, but I wish I had read the reviews first. It's not only boring, but irritatingly difficult. I bought this at the same time I bought my GBA, and I hope that other games are better."
4,"This game is challenging, fun, and full of adventure.","This game is challenging, fun, and full of adventure."
4,Slight Increase,"Fits perfectly. however, the packaging came and there was red ""gunk"" on the packaging around the air filter. i dont know if that supposed to be there or what but ive had it for a few months now and seems to be working fine. Ive noticed a slight boost in performance with accelerating."
3,"On the whole good, but from the British point of view","I like the multicolor format, the quality of the paper, and the binding (though I wish the print were larger with larger margins).On the negative side. . .This is written from the British point of view. Sometimes it provides the US counterpart, sometimes not. This is esp a problem with the English def. is a British colloquialism or slang. Also sometimes the def. of a French term is into the corresponding Gallicism in English where a native English counterpart would be infinitely more familiar.The dictionary has less of the offensive politicization/leftist slant of other Collins dictionaries but still could not get away from the familiar offensive male-bashing."
1,order arrived incomplete,"upon receiving the pump did not come with hoses or filters that come in the picture, just received a pump connectors and connector that releases the water at the end of the pump, I get incomplete request"
1,Mislead buyer,"Don't buy this product. It leaks water badly. It does not get hot enough to press your clothes the way it advertises. I tried it on a few different types of clothes jeans, sweaters, tee shirts, etc, just to be sure I gave it a fair shot. It just does not simply live up to it's claims. If you can afford it, buy one of the more expensive one's. This is a waste of time and consumer money."
2,Leaky Bugger,"I love the concept of ironing this way, I just needed a machine that didn't leak out all of the water for steam all over the table."
1,Stay away.,I tried two of these. I used the first and it quit heating up in the first 2 weeks. I sent it back to Amazon and it was promptly replaced. The next unit worked fine. After 3 weeks I threw the big box out thinking I was in the clear. Wrong....steam quit working and it also had heating problems less than a week later. Stay away.
5,Wonderful Live Performance,"This CD, recorded live at the Coffee House Extempore in Minneapolis, is a fine sampling of Bill Staines's art as a songwriter, singer, guitarist, and yodeler. Every song on this CD is a winner (Bill Staines wrote most, although not all, of them).The sound is fine for a live recording, and Guy Van Duser's guitar picking is particularly good."
5,Love Chris Rock,I love this show. It was funny and a really good deal price wise. I would recommend it to any fan of his.
1,Don't cut paper,Bought these for my 5 year old to practice cutting before kindergarten. They broke within minutes after failing to cut anything. Would not recommend.
3,THE desert island CD for folk fans!,"The chestnut old folk songs from the Lomax collections and SingOut! Reprints come alive with exuberance and energy. Their freshness is matched only by their timelessness. The piano of Butch Thompson and the string wizardry of Ostrushko, Taylor, et. al. weave with Koerner's sense of song to take American songs and make a masterpiece of the heart of American roots music."
5,True American Folk Music,"This is American folk music the way it was meant to be played. Mr. Koerner isn't afraid to have a beat, and feeling and humor haven't been sacrificed in pursuit of an artificial sweetness."
1,Herr Getty 3D,Too pshycadelic for me. Confusing w/o concise descriptions. Hard to understand what they are showing you except the droning chant like narration
2,Not sure I get it,"This seems more like an ""open"" study. It wasn't laid out in a very clear fashion. I was hoping for something that was a bit more formal to work with my teenage son (or even younger daughters.) I'll come back to it later, and maybe it will come together better in my mind then, but for now I found it lacking."
3,Not quite what I was looking for,The glasses were a bigger than I expected and seemed more like water glasses/goblets to me. Relatively delicate glass also. But overall definitely a good price and will be used. Nice shape for a water glass.
2,Complicated plot - didn't finish this book,"I checked this book out of the library because my wife is named Carolyn. Although the storyline is good, there were so many characters and the plot was so complicated, I finally gave up on it."
2,"Short Lived, Gets Expensive To Replace",This brand of violin strings doesn't hold tone for long and breaks too easily durning tuningso I won't purchase again.
1,Brown's least cogent work,Brown wrote this one well into his 80s and you can see age taking its toll on him. The book praises Islamic mysticism and is his most religious work. It is a complete failure written by an old man who wasn't thinking straight.
2,Simple introduction to Voodoo terms.,"This book is simply a little tract on voodoo beliefs and common terms. No real applicable knowledge of ritual or religion is handed to the reader, but if you have heard a voodoo term and have no idea what it is, this would be a handy book to have. There are lists of the supposed power of certain stones, animal remains, and sundry dubious substances. While it does serve as a light-read and cursory probe into the subject, it is by no means the ""Voodoo Handbook of Cult Secrets"" the title would have you believe."
2,Secrets!! What Secrets??,"There are no secrets revealed here, so please do not let the title get you. Simply it is a very thin booklet of translations of words used in Voodoo, as well as the names of the Lwas, the Might Spirits of Voodoo. If you want to learn some definitions then this is some what worth the $4.95, but if you want a book on Voodoo Secrets, Religion and Magic, check out The Voodoo Grimoire, by El Negro Jose and Secrets Of Voodoo by Milo Rigaud. Both currently in stock at Amazon.com"
1,I pay for this?,"I'm very dessapointed about this book,only is like a voodoo dictionary, but does not show any ritual or spell, and the illustrations of the veves are not the authentics, Is sad that the author have written a so bad book, because the book of ""Secrets of Magical Seals: A Modern Grimoire of Amulets, Charms, Symbols and Talismans"" is very good, but this one NOT."
2,not really secrets,"I agree with the person who wrote before me, if you want an in depth boos about Voodoo, get Secrets Of Voodoo by Milo Rigaud, although the book is so in depth and hard to read you probably need a mentor/teacher to explain a lot of it or you will be lost (unless you already practice voodoo or have already studied a bit)."
2,Too many quirks spoil the broth,"Although not a bad writer, Brenchley cannot easily fit his tale of mysterious amnesia with his tale of an ambiguous angel; it was as if Buffy the Vampire Slayer and NYPD Blue decided to air a crossover episode--the genres are just too different to be a good fit unless handled brilliantly, which is not here the case.I myself found the mystery angle compelling, and was annoyed when the angel angle intruded. This wasn't enough to put me off his work entirely--this was an interesting attempt by a writer new to me--but I can't recommend it as a satisfying read.Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less."
4,Live 'tators,"I prefer the ROIR one (New York, New York but we all know the real title is F*** 'em If They Can't Take A Joke) but there's always room for more Tators! Ross burns throughout.Check out Mighty High...In Drug City. Cover art by the same guy who did D.F.F.D."
3,Its good just needed to show steps at better angles,Ok video some of the steps were hard to comprehend and the camera angles need to change. In future simiplify so even the biggest begginner will be able to practice.
3,Not my favorite,"I have many books on pilates, and this is my least favorite. I was expecting to love it, being that she's the ""trainer to the stars"". I found her book to be pretty basic, and she only covers matwork, which is only one component of pilates. I would have liked for her to discuss the reformer, etc.This would be a good book for someone just starting pilates, and only wanting to do matwork. However, even at that, I found her pictures and descriptions of each move not to be the easiest to follow. Other books have better directions for doing the moves correctly."
2,hard to follow,"I am a beginner to pilates, although i exercise regularly, including yoga. But, I found this book an insufficient introduction to the practice. The descriptions of the positions are dfficult to follow. There are photos to help illustrate the positions, but sometimes the photos aren't placed directly beside the description of that pose. The worst part, however, is that there isn't enough help with knowing when to inhale and exhale."
2,Not for beginners,"I agree with most of the other low-rating reviews: if you're new to Pilates and aiming to learn from a book, you're probably better off picking something else.I do like extensive written instructions--no such thing as too many hints on how to perform the moves. But I agree with others that the photos are not well-synched to the written notes, and that many exercises need revision to be clear to the uninitiated. Ms. Winsor should ""usability test"" this book on novices to see what common questions they have, and produce a second edition that answers them.Most damning, I think, is that the book is all about your ""Powerhouse"" (presumably the same as what everyone else calls the ""core"" muscles) but doesn't tell novices how to find them. Baffling. The book really needs some very simple exercises to help the student build confidence that they're using the right muscles, and how to distinguish ""powerhouse"" from ""stomach muscles""."
3,Convincing But Stops There,"I'm sold. I would like to try the Pilates Method. I read the book and became very excited about getting fit and all the benefits of Pilates that Marni Windsor promises. However, in practicality, learning from the book from scratch leaves too much to be desired. I began to search and was very surprised to find that with the increasing popularity of this method, nobody has made a video.? How is this possible?Obviosly the best way to learn and accomplish these exercises is to have and instructor. A video would be the next best thing."
1,Don't waste your money,"I found the book very difficult to follow. The photographs were not clear, and directions were confusing. Even after several attempts to practice the movements, I never felt as though I were performing them correctly."
1,Confusing and Hard to Follow,"I could not get past the first exercise on page 47. At the end of the instructions you are told to ""Repeat the cycle until you have counted to 100"". It is not clear where the ""cycle"" begins. On page 153 there is a modified version of the same exercise. The written instructions do not match the photos.The instructions for each exercise are long. With details on breathing and transitions. This kind of detail would work best with a personnal trainer. A detailed and well produced video would be much better than this book."
2,Good book but not quite there,"I found this book to be a good introduction to Pilates. Unfortunately, it never gave me the confidence to continue with the program. I felt there were descriptions or directions left out or just not thorough enough for the true beginner. On several exercises, I never felt I was correct in form and needed a little more direction (e.g. the Hundred). This is one of the most important moves in terms of breathing and control of your powerhouse. A much better book to use is Brooke Siler's The Pilates Body. The directions are much clearer and you start out much slower in terms of adding movements to your routine (15 min. a day vs. 1 hour). The time issue is big if you are trying to establish a new routine in an already tight schedule."
2,Not For Beginners!!,"This book is definitely not for beginners even if it mentions otherwise. I had never tried Pilates until I bought this book, it looked like it would be something that beginners could do -- NOPE. The exercises are not explained in detail enough to perform correctly, some are not explained enough so that you know what to do, I ended up making guesses, which is not something you should do with Pilates. This book is well written and made me more interested in Pilates, enough so to go and buy another book on it. I bought the Pilates book by Brooke Siler which had a wonderful modified beginner Pilate moves. It was easier to understand and perform. This book is probably alright for people who have been previously exposed to Pilates and have a general idea of what it is about and the moves that are performed."
1,Very disappointing,"The directions are unclear and don't coordinate with the photo illustrations. Nothing could be worse for a beginning Pilates student. If anything, this book discouraged me from trying mat Pilates at home. Still looking for a good basic how-to book on this subject."
3,There are better books,I've become a Pilates junkie because it's really true when they say you'll have a whole new body after 30 sessions. So I've bought many books and tapes on the subject. This book is good in that it covers the complete mat workout. There are very wordy descriptions and some photos of each exercise but it would have worked better if they had numbered the written sequence to match with appropriately numbered photos. The book by Brooke Siler does a much better job I think in describing the exercises.The exercises vary slightly in all the Pilates books/routines that I've read/seen and this will add a few more to the repertoire. There is an interesting intro/history and some supplemental exercises for special conditions (the author swears Pilates helped to control her asthma). This book does have more modifications of some of the exercises than the Siler book (and more name dropping) so that may make this book worth it to you - even though it is harder to follow.
4,exercise memory!,"The detailed instructions on each exercise are extremely helpful for those of us who are ""word"" people, but it is probably most useful as an accompaniment to a video or to working with a certified instructor in a studio. I am doing both of those and found this helpful, but if one were clueless you might not ""get it"" just from the book.By the way, one reviewer asked why the exercises aren't listed separately by level of skill required. The answer is that in the Pilates method the sequence of exercises is considered extremely important AND when you are more advanced you continue to do the more basic exercises (sometimes with more difficult positioning of legs, arms or body.)"
4,Great Home Guide,"This book is a great home guide...but I recommend taking some classes to learn the correct form. I've been taking classes in conjunction with doing the book workout. Mari gives good descriptions of exactly how to do each movement, but sometimes it's a little difficult to understand EXACTLY what you should be doing from a book...this is where some classes can help. One thing about the book that's BETTER than the classes is that Mari divides the positions in to beginner, intermediate, and advanced....which sometimes is not explained in a class. I know that pilates class are expensive and the book is cheap....but you can really get a whole lot more out of the book by taking a few classes to learn proper form & understand how the exercises flow together and THEN continue at home for your workout (and money savings)."
3,Disarming Sincerity,"A lot of the reviews for Wayne Scott's ""This Weary Way"" are wildly enthusiastic, because of its stripped-down return to tradition, its obvious sincerity, and the compelling story his son has documented in songs over the past few years. I agree, but for me these factors do not entirely compensate for the home recordinng technology used. It's called ""clipping,"" a distortion introduced when the signal is too large and the tops of all the waves get cut off. It impairs the vocal tracks. On the other hand, maybe there are some who think this sound is aesthetic, being present frequently most recently in the grunge genre."
1,Amazon Ripped me off EDIT (fixed),"All I can say is, they took my money, but didn't let me download the album.I can find the receipt, when I look at my digital orders, it gives me a link to ""Launch Amazon Cloud Player"", when I click it, the player launches, but says I have no music !I can't find a link where I can request help.Thus the ""review'.EDIT fixedI finally found a link to report a problem (buried), they responded within 6 hours (christmas day), they gave me access to it in their ""cloud player"".I can't understand why the browser's download wasn't good enough, now you have to install another piece of bloatware (Amazon mp3 downloader), or transfer it to their ""cloud player"", and download one song at a time."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I bought this trimmer based on trust of the Fiskars name. The first one I bought, the metal on the top of the cutter was peeling off. I was wary, but exchanged it for another assuming it was an anomaly. The next one was OK looking, but when I used it to cut, the blade shaved away some of the metal on the base and then the arm caught and would not cut. Don't waste your money on this product."
5,Super trimmer,"Have had zero issues and was delighted to discover lifetime warranty, the company said no need to register product, would just have to send photo and description if there was an issue and they would replace the item. That makes me happy as it was expenive, so far well worth it for making cards, etc."
4,$25.00 Solution To A $150.00 Problem,"I have a 95 YJ Rio Grand. I decided to purchase a new set of rims & tires. The package price wasn't too bad at $150.00 per each wheel & tire. I had a really hard time deciding if it was worth buying a 5th for a spare or taking the chance of covering up the factory rim & tire.Bestop has always proven to be pricier than the others, but the quality is second to none. The cover looks great & gives the rear of the Jeep a clean look. I used it on a 225/75R 15. The fit is tight (just right), the stitching & fabric seem to be real strong. It matches my Bestop Safari Top perfectly.I gave it a 4 star rating only because there is no way to run a cable through it to lock it in place. I really don't think this cover will last too long, not because of the quality. Someone may think it will look just as good on their Jeep & take it. Hope not."
2,this cookbook is for chefs,and I am not a chef. pluse alot of the ingredients are stuff I don't even buy or have ever seen in my local grocery store.
5,Secret Gourmet Sauce!,"Here's a wonderful ""secret sauce"" you can keep on hand to perk up, salads, pasta, fish dishes, or any other foods that need a burst of complex flavor that you will find nowhere else. This magical elixir imported from the Amalfi Coast of Italy is an absolute ""must have"" in any gourmet kitchen. I recommend it without hesitation."
3,More,"The product was exactly what I was looking for. A gift for my brother, which he was not expecting it was received and is being enjoyed. He is looking for all the ways that he can use it, in cooking. A URL with ways to use the product, would have been nice to include on the packaging."
2,coasting....,"Like most great groups whose best work is behind them, the Orb are now coasting on name recognition and fan loyalty. There is nothing truly moving or groundbreaking on this cd. Which is not to say it's bad. It's just not that good. Even the reunion with Jimmy Cauty ( who recorded with Alex Patterson in the Orb before they released their first album ) does not seem to inspire.Dull and soul-less."
3,The rapper ruins it,"I've been into the Orb for quite sometime and have hunted down some of their more rare selections. I purchased the Japanese edition last fall and enjoyed it fairly well though the first track, 'From a Distance', is a bit too fluffy. I was passing through the UK and saw the recently released UK version with a different track sequence and mixes (one of those being a great rework of the previously mentioned 'fluffy' track). Track two, 'Aftermath', is horrid. Me Soon T sounds like an infant with a mouthful of something foul. Alex Patterson's production on that track is quite lackluster as well, so there's no hope but skipping to the next track. Fear not, The rest of the disc is fantastic. It is a shame that track two is such a digression from what is otherwise a five star album."
2,Little light left,It's always sad to see a creative force eventually aspire to dwell in the shadow of one's former self.
3,The Orb vs lil' Bow Wow,"The Orb was for me always intellectual music. I wonder if they tried to catch the U.S market this time. Probably they hit the mark, when I see some reviews here. One reviewer lines up this album with 'Orblivion', I can't follow this artistic thought. When it is for me a mental experience, sitting 2am in front of the computer with Orb's previous subliminar masterpieces in backround, this Bicycles output is rather used for listening it from a transistor while mixing cement in the open. 'The Orb' ends for me at 'Orblivion' and Patersons 'Voyage Into Paradise"". This I call INCREDIBLE. Unfortunatly, Bicycles' degraded to mainstream radio music. But I'm waiting."
2,Great -- until it stops working,"I received this clock as a gift late last year. It's design is really amazing, and it's also great how you can type in messages for the clock to display. On holidays, it also has messages which come up on those days. The messages look cool floating in the air.One day, though, the clock suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason. Surprise, surprise, the warranty had just expired. However, there was a piece of paper in the box that mentioned my problem and said what to do. So I unplugged the clock, took out its batteries, and restarted it again. Lo and behold, it worked. For one minute. Then it stopped. I tried this over and over; the clock always went for a minute and then stopped again. Fifty bucks seems like a bit much for a clock that lasts just past the warranty, and then quits."
2,Not The Best,I didn't really care for this SVH book. I hated Todd the Clod falling for the Snob Suzanne. I do not feel sorry for people at all like her and I'm glad Jessica was mean to her.
1,Dirty little Secret,"The RUN.EXE program on thes locked flash drives has a Virus on them. I can't find a way to clean or erase it. If you have used the drive the virus can be cleaned on your computer, but appears again every time you use these drives."
2,A Grave rewrite is needed,"Well, I'm not sure how to begin. While the back cover synopsis is intriguing, the execution leaves something to be desired. The book was by far one of the least well written that I've read. Grimes is constantly going off on tangents that seem to have no bearing on the story. I found myself lost several times and having to go back and figure out what was supposed to be happening.The only reason I gave this book 2 stars instead of one was that the author seemed to get back on track for the last 50-75 pages.Overall, I cannot recommend this book and will only give the author one more try before ""writing"" her off completely."
1,A mendacious rant disguised as a novel,"The Grave Maurice isn't really a mystery novel; it is a long winded, ill-informed rant against Premarin, a prescription medication that saves women's lives. I know what I'm talking about - this drug was the only thing that helped me after an emergency surgery to save my life left me with a severe hormone imbalance.Back to the book: shallow, unbelievable characters, too many coincidences and too many dangling threads at the end. One murder and its solution are tossed around like an inconvenient afterthought, and the motivation for the main kidnapping/prisoner/torture scenario is too weak for words."
2,Grimes on a Downward Spiral,"I've read all the Richard Jury novels. The last two have been awful...meandering plots, weak endings, characters who have little credibility. I agree. It's time to bury Ruchard Jury."
1,Disappointing,"Better get a copy at your local library first before investing on this book. I'm a Martha Grimes fan, but this book is boring. Several things turned me off. First, the story revolved around another smart, ethereal, mature, poised, etc. teenage girl whose presence alone took everyone's breath away. Second, Richard Jury is still chasing and fantazing about his beautiful women friends/neighbor/acquaintance who happened to be all single and could be in love with him. Every men in this book is mature, yet they all seem to go gaga in regards to the teenage girl. I also did not like the sexual innuendos (very irritating and over used). Martha Grimes needs fresh materials. I hope her next book is not going to include anymore precocious kids, or older men in love with these kids..."
5,Unable to stop reading,"From the moment I started reading The Grave MauriceI was unable to put it down unless outside circumstancesforced me to. Martha Grimes has a way of writing about characters thatalways makes me care about them. I understand theadults because there is always some aspect of mein each one of them. And when she writes aboutchildren, it is a delight.It was wonderful to revisit with Jury and his friends.If I were a going to be a writer, I would studyall of Martha Grimes books. She has a way ofmaking all the things she describes a part of thestory. Not all details advance the story, but inher hands, the detail is always a part of the story.It is so easy to visualize what she is writing about.I highly recommend this book."
1,The Grave Mistake,"I have read most of Martha Grimes' books. The End of the Pier remains one of my all-time favorites. This offering, however, is pathetic. After the cliff-hanging end of the last Richard Jury book we find Jury alive and surprisingly well after being shot three times. He is, in fact, well enough to go to bed with one of the suspects, his injuries being no impediment to sexual prowess. There is kidnapping, horse-napping, rape, murder; comic relief provided by a hermit; the usual gang hanging out at the Jack and Hammer; and a bizarre connection to Premarin, the estrogen replacement pharmaceutical produced from pregnant mare's urine. The book does not hang together, is not well plotted, is difficult to follow, and is not worthy of Mz.Grimes usual workmanship."
3,Depressing,"I have been a fan of Jury and company since the start of this series, but when I turned the last page of this book, I only felt depressed. Even with the delightful schemes that Melrose undertakes to keep Agatha away from Ardry End I found that this is one book I will not keep on my book shelf."
2,Hold the Premarin !!!!,"This book, while dull, was eye opening about the abuse that the US's drug companies are allowed to get away with. In the book they were concerned about the horse's quality of life - but actually what are the drug companies doing to damage & destroy people's health in their quest for profit!?! Think about it."
2,"Quit Horsin' Around, Martha","Dan Ryder is supposedly a jockey comparable in stature to the great Lester Piggott. That being the case, the story of his race in France is totally absurd to anyone even vaguely familiar with jockeys, race horses and/or the racing world. Based on truly nonsensical assumptions,it destroys the author's credibility.As do many other equine howlers, such as the scene in which an untrained rider like Melrose easily mounts a champion race horse and simply jogs along. C'mon Martha,do your homework!"
3,Certainly Not the Strongest Grimes!,"I didnt' think this book was as bad as some of the other review stated, but it isn't Martha Grimes' strongest effort. I still enjoyed the story. The story was a little different since there was really no crime to solve at first, and when a murder did happen it wasn't integral to the story. Then somewhere about 2/3 of the way through the book, stuff starts happening, but again there is no real mystery, as there is no intended murder. Anyway, the book is still good because Ms. Grimes is such an accomplished author. I would have liked to see more hilarious antics of Melrose Plant and his eccentric Long Piddleton crew, but maybe next time."
2,This may be my last Martha Grimes book...,"The good news about this book is that it reunites us with Richard Jury and Melrose Plant. The bad news is that Martha Grimes can't figure out if she wants to write plausible forensic murder, implausible sensational murder, or drawing room comedy. I keep thinking I&#65533;m going to just give up on her and this time I just might. This one stretches the reader&#65533;s gullibility to extremes and although it makes a very good point about the horrible fate of the thousands of pregnant mares who supply the drug industry with their urine for hormone replacement therapy, she doesn&#65533;t give this choice story thread a chance. One of the things that I hate the most is going back and forth from serious murder mystery to the comedy of Long Piddlington, home of zany denizens and Melrose Plant. It is like she can&#65533;t decide which kind of story to write, so she writes both."
1,"Farfetched coincidences, don't you think?","Warning! Gives away plot!A young girl is kidnapped and raped and they let her have the run of the farm?She has the run of the farm and she doesn't run away immediately?I can barely accept Maurice believing that his dead(!) father needs to speak to Nell (why?) but after realizing Nell is kidnapped, why would he keep silent? He knows who talked to him!Jockeys on the wrong horse? His wife jumps at the chance to identify someone else as her dead husband? No one misses the real dead guy?And then it's a case of revenge from a character we barely know?Oh, dear, this one really strains the imagination.And after all that, Nell dies? The only thing that might have saved this book for me is if Nell ended up with Vernon.I love Martha Grimes and I have been happily wending my way through the Richard Jury novels, but this one I wish I had missed."
1,no more Martha,"I can't remember when I was more angry at the ending of a book. When I finished THE GRAVE MAURICE I swore that I would never read another Martha Grimes book, and so far I haven't. I admit I miss Richard Jury and Melrose Plant as I would any other old friends, but I am tired of endings that feel like a kick in the stomach! So, no more Martha. I will find new friends elsewhere."
2,Where was her editor?,"First let me say that I am a huge fan of Martha Grimes--both the Richard Jury mysteries and her other novels. I love the characters she has constructed in the Jury series. But this was just plain awful. The writing style could almost be described as meandering and disjointed--not good in a mystery with a complicated plot. There are passages that I have read over and over again, and about the meaning of which I still remain confused. I agree with other reviewers that while certain elements of the story --investments, horse racing, premarin production, etc.--were intriguing, they involved too many events that defied credibility. I also found it disturbing and incredible that every male in this novel seemed to be obsessed, sexually, with a seventeen year old female. All but one of these male characters was old enough to be her father or grandfather. It almost seems as if this was a first draft that needed re-working and polishing. Disappointing!"
1,one foot in the grave maurice,"The Grave Maurice begins with the solid fictional premise of love and denial in the extended family. But instead of developing any plot or characterization, Grimes relies on vaguely ridiculous humor that will be of interest only to dedicated fans. Brush away the stock characters and the initial conceit and all that is left is an artless ""tina and tom meet animal rights."""
2,More Fantasy than Mystery,"I was a big fan of Ms. Grimes' earlier works, but her last few Jury mysteries have been extremely disappointing. Again, she utilizes extremely chance meetings and far-fetched links amoung strangers to produce the mystery as well as solve it. She should also re-read her earlier books and reacquaint herself with her characters. In ""The Old Fox Deceived"", Melrose had backflashes about participating in a cubbing (pre-season hunt) as a 10-year-old and the trauma of having the fox's blood smeared on him as part of a bizarre ritual. In addition, in the 'Fox Deceived' story, he participated in a hunt -- galloping over fields and jumping ditches and fences -- during which a body was discovered. But, in ""The Grave Maurice"", he was portrayed as knowing nothing about fox-hunting nor about riding a horse. I think Martha is tired of her characters; maybe she should let them fade away gracefully."
2,Whoa Nellie!,"I've dipped in and out of the Richard Jury series over the years, and generally I've found Martha Grimes' books to be entertaining and well-written -- though not perfect. By contrast, ""Grave Maurice"" is gravely flawed. How in the world could the mere photograph of a 15-year-old girl, Nell Ryder, engender such intense feelings of yearning and passion in every grown man who sees it? When Nell appears in the flesh, she's described as lucent and luminous but actually seems one-dimensional in the extreme. Meanwhile, the plot is awash in coincidences that rob it of honesty. Face it: Melrose Plant is the one decent character -- give him his own series, Martha, and give handsome Richard Jury's bullet-riddled, bed-hopping body a little rest."
2,Mopey Maurice,"I was very disappointed in this latest (and apparently rushed to publish) installment by Ms. Grimes. Can't anyone be happy in her books anymore? Please, let Jury put himslef out of his misery and give Melrose a chance to shine. While the information on Premarin was interesting, there was no closure on that plot line other than the heroine coming to grief. I did like the way she portrayed the equine thoughts - that reminded me of the old Martha Grimes wit and why I so liked her earlier books.I have been such a fan of this series of mysteries but I have to say that I will wait until her next one is out in paperback and I find it used. I can't see paying good money for the hard cover version anymore.Did I find this hard to put down? Very, but mostly because I was hoping it would get a lot better."
1,Did Martha write this?,"I have read every book in the Richard Jury series, having come upon it by first buying the Blue Last. I found myself straying from reading this one on a number of occassions, unusual in that I typically read Martha's books in two days. Did Ms. Grimes actually write this book, or did she use a ghost writer? In either case, I am very disappointed."
3,Not as good as M. Grimes other books,This book was just okay. I have enjoyed her other Richard Jury books but this one dragged and really did not ever come together well.
2,Down Hill Slide,"A novel/mystery asks the reader to suspend belief. For THE GRAVE MAURICE by Martha Grimes maybe you'd best go out an bury it. The idea behind this one didn't have a chance of telling the reader any thing but that Jury surived the last book. Now I wonder if THE BLUE LAST was actually written as a closure to the series, but managed to get revived.Kidnapping, murder, jump racing, and Melrose Plant figure in this one.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
2,Not her best,"I have read all her books. Obviously, I love her writing. But I have real problems with this one. Two incredible plot contrivances and a horrific ending really spoiled this brew for me.Still, it's Martha Grimes, one of the best, most erudite mystery writers of our time. I guess everybody has to throw in a stinker from time to time."
2,A Grave Failure,"I love Martha Grimes I went straight out and bought this book and was so disappointed. The many plots drag and the usual characters are less than sprite. Even Melrose is lacking in his usual charm. And after leading the story for the first half of the book, she just drops and forgets about him. Jury who I have never found that charming makes his usual depressing mistakes. Jury has seen his day, it's time Melrose had his chance!!!"
3,A Puzzling Fun Book,"A Puzzle In A Pear Tree is a fun, quick read book. You can also skim it if you want to move faster. Cora Felton is a different kind of elderly amatuer detective who doesn't really construct cross word puzzles (her niece does them). She's been married numerous times, smokes cigeretts, drinks, and can be a wise guy. The plot is interesting . I rate this a B for crime novel.I would recommend it."
2,"good novel, dumb ending","99 Fear Street is a good series, and this is a good book, but the end of it is so incredibly stupid that I found myself disgusted with the whole thing. What I had a problem with was the reason the house was evil. It was ridiculous. I won't spoil it for you in case you want to read this book, which isn't bad except for the last few chapters."
3,It was an ok book,"i thought the book wasn't a bad book or a really good book. So i basically thought it was an average book. It wasn't that scary and horrifing. But there was a good story to it. It is about a girl who comes back to this haunted house to find the ghost of her dead sister that died a while back. But her sister causes all these accidents tha kills people. So if with a good story, but isn't that scary but with alot of surprises that wil surprise you then you should read this book."
5,the third horror(fear street: the house of evil),"I thought that this was a very interesting book. The reason I think that is because it was a real cliff hanger, and I don't know about you but I like cliff hangers. But if you haven't read the first two then the third one odes not make any sence at all. So my advise to every one who reads this review, make sure you read the first two before you read this one. Thank you for your time, and I hope you have this review will help you in the long run for picking out books. -Anonymous-"
2,The eyebrow,"This book doesn't give much support or detail of how you can obtain a beautiful eyebrow, although all the photographs are very nice and all. Not enough information to obtain best brow formula, choosing the right shape for your face. Very disappointed."
1,SAY NO TO THE DEATH MARCH - TAKE THE BUS!,"I was very impressed by Yourdan's commentary on software projects.However, the simplest strategies to avoid a death march were not discussed.This is why I must give this book a low rating.These are strategies which I find always work:#1 Find a fall guy to blame - junior staff work well.#2 Get promoted so your're not around#3 Obtain a transfer so you're out of there.#4 Legally change your name so you can deny emails (Like Bill Gates - 'I am Melindabill' )#5 Make committments but never sign or acknowledge memoranda#6 Blame the vendor#7 Blame it on the use of the chinese calendar#8 Plan a cover-up that makes Watergate look like a picnic#9 Hire a consultant and give them the stuff which makes your project impossible#10 Take lots of sick leave ONLY after you start wearing your Star Trek uniform with an aluminum hat stuttering 'I am a programmer Jim-not a doctor!'."
3,Average,"It is mostly a synopsis of ideas from several better books (e.g. Peopleware). I'd suggest reading them instead. Of course, the bibliography from this book is very useful. It is a decent guide to what resources are available for dealing with Death March projects."
5,Has this guy been following me....,"My boss gave me this book yesterday. Because of its title, it was intended as a joke about a ""death march"" project that finally died. Started reading it, and thought ""My god... This guy has been watching my career!!"" Unfortunately, the project mentioned is alive and suffering again today (The Death March project that won't die!!) With this book, I now have a renewed hope that I may survive it"
2,Death March Got Boring,"This is a reality check for those contemplating or embarking upon a death march. Evaluate the situation before making the decision to join a death march team. Consider the personal and professional sacrifices. The introduction is too long, I sat the book down several times.The book contains relavent information, and should be required reading for undregraduate and graduates, but perhaps a condensed version. Hopefully the students will have instructors that will assign section in order to cut down on the repetition."
5,"Look at the philosophy, not the technology.","Having managed several death march projects before I had even heard of this book, and now being involved in the mother of them all, there is a certain grim satisfaction in recognising one's situation in the title of a book.This is a book for project managers who are faced with the impossible. It prescribes no magic formulae, but assists the often stressed and over-worked PM's brain to calmly consider the symptoms of the current environment and even to admit a laugh or two about the absurdity of it all.As a project manager who has worked mostly in the web environment, I can safely say that the majority of web projects are death march projects - it all depends on the organisation whether they're Mission Impossible or Ugly.Much food for thought for web development projects, in my opinion, and the principles do not date at all."
4,Avoid the Death March,"Its funny reading the reviews which are posted here, esp. the one which says its a tad outdated. As if such reading was a fad. ""Dont read The Mythical Man Month. Its old and hence no longer true!"". Obviously these people have never been in big projects which have suffered from budget, schedule and/or resource deficiency.Although I concede this book does not give how-to-fix-it solutions, it covers in good detail how to recognise Death March projects and DO SOMETHING about them. This is not a book for juvenile programmers, but for project managers struggling to make their projects complete on time, within budget and with desired quality and who have experienced their projects slip schedules by several months, one-day-at-a-time."
1,Not worth your time to read this one.,"Save your money and your time with this software book. Some of his stories are interesting but in the author had nothing to add to what Steve McConnell put into his well researched book ""Rapid Development."" If you have already read RD there is no reason to read Death March."
3,Are Death Marches becoming the norm?,"Although Yourdon does present many useful techniques for dealing with a project that is at risk because of unreasonable scheduling or budget demands, I'm not willing to believe that ""death march"" projects need to be the norm. I find his opinion to be overly cynical and lacking in imagination. Perhaps its time for Mr. Yourdon to leave writing about software development to others that have not given up on the industry."
3,Good but not entirely convincing.,"There are more and more books coming out all the time on how to run your projects and, although the information given in here is good, there's not really anything here that you won't get elsewhere."
3,"Read It , But Use Your Own Judgement","Yaa, this book gives you a very real life understanding of projects, ""doomed to be failed"". If you have read this book, you can understand the likely next step in the fateful project. This book should be read once, but use your own judgement in tackling the situation, if unfortunately caught into Death March."
2,"Problem: Death March Project, Solution: Quite Your Job","1. This book has many grammatical mistakes.2. The same simple idea is usually repeated throught a chapter. The book actually could have been 1/3 thinner. Too much reading to unravel too few useful ideas.3. ""Quit the job"" is often cited as an effective way to deal with death march projects4. The last few chapters are simply out of touch with reality - using tools for complex modeling and analyzing the the ""soft"" factors (skill acquisition, morale, etc.) of software process and introducing common sense in finding the dysfuctions in an organization that unlikely to be changed. In my opinion, All these actually constitute the ""art"" of project management and are too simplistic to be subjected to these kind of logical analysis."
4,Great Book,Reading this book you will realize that it all relates to your experiences. I personally appreciate books that I can relate to and that are not just theoretical.This is a must read for all developers and their managers.Learn from experience - we (software engineers & managers) do not always re-invent the wheel.
5,I've survived several death marches...,Many organizations cannot survive Death Marches. Exceptions are the federal government and university hospitals. It's a pity that those most in need of this information are highly resistant to learning about the problem until it's too late. The innocent seldom go unpunished. The perpetrators are promoted. Example's of Putt's Law at work.mv
3,Accurate But Not Practical,"This book gives you a very real life understanding of projects. This is a book for project managers who are faced with the impossible. Death March projects seem to be the norm in the software industry. This book explains about how Death March Projects comes about, and how to survive it. While reading this book, I always found the examples given are very realistic. But this book does not offer solutions for people involved in Death March situations. There are no silver bullets here."
5,Just read the preface ... and fascinated,"One of my ""softworkers"" gave me Ed's book for a short preview. I could just read the preface ... and I was fascinated. It seems to be like DeMarco's/Lister's ""Peopleware"" and/or like Fred Brooks' ""The Mythical Man Month"". - So the very first thing I did, was to order this book and now I'm anxiously waiting for the delivery. But be sure: When I will have read the book, I will send you my comment. Although just 32, me and my ""softworkers"" are people, who know ""Death March Projects"" like good old friends. - See you."
4,Good reading on the problem but generic on a solution ..,"Yourdon's book is a great read on identifying Death March projects. The fact is that we have quite a few people who fail to realize (or do not want to admit) that they are in such a project. After all, knowing the problem is a good start to a solution.Yourdon does a nice job of examining the root causes through recent examples in the industry.I expected to see more pragmatic steps to handling such projects .. but the solutions are generic at best."
4,Not as good as I expected,"This is a good, quick read on an interesting toppic. A lot of relevant anecdotes from some experienced engineers, but it wasn't as useful as I hoped. Sometimes, quitting is not the answer! I was really hoping for a ""prescription."" There are enough useful tidbits and soundbites here to be worth the read, however, and it's a great introduction to other similar writings (many referenced within)."
2,Would be a great a white paper.,"This book contains some valuable information, howver it could easily be boiled down to 20 pages. When trying to keep up with the rapid changes in technology I don't have time for such verbose books."
1,Could have made it better...,"I was very disappointed when I opened the package. The bowls are made in China (other butterfly meadow sets are made in Indonesia). The white color does not match with the other butterfly meadow sets. The quality of white procelain is very poor. It looks cheap! However, I like the other sets I bought (18-peice dinnerware). They are beautiful."
4,Simple and Fun,"This book came in a set of the other 3 Baby Dazzlers titles. My 2 year old loves the simple and enthusiastic rhymes, bright colors, and glittery accents on every page. Each book has a baby with a different skin color, which is always nice! Children's book of the month club offers all four books in a set for really cheap! I recommend all four"
1,Not worth the money,Limited narration... just a barrage of disconnected scenes from Spain. This video provides little to orient the student or traveller. A disappointment.
2,Living and Working in Canada,"This book was not very helpful if you are moving from the US, probably more helpful for someone moving from, say Europe. There wasn't anything in this book that I hadn't already found by quick searches on the internet. I was hoping for more specific and detailed info."
1,Much Ado about Nothing,"This is a slick packaged book for sure, but author Art Scheck is plainly not a long time rod builder. This book seems to have been written by someone with little to no actual rod building experience. He expounds for page after page on things that have no bearing on actual rod building. His use of old fashioned and outdated guide spacing charts shows that he knows little of modern rod building methods. He used several hundred pages for information that could have been well covered in just 50. I've been building rods for 30 years and have kept up to date. I really think Art's book shows that he was not yet at the level of knowledge he needed to be at to write such a book.Save your money, keep looking, There are many rod building books out there much, much, much better than this one."
2,Written by a high schooler?,"I have recently discovered that some of my ancestors were German immigrants who settled, for a while, in Pennsylvania, so I wanted to know a little more about what their experiences might have been like. This book (which I have not yet bothered to finish) has not been helpful in the least. It reads like a report written for a high school history class--one that maybe got a C."
3,Okay but better stuff available,This is a decent enough book for a beginning unicycler. Photographs would have been preferable over the drawings for illustration and I would have liked to seen it a bit more comprehensive.
2,Rings don't stay shut,"I don't know if this is an issue because the binder is a lasrge 3 inches, but the rings misaligned after using it a couple of times. Now when I leaf through the binder, I am constantley having to open it up to return the sheet protectors to thier proper ring. Very frustrating and a waste of my time."
5,outlawz duo rap great,this is a very excellent album...i didnt have this one cuz they didnt carry it at the big stores but i am so glad i found it at amazon cuz it is a lost treasure if u dont have it... i strongly recommend this album if you are a true OUTLAW fan.
3,Good Gift,"If you need a little something for a friend, this is the book.Nice ME illustrations.Seems a little small- wish it had more pictures."
5,MY BODY,Awesome little book for children to get the idea of how their body is put together on the inside. Kids LOVE assembling themselves. This is a great book and a good buy for the classroom teacher.
2,No matter how desperate you are to return to Amber...,"...don't follow this road through Shadow. Contrary to the popular thought, all roads do NOT lead to Amber. This one leads to the slush pile. Or should have.Really, THIS is why RZ didn't want anyone else writing Amber stories (although, to be fair, I think there are a couple of writers out there who could possibly give it a whirl and be decent). Awful.Maybe if RZ hadn't been such a brilliant writer, and such a poet, it would have been passable. For sure there's a lot of :meh: pop mm pb fiction out there that Betancourt's series could have gotten lost in. There are worse books out there. But he's taking someone else's world and turning it into wood.If you really enjoy Amber, go read it again (or at least just Corwin's chronicles). Or go pick up something else by RZ...This Immortal, Jack of Shadows, even A Night in the Lonesome October. But avoid this."
4,It's not corwin. But...,"It will do. At first i thought i was reading ""Nine Princes"" again right toCorwin having ammesia. Forturnately, I don't think the story os going to go that way. Although I do think that this version of Oberon is a Corwin clone."
3,I read this years ago when it first came out,"I would buy this for the Kindle if all of them were out for the Kindle. I'd like to re-read these and then read the 10 Amber novels again as well, but only 1 of the Betancourt ones being on Kindle is a deal breaker for me.Why aren't all 3 available on the Kindle!?"
1,What child abusers want you to think...,"This book is horrendous. There is not one speck of truth in it. First off, I was expecting a book, not a homemade pamphlet that is way over priced. These people got their children taken away because they couldn't care for them. Her lack of supervision and drug abuse got her children taken away not the so called ""child snatchers"" on a mission to take innocent children from innocent parents. These parents are ""surprised"" when CPS is at thier door they should expect it. If you can't raise your kids in a manner that is not detrimental to their health and safety you shouldn't have them! Do yourself a favor and read the author's website instead!"
3,Low revolutions?,"In the short samples to listen, why this recording is heard with slow speed revolutions than normal?.I have the original vinyl English recording and no wonder sound and revolutions are at normal speed, even the two on one C.D under the Vocalion brand seal recording, the sound and speed revolutions are normal as original recording.No wonder this C.D is so cheap and I seriously doubt about quality."
1,This book sucks,"This guy obviously didn't listen to any inner truth, because it wouldn't tell him to participate in a reckless exploitation of the beautiful Peace Pilgrim. Peace Pilgrim II sounds like a joke, but unfortunately he's not. Certainly this man is well-meaning and even peaceful, but he's misguided and then wrote a bad book about it."
4,The Horten Brothers and their All-Wing Aircraft,"Fascinating story of an amazing family, determination , terrific aviation adventures and the hardships, trials and tribulations associated with cutting edge aviation experimentation. Packed with original photographs. Well worth having in your library if interested in the Horten flying wings."
3,Very good for the Price but quality control needed,"This is a real bargain. Nice looking. The only problem is that the first table was delivered with damages to the frame because it is not packed for shipment, and the second table had spots and a crease on the cover. THE company STOOD BY THEIR PRODUCT and sent new ones. I had to get rid of the old ones because it would be too expensiv to return them (I gave one to a friend and put a ""Free"" sign the other, and it was picked up within an hour)."
1,TABLE ARRIVED BROKEN,"THE TABLE ARRIVED WITH SEVERAL PIECES OF THE MAIN SUPPORT FRAME BROKEN OFF, THERE IS ANOTHER REVIEW OF THIS TABLE WHICH DESCRIBES THE SAME THING, I AM RETURNING THE TABLE."
5,Must Read Book,"This book was a gift for my birthday. I highly recommend it to anyone (right or left) who is interested in public policy and specifically, foreign policy. This is a must read book."
4,Hard to finish,"Insightful. Long. Detailed. For me an interesting history of the intertwining of lives. Eventually the detail was a just a little too much for me so I started to skim. Still, worth the read."
3,There're ok,"Not the best quality. The holes where the rings are inserted are very thin. I turn them through the rings very slowly so not to tear them.However, Amazon had the best price by far. Yea Amazon!!There is a God and He loves you!Joh 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.Joh 3:17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved."
1,A good listen spoiled.,"I find this album so poorly recorded as to be unlistenable. The miking is so close that we hear every grunt, moan and wheeze. There is a constant clacking as Bruno hammers on the finger board. Since the fingers are positioned ahead of playing the note, this noise is out of time with the music and so loud, it is impossible to ignore.Bruno should have his knuckles rapped with a bow!The hall has so much reverbertion, it sounds like the subway. Perhaps that is why it is miked too close.What could have been a fine performance is obscured by several inexcusable and inexplicable production choices.I bought this CD to hear Bach's music, not Mr. Bruno's bodily functions. What sort of ego presumes otherwise.This recording is an insult to the music and the listener."
2,Poor book if you are not an expert in mythology,"If you are not educated in mythology and the like, skip this book. I thought it would describe the history of the Inca Empire and mention mythology while doing so, but this book is MAINLY about the mythology itself. Only for experts in the field if you ask me, not for the general public. Written in a boring style."
1,One of the worst books ever written,"If you want to know something about the Incas, forget this book. He spends time on the Aztecs, the Greeks even the Romans, but other than spelling out Inca words with no translation for them, forget it.There are extensive endnotes, some that last more than a page which are equally obscure. The author is very insistent about never getting to the point and avoiding logical conclusions.If you have insomnia, you might want to invest in this waste of space."
1,Unabashed confusion,This book had no depth was irritating to read. It was like reading rambling gossip. The timeline changes and new characters abound then disappear.I have read Maloufs' Ranson and An imaginary Life and both were excellent. This was like reading another author.
1,"Just one, not two filters","The humidifier needs two filters, I dont know where is the other one. I only received one. One is useless"
4,Good filters,"These were a very good price for these kind of filters. Whatever you purchase, be sure to check out the cost of the replacement wicks. These were the best prices I could find so would certainly recommend this seller! Just wish the manufacturer sold them in larger/discount quantities."
1,Ripped off AGAIN!!!,Like others before... ordered the one with diamonds around the bezel and got the cheaper one without. Looks like Amazon found a great way to increase profits!
2,Not the watch I payed for!,"I read the other reviews before it happened to me. That people had ordered the diamond bezel and face omega and received the cheeper version. I could not believe it would happen again after these complaints but it did!!!!I opened the box to find the wrong omega in the right box!!! What is happening to quality control? Is their a thief in their warehouse? What ever, I will not be using Amazon again!!!!! They are losing a very good customer..."
4,Arrived quickly,Good value for the price. We need a lot of pens that will be used simultaneously for a school rummage sale.
3,Boring,"Mallory talked to people more, and people talked to her more, when she was dead than alive. Same questions to Mallory from Rachel, over and over again. ""What do you want from me Mallory?"" ""You're still here aren't you Mallory?"" ""What are you trying to tell me Mallory?""Kyle was focused on Rachel's breasts. He was always thinking about them, talking about them, staring at them or touching them.Then there were the inconsistencies.Kyle takes a cold shower but the bathroom is steamed.Rachel ""removed her long scarf and threw it into the driver's seat with enough force to show her anger."" We're talking a scarf here, which would be more likely to float.Repetitious: ""He gave her a concerned look and said `We're concerned about you.'""In one short paragraph; ""get to him"", ""he was getting to her"", ""get what she wanted"".This book wasn't horrible, it just wasn't very good."
5,the charlie daniels band the collection,"i got very lucky to find this collection. i was looking for 1 cd out of this collection and it was impossible to find alone! and the asking price was over 100.00 dollars. after finding this collection, i found that 1 of the others is also very hard to find and just as expensive as the 1st. i got 3 cds for less than i ever expected. i'm so very happy to have found it on Amazon, and at a great price too!"
5,Three-CD Collection From Pro-Law-Enforcement Country-Rock Fiddler-Guitarist-Singer-Bandleader,"THE COLLECTION is a three-CD set consisting of pro-law-enforcement country-rock fiddler-guitarist-singer-bandleader Charlie Daniels' three biggest-selling albums- FIRE ON THE MOUNTAIN, MILLION MILE REFLECTIONS, and FULL MOON. Each is exceptional in its own way, with FIRE ON THE MOUNTAIN being the best, with its anthemic shuffle ""The South's Gonna Do It Again"" giving the southern states a rallying cry that still thrills fans from 8 to 80. The fact that, at the 2002 peak of anarchist alternative rock, Daniels, along with Outlaws members Hughie Thomasson (RIP) and Henry Paul, Marshall Tucker Band members Doug Gray and Chris Hicks, and Sammy Hagar, expressed support for police use of aggressive force to rescue two girls who'd survived a horrific kidnapping in California makes this set an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
5,"I love this product, but I don't use it alone","I really do love this product. It is too expensive to use alone, in my opinion. I mix a little in my hand with the more affordable Fantasia IC Straightening serum and it works wonders. The combo works much better than either does alone. I apply it to my wet hair, allow it to airdry and then flat-iron."
1,Expensive for something that doesn't work!,"Sure the product made my hair ""smooth"", but it wasn't super silky smooth. The product has a wierd smell, not too happy when I have it on my hair. This doesn't help with frizzy hair, even if you used it with the CHI ceramic flat iron.I wouldn't recommend this product, unless you want to spend $19 with a $6 order to have free shipping!"
3,Buyers better have their ducks in a row-compatability issues,"Roku's Soundbridge units don't work with all routers, so before you think wireless music is within your sites, do your homework. To Roku's credit, they offer a list of, and rate compatability factors for, most of the common routers consumers are using at home. CHECK THIS LIST CAREFULLY before you buy this product or you might end up with some expensive audio equipment that only works if you go WIRED. Also, Roku has a nice discussion board forum on their site, and you can get a realistic idea about issues concerning the pros and cons of their products. If you do buy something that doesn't work, they do offer a 30 day-no-questions-asked return policy. Bottom line is CHECK OUT THEIR SITE b4 u buy anywhere else. [...]"
4,Love it except for a few exceptions,Finally bought after several weeks on research. It works well; easy to connect to ITunes and Rhapsody (my two favorite music servers).Just a few notes1) The manual is a bit hard to follow - especially concerning wireless connectivity.2) Will not stream Itune files ripped using Apple lossless - really big deal for me since I use lossless as my default.3) 802.11b instead of g - no big deal to me; my network performance is mostly gated by the speed of my DSL connection.The biggest problem is setting it up. If all works well when you first plug it in - great. Else be prepared to search through the tech support documents and the user forums.
4,"Good Read and Historical Fiction, Too","Mr. Tracy stated that most of the events in the novel happened either to himself or to people he knew. If it isn't eloquent, it has plenty of action and setting to make up for it. One needs to remember that the law wasn't always nearby and was at time administered unfairly or arbitrarily. Most of the characters are two-dimensional, but their participation in the plot does not require more than that. The protagonist and his friends have more complex lives and histories. A very satisfying and educational read."
4,Same but not,"This cooler was a replacement for one that I currently have on my offroad car as an engine oil cooler, The cooler works good, but as a direct replacement the size and hole placement was a little different. I was able to make minor adjustments without re-welding the mounting bracket, but this would've been difficult if this was to be change in the desert with only hand tools."
3,Not as strong as the 1/2 NPT ports would make you think..,"This thing is weak. I had one crack on me, when used as an oil cooler with -12 hoses. The cooler cracked around one of the connection bosses. Dang near lost an engine. My welder says it is too thin to weld.Anyone using larger hoses should be sure absolutely no stress at all is transferred to the cooler bottom plate. It is not up to the job, and will grow brittle with stress or vibration and crack.It does work fine as a transmission cooler, where the lines are much smaller and lighter and more flexible."
3,Women in Ancient Greece,"I had to buy this book for a Gender and Society in Ancient Greece. It is an interesting read. I believe the author gets offended too easily at the treatment of women without taking into consideration the time period. In doing so she does not give enough credit to the positive impact that women in Ancient Greece had, even though their rights were extremely limited."
2,"Doesn't come ""complete""...","Although the picture, manual, and product description indicates that this item comes with a dc-connector for your car (via a cigarette lighter)... my unit came with 2 bare wires. When I inquired, they said I should ""hard-wire"" the unit to the car battery.This is a lot of money to spend on something that you have to modify to use it.I would avoid...(I wish someone would have warned me.)"
4,"If you enjoyed the movie, you'll enjoy the book!","Though I like the movie better, I really enjoyed this book. I recommend it for anyone who liked the film. It has the same humor."
3,I LOVED this movie..less so the book,"I loved the movie Sideways. I can't say the same for the book. I found the writing too artifically wordy (as if the author wrote with a thesaurus by his side). Sure, the character of Miles is a writer and supposedly very intelligent, but, come on, who really talks like that? Too Webster for me, as Jack would say. I also didn't find the information about the wine as well done as I saw in the movie."
2,The movie is much better,"This is one of those rare instances where the book is not better than the movie. It's difficult and often unfair to compare a book and a movie, but in this case the movie really flushes out what the book could have been. Mr. Pickett would have been well served with a better editor and a tighter story. The wine talk wears pretty thin pretty fast and takes about 200 pages to accomplish what the movie did in the first forty minutes."
3,How could the movie really be topped anyway?,"I agree with those who say the film was superior to the novel. There's no quantifying the chemistry and humanity that Paul Giamatti and Thomas Hayden Church brought to the roles. Much of the humor of the film seems sucked away in the novel and we are left largely with a travelogue of wine country. I don't regret reading the novel, however, and I would be quick to pick up anything else Pickett cares to write. My sense is that he is probably aware of the comparisons and has taken them to heart. I look forward to the future for this guy."
4,As Good As The Movie,"The novel Sideways is different enough from the movie to be well worth reading. I loved it; however, when I found out how the publisher had cheated Rex Pickett, I was disappointed."
3,typing errors?,"The actual story was fine, similar to the film, however the Kindle version of this book is so full of misspellings and grammatical errors (paragraphing, punctuation, etc.) that it is very difficult to follow if you don't already know the story. I don't know if these errors are exclusive to this edition or if the standard book contains them as well. If so, the editors should be horse-whipped."
4,"Fast shipping, good product. Would buy from them again.","Fast shipping, good product. Would buy from them again. Received international shipping to NZ that arrived much sooner than projected."
4,puschi,"A fun easy read. A bit pretentious at times with all the wine ya-ya. The guys are such ""hens"" with their alternate fits of pouting. A great escape for a couple of nights reading. Not much work except for the occasional ""hard"" word to look up; thus enhancing it's credibilty some. My favorite new word to roll off my tongue ""pusillanimous""."
5,A pleasant surprise.,"As a culinary school graduate and self described wine snob and foodie; I'm always intrigued when people can combine food and literature and I was not disappointed. The characters were likable and believeable despite their many shortcomings. An easy read which was good; since I was in the middle of planning a wedding myself and I just needed a quick read to take my mind off of all the drama. Definitely the male version of chick lit, I can't wait to see the movie."
4,A good read,"The little road-trip book about two rather unlikable characters (but sympathetic) is an enjoyable read. I really like Pickett's voice and his style. The dialogue and the characters are funny. The plot does get repetitive after a while and he does let his narrator (a writer) get into self-indulgence. And I have to say, the movie was better. Still, Pickett's first novel offers a glimpse to the human heart with a unique, fun journey."
2,"""surfer girl"", are you kidding me?","OK, sure, this is a mildly amusing novel, but it made you cry? Wow. Those waves have gone to your head, babe. Had it not been for Alexander Payne, this novel would never had made it to the shelves. It's not bad, but not that great either. Unless you are a huge Payne fan and want to see how he translates narrative to the screen, save your ten bucks for the movie!"
4,Great fun to read,There are some negative reviews listed here. Don't pay attention to them. This book is a lot of fun. I saw the movie first and decided to read the book. There are some plot changes in the book which definitely make it worth reading after watching the movie.
1,Boring,"This book was so dull I couldn't finish it. All it's basically about is 2 guys who talk and drink wine. They are alcoholics if they need to drink that much. Also I don't feel it's right to promote drinking and driving.I haven't seen the movie based on this book, but wonder if it's as bad."
3,Amazon description left room for improvement,"I purchased this ThermaRest/Trekker Lounge Chair for my daughters Christmas gift. I am very rarely disappointed with my Amazon purchases, but this time I was. The item should have been called a Thermarest Trekker/Camp Lounge Chair KIT as it is @ REI. I did not realize that I was only buying a sleeve that covers a ground pad that is not included. Neither the picture nor the name indicate that. Granted, I should have read deeper into the description. But, Amazon could have been more straightforward. Lesson learned. Now, we still have to get the pad - but I am not sure where that will be purchased."
1,Absolute Home Fails to deliver,"I had ordered a air purifier UV light from Absolute Home on April 26, 2006. They were quick to get their money from my account but after 2 months of not recieving my order I called them up and was assured I would recieve my order Within a month. Now it is July and ONCE again I will have to call to see what excuse they offer for not sending out my order. I would recommend that people find another place to do buisness.S.K."
5,What a pleasant surprise!,"I bought this book used and quite honestly figured that it would a New Agey type of book for spells. It was cheaply priced so I thought, ""What the heck? Might as well."" I was very pleasantly surprised at the research that went into gathering these spells. There are many authentic Hoodoo spells, and others from other traditions. They are excellently categorized. The book offers both a Table of Contents and an Index. Excellent choice. This is a book that all those working with folk magic should have."
5,scary,This book is wonderful. It has great recipes for natural healings which is what is out now. Don't be afraid it is s great book. Quick delivery by seller.
4,"Great spellbook to use in conjunction with folk magic and hoodoo, but some...","When I first bought this book, I was amazed at the amount of great research and diversity to be found. 97% of these spells are very good and effective, but the 3% left are just plain silly and stupid.(Look at the end of the love spells section.)Also, many of the ingredients listed in the book may be hard to make and procure, but just visit the lucky mojo curio company for many of these things.Great book, even if some of these spells are just flat out silly."
5,every working witch should own one of these,Yes this book is the one to own if your in need of huge referance book superb work by the author ! i enourage everyone to purchase a copy of this title
4,Great resource,I was extremely impressed by the shipper who got it to me FAST. After getting it open and paging through it seemed to be just what a lot of the other reviewers were saying about being a great reference book. I spent hours just pouring through it absorbing its information. Great buy to keep in library - highly recommend.
2,Egh....,This book was not what I expected.I was disappointed.Almost every story seems basically the same as the ones before.Would NOT recommend.
4,History written by a Congolese,"This book is great because it offers the best information you can find on the internal resistance against colonial rule, on the mobutu dictatorship and on the Conférence Nationale Souveraine (beginning of the 90s). The very extensive descriptions of the changing classes in the Congolese society are somewhat boring. And the book poorly describes what happens after 97.Ntalaja's english is easy reading for non-native speakers like myself ;-)"
5,Best Show Ever,"I was ten when this show came out, and all I have to say is that to this day, no show has come close to being as great as this. I would bargain with my father to let me stay up and watch all of Snick to make sure I wouldn't miss Are You Afraid of the Dark. I just bought the DVD of 91 episodes on E-Bay, and I am in heaven all over again. I get flooded with memories of old commercials, and the way life was. This makes my heart ache with a longing for my childhood, but I am so grateful for the oppurtunity to experience this again. I remember Halloween being so awesome because they would show more than one episode a night! I also just picked up Salute Your Shorts from E Bay. If you're reading this, then you probably remember that too. God how I miss those days..."
1,What's with the lines? Why?,I thought that the picture on-line was bad. I figured the shirt would be better in person - it wasn't. You can't tell that it's supposed to be a Phoenix Suns shirt. I was dissapointed.
4,Good for self-study,"I recommend this set. I used it to prepare the exam and I got just 2 incorrect answers of 65. The ""ICND"" book is quite good to introduce you on the basics of the cisco platform. The ""CCNA Exam Certification Guide"" is good to fill gaps in your knowlwdge, it's full of examples and practice questions (but it has errors too). It's CD-ROM has 200+ questions for exam simulation (several errors in the questions/answers) The third book (Internetworking Technologies Handbook) is one of the most complete references I've ever seen. It covers almost all the topics on networking. Worth to buy if you wan to prepare yourself for the exam."
1,Good idea - terrible execution,One of them came pre-dried out. 2 others won't retract all the way after the first use - so it'll just be a matter of time before they dry out as well. There's no way to get inside the mechanism to force it to shut all the way to prevent this from happening. All in all I'm not impressed with this product at all.
5,She never stops amazing you,"This most recent CD reveals that Barbara Cook's interpretive powers have only grown: how could you not be moved by ""Something's Coming"" from West Side Story, with a wonderful combination of Bernstein's upbeat tempo and some lovely, reflective moments. With Sondheim's ""No One is Alone"" and ""No More"" from ""Into the Woods"" and some pieces from ""Passion, a little Rogers and Hammerstein and finally ending up with ""Make our Garden Grow"" from Bernstein's ""Candide,"" fans of Cook's miraculous artistry are in for a never-too-soon fix. Those of you who love musical theatre and don't know this glorious treasure have a huge treat in store. Don't wait. Push that button now!"
3,Barbara still going strong,The voice is still beautiful but unfortunately so many of the songs have already been recorded by her. Why not new material? Also there is just a small combo to back her up when she always sounds so much better with a full orchestra. Barbara - you are alone on this album - why didn't you invite some more friends to record with you?
3,"Right Voice, Wrong Setting","I've loved Barbara Cook since forever. But, I was disappointed with this CD. Her intrepretation of the songs is simply flat. But I'm convinced it's because she wasn't in front of a live audience. When she is, she comes alive. And, at 80, that's some life!"
1,NOT AS DESCRIBED,"I bought a book, Sam Walton: Made in America. A back cover is torn and it is not as described."
1,I am disgusted by this book.,"I am really disgusted reading this book. The Walton family should go back and read their father's/grandfather's book and then be forced to work 10 days in the sweatshops that produce the goods that are sold at their stores since they are all so ""hard working"" and ""know the value of a dollar"". Thankfully I didn't buy this book my parents owned it so I thought I would read it. It's really sad to see how Sam Walton put local stores out of business by being ""competitive""."
1,"Sam Walton the Tyrant, Is More Like It.","This book is so bad, it's almost not even worth writing about. The book proports to shine some sunny light on the man solely responisble for making minimum wage and ""full time"" work (often defined as 20-30 hours) popular in keeping lower-class America in its place. Look no further for an account of the man focused on plumbing the depths of the dark heart of corporate greed. You'd be better off reading Barbara Ehrenreich's book, Nickel and Dimed."
1,Made in the USA?,"Does anybody remember the ""promise"" Wal-Mart made on commercials to buy ""American Made"" products and offer them for sale whenever possible? How long did that last? 6 months?? Now...Sam Walton's company is the largest retailer of products ""Made in China"". Would he be proud if he were still alive? Probably not."
1,Walmart - MADE IN AMERICA? Nothing Walmart Sells Is made in America!,"What gall to name a Walmart biography ""made in America"" when virtually everything you sell is NOT made in the USA! What we need are books about how to survive Walmart type business models! Our current horrible economy is an example of what happens when everything is outsourced. I think this type of biography simply shows how unpatriotic people can ruin a country. I hope we survive this anti MADE-IN-THE-USA philosophy."
4,You feel as if Grandpa was talking to you.,"Despite my hesitation at picking up an autobiography, I must say Made in America turned out to be quite a pleasant surprise. In it, Sam intersperses story telling with quotes from his colleagues, family and the media. After reading the story, you get a very clear picture of Sam's humble beginnings as a local boy who delivered papers, a boyscout who saved a person's life, a variety store franchise owner who was driven out of town because his lease expired and he didn't know that it was part of the contract he signed. In it you also learn what the Walmart Way was about. It's about hard work, passion for the job and thoughtful spending.He completed it just before he died of cancer. And a good thing he did because nobody can tell the story better than the person who's lived it."
4,american retailer,"l wanted to read this to get a better insight of where and how Wal-Mart came to be.l found this book to be very interesting,Sam Walton was born at the right time and place to create Wal-Mart. He considered himself a common man with the American work ethic - work hard and you will be rewarded. The backstory of his family life filled in the gaps and helps explain his persona. Anyone who decides to go into business for themselves or for any company should read this book."
2,Seems an odd title,"I have not read this book and know little about Walmart, but the title alone strikes me as odd. If one goes in a Walmart, a very large proportion of their products are made in China, not the USA. In fact, China's great surge in per capita is largely attributable to factory work cranking out huge amounts of cheap products for Americans. A lot of this is sold at Walmart, and goes back to a trend started by Sam Walton to move production away from the USA.If China was to consider embracing religion again, I would almost think that they might give serious consideration towards making Sam Walton their patron saint.Anyways, just seems an odd title."
5,a true American,I loved this book about Sam Walton. I recommend it to others. That's about all I have to say about it. Get it and enjoy!
4,American Hero,"I had read this book sometime back. I was doing a school project on Leaders and I could not think of anybody else than Sam Walton. Sam Walton revolutionized how the retail business is done. Though he was part of the billionaire list, he led a simple life and advised against huge pay for CEO's. You get to see his leadership model here and his winning spirits. I would advise everyone read the book and apply the principles from this book."
4,Great Book!,"This is a very strong story of a man and a business. Walton does a nice job of telling a clear, concise story about how he built the business of Wal-Mart. ""The Wal-Mart"" Way by Don Soderquist is another great book where the Former Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer talks about his success."
1,Made in countries with no human rights,"I stumbled upon this book after searching for goods made in the USA. I have not read it but believe in my feelings about Walmart. This corporation has undoubtedly taken over the planet. The only positive aspect is for their stockholders. The Walton families empire has been created by hurting people. Do your research on Walmarts personal factories in Asia and South America and the sick, sad conditions that we as shoppers are supporting. This mega monopoly has killed America's cities and towns with our admiration. Please stop supporting slavery in countries that have little to no human rights protections. We must challenge ourselves to buy American made goods, for the good of our own communities and the good of women and children who seem to be born to work 16 hour days in factories overseas. I wish Walmart would go away and open the door for small business to come back. Its not just Walmart either..."
4,A good summary of the area,"This book is probably exactly what you'd expect in a short book about Lake Mead. It's a good summary, and although slightly starstruck by the rightness of building Hoover Dam--""How, wondered Mrs D.L. Carmody, could mere man ever attempt to master the 'strange mountains, that oily river, those masses of black rock, those deep cravasses...that overwhelming fortress built by nature?'""--it's refreshing just for being an account of Lake Mead and not of Lake Powell, Lake Mead's much more celebrated ""sister lake.""Scholars of Glen Canyon and Lake Powell should read this just to better familiarize themselves with this dam and this reservoir that were such precedents for the dams and reservoirs to follow. Scholars of Lake Mead...have probably read it already."
4,A considerable upgrade over the 2nd edition.,"The photos and topos have been upgraded in the 3rd edition and they make it easier to find your way around. Many of the new photos are aerial shots and give excellent perspective. Much of the rest of the book is better too, with more background and better photos of climbers on the routes."
5,Great DVD!,"recommend this to anyone who likes The 69 Eyes or gothic music with a good message. Very clear, sound and picture, entertaining."
1,a August 2011 ordered copy STILL DOES NOT WORK,I ordered this DVD for a friend who is a fan of the 69 eyes. The day after I handed her the DVD she called me (august 2011) and told me that the DVD does not work in either of her 2 DVD players. She gave it back to me and I tried it in my Laptop where it also does not work. Reading the reviews after the fact this seems to be a problem that has been occoring since the DVD was released in 2006.I contacted Amazon about the problem by e-mail and received a very fast response and refund.A note to Amazon to maybe not sell the obviously defective item any more.KarinaThe 69 Eyes: Helsinki Vampires
5,Nice,"Quality is better than quantity. I love to hear that ""Bring it on"" and ""My Lover's Prayer""(duet with Robin Gibb)."
1,THIS IS TERRIBLE!!!!!,THESE PEOPLE KNOW ABSOLUTLY NOTHING ABOUT HORSES AND I SHOULD KNOW I OWN A HORSE RACING STABLE AND THE CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF THE LITTLE GIRLS AND HOW THE OWNER RUNS THAT PLACE IS NOT AT ALL REAL. THE NEXT TIME AN AUTHOR WRITES A BOOK THEY SHOULD DO SOME RESEARCH BEFORE HAND!!!!!!!!!!
3,very thin plastic biohazard bags,"These bags are very thin and transparent with a slight pink coloring when opened up. They are good if you want to see the actual contents of the bag, which might be important if you wanted to keep your different kinds of biohazardous waste sorted out. The bags are relatively small (2ft x 2ft) so they wouldn't hold more than a gallon or so of hazardous waste before becoming quite unsafe storage. Actually, I wouldn't try to put a gallon of waste in one of these bags, as I don't think the bag would hold that much weight without splitting--then you've got infectious waste just all over everything. Enjoy!!"
3,Different sound,"First off, I want to say I love Greg Brown's music. He's an icon in the music business. So it saddened me to listen to this disc and find a pop sounding; and dated I might add, cd. Sure the lyrics are good; they always are with Greg, but the music itself is commercial sounding. I was dissapointed, but not to fear, Mr. Brown has bounced back very nicely with some great ""Folkie"" releases since then. If you prefer his folk/roots sounding music, you might want to stay clear of this one."
3,"This album lacks Greg Brown's traditional ""folkiness"".","As a devoted fan, I feel that ""One Big Town"" was a difficult step in the wrong direction for singer/songwriter Greg Brown. Please don't misunderstand me - each song has originality and potential. However, if you like Greg Brown's general mixture of folk music with a touch of gospel, this is not his best release. The songs are a bit too jazzy for my taste."

1,disapointed,"Please note that this product was purchased from Amazon.com LLC as the seller. The product itself may be a good product, but the condition I received mine in can only be described as pathetic. The shipping box has definitely been abused, but usually items are packaged well to help prevent damage. In this case, the top, dome part of the can had a dent, which there were no apparent breaks in the box were in that location. The part of the can where the sides connect to the dome has paint chipping off and the can is rusting. It is rusting so bad that there is rust powder all around that part of the can. There was even rust powder in the box. At first I thought it was just dirt until I took a closer look. I am completely disappointed and immediately put in a return request just minutes after receiving it."
1,Glasses too big for head - too much mirror for normal viewing,Did not care for any of the sunglasses - know the price was very inexpensive - but thought I would still be able to use them as extras. They are definitely not worth even the $9 I paid including shipping - probably will end up in the trash.
2,could've spent $ on something better,I got this for my son for christmas and it worked well for a hour or two. Then the scoreboard stopped working and the reset button would'nt work. You also had to mess with the connections on the back to get contact. Just wasnt worth the money.
2,Did not last long at all,Normally Orbee toys last a lot longer for us but this was being chewed into pieces within an hour. I do have an aggressive chewer and Orbee brand is one of the few I've found that lasted. This particular one is just not as good as the other toys I have purchased.
3,She loved it to bits!,"This toy brought great pleasure, for a very short time. It was a big hit as a gift, but was shredded rather quickly."
1,not worth it!,My golden destroyed this toy within an hour! She was not playing ruff with it yet it came apart. I lOVE Planet Dog toys but this one was a disappointment.
1,The toy is absolutely terrible,My dog does not usually rip up toys but this bulb toy lasted about 3 minutes. The gray base is incredibly soft and comes apart in pieces easily. Do not waste your money on this cheap gimmick.
1,Orbee Tuff Lil Bulb Dog toy,I never received it and I do not want them anymore. I never received credit for not getting them.
3,Pup Christmas,"Love Planet Dog and the great Christmas idea; however, this was chewed up by my Chessie. She ripped the base grey portion fairly quickly.That said Planet Dog has a great return policy. Try it, if it doesn't work for your pup, they have a great return policy."
1,"Review of Planet Dog ""Lil Bulb"" (holiday theme)","Typically, the dog toys by Planet Dog are excellent and durably made. However, in the case of this ""light bulb"" toy, my Cavalier puppy chewed the base off within less than 30 minutes. The small rubber piece which came off was potentially dangerous for the dog, if it were ingested. Although service on this item was fine, I do not recommend this dog toy for any dog."
2,Fozzie,"It's cute, but our dog chewed the end off in less than 15 minutes. We have had other products by the same company that were MUCH more durable. Disappointing."
4,A good book to put in your library,"Although not my favorite cat breed book, it is quite informative and has great pictures, even if they are small. I like ""Legacy of the Cat"" better but buy this one anyway."
5,excellent technical dictionary,"The Harper Collins Concise Dictionary series is excellent. We ordered both the French and German for business & technical use. The range of word inclusion is superior. I see that these are now out of print. Too bad. They are a great resource. You can't always find the word you are looking for, searching online. You cannot underestimate the browse factor of a book vs specific online searches. The books themselves are lightweight and have great ""hand."" Easy to carry on business trips.Although I don't often have time to say it, the independent booksellers on Amazon are amazing. They have access to a wonderful selection of books - I seem to buy many that are now out of print - and give great service. The descriptions of the condition of the books are accurate and we often get them in record time. The booksellers I contacted for this book were very helpful and responded to my inquires immediately."
1,Did a 5 year old draw this book?,"This book is the worst book on the male form ever,his drawings are comparable to a begining artist with no drawing experance. This art belongs sketched on a wall with gang griffiti. I have purchased about fifty books on this subject in the past year and I wish that I would not have wasted the money on this book."
4,..,"it seems too be good quality, and ""ends"" are rubber not plastic which is better, BUT it is not 4.5 inches it is 3 inches sharpening portion of it, and 1.5 inches of rubber ""ends"""
4,Good Pick,"4 out of 5 stars simply because I don't think there will ever be the ""perfect"" pick.I personally struggle with going from a combination of strumming, single-note playing, and fingerstyle (and I hate thumbpicks, even the newer ones designed to be better). The advantage of the DAVA is that you can switch between strumming and single-note playing/lead playing with relative ease. Generally, I just use the Dunlop Jazz III's for lead lines, but they are not very good for strumming - just not designed that way. The DAVA does give you more control over what you want to do but you have to work with it and it takes about a week to really get accustomed to the design. As for fingerpicking, you still have to throw it down and switch to your nails, but elsewise, this is a great pick for most situations. I recommend it to players who need the versatility."
2,order not filled,"Ordered 4, received 2 with note 2 backordered. several days later order cancelled because they cannot get.Disappointed"
3,There's still room for improvement,"I bought this water bottle because I have a very active beagle who routinely dismounts her stainless steel food and water cups while she is crated. This bottle lasted about two days before she had it off of her crate. She had managed to chew off the spring which holds the water bottle upright and stretched it to the point of uselessness. I repaired it with a couple of chain links and a small bungee cord, but it's still a hassle to dismount and remount the bottle when the water runs low.I think Lixit could improve the mounting of the bottle with a clamp of metal or plastic that surround the bottle and can be bolted to the crate, as I've seen on other competing products. The mounting system is the weak point of the product (at least for energetic dogs) and it needs to be addressed. Apart from that...it delivers water, and, if you follow the instructions, it doesn't leak."
1,Caution: One-Time use design,"This waterer works only okay, the water is leaking all the time.However, that is not the worst.This waterer is extremely hard to apply. You need to break your finger to attach this thing on the crate. Take it off? Sorry, it will hurt you again.The only recommendation: fina an alternative product."
5,Wonderfull!,As I ventured into the world of spinning there were a many books but none interested me as much as this one. The beautifull color pictures and easy to fallow instructions are the best. even the projects in the back have meaning to the beginner spinner. The best part is that there is instructions on how to make your own spindle!
3,still need instructions,"I've never spun anything in my life. I found this book, and after looking through it, I WILL say, it has good illustrations,but, still too advanced for me. Like I said, I know ZERO about fiber, yarns, spinning.I will still have to have personal instructions to learn how to spin any yarn or fibers, or whatever term is used.I wanted to know exactly how to pull fiber from roving, and how to do the tension thing properly, and how exactly to get it to go from the pile of roving to becoming a piece of yarn. I haven't learned that from this book, yet."
4,Great CD for listening or teaching,"I think this is a wonderful CD for fans of Brown, Blake, or folk music in general. William Blake's poems set -- word for word -- to accordian, harmonica, pan pipes, mandolin, and guitar. Beautifully arranged. I have given this album as a gift to English majors and played it in class for students--a great resource for teachers. One English professor called the CD ""dull"" and found ""every song the same."" I suppose she has a point -- many of the songs do tend to blur together after a while -- but I think his covers of ""Introduction"" and ""The Tyger"" stand out very well. I think this would be a great CD for kids -- it's a pretty mellow album overall, great for nighttime listening -- and a fun way to introduce children to poetry."
3,Not the First or Last,"I really like his version of ""Tyger Tyger"" -- found myself humming it after a single listen. Sometimes Brown seems to be stretching or compressing the lines to fit the melody, but I like that loose, folky feel. There are many other versions in several different genres of Blake's songs, from Benjamin Britten's liederesque one and Allen Ginsberg's warbling harmonium settings to heavy-metal Ulver and most recently Martha Redbone's THE GARDEN OF LOVE, which is in the same musical style as Greg Brown's. If you teach Blake's poetry as I do to college students, these recordings are all useful."
5,Really like it,"Although Brown has said in many interviews that he'd rather forget this cd, I really liked it and it made me like evn more Blake's masterpiece. It's naive and touching and different from brown's output in general, although his great voice is still here."
5,Just one problem,"That problem is that I'm so in love with the rendition of 'How About You' on the second cd of this incredible set that it's difficult for me to play the rest of the songs, let alone any of my other cds. I have many fine cds of piano trio recordings, but this is my current favorite. I echo the sentiment 'What a bargain'!This trio plays with so much restrained intensity that it just sizzles. It reminds me of the feeling I used to get from the MJQ - a feeling that there was much more in reserve, but that we were listening to something very special.If you like trios, do yourself a favor and get this. I defy you to listen to 'How About You' only once. It is a wonderfully memorable performance.Erskine never fails to astound me with his exquisite taste, and he is in the company of giants with Carpenter and Pasqua."
5,"""To Love Again"", smile with tears song...","""To Love Again"", Smile with tears song...kinda recalling good past days all we had, with family, friends, lovers, companion animals,remember each happy, precious moment,playing baseball with dad & bro, a fine breakfast mom made on a sunny sunday, ' the first date with a new lover, caressing your' dog sleeping just beside...etc,but the days departed...notice again you don't have them in both hands now,only beautiful memories are echoing and that makes you smile...Thanks Alan..."
4,Good for work folders,"My son had one of these from his teacher that is used as a homework folder. I thought it would be perfert for some things I needed to file at work, but I could not find them at any local office supply stores. They are just as good as I thought they would be. Durable and easy to use."
4,Good,"I'd give it 5 Stars but I haven't tried that many brands as my violin comes in 4th in raking with the other instruments I play. The rosin I have is 20 years old and before turning over my 1918 Chezch Violin to my 11 year old, it was time to get a new piece."
4,Violinist for 7 years,I'm a high school student who attended an art school for 4 years. I've also been a part of many city youth orchestras. This rosin plays very nicely and has lasted me for quite a long time.
5,Great,"I am happy with this rosin, I like the way it is boxed, and like the cover cloth. It is easy to apply, am happy with this product"
3,Book Description,"Setting is Ancient EgyptThough grief-stricken at the death of her parents, there is nothing raven-haired beauty Anqet prizes more than her beloved home, Nefer, and her freedom to be its mistress. But when her cruel uncle, burning with lust and revenge, seizes Nefer from her, Anqet has no choice but to flee --- vowing to return to claim her birthright.Anqet's fiery spirit and astonishing beauty prove irresistible to Seth, a mysterious barbarian half-breed and close advisor to the young pharaoh. Drawing her into a web of intrigue and desire, his fierce passion brands her soul --- and seals her destiny to his forever."
4,Humor Doesn't Come Any Blacker than This,"It's a simple idea - two salesmen going door-to-door, offering housewives a demo of their product. They don't mention that the demo includes unconsciousness and a side-effect that will take nine months to be fully revealed. Shepherd Mead is the author of ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,"" and that same twisted slick sense of humor is in play here. If you like truly black humor, look for a copy of this out-of-print book.Before you conclude that these two fellows are impossibly horny, you have to realize that their employer is an alien race bent on conquering humans by, well... the title really says it all."
3,"Even when he was on top of the world, he was only human.","Lance Rentzel led the Dallas Cowboys in receiving 3 years straight. The Cowboys were one of the NFL's up-and-coming teams in the late 60s. Rentzel was from a good, high-class family, he had been an All-American at Oklahoma, he was a handsome pro athlete, he was even married to the beautiful actress Joey Heatherton. Even though he was on top of the world... he was human, and he had a problem. A few days before the team was going to play one of their biggest games of the year, he was arrested for exposing himself to a young girl. Rentzel gives his account and doesn't try to deny his actions, only offers insight into his life that led him to that point.I enjoyed reading about an NFL player who had problems long before it was fashionable to do so."
5,Fine book,Getting to know all of these characters and love all of their personalities. Will continue to read and enjoy always.
3,Gunpowder Green -A Tea Shop Mystery,The book was easy to read and well written. It held my interest and was also informative about various varieties of tea. It was a perfect book for my beach vacation.
1,"Great Cover, Poorly Written...","Previous reviewers have already pointed out this book's many shortcomings. Let me add to the list with my biggest beef: about a fourth of the way through the book the author reveals who the murderer was in her previous book, ""Death by Darjeeling"" - which is a HUGE no-no for mystery writers. Did Childs ever stop to think that maybe someone might, as I did, read the second book before the first? That seems like a real no-brainer to me..."
2,"Tea info is good, mystery is not!","The author of Gunpowder Green did something I've never seen before, after a lifetime of reading mysteries. She specifically names the murderer in the first book, Death By Darjeeling! This is very bad for the backlist! Even if I liked Gunpowder Green (which I didn't), I wouldn't go back and buy the first book, now that I know ""whodunnit"", would I? A good editor should have caught that, even if the writer didn't.My other problem with this book is the very contrived dialogue. I suppose the author means to convey that Charlestonians have a very elegant way of speaking, but it comes across as just stilted. Also, all the characters, young & old, male or female, seem to speak exactly the same way!The best part of this book is the tea trivia. Gunpowder Green certainly wouldn't encourage me to buy any more books by Laura Childs."
4,Theodosia caters a sailboat race and a murder,"Theodosia Browning and the staff of her tea shop have the honor of catering the annual sailboat race in Charlestown. The starter, Oliver Dixon blows himself up with the antique starter pistol. The newlywed, 60ish, millionaire has no reason to kill himself and it doesn't look like an accident. Theodosia and her staff help Detective Tidwell solve the mystery.This is the second of what I hope will be a long running series. The characters and settings are very interesting and the mystery is very good."
2,"Lovely atmosphere, mystery lacking","There's a lot more than tea brewing at the Indigo Tea Shoppe in this second installment of the Laura Childs series. Unfortunately, the plot doesn't keep up with the atmosphere. Clues point in every direction, but even on a second reading there's no ""aha!"" moment when the reader can see -- ""Oh, that's where the murderer tipped his/her hand!"" The plotting is not getting better as this series progresses."
1,One-Dimensional Writing,"I've tried to give these books a fair chance. I like the Charleston setting and there are some good recipes in the back of the book if you enjoy tea. However, the writing gets in the way. All of the books in this series contain sentence fragments and don't seem to have been proofread. The characters are one-dimensional. They are not likeable. Theodosia is a busy-body, and comes across as an arrogant know-it-all who really has an issue about competing with the police and obstructing justice. Haley is irritating beyond belief. Drayton seems to be the only regular who is not obnoxious. The plots are silly. I would probably go to the library and page to the back of the book for the recipes but would not waste the time and money reading these"
5,Makes me want to visit Charleston!,"After reading this series, I want to learn more about tea and Charleston! The cast of characters is just so wonderful!"
5,tea lovers book,"This is a well written mystery, captures the essence of the South and if one is at all interested in Teas, this is a must read."
1,Much ado about tea,"If one wishes to read a book about tea, then this is certainly a wise investment. If, however, one wishes to read a book that is well written, this is not a good choice. I knew who the villain was before reading one-fourth of the book. There is far more telling than showing--too many adverbs, too many adjectives, too many signs of novice writing. I really do not recommend this book for the serious lover of mysteries."
4,Makes learning med terminology easy,"This book makes learning medical terminology very easy. At first I was skeptical of the ""programmed learning"" approach - it seemed much too repetitive and grade school-ish. However, I found that as I finished each chapter in the workbook, I retained the majority of the information. I definitely recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn the basics of medical terminology without putting forth a great deal of effort. I found the workbook to be fun, and the CD, which includes sample quizzes and learning activities, was extremely helpful."
3,Medical Terminology Review,This book is useful for students preparing for a program or new job in the health care setting.
2,Pages Missing,"The description for this book said that it was in good condition, however, when I went to the appendix to study word roots, probably the most important section of the whole book, I found all of the pages I needed had been torn out! Essentially, this made the book worthless and I ended up having to borrow one from a friend."
5,The book was in better shape than they gave it credit.,I have had an excellent time ordering my text books for school. Just knowing how much money was saved by doing the seach online is rewarding. I had no problems. By my experience I would order again.
4,Book Review,"I felt like the book provides you with too many answers, and it is distracting being able to look them all up. The different body systems should have been separated not thrown together it is too much information to have to learn all at once. The seller provided a positive experience and the book was as described. Besides having my problems with the book, I like i a lot."
4,Med Terminology-Simplified,"I recently took a Medical Terminiology class & passed it no problem. This book is set up the same way. This is a very effective way of learning something that is very difficult; the answer is in the left side of the page so you get immediate feedback. I like this way of learning; I also had a really good teacher, which helped to get this course done within 8 weeks. This time I am retaking terminology to accompany Medical Transcription and to use as a refresher. It is an online class & I figure I will have no problem gettng through this again because of how it is set up. I would think learning English grammar in this way would make it easier also."
5,Medical Terminology Simplified,I am very pleased with this book. It is very in depth and EASY to learn from.Medical Terminology Simplified: A Programmed Learning Approach By Body Systems
2,Not enough info needed for the course,The book does not contain much info in order to complete the course. It leaves out other medical terms that are only listed/mentioned in the CD tests. I am not too pleased with the limited info in this book.
3,review of a textbook,They have some items in the book wrong. Hopefully your instructor or professor have already found the pages. The dji-intestine stuff is set up in wrong order of the book-be sure to have your instructor/professor note this in their book or lecture. Haven't gone thru the whole book yet but you are forewarned. But the setup is easy to study with if that is any consolation.
3,"Good price, but ...","I bought this used and it smells like it to. Quality is good, but I'm kind of ""put-off"" by the smell."
4,Concise pronunciation help,"If I knew this little book would eventually be worth nearly 50 dollars I would have taken better care of my copy. Very direct pronunciation help with sections on production, comparison (minimal-pairs), sentences and a paragraph to read, and a section on phrasing and intonation. All in two or three pages per phoneme. I have used it for years as a guide and a source of examples for my ESL classes."
3,Simplistic,An OK book. Story became quite predictable.The lack of smooth transitions was confusing. The basic outline was good but the execution needed much editing.
4,Sexysexy!,"My partner got me this for Valentine's Day and I listened to it on the commute home, and boy, did he ever think it was a good investment! The readers seem to be really into what they're doing - they take it seriously yet have fun with it, and the stories present a wide variety of orientations and scenarios. I REALLY enjoyed this and am doing some more erotic audio shopping on Amazon today!"
3,"GREAT idea, bad execution","First of all, these""poems/problems...?"" are not funny. I suppose they were at a loss for a title. BUT, that said, the author had a great idea. I've had students grades K-8 follow this pattern with AMAZING results. Publishing their problems that make sense would have been a better idea than publishing these half thought out ideas.A good kindergarten example: pink tongue + warm nose+ brown fur + wagging tail - listening - age = puppy!It's not rocket science. Maybe they were in a rush??"
1,you get what you pay for....,"Thought the price on these belts was too good to be true -- it was. Tacky and cheap-looking. ""Leather"" was plastic."
3,Good belt except for the fake leather,"This belt was very reasonable priced, which is probably why the leather is fake (plastic). There are no eyelets to fasten the belt, which is ok with me. If I had had the time to do further research, I would have paid more for a fabric belt with actual leather."
2,Disappointed!,"I had gotten 2 other belts just like this one, but from a different company and was very pleased. This one had the prong on backwards so I couldn't fasten it. I bent the prong so I could get it through and still use it. The first and only time I wore it, the belt loop fell off, so now I can't wear it at all."
3,streatchable belt,"seems to be good quality, but ran very large--I could have done fine with a medium, but it may have been sized more for men."
3,Good value but...,"This belt seemed like a good deal for the price. Sometimes, though, the elastic doesn't retract after stretching. I am not sure why. The color and design were as described. I just wish the elastic was a better quality."
2,The Cellet Black Rubberized Proguard Cover Case did not meet my expectations,"I was greatly disappointed with the quality of the CELLET BLACK RUBBERIZED PROGUARD COVER CASE. The thing that caused the most disappointment was the quality of the detachable belt clip. It did not have a sturdy connection with the cover case, as a result after I had clipped the case/phone, it fell off three times. The third time, the cover case hit the concrete, and the two halves of the case split, and sent my phone slidding across the ground. The result, I ended up with the very thing I was trying to avoid scratches/blemishes on the phone.I started to return the case, but the cost of the shipping would have been more than I had paid for the case. So, while it was economically priced, the quality was substandard."
2,Poor choice,"Pros: Material has a smooth but gripping rubberized texture. It covers enough surface area and is suitable at minimizing shock damage from short drops.Cons: The opening for the SD flap is way too small, and the opening for the stylus is just small enough to make pulling out the stylus a chore. The edges on the belt clip are just sharp enough that they can dig uncomfortably at times. Finally, the clasp that holds the phone in place on the belt clip is quite weak - it's easy to pop the phone out without pressing the button."
2,broke in a week,bought the case for my palm and it broke in a week. The spring flew out of the clip and i cant even use that now.
3,Almost perfect,"I love this cover case for my Treo 680, it's got good grip, is not bulky, and doesn't interfere with the keys like other cases do. The only flaw is that it blocks access to the SD card slot. It looks like it was designed for a slightly different model (not sure which) but while all the other holes match up perfectly for the camera eye and speakers and charger access, the SD slot hole is way off. Also, the stylus is a bit tough to get out, but not impossible."
3,Very pleased...,"I bought this cheaper (even with shipping) on line than it cost at my local Walmart, and my granddaughter is thrilled."
3,Nice doll - but the top was impossible.,"So it seems silly to downgrade a review because one of the pieces of clothing was virtually impossible to put on but a doll is a doll is a doll... and you buy them for the kids because of the things they come with or the character... if I was reviewing just the outfits it would be 1 star but the doll itself is nice and rates a higher score. Still if you're going to buy a Hannah Montana doll I'd buy a different one.The black top that it comes with took ten minutes to get onto the doll and will need to be surgically removed.Otherwise the doll is quite nice, flexible and seems to be of decent quality for a barbie type doll."
1,From a 9 year old,I really hated this doll because it was so hard to put on the clothes. Also the doll doesn't look anything like Hannah Montana except for the blonde hair. The cloth isn't very strong and some clothes do not have any velcro on it. I only enjoyed this doll for 30 minutes so if I were you I wouldn't get this doll!
1,Parents Beware,"Although the clothes that came with this doll are appropriate, the thong painted on her under the clothes is not. Beware that the thong even sticks out of the jeans the doll came with and can be added to the long list of ""hooker barbies""!!!"
3,Anything helps for registry,I did use this book to challenge National Registry after 11 years. It helped but it was not my favorite.
1,Almost Worthless,Misspelled words throughout. A couple of the answers are just plain wrong. This alone is enough to say DO NOT BUY! I (unfortunately) used this as an exclusive study guide by making sure that I could get 100% on all for tests in this book before taking the actual CBT exam. Just got my results and I did not pass. The actual questions that I got on the exam were just not covered by this book or even close enough to be helpful. I strongly recommend to use anything and everything else EXCEPT for this book!
2,Not the Oscar you think it is,"Although the description implies that this is just different packaging for the Oscar fragrance you know and love, it is a completely different scent, and unfortunately, just not my taste...er...smell(?). The fragrance is not the spicy, floral undertones I've loved for years. Instead, it's a much fresher, water/linen scent. I'm sure it's very, very nice, if this is your style...but if you are looking for a familiar Oscar scent, you won't find it here."
5,TEKTON Drive Star Sockets,I was looking for a star socket set on the internet to handle the basic needs of servicing my car at home.I found this TEKTON set at Amazon.com and it was exactlty what was requred for me being of good quality and at a very reasonable price. The postage of the socket set was also very prompt. A good purchase.Thanking youhallen
4,The Maze,The book was in good condition and it was as I expected. The only thing that I was a little disappointed about was it did not have the cover.
2,Big waste of time,"All of the Theater of Horror dvds are disappointing, except for ""Dead Girl Walking"" which is the best of them all. In general, the stories leave you wanting more , and yes, they all have a spookiness about them, yet they don't deliver. And, to make things worse ""Death Train's"" audio cut halfway through.! But that's okay, I'm just keeping ""Dead Girl Walking"". If you are going to buy this, get it cheap as possible. I recommend buying ""Guinea Pig"" over this to see Hideshi Hino in action. ""Dead Girl Walking"" gets five stars alone. The rest, watch when you just want to pass time."
1,Theater of horror,Watching this dvd the sound dident work on any of the dvds there was rings and deep grooves on dvd pure crap Im getting my money back.
5,Nice Report Cover,Nice for a report cover. Slim profile and flexible tabs. The heavier plastic helps give it some heft. Great for just putting daily calendar items in order as well.
4,Nice chain. But take these reviews with a grain of salt.,"The chain is quite pretty.That said, anyone buying this product on the virtue of these reviews should be aware that whenever Gem Avenue receives a positive seller rating, they request that their buyers review the products positively as well. Therefore, the reviews that appear here are skewed to reflect the buyers who liked the product, not those who didn't.I, for one, liked the product. But caveat emptor."
4,Nice,"It was nice and shiny, like a bright white kind of shiny. The person who I gave it to liked it. I would buy it again."
4,A COLLECTION OF TRIVIAL FACTS AND RECORDS,THIS IS A NICE COLLECTION OF UNKNOWN FACTS AND RECORDS CONCERNING BASEBALL. THE AUTHOR DOES A NICE JOB OF PUTTING ALL THIS MATERIAL INTO A NICE READ. THIS IS FOR THE TRUE FAN WHO IS CONCERNED WITH STATS AND TRIVIA. RECOMENDED FOR A TRUE BASBALL FAN.
3,Wait to see it on TV,"The pictures of the cave are amazing, but I am not sure that I would recommend that anyone pay to rent this."
3,Poor acting/script but incredible visuals,"About 25 years ago on a real-life cave diving expedition (Nullarbor), a freak storm collapsed the entrance to a cave and trapped 13-18 people. Andrew Wight was part of that expedition and drew upon that experience in writing this script.It's basically a man -vs- nature survival movie, with a background story going on with the relationship between ""Frank"" who seems a tough character, and his son ""Josh"".Actor Richard Roxburgh (Frank) puts in a fabulous performance, but while watching this movie I kept finding myself noting most of the other performances seemed poor (especially the ladies) as well as some of the interaction scripting. (a bad sign in a movie)However, while it is not likely to win any acting or writing/directing awards - the struggle to survive will catch you up in it here and there, the cave visuals are realistic and incredible, the action is pretty good and camera work was very well done - which makes it worth a view."
3,Drownings Galore,"If, like me, you liked the drowning/liquid-breathing sequences in ""The Abyss"", you'll (like me) enjoy this movie too. Good for producing claustrophobic, breath-holding anxiety and relief that you're not down there, underwater in the dark, with this bunch of obnoxious nutters."
1,"A shallow, swirling mess...........","The underwater cave setting of this film couldn't obscure the fact that it contains just about every movie cliche known to Hollywood. (Thank you James Cameron). About 10 minutes into this drama, you'll get the feeling that you've seen it all before. You have - just above ground. The dialogue is silly, the acting is poor, and the character's actions throughout the film defy all semblance of logic. Everyone dies in the end, and by the time you get there, you really won't care."
1,What a baaaad movie,"This movie was so bad, I'm swearing off James Cameron films.There was a whole Star Trek element to this, where the people in the red shirts are the ones who died. Pretty stupid that.The father - son relationship was not at all believable.The Xanadu quote throughout the movie was very tired.The movie failed to emphasize the one that thtese teams really have and that is a very team work bond. In this movie, the team was a group of egotistical millionaires, who thought to hell with their team.The directing was bad. The writing was bad.I'm done."
5,sanctum,this is very well done in my opinion and at times very frightening for those with problems with claustrophobia orthe prospect of drowning. I think it was very well done. Stephen Spielberg is the executive director.
1,sanctum,"i did not purchase this video.it waspurchased by someone i do not even know.you say it was david roxburgh.i would like to sent it back but i do not know where to send it.thanx, ron wood"
3,"If you enjoyed The Abyss, might be worth seeing","If you're considering watching this because its executive producer is James Cameron, you're probably hoping for an experience similar to The Abyss. (Pretty reasonable, and I don't think you'll be disappointed, so long as you remember it's not *directed* by James Cameron, so lower your expectations a notch.) However I found some scenes to be more violent and graphic than even Cameron's Aliens. This movie really earns its R rating, fair warning!Besides that, the weird dialog, some editing and character issues, I was entertained throughout and have been left thinking about it days after. Recommended."
3,Only for large-screen 3D TV's,"This is a straightforward film about a cave-diving expedition, which should have been a documentary. It would have been as intense and claustrophobic, but without the unnecessary conflicts between the explorers. What make this film worth watching is the 3D. Watched this on my 50"" 3D panasonic plasma. It is visually glorious.Can't imagine watching in 2D, or on a small screen. Like Avatar, there are no out of screen effects, just super depth perception. It's like the screen punched a hole in the wall and your looking into the next room. Three stars for 3D, but barely two stars for 2D"
3,"Fun on home theater, but otherwise, meh.","I wanted something visually dramatic and action-packed to enjoy in escapist big-screen Blu-ray glory on a Friday night and that's exactly what I got here, but I can't say the movie was particularly good. I found myself disliking all of the characters and thinking that this dour bunch really took the fun out of exploring an amazing cave system. If you aren't watching this on an HD home theater system, don't bother."
4,Great action adventure,"This film should be watched for what it is, a fascinating and mesmerizing action-adventure flick. The acting is way above average for this type of film and it is well-paced and beautifully photographed. It takes the viewer to places few of us can ever hope to see. The primary interest, aside from the amazing atomsphere and scenery, is the psychological reaction the characters experience when they realize they are trapped in a life-or-death situation. Thanks to solid performances from the mostly Aussie cast, we feel their struggle and desperately hope for a satisfactory outcome. I agree that the script could have been better-crafted in order to provide the characters with a more humane perspective rather than the cliched, every-person-for-himself mentality we're shown. But the bottom line is that this film will remain with you long after you viewed it, giving you pause and wonder about this amazing rock we call earth."
2,its a big bore,"very disapointed with this one. movie was boring, acting wasnt very good, and frankly i couldnt wait for it to end. 3d was average."
4,Very good movie - especially if you are claustrophobic ~,"Great movie with decent cast. As it progresses, you can't believe that things can get worse (and they often do!). What makes it even more incredible is that the entire movies is based on real events - amazing! Plus - if James Cameron did it, can it really be that bad?...)"
1,"Bought New DVD, Shipped Used Defective One with note attached.","Sold ""NEW"" from Amazon & it's actually ""USED"", because a lime green sticky-note is on the back of the DVD with the plastic shrink-wrap sealing all as if it is new. Sticky-note reads ""Stopped working at good part"" ""DC Service Identification"". This was sold & shipped by Amazon.com and not by another company selling their products on Amazon. Not so Cool Amazon, hope I don't have to pay for return shipping too....."
2,Reality check,"Where to start? As a real rebreather diver, I thought, how bad can it be? WOW. I agree, the first shot of the cave hole was cool. So was the tank from WW2. So how about that boulder that sat there for eons, just to plug the hole when they needed to get out? You just got to love that ending, where did that come from? The real thing is happening right now, TED did a cover on it. Script, where did it go?"
4,"Not a bad movie, sort of cool in 3D, watched in both formats","Not a bad movie, kinda true in that its based upon real life. I watched the 3D version, and my youngest son wanted to see it also, so the next day we watched the blue ray."
1,"Not worth it, watch something else.","I had been wanting to watch this for a few years. James Cameron had something to do with it, why not? Other than learning about scuba diving in caves, it really wasn't all that interesting. I actually regret seeing this movie as a lot of the scenes were cringe-worthy. The one thing I did appreciate was that if someone is claustrophobic, diving underwater in caves is terrifying. One of the scenes does a great job with letting the audience know how and why this is a tangible fear. I just failed to see any redeeming quality to take away from this. There was not enough of character-building to make this worth watching at all. One scene, I can't get out of my head and deeply regret have seen. I admire and respect the magnitude of difficulty it must have been to shoot this film. I know that it must have been quite an undertaking."
2,Where's the Spanish Audio Track?,I got this for my mom because of the Spanish audio track listed. The DVD has NO Spanish audio track. It does have Spanish subtitles but wish I knew the real specs before buying it. The movie itself is just ok.
3,It its a good movie...not a great movie...but still good,"I would recommend this movie for anybody who has entered and explored caves.Caves are wonderfull and creepy...there is no sound from the outside when youare inside, the views are unique, crawling from tunnel to crack to whatever isfreaky and after a while, you cant wait to be back out of the cave. But as soonas you are out...you want to go back in...i know its crazy... but i had to mentionit as it makes this simple film into a good film. You can feel and sense thesituation the actors/actresses are in...its real cool."
1,Great 3D but a horrible movie.,"Truly great 3D - some of the best I've seen.BUT THE MOVIE!!!GROSS - GROSS - GROSS !!!The reviewer that called it a colossal mess was right on. Really didn't need the guy drowning another guy. Give me a break. This was supposedly based on a true story. One has a tendency to think some of this - including the above deliberately graphic disgrace - was for ""effect"" whatever the ""effect"" was supposed to be.If you watch this just be prepared for some of the most severe selfish, self-centered idiocies that could be filmed.NOT FOR THE SQUEAMISH!"
1,What can i say?,"This is the first time i'm making a review on the content of a 3D movie:The worst i've ever seen.Even 3D is OK, it means nothing to me in this movie.I would admire your patience if you were able to watch this movie completely.I gave one star for technic and well 3D, not for the film itself. Bad story, bad actors and really very very boring..."
1,not impressed,"It seems more like a B movie with cheesy wrote lines, and predictable sorrow... no comparison between this in Avatar. There was no magic, no stunning beauty, it was unimpressive. Rent it, save your movie for something better!"
2,"It's okay, 2 stars","In the beginning I thought of giving it 1 star. It was so slow paced, I felt like watching another movie instead. But I did move further and further. Plot reminded me a little of other movies. Guys from expedition are trapped in a cave and almost no one survives. But to all that, here is a boy who's dad is a real walking nightmare. He doesn't know his dad as a person until they get trapped together. I must say the end made me think of giving it 3 stars. It was very sad and touching. But then it's only because the ending was sad I can't give the whole movie 3 stars. It is worth watching, but don't have high expectations from it."
3,Sanctum,"Great scenery, beautiful locations, a packed with action and thrills.A twist between every corner. James Cameron pulls off another great thriller"
3,Not enough depth,"Sanctum is about extreme adventure gone all wrong. This extreme adventure team is led by Frank Mcguire ( Richard Roxburgh) a pioneer explorer and joined by his son Josh ( Rhys Wakefiled) As with all parent son relationship this one is downright uneasy, however the movie gives them a chance to settle their differences. The rest of the team also has issues with friction and the caves give them a lot of opportunity to settle their scores and air their differences.The film has been beautifully photographed but the script has been poorly written and thus did not hold my attention. I was primarily drawn to this movie because of production duties helmed by a certain James Cameroon but needless to say.... a pretty boring and average film. 2 stars 7/16/2011"
2,My Closet is More Claustrophobic,Negatives:I've seen more interesting caves in the Western US.Not claustrophobic - at all.Story was a bit of a long stretch.Acting was too over-the-top and unbelievable.Cinematography was minimal predictable and uninspiring.Set prop rocks and cave were not that real.Positive (thus two stars):Nice aerial shot of Cave of Swallows hole.(P.S. Film supposed location is a composite of many places and props.)
3,As expected...,"So first I didn't really enter this movie with high hopes. Really just wanted another feature film in 3D to watch. As for the story, it was pretty silly and certaintly cheesed up for the big screen. I found alot of the movie itself rather predictable and full of mediocre acting. There was some suspense to the movie, just waiting for something to happen. There are no monsters or creepy critters in the cave, it is based on true events, however ""based on"" is a loosely used term. Overall the movie was alright, worth watching once not really anything spectacular. The 3d didn't really impress me all that much, it was average. Really it just tried to bring you more into the cave with them, then to project items outside of it. Gave it a solid 3 stars due to the fact that it never really was built up to be a great movie, and it lived up to expectations."
2,Its Sanctum shall be the previously viewed clearance bin,The only reason it got 2 stars was because the the picture and audio quality were superb.The movie itself is boring and annoying in a Aussie accent in a informercial type of way.The 'Cave' genre is a pretty niche market. Only one movie to really watch in this category and The Descent is the benchmark for claustrophobes and horror fiends.
1,Run from this,"this is a B movie, nothing happens, I can't beleive cinemax is playing this, what a waste of our time, hope this helps you"
3,not enough 3D,The story became better because of the 3D but there wasn't enough 3D. You can't compare this 3D with Avatar's because there really isn't that much. The story moves slowly and it's a predictable plot. I hope Cameron is working on more 3D movies that rival Avatar. He moved the bar high with Avatar and doesn't match it with Sanctum.
2,This movie is an epic failure!,"Save yourself 2 hours and watch another movie. This movie was such a disappointment especially with such a big name attached to it. One positive to note admist the boring, painful experience is that you can take a break, come back and you'll be assured you won't have missed anything, because they'll still be stuck in the cave. This is one movie not even 3d can save."
2,"Great start, good middle, awful last act!",SPOILER ALERT. Do not read if you don't want plot points revealed.Why take such a beautifully shot film and turn it into the next version of Final Destination? There is nobody on earth who will view drowning your father as a mercy killing. I thoroughly enjoyed three fourths of the movie; the last act was just plain bad.
4,Larry Gets The Spotlight Finally,"Larry Fine's story is told for a new generation of fans, andit's an interesting read. Larry was there from practicallyday one, and there to the end. This book has great rarepictures and lots of info. Get it!"
5,Now We Are Getting Somewhere!,"I have been a Stooge afficiondo for many years. I have read what is available on the Stooges. Other Stooges books go from decent to just plain bad.Bravo Steve Cox for finally nailing it. Filled with much information that I did not know...(and thats hard to do).This is abosolutely a must read for the seasoned Stooge fans, as well as the uninitiated. Bravo Mr. Cox and Terry!"
4,one fine stooge,great book for stooges fans..a lot of stuff I knew nothing about and a complete history into the life of the stooges..Larry Fines memorabilia must be seen to be believed..
5,One Fine Stooge: One Fine Book for Stooges Fans,"WOW!This is one of the best Stooges related books to come out in a while.The pictures are second to none. I can tell that author Steve Cox put his heart and soul into this book.A book about the ""Center Stooge"", that Larry himself wanted to publish. Well, thirty some years later we finally have that book.Does it belong in the library of every Stooges Fan?To answer this question, Curly enters stage right...Why, Sointenly!"
5,ONE FINE STOOGE,"This book was a Christmas gift and I couldn't have gotten anything better. It was a terrific companion to the AMC network New Years Eve marathon. There isn't anything that's left untold in this excellent book about Larry Fine. You actually get the larger picture here: the entire story of Larry Fine's life and the history of the Three Stooges all in one and with color photos I have NEVER seen. I didn't even know color photographs of the Three Stooges existed. I'm so used to seeing them in Black and White. This book is glorious and any fan of the team will enjoy it's absorbing narrative by Cox and Terry. The BEST book yet on the Three Stooges, bar none! My coffee-table has this book right on top and what a splash it makes. Great conversation peice, too!!! The book's cover is stunning as are all of the photos and candid shots of the Stooges behind / scenes. ECW"
5,love it,This is an older Cd but has many very beautiful songsJim Lauderdale is a true musical genius and very appredciated by those of us who have been lucky enough to hear him live and on CD.
4,Eyewitnesses to Woeful Times,"This is an interesting account of one Anglo settler family and the impact of the Revolution on their lives. Most accounts are of participants, seldom do we get those of victims."
5,Trunk Organizer,This product was exactly as advertised. I was very please with the product and the transaction.
5,lots of storage,The packaging was great and the trunk had so many bells and whistles that there was a place to store everything!!!
3,Golf Trunk Organizer,"I would have given this a 5 if the sides would have been beefed up some. I cut supports from plywood and reinforced the sides of the organizer; otherwise, I am happy with the bag and it fits nicely in the trunk of my car."
1,Shoe compartment practically worthless,"I was excited to finally be able to organize my trunk. I am very disappointed though. The shoe compartment on the bottom is very low, it would be better for storing flip flops than golf shoes."
4,Good with a little help,"It is a good product. Solid Well made Except for the bottom shoe compartment. With a little help, I fix it easy. Went to the local hardware store and bought some cheap plastic shoe containers. Three fit perfect. No problem work like a charm and organizer is now worth the price."
3,Fantastic Trunk Organizer,"This is a fantastic trunk organizer for your golf equipment. It features plenty of pockets and compartments for two pairs of shoes and other gear. It achieves exactly what it looks like in the picture. The only downside is that the build quality is not as high as I would expect from Samsonite. The entire case can collapse to just about an inch tall. All of the walls inside are collapsable and appear to be a stiff cardboard or covered plastic of some sort. While I appreciate the collapsibility, the overall stability and solid feel is sort of lacking on the back. The fabric also feels a little thin for a Samsonite product"
4,Great storage for the Golfer or golfing couple!,"This well made storage case is a little larger than it looks in the photo's when it is in the trunk of my large DTS Cadillac with both mine and my wife's clubs, but it is a great organizer for a golfing couple to share. We store all or extra accessories in the top, as well as bottled water, and in the bottom, both out golf shoes. The only thing we had to do was to cut a stronger spacer for the shoe compartment out of plywood, so the weight in the upper compartment did not crush on our shoes in the lower compartment. Well worth the cost, even if it was just to organize in your mud room, but we use our truck as our golf locker for our club, shoes and spare accessories."
3,Everything else is ok but the shoe compartment is collapsing,"Everything about the bag is wonderful. However, the shoe compartment in the bottom is collapsing all the time. I am going to try and find some sturdy plastics to support the structure. I would think they would have discovered this flaw during testing :(3/2/10 - I placed cardboards[from shipping box] around the shoe compartment and duck taped them. Now, the shoe compartment is no longer collapsing."
4,Perfect for dancers too!,"Purchased this item based on the ratings and reviews. Bought as a gift for my mom who is a dance teacher to put in the trunk of her car as she is always carrying out multiple items in bags (shoes, cd's etc.). She appreciated the thought that went into the gift and was very satisfied with the quality."
3,Stronger bottom area,The bottom section needs more stability to keep it from collapsing on the shoes and other items that are placed in that section.
2,Good travel companion,"This product was a good idea at the time. But, as my husband pointed out, whatever you would put in this organizer is usually already in a golf bag, except for shirts.If you're a golfer that travels by car with clubs, this would be a good addition. However, having an added ""storage unit"" just takes up space in the car and has no real purpose.I bought it for my husband. He hasn't used it yet and we've been out golfing 2-3 times a week since June. For us, it was a waste of money."
4,golf trunk organizer,"This was a last minute gift and I was delighted with it, the faster I can get my husband out of the house the better!"
2,Collapsible sides collapse too easily and aren't firm enough,This would be a great product if the collapsible sides didn't come loose all the time and allow it to collapse. Velcro attachments aren't big enough to hold in place and material isn't strong enough to hold the weight of the top section.
2,disapointed,"This storage unit has a tone of space and a lot of compartments and pockets for all your golf gear. However, If you put anything of sunstantial weight on on top, like a box of balls, the product completely colapses on itself making the bottom shoe compartment very frustrating to use. I had to buy 5 inch wood pieces to reinforce the support for the bottom compartment."
3,"Works well, but not right","I was excited to get the bag to help keep my golf stuff from being all over my trunk. Overall it works well, however took some extra work by me to make it functional. The bag has lots of storage, however, the divider for the top compartment was put together backwards and the Velcro on a few sides did not line-up. I was able to buy some Velcro strips and fix it myself. The lower compartment is too low and the sides and are not very sturdy and would not hold itself up. I like the other reviewer used a couple of golf ball sleeves to fix the problem.Ultimately, the bag does what I wanted it to; it was just aggravating that I had to come up with solutions to fix the problems, as calls to Samsonite were not helpful."
3,OK for $20,"I bought this to replace another trunk organizer (non-golf related). I really wanted something to organize my workout stuff in my trunk. The pictures on Amazon make it look bigger/taller than it really is. I thought the shoe compartment was a really cool idea but it's kind of flimsy. I paid $30 - $10 mail in rebate (still waiting to receive). For $20 I think it's decent, but for $30 I would pass."
1,Poorly made and very light weight,"I just got this in. I was hoping it was a decent product being it had some good reviews, but it isn't. This is very poorly made and very light weight. I am going to return mine and see if I can find a better bag."
4,Hope this helps,"I got this for my Dad, an avid golfer who carries the tools of his passion with him - leaving little space for anything else in his car. I hope this helps him get and stay organized. He seemed to really like it when he opened it, I hope its as useful as he anticipates."
4,Just what I needed,"This will be a godsend for keeping my golf stuff organized in the trunk or back of the car. Yes the section for the shoes needs a little support, but a little ingenuity and all is well. Well worth the price I paid for it!"
3,Golf Trunk Organizer,Not as sturdy as I would have expected. Really to small for what I purchased it for. Would not purchase something like this again without seeing it.
5,Good gift for avid golfer,got this for my dad who is always golfing. Seems well made and has ample space and more compartments then he'll probably ever need. Good value.
5,Great organizer!,Decent quality....good price....great for organizing the mess in the trunk! Great if you have an SUV with an open storage area...no unsightly clutter
2,"great product, except for the shoe compartment","I saw this product and purchased it right then. I am disappointed because the shoe compartment is basically useless. I've tried any and every way to make it work short of putting some wood in there and it's just a lost cause. The idea is great, I still use it, just collapsed the bottom and use my shoe bag I won. My trunk is much more organized than it was and it's help lighten up my back by being able to keep all my extra gear in the trunk and only take what I need."
4,Golf trunk organizer,"I am a contractor who plays a fair amount of golf, so this organizer allows me to use my truck to haul materials to job sites and quickly convert to golf mode by tossing it and my clubs in the back of the truck and everything I need is right there. I only have two negatives: 1) the mesh on the shoe compartment catches in the spikes and 2) the opening is too low for the shoes to slide in without me lifting up on the upper part of the opening. Otherwise, it's a great product and a good buy.LB"
5,Not Just for Golf Equipment Organizer!!,"This trunk organizer is so much more useful than just for golf equipment! In fact, I purchased two of these organizers; one for my vehicle and one for my husband's truck. We use these to store emergency equipment, a change of clothing and for a few personal items in case we are stuck somewhere and can't get home. I plan to purchase 2 more truck organizers for emergency equipment for our house. Samsonite, you have a triple winner here!"
4,large trunk organizer,This organizer is well built and has pockets for everything. Very easy to put together. Organizer is pretty large. Take note of the size before buying. I finally have my golf things in one place.
2,Bulkier than you'd think,"I bought these to replace my regular earbuds that were damaged while I was traveling. They aren't as convenient as they claim to be. The storage ease was nice, but walking around with the cord retractor banging against my hip wasn't so good. The mechanism that retracts the wires got jammed a few times, and it's tough to adjust the wire length to a custom fit. You either have them open all the way, or wound up. I wouldn't buy them again, unless it was an ""emergency"" like last time."
1,Terrible product,"I would give 0 star if I can. The description of this product says , ""This 48 Inch retractable stereo earphones offer incredible sound from a compact design, making it ideal for use with MP3 players, portable CD players, Laptops, Walkmans and portable DVD players."" Well, it does not fit any of the mobile products I have including my laption, cell phone, and MP3 player. I should have listened to other reviews."
1,Won't fit your iPad or iPhone,BEWARE--Very disappointed that this won't fit my iPad or my iPhone. This should be stated in the description. Now the hassle of either buying an adapter or returning the product. Wonder what it does fit ????
1,AVOID AT ALL COST,"I bought these for my husband to work out with them. The wire does not recoil back. you only hear sound out of one ear, an they are flimpsy. Don't waste your money an time with these thing."
3,good game but expensive,I would have given this a higher rating if it weren't so expensive and if you live anywhere but Japan than it will be expensive since it's not available anywhere else. It's definitely a useful game but for the price I would recommend My Japanese Coach instead.
4,Most cost-effective electronic dictionary out there,"Pros- Cheap: even if you do not already own a DS this is largely cheaper than getting an equivalent standalone electronic dictionary- Look up words by writing the kanji or inputting the kana. Also, English to Japanese.- Kanji recognition is very good, provided you know the stroke order- Large word selection & also some standard phrases / word combinationsCons- Does not have many onomatopoeias or psychonyms- Sometimes gives only a contextual example and not a definition.- English to Japanese only gives kanji, not the reading"
4,Nihongo Wakari Masuka ? *Do you understand Japanese*,I originally bought this for my Mom to use but I started to tinker with it myself. It would of been great if they added a feature that read the Japanese words like they do for English words. But overall it's a great tool for learning both English and/or Japanese. I'd recommend it !
4,Kanji,GREAT KANJI DICTIONARY. I used to carry around a kanji dictionary that was very cumbersome and this dictionary made it easier because I just needed my DS.
5,A must have for any Japanese Students,"A must have for anyone studying japanese. It's not perfect, but its a hell of a lot cheaper.Fast look up, helps you remember the stroke orders as well.The big touch pad makes it very easy to write compared to pocket dictionaries which have much much smaller spaces.Makes great use of the two screens."
5,transformative book,"i am in the midst of reading this beautiful book before i go to Wildquest retreat center in Bimini to participate in one of their human-dolphin interactions. Just reading this book has brought about some type of healing in me; i am learning about dolphins not just in a scientific way but more so in a real way through many peoples experiences, observations and wisdom of interacting with wild dolphins. I highly recommend this book particularly those interested in dolphins and also for anyone interested and involved in the healing arts."

I have swam with dolphins at sea world! and I Did Expirience a healing I have been arround The petting pool at sea world of California And expirianced many many healings!

1,Decaf sugar free Suisse Mocha,This may be the nastiest tasting coffe drink I've ever tasted.It literally tastes like it has ground up metal in it.
5,You will enjoy it!,Excellent! The movie is very enticing and informative. It is well made and I highly recommend it. Wish there were more such movies for my kids to enjoy.
3,Ok,"This is not a bad straightforward blues/rock album, but it was recorded five years after the band had disbanded. 1974 was a much differant time than 1969 in rock music, and this album lacks the eclectic expermentalism of Long Time Commin' and the self titled follow up.The blues on here is pretty generic--this is an not an exciting record, but it is not bad if you are curious or a Flag Completist."
4,The exact same as if you bought from the store. WORTH BUYING,"If you are looking at this lotion to save money depending on what price it is now then you made a good choice. It smells the same and the consistency of the lotion is perfect compared to the ones I bought from the mall. I got about 5 of these and although the casing (the bottle) of this lotion is not that great compared to the ones from the store that did not bother me much. I did get a bottle where the cap got messed up after several use and somehow somewhere at the bottom of the bottle it began the leak. I give this product a 4/5 due to the small yet annoying damages, other than those annoying defects I would definitely buy this lotion again."
4,I use this lotion as an after-shave.,"It isn't easy to find CK Be any more so I bought 2 of these at a time. I use this after I shave before I spritz on the CK Be colone. There may be a better body lotion out there, but if you like the scent of Be, this is good stuff."
3,+1/2 -- Acoustic Americana goes global for Christmas,"This acoustic Americana sextet (Phillip Aaberg, Darol Anger, Alison Brown, Mike Marshall, Tim O'Brien and Todd Phillips) mixes string-band bluegrass with American jazz and British folk traditions on this reissue of their 1998 debut. The material blends traditional European material with American gospel, and the arrangements range from contemplative (almost New Age) piano interludes to hoedown-styled fiddle and lively gypsy jazz. O'Brien sings ""Greensleeves,"" ""In the Bleak Midwinter,"" and ""Go Tell it on the Mountain,"" and the remaining performances are instrumental. This reissue includes a bonus track of ""While Roving on a Winter's Night,"" recorded live in 1999. This would make a nice addition to any string-fan's holiday CD carousel, providing background music that's punctuated by a few upbeat tunes to fill the conversational gaps. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings. [2005 hyperbolium dot com]"
3,A Pleasant Escape,"Claudia Schmidt is a folkie with a lively voice and a taste fortraditional American popular music. On Big Earful, she temporally setsher folk roots aside and takes us back about 75 years to the world of early 20th century Negro music. Big Earful is a reverent collection of gospel (Bend In The Rover), blues (Pretty At The End), swing (Rock That Sucker) and torch. If you ducked inside a smoke filled Chicago jazz club circa 1925, you could expect to hear `You Can Call Me Baby' and `Danger Zone.'The disc has an underproduced small club feel: intimate and comfortable. The straight folk stuff is Claudia Schmidt's signature. `Herds Of Words,' `Novembering,' and `Roads' feature solo vocals backed by her pianolin, marxolin and humonium. These seldom heard piano string instruments add an eerie other-world quality. Big Earful is a pleasant escape from today back in time or to some mysterious place. END"
2,Slow-moving -- not his best,"I love Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales (Last of the Mohicans, Deerslayer, etc.) but these are....just.....so.....slow.....moving. The detail is interesting, but the dialogue is stilted and plot telegraphed early. Unless you're contemplating a thesis on the writing of Cooper (and you need info on his more boring works) I'd skip this"
1,"Awful, Simply Awful","These markers arrived all dried out, I don't think there is much more that needs to be said."
1,$5 per marker?,"Let me preface this by saying that I have NOT purchased this product.I'm in the market for some very fine-pointed dry erase markers. The fine-tipped ones that you can pick up at just about any department or office supply store are OK, but I'd like something with a finer line - the ""fine point"" markers leave a pretty fat line, and make it hard to write letters under an inch in height. I run out of space on my whiteboard frequently. (It's a big board, but I've got a ton of active projects on there.)But that's not why I'm dropping the 1-star rating on this product.The issue isn't the product - it's the price.$14.99, plus $4.95 shipping (Prime's not an option), for 4 markers.Are these magical pens? Do they have MP3 players built in? How can anyone possibly justify $5 PER MARKER? You can pick up a 3-pack of EXPO fine-tipped markers at Wal-Mart for $5 total.The pricing on these is a joke."
1,Don't buy this DVD set!,"Buying this set was a terrible mistake. Most DVDs freeze up mid-disc. There are no menus, the video quality is poor, and the packaging is cheap. A shameful product."
1,Boot,"Terrible bootleg that Amazon should not be listing. It's amazing that the 2 studios that own the rights to these 40 shorts haven't stopped this. On the other hand, boots like this wouldn't be around if the studios would just release a nice box set or two of the stooges for the legions of fans that want them."
1,ATI Distributor DVD Poor Quality,This DVD set it awful. Don't buy any DVD's from ATI distributors. Some of the shows pause occasionally during play. Overall quality questionable at best.
3,I've had better lavender oil.,It's not a bad oil but it's not the best lavender oil I've had for the same price.
3,smells good,uhhh...it seemed like there were only two drops inthe whole bottle but yeah it smells good not sure ifit works to cure toe fungus
1,Ml to ounces,It would be a good idea when selling to Americans that the product be labeled in ounces and not in the metric system. I didn't buy the product due to this error and won't as long as it is used.
5,Love plantlife!,"I've been buying Plantlife's Lavender oil (and other essential oils) for about two years and this is definitely my favorite one. I've used other lavender oils before this one and while they're all 100% pure essential oil, the others' scents don't last as long or have a funky smell to them. I usually just use it in my burner which I've also purchased from Plantlife, but it's also great for adding scents to bath salts or moisturizers (it's best to dilute it). Each bottle lasts about 6 months for me with regular use. The scent is very purely lavender and VERY soothing."
2,"plantlife, more like imatation life....",all the plant life oil's ive bought were kinda crappy. they smell good for like 15 minutes then vanish. So I just use them in my daughters bath.
2,"Not all the songs are the ""Best""","I wasn't all that impressed for a ""Best of"" album. I hadn't even heard of some of the songs and then at least one was a song that was a remake."
4,Polymer clay,"I like the fact that this clay is already colored and there is a big selection of colors. Now I don't have to worry about using dyes or paint to color the clay to the color of the object I am making, which really cuts down on mess, time and expense."
1,Out Dated,"This can be taken off the site, now. It is a ridiculous proposition to sell this thing for $1500 in 2004, let alone close to five years later."
1,Are they serious?,"No, I haven't read this!I just question the sanity of putting a $1,500 price-tag on a report whose title gives all the information you need (or would have needed in 2005)."
2,Not one I would buy,We bought another version and it was fine. But this car arrived and the remote could not communicate very well with the car.
5,A clear teaching on the Tabernacle !,"This book on the Tabernacle, a detailed portrait of Jesus Christ by Rev. Paul C. Jong offers a very clear and helpful teaching.Everyone of us can understand the truth manifested in the Tabernacle, and be born again by the gospel of the water and the Spirit.A study of each element of the Tabernacle, with clear explanations, and Bible founded.TO READ ABSOLUTELY WHEN YOU WANT TO STUDY AND UNDERSTAND THE WORD OF GOD ON THE TABERNACLE AND BE FREED from your sins believing in it !"
3,"Interesting Subject, but....","The topics covered are interesting, and relevant to network analysis in corporations, but the sections should have broken down a little further. Too much text tends to bore readers who are a bit more technical. Maybe include more diagrams as well."
4,An Eye Opener!,"Mises loses little time in exposing his tremendous intellect. I was surprised at how Liberalism has changed from its classical form to the ""neoclassical"" genre today, i.e., the ""Progressives."" It seems to me that the author uncovers the basic change in Liberalism which, as I understood it, is the gradual but increasing belief in the greater role of government in society. The book is aged but still quite valuable. Classical liberalism is equatable to freedom in the numerous spheres of society, especially the economy. Mises thus touts the capitalistic form of the free market. The main problem with the book in this respect is that it fails to take into account the changed circumstances of many of the industrialized nations, particularly the demographic ones, i.e., growth and ethnicity, and in the globalization of economic activity. These changes factor heavily in the need for more government involvement in a very complex society. Still, there's a lot to learn in reading Liberalism."
5,Liberalism - Not what you might expect!,"Today the word liberalism means something different than it does in this book. It is not a book about political persuasion. If you are beginning a study of different types of economies, however, then this a book for you. It's a a short but thorough work on capitalism that is not so technical that the reader is lost by the end of the first page."
2,Long winded,A long winded treatise on the author's opinions....I am a libertarian and had a hard time getting through the philosophy speak.
1,A rehash of other works!,"A very shallow work little depth from Mises. Much of what is presented in this small book can be garnered from the Mises Institute website for free. A waste of time for a book. Much of Mises writing is free on websites, so be careful when ordering his books."
5,Perfect Gift for Jazz Lover,"A gorgeous book, it gracefully fuses art and literature into a beautiful form with a most compelling story. Any jazz fan will appreciate the depth of the writers research into the making of this historical album and into the mind of the master. The interviews are fresh and fascinating, the photos sublime. One of the best music books I've read in years."
3,Highly recommended for the uninitated,"But if you are a long time Coltrane fan, there is nothing new here. And the guy is not a musician, so expect the usual metaphores when trying to describe what is happening when Trane and company play. Since the actual master tape for the session runs a little over 60 minutes, there is not much to tell about the actual session itself, and many pages are devoted to where he was born, when he plays with Miles, what other people think about it (even that guy from the Byrds!) etc. But if you are just getting into jazz and into Trane, it is a good purchase. Good photos as well."
2,book quality,The half tones in this printing are horrible; there is an International Edition available with far better pictures.
2,"Not good for Undergrad, Maybe Okay for Graduate","I had this book for MAE160 at UCSD. This book isn't good for undergrad because the material is so scattered. Since it's graduate and undergraduate level, you will not cover a lot of things in undergrad classes, which makes it not clear what to cover. Also, no answers or solutions to the provided problems, which make it difficult to verify that you're doing it correctly. Overall I really dislike the book, but can see that it'd be useful if you read it FRONT TO BACK and really combed through the material. It's written more like a series of research papers then like a nice Prentice-Hall textbook."
1,Awful text,"The treatment of most topics in this text is qualitative at best, not the quantitative, rigorous analysis that top materials engineering programs expect. The text also has some glaring errors in mathematical manipulations and very little explanation of what the authors are trying to do, which makes it harder to catch mistakes."
3,Adequate,"So its a text book. Since its materials it is full of empirical equations. However, it doesn't need to be this boring. There are basically two types of text books. Ones that are meant to impart information to you, and this type which are very hard to understand because the author feels that his/her subject should be above most levels of understanding. I think its worth buying because its cheap and has tons of info, but it's written like someone didn't want to put the work into making it interesting."
2,Pretty old story,"This Kindle book turned out to be something on the order of the Tom Swift series of the past. Ok, but really meant for children, I think."
2,Hoax,The cover and the text do not match. Not at all what I wanted. This is a fictional adventure for teenaged boys. In that light it is a fine book. I would have loved it when I was 16 and if the cover reflected the plot of the story. If you are looking for adult reading about WW1 ASW this book is on another planet.
2,The Submarine Hunters,Ifound this story a little bit feeble really it would suit a young boy . It was a struggle to get to the end and when i did it was a relief.
5,"Best on the subject, a gem","This book is the best on this historical subject to come down the pike in decades. It illuminates more than the events. It makes us ""feel"" the people. Don't miss this chance to gain an indepth understanding of what it was like to be there that day in that city when American began to change."
4,A Must-Read for Kids and Adults to Read with their Kids,"In a thoughtful, sincere, approachable tone, Sharon Robinson offers young adults wonderful examples of character-building values based on nine by which her father lived his life in baseball, business, civil rights and at home. She has compiled this anthology of writings based on her own stories, her father's writings, and also writings by and about other notable individuals who she feels also embody Jackie Robinson's values. For any young adult looking for guidelines by which to model good behavior and for any parent looking for another means of imparting values on their children, this book is a welcomed addition to the family library. I would give it to any young adult I know."
1,It broke too quickly,"I bought this microwave because I didn't want to put down a lot of money on something I would not be using to do any major cooking. For what it is, it works fine.... when it works. Most of the time, the touchpad controls do not respond when you push the buttons, (even to a whole lot of pressure!) rendering it absolutely useless. So I was left stuck with a false sense of hope for being able to heat or defrost anything. At first it was just temperamental. At this point, I am looking for a new microwave because the touchpad is utterly broken. It's a shame that one should have to pay more money just to get the buttons to work. No more Sharp microwaves for me."
2,Oven review,"This oven is good. It is efficient and I've never had to much problems with it. It's a good oven for the price, not as fancy as the others, but does the job. For simple uses and I guess its better than wasting so much money on more expensive ovens."
4,good deal,"Love the Crais, Burke Winslow and Parker books set in SoCal. Took a shot on this one-far beyond my expectations, will read sequels."
5,Great characters and series,"Discovered Jeff Shelby & Noah Braddock w/Kindle free book offer on Wicked Break - enjoyed it so much I came back and bought the first 2 books. Some formatting problems with the Kindle version, but the book is worth overlooking them."
5,sonic masterpiece.,"This album is amazing. It recalls to me a time when producers like Timbaland and The Neptunes first started getting recognition for their work. When their beats were a mix of pop-creativity and artistic flair. Such is ""The Hollywood Recordings."" Having been a Sa-Ra partners fan for a little over a year now, I can attest that they do not fail to innovate or excite. THe production is A+, feeling both pop and hip hop (Hieroglyphics and Jedi Mind Tricks comes to mind). This CD will be in rotation at all of my parties for a while now!"
3,A Little 2 Much Hype,"Honestly after waiting about two years to hear an album from these guys i kinda expected more. The production is tight but nothing extraordinary and the songs just don't hit the spot for me. Their eclectic marketing combined with them being co-signed by some of my favorite artists (Erykah Badu,Kanye West,J-Dilla etc.)definitely contributed to my expectations. If you like stuff like this listen to Spacek's two releases Curvatia and Vintage Hi-tek. Spacek is the true progenitor of this new wave electronica. Not hatin just expected a little more."
4,Creative...Podnuh!,"Sa-Ra has had a slight buzz for some time due to their other projects working with cats like Ice T and Bilal and Dr. Dre. The first official release from the group is an eye opener. From the opening key of ""Hey Love"" its easy to tell that this is not an album that fits easily with the status quo. Creative on every song, like it or not. Give your mind and ears a break and listen to something that will actually challenge the senses. You'll feel better in the morning!Stand Out tracks:Hey LoveDo me gurlSo specialAnd ifFish Fillet feat. Pharoahe MoncheThrilla feat. J Dilla (RIP)"
2,The 2007 version of prince,"There is nothing wrong with making music that is a bit ""outside of the box"" but for some reason this album hit my ears wrong. I like Hip Hop and i also like soul, and when the two come together that is a delight but it didn't work for me on this album. Don't get me wrong the songs that had featured artist such as Talib Kweli ""Feel The Bass"", Capone-N-Noreaga ""Not On Our Level"", and Pharaohe Monch ""Fish Fillet"" where ultimently the high points on the CD but it just wasn't enough to keep me listening. If you want a CD that has a great blend of soul and hip hop cop ""Popular Demand"" by Black Milk"
1,Beaded Critters,We ordered several bead book on this order and this particular books wasvery poor in illustration and outrageously priced.
3,For true fans only,"This is a reissue of Richie's 1981 release, originally on the Elektra label. It represents the beginning of Richie's foray into the pop arena. Although I am a big Richie Havens fan, I've got to say that this album doesn't suit him at all. There are a couple of gems, however. ""Going Back To My Roots"" is a real toe-tapper, while ""She Touched My Heart"" and ""Here's A Song"" are nice ballads. On the whole, this record is largely forgettable and really only for the completist that has to have everything Richie has done.Tracklisting:1. Mama We're Gonna Dance2. Every Night (Paul McCartney cover)3. You Send Me (Sam Cooke cover)4. We've Got Tonight (Bob Seger cover)5. Ol' 55 (Tom Waits cover)6. Going Back To My Roots7. Dreams (Fleetwood Mac cover)8. She Touched My Heart9. Fire Down Below (Bob Seger cover)10. Here's A Song"
2,Hidden Christian agenda,"My friend checked out this book, and so I read it to see what it was about. The book says nothing on either of the covers to describe what it is - a Christian lesson. I'm sure that Christian teens might find this a fun read - but I think the book should say what it is somewhere so that those who don't want a Preaching don't spend their money on it. I also found it a bit disturbing how exclusive the morals in the story were. In one section a ""psychologist"" talks to Beka and tells her something about how some people think they can just be good people, and that's enough, but really they must accept that Jesus died for their sins, or they'll burn! I felt like I was sitting in the front row of a Baptist sermon, cowering at the fire and brimstone speech. However, this book may appeal to some fundamentalist, or some sects of Born-Again Christians...for the rest of us, it just provides a giggle, and a ""oh my god! This is so creepy!"""
4,"Raw, fast, intense early thrash metal","Sodom was never the most technically proficient band in the world, but their enthusiasm, attitude, and knack for writing catchy (if unmelodic) thrash tunes more than made up for their amateurish musicianship. This early material finds the band at their rawest and most untamed. For the more nostalgic metalheads out there, this will definitely bring you back to the early days of thrash metal. For the younger people who never got to appreciate this stuff the first time around, listen to this record and hear how much it influenced all the ""tr00 elite black metal"" bands out there. Regardless of what other bands you listen to, this stuff is fun with a capital FUN. The songs, particularly ""Witching Metal"" and ""Deathlike Silence"", never fail to put a big, sloppy grin on my face every time I hear them.One warning though: the track listing on the album is incorrect. ""Witchhammer"" is actually the last song, and ""Volcanic Slut"" is tenth."
5,S!O!D!O!M!!! Aaarrrgghhhhh...,"Bleaauurrghhh....TRASH!!!! thiz iz HELL!!!sodom are representing pure evilness...the handpainted cover iz awesome...the muzic iz well..aahhh..mhhh....aaaaarrgghhhhbbllleeaauuurrgg....just sodom...i can't control my feelings..i will alwayz love sodom...i'm gonna baptise my children SODOM all of them...im am so happy now...i want to go for a walk in a flowergarden and sing with the birdz blasphemer..and i want to kall my mum to say that i love her...and SOOOOODDOOOOOMM...& seious now, in the sign of evil is great early black-trash, raw & grimm, great drinking metal, support sodom...& start your collection now, chronologically...one love - SODOM!!"
3,Digital display disappointing.,"Very good analogue display, very easy to see in the dark. Accurate within 15-20 sec/month. Battery lasted appr. 2 years, then the analogue display began to lag behind. But the digital display is awful, black digits on green background which becomes darker green with decreasing light. The wristband is very comfortable, but weak in its attachment to clock and broke afte 1 year."
4,Fair Enough,"Good watch in a style I have been looking for.I wish that the digital display would go back to the first item after a delay. It is nice to be able to just go to stopwatch with a given number of pushes instead of thinking ""Ok I'm on the second time so I need push how many times to get to what I want...""I shouldn't have to think about that it should be a natural part of me. Functionality is fine, just a usability hiccupBest watch I've had in Years."
3,"slightly dissapointed , but its ok c+ ,b-","I usually buy casio but wanted a brown watch , casio lacks in brown wristbands that are half way decent .I saw the timex , it is a nice looking watch a little small !!! smaller then I was expecting . Casio for the same price the watches are a little larger (a man's size watch) ...I still will wear it on occasion , It lights nicely , good looking band , and face ,,,the size brought my score down from an A TO C+ OR B-"
3,Still going,"I've had this watch for around 5 years and it's still going. It's had one battery change and 4 new straps in that time. Unfortunately, this watch has a problem with corrosion - the back plate is in a very bad way, as are the buttons. The front bezel and crystal are still immaculate though. I don't really wear this watch anymore, but it's still sitting in a drawer ticking away. Always liked the look of it too. It probably had 3 years of solid use and abuse before it started to corrode and the battery died - so as long as you only expect it to last that long, then buy with confidence."
5,Love it!,"I bought this watch over ten years ago, it finally gave way. I just ordered another one. Great watch, has date, two time zones, looks great in the office or you can wear it anywhere. And, you cant beat indiglo!"
1,ex-software engineer,"I had a very similar watch for 10-12 years that finally died. I liked the watch so I bought this (I think it's the same model) to replace it. Within a few days of getting it, the buttons quit working. So I'm returning it. After reading some of the reviews of the watch, I'm afraid to get another. I think that Timex may have switched to cheap manufacturing over quality in the last 12 years. Too bad."
4,Buying #3,"This watch has all the conveniences of a digital watch but looks like a grownup's watch. I've owned 2, both of which lasted me for quite a few years -- I replaced the band on both at least once. #2 died today, so I'm going to get a third. It's well worth the price."
3,timex44,Nice appearance and solid construction. Instructions for setting the digital portion are lengthy and confusing.
2,Disappointing,"This watch looks good and was delivered promptly. Unfortunately it didn't keep time. It would be fine for a day or so, then promptly lose a couple of hours. I returned it to the supplier (Chelsea Watch) and asked for a replacement. After about a week they issued credit to my Visa rather than sending a new watch. This is the first problem I have had with a Timex product, so I believe it to be an isolated incident. Overall it was a disappointing experience however."
4,"Great watch, small nitpick","This is the third time I've purchased the same kind of watch, so obviously I like it. My only problem with it is that the first loop on the strap is too close to the buckle. It's almost impossible to get the strap through there the first few times, and it's always a strain on the loop after that. It's no wonder that's always the first part of this watch to break. Other than that, though, I've never had a problem and it does exactly what I want: tells time in multiple time zones simultaneously and provides a countdown and stopwatch."
4,ATTRACTIVE AND DURABLE,Very attractive and sturdy watch. It is a bit heavy but for the price i really love the watch.
1,"Six months of good service, and then broke down","Watch was exactly what I wanted -- analog for time, digital for date. Very nice watch band, well made leather. Worked fine for six months. Then the light and digital date stopped working, and would not switch digital modes. Two weeks later the analog stopped working. I checked the Timex website -- two complaints identical to mine. I called Timex -- watch still under warranty. I'm supposed to mail watch back and pay $8 handling fee. Simple me! I don't get why I must pay for something that is obviously their problem. They didn't advertise watch as a six month watch."
5,Hunnah #2,"...Really love watch...but...I have had it for two weeks, have had to have battery replaced twice....now must send to repair facility for service...disappointing..."
2,So so watch,"Bought this watch several months ago...looks very nice...but, it's very difficult to adjust time, alarm, ect., overly complicated. Also the LED is almost impossible to read, it's just too small. Don't think I'd buy this watch again."
1,Analog hands get stuck - very disappointing,"Within a week of receiving this watch, I noticed that the analog hands occasionally stopped completely. The digital timekeeping continued without interruption. After resetting the time, the watch would run for a while before stopping again. I returned it and got a new watch (kudos, Amazon) with an explanation of ""dead battery"" for the previous one. After about 5 months, the same phenomenon returned. I had the battery replaced, but it continued to cease functioning, about once/day, sometimes more. That is intolerable. It appears that the seconds hand occasionally rubs against the minutes hand and they get stuck together. It is too bad - I really like this watch, but it is far too unreliable."
3,Not Bad,"Watch is not bad at all. But the analog does have a tendency show down... about 5min in 4 days. Maybe it's the battery. But, I do like this watch."
1,Out of Time,"I purchased the T44642 more than a year ago. Within a few weeks, the analog functions became erratic -- losing time and then fine for a few weeks or so and then losing time again. In addition, I found the instructions more than a bit confusing. In any case, a month or so later I replaced the batteries and the watch functioned well until a few months later. Again, it was a battery issue.I'm not interested in replacing the batteries every six months or so. And, needless to say, I'm gun-shy of the analog/digit combos now.I just recently replaced the T44642 with the analog T44381. Similar styling without (I hope) the battery issues."
3,Timex Expedition watch,The setup is not as intuitive as my previous two Timex watches. Older watches had a dial that could be turned to set the alarm. This watch does not have that feature and the alarm is much more difficut to set.
5,They did it again!,"The Polyrhythm Addicts did it again. This album is straight fire. The addition of femcee Ty Phoenix only made the group hotter. This is evident early on with Phoenix spitting B-Boy rhymes that will make Black thought of the Roots think twice on ""Smash"". DJ Spinna does the bizz with the beats bringing both soul and hip hop together in an harmonious mix of magic. Fams of true-school hip hop will not be disappointed.Standout tracks:Zonin OutThoughts of youRevampReachin feat. Pharoahe Monche"
4,ulsterwasright,well researched book good biography. hope to see more detailed book on the same subject. craigavon should also be researched to see his important part in the crisus
3,A Little Too Gentle... ?,"Maybe I picked the wrong day to play this CD but these 10 down tempo tracks from one of my favorite groups just didn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong, they sound beautiful, at times even exotic, but I like my 3rd Force with just a little more energy. Actually, I don't even think it's only about that. It's the fact the album doesn't change its mood. It just seems to get slower and slower, passing gentle and easing into tired. I might put it on another day and say, ""Hey, how peaceful"", or something but for today --- Yawn."
1,Cannot use in room with moisture,This product died after one use. I was hoping it would last a little longer. It says not to use in room with mositure but who would use this in a room besides your bathroom. Come on! Save your money and do not buy!!!
1,truly one of the worst products I ever bought,"out of the box this thing would fall apart; the grey interior part would slip out of the black part (see pics), so I would have to secure it with my hand while using it. After 4 weeks, the blade front part containing the blade started falling off, and would not stay attached for more than 5 seconds while running. Summary: complete garbage, it takes the honor of probably being one of the worst products I ever bought. Any $10 Walgreens trimmer is a ""Made in Germany Quality Product"" compared to this, and I will probably go back to the Walgreens trimmers; at least they last a year or so"
1,Pulls badly! and the insides fall apart!,"It will cut facial hair only if you go VERY slowly. If you don't it pulls and hurts. The cutting blades jam up and then separate, disconnecting from the motor. You have to take it apart to clean it and there are little tiny plastic pieces that are easily lost... and it doesn't work without them (why i'm writing this). don't buy this"
1,Nonfunctioning,"Plain and simple, received it today and did not work. Whoever shipped this please get in touch with me so I may send it back and receive another one that does work."
1,"Useless, especially for those with thick hair!","If you have thicker hair, this thing is useless and won't cut hardly anything - it *does* yank hair out though, one by one. As the battery wears down, it slows to a crawl. Don't bother trying to trim those ""sensitive"" areas - despite advertisements otherwise, it WILL draw blood if you use it without the guard. I would totally return this thing if it hadn't been so cheap in the first place, so I'll probably just throw it away."
3,Cheap and effective Trimmer,"There isn't too much to say about these. It does what you need it to/what it says it can do (not much else... don't try). What it says it can do, it does well. Battery seems to last a while, but I guess I don't use it too often.It feels cheap, but for the price it is hard to beat. I've found other options may be a bit sturdier but cost more than double. Eventually those die too.Do NOT use for manscaping. If that is what you are looking for spend a little extra on this:Philips Norelco BG2030 BodyGroom. This thing does what it says it will (which is very different than the Conair trimmer) and it was specifically designed for manscaping."
2,Works well about 4 or 5 times,"I have purchased 10 or 15 of these devices over the last 6 years. They are basically disposable like a razor after a few uses. I don't know what happens to them...they just stop working.I use them mainly for nostril hair and specifically for the thickest hairiest area just inside the front of my nose. When they're new they work great and I've not found any other grooming device that can do as fine of a job. However after several uses they just stop working. I've tried new batteries, but that doesn't seem to be what fails. I can pop out the old battery and put it back in and sometimes the device will start working again. Banging them on the countertop sometimes gets them to rev up again, but eventually they just stop working."
1,Not that good,This was not a very good purchase. I you are looking for a trimer look at something else.
4,Great Product,This is a great product. I have no complaints about it. It is able to be used ANYWHERE and it DOES NOT cut you. AWESOME!!
4,The Story Nobody Knows,"It's very difficult to find much information, especially accurate information, on these expulsions. This book is a very responsible portrayal. Of course the Germans in a way brought this nightmare on themselves, but its hard to really justify the hypocricy and historical distortions of the Poles and Russians. I wonder whether these border adjustments can stand the light, now being allowed, after 45 years of Russian occupation? The current dysfunction of these regions begs for German investment, dispite the ambivalence of the current residents. At least this book brings to light, for those few who have read it, the hypocrisy of the allies."
2,Vocabulary & Spelling Success in 20 minutes a day.,"I believe to brought a book new, But come to find out it was old. I suggest you don't but used books and be careful when it says new and is not."
5,Cuzin Alan to the moon!,"Quite a brag book for my 4th cousin! Gave it to my brother for his birthday, and was proud to hear that he left the Clan MacBean tartan on the moon...."
5,Alan Bean : Painter/Astronaut,"A truly magnificent portayal of mans greatest achievement. I followed Apollo 12 as a 14 year old kid back in 1969 and the wonderment of those flights to the moon has never left me. Seeing Bean's paintings puts me on the surface of the moon better than any photograph could. I advise anyone interested in America's Manned Space Program or the History of Art to buy this book. Unlike some of the reviewers in this section, I believe the astronauts of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs went on their journeys for ALL of us, not just to enable the United States to beat the Soviet Union to the moon - we must look at things far deeper than that."
5,sweet ass,"This live album is the closest you can get to capturing the magic of a live supersucker show. Which makes the name of the album appropriate. Eddie Spaghetti's banter is one of the best to ever grace the rock n roll stage. he'll have you laughing your ass off one minute and without warning slashes into a kick ass rock song that is hellishly ballzy. I have been a supersucker fan for years and the way the suckers have things worked out with their label, touring, and recording- it looks like I'll be a fan for many, many more years. ~ kado~"
3,Not enough Crystal,"Another over-directed concert performance. If you like watching the guitarists fingers, the drummer drumming, zillions of camera angles and dim audience shots almost as often as watching Crystal,then buy this DVD."
4,Crystal's Evening in Tennessee,"Spend a night with Crystal Gayle at The Renaissance Center in Dickson, Tennessee. Crystal does 22 songs, some written by her sister Loretta Lynn, some traditional songs, some gospel and the songs that brought her national attention. I give this DVD four stars. We are treated to an in-depth interview with her and some of her family members, This is worth listening to and watching if youu'd also like to know the members that make up her band."
5,A beautiful and relatively thorough baby book,I have one of these books for each of my children and recently purchased another as a gift for a friend having her first. The photographs are beautiful and I love that this book covers the first 5 years of the child's life. I enjoy books that provide places for specific memories or milestones as well as places to fill in other info and this book has both. I think it's a lovely piece to pass on to your child.
4,Still a great baby book.,"When my ten year old daughter was born, she received an Anne Geddes baby book, and I loved it. When I became pregnant again, I knew exactly which baby book I wanted for this baby, so I purchased another Anne Geddes baby book off of Amazon. I don't like the set-up of the new book as much as the old ones, there are a lot of pages of only pictures with nowhere for you to write. They also left out a few things I really liked in the old book, and added some things in the new book that I didn't really care for. I still think it is one of the best baby books out there though, as far as style and writability."
3,It's Okay,"Very pretty but as a Jewish mom, I always find it irritating that the page says ""First Christmas"" instead of ""First Holiday"" ruining the book for us."
2,Looked poorly stored.,"Although this was a beautiful baby book when it was printed, I recieved it very poorly stored. The only reason its recieving two stars instead of one star is because the inside pages were beautiful, typical Anne Geddes. IF this had been in better condition, it would have five stars."
1,Very dissappointed,The person who I sent the book hasn't been able to get it. I tracked the package and still saying incorrect address. Try to reach Amazon customer service and no luck!!!! I am very disappointed.
3,it's okay...,"The book is really pretty, however the glossy pages are not exactly ideal for the hand and footprints. And ink pens smear a little too. Best to use a permanent fine tip marker. I also wish the pages were a little bigger, so you could tuck full size sheets of paper in between the pages-- momentos & etc."
2,Wobbly with my GH2,"Might work well with a tiny camera. When the monopod is extended some, it is quite wobbly with my GH2. The legs are just too thin and springy. I returned this item.I was able to attach the three legs of an old microphone stand to my Manfrotto monopod. The diameter of the bottom section of the monopod was a perfect fit with the center hole of the mic stand legs.This DIY solution is much more stable than Manfrotto 678 monopod universal folding base."
5,Kin erase Gentle Daily Cleaner,"My husband and I have very different skin types. We enjoy the clean, not dry feeling this provides without multiple products."
5,excellent!,"I love this product. I've used many famous cleansing products such as Shuemura. I really like this. No need to use two products, for example, oil or milk cleanser and then a soap again. With this, I feel safe about cleansing my skin. I recommend this to my friend and she loves it too."
5,great product,"Kinerase is a great product line. Many doctors who specialize in facial rejuvination, surgery, sell this product. It works beautifully."
3,It's ok,"It's very gentle on the skin and leaves my skin very soft but after trying this I still prefer Origins Pure Cream. Now, as for Kinerase Ultimate Night Moisturizer ? I never received compliments on my facial skin until I started using it !"
4,it a great video game,"I bought this game because I love my little ponies when I was a kid. The graphics were very good and the story line was very cute. It would be great for young children, but because i am a 24 adult, it only took about an hour to complete the game but you have to write down a long password to get to the next level all the time and that is hard if you are 4 or 5...!!! any way it a fun game to play"
2,pony game is tough for little ones,this is geared for little kids but you have to write down a long password to get to the next level all the time and that is hard if you are 4 or 5...!!!
3,fun but easy,My 8 yr old enjoyed this game for a week before completing the whole thing.It was a little too easy.
3,"Lots of information, but dense","I probably need to give this book more time, but I had a hard time getting through it. THE KINGDOM OF GOD examines the Sermon on the Mount--important reading for any Christian--but it was hard for me to get through. It is a book to be ""sipped"" not gulped. It's not a large book, but one that probably needs to be taken in small doses and thought about in order to really understand and appreciate."
3,Awesome!,Hands down one of my most favorite shows and i can enjoy watchin it over and over again when everything else fails
2,messy and covered,"I believe this was the one I received that I had to wash off. chocolate spills on it and back cover torn up. I dont recall condition it said it was in, but usually I go for all the excellent ratings, I am after all buying these as gifts if its at xmas. its kinda embarressing when you have to wash food stuff off and explain the condition xmas morning to your son."
5,Awsome Comedy Sitcom!,"I love Zach Braff, and after following him and his co-stars in this sitcome I now LOVE Scrubs. Dr. Cox kills me with his sarcasm and I can't get enough of the episodes throughout the series. I look forward to more!"
5,Brilliant writing and fabulous ensemble!,"Love this show. Be careful - it is addictive. You can't watch just one! Wonderfully hilarious writing, and one of the best comedy ensembles ever."
5,The Hijinks Continue!,"Again, another spectacular season. The pairing of comedy with heartfelt observations is quite a combination. Having the whole season in one place is a great way to watch the characters develop and you can really see what the writers are trying to do here to tie the whole show together.The cast is amazingly funny. You can tell they have ridiculous amounts of fun filming this show. Watching JD and Turk re-unite after Turk's been away on his honeymoon is nothing short of hysterical! When Eliot goes on an interview for a fellowship position, I thought I was going to pull a muscle!Funny, funny, funny, funny stuff. Highly recommended!"
4,Best show A-NY-Wheeeeere!,"Whoever owns the first three should own this one as well. It might not be as glorious (My favorite is 2nd and 3rd season) but this one has a great visiting cast starting with Sarah Graham as Dr. Molly Clock ;) Who doesn't want to see that! Otherwise, everything is as it used to be; Extra's and comments by the actors...nice to have features! Worth it..."
2,The Turning Point,"Scrubs, not unlike any long running series has slowly reached the point of unwatchable and when this happens you eventually start to wonder at what point did this decline actually set in. Season 4 is the answer to that question. Disagree? Watch Seasons 1-3 back to back, take a few breaths and pop in Season 4. R.I.P."
4,Great Set,"Didn't watch this TV show when it first appeared. I discovered how great it was in reruns - and now in DVD. Can't get enough.Here is the title breakdown:1) My Old Friend's New Friend2) My Office3) My New Game4) My First Kill5) My Cake6) My Common Enemy7) My Last Chance8) My Malpractical Decision (Part 1 of 2)9) My Female Trouble (Part 2 of 2)10) My Unicorn11) My Best Moment12) My Ocardial Infarction13) My Lucky Charm14) My Hypocritical Oath15) My Quarantine16) My Life in Four Cameras17) My Roommates18) My Best Laid Plans19) My Boss' Free Haircut20) My Lips Are Sealed21) My Big Move22) My Faith in Humanity23) My Drive-By24) My Changing WaysTry watching some of these. Your mood will improve greatly. It's quirky yet intelligent. When Dr. Cox goes on and on in his dialogue . . . I mean, monologues . . . it's hilarious."
5,I like the MEdicinal,"Dramas..Zach BrafF has beautiful BluE eyes anD I want to Kiss this ""womanly"" BeinG! (Not..DudeSter! The Zach iS Hot!)..Dude! Hold up your stehescOpe.."
2,NO BLOOPERS!!!,"I hate to say this about such an amazing show, but unless you can find it for $19.95 or less, do not buy it. This season does not have an out-takes feature.No comedy on TV should release a DVD without a bloopers reel. Scrubs has always been known for the best bloopers. It's why many of us shell out $25-$30 for the season as soon as it hits the shelves. Interviews with the cast and crew are only valuable to the cast and crew, and deleted scenes are useful to remind the writers that you care about them. But the audience wants to be entertained with more than what we can see on Comedy Central in a few months. Seriously, the show is in syndication now, and the value of the actual episodes goes way south after that.Give me more to make me laugh."
5,Good Job!,"Fast shipping, it arrived safely and was exactly as expected. Can't ask for anything more!"
1,Hate it!,"Don't waste your money on this one!! Besides scratching, it just doesn't do a good job. I would never buy another Conair product!"
1,Wrong Product,I was completely unsatisfied by the product I received. The trimmer was pink instead of the advertised silver and not only this but it had little pieces of hair on it when I took it out of the package.I do not recommend buying from this seller.
1,Terrible,"out of the box did not work but did not return as to expensive too do so.I went to big box store in town and bought new one. If I had to return it would not have been a problem,"
4,I like it,"I like this. I use it on my eyebrows and face, it is gentle and does a good job. The only issue I have with it is that it can be finicky about the battery and having it in just right, that can be annoying. But when it works it does a good job."
1,Too Bad,"It doesn't work when Power ""ON"". I think to buy and wait for it is to waist time and money!!!!"
1,Junk!,Waist of money. It never worked. Taking it out of the package was a waist of time because it was always broken!!!!!
3,Good have more power,"This is certainly a good price, but it does not have a lot of ""horse power"". You have to go over areas a couple of times. It works fine, looks nice. It's just not an ""A"". It is what it is for the value."
2,buy if you like,"when i received this product and put in the batteries correctly, it wasn't working... I had to repair the item, and as we all know the only way to repair it is to take it apart forcefully, because there are no screws that makes repair easy. then putting it back together, was another hassle, because now it won't close properly, it's tied together with masking tape..."
1,A horrible product,"I've been looking for one of these for awhile to have ""on the go"". I based my purchase of this item on the reviews and this time it didn't work out for me.This product is very cheaply made. The cap falls off constantly and I have to shake it to get it to work. It doesn't trim anything other than very fine hairs. Any other stubble it can't handle. I'll never buy again."
4,Good for the price!,"It's not a super great, strong trimmer but it does the small jobs nicely, especially for the price. It takes care of the brow hair, upperlip hair, nostril hair, etc. Don't expect to get done any heavy duty stuff! Changing the battery is pretty easy too."
2,Not as good as the Remington,"I had a similar product by Remington previously, but gave it to a friend and then wanted to replace it. This product is not as good as the Remington. It scratches uncomfortably, and does not give a smooth result. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,not so great conair ladies trimmer,When I first got the trimmer I was really pleased with all the features but once using it I wasn't so happy. It does not do a close shave at ALL!!! I will be looking for a new trimmer asap.
1,NO GOOD,This product is no good.I Guess you get what you pay for.This item does not do the job at all.Wouldn't recomend.
1,Don't Buy This!,"I gave it one star because it pretty much broke and fell apart as soon as I opened the packaging. I would've demanded a refund or replacement from Amazon, but shipping it back would've cost as much as the product. Previously, I've used a $11 one purchased from Walgreens and it lasted years before the battery died. After this fiasco, I went to CVS to get my usual $11 one and it works great."
1,Had a different brand before but this just doesn't work!,I had a different brand before and lost it...couldn't find the same one so I bought this. SO unhappy! It makes your hair feel like stubble! It just doesn't get close enough. It's awful.
1,Not Good!,"How I wish that I could replace my old shaver (different company) but only saw this. It just doesn't cut it. Yes,pun intended. But hurts and scrapes the face and mows down facial hair, not cut it. Just my practical disappointed opinion.SEL"
2,Conair misses the boat on this product,"I have used or tried to use the Conair trimmer for several months. It doesn't always start. I have to remove the battery and reinsert it several times. Also, it doesn't always trim hair in the nose. It will cut but only after you keep going over the same area again and again."
3,hot pink?,"I don't have a real problem with the product, but given the picture, I was a little surprised when it arrived and was hot pink. Not exactly what I was looking for... but it's not worth making a big deal over."
2,not smooth,I bought this trimmer to replace my old one that I could no longer find. It is very uncomfortable on my skin. I do not like it.
5,Conair Trimmer,Works great! Better quality than the last trimmer that I bought. Love the little hidden brush- never have to worry about losing it!
4,pretty good,"works well for shaping eyebrows etc., but you had better have a steady hand. They don't last terribly long though--I have to get a new one about once a year. I consider it a must in my beauty kit."
3,Good sound but uncomfortable,"These sound really good but the band cuts into the back of my ear and is very uncomfortable. Also a couple of things to keep in mind with this style of headphone:1) You can't can't wear them and sit in a high back chair or sofa, the neck band is in the way.2) You can't wear them if you have glasses as the over the ear portion of the band sits right where your glasses frame goes."
1,"Comfortable, but the quality stinks","I've gone through two pairs of these headphones in about a year. The 2nd pair lasted only 2 months! I will not be buying a third pair. They are very comfortable, but after some use the sound starts cutting out in one channel or the other. You have to jiggle things around to fix it. I think the external volume knob is a mistake because it ends up being an additional moving part that is prone to problems. Eventually, the sound will fail completely, apparently from loose wiring. Buyer beware!"
3,"Nice look, so-so sound","I was attracted to this set of headphones by the design, volume control, price, and Panasonic name. While I generally like them, the sound quality could be a little better. When listening to some songs, the headphones impart a distinct hollow or ""metallically"" sound to the music. For instance, the music tends to sound okay, but the lyrics and voices fade into the background and don't sound like they should. This is especially noticeable on a song like The Eagles' ""Lyin' Eyes"". The vocals should be smooth and melodic, with the music ""just being there"" but somehow, the experience of listening to the song on these headphones just isn't pleasant. The headphones perform well, and they're okay for listening at the office, when the point is just to drown out background noise and focus on your computer, but if you really want to enjoy your music, I'd pick another product."
2,Agree with previous reviewer regarding poor quality.,I too have gone through two of these in the past 3 years for the exact same reason another reviewer has: the sound stops coming through one side. And while it was working I had to adjust its placement because of the pain it would cost my ears.
3,Pretty good headphones,I purchased these to wear at work and listen to music. I have no complaints about the sound quality and I like the fact that they have inline volume controls.My main complaint with these is that it is difficult to find a spot that they are comfortable to wear. if worn low down so that the bar is actually touching the ear it starts to feel like it is cutting into the ear. if I move it up a little bit it sits more comfortably but feels a little tight for my head (not painfully so) and at the same time it feels like it wants to slide off my head. They are still better then nothing and I will keep them until I find some better ones but then they will be the emergency pair.
3,good value,"Works well for work, able to control volume easily when people come up to talk to me.Good value foe listening to streaming music."
2,Cheap and not worth it,"I bought these because they were cheap and that is what I got. The sound is not that great, but the worst part is the headphones DIGGING INTO THE SIDE OF MY HEAD. After an hour I have to remove them due to the pain when the headphones squeeze my head. Pay a little more and get something that is comfortable."
3,"OK, but a little cheap","This product works just fine and fits into my toyota echo like it was built for it. The fact that it is made out of plastic and has almost no way to actually attach the radio to the adapter without buying yet another accessory kit is why it only gets three stars. I was able to rig something up by drilling through the plastic and attaching screws, but c'mon that is a bit lame - charge a couple bucks more and give us the attachment hardware."
2,"Very Noisy, poor output - avoid it!!","[...] I wanted one that had a UV filter. I have owned other warm mist humidifiers in the past and they all were acceptably quiet. However, the Slant Fin is very noisy - it gurgles almost constantly. My son is a heavy sleeper and it wakes him up at night. Also, the mist output is poor. For the level of humidity I need, maximum is barely sufficient and this is in a bedroom. The other humidifiers I've used in the past had much better output. I don't understand the good reviews from web sites. Bottom line: avoid it"
1,Those With Good Ears Need Not Apply,"I chose this unit mainly because I had read that it was quiet. If you're looking for a bedroom application, forget it. This thing gurgles continuously, and is actually quit obnoxious while you're laying in bed trying to get to sleep. I finally got up and shut it off. This ""con"" (along with it being kind of pricey) makes any ""pros"" irrelevent as far as I'm concerned, so I have nothing good to say about the item."
2,Nice -- but only when it works,"I had 3 of these units. I'd echo the comments others have made about the maintenance being a bit of a pain. The faint gurgling and boiling noises don't bother me at all. And it does a good job of what it's supposed to do: Humidify the room.However, in the 2nd winter season, on one of the units, I was awoken in the night to find the unit had shorted out internally and acrid smoke was coming out of the unit. I couldn't trust the other units (for my family's safety). Slant/Fin customer service was initially apologetic but made no offer to give me a new unit and eventually ignored my emails."
1,Avoid this product!,"This product is profoundly disappointing and frustrating. I first bought one in January of 2006. It arrived around January 15 and ran constantly until it failed around March 1. For no reason, the humidifier ceased operating at some point - the tank was half-full, there were no electrical difficulties in the house, but the humidifier stopped working. I figured I had broken it, so I bought another one in January of 2007. This one ran for about two weeks before stopping. I sent it back to Slant Fin, who took six weeks to repair it an send it back - too late to be useful in that season. It was packed away until this January, 2008. This time, the humidifier ran for four weeks before failing. Final cost? $189 for a total of approximately 12 weeks of humidification.When it worked, it was fine. Difficult to clean, but it really seemed to provide quiet, clean humidity. It just doesn't work for long."
2,Works good for limited use.,"Slant/Fin GF200 Germ-Free 2-Gallon Warm-Mist HumidifierThis is a fairly inexpensive humidifier that fulfills the old adage that you get what you pay for.I have used it for about 1 month at a time for 3 + years and it works fairly well, is a bit of a challenge to clean, but it is doable, especially if you soak the minerals in white vinegar or a demineralizer before you try to clean them. And now the bulb says it needs to be replaced, but appears to be working fine and is boiling away. Would I buy new parts for this unit-No. I would more likely go out and buy a new humidifier with a better satisfaction record. Which is what I am going to do."
3,"Good, but not for the long haul","It works as it is supposed to, but after about 3 years use, the water reservoir base started to fracture from the heat. Also, twisting off the gasket cap on the water reservoir can be VERY difficult (I'm an average sized man), which gets annoying because you need to refill the tank every day. Also, even with vinegar, I've had a very hard time removing the mineral deposits. And on top of that, the humidity now broke off the first year. So it works, breaks too soon, and is no pleasure to use."
3,Very bizarre,"And that explains why I sort of liked it - I think I did, didn't I? Yeah, sort of....and strong emphasis on the Bizarre aspect. Fun to watch only on the freak-factor side of mockumentory. Like a reality TV show with characters you cannot really like, yet the absurdity of the whole thing compels you to watch. I can say in good faith, rent first or at least, wait for the $5 dollar sale bin."
4,Buy this,"This is a must have for all serious gamecube gamers. I mean, the low price would be pretty good for just the screen itself, but with a controller, too! (okay, so thr controller might not be of the greatest quality, but that's the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5). And if you are complaning about the splitscreen capabilities, then don't use multiplayer with this product! It's as simple as that! besides, this is mainly for portable use, and you usually don't have many people with you when your on the road or in the office.It's got speakers, a color screen, and darn good graphics and picture quality, making it one of the best buys out of all gamecube accesories."
1,0/10,0/10 I own gameboy player accesories many and this doesn;'t even fit my nintendo playstation. The screen is so tiny I can't even seee myself breathe in the scrn. 0/10 babbyshit would not eat again. I can't even watch my pornos on the xbix -1/10 would not bang ugly face doodoo
5,Immigrant Writings,"This is an anthology of women writers writing about immigration moments, experiences, etc. I read it for an Immigrant Women class in graduate school and recomend it to everyone; those who are experienced immigrants as well as those who are not. The short stories and poems are wonderfully written. I laughed, I cried, I felt annoyance, outrage, and basically every emotion on the emotional continuum."
5,A Most Pleasing Recording,"I have had this album for a long time. I love it and my wife still plays it all the time. I hope one day there are more albums by these artists. Sometimes a nice easy tune done with great muscianship is the most pleasing of all music.... Young or old, jazz lover or classic worhipper, ..all will enjoy this Mountain Music. Great fun."
5,"Three years later, still sounds great.","What is there to say? If you know the Oregon band you know they always create good if not always great music. This CD is no exception. While the title track ""1000 Kilometers"" is superb, all the others also stand out. For example, ""Catching Up"" captures that unique Chamber Jazz like feeling, its Jazz but its not, just cuts across boundaries. I can imagine J.S. Bach grooving on the bass accompaniment and Mozart enjoying the sweeping melody hook, yet others may hear strains of a Latin bounce. Recommended.As another reviewer mentioned, the Prime CD was so good its hard to keep that quality up. Prime was just such a peak. Yet, this is also worthy. The only bad thing about Oregon is that it takes so long for a new work to come. It's almost 2010 and I'm still playing a 2007 CD on my daily drive."
4,The Valentine...generic but enjoyable,"I first heard The Valentine about a year and a half on there labels website. I knew exactly what I was getting into by ordering this cd. It's not new or different. It's melodic breakdown intensive metal influenced pretty boy hardcore. Just about every band that's popular in the mallcore world, sounds like this. Luckily, these guys do it better and heavier than most. And there are some EXCELLING moments on this 23 minute disc, such as the hand-clapping pile up chant that takes place just before the end of Famous Last Words before leading into a crushing breakdown.All in All this isnt a bad cd, it's just not anything new at all. I can't really take points away from them on this because there are SO many bands doing this exact same thing only 20 times worse(It Dies Today and Across Five Aprils come to mind).Fans of Norma Jean, The Bled, Evergreen Terrace, etc. will enjoy it."
4,Convicted,"This was an easy read. It is set up so that you can dive as deeply into the subject as you want to- based on how you use the reflections. For me, personally, I needed conviction and guidance in this area. And this book delivered it. This book highlighted how to apply the New Commandment in the way we speak to one another. It is so easy to get caught up in political issues and forget to genuinely love the people we discuss things with. So often we become so focused on making our point that we do things that are not loving or will unintentionally drive people further from God. This book reminds us to be gentle teachers and to love someone more than we love making our point and sharing our message."
2,Not as advertised...SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"This dog is very cute. But, it takes way too much work to get the thing to work. I had to rub the thing on the top of it's head so hard that it almost hurt my hand just to get it to respond. My 7 yr old daughter doesn't even have the power to get the thing to work like it's supposed to, and my 10 yr old daughter barely can. What a waste of money, and what a disappointment to my daughters. Just crazy!"
1,Don't Buy This!,My daughter was so excited about receiving this for Christmas and it didn't work! She was so disappointed!
2,sick little puppy,"I purchased this 'toy puppy' for my almost four year old daughter, who only wanted a puppy for Christmas, which turned into wanting a ""toy puppy"" when a nice Santa at the mall suggested maybe a toy rather than a real one. Anyway, had I bought this toy at the store, instead of through the mail (Shipping costs)I would have taken it back. It is very difficult to get the reactions from the toy as promised. It has only actually licked us once. We also purchased the 'Real brand newborn kittens"" They seem to work much easier for smaller children!"
3,Not what you might expect,"If you buy this CD because you know Lauri Porra from his time in Stratovarius or other metal bands, let me warn you, this is probably not what you are looking/hoping for. Instead, this is a collection of jazz numbers and a cover of his famous great grandfather, Jean Sibelius in ""Valse Triste"".I gave this three stars, although I feel a bit bad about it. I'm not really qualified to judge this genre of music. However I could barely manage to listen to the entire album once through, to me it sounds like the kind of music I hear in elevators or the doctor's office. To each his own."
5,Impossible to Pigeon-Hole,"The Chenilles are mostly known for their work on Prairie Home Companion. They're sort of contemporary folk artists, but then they aren't. They are storytellers of the highest caliber. So, where does this cd fall? It's big band music with a girl group. Not exactly folksy, but quite remarkable. These women have a range in style that defies definition.The songs are from the 20's to the 50's. They range in attitude from Sentimental Journey to The Codfish Ball. The harmonies are extraordinary. The arrangements are tight. James Dapogny's band is marvelous and needs to be recording more.If you're a fan of the Chenilles, get this cd. You won't be disappointed. If you like band music, get this cd. This is a great piece of work and I wish they'd record Whatcha Gonna Swing Tongiht II?"
3,NOT HIS BEST WORK.,Love his guitar work on his songs. But....this CD is not his best. It is not what you would expect from his previous CD's. He sounds tired. But....if you are a fan you will still buy it and listen to the songs. You will play the older CD's again to see the difference.
1,Huge Disappointment,"I totally agree with all the reviews who give this item three stars or less. The first cd I bought from Jimmy Thackery was ""Trouble Man"". If this had been the first, I probably would have taken him off my list of artist to purchase. Everything else I've heard or purchased by him is far better!"
2,Not for beginners,I'm a user of MS Project with experience putting together basic schedules. Don't use all of Projects capabilities. Purchased SureTrak as many larger clients use this or Primavera. Found it was very difficult to master SureTrak's commands. The book sent with software was for the most part useless. Book is written for those who already know the software not for a new user. As current client demanded SureTrak schedule was forced to hire scheduling consultant. This software was not designed to be user friendly. Discussed with others who have mastered SureTrak and everyone complains about the difficulties in finding work arounds in the software. Primavara / SureTrak do a great job marketing their software. They should put as much effort into their software designs. I knew going in this may be difficult but after spending many hours working with software am very disappointed. Not to mention there is a $600.00 program sitting on my hard drive that is mostly useless.
1,Impossible to use on ipad,"Just bought this for my iPad. Waste of money - no page numbers, so it's difficult to find specific recipes. Headings are undistinguishable from previous recipe, text just runs continuously. Very disappointed, although the content seems interesting."
5,good for price,"Absolutely worth the price! I can see and organize all my shoes the way I want. This is the only affordable organizer that fits this many shoes. It is a little unstable such that you shouldn't move it around, but once you decide where you want it, set it up there and you should be fine. Perfect b/c you can have flat or tilted shelve and as many shelves as you want. Works for boots of all sizes, high heels, and flats. Absolutely love it!"
5,Satisfaction Guaranteed,I am very satisfied with the shoe rack. It was very easy to put together and holds so many pairs of shoes. I am happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to a friend.
2,Not all its cracked up to be,It serves the purpose but it is very flimsy the more racks that you use. We have had to brace it to the wall to keep it from falling down. It would be nice if it were more sturdy and stable.
3,"good book for intro to buddhism, not neccesarily buddhist children","I am a little frustrated with this book because I think it glosses over the most important areas - discussion about the four encounters and the four noble truths is kept to one page, however his birth and childhood have 5? I'm all for stories that add some personal interest, but I think that they need to add some of the meat too, and this story is a little too light on actual Buddhism for my tastes. This book would probably be fine as an introduction to Buddhism for children who haven't had any experience with it, but for Buddhist children who are already familiar with the basic outline of the Buddha's life, it doesn't add much."
5,Female to Female USB adapter,"Exactly what I was looking for.... Fit my needs and is constructed well, I can recommend it to anyone in need of such an adapter"
3,My mistake - Not what I expected,"I was looking for a female-to-female connector which wouldreverse or switch the directions of the information flow.The product does a straight plug-to-plug transfer. Theproduct works as advertisedWhat I had hope to accomplish was to connect two deviceswith different plugs through the common USB (box ends).To do that, the female-to-female connector shouldswitch the direction of the information flow, rather than a straight connection.My mistake."
5,Works well,"I needed this to hook an iPod to my car stereo because of the backwards jack on the stereo. It worked fine, but then I found a correct cable with the ends I needed without requiring an adaptor."
1,CRAP!,doesn't work. never worked period. The price was right but I guess I got what I paid for....a nickel for nada!
1,"Wrong picture, wrong item","I ordered this based on the product photo, which shows two female connections. A waste of my time and money, and I still need to order the opposite kind and wait again."
3,USB Type A Female to Female Adapter,"USB Type A Female to Female Adapter, work fine for what I needed them for.And are for those times when you have cables, but wrong ends"
3,Inflated Customs Value Declaration,I bought this item for $0.40 delivered. Delivery took two weeks. The customs declaration on the back of the envelope says it is worth $10.00It is nothing special so it only gets three stars. It was cheap so I bought it to have around in case I can find it if I ever have a need of it. You put a signal in one side and I am assuming it will come out the other. Something that basic doesn't need five stars.
5,Female to female USB adapter,"Not much I can say about the item, if you need to connect two male USB cables this does the job and the price is reasonable."
5,"Perfect, just what I needed.","Perfect, just what I needed to extend my USB Phone cord to the house Wall charger plus I added another 4-foot USB cord with THIS adapter so I can stand up or set comfortably while talking and phone is charging at the same time."
1,it is junk,I got it after a few weeks. it did not work at all. I tried it with different computers and devices but no chance. this is junk Chinese stuff and is even shipped from China. so it takes a month to get it
5,A Must Have,A Must Have Item For Connecting 2 U.S.B Cables Together.Its A Item That You May Not Have A Use For It Now. For The Price It Good To Have One On Hand When You Need It.
3,work,"nice little tool does the job for what u need it for, free shipping and i didnt have to hit up radio shack"
5,love it,things like this are hard to find sometimes at the stores and i got them very cheap and quick.. love it
2,Didn't work as I planned,I was trying to connect my cannon printer with my iPad.And so I hooked it up and I'd didn't work. So I tryed to hook it up to different things and it didn't work. Am I doing something wrong or what? Well it took a month to ship. It seems to be good for traveling but it's not working. You get what you pay for
3,Ships from Hong Kong,Needed this item for a Christmas gift that requires one but one is not included so I ordered it in plenty of time for USA shipping but it ships from Hong Kong & will arrive in 2013 & not by Christmas as I originally thought it would. I wish Amazon would tell us Country of Shipping Origin so if we need it faster we can find a closer seller & avoid such hassles & in my case Embarrasment for an incomplete Electronic Christmas Gift.
4,Good,I did not try yet but it's coming on time. It's look ok and I am confident that its working good when I am trying .
4,Depressing At Times,"I give this book a 4 simply for the reason is well written and makes you think. I completed reading this book a few days ago, and it's still on my mind. That's a sign of good writing. I can't stay I like the book or the subject matter. I actually had to put the book down a couple time because the main character was an idiot and the prison life is too sad. However, I feel that the author deserved my completing this book. Interestingly enough, I have disliked all of his main characters in his serious works.Mr.Himes served 7 years, I believe, in the State Pen so he has a first hand knowledge of the workings of the prison and the mentalities of the inmates. I would highly recommend a reading of this book."
5,Well Written,"This is a well-written book that engages one in a cold world, a different perspective, in a non-judgmental, yet critical & analytical way, with a sympathetic overlay."
2,Tedious,"Himes is an excellent writer, but Yesterday was tedious. Pales in comparison to some of his other 'unfooled around with' works. Still a Himes fan, but Yesterday is not worth the eye strain."
5,Send a shiver down your spine!,"I came to Tobias Hill's writing through his novel, The Love of Stones - which is also excellent - and Skin was really just an impulse buy when I was in England this Christmas. Well, The Love of Stones may be good, but Skin wowed me. This is a collection of short stories - not my bedtime reading of preference - but don't let that put you off. A couple of the stories here are long enough to escape into, and really the collection as a whole is a minor classic. Hill gets under the skin of every character and place he writes about. Think you know London? Think again. Ditto LA and downtown Japan. Hill often relies on outsiders to get inside places - immigrant zoo workers, Vegas croupiers, late night drifters - and the leverage he gets with this device gains massive momentum from the quality of his writing. If you haven't read anything by Hill, this would be a great place to start - it just blew me away."
3,not suitable for a 3 year old...,"I purchased of these quads, one for my 2 year old amd one for my 3 year old. My 2 year old loves it and she fits on it great. My 3 year old on the other hand is to big for it. The box says 44 pounds and she weighs 30 and she can't fit. Meant more for 2 to 2 1/2 year olds."
3,Should have bought a bigger one,We bought this for my daughters 2nd birthday thinking she could zip around the yard on it but it moves super slow and the heavier she gets the slower it moves.
2,Don't waste your money!,THis is worth about $25 & is good fora 1yr to 1.5 yr old only.it barely moves and is made very cheap.Pay the extra and get a REAL Power Wheel Brand
1,Redefines 'reading between the lines',"This is one of the most confusing and discouraging physics textbooks I've ever read. Faber has an annoying habit of using symbols without properly defining what they are, or only defining them much later in the text, which leads to extreme confusion and frustration. Furthermore, he covers the topics in a wierd order, making it extremely hard to compartmentalise information, especially if you're a first-time reader (to fluid dynamics). What exasperated me most was the fact that Faber simply dumped equations on me without properly deriving them. Faber set out to write a comprehensive book on fluid dynamics for physicists, but in my opinion has come out short. Way short."
3,Weak,"Poor Justin, after this album came out and sold less barely 100,000 he was dropped by his label. Justin has a great voice, obviously he won 2nd place on AI 2. He should be given more credit and a chance at a 2nd album. But that's show business now adways. He could have made a much better record in my opinion. It's good, but does nothing for me. He shouldn't try to be the hiphop soul man. He's not that."
4,Unexpected Treasure,I was very pleased with this cd considering I didn't even know it was released! Most of the songs capture Justine's essence (the other ones I fast forward because they sound like Backstreet Boys songs!). I think that Justin's cd is surprisingly better than Clay's cd though it didn't have half the hype.
5,AWESOME,I love Justin's CD... It came in the mail on Saturday and already I have listened to it 3 times... I love every song. Looking forward to his next CD
5,THE BEST!!,"I WAITED FOR THIS CD TO COME OUT SINCE HE'S BEEN DONE WITH AMERICAN IDOL. I LOVE THE CD AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR ANOTHER ONE, AS FAR AS THE MOVIE, I WANNA SEE HIM IN A REGUALAR MOVIE, IT WAS OK, BUT FOCUS WAS TOO MUCH ON OTHER PEOPLE. HE'S THE ONE I WANNA SEE........HE'S GOT TALENT, WONDERFUL LOOKS AND ANYONE THAT DOESN'T CARE FOR HIM IS BASICALLY MISSING SOMETHING........I CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE"
4,Great CD...one for the collection.,"What ever happened to simply just enjoying the music? Some of you people out there reviewing this album talk as if you've written and produced multiple albums. Well, I don't have those credentials. My credentials consist of the following...if your feet don't stop tapping...your fingers don't stop snapping...then it must be good. Well...this album is good. Not one song is a disappointment. Don't take my word for it...buy it and you'll see what I'm talking about."
5,Unbelievable!,"This CD was nothing what I expected! I knew he was awesome, but WOW. Now I'm just trying to patiently wait for his movie! Get this CD, even if you ""sort of"" liked Justin, after this you will have all the respect and admiration for this wonderful talent :-)"
2,SORRY,"IM ""SORRY"" 4 BUYING THIS CD. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD BECAUSE IT GOT A GOOD REVIEW! IT IS SO BAD I PUT IT IN THE TRASH AND NOW I WANT MY MONEY BACK. I'M NO LONGER HIS FAN."
5,Better than I expected...,I just have to say that I bought this CD after hearing a sample of a song on Amazon. This is very enjoyable to listen to. Great addition to anyone's R&B collection.
5,Amazing Album!!,"Justin's CD is terrific! I'm knocked out at how great it is. Every song on the album is very good, and some songs are just outstanding. Justin does an awesome job on his debut CD. I haven't been this impressed with a CD (and I buy lots of music) in a long time. I simply cannot recommend this album highly enough, and would have given it 25 stars if I could. I've already purchased a few copies for friends. Way to go, Justin!!"
5,Justin's #1,"I think that his CD was worth the wait. It is amazing, I normally like to listening to classic rock and roll music, but when I first heard Justin sing on American Idol, I couldn't stop listening to him. He is great and his CD is the best. I listening to it at least three times a day."
5,Different than I thought,"This CD is alot more ""funky"" than I thought Justin would do. I thought he'd stick with more ballads that make the girls swoon. This turned out to be a great CD, though. The kind you listen to in your car and forget where you're going!!!"
3,Sad Ending,"Although he came in second place in american idol, he is still a phenomenal singer. Not to mention the guy has some of the greatest hair ever on American Idol. The cd is pretty good, I just think he could have had some better songs. Good album either way and definitely worth a listen to if not a buy."
2,What happened Justin?,"I liked Justin during the American Idol competition, because of his sweet soulfoul ballads, but now, eew. Is he trying to be hip hop and R & B cuz he certainly isn't! This change of sound doesn't suit him.And I blame it on RCA! They produced the albums and picked these horrible songs for him.I hope Justin gets another chance, so he could sing how he was meant to sing, how he sang on AI."
2,Just Okay,I was never impressed with Justin. He's just an okay singer to me. The Cd was pretty boring to me. He doesn't have a vocal range like Clay that's for sure. I believe Clay will go further than any of them. Kelly has an awesome voice also. Her Cd rocks. Clay all the way!
3,"There's no doubt that he has tallent, but what went wrong?","Justin Guarini's self-titled album sold 57,000 copies in its first week. Now, this isn't that bad, and sales could pick up. But something went wrong and sales got much worse. And in about a year Justin Guarini only sold 118,000 copies, which is truly a flop. Justin has a great voice but...1. One Heart Too Many 2.5/5 Extremely corny lyrics2. I Saw Your Face 2.5/5 Same problem as above3. Be a Heartbreaker 2/5 A painfully boring song4. Unchained Melody 3/5 Good effort from Justin5. Sorry 3/5 Another decent effort6. How Will You Know 3.5/5 The best song yet7. Inner Child 2.5/5 Good at first but it gets annoying8. Condition of My Heart 3.5/5 Pretty good9. Doin' Things (We're Not Supposed To) 3.5/5 Pretty good10. If You Wanna 3.5/5 Pretty typical but not bad11. Thinking Of You 3.5/5 Well its okay at best12. Get Here 3.5/5 Almost really good13. Timeless (duet with Kelly Clarkson)5/5 I love this song!"
5,Justin is fabulous!,"I had no doubt about Justin's voice,but was very happy with all the songs on the c.d. I think that Justin will be up there with Barbara Stiesand with his vocal range.Justin shows class in every thing he does and he will be one of the greatest stars."
2,"OK CD, Not As Bad As People Say.","After reading some of the reviews on the site I had to pick up this CD and see if it is really as bad as people wrote. I picked it up used and listened to it and I agree with many of you that there are aome REALLY poor song choices like ""Unchained Melody"" and a couple others. BUT there are some decent songs on there like ""I saw Your Face"" and others that really get lost by some of the poorer songs. This is an R&B album with the exception of about 3 songs so you should know that in advance if you were expecting a totally ""Pop"" album. It isn't, but there really really are about 5 five good songs if you can filter past the bad ones. If the other songs were as good I would have rated it much better."
2,I have mixed feelings on this album.,"First off let me say, this CD flopped terribly on the charts.And Justin is doing very good.The album is alright. There are some good songs, but Kelly's album is way better.My advice is, listen to samples online of this album, before you get it. I dont even want mine anymore, i am gonna sell it."
1,Didn't Kelly win a record-deal?,"How is it that Justin, second place in American Idol, got the same stuff Kelly did when she won? Well, Justin has proven his talent on this cd. Keep this in mind, Justin has sold 139,000 copies of his cd, while Ruben has sold a million, and Kelly/Clay have sold 2 million. Why 900,000 less?These songs are all, ""Girl... I want you to be my Girl...Girllll...."" Every song is the same and Justin has the absolute worst voice for this stuff. He simply does not have what it takes to be a singer. It may not be him, it may just be his material. The only thing is, the only good songs he has sung are ones made by other people. If he was truly a great artist he wouldn't just decide to give up as he is doing now. He should be out there writing his own music and not saying, ""The people who write my music are doing a bad job so I am giving up.""Justin's career is dead and this cd bombed. That should tell you something..."
2,Disappointing - expected better from an AI,"I don't watch American Idol, but it's supposed to have real talent on it. Justin was second best for the first year and so I figured his album would be pretty good. Fortunately, I got to hear it first before buying it. The store I go to lets you listen to the CDs before buying them.It was very disappointing. It's not terrible, but it's just not all that good. He sounds like a typical person you'd hear in a High School production ... someone with a bit of voice training. But his singing has little range and all the 'power' seemed to only come from amplification. I mean, someone like Barbara Streisand (sp?) or Bette Midler can really belt it out. Justin didn't seem to sing from his lungs and his singing isn't even all that pleasant.I wouldn't recommend this album. Maybe it's just the wrong type of music for him? Did he sing a different style on AI?"
1,pure drivel,"This album has weak vocals, poor song choices and does not even rate 1 star in my opinion. If Justin does make another album, I hope TPTB give him a higher grade of songs, with which he can showcase his voice, however mediocre it may be. I do not recommend this CD, unless you are a diehard Justin fan and don't care how lousy it is."
1,Kelly saves this album,"I'll admit, I was curious to listen to this CD. The ONLY reason I bought the album was for duet he does with Kelly Clarkson. Now there's a girl that can sing. (I bought her album and will continue to support her career.) Other than that, the only semi-decent song is ""I See Your Face"". This album debuted at #20 I think and very quickly fell to #80, and I believe it recently fell off the top 100 chart. A flop. Kelly definitely saved the album from being a complete failure."
2,Justin..,"I wasn't a big Justin fan, however I did find his CD in a giftbag. I decided to open it up and listen to some of the tunes. He has a good voice, but the music type is just not of my liking. My favorite song is ""Unchained Melody"" I didn't really care for any of the other songs, but oh well. Much luck to Justin. Where is he?"
1,HORRIBLE!,"This CD is terrible. It's so bad. On all the up-beat songs, there is way too much stuff going on in the background so the music overpowers his probably off-key voice. The slow songs are hard to take seriously, because you imagine him singing them, and then you imagine his nasty hair and that gross over-sized nose. I don't know, I didn't find Kelly's album great either, but maybe I'm just mad because the only real talent there's ever been on American Idol (Tamyra Gray) lost to one of the worst ""singers"" ever (Nikki). I can't wait for Tamyra's CD to come out so she can show both Justin and Kelly up. Tamyra's going to make them look so bad! I love the thought!"
2,SNORER!!!,"BORING!!!!!!!I am very disappointed with this album. I really hoped i would like it, but nope. ""Sorry"" is starting to grow on me, i think it could get descent radio play, and i absolutely LOVE ""Timeless"" starring Kelly Clarkson. Other than those two songs, i find the rest BORING!!!!!"
1,Flop!,"I am very glad this album is a flop. He is the most arrogant young man I have ever seen in my life. He almost killed a poor little girl by running over her with his watercraft, and then laughed about it! Shame on him. I think his career is over before it even started. NO talent = NO career. Goodbye Justin, we will not miss you."
1,William Hung's cd sold more copies...,"I think it's pretty telling when a CD by William Hung can sell more copies than your debut. Justin needs to just give up on his music career and try his hand at acting. Of course, he needs to stay clear of horrid movies like ""From Justin, To Kelly"" if he wants to be a star. This CD is so bad it's almost good."
1,I Bought This? Why???????,I can't believe that I bought this CD. I should have read the critiques on Amazon before I wasted my money. This CD is AWEFUL! I am in total disbelief that there are other people who like the CD. Either they are tone deaf or possibly members of Justin's family. I should have spent my money on Fantasia's CD instead. I can certainly understand why Justin lost his recording contract.
1,Yuck!,"This album stinks! It has no good songs and he is never on key!No one should buy this CD. If you really can handle the truth: Justin only made it into the top two on American Idol Season 1 because all the girls thought he was cute. Unlike Kelly and Tamyra, Justin had no talent;he just had looks. It's not like he even has good looks anyway. And that's what I have to say."
1,Truly Awful,"I thought I would be open minded and borrowed this CD from a friend. I thought it would certainly be better than he sang on American Idol 2. Was I ever wrong! I listened to it several times thinking it might grow on me. It didn't. It is amateurish and sounds like someone recorded him doing karaoke. Perhaps he just needs a different genre of music. You would think that Clive Davis could see this! And Kelly Clarkson didn't help him out on the duet--almost unintellgible lyrics, and it sounded like a cat fight! Screamfest city! If you want to be astounded at who can get a recording contract, buy this CD, otherwise save your money."
2,Something's missing,"Don't get me wrong, I love Justin but his cd just did not thrill me. I pre-ordered it and felt a little disappointed listening to it when it finally arrived days after its release date.. The background music drowns out Justin's sultry voice in many songs on his cd. I like to sing along to songs and the lyrics were not provided to me on the album jacket. Kelly Clarkson has the lyrics to her cd ""Thankful"" on her website instead of her album. The lyrics can not be found on Justin's website either."
1,Waste of money!!,I was suprised that Justin made it to the second place spot on American Idol. He is mediocre at best. I heard his cd at a friend's house and was so glad I did not waste my money. Justin does not have the talent to make it as a singer...the charts are telling the same story. Expect this cd to hit the bargin bin very soon.
5,Fantastic!,"I love this album. I was a little scared when i heard little samples from the album. But the song ""Sorry"" is great! I listen to that song all the time. I have Kelly Clarkson's cd also and they went in two totally different directions musically which is refreshing. ""I saw your face"" is one of those songs you can just close your eyes and just groove. I can listen to this cd all the way through without skipping tracks. Unlike Kelly's cd where I skip number 8 which is the duet with Tamyra Grey. (That song is a bunch of noise but anyways). I would recommend this album to anyone who has an open mind to music. And to all the people who don't like him, don't buy the damn album. No one is forcing you too. Thank you and good night!"
1,Justin Guarini,"This is one of the worst CD's I have listened too, ever! Justin could not carry a tune. Every song seems to remind me of the other, at times he sounds like a beloring cat. I don't think that I have ever listed to a worst rendition of ""You can reach me by airplane"", than Justin's. My only recommendation is that perhaps with many more years of vocal training, he just might have something worth listening to. Save your money or check-out the used CD section in the back of your local used CD store."
2,Don't Quit Your Day Job,"Although Justin Guarini has a ""Nice"" voice...this album was just a total miss. The R&B ballads and duet with Kelly Clarkson are the only things that make this album even worthy of music store shelves. The lyrics are mediocre and cheesy, and the vocal arrangement of the songs are sloppy and unprofessional. Not only is this album a critical failure, but it's failed to woe the so-called fans of Justin Guarini, considering it has been a commercial flop along with the co-released movie. Don't waste your time or your money."
1,"Boring...Sad, but True","Guarini knows how to milk an audience but this CD is one of the worst offerings in musical history. I expected so much better. The songs are mediocre or perhaps its Guarini himself who is mediocre. His version of ""Unchained Melody"" is lackluster and boring. So are the songs on this CD."
2,Justin Justin Justin where did you go wrong?,"I gave him that cause he is from close to my home town. This cd is pretty bad i think his head got pretty big being on that show, maybe as big as the hair on it. Althought will give him one thing did one of the best redentions of Al Green's soulful Let's Stay Together, why it did not go on his cd i will never understand. I think if it was not for Paula and the slew of pre pubscent female fans he would have been long gone."
2,A couple of good songs....but could be better,"Overall I think this CD misses the mark, there are a couple of good tracks (better than good actually) but the bulk of this CD is mediocre at best. Sorry, Timeless and one heart too many all sound relatively radio friendly, apart from that the songs sound overproduced and vaguely like they should be sung by someone else. It should guarantee a second effort, hopefully that will be more original."
3,MUST PURCHASE!!!,This CD is absolutely amazing!! The songs are beautiful and Justin's voice is so velvet smooth! My absolute favorite is Doin Things (We're Not Supposed To)! It is the sexiest song I've ever heard! You must run out and buy this! You won't be disappointed!
3,WHAT HAPPENED?!?!,"I must admit, I absolutely fell in love with Justin on American Idol, and I was eagerly looking forward to the release of his album. Quite frankly it is boring...this album showcases few of the many talents that Justin has as an artist. This record label did next to nothing to develop that. I know Justin has much more talent than this. I wish I could've listened to the album first before buying it. However, my favorite song on the album is the last one...the duet with Kelly Clarkson."
1,Yuck.,"I always preview albums before I decide to buy..well, I only heard a few tracks before I was screaming 'enough'!! I can't stand his voice and I was getting nauseous during previewing. I saw him on the show, he sounded okay there..what happened?? If I had this CD, I would be using it as a coaster. Thank god I didn't buy it. Don't waste your money, buy Kelly Clarkson's instead."
2,Boring.,"Okay, so he's got a good voice, but nothing too memorable or interesting. That being said, his album is boring. It seems like he just woke up, did a quick vocal warm up, realized how much he hated his material, then rolled through the lame, lackluster songs.Most of the AI kids suffer from poor material and the inability to sing with any true or well faked emotion, and Justin is no exception. One of the greatest songs ever written, ""Unchained Melody"", is performed with the interest and bravado of a tranquilized elephant.It's hard to get over the cheesy background music and the everlasting smarmy attitude that radiates through every track on this album. However, once you do, you realize, ""Hey, Justin's got a good voice. Not great, but good."" And if you play the album in the background, it's guaranteed never to interrupt conversations.If you like clear male voices, I'd highly suggest you seek out Michael Buble's self titled album instead of this rubbish."
2,So Disappointed,I was so looking forward to Justin's CD and was totally disappointed. I think what really blew it for me was the night that he was on AI2 singing Unchained Melody after Clay had sung it the night before. Perhaps if Justin's CD has come out earlier.....who knows
2,Material and artist not well-matched.,A few tracks are nice but most of the songs are ill-suited to Justin's thin tenor voice.
2,Very Generic Debut,I didn't care for this and I was a big fan of him on American Idol. I don't recommend it.
3,My Humble Opinion,"After reading the reviews and seeing the aI2 performance I was hesitant to buy this Cd, and of course wanting Kelly to win...but in light of that I was surprised, I found this CD to be good. Not exceptional, but good. It wasn't what I expected to hear from him but he did well. I would recommend this CD if you like R & B, it has the flavor of a Joe Cd to me. I think Kelly's CD was by far better. It showed more of her range and her ability to perform many styles of music whereas Justin's CD is all R&B. In it's own way, it is definetly worth the purchase."
1,Shoot me NOW!,UGH!... Time is definitely on Justin's side and I believe he will grow into an artist with a ton of creative energy. This debut album is more than passable and is a solid building block for the future. Give him a few years and he'll be one of those artists that others will want to be like.
5,"Got second place, but album is first.","I am a big Kelly Clarkson fan and I didnt really like Justin while on American Idol, but when I heard Timeless on tv, I REALLY like it, so on a whim, I bought his cd, and I have to say that I really like this album. There are a good amount of love songs, but they are all different, and I really like it. My favorite song on the album is ""Timeless"",number 13, which is his single w/ Kelly Clarkson. Obviously a winner.Great lyrics and meaning. My second favorite is ""Sorry"", number 5, this has a really funky beat, but is fun. He doesnt sing too many fast songs, and this is one of the rare, semi-fast tempo-ed songs. FUN FUN FUN. I would type about how much I like the rest, but all I have to say is that the songs are all very well done, and should be listened to several times, because liking will come with listening. ALL IN ALL.... A DEFINATE BUY. Worth your money."
1,The Boy Can't Sing,"Sorry, but during American Idol I thought he was a mediocre singer and I still think he is a mediocre singer. I saw him whining on some interview about how his CD did so poorly blaming it on poor promotion from the American Idol people - Give me a break! Your voice is nothing special. Maybe the American Idol people were too embarrassed to promote the CD. It pained me to hear him ruin the great song ""Unchained Melody"" live on American Idol when Clay gave such a moving performance. Justin, it is not the promotion that was the problem, it is your talent. Get a haircut, wipe that ridiculous smile off your face and get a real job."
2,Stop it with your five star ratings!,"This album is not flat out horrible, but it is DEFINITELY not worth five stars. Unchained Melody is one of my all-time favorite songs, but Justin destroyed the song for me. The truth is Justin should not have made it as far as he did on American Idol. Christina Christian, Tamyra Gray, Ejay Day, and RJ Helton all can outsing Justin any day. Unfortunately, they were eliminated from the competition while Justin cruised on by, and now we have to have him shoved in our faces. Well...not for much longer: I heard that he was dropped from RCA, his record label."
5,Justin's CD is awesome,"I was pleasantly surprised when I listened to justin guarini's debut CD. Rarely do you purchase a cd where you like all of the songs. I know some people may think that this CD includes a lot of cover songs but that is not the case. All except for two of the songs are original and are wonderful. My favorites are Sorry and Timeless, a duet with Kelly Clarkson. I highly recommend this CD for everyone."
1,Umm...no!,"He has an decent voice, i'll give him that. I've heard worse, believe me, but this album was awful. ""Unchained melody"" was so long and boring and it did seem like time went by slowly, ""Sorry"" was nice for a while, then it got boring and annoying, and ""Timeless"" is good, but only because Kelly sings in it. The rest are boring. ""Inner child"" is laughable. It's one of the worst songs i've heard, right up there with the hampsterdance and some other stupid songs. The lyrics in it are so bad that it's funny (""you gave me touchin' and lovin and took me to the moon""). But I guess it's not Justin's fault that the lyrics are bad. Oh well. I'm still blaming him for this bad CD."
1,SO BAD,"Wow.. this isn't even worth one star. You have got to be kidding. This is the WORST thing I have ever heard. It's stupid, cheesy, BAD SINGING. I laughed my way through all of it. What a flop. I can't believe he even got as far as he did on American Idol."
4,NOT BAD JUSTIN!!,"I give Justin credit for most improved. On the First season of AI he was just above average with a VERY scratchy high range. On this album he worked with such talent as Brian Mcknight who know how to bring out the best voice in you. Now he is a respectible singer and I respect him for it. If he keeps it up, he will only get better. GOOD JOB JUSTIN!!"
4,A Nice Debut,"Its very relaxing to listen to if your interested in listening to someone who can really sing (most artist now of days can't). The whole album is good except for mabey ""Inner Child""."
2,Hopelessly weird!,"This is Flannery O'Connor meets Igor Stravinsky with a cutting edge Barbra Streisand quality. I couldn't make any sense out of this music, in layman's terms. It's not exactly rock and roll, and it's not quite Samba, but it does have a hint of torch song. I guess I would describe this as a weird type of torch song CD, great for that karaoke sorority mixer with drinks and chips, but terrible if you're meeting the in-laws for the first time. They'll think you're the lunatic fringe, for sure! Don't buy this CD, unless you have the courage to self-validate your choice. The talent herein is contagious, contaminated and just plain wacko!!!! Please help Justin by not buying this! He needs a haircut."
1,"Give me a break, please.","I have not heard this album, but I heard enough of Justin's voice on American Idol to know that he is popular ONLY because the girls think he is hot. He has an incredibly thin, weak voice--I am still not sure what it even sounds like, since on AI, the music always overpowered his voice. A singing head is all Justin Guarini is. All of you who ""claim"" to like his singing, should admit what you really like: how he LOOKS while he is singing.Will there ever be a day again when the music in this country is actually based on TALENT, versus what the singer looks like?"
1,Take It Off The Rack And It's Wack Put It Back,"Actually, you might just want to toss this or make it into a coaster because you're not going to get anything if you try to sell it at a used CD shop. Amazon is selling Justin's Cd for .40 cents. Shoot, for .40 cents I could get a bag of Doritos and a box of Lemonheads! Anyway, this CD was boring: lame vocals over Casio keyboard beats. Justin has no style, personality, or sex appeal. He's just whatever. Now he's waiting tables. Oh well! Skip this at all costs!"
2,There was a reason he didn't win!,"I wanted Justin to win AI in 2002, but he lost to another future star! I guess there was a reason he lost. I just found the entire CD okay. There was only one song that I would give 5 stars to, and that song is SORRY. I know what I am sorry for, I'm sorry I had to listen to this album."
2,Skip him and go staight to Clay,"Skip this cd. If you want an A.I. runner up with talent, I suggest you get Clay Aiken's album, Bridge Over Troubled Water. There is a reason why Justin's Label dropped him because of poor sales."
2,Major disappointment,"I don't know what this is supposed to be. It's just really, really... not good at all. It's filled with boring, trite and just plain stupid songs with no personality whatsoever, and Justin's voice sounds rather ordinary. I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. I liked the other two American Idol's CDs though."
5,young,"Whoever said justin is young, is mistaken. He was 24 at the time I think. Kelly and the rest are young. Kelly and Clay Aiken are way awesome, and talented. Kelly won for a reason you know, that proves it there. I voted for her actually. She looks like my sis and has the same name. But Justin is awesome too, where is forever part of me, madness and his song at the end?"
4,kstamp,"I picked up this CD while browsing the music aisle at a warehouse club. I was impressed with Kelly Clarkson's CD and wanted to see what Ido runner-up, Justin, had to offer. As soon as I saw that ""Get Here"" was one of the tracks, I had to have it. I must admit, I haven't listened to the whole CD yet but Get Here is one of my all time favorite songs and Justin did not let me down! I am looking forward to Justin's videos and seeing what a choreographer/director can do with his natural ability to dance and entertain."
4,The Best of Justin,"The question is: Is it enough? the anser: Yes, it isHaving to follow the double platinum success of Kelly Clarksons ""Thankful"" I was sure Justin Guarini couldnt live up to it, but its great. this album had got to b one of the most soulful albums of the year. and this is stimulating to listen to. Unlike Kellys inconsistancy, Justin always sounds great and his voice has become 10 times better than it was on American Idol. If you appreciate good vocalists and want a male version of sade, cop this album."
4,Good for a debut album,"I admit I wasn't sure whether to buy the debut cd of Justin Guarini, I wasn't sure which direction he would go with it. But I brought it anyway and as soon as I heard the first song on the cd I knew I'd like it. It definately is an r&b influenced album, he has some good songs on it such as ""Condition of my heart"", ""Sorry"" and ""doing things we're not supposed to"".One of his weakers points on the cd is when he has to do uptempo's such as ""inner child"" and the Justin Timberlake sounding ""If you wanna"". But other than that definately worth the money."
2,Amazon purchase review,"Since a music sampler was not available I took a chance buying this product. I hoped the CD would include the hypnotic tango remix I have listened to in the radio (energy 99.7fm) but it did not, so it was disapointing. I would not recommend it to other people."
2,"Should be retitled ""Hot Air""","I found many questionable things in this book, like:1. Someone who's renovating their house is ""almost certainly attached"". Like singles don't do that, too?2. Saying ""I love you"" without meaning it is a ""harmless male fib"" for ""I want to sleep with you"". (this is where my relationship problems are - I can't read minds)3. You can remain friends with an ex ""if the split was mutual"". But what if, even in a mutual split, there was deception, abuse and/or manipulation involved? Do friends of the same sex treat each other this way? I believe a couple can remain friends after a breakup, but ONLY IF both parties played fair throughout the relationship, which is rarely the case. Usually, ""Let's be friends"" means ""I don't want to face the consequences of my behavior"".4. ""I'll call you"" is another ""harmless fib""...5. A size 12 is a ""cow"". Thanks, Tracey!"
1,"Paid for product, never recieved it nor did I get any follow-up e-mails","I never received my package, and when I tried to contact the seller, he or she refused to reply to my e-mails. I have yet to receive any feedback."
4,Be AWARE the fastener is a long METAL bolt that Protrudes out! Not ideal for Young children!,Its a good product. Its made of a heavy duty quality plastic. We purchased it for our Daughters bunny. It holds quite a bit. The one complaint we have is the fastener in the back SHOULD be made of the same hard plastic material the crock is made of! The METAL screw that protrudes out looks hideous and is DANGEROUS! So THE DESIGN DEFINITELY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT! Would be nice if it came in fashion colors!
4,Sooooooo Sweat!!! Ranma + Akane,"This is a great video! My friend recommended it to me because she said it is one of her fave ranma 1/2 videos. The first episode is about the school play, and lucky akane gets to be the lead. This episode is sooo funny! ranma, Kuno, and yes, HAPPOSAI have a battle to see which one of them can play the part as Romeo! It is totally funny and i would recommened it to everyone, exept for the second episode which has a lot of nudity(i could not believe it either)! Over all it is really great!"
5,Incorrectly Titled--but Rich in Taoist Philosophy and History,"For those seeking a deeper understanding of Taoist thought, practice, and philosophy outside of the Tao Teh Ching, this text is highly valuable. I've read it many times and enjoy its practical, lucid translation and depth of thought. The concepts rooted in this 2,000 year old document still hold very true today and offer a peace-time view of Taoist development.As an aside, the Shambala edition is entitled ""the Tao of Politics,"" which is not the original text's title. Students of Taoism may have heard of the ""Masters of Huainan / Masters of Hunan"" scrolls referenced in other Taoist works. Well, the Tao of Politics IS this text (or at least selected excerpts from the longer, original documents). I'm not sure why they renamed it (perhaps for marketing reasons). Aside from the title, this is a solid book.As always, Cleary delivers a strong, sensitive, and organic translation. This is a must-have for any warrior-sage."
3,Good Product--Some Shortcomings,"We use the DeLonghi Convection Oven every day and think it is great. However, the interior is not just difficult to clean, it is impossible! Also, it is just a little too small. We will definitely purchase another convection oven in the future, but will look for one a little larger with a self-cleaning interior."
2,what is the point,i dont see the point of microsoft inventing this . a portable screen that could attach to the system at least a 5 inch screen not a 2.7 controller screen and the fact that it is 99 dollars give me a break
3,Amazing Value!,"One of the coolest features of this product is the screen actually simulates a 62&quot; television screen that has be miniturized so that you can play it while driving your car. Unfortunately, your XBox remains the same size as a cinderblock. This product would be extra awesome if it was attached to a metal detector - then you could be like, boop! boop! I found some treasure! High Score!"
5,the best thing on xbox,it is the best thing on the xbox it is very good you can carry it around and play good one player games and you can also carry it on road trips.
2,Not bad for $30.00,"I bought this with the intent to play while someone else watches TV, or for road trips. However, it's just too small!! I tried it out with Project Gotham Racing 2, and while it did look decent, it was just too small, and I started to get a headache after about 20 minutes of playing, and I also noticed that I wasn't driving well AT ALL, it was really hard to see things until you are right on top of them!!!But, for $30, which is the same cost for a ""regular"" controller, it's not too bad at all.. I will probably end up getting the 7"" screen, or at least the 5.6"" screen at some point.. Like I said before, this one isn't too bad at all, but it needs to be bigger, I would have paid $50 or $75 for something that was at least 4 inches.."
3,THERE IS NO POINT,"...ok this is a great idea, but i think they should make the controller wireless, that would mean you could play anywhere (within a range), but other wise this is pretty awesome"
3,Some People...,"To correct the previous reviewer, this is *not* a Microsoft product. And $99 for a $20 controller and an $80 miniture LCD screen seems about right. Now of course no one would want to make this the primary monitor for their XBox. You're only going to see a fraction of the XBox's potent graphic potential on such a tiny screen. But, if there's a shortage of XBox compatible TVs in the house, or you like leaving the XBox in the living room and don't want to deprive everyone else of the TV while you play endless hours of Splinter Cell, this sounds like a handy little gadget."
5,Student`s review,"Excellent book featuring:* ""picturesque"" explaining (almost like a comic book), no clinical photography present though* step by step instructions how to do it, with every material, bur or other used instrument explained in detail. Detail is what is great about this book - you can reconstruct every phase of the procedure to the last detail.* fluidly written and easily understandable emphasizing the practice with all theoretical knowledge needed providedOverall it is a great book for students which want to get a general knowledge about practice and theory of fixed prosthodontics in dentistry. Great beginners and advanced user book. (My mother who is a specialist of prosthodontic find it useful after years and years of practice). Only complaint - there were not any real clinical cases and clinical photography."
5,Recommended by Medical Library Association.,"Recommended in ""A Basic List of Recommended Books and Journals for Support of Clinical Dentistry in a Nondental Library"" in Bulletin Of the Medical Library Association, July 1997."
1,"Lab tech book, not for a dentist/student",This book has very little clinical relevance. If you want to know how to process ceramic and gold crowns this is the book for you. I was seriously disapointed with this book.
1,This video is about 20 minutes long,"An extremely cheaply made, WAY TOO SHORT documentary that doesn't teach anything that you couldn't get by spending a couple of minutes online. A complete rip-off, for the close to 40 bucks I spent on it."
4,Awesome show!,This is a review for the Cleopatra Records version of this DVD. The four stars are for content and better packaging than the easily smashed jewel case version Visionary put out originally. This is a fantastic filmed for German TV live set from back in 1981. They play all the tracks you would expect. It was their heyday and even a semi hostile crowd depicted in audience shots are highly entertained. My only grippe with this product is a previous version I viewed before did not have the Buzzcocks logo lettering permanently displayed on screen from the start of the program to the finish. Halfway through I forgot it was there but early on I was quite annoyed.
3,dream theater practice technique,"I haven't bought this book, but I have practiced some of Jordan Rudess's techniques from other sources. The techniques are good practice. Of course if you want to be like Bach or Beethoven, you will have to go into much more extensive exercises. But if your into most Pop music then this book would be good for you. I tried the fingering exercises and it helped me tremendously. The techniques have opened up my creative side much more. I find myself trying more challenging fingering patterns now. In that it is a big accomplishment for me. If your intermediate or a beginner this book will help. If your advanced it may not be enough of a challenge. I consider myself intermediate, and I plan on buying this book."
4,Want More,"I ordered this Blu-ray accidentally thinking it was the complete 1st season of the series. The complete 1st season was released on DVD, but in Full Frame format only (much to my disappointment). Still it's nice to have some episodes to watch not only on Blu-Ray, but in widescreen format as well."
3,Iron Man Armored Adventures,"Unfortunately the disc appears to be scratched or marred - the third episode keeps stopping during play. I no longer have the information to contact the seller directly, since the order was a couple of weeks ago. Seller if you are reading this, please contact me. Thanks!"
4,A Comic on your TV,Ever sinceSpider-Man The New Animated Series: Season Onewas cancelled I've been waiting for another series with the same cell shaded look. This series fits the bill. The brilliant computer generated artwork looks like a comic book on your TV.The story is also closely related to the Spider-Man series from a couple years back: Tony Stark is in school and fighting crime on the side with a trusted friend and a girl who may or may not be his girlfriend.I was never a fan of Iron Man growing up so I never collected comics that featured him other than the occasional cross over. So most of the villains are new to me. Some who have been big fans of Iron Man may bring too much baggage to enjoy this re-imagining. I don't suffer from that so I really enjoy this series.My 3 year old son and I watch these all the time on Netflix streaming. Highly recommended for superhero fans of all ages.
2,Armchair Quarterbacking,"Dr. Epstein indeed delivers a scathing review of the state of social science supporting (or rather, failing to support) social service interventions in child protective services in the U.S. His point that researchers have been complicit in the failures of the service system by not asking or researching the ""true"" questions is an important one.However, the tone of this book is inflammatory rather than helpful. The author has plenty to criticize, but reports no real research of his own to counter his attacks on the current state of ""bulk cargo"" research. Fish or cut bait, Epstein."
1,this computer sucks!,i have been looking for a computer for about 2 weeks and almost all the ones i have found r more powerful then this computer and over half of them cost less! do not i repeat DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER IT [...] BUY A DIMENSION 4600 ATLEAST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT!!!!!!!!
2,DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER!!!,"On July, I replaced my P1 200 Mhz PC with a Dell Deminsion 2400. I got this PC for the Sims 2, but that PC was not powerful enough, so I had to go to Fry's Electronics to buy a new motherboard, etc.. Upgrading was not easy. Whatever you do, do not buy!! Get an XPS, or get a different brand."
3,It's just ok.,"The meditation concepts presented on this CD are good, however there is this swirling synthesized music on each track that I found annoying as it clashes with the verbal instruction."
4,A detailed figure - Essential for Lost fans,"A very detailed figure form MacFarlane toys. The base is Polyresin and its heavy and feels solid. I think the figure is some kind of plastic but it feels and looks good and not plasticky at all. The flag looks great and the overall appearence is very Hurley. The background is cardboard and has unfinished back, so it doesn't look great on a ledge where you can view from both sides. The cardboard is mounted on plastic supports that attaches to the base. I would advise care when assembling. The audio part is a black box that attaches to the base too via the plastic support and this is behind the background cardboard. Needs 2 AAs if I remember it right. There is a small push button that triggers the voice and there are 3 dialogs that play alternately. Attaching the figure to the base was difficult as the attach points are not proprly aligned. I broke the polyresin peg while trying to remove and reattach. Thats the only gripe I have about the product."
4,Good Northwest Album,"If you like rapper's from the Northwest and good one's at that, then this album won't dissapoint. Although it is kinda a short album, all the song's are good. I got lot's of Northwest rap album's in my collection from Cool Nutz, Kenny Mack, Maniac Lok, Bosko, GOTM, SYKO, Big Poohb & Young Willz, Majr D, Duna, G-Ism, Byrdie, Dividenz....Etc. And now I got this one and I like it. If you like good rap coming from the Northwest, this should be in your collection."
2,"light little pieces, fun but not too serious","Hough is definitely good to listen to, and this album is a collection of light little pieces that he can have some fun with. There are quite a few short pieces that are hard to find in other ""all time favorite"" collections."
2,"Has Highlights, But Overall: Boring","I've only read some ""Young Jedi Knight"" books, but I think this one was the worst. It didn't really have a complex plot and if you haven't read the books just before it (which I haven't), the beginning is pretty confusing. The books does have some highlights, but I'm wondering why suddenly everyone would find out there was this super-dangerous plague that could wipe out the Rebels, even though the others books (Zahn's, Rusch's, etc.) had evil Imperial commanders who could probably have discovered it. I'm not sorry I read it, but you have to get through lots of boring parts. Worth it if you are OBSESSED with the ""Young Jedi Knights"" but don't bother otherwise."
3,A suitable story arc end,"The Emperor's Plague closes up the second story arc in the Young Jedi Knights series, which saw a lot of change in the Star Wars political climate. Highly recommended, not just for the closure it will bring to the story, but for the enjoyment of the book itself."
4,Rio 800 128MG,"GREAT player if it worked. It comes with a rechargeable battery, which is the downfall if this product. Yes batteries do cost more but who cant buy batteries once in a while. the rechargeale battery never works, i've had to send my player back in twice since a got it. if not for the battery I would of given this player 5 stars. Has great sound, bunch of cool stuff; voice recorder, equlizer, backlight, ect. But it dosn't work that often. I would go with the rio 600, it uses regular batteries, plus has pretty much the same stuff as the rio 800 and its cheaper!"
5,Star,"A shining star of a book whose analysis of a minute topic illuminates the mysterious galaxy of human nature, psychology, and topophilia. Hirst has constructed a work of sheer genius, one which will inform generations of students of of the anthropological disciplines. The dedication to his daughter was nice too."
1,Alsons has been purchased by Delta - shower head not as depicted,"I ordered this Alsons head 2 years ago and it is a great head... all metal and solid construction. No plastic. However I just ordered it and received a head completely different from the one pictured and the one sent before from this same product page. The head sent was marked Delta and was all plastic. Upon speaking with the seller I found that Alsons was purchased by Delta at the end of 2011 and is no more.You can buy a Delta head at a fraction of the price of this head, which was priced for all metal construction. If you want all plastic, you can find a similar head in the $25-35 range.hope this helps."
2,Think BIG see *tiny*,"I thought this would be the best thing EVER.I wanted to play it 24/7.WANTED being the key word because after just 20 minutes of playing this ""high tech"" lil thing, My eyes watered and my neck hurt. The screen is to heavy so it weighs the front down and you have to fight to keep it up without hurting your fingers. Parents i wouldn't give this to your children younger than 10. On a ccount of it mught inpair thier vision.Im 13 and i thinki might need glasses just from playing it for about 45 minutes.Great idea and all,but no so well when u play it!"
1,MY EYES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh god help!!,"this product was pretty cool.....for about an hour or so but then my eyes got sore and still are i think im gonna be blind,I mean it is cool but they should have thought about the customers that tiny screen just kills your eyes...anyway i exchanged mine for the lcd screen for the ps2 its not so big either but its much more comfortable for my eyes."
3,a little some thing more,this controller screen should be made a little bigger so u can see what you are doing and so you looking at but outher wize it is realy cool.
3,Crashed after 5 minutes,This is such a great idea.I set the controller up per instructions.Used it for approximatly 5 minutes andthe screen went blank.Then I smelled burning...and that was the end.
5,PS1,"This would be more fun to use with a ps1. Does it work w/ one? I Don't own one, but it still might be better than the lcd screen. just a thought. gave it 5 stars cuz I think it's a good idea."
4,A Heart-tugging Nailbiter,"""His Only Son"" is a book that combines strong emotion and a twisty mystery into a read that's not to be missed. The story of a man and woman united when his son turns out to be her kidnapped child, it not only is moving, but a real pageturner when it comes to the intrigue element. There is a lot that needs to happen to make the romance believable in a situation like this, and Roberts pulls it off with ease. The dialogue is great, with banter that's thankfully based on real emotion instead of sniping and innuendo. Parts of the story are so honest and raw they're almost painful to read, but in the end, the reading experience is much more rewarding because we've come through it all with the characters. The rest of the Landry brothers are introduced in subtle ways that indicate Ms. Roberts has some interesting tales in store for us. A red hot start for a series that finds this favorite author in top form."
5,Kelsey Roberts is The Best!,Whew! I just finished this book for the second time and I loved it as much as the first! Nobody tells a story like Kelsey Roberts. A wonderful mystery and love story that made me cry. Her internet sight says the third Landry book won't be out until December. Oh no! Guess that means I'll be rereading this one a bunch more times until then. Thanks for the great book.
3,OK WITH AN INSIDE BAG,"It's a great filter if used with an inside bag. It will catch the fine dust. If you use it alone or with a garbage bag and a bag keeper, it will quickly fill up with stuff and have to be cleaned out. To clean it, you need to blow it with compressed air, making a huge cloud of dust. If you tap it as suggested you still get a huge mess of dust and it doesn't come clean. I tried it all three ways and decided to pay the price for the inside bag which catches most of the stuff being vacuumed."
4,"Recommended, but difficult to clean","Get one of these, How much are your lungs worth? The filter is good and strong. To clean it forget water, it just does not work. I wait for a windy day, put on a respirator, then bang it against a tree 100 or so times. I would be wonderful if it could be water washed, but water will not wet the media or the dust. This filter takes a lot of dust before air flow goes down significantly."
5,Excellent Filter!,Works so much better than the foam and paper filter that came with my shop vac. No more dust exhausting out of the vacuum even with fine dust such as drywall dust. I don't have to dust everything after using my shop vac anymore.
2,"Yes, it smells like gasoline","As other reviews mentioned, this filter does stink like gasoline. Using my Shop Vac (with this filter installed) in my basement, gives the entire basement a petroleum-like reek. I was going to return it to Amazon but first went and checked out the same filter at a local hardware store. Sure enough, the filter there smelled like gasoline too. I even checked out the other Shop Vac non-HEPA cartridges and those smelled the same as well.It is hard to believe that Shop Vac is unable to make a cartridge that does not smell this way. With that said, if you can ignore the smell, it works quite well!"
5,No More Dust,"So far, so good. I haven't used it enough yet to know if it will clog or not, and haven't cleaned up any plaster dust with it. I do know that my previous filter was in need of replacement, as I have much better airflow with theis new filter."
5,gas gauge,received it fast and a very resonable price! matches perfectly with the other gauges. could not be happier with this product..
4,She promised she'd stop this,"The 3rd book of the series. Her boy toy is dead, so she finds a new boy toy and of course turns him into a vampire, breaking her promise yet again to stop making vampires. Typical woman, can't keep a promise to a long dead God on Earth."
5,"Yes, But....","Yes, the ""historical"" info in this text is quite far-fetched, BUT the theoretical, philosophical and technical sections (basically MOST of the book, aside from a small section) are some of the absolute best I've ever seen in any book on Karate-Do. I am a Shodan in Shotokan and have found this book to have been VERY useful and applicable to my own practice in every way. HIGHLY reccomended (""historical"" info aside)."
1,I was there...,"I participated in the research for this publication in two continents, over two years and about 10 pints of blood and sweat. Hanshi funded it's publication through Yakuza-like business transactions. Technically, it's totally sound. The legitimacy of this book as a source of knowledge for the Martial Arts community cannot be disputed, but the master himself is just a man. I'm relieved that there is no reference to my name and exploits in this manual, as its inception will always be an embarrassment to me, and to karate in general."
2,Great info but reproductions FAR inferior to those in 1st HB edition,"WARNING: If what you are seeking is Darrah's heroic and indispensable scholarship -- his listing, for example, of several thousand (!) commercial stereographers active on the American scene in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, then this book is for you.But if you also value high quality reproductions of rare stereoviews from Darrah's own enormous collection, you will want to pass up on this reprint and get a copy of the first HB edition -- its faithfulness to the original stereoviews is FAR superior and even includes color plates.The illustrations in this reprint edition are severely degraded by comparison to those in the first edition."
3,"Hard to setup, uses lots of juice","I purchased this product to extend the range of wireless netwrok out onto the patio of my home (I work from home). The product works and once configured is reliable and serviceable device. This device is not for the novice. You must have some knowledge of networking inorder to integrate the device into your existing network. I fortunately had some, becuase the device is quite tricky to configure and Netgears web site is pure useless for help as was there product support site and telephone support.It also uses a good deal of power. I noticed the increase of my electric bill and now only have the devices plugged in when I need them. Which for me is 9 or 10 hours a day in early spring and fall before its hot or too cold.I would have rated this device higher 4 or 5 it was not such hassle to configure it."
3,Doesn't work as expected,"I bought two, one for me and another for a friend.I struggled for one whole day just to make it work! now it's working with me.My friend didn't manage to make it work.With it's price, I recomment buying another hotspot instead.Regards,"
1,If it doesn't work out of the box you're in trouble,"I didn't have any luck getting this item to work as advertised. It appears that if you get lucky and it works right out of the box then you are fine. However, if you need the instructions, they are vague at best.Get ready to call tech support."
2,bluetooth in-compatibility,"Buyers of the WGX102 series wall-plug range extenders should be aware of their incompatibility with Bluetooth and other wireless devices on 2.4GHz frequency. This can cause intermittent and chronic connectivity problems. In the words of Netgear tech support: ""For your concern if there is a way to set the WGX102 so it is isolated or shielded from the Bluetooth devices, to tell you honestly, there is no configuration to set on the NETGEAR device to avoid this frequency interference problem."""
2,good as a wifi extender but max speed is 14 mps,"I purchased the product to extended the range of my wifi especially when doors are closed. As a range extender it worked great but the product description says speed is 54 mps, but that is the speed of the wireless unit, the speed is actually 14 mps max due to the router until that is connected to your router. I needed more speed than that so I exchanged for the a/c wired 200 mps units which nets out to 80 mps at the receiving unit."
4,"really helps, but rate is limited","I couldn't get a decent wifi signal on half the house (which is, that's true, very large) and had terrible experience with wifi range extenders (never worked after nights spent on complicated setup) so I tried these range extenders.Well... it works. It's totally transparent for the network and it makes a pipe between your router and computer. I also have a third device from Netgear, theNETGEAR WGX102 54 Mbps Wall-Plugged Wireless Range Extenderthat allows me to get a decent wifi connection where I didn't get have it before.But there is no miracle : the bandwidth is about 500 KB/S best case (in my case) when transfering files. So it's impossible to use it for a media server for instance.But it's perfect for the web."
1,Useless even if it worked,"I had two problems with this wall plugged router:First, I spent 2 hours on the phone with technical support at the end of which tech support threw up their hands and said it must be my firewall.Second, tech support guy 1 and guy 2 both said, ""both devices must be plugged in to the same circuit"" that is, on the same electrical breaker, in order for it to work properly. In 95% of US homes each circuit covers 1 to 3 adjacent rooms, the area covered by a decent regular wireless router. If you need a range extender, the area you want to extend to is extremely unlikely to be on the same electrical circuit. Duh.If you read the reviews, it appears that many people have had good success with this device. My recomendation - if it fits your needs buy it, save the reciept and, if it's not up an running in 20 minutes, take it back."
1,Doesn't work as advertised - don't waste your money!,"After spending many hours on the phone with technicians, trying the on-line help and getting replacements sent (shipping at my expense) and then repeating the same procedure, I have not been able to get this product to work. Don't waste your time and money buying!I was able to configure the system with ease (many times!). I was able to connect wirelessly to the WGX102. I was able to see the WGX102 via another wired connection via my router, but could never see the router going through the WGX102. My power cicuit is new and fine - I was able to get good wire connectivity using two XE102s (while I had both the replacement and original). The technicians never tried to address the symptoms, just repeatedly went through variations on the reset procedure - a real nightmare! I now am left with a white elephant - too late to return after going through all this."
4,Excellent,"It worked literally straight out of the box. Plugged one unit to the ADSL Router/Hub down in the basement office (which does transmit wirelessly, but not strongly enough to penetrate the basement ceiling reliably), and the other unit upstairs, and there it was - instant wireless networking throughout the house where none was previously available. I was pretty impressed! On the heat issue... I think people's definition of ""hot"" varies a lot from one to another. I found it running no hotter than my least hot AC-DC adapter, which frankly to me is not particularly hot. More like warm. Perhaps Netgear improved this aspect in later releases.I did find a vast performance improvement (double= from plugging the units into a double adapter as opposed to directly to the wall. By all means plug the thing straight into the wall and avoid power boards/double adapapters, etc. It might still work, but you'll be compromising performance - possibly quite significantly!"
2,"Powerline ethernet works great, wireless no so","I bought this to run ethernet into my daughter's room. The powerline etherernet works flawlessly, I've had it up and running for six months without restart or problem into three other rooms. The wireless module however tends to overheat and drops the network after 24-48 hours of operation, so she has to unplug it every time she is done with the network, and plugs it back in whenever she wants to connect. I am going to upgrade her to another wired powerline ethernet module."
3,First One Failed in 30 days...,"The WGXB102 is very easy to use out of the box. However, if you want to secure the network and change the supplied configuration, you have to jump through some hoops (like changing a computer's IP to be a specific IP that can access the admin console). After jumping through the hoops, I was not able secure the network and still access it. Could've been my problem. However, after working fine for 30 days in a less secure configuration, The extender appeared to die on me. The led's began to flicker like the wiring was fried and then they went out, and connection was lost. I returned it and got a new one. Plugged into the same outlets, it's working fine in default configuration. I'm not sure if I'll keep it or not, at this point, since the first exchange was a hassle, and I don't want to get stuck with bad hardware if it happens again."
1,finicky and limited,"After hours of trying, including hired tech expert help PLUS an electrician to hard-wire a special outlet, we think the poorly written manual explaining installation with a non-Netgear router (ours happens to be Linksys) is misleading. The writing is confusing and the results predicted are just plain wrong. We give up! We ordered a Linksys Extender today to try to match our router, and now we are trying to figure out how to return the Netgear WBXB102 to get it out of our lives forever. A failure experience all around, an expensive one, too. Trying to be fair, and not just bitter, maybe this could have worked just fine with a Netgear router?? We chose to move on in a different direction."
1,Gave up,"I spent hours trying to get this to work. I am usually pretty good at these things, but I finally gave up and sent it back."
2,Netgear Wireless Extender Kit,"Simple product with too complex of a setup procedure. Standard setup assumes you have NO wireless network security in place. At a minimum, it should be plug-and-play with at least WEP or WPA-PSK security in place."
2,Wouldn't work,"Worked with the tech guys for over three hours each of two separate days but couldn't make wireless range finder connect securely to my home network. In the end, the tech guys quit, just couldn't figure out why the configuration wouldn't work. I knew there had been problems for other buyers for the same reason when I bought it but thought I'd be able to figure out the network configuration issues with a little work. I was wrong. Even the technicians at NETGEAR couldn't figure it out remotely. I returned the product for a full refund after three days and that went very smoothly. Thanks AMAZON for promising good customer service and delivering it."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I found this product to be an exercise in frustration. Terrible waste of time, and flushed the cash. Too bad, as I still have to buy another product to do the job. I thought that maybe I did something wrong, but then in trying to fix it, found that many others were having the same problem. I never could get it working right and tried to reinstall it each time I traveled home wasting precious time I should have been relaxing. I tried calling the customer service line, but they succeeded in having me reset my computer so that I couldn't log on to ANY wi-fi networks. It took me a while to unravel that mess, as I am not a techie. I found the customer service people to be haughty and condescending. They are glad to get our dollars, but seem like they feel they should provide nothing in exchange for them."
4,Worth buying,"This product has helped w/ my wireless connection which was virtually nonexistent before I bought the extender. Main drawback is that I have to restart my computer every time I move to different rooms of the house, move the extender to the room where I am working."
4,Good for access - would like more speed,"The set performs as advertised. You plug one next to the router or modem and the other in some other electrical outlet. I actually have bough 2 sets, one for my office and another one at home, so that my wife can ""chase around"" my daugther and have access to work from home. The actual speed is around 11 MBPS, so that skype and other bandwith intensive applications might suffer a bit. For browsing, email and alike, it is a great help."
2,Simple to Connect?,"I tried to add this to my secured Netgear network without any luck. If you don't know how to ""ping"" your computer and change your ""LAN settings"", watch out. I can't really blame the people who tried to help me with this problem. I think the combination of poor product information, non-user friendly technology and overseas phone response delays made this a terribly frustrating experience. I suppose if you have a laptop the set up might be easier."
4,Good. Expands Wireless network well.,"Pretty cool the way it uses your existing electrical wiring to extend your wireless network. A few times, i have wished it had an ethernet port on the wireless transceiver unit so i cd also plug in a non-wireless computer. But this item was not built that way, so it's not like I'm getting gypped or anything. Does extend my wireless network really well."
1,This is not a good product,"This is not a good product, as it did not work in my apartment, despite trying everything possible, as per the instructions in the box. I already have a netgear wireless router and a DSL Cable modem. The range extender did not function , and infact it made the original internet wireless signal strength deteriorate.i would not recommend buying this product."
5,Great for online gaming!,"I had many problems playing online games (Internet Poker) with drop-outs and slow/low connection using Linksys wireless-G router. Router is upstairs, PC is downstairs. Tried High Gain antennas with no significant change. Finally installed the NetGear WGXB102 and system works great. Also greatly improved laptop perfomance from anywhere downstairs. Still use the Linksys Router and every thing is completely compatible. Very satisfied customer."
1,Disappointed,"My SMC Barricade router is on the first floor, my new office is on the second. The wireless signal is too weak to be useable and I do not want to pay an electrician to install a new fixed port in the wall.I had every hope that the wall-plugged WGXB102 device would extend my existing wireless setup. Unfortunately, after about six hours and two phones calls to technicians in Indian with very 'tick' accents, I could not get the WGX to function. For some reason, I could not connect to the Internet, despite following the instructions and tinkering with the settings.FYI, to reset the device, you have to stick a paper clip into the reset hole and hold it for about 15 seconds, which is easier if the device is plugged-in upside down. Not the best design."
3,"Does what it needs to, but don't expect any speed","I live in an older house with plaster walls and my regular wireless network does not make it more than two rooms before the signal gets weak. Setup is easy, but do NOT use an extension cord or power strip. It is very sensitive to this. Also do not expect great speed. My download speed is less than 1/2 what I get on my regular wireless network. But its easy to set up additional a/p."
1,Broken Like so many others...,"Like many other people, I liked this product up until 4 months when the reciver failed.. middle light stays lit and the other two nada... talk to tech support going thru loops only for them to tell you what you already googled.. middle light lit others nada.. BROKEN. I have had razors last longer than this.. use google and find that this happens to most people sooner or later..."
1,Great in Theory but falls way too short.,When I got this product i thought great now i can get my router to reach my room in the apartment. I was thrilled of the idea of the signal going through the power cords. What I didn't realize is that this thing can really only send the signal to adjacent rooms... If your lucky.The signal wasn't even strong enough to go into the room below it. I have no clue how powerful the wireless strength was but it didn't make a difference for me in any outlets where it could communicate with the other half. If you have a wireless router that can't even push the signal through a wall or a wire router that you want to make wireless then this might be a good buy. Otherwise avoid it.
3,Easy and damn difficult,"Setting these two units up was as easy as plugging the two units into wall plugs and connecting the master unit to my router. Easy.Configuring the suckers to make the wireless network secure is not intuitive and not for the weak of heart.I still have not been able to configure the laptop that will be connecting to the WGX102 unit.After I registered the products, I contacted tech support for some help. I received an e-mail with a link to their site for my response. The site rejected my password. I used the Lost Password link and received a cheery message my password has been sent. It has been 24 hours with several attempts, and no password. And you cannot access any information until the site accepts your password. Makes one wonder if they really offer help or only tease you into thinking they can help you."
4,Great once you get it working,"The quick install instructions did not work. Not only are the instructions poorly written, they just did not work. I had to use the CD ROM software to get it working. Its been working perfectly after the 40 or so minutes it took to do the initial setup."
1,Save your money and sanity,I purchased this to save space while also connecting my new DVD player to my old TV. It required a PhD in engineering to set up and stopped working completely after a few months. Save your money and avoid this product.
1,Do not buy,This product absolutely does not work. There is a constant buzz in the audio and the video has bright streaks going through everything. Heed the advice of all of the reviews on this product and get something else.
1,Very poor performance,"This modulator is a waste of money and is junk. The loud, distracting hum is annoying and the picture quality is very poor.I tried it on two tv's (one quite new) and two dvd players and found the same results on both. Spend the money and get a good one."
1,One big problem,"I bought this modulator to use with the old TV in my bedroom and to use with the TV at work. The performance at work is awful, and the performance at home is somewhat better than awful.At work, the static/buzzing drowns out the audio. At home, the static is intermittent, and therefore only hugely annoying. Pay the extra money for a good one."
5,Not so Common Sense,Excellent life changing book.It seems so simple when you read it but the results are profound.xj
4,Works great,"Works as expected. It is rather heavy, but its a transformer. Wish they could be lighter though."
3,Easy to assemble. Cats were a little afraid of the height,Easy to assemble. Cats were a little afraid of the height. They go in the little cubbyhole part of it though
3,Cats love it but falling apart.,"By cats absolutely adore this tower. However, I've had it for 3 months and already it is falling appart. My cats do jump on it a lot and it gets lots of use."
3,"For smaller, lightweight felines only.","It's a little rickety, and I expected that due to some of the reviews. This cat tree was the right height for our elderly cats and the only one with two cradles, which they really like. The screws included are too small for the job; I recommend using larger ones. I haven't figured out how to stabilize the poles better; cats are too afraid to sit at the top platform because it's shaky. What's with the extra carpeted piece? It's supposed to act as a tunnel at the bottom but it's not secured in any way so maybe kittens wouldn't be afraid of it moving but my scaredy cats are."
1,Horrible peice of garbage. One start is too many,"If you could give negative stars this would be the product. Fell apart while assembling and first time cat jumped on it, the tunnel fell off. DO NOT BUY!"
1,Poorly constructed,"As other negative reviews have stated, this product is very poorly constructed. My biggest complaint is that the vertical posts are essentially cardboard tubes with threaded plastic inserts that allow them to be connected. Properly tightening the posts to the base and connecting the mid-level perch isn't feasible. The end result is that the unit is very wobbly despite my best efforts to stabilize it. We've had the unit for only 5 weeks and it is almost too unstable for our 5 pound Ragdoll kitten to use. Save yourself some frustration and pay the extra money for a better unit."
3,Cute but small,"This is really a nice looking cat tree. The sheepskin- like fabric is nice and cozy. I like it better than carpet or fleece. I bought this for my adult cats to use. They are 17 pounds, 14 pounds and 12 pounds. There is no way any of these guys would fit in that little bed. And the platforms are really not big enought either. I also take care of foster kittens for the local shelter, this is perfect for them. I have two fosters right now and they absolutely love this tree. The toys are fun, the ladder is being used and the bed is always full of one or both kittens. So just consider the size of your cat before buying this. Kittens and smaller cats would be fine, but big cats not so much.So on to my search for one for the big guys. Finding a bigger sturdy tree that doesn't break the bank is a challenge."
1,Problematic,We made the mistake of going for something that looked fun instead of something with good reviews. The anchor points for the posts have broken repeatedly. Now the cats are afraid to jump to the higher levels. Posts that fall over miss the point.
2,Mediocre,"Although the materials on this tree are decent, it is VERY unstable. The top perch is wobbly and when our cats try and jump down, the entire tree comes dangerously close to toppling over. I would advise spending more money for a better piece of cat furniture."
5,Very Cool Cat Tree!,"Cat tree came Fed Ex and they were nice enough to leave it at my back door (I was home at the time, so I would have answered anyway). Very heavy box, but easy to open box and I just carried the parts into another room to assemble. Easy assemble directions if you've ever put anything by LEGO together. Parts list was wasy to understand and all parts plus extras were included. Took me 45 mins to assemble and stand up, as directions and parts make top down building necessary. Carpeting is soft and the sisal is a scratching post hit. My cats are crazy for this tree! They kept trying to play with it as I was assembling it. They love the lvls and the little house on top. Highly recommend this piece for those who want a good structure at a not so high price."
1,My opinion,"I returned this condo. It was wobbly, perhaps because it was so tall. I feared the cat might be injured by a fall from it."
5,Cat playhouse paradise,"This is a great condo tree for playful cats. More fun if you have 2 cats like i do, they have great fun trying to spy on each other from the different levels. They run and jump to the 2nd & 3rd floors with ease. The instructions to put together are those minimal kind, with a drawing of the finished products with numbers pointing to the order that parts should be put together. Not very clear on a couple steps but i figured them out. Also a little shaky on carpeting, ok if you rest it against a wall for stability. Hardwood floor might be best. Had it only a few days as of this review and the hours of entertainment and laughter it provides watching your babies playing is well worth the cost. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,"Nice knives for the price, but not made in Germany","I already have a nice set of Henckels Four Star knives, so I ordered these knives just to see what they were for this low price. They are good looking knives that are well made. The chef's knife blade is quite large and the packaging calls them ""Commercial"" knives. Blade size is similar to some Forschner commercial knives I have used. The knives say the same thing that the German-made Henckels knives do (about Fridour ice hardened and such), but they are made in Spain. That explains the low price and the set is labeled as a ""Gift Set"".Low rating (rather than 5 stars) is because of the misleading product description. I would still recommend this set for anyone looking for quality knives at a very reasonable price. You can never have too many good cooking knives."
5,Very nice set,I've had this set for about one week and love them. I threw my other knives out. I am planning on getting more. They slice through everything with no effort. I didn't realize how bad my knives were until I used this set. Very happy!
3,Henkels Not What They Used To Be,"I bought this set because I wanted an additional knife to cut salad with. I already owned a set of Henkels knives, 4 star, I think. Well honey, these are not your mama's Henkels.My old Henkels were made in Germany. These are made in Spain. There is a world of difference in the quality of the old and new knives. The new are not near as attractive. They are much lighter, and the blades are not even as well edged. In fact, brand new, I don't think they are even as sharp as the old ones were when they were brand new.Okay, all criticism aside, these are bargain priced. For someone starting out, they would be a very good value. I think compared to the cheaper discount store cutlery, they would probably last a lot longer.So, if you are just starting out and want something that works, that you probably won't have to replace for a while, this is it. If you are looking for the old Henkels, this isn't it."
4,very happy,I love my new knives. Did not want to spend alot on them right after Christmas and these took care of my problem. Worth every penny.
3,"Nice Blades, bad balance and handles","Thank goodness the quality of the blade is good, or this would have been a 2-star or worse review. For $30 though, it's really a pretty good deal. The handles feel cheap, and the paring knife is terribly light. Only redeeming qualities are the blades, and the price."
1,Not what I expected from Henckels.,"I have returned this product.These were very cheaply made and I am disappointed that Henckels would put out something this poorly made.The handles are light-weight, molded plastic. The blades are cheap steel, not up to par with most Henckel items I have seen.I knew I was buying a cheap set of knives but I guess I put too much stock in the name, assuming it would be better than it sounded.I returned these for a FAR superior set by Calphalon that didn't cost much more than these blades."
5,Gr8,One of the best movies of Jackie Chan. He is the only who combined Action with comedy and presented among us and was most successful in his career.A must watch movie of all time. Grab 1 !!!!!
4,Cheesy Goodness,"Jackie Chan in argyle socks, bad dubbing, a massively inept Chinese navy, corrupts cops in Hong Kong circa 1900, and Chan's signature stunts and humor create a highly entertaining (although not always comprehensible) farce. Chan starts off as a sailor in a navy that isn't capable of navigating its way in a bathtub. Not surprisingly, they fail to catch Lo Sam Pao, the pirate 'Lord of the Seas.' The sailors are turned into cops, Chan gets in trouble for doing his job arresting gangsters and busting up night clubs, and participates in the clever and humorous fight-stunts Chan is famous for. The bicycle pursuit in narrow alleys is particularly entertaining. Eventually he winds up in disguise on Sam Pao's island to rescue the hostages and defeat the pirates. The pirates are as schlocky as anything Hollywood dreamed up, but the sight of junks attacking a barkentine is refreshingly different from the usual Hollywood fare. ~M. Kei, author ofThe Sallee Rovers (Pirates of the Narrow Seas)"
2,Hard to Tell how good it might have been,"It was difficult to tell as the dvd's were not secure, or were jostled somehow, out of the disc holder in package. The discs were shaking in unopened package. There were some scratches from the discs moving against one another and many scenes were difficult to see or hear.I think this might have been a good collection, but too difficult to watch.Sorry."
5,This is an extremely powerful book,"If you can get your hands on this book I strongly recommend it. The author goes into many different areas of mind exploration including healing yourself and others with your mind. All aspects of your life can be improved by ""going within."" This is a fantastic book that should be in print. This book has nothing in common whatsoever with the Celestine Prophecies which I did not care for."
5,Probably the Best Introduction to the Period,"While somewhat dated, this is probably the best introduction to the period. I use the word ""probably,"" because I am not an expert on Early Modern England, and therefore I do not know the entire literature available. What I can say, though, is that Russell's work is magnificantly written. The presentation of ideas is crystal clear and the writing is emotive and witty. In short, its a page turner (for a history nut). The glossary is incomplete but very helpful, and the revised bibiographic essay brings the reader closer (1988) to the contemporary historical debates. Having effortlessly read this book, I can easily engage more specilized studies of the period, like Russell's equally reccommended (though for different reasons) ""The Fall of the British Monarchies 1637-1642,"" or Jonathan Scott's ""England's Troubles."""
2,"Great book, but not without the illustrations",I enjoyed this book but the new edition does not contain the color plates from the first edition. Why? The illustrations are wonderful and add so much to the text. Without them the book's value to a reader is seriously diminished.
3,"Informative, but lack of original colour plates is irksome.","Informative and interesting. Some early ""knitting recipes"" are reproduced.My main complaints:1) The dust jacket states that colour plates are included, but there are no colour plates in this book. I suspect that the plates were reprinted as black and white photos that are scattered throughout the text.2) The text was not edited to accomodate the lack of colour plates. An example is when the author refers to ""figure 7"" for Charles I's light blue shirt. The figure number does not correspond to the image! The image *is* there however, but you have to look it up in the index to find it, and it is reproduced in black and white only."
4,Reliable reference,"Not a book to read straight through, for entertainment, A History of Handknitting is a well-researched reference to , well, the history of knitting. Few people know, for example, that the sweater is a very new garment style (only about 100 years old) and was designed for and by people who made a living by fishing. Gloves, on the other hand, are quite old. As a museum educator in the field of textiles, I find this work very valuable."
4,He draws no conclusions ...,"It is, alas, the reprinting which means the plates are black and white, not in color. I'll keep my eyes open for the original printing, but don't plan on mortgaging the house to get it. This is the bible for knitting historians. I can see why. He draws no conclusions, but presents an exhaustive review of knitting through the ages. He takes extant pieces, dates and analyzes them, he delves into other people's work and analyzes it, too. I've skimmed it a couple of times, and looked at the pictures several more times. But, like most of us I think, I have never read it cover to cover. Until now. I'm impressed. I'm educated. I'm inspired. Can't really ask for more than that, now can I?"
2,U.S. Troops Vs Taliban Vs Giant Worms,"Like many said, it's like tremors. Going straight to the point, there's a lot of bad acting and really bad script to follow. I found the action very lacking because I wanted to see more monster-related action. However, being obviously low budget, the worms are just there for show, you don't ever see one truly explode or any cool, epic, or memorable scenes. They were decently created, but again, it's just there for show.There were no truly suspenseful moments in this movie that put me somewhat close to the edge of my seat, second guessing what might happen. Soldiers got worm issues, finally got helped and got out of there. The movie had a boring, too straight forward storyline without any real twist, it ran a typical hour and a half, only a handful of people survived in the end, usually that's about 1-3 as the typical number. Bored me, will not watch again."
3,Sand Serpents,"I enjoy this type movie. Reminds me of all the SciFi movies that came out in the 1930s-1950s. They may not be overly well acted, but they are certainly entertaining to watch. Even classics like Frankenstein never got rave reviews from the critics. So I expect them to turn noses up at this one. If you enjoy SciFi movies about giant monsters you will probably find this worth watching. Rent it and then you can decide if it is worth buying. I think the current price is reasonable for the story, casting, directing, special effects, and music. if you enjoyed this, catchRaptor IslandCA Luster"
3,Tremors in the Afghan desert,"The other reviewers nailed it pretty well. The ending of this movie brought up my opinion of this flick. When you watch this movie, look for a large truck in the background that is not supposed to be there,I guess the editor was asleep at the helm. This movie is a good value if you buy the triple feature set that is now available. This set included, Wyvern, Sand Serpents, and Carny, takes the sting out of the price."
3,"Much to like, could have been better","The acting and special effects are a notch above the usual RHI production on Sand Serpents. I found the Sand Serpents to be very realistic looking, perhaps because underground creatures don't need a lot of detail and color. However, the film sagged at points where characters bickered while waiting to be attacked. Perhaps a little humor would have helped. By the way, Jason Gedrick was actually quite good as a weary, on-edge soldier."
2,"The Serpents are good, but the rest....","Could have been good, with a more detailed script, better director and betteractors/actresses. Except for one or two, the squadron looked like a bunch ofactors/actresses in costumes. Did they do any basic training for the film ?Even when the taliban attacked there was so sense of excitement.Ive see a lot worse, but in this movie they could have done a lot better.Lots of shooting, and you see no sand serpents....low budget ??But when the sand serpents do show up...they are good....but hey a better scriptcould have been even better for the serpents. The movies Tremors, knew how tohandled the worms and also infused a bit of comedy that worked.Does'nt look like they tried to hard here...they just follow the script to the end.So yes, i like the sand serpends but the rest did'nt work too good.Keep the cgi sand serpent creator...fire the rest.Good for a view....thats about it."
1,My ears hurt!,"These dirtbags that name their crappy cover band things like ""The Original Artists"" in order to trick people into buying their CDs should be executed."
4,A Good Choice to ADD to Your Books on Polish,"In short, I have used 3 books in the Routledge series (Polish, Slovak, and Czech) and they are all fairly good - not great. A four star choice for $30.The Polish book was a very helpful beginning for me with the language. For less time and money than it takes to drive to one college class, you can learn a great deal.Many people, including me, find that Routledge does not organize these books particularly well. e.g. The index is so-so and does not provide page references - only chapter references; however the chapter numbers are not printed on each page, so it becomes a bit of a treasure hunt each time one wishes to find a topic e.g. superlatives, perfect tense."
2,A confusing way to learn a language,"This book is ok if you're a tourist wanting to learn some quick phrases or if you have a prior knowledge of the polish language, but if you actually want to learn and understand the language then this book is not for you. It starts off with a dialogue, but they don't tell you the meaning of any of the words. It tells you a phrase and has it's english equivalent, it may be used the same way but if you look up the words in a dictionary, not a single word is the same as in the english equivalent. I like to be told what it really means. Plus the layout of the book is confusing and takes some getting used to. Overall this book was not worth the money."
2,No wonder the book is so inexpensive,"Copyright 1972...should be 1772. The illustrations are Old World sketches at best. If you want a VERY brief overview of tools and processes, this book should do. Although for being a basic and introductory book, it assumes you know some terms which can be frustrating. Probably a good guide if you're taking a course and want to refer to very basic tools and processes. Presentation is definitely ""old school""."
4,It's not a bad idea book,"If you know the basics of working with silver, it's worth the $10 to add this book to your shelf. This, like most Dover books, is a low cost idea book. It is well illustrated with sketches and chock full of project ideas. It's not a perfect book, but it's a great book to get ideas for silversmithing projects.The format is to present a project sketch and how to make it on facing pages. The projects include pitchers, trays, and cups along with some misc projects like napkin clips. There is also an appendix full of thumbnail sketches of various other project ideas."
1,It encourages diapers,"The video is very short. Somewhat a 70's or early 80's style. It shows the girl getting her diaper changed often and how ""happy"" she is about it. The video is extremely short so don't expect a ""movie"". It's just 2 songs. I plan to resell mine -- it made my daughter and my neighbor's daughter go *back* into diapers. I was mortified how this video makes diapers look so ""cool""."
2,The Potty Movie for Girls: Hannah Edtion,I bought this for my niece and my sister wasn't impressed with it. She says this is for more older girls.
4,not bad,"This is probably my favorite of the potty training dvds we have watched. The illustrations are cute and the show moves fast enough to keep the attention of our two year olds. It's somewhat repetitive with scenes being shown multiple times but that's okay. Most of the focus is on being a ""big kid"" and what big kids do. The going potty section is pretty brief, and only slightly longer than all the other things ""big kids do"". But overall it's a cute show, with terms that match the ones we use and it's nice to have it be little girl specific. I'm glad I bought it."
3,Not my favorite video to watch with my baby,"Bought this video to encourage my 16 months old daughter to start using potty. Unlike other videos, both of us don't seem to be interested in watching the video very often. The voice of Hannah sounds weird, not quite sure it is a sound of a male or a female and sounds no innocence of a young child. Hearing the voice of Hannah bothers me a lot. The tone sounds very flat, like ""Hannah"" is reading the script.The music is catchy but the song is boring. I cannot bare to listen to it more than 3 times."
2,okay,"This potty video is cute, but repetitive, and my daughter lost interest in it very quickly. She just refuses to watch it. Frankly, it's a little boring."
3,GREAT SINGER,Its just a shame that whoever mastered this cd did so at such low volume levels you have to turn your sound system way up to get a decent sound level...otherwise a great release from this wonderful vocalist. I gave it 3 stars because of the recording quality.
1,...,"How many times will Kurt Angle talk about how he loves himself. Throughout the whole book, Angle was talking about how great of an Olympic champion he was. Boring.Then after his bragging Angle states that he is not cocky but humble. Yeah right! His story about his father was very sincere and it seemed very honest. That was the only chapter that I did like to read. I see why this book did not do so well, mainly because he talks like a rookie pro wrestler. For any Kurt Angle fans, you guys are welcome to buy it. If so then buy it on paperback this fall for a cheaper price instead of buying the hardcover."
4,It's true! This book was decent,"This book was very well written and it seemed to have a little more thought and plot than the last wrestler book. I mean Chyna's book was nothing than a certifiable joke. So, thank you Kurt Angle, for giving us something worthy of reading."
3,What Was The Purpose Of This Book?,"I am a wrestling fan and I've ready quite a few of the wrestling biographies that have come out. By far, this one had the least purpose. Kurt Angle has come to the top of the professional wrestling world in an incredibly short amount of time and that is to be respected. However, how he got there was hardly worth an entire book. There were no great ""inside stories"", horrible obstacles that he overcame. His talent as a wrestling performer is without question, but did he need a whole book to talk about it? I just didn't see the need. Read Foley's book if you want to be entertained and watch Angle to be impressed with his abilities."
4,"Jimmy, we gotta make a page quota! Set spacing to 1.5!!!","Decent book, but it felt rushed. This wasn't of the same caliber of either of Foley's efforts, or even the Rock's. It's no fault of Angle's--the guy's still quite young, and he's spent the better part of his life doing wrestling drills. Could they have dug for more info? Definitely.It's still a pretty good read, enough so that I bumped it up from bathroom to bedside status...not that it took very long to polish off. Too short for the original publishing price, but it should be available in the ... range by now, which is fair enough even if it's relegated to crapper duty."
3,3 stars for 3 I's,"I'm a huge Kurt Angle fan, and I was happy to see this book when it first came out. It was ok, there wasn't really a lot to keep me entertainned and wanted to keep me reading page after page. I read it all, took me longer then I wanted, I felt more compelled to read it because I'm a fan and I paid good money for it than reading it because I wanted too. If he were to write a book now or say in the next 2-3 years, I think THAT book would be fantastic."
4,AN ENTERTAINING BOOK,"THIS IS ABOUT THE LIFE AND CAREER OF PRO WRESTLER KURT ANGLE. I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE BOTH ENTERTAINING AND INTERESTING. HE GIVES A BIT ABOUT HIS CHILDHOOD GROWING UP IN PITTSBURG WHERE HIS FATHER DIED IN A TRAGIC ACCIDENT TO HIS SUCCESS IN WWE. ALONG THE WAY KURT TELLS US OF THIS WRESTLING CAREER IN HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE AND OLYMPICS. I FOUND THE HIGHLIGHTS TO BE HIS RELATIONSHIPS WITH HHH, BOSS MCMAHON AND VARIOUS OTHERS WHO HELPED HIM ALONG IN HIS CAREER. I RECOMMEND THIS FOR ALL WRESTLING FANS,NOT A GREAT BOOK BUT GOOD."
2,"It's True, It's Dull","I've read a lot of wrestler biographies and this one is near the bottom of the heap. Mind-numbingly repetitive and self-congratulatory, it's not worth the effort. If you want an interesting story, read the Ric Flair (To Be The Man) or Tom ""British Bulldog"" Billington (Pure Dynamite) books, or the excellent business side of wrestling book, Sex, Lies and Headlocks; if you want a bizarre story, read the Chyna book. If you have trouble getting to sleep at night, by all means pick this one up. Sorry Kurt but clean living and an encylopaedic recitation of your accomplishments, as impressive as they may be, do not make compelling reading."
2,"Boring beyond belief. It's true, it's true","Graet book if you like long, looonnng stories about what his olympic training consisted of. If thats not what youre interested in avoid this book like you'd avoid contact with The Big Shows jockstrap."
3,and i so wanted to like kurt angle even more...,"After the two great novels by Mick Foley, Kurt Angle had huge shoes to fill. Sadly, he tripped trying to insert the first foot. Slow, fairly boring, and without much soul, Angle's book is clearly done by a ghost writer most of the time, and frankly, his story isn't that interesting. Better luck with the Rock's book, although it too can't touch Foley's flare."
3,Cool book!,"Well this book is pretty good.. It gives great deail in Kurt Angle's life, not just the wrestler but the man himself...But the Mick Foley ones are a better read"
1,Reviewer,"This book called It's true It's true book is full of lies and deceit. It is interesting to note, Kurt Angle has only one child and that is his son by Nicesty Girl. The fans has been knowing her since December 89. She has other children by two other wrestlers. Her true tell all book that Angle and other's on his behalf has tried several times to stop her from getting it published will be out by the end of the year."
4,Kurt Angle insight in the making of a superstar,"The best WWF book except for the Foley books. Rock and Chyna should really had better books, it could be done after reading this one.The first part about Kurt Angle amateur wrestler is great and very informative about the sport and especially the trainning.The second part about is WWF career is also very informative as he discover the world of sport entertainment and he is very insightfull on the developpment of his television character. A good way to see how you create a superstar.He finish the book strong with a really good Vince McMahon story and reveal his final dream as one of the greatest wrestler of medern time. A must read for the real die hard fan of the business."
1,Waste of Time,The author is a lazy slacker who's never had an original thought in his entire life. Before buying this book do youself a favor(and save some money) take a hammer hold it in front of your face. Swing towards your forehead. Apply ice. This will give the same effect as reading this tripe.
4,Excellent video on the founders of a dreamland,"This is another very intersting video, for people interested in the history of the people that were responsible for our dreams, and the way we thought life would be like, when we were very young. It is amazing that people with little education shaped so well the minds of young people."
5,Beyond happy with my bag =),The bag is great. Lots of pockets and storage space. Colors look even better in person! Although I have yet to travel with it yet I am sure it will be able to stand up to the traveling conditions. Seems very sturdy easy to move and turn and walk with.
2,"Too little, too late.","Although this book portends to be a tome of great importance to the profession of lifesaving, it actually contains little substantial information, and few skills of vital importance to the surf lifesaver.If you really wish to educate yourself on matters of ocean rescue, you would do well to get the USLA manual rather than this text."
3,harp light,"Strong songwriting and every cut is enjoyable, but very little harmonica. The instrumental ""Night Child"" is the only song where the harmonica is out front. The only other song where you can even hear the harp is on ""Trainman"" With such a title, you would expect the harp to be dominant, but you can barely hear it and only towards the end of the song. I think most people buy Butterfield albums to hear him play harp, stick with his earlier albums if you're one of those poeple."
1,Self Important Drivel,"This CD drips with its own sense of self importance, and has nothing new to say. Highly recommended by the introspective bedsit set, not for the rest of us."
4,This book reveals important information about the disfunctional organisation that the UN has become.,"The idea of the United Nations is magical, but the organisation today is little more than another weapon for the powerful countries. Hats off to these genuine men (and woman) for telling it as it is and was...."
3,another tv,this is a typical nothing special about it tv! it has volume and and on and off button. whats the big wow about. oh yah.....the ppg pictures on it. i guess thats the reason i begged and pleeded my parents to buy it. i was wrong! this is a normal tv and the only special thing about its ppg tv. wow! not! sure its got a big screen and the coolest stand also an awsome picture but is that any reason to buy a tv. mhhh maybe im wrong! maybe IT IS special. mhhhhh
3,Not for me,Whoops. My brother -in-law suggested Greg Brown but I made some uninformed choices. There are some good ones out there this is not one.
5,"Unusual repertoire, excellent performances","Perfect for the solo classical guitar fan who's tired of hearing the same old standard rep rehashed over and over again.Slotkin unearths some unique gems here, with a number of pieces from 20th century French composers (Roussel, Auric, Poulenc, Milhaud) that are probably unfamiliar to most. The remainder of the program runs the gamut from Latin (Chavez, Orbon, Villa-Lobos, Falla) to European (Martin, Henze), all with equally successful and musically compelling results. For the completists out there, there's even a world premiere.Clearly, the performer is in his element here -- you can hear his love for this music shining through. The sound quality is similarly excellent. Definitely a worthwhile purchase, and a guitarist to watch."
3,sent product as advertised,"The shipper sent the product as advertised (no problem in the shipping). But, the monitor was not what I expected. It is hard to see certain objects and text on the monitor, even when I tried to adjust it. I would buy from Tigerdirect again, but not another Hyundai monitor."
1,Save Your Money,The first step in raising your profitability would be to not waste your money on this book. It contains nothing that isn't plain old common sense.
1,NOT ENOUGH SUBSTANCE,"THIS BOOK WAS DISAPPOINTING TO ME. THERE JUST ISN'T ENOUGH IN IT. THE THINGS THAT ARE WRITTEN IN IT ARE SO COMMON SENSE IT SEEMS A WASTE TO WRITE THEM. MAYBE I WAS JUST EXPECTING A LITTLE MORE IN DEPTH APPROACH, BUT ALL IN ALL I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."
5,Very informative book,I got a lot out of this book. The book gave good information on setting realistic goals and what to plan on for your farm.
5,"It's about business, the business of farming.","This book is about the business of farming. It is not about how to produce a specific crop or livestock. There are many other books out there that cover these subjects. Some people rated this book poorly because their expectations for the book conflicted with what the book's subject is.If you want to know about the buying equipment, how many hours of your time and how much capital you'll need to expend on various livestock or crops and how much you can expect to profit by those efforts, this is the book that will help you."
1,Where's the beef?,"I kept reading and reading looking for the exciting practical information promised by all these reviews. Then the book ended. Then I looked back at the reviews to see what I'd missed that (mis)lead me to believe there was practical information in it. They use words like 'overview' to indicate that there ain't much in the way of real meat in this book. I can sum it up in one sentence: Find yourself a niche market locally and grow what they want. If you need details about producing the product, this is not the book you're looking for.For extensive, detailed, practical information about making money by pasturing mixed species of livestock, look at books by Joel Salatin. But even he could still bring in more complementary planting for winter forage. Greg Judy has a detailed book about making money with livestock without owning the land or the livestock."
4,Good for the skin,"I wouldn't say this soap is anymore stimulating than any other soap in the shower. BUT, caffeine on the skin is actually a means of protection from skin cancer. I abuse caffeine, guarana & ephedra, so just because this isn't stimulating for me, doesn't mean it isnt stimulating at all.Caffeine on the skin is good. See also:Bath Buzz Caffeinated LotionI hate to say it, but I purchased this on eBay. There are more sellers and they lower the prices for competition."
2,No Buzz,"I read a lot of the reviews. My skin does not feel different after I use this soap. I was expecting it to leave a tingling feeling or some evidence of the caffeine or peppermint so I was very disappointed. On the other hand, the soap has a nice scent & lathers up rather nicely. The shipping cost was a lot more than I would usually pay for, but I was placing a large Amazon order and wasn't really paying attention to which items had shipping fees so that's my fault. Giving the product a 2.5 rating."
5,Not your ordinary soap,"I got this for my brother who might be addicted to caffeine, and this is what he said about it:""Speaking of a caffeinated buzz, that soap that you gave me for Christmas is crazy good. If I knew absorbing caffeine through your skin was this effective, I would have started bathing in coffee years ago."""
4,Shower Shock,"I'm not sure how stimulating it is, but the smell is really pleasant and I do feel more awake after my shower..it cleanses well."
2,Good soap but no perk,"If you are looking for a nice soap with great lather and good minty feeling, this is your soap. Just do not expect this to replace your morning coffee..."
5,"Very informative text, and yet understandable!","This book is an authoritative text; this book gives you real content about this science that you can understand.'Cannabis and Cannabiniods' will give you answers that most folk's just haven't learned yet.Cannabis and Cannabiniods: Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Therapuetic Potential"
3,Adequate Hawaiian Music,"Low key Hawaiian tunes, authentic, but nothing too special. Fine for background music at your luau, but not if you are looking for PARTY music."
3,Introduction to hedgefunds,"The book opens with an overview of hedge funds. He classifies hedge funds according to the strategies they employ: relative value, event driven, macro, etc. Not only does he explain the trading strategies, but he delves into what can go wrong. In general theres more discussions on equity related strategies, and less in interest rates. Theres lots of historical data/information on hedgefunds performance ,indicating the very poor performance (and high total risk) of traditional funds.This book provides a nice introduction to hedgefunds, perhaps not so much news for experienced readers. At times theres very detailed information, in other parts the author provides only an overview (whos the audience?)."
2,Dances Around the Topic,"This book rambles on about the hedge fund industry. It gives a lot of definitions and statistics, but ultimately falls down. When you buy a hedge fund, you never really know what you are getting."
4,Nice read,"I bought this book on the recommendation from a colleague, and I'm glad I did. I may use a few chapters for readings for my class."
5,Another winner from Thierry Mugler,"I've been a fan of Mugler's original Angel Men products for some time, so I thought that I'd give this a try. I actually prefer it to the earlier offering. Obviously fragrances are difficult to recommend (we all react differently to different scents), but this seems more subtle while still making a statement."
4,It works with MAC OS X!,"I bought this webcam a couple of days ago and installed it on my ibook G4. The pictures are fine when considering its price, $32 on surplus computer! With quickcapture, the max size of video can reach 640*480.Speaking of webcam, I must say something about video conference between PC and MAc systems. People living in PC words usually use MSN, however, the mac version of MSN doesn't support video and audio chats. So I use SightSpeed(it is free!) to video chat with my parents at China. The audio part are excellent. But the video quality is not compared to the one using quickcapture."
2,not too happy with the seller.,"webcam itself is fine. However, the box cannot let me believe it is a new one.Also, the picture shown on Amazon is completely different than the actual webcam."
3,Good but outdated,"I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed by the scope and content of the book. While some of the ideas are clearly timeless (e.g. quality of relationships, quality work, etc.), some of the techniques that are proposed are clearly outdated. The book should dig into the marketing potential of the Internet tool. It would also be useful to have some pointers and tricks on marketing services when you are just starting up. This book assumes that you are already established."
5,A must-have for any serious business person,"It doesn't matter what business you are in, you will probably learn a great deal from this book. It will definitely be helpful to anyone who operates a service business, and of course anyone who is looking to be, or is, a consultant. Written by someone who has definitely been there before, this book covers everything from whether or not you should be working for yourself, things to watch out for, how to learn from your mistakes, communicating with clients and a lot more. Another great book you may want to check out is Alan Weiss's book 'Getting Started in Consulting'."
5,This book will pay for itself many times over,"Alan's sage advice will help anyone currently consulting, or considering becoming a consultant. He explains how to get out of the ""hourly charge"" rut and charge what a project is worth. I've earned tens of thousands of dollars more as a result of following his advice in this book."
2,My Repute,"I must admit, I only read two thirds of this book. Although the first few chapters had good advice applicable to many business practices, Mr. Weiss slowly digressed into self-congratulatory monotony. I didn't even click on Amazon's ""I have one to sell"" button... I just trashed it."
1,Don't read this unless you're specifically in this field.,"I learned nothing. There is a list on nearly every page...this guy loves his lists. I'm a list person myself but OVERKILL. I got too bogged down in the lists and couldnt ever make myself concentrate on more than two pages at a time. I hate to admit it, because I usually give a book an even chance and will try to finish it, but I GAVE UP.Learn how to write something other than a freaking list and I'd be more than happy to give your book another go."
2,Compatibly Issue,Not an item easily installed without additional support and resources.Not readily available on the Dell website to to age of equipment.
3,A fair CD,"The first song in this album is marvellous, while others just so so which is really a pity. I decided to buy it when I heard the first song but gave up afterwards."
5,"A beautiful, beautiful book",My children gave this book to me for Christmas as a companion to Frida's biography. It is beautiful and comprehensive. A must-have for any fan of her work.
5,"Beautiful Book, recommended","Excellent book, very happy with purchase, I have it on my living room. If You like art I highly recommend it"
4,The paintings and explanations of FRIDA,"This book is all you need to know about Frida in a conceise, pictorially loaded book.I found it to be filled with explanations of her feelings and her work. It made me understand her and the difficulties in her life. It is a valuable tool in getting to know the person and why she painted the way she did."
5,A Great Book about a Great Artist,"I am a serious fan of the life and work of Frida Kahlo and this book is agood addition to the material I already have on hand. This book combinesgood biographical material, a great collection of fine reproductions ofFrida's paintings plus a good description of many of the paintings. For anyone really interested in the life and work of Frida Kahlo, this book is a must."
1,Never were Muslim and never will be !!,I have lived in Turkey and I know for fact if someone lived with a true Islam they will never convert to any other religion. It is not necessary because Islam covers and accept the true Judaism and Christianity that revealed from God (Allah) and Muslims accept Jesus as prophet. Christians lives in Islamic countries (especially in Turkey where this false charlatan-Ergun Mehmet Caner came from) freely and they can practice their faith with great tolerance. Ergun Mehmet Caner was newer Muslim and just tries to make Islam bad by converting himself to Christianity. Ergun Caner's mother Inez Manica is Swedish Christian and His other relatives are also married with Christians. We as Muslims are not allowed to say anything bad against the People of the book -Christian and neither Jews nor we welcome anything negative said about Islam like these people claiming. What a pity for that and they will be judged by God in the Judgment day.
5,"Not music at all, but Hemi-Sync","This recording isn't part of the MetaMusic series, but the Mind Food series. And it isn't very interesting purely for listening entertainment. But it's great for studying, working (if your work doesn't require much human interaction, anyway), reading, or other activities that permit wearing of headphones, and involve mental focus and directing of attention! It would be perfect for computer programmers (nowadays we call 'em ""software engineers""), accounting, or the like. Headphones are strongly recommended, as with all Hemi-Sync products. Available on CD from Hemi-Sync.com."
2,Broken jewel box,"I purchased this CD to replace an identical one which I literally wore out, so obviously I'm satisfied with the quality of the performance and the selections included. However, the jewel box arrived in a state of total ruin - it was in pieces - no possible way to use it. I presume that the sender checked the condition of the jewel box before mailing it, but somehow it was damaged in transit (?)."
5,Great smart keyboard,"Bsd- I like this keyboard. Great sounds ,great rythms and easy of use.More powerful speakers wouldn't hurt.But you can't have it all.I use it even with my music group."
3,The Hounds of Winter,"I enjoyed the book until I noticed a lack of descriptive continuity starting on p. 195, where David was described as wearing an ""over-sized blue coat"", which became a camouflage jacket on p. 220, and a thin coat on p. 224, with no mention of having changed his coat, let alone the ability to have found another coat. Weather descriptions also lacked consistency, changing from snow, to sunlight, to ""the snow had not let up"", all within a short time frame starting on p. 214. As the book continued I quetioned David's super-human endurance and strength. Being a Wisconsin resident, it seemed the Wolf Center was located in the area around Wisconsin Dells, not northern Wisconsin where there actually are wolves.Because of the discrepancies and inconsistencies in this book, I am not sure I would buy or read another book by James Magnuson."
5,Finally a documentary that is not boring yet educational.,"If you are looking for answers for HOW the bible was put together, WHY there many version, WHO wrote it, and WHY there is so much contreversary over which one is the correct one. This is the DVD for you. The DVD starts with oral tradition at the time of Christ moves through history to explain the three W's easily. The DVD also included comments from experts in fields of history, theology etc.Well worth money, and an excellent educational tool!"
3,Two Nil - better the second time around,"I really dug One Nil. For a timme, then the second version (One All) came along, which was the album One Nil should have been. Neil writes more filler than anyone is allowed to know about (!!) but they are usually pared down to the best cuts for his records. (Mitchell Froom deserves a lot of credit for classics like Fall At Your Feet and Something So Strong.) When Neil is left on his own, he makes more blunders... which is why after sitting around on the shelves, Neil realized One Nil could be improved even more.If only ALL artists had the luxury of repackaging their albums with a few new cuts, taking out a couple of fillers, when they had some time to think about it - or had written some better songs!To me, it's almost like cheating. Oh well, Idols are never perfect. One All, however, has turned out to be a really terrific little album for all its tinkering, so I guess everyone wins, but Neil just loses a touch of respect from me."
4,Breaking It Down - How is this album? (for OY),"In a nutshell, this album is a compelling and mature effort from Neil Finn. The One All album is much more focused than his last admirable effort, Try Whistling This. Neil seems to feel at ease with Crowded House comfortably (but sadly) behind him. While the songwriting and musicianship on this album don't represent a complete departure from Crowded House, it should be noted that his songcraft and musical experimentation are much more complex. In short, buy this record. It's great to watch an artist mature and progress rather than deconstruct into a pool of disappointment. Look for the standout tracks Wherever You Are, Turn and Run, Anytime and Rest of the Day Off. Also, consider the Seven World Collide disc which places Split Enz, Crowded House, Finn and Neil Finn songs in the context of a wild array of guest stars like Eddie Vedder, Johnny Marr plus Ed and Phil from Radiohead. Oh, and of course, Neil's brother Tim."
5,just buy it,This disc has been in the player for about a year. We bought it at the Neil Finn show in San Diego last February and have not stopped listening to it since. Neil Finn is a very talented artist.
4,Warm album; I like it better than Crowded House,"More haunting tunes... And I can't believe his son's band, Bethchadupa, isn't mentioned in the Amazon suggestions. Check that one out, THE ALPHABETCHADUPA. Also the soundtrack to the movie RAIN, if you can get a copy. Father and son and some others give good stuff there."
5,Stellar,"This album takes a few listens. It might not overwhelm you on the first go, but after two, three, maybe ten listens, the beauty of each song starts to unfold. Pretty soon goosebumps start to form when you hear a certain song, and you'll find yourself putting it on repeat... Then, before you know it, you're just leaving the cd permanently in your stereo to listen to over and over. Neil is a master songwriter, musicial and vocalist. Buy this album, you won't regret it!"
5,A Finntastic record,"One great tune after another; an absolutely solid album. ""Turn and Run"" is a monster growling to be unleashed on the radio waves, while ""Last to Know"" is a possible crossover hit. If ""Anytime"" is the low point, this record is in the stratosphere.Packed with Finn's signature inventive textures, melodies and hooks, and poetry we can all relate to, ONE ALL will stand the test of time."
5,Excellent tire for dry conditions racing,"I switched to the Michelin from the Specialized FastTraks because I was very unhappy with the traction from the FastTraks, both for cornering and for climbing. Although the XCRs are a little heavier than the FastTraks their grip and low rolling resistance more than make up for that and I feel my overall ride feel is noticeably better. I run them tubeless with Stan's although they're not made to be tubeless. Out of the box they did not seat on the rim, so I mounted them with tubes for a few days to stretch out, then took the tubes out and was able to mount them. I then rode them to win the California state championship. I've searched a lot for a tire that does well with the loose-over-hardpack conditions we have around here and these are the best I've tried by far. I don't think they'll do well when the trails get wet, given their low, close tread pattern. For dry conditions I highly recommend them."
5,My Buzz Came Back...,"...when i hummed these little tunes. I was fortunate enough to catch these guys at a recent New Years show and let me tell you, they know how to rock a crowd. This cd perfectly captures their unique blend of hip-hop, steel guitar, pop, and soul. I could go into how wonderfully written these gems are, and the tight musicianship... but, at the end of the day, what i love most about this cd, is that it just feels REAL good. There is an undercurrent of positivity in every tune, something lacking in almost all modern rap-incorparated music. Tracks 3,4, and 5 are pure gold, but there really are no duds to be found here. From the upbeat, danceable opening number ""Everybody Knows"" to the maxed out, slo burner closing ""Below the City"", this cd and live act are not to be missed out on. ""I got mine so get yours!"""
1,Reminds me of a old NES game,"I browsing through the local Mega Chain Retailer's game aisle one day and came upon this game. I am big fan of racing and racing games, NASCAR, Grand Turismo, F1 and so forth so I picked up this game. When I first started playing the game the intro menu and screens reminded me of something I would have seen in an old original Nintendo game or PS1. The graphics were awful and blurry. Once the game play started it got better but that first impression was a real turn off.The only real positive item about this game is the game play is decent. The changing race conditions with the length of show is a realistic element that makes the racing a little more enjoyable. I agree with past posters the lack or real sprint cars does take away from the realism of the game. I should have known better to than to buy something from the ""game bin"" but for 10 bucks it was worth a few hours of fun."
1,Dont waste your money on this game,"I was real dissapointed in this game. First thing that got my attention was only one real sprint car that actually raced on the track, the rest generic cars with people that were driving them that I guess worked for the same company that produced the game. Real race fans that play games like this I say DO NOT LIKE THIS AT ALL!!! One thing I can say that the racing aspect was pretty good but I cant give it anymore than one star for the stupid mistake they made by not having real race cars and real drivers! I repeat Dont waste your money on this game!!!"
1,dont waste $15.00,"dont waste your money on this game!!!!! if you love sprint car racing buy world of outlaws 2002. it is the most realistic racing game on the market,even better than any of the nascar games. pay the extra money and buy world of outlaws 2002.you will not be sorry."
4,My son uses these picks often,"My son has tried a lot of different picks, these are his second favorite overall (his favorites are the ones that hook over your thumb so you can't drop them easily). He likes the flexibility of these and the comfort between thumb and forefinger. They seem to last a while, too, so they're pretty sturdy."
2,No different from a regular guitar pick,"AS you can see in the product photo the center part of the pick where your thumb lies is constructed outward. While in reality that part actually goes inward. I thought that this pick would be a thick pick. But inreality its not. This Dava pick is as thick as a regular .70mm pick. Also, the middle part of the pick is so thin that it can easily break the whole pick into two pieces."
3,It's OK...,"Obviously, finding just the right guitar pick is a very personal thing. I'm much happier with the Dava jazz pick than I am with this Delrin pick. I've played on the Dava Jazz Grip (9024) for some time and love everything about it. Their jazz pick is my go to choice for most of my guitar work, regardless of music style.Mistakenly, I assumed their slightly larger Delrin pick would have similar qualities. Other than the Dava brand, it does not. This is a well made Delrin pick with a contoured finger depression also of rigid Delrin material. I was expecting the same soft, grippy, rubberized material like the jazz pick that is so wonderful to play. No such luck. This pick is okay and does provide somewhat more gripping surface than most picks. However, in my opinion, Dava would have a real winner if the black overmolding was a soft rubberized material instead."
3,Ok pick,I bought this with memories of when I was a teen and you could get picks with rubber grips. I loved those picks been trying to find them for years. I ordered these thinking it would be the same. Don't get me wrong these are very nice picks I just thought they would be rubber and not plastic. My fault for not doing my research. Very fast delivery.
2,dava 1303 delrin grip tips,this pick really isnt worth anything. so cheap plastic feeling. the whole thing. made cheaply. even the kids dont like it. very bendable. not worth anything. dont waste your time energy or money.
3,Not for Me,"This would be great for people who are just starting out at guitar and aren't sure about which gauge picks to buy, or perhaps for a guitar teacher to have on hand for students who forget to bring picks to their lessons. For me, I like heavy gauge picks and this does not cut it for me. If you play a lot of chordal songs this might be a good choice. It's cheap and innovative, but once you find a gauge that you like you most likely won't need or want to change the gauge mid performance. It would be cheaper to just buy a pack or picks of varying gauges and experiment to find out which works best for you, then just buy a lot of that particular gauge."
5,quite awesme ..,was a bit skeptical as no one i know had used this type of a pick .. quite easy to go from rhythm to lead .. shared with friends they loved it too .. quite durable too ..
5,Great pick,"Price is good, shipping was quick, works great! Has survived the cat many a time stealing it and playing around with no ill effects, feels good in my fingers and I am happy with it."
2,They look cool,These look so neat that my brother and I both unknowingly ordered these for each other as gifts last Christmas. Unfortunately they feel too chunky to use and the colored tip grips the strings in an unfortunate way making it difficult to play.
2,My husband didn't like it!,My husband said it seemed to pull hair rather than cut. Purchased another that he was happy with. We wouldn't recommend this item.
1,Garbage,"The battery lasts about 2 minutes after the first charge and never charges again so it always has to be plugged in. Six months later, it only turns on occasionally, and stops at the slightest resistance. Absolute garbage."
1,DOES NOT WORK!,This shaver does not even work! ... it won't come on .. and the blue light jus stays on.. I DEMAND a refund ASAP!
3,not very comfortable,"The trimmer is very nice and modern, but it is not very comfortable to use the small blade is not small enough to cut the beard."
2,Three strikes and you're out,"The battery for this unit is just plain garbage. So the first unit I bought directly from Amazon. It lasted about a month maybe two then the battery would only hold a 30 second charge. (after an entire night of charging) So I returned that one and they sent another. This one wouldny even power up at all, so I exchanged again. After about 2-3 weeks it started doing the 30 second battery life again. Its a real shame because its a very ""cool"" looking unit."
3,"Only good for facial hair trimming, not much else.","Great for trimming facial hair and neck. The attachments don't work too well for softer hair. If you need to do some....eh-hem, manscaping, this is not the right shaver. Well, that's what a friend told me..."
1,Read _Here Comes the Sun_ by Joshua Greene instead.,"This reads like a pretty pathetic rush job published in 2002 shortly after Harrison's death. _FAR_ better is the newer bio. of Harrison, _Here Comes the Sun_ which the author, Joshua Greene, took the deserved time to write. (See my review for that book, too.)Greene is a former Hare Krishna devotee who actually spent a respectable amount of time in Harrison's presence. I doubt Shapiro can say this._Behind Sad Eyes_ contains mostly conjecture and unsubstantiated musings by Shapiro in which he has cherry-picked the (painfully few) Harrison quotes from a host of other sources. Also, Shapiro's style is much more of the _National Enquirer_ category--preoccupied with the salacious over the substantive.Oh yes, the copy editing is poor too -- obvious mispellings, dropped words, that sort of thing. Another sign of a rush job."
3,behind sad eyes: the life of george harrison,"this bio was an easy read on george. disappointed that it did not cover more on his days with the beatles, the songs he performed with the beatles & the music he wrote while a beatle. otherwise it was a good read for beatle fans."
2,PISS POOR WRITING.,"Having read about 200 books on the Beatles, this is among the worst. There's nothing insightful or informative about this book. The only original material seems to be unsupported speculation. An entire waste of time."
3,"The Eyes are not the only ""SAD"" thing here!","I have always liked Harrison, and his great songs! He was always the Beatle that I prefered in most contexts, though McCartney is certainly the the ranking genuis of the genre. But, Harrison was the one that intrigued my curiosity during those wonderful years when music was created, & rated, by merit, rather than hype.But this book was not as informative as I had hoped prior to the read. It would be a good starting text for the novice, but for those of us that have followed the fabs since the sixties, this work lacks any surprises.I did enjoy the photos, and the cover shot is the best of the group of biographical works that have come to the market since November 29, 2001. But, read this only if it is among your first books on the subject of George Harrison."
