3,No English subs built in,"Sadly I have to watch the movie on my computer, even though the case says it has English subs it does not, The only reason I am not giving this one star is that I love the animation."
4,"Kin to the ""brotherhood""","The dream of ""The Jericho Mile"" began long before it's television debut. For those of ""us"" who had/have family or friends who were non-paid ""participants"" to this emotionally inspiring movie of basic human triumph. With time so abundant in prison the need for a watch is not necessary. But with a stop-watch, freedom is just a few minutes away. The use of real prison inmates in one of California's toughest penitentiaries brings to life the spririt of ""brotherhood"" and the harsh reality of everyday prison life in Folsom. With the new Olympic sanctioned race track, Rain Murphy runs not only for Olympic gold but for the ""The Jericho Mile""."
1,disgusted by lack of professionalism by amazon,"With DVD movies,the staff at amazon should be liable and know that the u.s.a. is region 1 and Europe is region 2.This was my first time to purchase movies,they were Christmas gifts ,the order was screwed up from the beginning and when they came most could not be played. My brother made the mistake of trying to play on his computer because it would not play on his DVD,the computer repairs cost over 100.00.Amazon movies, I've learned my lesson ,thanks but no thanks I'll find better ways to lose 180.00.I'd like a refund or first class tickets to Europe where I'll be able to watch the movies.John Helton"
1,dvd,"I am very upset, I bought a dvd for my husband for a Christmas present. He opened it so we could watch it and it would not play in our dvd player. Then we saw it was German. I sure wish I was aware of this before I purchased this. I most likely will NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM AMAZON AGAIN. I was very upset because as a family we were all ready to watch a very inspirational movie on Christmas day as a family and Our whole evening was ruined because it would not play in Our standard dvd player. Wrong region!"
5,Simply great!,One of the great movies with Peter Strauss. I have searched for it for years and continue to. Please re-release it!
1,Not Impressed,Not able to watch video as it does not work with our video systems you need to have a system from the Netherlands??????It was a waste of money - never order again (there wasn't enough information explaining what was required to view the video and didn't realize the video came from another country - sucks!
1,good movies to dvd?,I remember this movie from so long ago and after all these years it fails to go to dvd! I do not pretend to know why it isnt being done.....but I see alot worse films on dvd. This was a great movie for Peter Strauss who has so much talent even today! Cmon........lets get this to dvd and make customers happy!!Please explain how Amazon backs this sale of a REGION 2 when it is NOT used in the USA or Canada? Are the sales in these countries not important?
5,understand grace,to fully understand grace is a lifelong journery. this book is very helpful. I've study the subject of grace many years and with many authors...this book is by far the best.
4,Grace as ordinary,"A great book to help us recognize that grace exists, even abounds in the ordinary moments of ordinary lives."
2,Blue River/Gone to Texas,"Blue River had only a guest appearance of Sam Elliot, Gone to Texas dragged, Boring, Don't waste your time or money on this one........"
4,Gone To Texas / Blue River,Enjoyed this western Sam Elliott is a very good actor plenty of action well worth watching. Blue River was not so good thought it may have been a western but turned out to be more modern action movie.
1,Blue River / Gone to Texas,"I bought these two movies because I thought they were Sam Elliott movies. His role was minimal in the first movie, so I have attempted to watch the second movie yet."
4,Good But He Has Better,"As a Sam Elliot fan I enjoyed Gone to Texas and Blue River. I thought because of the subject matter that they would be boring but was pleasantly surprised with Sam's performance. If you have not seen Sam Elliot in Western Movies before and like these, you might try Conager, The Sacketts and The Shadow Riders with Ben Johnson, Glenn Ford, Tom Selleck, Katharine Ross, Barry Corbin and more. They have a lot more action and are based on Western Writer Louis L'Amour's books."
4,Good Movie,Sam Elliot is great as always. This is a good movie for Texans and those who want to know more about the history of Texas.
2,Review of videos,"To state these movies are meat and potatoe type westerns would be stretching the truth. More like cornbread and beans. Sam Elliot must really have been hungry. Definitely had that ""made for tv"" look."
2,Buy the Giraffe Tower instead,"My little brothers got this for their birthday along with the Giraffe tower and several other block sets. All of the sets are great except for this one. It only comes with four blocks and two of them barely do anything. The blocks fall out of the arc anytime it gets moved or bumped. It's a cute toy if you want to use it for decoration only, but to play with, it is not very good. They both love the tumbling giraffe tower though and play with all of the other blocks. They also love the vehicles set. I love this toy too because it keeps my brothers busy for hours while my mom is working on chores and cooking and it's easy to help her watch them. They actually play by themselves. Also, this keeps them out of my stuff."
1,Not a Fun Toy,"This toy was bought for my 9 month old daugter. I thought this toy looked like fun at the store but guess I was wrong. They toy includes four clear plastic blocks that each have a place in the arch. One is elephants, lions, penguins, and fish. The best two blocks are the fish which is full of water, and the penguins which have ""snow"" inside the blocks.Well the idea is to put the blocks in the arch and rock it back and forth to create motion inside the blocks. One problem is the motion in the lion and elephant can hardley be detected by an adult much less an infant. They barely tilt their head and only if they are in the proper position. It is also hard to keep the blocks on the arch, they always come off.They make a similar toy involving the same type of blocks called Tumbling Giraffe, it looks more fun than this one. I personally would not recommend this and would take it back had I not thrown out the packaging."
1,Useless....,"This toy does nothing. My 7 month old son received this as a gift and has touched it maybe twice. When you try to rock it back and forth, the blocks fall out. The blocks are supposed to have movement inside but the only one of any interest is the fish. He does like looking at himself in the mirror but I can sit him in front of the one in our bathroom and accomplish this. I plan to buy the truck and just use the blocks from the ark as extras. The ark itself is useless!"
3,The Blocks Are Neat!!!,"Just love the blocks...we don't play with the Ark as much. I would just buy blocks forget the Ark, wagon, giraffe!!!The BLOCKS make a great gift!!!"
2,Worst of the set,"My 11-month old son has every item in the collection and this is, by far, the worst. I give it two stars for fun simply because he still likes to knock it down and play with the blocks. The arc itself is what makes it such a bad toy mainly because it's only purpose is to hold the blocks...which constantly fall out. All of the other Peek-a-Blocks items are much better than this."
3,Kind provision of technical data of ITPA,This work provides detailed data on the ITPA. The book is very useful for researchers undertaking detailed analyses of the ITPA.
5,"Pleasant voices, Relaxing Music, Great Messages","Of all the music I considered for my kids at bedtime, I like this one the best. My girls like it too, which is the true test. We tried out other bedtime CD's that had high-pitched voices or creepy voices, but on the Chitra Sukhu CD's, both the child and adult voices are pleasant. The music is relaxing too, and the affirmations are understandable to my daughter."
1,Not helpful for building water features,This was mostly a book discussing what not to do and naturalizing your water feature. This is not a good how-to type book.
2,Good and bad water gardens,"As with most books published by Timber Press the overall content and layout are above average. I like the way photos are in sync with the text, and the reader carried through the design process in an economical discussion of salient points. The major downfall in the book, and it is major, appears in the authors credits for the landscape designs highlighted for discussion. In every instance the authors own designs are found in the category of the right way to design, as might be expected. But in a petty or mindlessly inadventurous way, he sees fit to credit all the examples he uses as bad design, not his, with the actual designers name. No matter how good a book, I would not purchase a work that degrades another's reputation."
3,"Thinking, thinking","The Little Owl Book of Thinking is a little book about an old wise owl that is trying to teach a young owlet how to be wise. The book really made me think about the steps behind thinking and that there is a process before you reach any answer. I really thought it wasneat that they incorporated owls, trees and other animals into the book because kids usually enjoy them. The book didn't really catchmy attention at first because it isn't like any of the other books that I've ever read. I was glad that I continued to read it because I ended up really enjoying it and would recommend it to other kids (mature third graders up to sixth graders.Review by Young Mensan Grace, age 10"
1,disappointing!,"Not what I expected. Ms. Neville writes very little about the process of developing an icon, and way too much about her own neuroses. Not inspiring!"
3,Too many Sellers and too few buyers.,"If you like Peter Sellers this is a near must-see. He plays several characters all are not well developed. It's enjoyable, but not great. It is very sad that this movie has not been made available on DVD."
3,"Sellers Makes ""Zenda"" Worth Watching","The incomparable Peter Sellers shines in this 1979 comic remake of the Anthony Hope classic as he plays three roles (one relatively brief). Director Richard Quine seems a bit uneasy with the swashbuckling slapstick, but a decent cast makes up for the weak spots. In one of his final films, Sellers delivers a spot-on Michael Caine imitation as the no-nonsense Cockney cab driver. ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" is a pleasant romp that will not erase memories of the 1937 Ronald Colman version."
2,A waste of time!,"Being a fan of Peter Sellers I found this film to be one of his worst. It was very hard to watch because it was slow going and boring. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because Peter Sellers is in it and did a good job acting, no other reason."
2,so-so,"Wish I could say I loved it, but it was so-so. I did use it, but just not quite enough taste as some of their other items."
2,looks great flys lousy,"The kite was easy to put together . Looked great, then the real test in a 20 mph wind. I hope whomever designed this kites aerodynamics does not get a job desiginig for our air force. After several crashes I had other people try it ,same results, perfect nose dives. Back to the drawing board for the designer. The kite is now in my garden hanging on a bush as a decoration, looks fantastic....."
3,"perfect idea, too weak magnets!","The idea is fantastic, but for 3-6 years old it is not stable enough. The first comment I've got from my 5 years old was: ""IT IS FALLING APART"" and that was the end.I know that there are much stronger small magnets; the weak, cheap installed in magnaprphs are destroing the whole good concept."
5,Noonbory is super!,"I've enjoyed Noonbory & the Super Seven the most of all the kiddie programs I've watched with my 3 year old (Shaun the Sheep is a close second). Good stories and excellent characterizations along with trippy, technicolor CGI animation. It might seem impenetrable at first (to adults) because of the odd names, strange language and fast action, but after watching it a few times to become familiar with all the characters it reveals itself as a high-quality offering for children with good messages and genuine humor. Favorite characters: Jettybory and Mamby. Jettybory is a slightly edgy member of the Super Seven with super hearing and is a bit insecure about her small stature. Mamby is a little yellow blob that can do pretty much anything. You could rule the world with a Mamby in your pocket!"
5,Top Notch Wall Mount,"Before this wall mount purchase for my 19"" TV, I bought a swivel base from the same manufacturer for my 27"" Magnavox TV. AAA+++ quality for both items."
3,Dated,"Book arrived in excellent condition. As a ""how to"" book on B&B's its exhaustive on ""how to fluff the pillows""... but weak on marketing. And I say that because it does not focus on the Internet as a marketing tool, website features, search optimization. Marketing, getting business established and continually flowing in is a major element in establishing a B&B - unless you buy someone else's established business."
5,Excellent Replacement,"I got this for my son to replace the bag we got him with the camcorder several years ago. His old batteries were also not holding a charge anymore, so the new battery was a blessing. The bag is sturdy and handsome, and the battery works perfectly. Of course, the extra tape is always welcome.If you've got an older JVC camcorder (be sure to check your model), this is a great replacement set to freshen up your system."
3,Battery pack failed,"I bought this to replace my old battery. After recharged and replaced the new battery pack, my JVC camera displayed the remaining time of 50 minutes in recording. However after only one minute of recording, the battery low warning sign appeared, and the camera shutdown within 2 minutes. The battery pack may be either defective or counterfeited and thus it could not hold the charge.Fortunately, the return and refund process is very fast and the seller is kind enough not to require me to ship the package back, saving me the shipping cost."
2,Briefly & Clearly: Only for the Unrepentant Stravy Junky,"This will be a brief and clear review: Stravinsky's piano music is of variable quality, at best; Peter Hill's playing is overall serviceable, except an embarrassing Petrushka that extends beyond his ability; the piano is a wonderful Bösendorfer, caught far better here (St Martin's, 1996) than what Naxos achieved elsewhere. Advice: Get Kissin's stupendous Petrushka; get Béroff's gEMIni twofer if you are a serious Stravinsky fan; only consider this disc if you are an unrepentant Stravy junky.REFERENCES: Petrushka--Kissin; Other Works--Béroff"
3,Great Product,"I love rub'n buff, it is so handy for so many projects. This product was as expected with one exception, the tube was super tiny! That is why it only gets a 3 from me."
2,Was a waste of my money..,"I couldn't tell how dark the color was by the name ""Spanish copper."" It was almost black and not a copper color at all. If it had a clear color guide I definitely wouldn't have purchased it. I found out the hard way. Won't do that again."
4,Crazy!,"Rage is about a highschool student named Charlie who goes crazy, shoots a couple teachers and holds a classroom hostage. The crazy thing about it is only one kid in the class really seems to care that they are the hostages. There is more of a mob mentality than anything in the room. I wonder if this book was written any time around the columbine shootings, would it have been published? Stephen King sure has come a long way. His style of writing has changed drastically. I love everything he has written!!"
2,"King can do better, but this is one of his early ones so it makes sense","I own a copy of The Bachman Books, but have only gotten around to reading Rage, a book that quite creeped me out. I really didn't like the book beacause i didn't like the main character of Charlie much- maybe because i don't get him- but the book wasn't too bad. Obviously, since this is one of King's early works (I think he wrote this one before he even wrote Carrie) he can do a lot better. The idea that all those students aren't even moved when Charlie shoots their teacher- dead- to the floor- seems a little unbelievable to me. Plus, athough Ted was a pain in the neck, i still didn't see why they all started beating him to the point where he became a slobbering mess. It was alright, i guess, but King's gotten a lot better.(Interesting fact: After Columbine, Steven King requested Rage to go out of print.)"
4,Superb,This was the first time I read a Stephen King book and I`am flatterd that I got the possibility to read this book. I have read many books but they haven't been as subscribing as this was and I couldn`t stop reading and I read it in SWedish and it was great the he discriebed Charles Decker and the locker Titus was outstandingPatrik from Sweden Iám sorry for all the misstakes in text I just wrote Iám not so good with grammatics
2,Awful,"Unlikable characters, irritating dialogue, stupid plot, immature, boring. I gave the story 2 stars for the action away from the classroom.I'm hungry for a good Stephen King novel; will there be no more?"
4,Just what I expected.,"This talking action figure is just as it appears in the photo. The clothing is very detailed and the speeches are actual recordings of Mr. Reagan, not some actor portraying him. If you like Ronald Reagan you will love this figure."
4,Beautiful ballet,"The segments of Swan Lake performance included in the video are absolutely beautiful. I wish there were more. In between the segments the video shows 4-5 basic ballet movements, each demonstrated by ballet students and other real life objects doing similar things (like a top spinning or a tiger jumping). They are all nice to watch. The fairy that is leading the whole video has an annoying voice and laughter, but that's to be expected for a children's video. The 'audience' of the ballet performance are a bunch of little girls dressed up in tutus and they are silly and cute, just as they should be. A very entertaining video even for adult viewers. A nice way to expose your children to real classic ballet, but not one from which you would expect them to learn."
3,Just OK,"I bought this for my 4 1/2 years old daughter because of the high review rating, but my daughter wasn't interested. She left after about 5 minutes..."
5,Educational AND Fun!,"As soon as I brought out Prima Princessa presents Swan Lake, she saw that it was about ballet and instantly went and put on one of her 3 tutu's. She was so excited that she continued to run around the room while I got the DVD put in the player and on the TV.I love the way the DVD is broken up. You actually get to watch the Paris Opera Ballet perform Swan Lake all the while Prima Princessa narrates the entire story so your kids know what is going on. After each act viewers are given the opportunity to learn some ballet moves. This is great because it was hard for my girl to sit during the actual show so when the time came and Prima Princessa declared that it was our turn she was up and moving quicker than you can say jete!For the complete review of this product please visit[...]"
1,Doesn't get much more low budget,"I have a very hard time believing people gave this more than a 1 star rating. The only soundtrack is of the fairy narrator, and a few out-of-place, choppy sounds of children laughing. The bits between swan lake repeat annoyingly."
5,I WISHED I HAD THIS DVD WHEN MY GIRLS WERE YOUNGER!,I got this DVD through recommendation from my relative.It is beautifully done with world first class performance and introduction of basic steps. My family has been living overseas and no chance to let my girls find out how wonderful that classical ballet can be. I wished I had this DVD when my girls were younger!
2,"Great idea, poor execution",I got this for my 4 year-old daughter and I was pretty disappointed. They show too little of the actual ballet and too much of little girls dancing and falling down. I realize that it isn't a good idea to show the whole story considering the demographic and how Swan Lake ends but they could at least show a whole scene being danced. My daughter lost interest while they were in between the dancing scenes but loved watching the ballerinas dance. I think from now on I will just get the DVDs of the ballets without any interruptions.
3,Bumper Sticker Maker Software...,I got a software to make Bumper Stickers. That is great except that I did think I was going to receive a sample of paper with the software so I can print a few copies of stickers as well. The ad seemed to infer that sample paper comes with the product.
5,Great Purchase!!!,"I think it is great! You'll definitely enjoy listening to it in your car. My favorite songs are number(s) 5, 7 and 8. There is improvision throughout the entire cd; plus I really like the vocals. It has an upbeat feel so I think it will even pep you up for work. It can even motivate you on your way to class. All of the artists are talented and blend very well together."
5,Hot! Bio Ritmo is on Fire!,"such talent and passion in their music! Very uptempo, full of energy and definitely a must buy cd. Well worth it! Makes you wanna salsa all night long!"
3,On the surface,"This book just covers the surface of information for 70-291. There are obvious errors in the book. This is the same book as a book listed on Amazon ""Insidescoop..."" that cost double the cost of this book. But Insidescoop is suppose to come with a CD. All the other 70-291 books are better. The Trainning kit from Microsoft is the best."
2,Remember: Don't judge a book by its cover (or title).,"I plowed through this pedantic dissertation expecting some insight since this book was published by Oxford Univerity Press. I want to add to the excellent negative critiques posted here that her research on the self-help movement was about 15 years out of date. Moreover, I'm afraid that McGee misunderstood Eckart Tolle's work. One hopes this is due to her selective ""skimming"" rather than inability to understand Buddhist-based thought.Ultimately as much a waste of time as ""The Secret."" Ms. McGee's thesis is set upon an ""either/or"" straw dog argument that finding one's ""authentic"" self negates socialization and community. If that were so, how would she explain the plethora of self-help groups, which she interestingly doesn't discuss. Fortunately I got the book from the library. Unfortunately, I now owe two days overdue fine that I should bill to Oxford University Press. Great title and cover though!"
1,super disappointed,"let me give you a word of advice about some genuine self help you can put to use in your life immediately: don't buy this book. i had expected or at least hoped for an explanation of where self help breaks down and whether or not it works, and what i got instead was a long overly philosophical text that reminded me of my reading for college sociology. this book is a case of how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, in spades."
1,--snoooooorrrrrre--,"For a topic that seems incredibly hot right now, this book is b-o-r-i-n-g. Don't waste your time or money."
4,Pretty good machine,"I've had mine for about 10 years now with daily+ use. It only required one replacement part when I got it (used) and has functioned generally flawlessly for all this time. I'm an espresso connoisseur, roast my own beans and seek perfection from this machine. A great burr grinder is essential for this machine. Overall, it does a very good job, but is admittedly finicky. FRESH ROAST, grind, tamp and extraction must all be done very well or shot quality goes funky. Some gripes are the 4-hole standard steamer tip is BAD. It can be replaced with a 2-hole (Google this issue for recommendations) that will slow down the process a bit, make less mess in a small pitcher and permit great microfoam. Oh yeah, try a few different varieties of minimum 2% milk (whole is best!) from your supermarket - some foam MUCH better than others."
4,cute walker,"I bought it for my 4 and 7 year old grandsons who really ejoyed watching it walk around. It comes in one piece and the shipping was very reasonable! It doesn't do alot,but is very cute and a good idea for them to learn about solar power. I think it was a good gift."
2,Solar robot not fun,"This robot is too small , we expect a bit bigger size , it's moving too slow , not as much fun as we expected , my son lost his interest to this toy in 5 minutes , not worth the spending money."
4,was a little sad,"I bought this for my sons birthday and I also bought Luke. Well Lukes sword lights up like its suppose to, but this one doesn't. Needless to say I was a little disappointed. I even changed the cell batteries thinking that was the problem, but it still didn't work."
5,Finally..,"After trying at least three other programs this course has taught me in two months to be able to carry on a simple conversation with my spanish speaking co-workers. As well as developing an ear for different accents due to the use of various narrators on the course. However, I did start with level 2 of the course. Maybe level 1 is easy and moves to slow for some. But better to gain a sound foundation and learn thoroughly than go thru the material too quickly. It is so exciting to be able to listen to spanish radio and be able to pick up complete sentences rather than just a few common words like esta, aqui and senor. I havent completed level 2 and cant wait till I complete the entire 8 levels. I highly recommend this course."
4,Good Wrestling Shoes,"the shoes are comfortable and with a good grip for traction. The main reason underlying my purchase was to provide stability to my ankles and the shoes are also efficient in this feature. Generally speaking, it's a well-round shoes with no downsides."
5,Excellent wrestling shoe!,"My son is a senior in high school, wrestling for his fourth year, Chertow trained. He loves these shoes! He said they are very lightweight and have excellent grip. He highly recommends them. And I loved the sale price!"
5,helps my RA and Fibromyalgia,"I started taking this product about one month ago and was suprised at the general feeling of well being I got. I don't know how it works, but I do believe in it. I took a competitors' product like this years ago - but it was much more expensive. I had forgotten about it until recently when someone I know mentioned they were taking it and felt better. I bought this brand because of the difference in cost which was significant and like it very much."
4,"""The Rose and the Jackal"" is prime Christopher Reeve","""The Rose and the Jackal"" is pretty darn engaging if you're in the mood for an intense romantic drama set at the beginning of the Civil War. It's a frequently overlooked minor gem in the now limited body of work by actor Christopher Reeve. You even get to hear him with a Scottish brogue! Madolyn Smith Osborne is very strong also, and she got a Cable Ace Award nomination for Best Actress from her work here. Give the story ten or fifteen minutes to get rolling, and you're in for quite an intense conflict with this tale based on true events. The film is not without its shortcomings, and it sometimes goes over the top romantically, but it's a fun discovery in the realm of not-widely-known movies. By the end, you've got tears in your eyes, and what more can you ask?"
3,The Rose and the Jackal - VHS,Good story but video quality was substandard even for VHS standards. Unfortunately was not able to find this movie on DVD so had to settle for VHS. The story was good enough that we wanted to take a chance. Video quality was very disappointing.
3,very watchable IF you are a Miles fanatic,"This is a B- grade boot in terms of video and a B for sound. But the performance is so great you don't care after getting sucked into it. In contrast to the reviewer below, I found it very watchable."
5,Terrifying in its closeness to reality,"I'm glad this one came across my desk--it's a gripping ride of terror that's unrelenting in its pace, but also extremely relevant and perceptive. David, the protagonist, is just like many people I know--feeling lonely and isolated in a world that's becoming less and less connected. His feelings of disenfranchisement lead him to do something that he never would have done otherwise, and the price he pays is terrifying--especially when I think that he could be any of us. The psychology here is sound, also, as the results of being an adult child of an alcoholic and having grown up with an LD are very strongly and accurately shown in David's case. I'd highly recommend this work to anyone who feels somewhat adrift in an anonymous society--or even if you know someone like that. David's redemption is hard-fought, which makes it all the more satisfying."
3,Picture Book Version of the Christmas Story,"I gave this book only three stars because, being familiar with the original full-size picture book which has among the most gorgeous illustrations ever to grace the Christmas story, I was disappointed in this small edition. It's nice enough but not nearly as beautiful as the original. I'll keep looking amongst the used-book sellers for that one."
1,Not The Real Deal,"To some people, getting kefir from a commercial starter pack may seem like heaven. But the fact is, this is not real kefir. Real kefir does not need to be rebought once you buy it. It is a living symbiosis of bacteria and yeast that replicates and grows larger, producing more 'grains'. In no way can this be replicated in a commercial starter pack. If you want REAL kefir, do some research, find what do look for, and buy it elsewhere. Real kefir will last you forever, you'll never have to buy more unless you let the grains die from neglect!"
4,Good but a bit slow,"It came within the date range provided at time of order. However, I usually get things before the last day of the quoted receive by date. Would use them again as long as low postage will work for my needs. I.E. not in a hurry."
1,not working,"I purchased this from a health care provider, first time I bought an quart of organic goat milk with a whole pack in it. Nothing grow.Then the doctor told me I have to stir with sugar and warm water, let it sit for half hour, before add to the milk. I did that, and purchased two bottle of organic raw milk, still nothing grow.What a waste of time and money!"
2,"Great product, but mine arrived dead!!!","I've used others that have worked, but the grains in this one were dead. I wrote to the company on FB, but got no reply. I tried using each pack and all of them failed.... Maybe too much heat during delivery....don't know!!!"
1,None of my batches worked,I followed the instructions and none of the batches I tried to make worked. Nothing. Nada.
1,Overpriced and didn't work,This in no way made 42 gallons. I feel that I was mis-lead and will never buy this product again from this seller. I read many sources on making kefir as well as watched videos. The granules dissolved and no curds formed. I was able to get a yogurt type product on top of the kefir to use again but there is no way 42 gallons worth. I found the same stuff made by yo gourmet at Vitamin Cottage for $5. I was very disappointed.
1,Bad for Fungus Infection,This product will not suit anyone with Fungus Infection. I had experienced bad reactions with other Kefir products but i thought this would be different. This is suppose to be good for people with fungus infection. If you have Candida or other fungal infection please try only bacterial fermentation such as Kimchi. Please don't try kombucha or kefir if your immunity isn't good. You will have adverse reaction and it isn't Herxheimer reaction.
1,don't do it,"This did nothing. I tried three packets and nothing happened, aside from the milk spoiling. I have contacted customer support three times with no resolution. I even had my very detail-oreinted engineer husband stand by and made sure I did everything correctly. no dice.I went ahead and bought kefir grains (google kefir lady), which work great and will last forever. Plus, the health benefits are greater. Don't waste your money on this! Get the real deal and save yourself money in the long run."
4,Simply too perfect for words!!,"I was never a big fan of Mel C, she was what i think the worst thing in Spice Girls, but this album totally changed my mind, this is actually a GREAT ALBUM! I was impressed by it, really well done! I especially like that song Forever Again, it's simply too perfect words! Y'all should seriously buy this album if you're considering!!"
5,Can't explain how good this CD is!!!!,"Wow, didn't realize she had THIS much potential vocally on this CD. I haven't bought a CD since Reason(I live in the US, UNFORTUNATLY!!!! Red Girl Records doesn't let me download all their CD's on iTunes). Anyways, this CD is too good to be true. I downloaded the first five tracks at first, to get a glance at the CD and once I heard Protected, I had to download the rest. This time is dreamy vocals(as usual)...and the rest of the CD is just soooo good. Very commendable on her part!!! She harmonizes with herself so well, and picks such good songs to sing. I've loved her since the Spice Girls(has always been my favorite) but not the reason I love this CD. It's musically inspiring. Loves it!!!!"
2,Eh could do with out it,do not read the review that was done before me he is a die hard spice girls fan and would support them no matter what trash they release hence he likes life in mono by emma bunton (baby spice)A.K.A Crappy album i download it for free and it sucksanyway back to Melanie C and This Timethe album reminds me of reason which pales in comparison to Northern Star and Beautiful Intentions there are only a few stand out tracks on the album not worth buying in my book unless you are a huge melanie c fan a big dissapointment after Beautiful Intentions
5,Excellent fiction book to pair with a holocaust unit!,"This novel begins with Tony V who discovers a buried diary and starts secretly reading it. The novel switches between entries from the diary and ""real-time"" narrative of what is happening with Tony V.This novel would be excellent to pair with a holocaust study. As I was reading the entries from Pelly D's diary describing her gradual shift from being one of the elite to one of the outcasts, I was reminded of the accounts I've read about European Jews experiencing the same kind of shift."
4,An Adventure of Many Dimensions,"This a well told story that is at least as much about the nature of changing relationships, growth and facing fears as it is about circumnavigating Australia in a very small plane. The director (a new pilot)and her father (an even newer pilot) decide to fly around Australia and over the course of this trip learn about each other, the nature of relationships and themselves. That being said it is not overwrought or overly sentimental ... the landscape is as bold and striking as Ms. Petrillo is gutsy and articulate.This is a beautiful tale of a substantial journey over terrain that is both emotional and physical."
4,A beautiful documentary,Flyabout is a wonderful documentary. I have never been that into airplanes so at first I wasn't that interested in seeing it. But to my surprise it turned out to be a very moving film about a father and daughter flying across Australia. Full of twists and turns I recommend this film very highly. On a side note[...] reports that the Petrillo that directed Flyabout is married to Julian Petrillo who directed the fantastic documentary Word Wars. What a talented family. If you are looking for a great date night buy both and sit back and enjoy.
3,Enjoyable,"My wife and I found this DVD very enjoyable to watch. The flying was great, the scenery was nice, and the drama between Monika and her father was interesting. It should have 4 stars, but amazon wouldn't let me adjust my rating from 3 to 4.I realize it was filmed many years ago, but I wished it were in high definition (places like Australia and Alaska must be filmed in high definition from now on), and that I would have been able to hear cockpit audio. I record a lot of my flying and post them on youtube under the name ""flyboytucker"" and I use a small digital recorder to record the cockpit audio. I have found people find that much more enjoyable.I applaud Monika's hard work though. Flying, filming, financing, and editing a movie is no easy job. Support a fellow pilot and purchase this movie!"
5,Simply sublime,"I own many recordings of the Bach Cello Suites by many fine artists, including the EMI release of Casals. I can now give them away or sell them. There is only one recording I turn to now, and this is it. Ward Marston and the team at Naxos deserve the highest praise for the revelatory work they have done on these matchless recordings. Bravo!"
4,Casals' Bluelight Bach Special,"There are several different CD editions of these same classic recordings by Casals, but none are priced lower than this new set from Naxos. Not only do these two discs include all six suites for solo cello by Bach, but the second disc includes an extra half hour of assorted Bach cello transcriptions.The original recordings, made in the mid 1930's, have alot of hiss. Its like hearing a cello in the rain, but this is the same no matter what CD you buy. Its just the limits of the source material. You might as well go as cheap as you can.The background hiss can be annoying on your living room stereo, but when played in the car, or on a walkman, or on a desktop computer, it is not nearly as noticeable.Casals has been called a romantic in his approach to Bach. This is certainly a darker approach to the Bach Suites than, say, Yo Yo Ma."
5,?,"In response to the review below, let me remind you:1.) Casals has been dead for thirty years. So no need to go to Florida for him.2.) The suites were written for ""Unaccompanied Cello."""
3,High Level UML,"I found the book quite high-level, maybe more useful for those who are at first UML contact. If that's not the case, Booch and Rumbaugh's UML Reference manual is more comprehensive. I expected higher focus on UML 2.0, which is incorporated in the book at the same level as the ""classic"" UML. I would question the value added of some of the globally numbered recommendations: <<29. Left-Justify Text in Notes>>"
2,do not start learning uml here,If you do not know UML do not buy this book. It will not teach you UML.
4,Good Foundational Advice,"Like the book ""The Elements of Style"" that I was given to use in High School to improve my writing, this book seeks to do the same for your UML diagrams. The author states that the purpose of this book is to ""describe a collection of standards, conventions, and guidelines for creating effective UML diagrams"". This book succeeds in its goal. I really like the fact that at the beginning of each chapter, each chapter covers one diagram type, a short description of what the diagram is used for is presented. As a designer, I see these rules not being followed or ignored much of the time. Rule 15 (Prefer Well-Known Notation over Esoteric Notation) is what I see as one of the most violated rules. Most people seem to diagram what they think is appropriate and ignore the UML rules. Hmmm, sounds like most people that write as well."
2,Mixed bag,"This is not a book for everyone and certainly not recommended for any beginning student of taijiquan. Sophia Delza learned under the famous Ma Yueh-liang in China and yet she seems to have gone off on her own in many ways. She was trained as a dancer and she interpreted taijiquan as an exercise for health. Many people practice it this way. She has also written some unique poetry about taijiquan, some of which is actually quite profound. Somehow she completely missed the boat on the fact that taijiquan is a true martial art--if one has learned the complete art and mastered it. Sadly, very few people including so-called ""masters"" can demonstrate this. I would probably only recommend this book to a Wu stylist who already has many years of experience and many other, better books on taijiquan. This is more of a curiosity to glance at every once in while, certainly not essential."
4,Controversial pioneer in heroin rehab,"With a stunning display of verbal pyrotechnics and sheer force of personality, ex-con John Maher of the Delancy Street Foundation confronted his criminally inclined subjects on their most troublesome personal habit-- heroin addiction.This book is intense. It may force you to revisit some sticky questions.At what point is it no longer ethical to force your viewpoint on someone else for the sake of their own good? Is emotional abuse acceptable in certain circumstances? At what point is silence condoning heroin chic?Not exactly a pleasant read, but well worth the time."
1,Misrepresentation,"Ordered a set of 4. I received 1 glass. Macy's blamed Amazon, and it has been a battle to get even a refund."
5,Joseph Curiale,Joseph Curiale is a comtemporary and talented composer who has written some wonderful music. Try it -- you'll like it.
3,Populist & Full of Sentiment,"Those who erect barriers between critical approbation and emotionally touching the heart to those outside the circle of the contemporary music connouisseur are not going to like this CD. If a composer's work hints at popularity, then it isn't taken seriously.Joseph Curiale's music is very accessible. It is populist and full of sentiment. Mr. Curiale is an American composer with eclectic influences: Aaron Copland, John Williams, the minimalism of Steve Reich and John Adams, and perhaps the neo-classicalism of Stravinsky. This debut recording is impressive in many ways yet disappointing in others.There is great orchestration, lots of energy, a big resplendent sound, but few memorable tunes. It is enjoyable music but it will not warrant repeated and sustained listening.The most thought-provoking and creative piece is the title work, Awakenings, but Gates of Gold will have the broadest appeal."
3,disappointing,"As a follow-up to the 5-star effort ""Apart"", this is a very lackluster collection. I love Regina's voice- the way it can build in energy and power while maintaining a smooth, ethereal tonality (listen to ""Space"" on the Apart CD). That driving quality is lacking in this collection. I don't know much about mixing music, but it seems to me that the band overshadows the vocals on every track. Adding to the problem, Regina's singing seems overly subdued, and her vocal pitch on this CD is noticeably lower than previous efforts. After such a long wait, the finished product is very disappointing."
2,Nowhere near as good....,"As APART, which I loved. It's similar in tempo to Apart, but lacks the mood and sense of drama which really set it... Apart, lol. ""Long Division"" and ""Heavenly Slumber"" are nice tracks, but I found myself not being able to pay attention to most of the CD, it just doesnt grab you and say ""listen to me"". And somehow, the production value seems lowered on this CD, nothing stands out, be it a guitar hook or a particularly soothing vocal... it's all jumbled together and lost somehow. It has some nice moments, but if you want to listen to Mira, Apart is the one to get."
5,Wow,"That's all that really needs to be said. What we now know do to this work fills the void of understanding the lengths and breath of a system of hate-based ""Mis-Education"" of Blacks and the Architects behind the subterfuge."
3,Depends on what you need,"I've read the 2001 edition, not this newest one. But if you need a hard-core history review, this is still probably NOT the book for you. However, if you'd like more information about what test 10081 of the Praxis II series actually covers, then read this book. Technically, you don't really need to buy a copy if you can get a library to do an interlibrary loan for you since all you need to do is flip through the chapters on what the test covers and make some notes on what you need to review. The best part of the book, though, is the sample test. The one in the 2001 edition is 117 questions long (the real test is 130). Otherwise, this book is a big list of what to study, not an actual history textbook."
1,Not much to go on!!,Don't buy this book if you need a histroy review. It only contains an outline and a sample test. The book states that a person taking this section of the Praxis should buy some history text books. I should have done that instead of wasting my money on this worthless book!
2,Buy It From the Publisher,"Not real impressed with the book, but it is a required text for a staff development class. Do not pay $95 for this book! If, like me,you have to buy the book, go to the ETS website and order it for $30."
2,Not impressed at all.,"I was first introduced to Rachael Davis at the Smoky Hill River Festival in Salina, Kansas (where I'm from) back in 2005. Everyone kept raving about, ""oh, she's got a great voice and an extraordinary talent, and she's a great guitarist, blah, blah, blah"". Well, I bought the album taking everyone else's advice. I have met Rachael in person, and she is a very nice person and has a very sweet and sassy personality.Sorry to say, but I listened to the album for a good 5 to 10 minutes and it almost gave me a headache. It's nothing but just loud singing, screaming, straining, and shouting at the top of her lungs. And it is very boring to listen to. Nearly put me to sleep. Almost every song on here sounds pretty much the same.I was expecting better."
3,Very Pretty,"I bought this as a gift for my sister-in-law who plays bass guitar. It's very cute, but felt far too thin to ever work as a functional pick."
5,Contemplative,"A strange and ancient type of music. Imagine yourself in a coptic monastery surrounded by chanting monks. That is what you get in this CD. It may be an acquired taste, but it is a beautiful way to praise God. An eerie sound, but neat."
5,Goblins in the Castle,I love this story. I read it to my third graders every year in October. The students adore Igor and are mesmerized by the adventure William is sent on by Granny Pinchbottom. A true book about friendship and determination.
3,Could be much better,"This Dictionary could be much better. Reading its entries I found them skimpy , if not inaccurate. I checked out the entry for 'Israel' and there were two references to the Biblical Yaakov- Israel and not a word about the central place Israel plays in Jewish historical and religious consciousness."
3,Australian POV,"I found that although the CD was aimed at American students, most songs can be used in Australian classrooms as well. The lesson plans and lyrics that are also on the CD are also valuable."
3,the hunt,"The content is exactly what I wanted.However, as backing for a proposed advertising clip, the recording quality was pretty mediocre.Looks as if I will be forced to try another."
3,lacked pronunciation,I bought this dictonary for a trip to Ukraine and Russia but there was no translation of the pronunciation of the russian words so it was not very helpful for my purpose.
5,Like Heaven!!!,"This music is something else. It's like being in heaven or something like that. I was already familiar with the music of Palestrina but this...blowed my mind away. All the voices join in perfect harmony. If you like sacred choral music, then this is, buy it, besides, the price is ridiculus."
1,Absolutely no value to this book.,"This book is filled with pseudo-intellectual fluff. The author may very well have won an Ars Electronica award or whatever, but he is clearly terrible at putting his brilliant ideas on the written page. The writing is nearly mind-boggling in that there are very few words on the page, but those few contain almost no useful or insightful substance.I highly recommend that you continue your search for a book about interactivity; this seems like an industry person trying to dabble in writing, and failing."
2,"Good for the eye, bad for the brain, okay for the stomach","This is a beautiful text visually, and the author has done an excellent job of bringing together very interesting experiments in interactive design. However, his analysis, as several other reviewers have noted, really is best described as ""shallow."" His interpretations lack insight and the details examined seem selected randomly. The interviews he includes often lack proper contextualization, and I think he stretches the term ""narrative"" far too much, trying to subsume things like games and theater as narratives only, without attending to their game-ness or theatricality. The problem is that there aren't many other books dealing with this genre of work yet, so some readers will find it useful for the excellent example of interesting case studies at least until someone with better analysis writes a book. Theoretically, Marie Laure-Ryan's book on Narrative as Virtual Reality is also a good selection."
1,A combination of the completely obvious and obviously wrong,"""Pause & Effect"" is a mind-numbingly shallow book. Practically every observation the author makes in this book is either completely obvious or obviously wrong. Definitely NOT worth the money."
1,Completely shallow,This book is completely shallow. What a horrible hate crime against the rain forest to waste paper on a book like this. The author clearly thinks he's a complete genius but all he is doing is wrapping obvious observations about art and narrative in fancy text and adding artsy-fartst pictures. Spend you're hard-earned money elsewhere!!!
1,Masturbatory.,"Uses too many words to say too little. A pretty package with nothing inside. Provides a surface-level overview with few useful insights. A convoluted, academic fever dream."
5,Ready to go and engagine,This book is wonderful for teachers and students due to its applicability to almost any story or book. I use one each week with our weekly story and the children always find them engaging and fun.
2,Cool Design but.......,"Less than three months later, the cz diamonds started falling out, starting with the biggest one. Very sad now :("
4,Great post-rock album.,"65daysofstatic is a band who has managed to make creative and interesting post-rock. The songs on this album never get boring or repetitive. The instruments are used intricately and wisely to keep the listener intrigued. If you like Explosions in the Sky, Mogwai, Mono or any post-rock band, give this album a try. I think you'll love it."
3,What happened?,"This is not the 65daysofstatic I know and love. One Time For All Time is by far one of my favourite albums of all time. It's an absolute masterpiece with brilliant songs which are beautifully put together and sound absolutely amazing.The title of 65daysofstatic's latest album does the album justice. What have they done? The production values are brutal, the songs themselves don't do anything for me (after hearing Radio Protector from One Time For All Time, my expectations for this band are very high), and overall I'm disappointed with this album. Speaking figuratively, One Time For All Time moved me deeply, yet The Destruction of Small Ideas doesn't even budge me.I hate to give such a great band such a low rating, but I feel that I have to. Very disappointed. 3/5."
2,Not What I Expected...,"yes, i judge a book by its cover, and that's what attracted me to this book. then, reading that it takes place in baltimore, my home town, i decided to buy it for the local interest aspect.unfortunately, that was the only thing i really found redeeming about the book. it seemed more like a collection of short stories, jumping around from episode to episode in the main character's life. some of the episodes seemed too fantastic to make it a believable novel, and Adriane came across as too unrealistic. some of her actions made me cringe in embarrasment for her!i guess i was expecting more of a mid-life crisis novel set in baltimore, but i was sorely disappointed once i was done reading the book. i felt like it had no real storyline, and the character just wasn't believable to me."
5,Smart and Hilarious,"If this is chick lit, it is chick lit as written by Evelyn Waugh. Mandelbaum's fiction is dry, incisive and inventive. He knows that life is essentially tragic and just as essentially ridiculous, yet also somehow glorious. Adriane is the best kind of comic character, hilarious and deeply moving."
2,Tiny,"Couldn't help but laugh when I received it because it was so small. Don't know whether I got an actually tuning fork or a paperclip bent into one. It works however, I guess."
5,new edition,"David Sudnow's phenomenological study, as Hubert Dreyfus states in his introduction to The Rewritten Account, is an altogether unique piece of work. As a (former) piano player, it inspired me to learn a piece of Bach again just so I could rediscover, for myself, some of the phenomena Sudnow describes with such depth. As a casual reader of some of the major existential and phenemonological writers, it strikes me that Sudnow, more than anyone, shows us the phenomenological perspective at work. I haven't read the earlier Harvard edition, which I've been told is very difficult, but this version certainly isn't. It's a flowing account, told beautifully, and I am sure that it will become a classic. I hope Sudnow comes through on his promise and offers us a description of learning a second language. If he makes a contribution to language studies anything like Ways of the Hand makes to the study of handicraft, that would be extraordinary."
5,worth reading again,"Having just finished rereading David Sudnow's ""Ways of the Hand"" I am reminded of just how much I love this book. I think it is one of the most original books and is quite possibly the finest and most detailed record of skill acquisition ever written. I doubt that there is anyone who describes the details of things that we do the way Sudnow does. Although this is a difficult book, requiring careful examination, the rewards are well worth the effort. The uniquely descriptive language he has created is fascinating to follow as it unfolds in the course of his story. It is truly a combination of poetry and narrative. Sudnow creates an excitement in the discovery of why and how the hand can be the agent that delivers the inventions of any artist. Anyone interested in creativity and seeing how an artist comes to let his body take over and do its art should read this book. I loved it- one of the best books I've ever read."
4,excellent,I have been searching for this book for years . Now just need digital version so I can keep on my Kindle.
5,"Classic ""Go To"" Book for common Chinese herbal formulas",Easy to read reference on Traditional Chinese Medicine Patent Formulas. Lists contraindications and is indexed easily. Formulas such as Gan Mao Ling and Yin Chiao are discussed.
1,Is this a first draft?,"The content itself was very interesting.The entire book is short chapters of journal notes with the occasional splash of commentary thrown in.Badly written, poorly organized.He could have at least organized it chronologically.The constant way of making himself out to be some sort ofsuperhero got very annoying very quickly."
1,Keel the psychic critic,"I wouldn't put a dollar of my free cash in John Keel's pocket for this potboiler, particularly after reading his ignorant comments on a ""contactee"" of the 1960s whom he ""reviewed"" and brushed off without so much as a postcard of correspondence with his target. If this is how he ""researches"", I wouldn't trust him to get today's date right."
4,A Fortean Classic,"This book-originally released in 1970,gives a general overview of the unusual engimas left behind by previous civilizations (the pyramids and other lesser known wonders),theories on the evolution of man,ufo's, missing persons,and other oddities and attempts to tie it all together in one general thesis. Very entertaining. Keel is an excellent writer who will keep you turning the page. Somewhat lighter than Keel's other books- which makes it a good intro to a reader new to the authors work. It does jump around a bit. Apperently many of the chapters were cobbled together from magazine articles. However it still is a fascinating book,well worth reading"
4,"Never mind reviews! Buy this book, it's excellent!","I've just finished reading it and my perspective has expanded quite a bit. As a Christian I found the approach to Genesis illuminating and was pleased that the author drew many conclusions which I feel are compatible with my faith. I could not bring myself to give the book five stars, however, because after so many pages of exciting reading the ending is a great dissappointment. After the near-constant flow of interesting ideas, in the last few pages we are given a typical 1970 ""Age of Aquarius"" panegyric, full of praise for the alleged moral superiority of the hedonistic youth of the time. Instantly the book becomes very dated, and then it ends. If this happened earlier in the book I could have just considered it as history but as an ending it's a great let-down. It's still a wonderful book. I imagine that when I read his other books I'll give them all five stars!"
5,Life-changing Scholarship,"I loved this book. I trusted the author's scholarship and was fascinated to learn the history of ideas about God's body. I had no idea that the ancient Israelites probably assumed ""He"" had a body. I am grateful for this book. It changed how I think about the history of religion."
2,Not worth the money I paid....,"My son has more fun playing the games that are free on Sesame Street, Noggin, & Nick Jr. websites. This does not keep his attention....very poorly made."
5,MY CHILD LOVED THIS!!!,Awesome! Great for first time computer user's. Very educational for a preschooler. The only problem is that they grow out of it way too fast.
1,Don't be fooled by the picture!!,"The picture shows a spindle of discs, but what you actually get is ""ONE"" disc in ""ONE"" jewel case."
4,It really works!,It does do the job. Takes a little more effort than the ad makes it sound. Wish it had included what it couldn't be used on in the description.
5,Absolutely Awesome,"Oh my gosh!!! I am absolutely amazed. I too was at wit's end. I was so frustrated after trying so many different things and nothing working. I read reviews on Spot X and I felt like it had to be the ""one"". It was the ""ONE""! My glass shower door looks brand new. It did take about an hour to get it all cleaned and in some places I had to apply it twice but it was well worth it. I am going to order more so I will always have it if I need it. This is a miracle cleaner!!!"
1,hard water spots,"This product does not work, I have glass shower doors, are water is hard, and really they were not that bad, and it does not remove the water stains."
1,Total Garbage,This stuff is total garbage. Maybe it might work on very light hard water residue but if it could work at all you would need more than the little pad they give you to work with. YOU WOULD NEED AN ELECTRIC SANDER!!! HORRIBLE!!!!
1,USELESS,"Difficult to apply and very little improvement on the windscreen, even after doing the same operation twice. I do not recommend this product. Too expensive for what it is and definitely not worth it."
1,"Reviews are fake, this product does not work",Looks like positive reviews are fake. I wasted my money on this product and couldn't remove any water stains no matter how hard I tried.
4,Works!,"So far, this is the only water spot/stain remover that I think actually works. I definitely recommend buying this product."
2,Spot X,Spot X did a decent job but it did not really get out the hard water shower glass stain as I had hoped. It did better than anything else but does not remove hard water stains.
3,"Ok, but not great.","This worked ok, but Barkeepers Friend worked better on my auto glass. Just be careful to not get this stuff or BKF on your paint, and if you do, just rinse it off, don't wipe it off.BKF was about 5x less than this and did a better job."
4,Sprinkler Water Stains,"I bought the product to get the stains off of my wifes car window. With some rubbing, the stain came off!"
5,Removes ocean salt from car windows!,"I live next to the ocean in San Francisco. I had heavy salt stains on my windshield. I tried 3 separate products that 'promised' to remove the stain. None of them worked at all. I finally picked up Spot-X, followed the mixture instructions and it worked. My truck no longer has salt stains on the windshield. This product is awesome!"
1,Didn't work for me,"Maybe these water stains are just too badly etched, but this product didn't get them off my shower doors. I ordered it because we'd tried a bunch of other products (spray-on cleaners, Barkeeper's Friend, SOS pads, soaking in vinegar, Soft Scrub, baking soda paste, etc) and nothing worked. I precisely followed the directions and scrubbed like CRAZY with the enclosed pad. The directions tell you to scrub in a small area at a time - even if it only took a minute to actually work, it would still take a long time to do just one door. But I tried in the same area multiple times, scrubbing and scrubbing, and MAYbe it looks SLIGHTLY different, though still stained."
5,"Spot-X, The Real Deal People!!!!!","I bought a new car this past weekend and didn't notice that there were water spots on most of the windows because it rained the whole day I purchased the car. Needless to say the next day I discovered the issue and attacked it with every product that I could buy at the store. Nothing worked, not even white vinegar or CLR. This product knocked those water spots right off. I couldn't believe it when I saw the results. The glass looked fantastic. I'm a true believe and will forever use Spot-X, I already ordered another bottle even though I only used a 1/4 of the first one I bought. You never know when they might stop selling it. Don't waste your time and money on inferior products that don't work. Just buy it and I promise you won't be disappointed."
3,"It works, BUT . . .","This product did succeed in cleaning hard water spots off the windshield of my old BMW, but as another reviewer stated, it DID leave scratches. I used their ""non-scratch"" pad, followed the directions, etc., but it did leave minute ""spider-web"" scratches, most visible when the sun is directly shining through the windshield. Granted, my car has 165,000 miles on it, and the windshield already has numerous small rock chips in it, so in my case, the scratches are better than the water stains, but if I tried this product on a newer car and it did this (although the product claims it is safe on windshields), I would be very angry indeed."
2,Didn't work,I bought this product hoping it would remove hard water stains from my car windows. I did everything according to the directions but no luck. They must be very ingrained in the glass or something but I have been unable to find anything that removes the spots. Good luck to others.
5,Yea! It actually works,"We've had this 1991 Acura for about 4 years and I've never been able toget the hard water spots off the glass. Doesn't look like the past 2 or 3previous owners even tried.Good news is, SPOT-X did the job. Even the black border that runs aroundthe rear hatch glass. Those hard water stains were baked on because theblack gets really hot. Finally even they're gone. Can't say enough goodthings about this product....it definitely does what they claim."
4,A very impressive product,"I purchased Spot-X several weeks ago as a last ditch attempt to get the hard water spots off my clear glass frameless shower door. When applied as recommended by the manufacturer - that is as a thick paste - the product, unbelievably, worked. I was surprised but pleased with the results. I wish that the manufacturer would list at least the active ingredients on the package because it's always nice to know what it is that you're handling, but other than that it worked great and cleaned up with little to no problem. Thanks Spot-X."
2,"It works, but.......","Bought this to remove Hard Water spots from auto glass. It works. However, be prepared for lots of elbow greese. I attach the pad to a jitter bug sander, as directed, still have to work at it.I won't reorder this. I discovered a better way.RHR"
3,Needs a Lot of Elbow Grease or Sander to Possibly Work,"After trying everything on hard water stains on my car windows, I decided to give this a shot. Well, it worked better than anything else, but there are still a significant amounts of hard water streaks on my windows. So while I acknowledge its the best thing I've used thus far, I had to scrub my windows for about 10 minutes each for 1 square foot of area and only obtained slightly improved windows. So perhaps I have hardcore water stains, or this product must be used in conjunction with a lot of free time on a weekend or a rotary sander."
3,NOT THAT GREAT,"It's just O.K. I was disappointed with the size of the product; it's in a very small bottle. I also don't find it to be as wonderful as described by other reviewers. I have obscured glass in my shower and after using the Spot-X, it still looks streaked and cloudy. Maybe I'm applying it incorrectly. Bottom line, I will not buy it again, nor will I recommend it to anyone."
3,"OK, but not easy to use.",It is effective eventually but requires a lot of work on heavy stains.Didn't really find it any more effective than Heavy Duty rubbing compoundfrom the autoparts store (and that you can use with a polisher).
3,"Removes spots, but scratches glass","At first I was really excited since the product was working. After countless hours and every product imaginable, our hard water stains were coming off the shower glass doors. Unfortunately, once I was finished and the glass dried I noticed scratches everywhere. And yes, I used the pad provided.The product worked great on the shower metal, including the faucet without leaving scratches. That is why I am giving the product 3 stars."
5,You won't be disappointed!!!,"It's difficult to find products these days that make promises and actually deliver! I just finished using this product on auto glass that was badly damaged by hard water spotting...WOW! An easy to use, exceptional product."
1,Disappointment,This was recommended to me for hard water stains on the shower doors of my new condo. We have used it several times and the doors look the same. I had great hopes but this product did not work for me.
5,"I was doubtful, but now I'm a believer","I bought this for two reasons. #1, my new Volt had some water spots on the windshield that I could not get off. (Tried the vinegar thing and all sorts of cleaners). #2, my Dodge Ram pickup has been brutalized by the neighbors sprinklers and had some serious water spots on the passenger side windows. Spot-x is a miracle. I first tried it on a small section of the Volt and with a little scrubbing, I could see the spots disappear. I finished the windshield and then went after the truck. Wow. It took a bit of work getting the right consistency of water & power solution, but this stuff just works. It cleared up the windows on the truck like they are brand new. I never would have thought it would turn out to be that easy. 5 stars all the way!"
5,A-MA-ZING!!!,"This stuff WORKS! FInally, something that does. Just a little scrubbing (very little!) and you can see through your windshield clearly again!"
2,Didn't do the Job,"Based on the great reviews, I purchased the product to remove hard water stains on a plate glass shower enclosure. The product was able to remove the ""roughness"" of the built-up residue but the underlying stain still remained."
3,Don't expect magic,"I had badly etched water spots on the back window of a Toyota hatchback. Spot-X worked to some degree, but protective properties aside, no better than Bon Ami and 000 steel wool, which was much cheaper. Expect to use a great amount of elbow grease with either."
5,Excellent Product!,"My windows were long exposed to a combination of powerful sprinkles, very hard well water and harsh New Mexico sun. Some of them are so bad you have hard time seeing through due to cloudiness that has built up. I've tried everything including Zud, BarKeepers, CRL Water Spot Remover, The Works Toilet Bowl Cleaner and a few more (forget about Lime-Away - don't even bother!)... Not that they didn't work at all - they did a decent job, but the cloduness never went away completely, so the windows still looked dirty. Just when I almost gave up, I discovered Spot-X. This little bottle did a pretty miraculous job getting rid of residue cloudiness!!!"
1,Spot-X Isn't.,"This product is the least saisfactory item I've ever purchased on the internet.Poorly packaged, the cleaning pad touted in the description is nothing more than what can be purchased for pennies in any store.I tossed this out almost immediately and regretted the entire transaction."
3,"Works OK, but a simpler and much cheaper solution exists","I bought this and followed directions with pretty good results on one side of car with HEAVY glass stains. It was difficult for me to get the hang of getting the powder/water mixture just right...after a time I caught on but was still leery of using an abrasive pad on my windows. As I was using it I remarked at how similar the product was to BarKeepers Friend, which we use to clean our glass cooktop. After consulting the BarKeeps Friend website, I discovered that Bar Keepers Friend could be used on glass with no scrub pad needed. So, I got out our can, got a cloth nice and damp, sprinkled a little Bar Keepers on it, and proceeded to clean the windows on other side of the vehicle using alot less product resulting in less mess and effort. Again, Spot X worked OK but BarKeepers Friend was easier to use and is less than $5 (at grocery stores) for a 12 ounce can."
1,save your money,"Not worth the money, tried this product on an old car of mine that has water stained windows without any luck. I folowed the directions and tried the product several times without results."
1,Disappointed!!!,I had high hopes that this would remove the haze from the glass lids on my pots and pans. I scrubbed and scrubbed and it didn't remove the haze. I' m really disappointed in this product. Hopefully I can find some other use for it around my house so my money won't be totally wasted.
2,Sorry Didn't Work for Me!,"i was excited when I found this product and read the outstanding reviews. I ordered here and eagerly applied it! I applied it and applied it for days and now months later, it still doesn't work. Not even a little. Nothing does no matter how much elbow grease I put into it. I have hard water build-up on my shower doors which are glass. It is terribly ugly and looks dirty but nothing will take this off. This product maybe makes a teeny slight dent in it but nothing to declare it works like it says it will."
5,Spot-X is spot on!,"This is a fantastic product! I didn't know something like this was available, so I'm glad I looked and found Spot-X. It went on easily, and only took one light application to make my car windows crystal clear! It only takes a couple of tablespoons to do the whole car, so you'll have a lot left for other projects. Try it, you won't be sorry!"
4,Works with a lot of effort,"I had been warned by other reviews that a lot of rubbing was necessary to get results. That is indeed true. I did succeed to get some old glass window panes clear but it took a lot of effort. At least I did get good results, which I had not been able to do before."
1,Obsolete item,"This item does not work with Xbox 360 and I suspect does not work with xbox either. It's support has been discontinued with the xbox franchise. When you put it in the xbox 360 console it refers you to the xbox site. The xbox site lists older games that are still supported, this one is not on the list. Xbox live lists a newer version, for purchase of course. If you have recently been able to run this on the older xbox system, I would appreciate knowing. However, I learned the hardway, it will not work, and can not be patched/upgraded/etc. to work on the xbox 360. Sellers are misleading you by selling this obsolete product."
4,Great Utility,"I use these sheets for my bed in a fraternity house, good for anybody who needs a nice looking set of sheets."
3,Fun sheets,These sheets are fun. Can't help but feel good looking at them. They seem to be well made and the price is right.
2,"do the job, but costly","I bought these when i moved to college, they are not soft at all, and have an new smell to them for quite a while ( about a week), its pretty anoying, especially when trying to settle into a new place. I have not washed them yet, Hopefully they will soften up. THey were also way to expensive, and ugly, i got better looking sheets in twin xl at walmart for $5. Look elsewhere for sheets."
4,"Twin sheets not as ""peaceful"" as promised","OK...with 200 thread count, I knew these sheets weren't going to be top quality. But they do have a nice feel. The problem is that my daughter has a 12-inch memory foam mattress and they barely fit. As a matter of fact, the fitted bottom sheet frequently pops off because the pocket isn't deep enough. Amazon says it's a 17-inch pocket; the package says 12-inch. But in reality it's more like a 10-inch pocket. Other than that, for the price these are nice."
3,Sub-standard pockets on the fitted sheet.,"I needed the ""deep pockets"" advertised for these sheets but was disappointed by the actual amount of cloth that goes under the mattress. If you have a ""pillow top"" I would recommend that you look elsewhere. Still better than most - at least they publish the pocket ""depth""."
5,"Good quality, as described",My son has been using thses sheets fro way to long and he loves them. Not bad for the price.
5,Great sheets.,Great sheets!I loved these sheets. Great for the kids bed. Looks as it is on line. What more can I say
4,russell camo pants,i wear a size 34x32 cinch jeans and the medium size russell outdoor explorer fit snuggly at the waist and great in the leg. i think if i was going to wear a base layer under them i would need to have the next size up to be comfortable or i could always lose 5 lbs but thats unlikely to happen.
5,Light but sturdy feeling,"These are rather lightweight, but the fabric feels very sturdy. I'm a big guy (6ft 315lbs) so I was a little worried about the sizing. I wear a 48"" blue jeans and these were a little tight (not uncomfortable) around the waist. I could have skipped the belt and they would have stayed up. They're not too noisy, but I've owned quieter pants."
4,Good,"I got these pants in medium after reading some reviews. I wouldn't call the midweight they are pretty light. I usually wear a 32w34L in jeans and I had plenty of room in the waist and length was pretty good. I have only washed them once and they didn't shrink much, but will see after a few more washes."
5,ggreat light weight pants,Not sure about the strength of stitching yet but the weight and design are perfect for the bow/dove/quail seasons here in new Mexico
2,Item is nice but lots of flaws,"These pants were great when I first wore them, held up on the hunt for the day great, but with one wash very gentle and and washed with like colors (other hunting gear) the pants lost almost all of their color, very disappointed"
2,Didn't fit...,"Bought them for my son who is a 35"" waist. Other posts say these run large. The medium did not fit him. Offering pants in sizes like S,M,L,XL,etc. makes it difficult to know which to purchase. At least give a range in inches that each size is meant to fit. I have returned them, but no refund at this writing. Ordered the large and got an email back that these pants are no longer being offered."
4,Good product. Price too high though.,"Russel makes a good product. Don't understand why Russells prices have gone up so much. Remember when Russell had very good prices, not anymore."
5,Great shocks and a Super Deal!,"Bought these for my '98 Isuzu Amigo 2WD. Front end went all over the place and felt like I was gonna break some disks in my lower back when I'd hit a bump in the road! I bought these because they are nitrogen charged and the price was unbelievable. Bought these as soon as I found them here. Regrettably, I couldn't get the rears for the same good price so I opted for some other nitrogen filled shocks from Monroe (quality/price ratio thing). My Amigo is really an ""amigo"" now, installed all 4 in 30 to 40 minutes! Forget Optimus Prime - Amazon Prime is the only way to go (no shipping, no taxes and delivered in 2 days!). What else can you say for scooping up top-shelf shocks that retail for appox. $80 each and I got 'em for $15 ea. Whoa! WTF Chuck, over! Hella deal, Neal!"
2,Flimsy,"I don't recommend this mouse. It is very cute, just the right size, and a great idea. But the wire that it uses in order to spool up is very thin. If you are like me and a bit casual how you use it, you will walk around with the mouse plugged into your USB port but hanging by that wire. Before long, the plastic coating on the wire tears, exposing raw metal. Then it shorts out and your computer crashes. Of course, if you are super careful never to put any stress on that wire, your mileage may differ. Also, I typically have to click this mouse 2 or 3 times for my computer to register one click. I decided instead to go with a Microsoft Wireless Mouse 6000, which I just love. No wires. No need to use one mouse when the laptop is docked and another when walking around. No missing clicks."
4,Nice product,"It's a nice product, but the retractable wheel leaves a little to be desired; it doesn't wind tight and easily snags. A small mouse, perfect for traveling light. I'm happy with my purchase."
1,Great mouse while it lasts--but mine died after 2 months,"I really loved this mouse--it was easy to use, highly responsive and comfortable to work with. But the left mouse button failed after only 2 months, so I cannot recommend it."
2,This broke very quickly,I loved the idea of this - it is tiny and very cute. However the little sticky pads came the first day so it was unbalanced and not well protected - it scraped my glass desk and was hard to use. The light in the little hole in the back is blinding (I have sensative eyes so maybe I am just less tolerable to that) but it was super annoying - especially in a dark room.It just didn't work well and it stopped responding after 2 months of use - I would have thought it would have lasted longer than that. I recommend the Targus brand. When I get one of those it lasts for years!!
3,Not an exercise routine,"This is good only if you want to learn how to dance, not if you're going to use dance as a way of exercise.Karen goes a little fast, so I got frustrated after a while and turned it off. She spends longer on the easy moves, but flies through the difficult ones.I reccommed Jennifer Gardalini(spelling of last name) if you want to dance for an actual purpose."
1,BOO,Dont buy this. I love dancing and can get into alot of things but this dvd was just plain terrible!
5,Thrilling and easy!,"Excellent! She is great and makes the whole dancing thing so easy. I love the choreography and steps. It's different, challenging, fun and professional. I loved it!"
3,Not for Beginners,"Street fusion dvd is not so easy to do. It starts with a dance for beginners. But definitely its not for beginners. Karen Gayle teaches so fast that you can't follow all the moves. It would be better if she can teach slower. But the choreography is good. If you know how to dance Hip-hop, its ok for you."
3,Too hard for me.,"I'm not a young woman, but I usually catch on pretty quickly. This video was too hard for me to follow and I gave up frustrated. It would be great for someone who is younger, fitter, and has some hip hop dance in their blood. For me, I was never trained in hip hop and never even tried it, so it was just beyond me."
4,Worth the little amount it cost,Product delivered exactly what was promised. Easy to follow- gives a good work out and helps to develop skill.
3,"Decent, but...","This is definitely better than Oath and Measure, so if you're reading the Meetings Sextet in order then at least things improve. The meeting between Tanis and Kitiara is VERY lacking in drama--they simply fall into each others arms in a mixture of battle and unexpected lust. This should have been handled much more carefully.The non-Chronicles characters are extremely enjoyable in the sense that they add a depth to the novel and allow it to be an original story. However, the plot itself isn't very complex--a bad guy wants power, yawn. Also, there are almost too many other characters--I felt like the dynamic between the two mages could have been its own novel, but Ellen was ""forced"" to write about Tanis and Kit instead. As a result, neither relationship is developed appropriately.Still, a decent read with good characters in a great realm."
2,"""Meetings Sextet"" Limps Along With This Below Average Book","""Steel and Stone"" is the fifth addition to the ""Meetings Sextet""--a series that showed hints of early promise before falling flat and running out of gas. In this book, Ellen Porath--who had written the average first book in the sextet with another writer--takes on covering the meeting between Tanis Half Elven and Kitiara, two of the chief characters in the saga. What should have been an interesting tale falls flat as the book wanders off in too many directions, including a cast of solid secondary characters who, while charming, do little to move the plot along and a strange, convoluted epic journey. There is almost nothing that stands out in this book and little to commend it. ""Steel and Stone"" is one more below average Dragonlance book that most fans of the saga can miss without missing a beat."
3,Not very exciting,"Tanis should have known better than to have gotten involved with Kitiara Uth Matar, but he did, and this book tells the tale of how all this gets worked out. And of course there is another man involved with Kitiara. And there's fighting. And some backstabbing. And a strange trip to Icereach. This book was okay. Not the best in the Meetings Sextet. Read it if you like the characters involved. A little of the plot becomes important later on in the Dragonlance Series. It might be interesting to know the background details from this book."
1,Not at all what you would expect.....,"This book is all wrong. To say the least i am quite disappointed with Mrs. Ellen Porath. Maybe I expected to much ; judging from the initial success of ""Kindred Spirits"" i was hoping she could assimilate that kind of energy into this one. She failed miserably. And on an important dragonlance mytho like this. The meetings sextet should be books on how the companions 1st met. Sure, Tanis and Kitiara met but the relationship stopped at their intoduction to each other. It didn't have the chance to grow since one of Kitiara's old flames were also one of the key characters of the story. Kit was to bias for my liking. The story never takes off and leaves you where you started in the 1st place."
3,Good book,"Good book, plain and simple. Not the best but still good. If your a Dragonlance fan you'll enjoy the read."
5,The funniest movie I've ever seen,"I've seen countless movies, comedies, etc...but this is the only one I laugh at EVERY time I watch it...I litterally will have tears streameing down my cheeks from laughter, every time...even though I've seen it a jillion times."
5,great book for any runner,"If you are a runner for nontrivial amount of time, you are very likely to experience some sort of injury already. I did. And I hope I could have bought and read this book before I started running.The book covers many common forms of injuries experienced by runners, and gives several treatments you can practice in home. Even if you do see a doctor later, the book is an excellent introduction to what happens to your injury so you can coordinate with your doctor in a more helpful way.The book is written in a very plain and easy to follow way which is a big plus for non-medical background person like me.I recommend this book to any runner. If you just start running or plan to run, buy and read this book. You won't regret it and could avoid many possible painful results."
3,Too big.,"Bigger than I thought it would be. And as such a big case, it doesn't hold that much of stuff. Not too happy with it, but what the hell, it's an IBM, that's cool enough."
3,No Moisture Recovery For Me,"I am an older female with dry, thick, coarse hair and thought this would do the trick to give me back some much needed moisture but it didn't. I rate it a 3 for this reason however when my hair is short it seems to work great. I will continue to purchase this product."
2,Doesn't seem to do much of anything,This shampoo is ok... Nothing special... Didn't really add any moisture in my hair like it was supposed to. I will go back to Nexxus Shampoo for sleek and smooth hair. It moisturizes a lot better than this product... Probably will not purchase again.
1,so bad it almost funny,Do not buy this movie! The 3D is terrible (but you get 4 pairs of the old 3D cardboard glasses!) and the movie is even worse. Totally silly and not at all scary-just stupid. I got it just to try out my new 3D TV and BluRay 3D player and it didn't even do that very well (it only worked with the cheap cardboard glasses!).
5,SUCTION SOAP HOLDER,"This is a wonderful device. It keeps the soap dry and out of the way. It is not a permanent solution - when the suction cup releases and the holder falls, it can break. At the price, just consider it a disposable."
2,missing parts,"Bought two of these items and they both were missing the suction cups.This item is made cheap, but you get what you pay for."
3,Not bad.,"Cheap brittle plastic. One showed up cracked by the suction cup and sometimes slips out if Im not careful. Good design and inexpensive, it works well for my needs."
2,cheap construction,"Bought 2 of these. One is fine, the other broke after less than one week of use. The hole where the unit attaches to the suction cup seems to be too big, making the holster fall off when putting a bar of soap in it. At this price, should have been better quality."
5,The Wilderness Family.,"I [hve] dreams of visiting Africa. Kobie Kruger's brilliant review of life in the African bush has deeply moved me and made me more serious and determined to travel to Africa's vast Kruger National Park. Her words paint a beautiful picture of Africa and it's animals. I laughed at how she overcame small problems, and cried at the hardest problem of all - giving up their beautiful lion Leo. She writes in a way that makes you want to know more. She tells of the bad points of living in the bush, but the good points outweigh them by far. She talks about their home for years at the Malangheni Ranger Station in the North-West Region of Kruger National Park. Her description of her home is beautiful and makes you wish you could jump into the book to see it for yourself. Her light sense of humour, and her ability to make you feel part of the family are just some of the qualities that make this book the best book I have ever read."
4,"A Wonderful, Well-Told Story","I devoured this book cover to cover. It's well written and a wonderful story of the author's time at Kruger National Park in South Africa. You'll laugh with her, cry with her, be frightened with her, and be amazed by her experiences. My only complaint was that - when finished - I simply wanted more of this book."
5,A grateful mother loved this book!,"Having recently sent my son off to a therapeutic wilderness program, I was very grateful for the excellent view this book gave me about my son's experience. Other reviewers have criticized this book for being too ""Shirley MacLaine"" in its description of the program. But my viewpoint is quite different. I saw the same results that the author reported. My son was transformed from an angry, defiant, miserable young man to a strong, trusting teen. We aren't at the end of the journey for my son, but I can't begin to tell you how beneficial the wilderness program was to my son. Although the author's descriptions of his experiences with the troubled teens may sound unbelievable or simply trite, they are undoubtedly true. If you are a parent of a troubled teen, this book will give you an excellent view of an alternative treatment program."
2,Nice Try - But No Cigar!,"As an avid reader of outdoor literature and magazines, I happened across this book by chance and was intrigued by the premise. But, I was sadly disappointed when I started to read. The author's story was vaguely interesting, but the jacket copy was much better written than the text. The jacket copywriter should have been given the task for chronicling this outdoor program and maybe it would have been more compelling and readable. I give this book two stars for effort because at least the author tried but overall nothing new, groundbreaking or interesting here that can't be seen or heard on any daytime talk show."
1,Disappointing,"Doesn't come close to the wonders of a Paul Theroux or Aldo Leopold, etc. Save your money."
1,A bore...,"The Kirkus review says ""At its worst, it's like being stuck on a long camping trip with Shirley MacLaine.""Please, does anybody have Shirley MacLaine's phone number? I'm not convinced a camping trip with her could be as bad as this book."
1,Complete Crap,"I know some of the people that have come back from these programs more messed up than when they left. ""It's worse than being in jail"" seems to be a common report on their experiences. The book is a propaganda tool to disguise this brainwash prison camp as a ""back to nature"" experience. Nothing more than an advertisement for a mutli-million dollar industry."
2,More of a promotion than anything else.,"The whole book seems like one big plug for the teen wilderness program. Its too bad that parents will pick up this book and think these places are such a healing place, when many teens actually die at these places each year."
5,Rare insight into a little-known world . . .,"Having worked for years with at-risk teens, I can't tell you how pleased I was to stumble across this book. As far as I know this is the first time any outdoor writer has gone beyond a one-dimensional look at outdoor therapy (which usually shows up as a finger-pointing piece about some bad program caught abusing kids), to give an honest, and altogether accurate portrayal of how it feels to be on the ground with kids struggling for their very lives.As Dr. Michael Gass, one of the nation's premier experts on adventure therapy put it, (Ferguson's book) ""led me to hug my own children a bit tighter and think about my investment in them as a parent."" And that's high praise indeed."
1,Fluff,"I went to Aspen and was abused by the staff. It horrifies me how these programs go to any length to manipulate parents into thinking these programs can be beneficial. If you google ""Wilderness Program"" and even ""Aspen Achievement Academy"" you will find a plethora of reports of abusive practices. Aspen owns many programs-- many of which have been shut down for teen deaths from dehydration, deadly restraints, and heat exaustion. Anyone who raves about this book is giving into the scandal. Check out recent bills in congress ie. Hr911 and Hr 4247. At least now things are being done to stop these predators and alert parents."
4,Shouting at the Sky,Excellent reference for description of wilderness therapy for troubled teens. Logs and daily activities of actual participants.
3,Interesting but lacked depth,"With a daughter in a program similar to the one depicted in the book I read it with great interest. It did give me a lot of information about why these programs are successful, and what my daughter might be doing daily in the program. However it did lack depth and continuity. The style of writing is also not to my particular liking, although others may enjoy this flowery style."
5,a fascinating book everyone should read,I was brought up in Hong Kong and most of the stories in the Chinese Super Psychics I have already heard about. My grandfather read stories of chinese children who can read from their ears to me when I was very young. Its funny how I came across these stories again in an English book years later. What can I say here !!! I enjoyed reading this book from the beginning till the end and I am reading it for the forth time.This book also helps me to open my mind and keep on asking question about Qi and the universe. I recommand anyone to read it. Especially if you are working in the field of healing.
3,Neat book,"This is a cool book about the possibilities of human potential. However it is very propagandic as well as wanting you to accept everything that was written without a shread of proof or the use of the scientific method. I read the book several times and do enjoy it, however it could be alot better and without all the ""China is so great because we have powerful psycics"" crud."
2,Interesting Book on China's Psychics according to Paul Dong,"This book asks the reader to take practically everything the author says as fact. Many of the ""Wonders"" described are opening flower blossom's, using PK to move pills out of a sealed bottle, reading words (characters) in sealed envelopes, mass healings, and catching clothes on fire. I might be wrong, but any good stage magician can replicate these AND pull a rabbit out of a hat!The foreward to the book is laughable, something I would expect to find in a ""South Park"" novel. Really..If you can get past all of that, there is some interesting information to be found. If you're into Psychic Healing, Chi-Gong and the concepts of Chi, this book is worth a look.I would be interested in seeing a Chi-Gong demonstration if one came to my city of Las Vegas."
3,Abridged Too Far,Awful audio adaptation of what was probably a better book. A good idea concerning the life of Captain Kirk's father is abridged so much that the plot breaks down. It winds up being just a straight line story with very few plot twists worth mentioning. James Doohan's voice talents are wasted on an exceedingly short presentation.
5,The Best Guidebook for Historic Istanbul,"If I could recommend any book for someone interested in having a serious and detailed guidebook of Istanbul, then this would be it. This book organizes the historical monuments in the city by time period and provides handy maps. The real value of this book however, is the great detail that is given in describing what is found at each monument. With this book, you would not need a tour guide. The book also contains interesting sections on Iznik, Bursa and Edirne. A reminder though that this book does not try to give details about accommodations, restaurants, or contain colour pictures of the monuments described."
1,"Terrible drive, useless support","When I received this drive everything seemed fine...I plugged it in via USB 2.0 since I didn't have the Firewire 400 cable I needed and it worked, albeit with a slow transfer speed. After I purchased the cable a few weeks later, however, the drive failed to mount when connected via Firewire. I contact iomega's support via their online interactive chat and the support person informed me that the first thing I needed to do was plug the drive directly into a wall outlet instead of into a power strip; apparently these drives are extremely sensitive to power fluctuations (already not a good sign). I don't know about you, but with my setup that's just not possible and I told him so and asked what other avenues we could explore. There were none. That was it. If I couldn't plug the drive into a wall outlet he couldn't help me. I'm returning the drive."
1,Dead on Arrival,"Need I say more. Maybe you'll have better luck. (also, the software CDs that came with the drive were WARPED and unreadable.)"
2,Transcribed lectures,"This book was apparently taken from a series of lectures by Ms. Dawn and Mr. Peterson, and it shows. There is little continuity between the chapters, and it reads like a series of transcribed lectures. The book contained a good deal of Biblical exegesis on the pastorate, but I was disappointed in that it didn't do much to apply that to the real world of pastoring. Buy and read Peterson's other books, but skip this one."
5,The Real World,Iwago has brought to us breathtaking photos of the Lion....in their world.........the glory and the defeat of this most powerful animal clearly portrayed. I am always awed by Iwago's ability as a photographer......he has a special gift for capturing animals on film and In The Lion's Den is solid evidence of his talent !!
4,Love Picture Reader Books,"I love to read Picture Reader books with my 2 1/2 yr old daughter because she thinks she can read along with me (when the pictures come up in the book) and she is very proud of herself. Most of the picture reader stories are silly stories, but entertaining for the little ones."
5,The Goo Goo Dolls Are Here To Stay,"After thirteen years of struggling with labels, etc., and five albums later. The GGD find Sucess to be sweet. The single Slide off the the six and highly anticipated album, has shown fans around the world the rare music treasure that has feed the underbelly of AlternaRock for more then a decade. I think ""Dizzy up the Girl"", will turn alot of new fans on to what so many already know of."
5,"""I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete!""","Slide is by far the best song I've heard in a LONG time! It's worth it!!! It's up-beat, and relaxing, but also wakes you up. It's the all-around best bet for any music listener."
3,Good Start but not what I was looking for...,"I just ordered and received this book for a MFA Thesis project I am working on and, unfortunately, it is not what I was hoping for. The book is well written and easy to read, but I found the myths very heavily based around Loki and not any of the other main gods. Of course there is a great section on Odin, but Thor is conspicuously missing from a majority of the text. I think many will find it a good beginning to Norse Mythology, but I was hoping for something a little more well rounded."
5,Captivating and Entertaining,"I bought this book thinking it would be a difficult-to-understand translation of the norse myths, as I've found in other books. How surprised was I to find that the stories are actually re-written to sound much like a children's book! I kept thinking that it reads like Harry Potter as I was rushing through the pages. This is definitely one of my favorite books on Norse mythology due to the refreshing flavor the author has put back into these ancient stories. One could easily read through this book in three days, and have felt like they've been on a great adventure in the end. I hope to see more books like this one in my studies, and I will be sure to recommend it to all of my friends - some have bought and read it, and loved it just as much! Well worth the affordable price!"
5,"New, as described. Quick ship. Thank you!","Easy, entertaining edition of nordic mythology. The base and inspiration for Wagner operas, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and other tales of fantasy and drama. A must read."
4,"A very good, overall pool of Norse Mythology","After seeing a recent infamous movie, I was very interested in the real mythologies associated with these film representatives. I was not disappointed. I was extremely pleased with the stories within and their presentation. The classic illustrations are a nice addition. It's true this book seems written for a younger audience, however it is enjoyable for all ages. I would highly recommend this as a solid introduction into the realm of Norse mythology."
4,interesting to say the least,"This particular book is great for studying up on Nordic mythology or simply just reading for the enjoyment of it. The reading is strait forward but all of the names of people, places, and things can be a bit confusing because you read them once in the biggining of the book, along with many other long and strange names and don't come across them until many pages later, which causes you to look back and try and see what or who that thing was. But other than that, it is a very satisfying read and is strongly recommended as a good introduction for anyone who wishes to learn about the ancient Norse culture."
4,Nordic myths,"I haven't finished this book yet but I am enjoying the basics of the Nordic myths in this book. It's a good introduction to these stories and in plain, simple language. There are a few graphics to help tell the stories."
3,A good CD but the original is better and is available,"This still a good CD with only ten of the original songs of Brenda Lee's ""Merry Christmas from Brenda Lee"" Album. The songs that are missing are ""Santa Claus is comming to town"" and ""Frosty the snowman"" The ten remaining songs are probably more rememorable. I highly recomend the remastered original version titled ""Rocking aroung the christmas tree"" It contains all twelve songs plus six extra songs. It may cost more but, it is worth the money. The reason I gave the Jingle Bell Rock CD three stars is because this other , more complete, version is available"
5,the spirit of Christmas,This music always gives me the true joyful feeling of christmas. Takes me back to younger days. Sure to lift your spirits if you were a teenager in the 50's. hearty recommend.
1,"Low price, but poor quality",I ordered 3 of these for my kids to use on long trips and was very disappointed when I opened up the boxes to find the batteries included were all corroded & leaking.
2,DS ACCESSORY KIT-BLUE,IT IS GREAT TO TAKE WITH YOU WHEN YOU LEAVE HOME AND YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO CONTINUE PLAYING.
5,Yummy in my tummy,"Great texture, does not get gummy or mushy in the water. Nice vegetable taste. Fun to cook with."
3,Look in Other Places for Information on Senarens,"While this ""biography"" is impressive in its seemingly comprehensive list of Senarens' work, it's short on details about the man. The Amazon page says it's 24 pages long. It sure doesn't seem that long to me. I think you could find much better information--or at least the same information--in other places that deal with science fiction. I wouldn't spend $9.95 on it."
1,It stinks,"I used this textbook for my class and I was dissapointed. It is written for a 6th grader. 70 percent of the book is example and the definition are so simplistic that my dog would understand. Furthermore, the number of lists never ends! Get a different book"
3,Music too loud,"Really like the sound of her voice and the CD in general, HOWEVER, the backgroundmusic is too loud. It is distracting...makes it difficult to hear the narrator."
5,A remarkable woman,"Anna Mae Coleman is my great-grandmother. She was an incredible woman and I miss her deeply. The stories she told me were incredible. The strength of her was, is very inspiring. This book is a testiment to her life and how thing really were in the days when she was a young lady. I am also deeply touched by her daughter, Shirley Coleman Wells. I miss her very much as well as she has also passed on. Though they may not be here in body, but they will always live on in spirit."
2,Teaches Kids to Swear,"I was disappointed after reading this book. Every time the farmer's tractor breaks down, he swears. Its cutesy swearing. For example ""Oh, dollups of dung, the blim blam blade has broken!"" I've heard worse, but I don't want my 5 year old to go around saying ""Oh, dollups of dung!"" For those parents who wish to teach their kids to talk intelligently, this is not the book for you."
4,Inuyasha Volume 3,"This book was good in the typical Inuyasha style. There was a touch more nudity than usual, so if you are hyper-sensitive to that sort of thing, you may want to skip it. Despite that minor snag, I personally found this one to be very enjoyable, funny and well-written."
4,A good example of the work WotC is doing,"With an attempt to convert my 2e's campaign to 3e, I was worried about the translation of key outer realms in my campaign. This book was flexible enough to accomidate ANY campaign's outer planular system. I recomend it.The new Manual of the PLanes is more like the 1e Manual of the Planes than Planescape for me, that's a good thing !"
4,Good to some bad to others,THis is a great great book if you like/have alot of Planer travel in your champain. It does open pretty much everydoor to the multi-universe there is. Execlent descriptions of places we all know and love Nine Hells of Baator and ofcourse the Abyss. And it brings to light some rather unknown places like Limbo and Mechanus. It also brings out alot of new monsters and powerful enemies from all over the inner and out planes. This isnt really one of those have to books UNLESS you are going to do planer travel. Then I must say get this book its a great great thing
2,Utterly disappointed,"For all those AD&D fans who were flying through the planes to get the thrill of adventure, this book has simply been a waste. Why is it so popular ? Planescape used to be better and even the Manual of the Planes offered really SPECIFIC rules to go adventuring on the other planes. So why am I upset ? Because this book offers no specific rules ( I mean serious ones) once you leave your beloved Prime material plane. Plane shifting to the Abyss or Pandemonium is as trifle a matter as teleporting to the nearest petty castle. Your magic, your spells, everything is basically left unhindered (well, nearly). All in all, a book for younglings who simply get fascinated at discovering there are brand new planes with sometimes, uh, spooky monsters. For the others, well, a good artwork (hence it doesn't get the insulting one star)."
4,Old but good!,If your in to the 2nd edition Planescape setting but don't want to abandon some of the 1st edition rules (or want a differant approach to some of them) then this is a must have. It has lot's of good information not present in the 2nd edition material. Also if your in to the Outer Planes setting in AD&D I would also recomend the 1st edition Fiend Folio and Fiend Folio 2 for some original AD&D monsters and demons.
5,The other worlds open before your eyes.,This is an amazing book. No more stumbling around with guesing which planes have what attributes. The manuel of the planes give detailed descriptions of the outer and inner planes and the deitys and demons that live there. This is the book for any plane walking adventurer.
5,new monsters of the planes,"there are three very interesting monsters in this book they are called inevitables, they are mechanical beings from the plane mechanus. i thought hey these would make great character races.so i built one that was a planar champion ""1 of the prestige classes in the book"" and it turned out great so i put him in one of my campaigns that was a cosmology that i created from the bookand it was so cool. i made it so that he helped them get to one of the planes in my cosmology (celestia) and took them to the second level of the mountain where the king of dragons lives (bahamut) a platinum dragon with tons of power that sent them all on a quest which led them into a slightly modified verrsion of speaker in dreams (an excelent adventure for 5th level characters. but any way this is the best non core book out there for your own devious universe creation i reccomend it to any dm that desires his own cosmology."
2,Why?,"I've never understood DnD's reasoning (in any of its incarnations) for building the particular planar structure that it uses for all is worlds. if the Greeks and Babylonian and all those old civilizations made up their own cosmos, why did the creators of DnD think their world's needed to rip off those wonderful inventions instead of making up their own. Now, I realize they have tried from time to time, but no self-respecting DM will use all the junk in this book.The only useful part of this book is the planar characteristics. They should have spent 90% of the book on that, and 10% on examples. Then they would have gotten a 5 star vote from me."
2,Not so hot,"Possibly useful for beginning DMs with a lot of time on their hands, a hankering to futz with the inner workings of the universe (that most players will never see, and even fewer will appreciate), and the lack of creativity to do it his/herself."
1,Dissappointing and overpriced,"I love Kiehls clear lip balms so I expected this to be a great product. The color is fine, but it goes on thick and clumpy and then easily comes off. I used it a couple of times but found that it was more trouble then it was worth. I should have saved my $ for a tube of the excellent clear lip balm from Kiehls. Oh well."
5,Perfect for fans of suspense movies,Both of these movies had me on the edge of my seat. Knowing that their based on true stories adds a whole other level to the movies. This set definitely gets my recommendation.
5,Much Too Short,"This is a great travel video but is much too short. Besides the Changing of the Guard at the Palace, the most interesting part of the video is the Tram Tour. I am not a gardener, so the long segment at the end about the vegetation was very boring."
1,Feminist Revisionism.,"This has to have the worst feminist bias of any history book I have ever read. It would lead me to believe that childbirth wasn't the primary role of women in the 18th Century. There are snide hints that women worked while men got drunk and often the author distorts what primary sources have said. For example it says that women starved themselves so their husbands and kids could eat, when what their source (Which they provide in the book.)says that men and especially women starved themselves so their children could eat. This has nothing to do with having anything against feminism. Any type of revisionism viewed through the prism of a philosophy be it feminism, marxism, Catholicism, existentialism, ect. is poor historical scholarship."
2,"You can't tell, but there's a picture of a rooster on this bag...",The clear/colored picture of a rooster on this handbag...which you can't tell from the picture. Kinda weird.
2,Not as advertised,"The main thing here is that the bag shipped with out the strap. I boughtit for my wife to carry ""all that stuff"" to work. With out the strap it does not work. I requested another one, got it, no strap. On the plus side is the bag looked and felt as pictured and the packing was, if any thing, over done.Greg"
2,"Comfortable, but only lasted 5 days!","I ordered these shoes for my recent trip to Italy. I found them to be very comfortable, but after about 5 days one of the top straps started to frey and come apart. I expected better quality for the price paid."
1,Don't buy these!!!,"I have these shoes in black and purchased them from the Easy Spirit store. The twine in the middle of the shoe that holds the strap together tore on both shoes. The sales lady in the store had the same pair on and I noticed hers had torn as well. I went ahead and bought them anyway thinking this would not happen to mine.... and of course it did!! Needless to say, I only paid $19.95 in the store for them. Don't waste your time like I did!!!"
1,I Would Rather Eat The Soap,"I don't usually bash books, but this one really deserves it.This book is a hack job on old trade articles from the 1920s on the subject of Soap Making from what I believe the publisher claimed to be trade journals. The publisher has done nothing to edit or update. They literally just strung the articles together. It is about as pleasurable as eating a bar of soap. I think eating the soap may actually be more enjoyable."
3,"TOO wide, TOO flat and DID NOT arrive for 3 weeks","I bought this for my son's birthday. It did not arrive for his birthday-even tho I ordered it two weeks before his b-day. The board itself looked ""cheap""--the deck was EXTREMELY FLAT and WIDER than the ""better"" brands(plan B, Fallen etc). I was disappointed, but more important-my son doesn't even use the skateboard. I wanted to send it back--but, I'd have to PAY to return it and then its takes a while to get your money back. I guess his little sister can use it to just GOOF OFF!!! NOT PLEASED or HAPPY about this at all!!"
5,Excellent,"A very good video for the beginning dancer. Has three routines with various difficulty. The pace, explanation, and instruction are all of high quality. I would suggest this video to anyone who wants to begin to learn the style of hip-hop dancing."
1,Not worth the money,"I thought this would be gret for exercising but it's not. This is not easy for beginners and its not fun at all. Its complicated and its not set up in rountines so that you can participate in any part. The music isn't that good and the 3 dancers are not good. All of this was recorded in one day and the teacher doesn't really teach you the steps. I wouldn't buy this, its just a waist of money."
3,OK,"this video is pretty good, I like the combination that is used, but the break down and angles could be better"
2,Not a good workout,"This video was pretty difficult and not a good workout video. I purchased it to change up from Tae Bo, but the moves were too difficult and I got frustrated before I broke a sweat."
2,so so,"The moves are good, but presentation as an actual intructional video leaves a whole lot to be desired. I wish some of these dance professionals (?) would review other dvds (like Madonna Grimes and Jennifer Gilardi) to geet an idea what it takes to teach a move to someone watching a dvd. If you can't learm from Grimes or Gilardi, you probably shouldn't bother."
3,Not sure if this was right for me.,"Maybe hip hop has passed me by, but I found the steps hard to master. I have been trained in dance (long time ago) and can usually follow whatever teachers teach, but hip hop moves use the body in such different ways than I'm used to. I think I'm just not cut out for it, despite really wanting to learn it."
2,Way too fast,I have done the Karen Gayle hip hop video and it is way better. She goes over and over the steps. These are by the same company so I am disappointed they allowed her to do this
3,Not the metal framed filter...,"Jet says this filter is washable...guess you could, but the frame is cardboard. This is the standard filter that comes with the machine. They also sell a metal framed version which is washable, matter of fact, after blowing it out you can put it in the dishwasher...does a nice job. You can also buy furnace filters at the home center for a lot less money. I buy em in a 2 pack for a LOT less than the jet filter. They are not an exact fit, but you can cram em in. I have the washable filter, but I use the disposible ones when doing a major cleanup of the shop. Blow out all the nooks and cranny's with the air chuck and the dust collector running on high. When I finish I just throw away the disposibles and reinstall the metal framed one. The jet filters do a good job, but they are spendy. The price is why I gave em a 3 star rating."
2,Very Poor Fit in the AFS 1000B,"Not impressed with this purchase. The aluminum frame leaves 1/4"" gap around the outside of the filter, and it rattles when clamped in place. I am adding weatherstripping to keep dust from bypassing this filter and clogging the high efficiency secondary filter. The AFS-1000 works very well with the (slightly costly) disposable filters. This washable version no longer appears to be a wise move."
5,Jet filter is superb,"The Jet AFS-1000B is currently the primary dust collector in my new 840 sq ft shop. In the past few months I went through 3 standard filters, often cleaning them on a daily basis. Even with this, the filtration wasn't great. Since receiving the electrostatic filter, the filtration is super and the maintenance has dropped considerably. The filter arrived in great shape and installed without any problems. The metal frame and bracing keeps it rigid for handling and cleaning. I've washed once, at the end of the day, and it was ready to install the next morning. It is definitely a serious improvement over the standard filter and definitely worth the price!!!!!!"
4,Works for me (On an AFS-500)...,"Has a metal frame with cross bars, etc. so I don't doubt it's washable. I just vaccuum mine though. My only gripe is that it isn't QUITE a snug fit. There's a 1/8th inch gap on each side which lets some stuff go straight past the filter (Probably because I have an AFS-500, but Amazon recommended this filter for it). But overall, I'm happy with it."
4,Filter came without a box or instructions,"I just received the filter, and it does not have any instructions or packaging. I is as described, but the fact that there is not additional information, makes me wonder."
4,Heed his craft and art,"Creating sparse settings for the poems of Dylan Thomas and others, Robin Williamson has fashioned a quiet, respectful, and meditative CD. Williamson's voice does not soar. Rather, it connects you to the earth; a solid low timber emanates and gives a good solid base for the poems selected. The music doesn't interfere with the words; it accompanies them in a cooperative manner, making the music work for the poetry unobtrusively. The fact that Williamson put his heart into this work can be easily heard. The only difficulty with this CD is the unbalanced nature of the compositions chosen; Thomas's work dominates, and the other pieces chosen from Welsh traditionals and Mr. Williamson's own work don't quite have the same beauty, although Williamson's ""For Mr. Thomas"" is a worthy effort."
4,summer cool,This is cut to be snug fitting so I bought a larger than usual size. I like that the neckline stays in place.
5,Good work.,"The cover of the book is also wonderful.The contents of the book is useful for me to identify barbie fashions from 1963 to 1969.Thanks to Francois Theimer,the author for giving us a most valuable book on our lovable barbie."
3,Not Her Best,"Nikolayeva was a towering musician. She gloried in the burnished tone and noble, long lines that the Russians came to appreciate so much in Cliburn's playing, and that were exemplified by Gilels. Don't fail to hear her Bach, her Tchaikovsky 1st with Masur and, of course, her Shostakovich.But Nikolayeva's Beethoven is best preserved in the Olympia series, which was recorded live and in her prime. Unfortunately these studio recordings -- her last -- while ruminative and touching for admirers, show a marked falling off in vitality."
1,Don't waste your time,"I was forced to read this spinning slop on writing as a creative writing major. If Baxter would put it to you straight without all of the over-writing it might have been a decent book. Everyone in class was so busy trying to understand what he was trying to convey, we lost the message completely. For a more solid book on writing fiction try Writing Fiction by Janet Burroway or One Writer's Beginnings by Eudora Welty."
1,Get the real ABBA,This one ended up in the 'won't listen to again' bin real quickly. Get the real ABBA.
5,Excellent guitar instruction for self-study,"I had difficulty finding guitar instructors in my area for the first 18 months of owning a guitar, so I turned to Bert Casey's 2 volume series: Acoustic Guitar Primer, and Acoustic Guitar Part 2. These are extremely well done and easy to follow, and each lesson builds nicely on the previous ones, so that by the end of Book 1 you know several chords and techniques such as hammer-ons, pull-offs, slides, and particularly country bass runs The only drawback is that most of the material in book 1 is traditional or folk songs, which doesn't necessarily hold my interest as well as rock or blues, but this is a relatively minor criticism. I found the DVD somewhat helpful, but a bit distracting. Listening to the CDs included with the books helps focus one more on the feel of the strings and the sounds, instead of encouraging one to look at what the left hand is doing."
2,Very Basic,"This book was not a whole lot of help. Very basic, very dated, and no video. There are better beginner lessons out there."
3,Broken CD,The book is fine but I paid about a dollar more for a gauruntee of a disc when it arrived broken in half anyway.
5,Everyone must read this,This is important information for all of us for our own health and our parents. Read and pass along.
1,I must be the only one...,"whose heartburn was made worse by taking more acid. I suspect that much heartburn is caused by stress, which produces TOO MUCH stomach acid. It's always suspicious when EVERY review is 5 stars."
5,lifesaver,"Probably literally a lifesaver. This book allows you to understand and manage your acid reflux without the dangerous and expensive drugs. Once I realized what was going on, I was able to adjust my diet and lifestyle so that I could actually sleep at night again.And it's all finally coming to light for the masses. Just search for the recent news on antacid / heartburn drugs and their risks. I know at least 2 people in their 30's who were on antacids and now have very serious stomach problems. Educate yourselves with this book so you don't end up like them!"
5,Excellent read,This book was recommended by my Internist as a must read. He was so right as this book was all about my problems and answered all my questions. The research was a plus as I always check my facts. I in the future I too will recommend this book.
2,Insubstantial and obscure,"I'd avoid this book. It explains the material poorly and seems largely obsessed with its own notation. If you want to learn about constraint processing, the best books I've seen are Dechter's introduction and the handbook edited by Rossi et. al. Those two will take you all the way to the research literature."
2,A hard read....,"I suppose this book is a good beginner's guide if you can follow the reading. I found it to be a very taxing read. I found myself reading sentences several times and slowing down tremendously to try to understand what exactly was meant by each sentence. The sentence structure, the run on sentences, and the way the book is organized, makes it hard for someone like myself to follow the actual point of it all. The book pulls you in too many directions all at once, which often leads to the reader finding themselves lost in the sauce. The price is great, but that might be due to the fact that no one wants a book they can't understand:)"
1,They Sell Broken Crystal Horse!,It is apparent that they intentionally sell Broken Crystal Horse. Shame on Amazon on carrying this item and not investigate the problem customer reported. The horse broke off the base. They way it wraps it made me believe the supplier knew it was broke and still put them in the box and let Amazon sells it.
1,Not what was expected,I ordered this as a birthday present... and it arrived BROKE. I would not recommend this seller to ANYONE.
1,Look for another solution,Tried this in my tiled tub shower area - didn't work at all. Used finger instead.
5,"Wow, Best Cake Decorating Book","ISBN 0-385-18376-3172 pages (8/12 x 11)Copyright 1983 by Farm Journal, Inc.This book is two cookbooks in one. It gives you more than 200 recipes for cakes and frostings. It also is a decorating book with 100 easy ideas shown step-by-step on how to decorate a cake. The sections in the book are as follows: 1.

3,This is a very sweet movie,"If you are a true Peter Deluise fan you will love this movie...this movie has no bad language, sex, or violence. That is what makes this a good movie.. This is truely a family film full of southern charm. I enjoyed the movie very much. The scenery and location where this film was made is just beautiful..this is a rare and special movie. I think Peter Deluise did an excellent job staring in this movie and directing it."
1,An hour or more of your life will be gone forever!,"This movie is so horrible! Its so horrible I recommend seeing it w/ friends or at a party and creating your on Mystery Science Theatre 3000 movie!!! The only and I mean only good thing about this movie is that Mentone,AL is a real place and is very beautiful so there are many good shots in the movie of this town. My theory is obviously these two ladies could not find jobs due to may I say, lack of talent. So they begged for money and made a movie they could be the stars in. This is suppose to be a Christian movie but they must have forgotten one of the Seven deadly sins....vanity! Don't quite your day job!!!!"
2,Not enough room for socket.,I purchased these for a small block Chevy with the one piece rear main seal. There wasn't enough room to get a socket or wrench between the head of the bolt and the flange on the crankshaft. Ended up not using them and going with GM bolts.
5,Great Idea Source for the Beginner,"I found this book quite helpful in designing and building my first pond. While I can consider very few books perfect representations of their topics this book helped me make intelligent decisions. Regardless of what book you pick on the subject you will find that there is a lot to learn in pondkeeping that is simply not addressed adequately in books, but rather by ""trial and error"". Regarding this book, I found the section on fish is not very detailed, so those interested in koi keeping will benefit from a book such asThe Essential Book of Koi: A Complete Guide to Keeping and Care,which is quite good."
4,"Nautica Men's 1 1/2"" Monterey Leather Belt, Brown",Pleased with the quality of the leather and the appearance of the belt though it did take a while to receive the item.
4,good product but terrible exchanges,"Product is fine but since this was purchased from Shoebuy from Amazon I could not exchange for a correct size. I had to return to Amazon and reorder. I guess that is par for all the ""third party"" vendors at Amazon."
4,And even better...,"Hey, KARTA is good, but what is even better is the new CD ""Close to You"" - and ""Solo I"". Both only available from the German Amazon Web site. But I've been told that this will change in future...""Close to You"" is incredibly good. Spiritual music of a power and presence like I've never heard before:http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NWFT/"
4,"It's good, but there are better books","The good thing about this book is that it talks about many of the scenic sites and other things that you can do for free. It's also good about telling you about historic societies and museums where you can find history of the culture. But most of the sites they mention are listed in the the other books that I have (Maui Revealed and The Big Island Revealed). These two books cover much more information, and cover the same information as this book, but in more detail. For instanace, this book will tell you that there's a legend associated with a certain place, and make a small mention of it, but the Revealed books explain it more. I didn't find anything in here that I didn't see in my other books. It's a good book, but unfortunately someone out-did it."
5,Classic Masterpiece,"Everyone who loves music, love Ceschi because he does it all. It doesn't matter what you're into or who you are, This album and this artiest has something you'll love. Might as well buy all his albums at once cause once you hear one, you'll have to get the others anyway. Check out all his side projects too."
2,Didn't do much for me,I love this brand but wasn't overly impressed with this cleanser. Dried out my skin and didn't clear it up.
4,works good,I've tried almost everything to help clear my acne and this product finally seems to be making a difference :))
5,Good SystemC Introduction,"This is a good SystemC introduction. The examples are clear and concepts are explained well. My only complaint (other than a syntax error in the ""HelloWorld"" example) is that I would really like to see a section on SystemC's macro system in general, since a truly conscientions C++ programmer will be using the SystemC library without the macros. But, I haven't seen any book address this topic. So, my review is otherwise all positive."
2,"Poorly edited, bad layout","I have read through this book cover to cover twice in an attempt to tease out gems of insight. The information is there, but the extremely compact writing style and poor layout make the endeavor difficult. In addition, the examples are very superficial. When I've got a question about SystemC I consult the LRM (IEEE 1666) and I rarely go back to this book."
1,Unacceptable,"If you charge >$100 for a book this small and advertise downloadable code examples, and even refer to them in the book. At least have the decency to spend the 1 hour it would take to actually put them online. Other than that, the content is very terse. The only reason I got this book was because of the lack of other material. It would be trivial to write a better book. The author even used a ton of space in the back for basic C++ material. I'm guessing to make sure it broke the 200 page mark. And this book is really small form factor...the website: [...] (embarrassing)"
4,Third party received it!,I am unable to give you feed-back on this product as it was delivered to a third party as a gift. I have never seen it.
3,Not a very good regenerative radio.,"This is definitely a toy, and not a serious attempt at a quality receiver. It isn't even actually a kit in that all wiring, etc. has already been completed. The reception is extremely poor due to a poor design. For instance, the plate load resistor values are more appropriate for a transistor design. Anybody that considers this radio a ""rare collectible"" is delusional. It is no wonder that it has been discontinued.It has been quite awhile since I bought the radio, and I got fifty cents for it at my yard sale. I got exactly what it is worth."
3,Not great performance,"This isnt exactly a 'kit' that you put together. Most of the parts just snap in and you assemble it quickly. The vacuum tube is interesting to look at and its interesting to see the exposed parts. I couldnt pick up any stations at all though, and its a little hard to get set up. After a while I got a bit bored. I wasnt expecting to get great performance, but I hoped to at least get one faint station. It also requires like 8 batteries."
2,Thames Experimental Radio reception bad.,"i'd seen this at a Museum store, so thought we'd give it a try. Kids had fun putting together, but were sadly disappointed in the reception, basically there wasn't much. Wouldn't buy again."
1,Why Read This Drivel?,"This was about the most mind numbing foray into an infantile Woman's persuit of purpose. If I ever knew a Person like this character (Kiki), I think she'd be so self absorbed, and bored out of her mind, I would walk, no, RUN from them. What a waste of paper. (I gave it one star because 0 wasn't available)."
4,A Good Primer on Viking History with a great index!,"This is a very well-rounded book, giving insights into many facets of Viking life and history. It is well-written and very well organized. The index is a valuable resource for other materials relating to those subjects you would like to read more in depth. I highly recommend it!"
3,Half 'n Half,"There's some really good stuff here, including Saldip Jabble's gorgeous ""Janj Mahi Ley Aya."" I could have done without some of the more western influenced, more baltently disco tunes, particlularly Bombay Talkie's ""Chargiye,"" but this is still a fine overview of Bhangra."
5,Powerful!,"The dohl and other percussive instruments, along with unique vocals and catchy rhythms can push this Punjab-based music onto any dance floor and blow listeners minds and get their feet moving, their arms waving. Although I have my favorites, including Sangeeta's Hindi performance on Track 4, I love to leave the entire album going non-stop. Though its power can move your body, its musicality is soothing. After a busy workday, I love to pop it in the player on the way home to unwind. It can definitely take you out of the traffic and into another world."
2,My cat much prefers real feathers,"This is probably much more durable than the feather attachment, and if your cat goes for it, the rating goes to five. Mine didn't."
3,the refil is ok,i have bot othere da bird products and those were well made - lasted thru abuse and the toy spun around as it traveled thru the air.this toy does not spin and therefore does not get the cat's attention as much as the feather toy that spins
3,Just OK.,"We keep a tin of various attachments for da bird and this one is ok, but not as popular and the fur fun or original attachments. My cat's favorites are (in order of most to least favorite):1 Da Bird Fur Fun2 Da Bird Original3 Da Bird Sparkly attachment4 Da Bird Kitty Puff"
1,Cat ate it parts of it,I wish the mylar or whatever material was stronger. My cat just in playing with it for a few minutes and chewing on it for a second was able to chew a couple pieces off and eat them.I bought a couple of them but am not going to use them since I'm pretty sure having a cat eat the sparkler material isn't good for the cat.
3,Cat prefers the feathers that came attached to the wand.,"I'd bought the Da Bird Superpack that contains 1 of the sparkly attachments, plus I ordered an extra one because I thought it was sparkly feathers - not plastic streamers.The cat loves the feather attachment that came attached to the Da Bird wand and will stalk, watch, and chase it around until I'm tired :-), but not this sparkly attachment. She'll follow it around, and occasionally reach for it and catch it, but she is not very interested otherwise, and won't chase it. I regret having bought an extra of this, and will stick with the feathers. If I had a small child I'd just attach these sparkly attachments to the bicycle handles so they won't be wasted. :-)"
2,Cat loves it but falls apart easily,"My cat goes nuts over this toy; unfortunately, it only lasts a couple of days at best. This is the second one I've bought because I was hoping the first one was just defective, but the second one fell apart even faster. It's really frustrating because this is by far my cat's favorite toy, but the sparkly pieces are easily pulled out of the red cap. I keep trying to find ways to fix it, but so far I've been unsuccessful. I'm going to keep trying though, because he never seems to get tired of playing with it. I really hope the Da Bird people will find a way to make this more durable. I've never run into this problem with the feathers, so there has to be something that can be done to improve this attachment. I'd buy 10 of them if I knew they would remain intact for longer than a week!"
1,DON'T ORDER - YOU WILL GET FEATHERS INSTEAD,"The item, the sparkly attachment, is wonderful, the problem is that their warehouse has attached a barcode that says it is the Sparkly attachment to the Feather attachment.I have reordered it twice, with the same results. Of course Customer Service is apologetic and sends Return Auths, and then ships out the same thing. Three strikes and you are out as I recall. I will go to Petsmart and buy the refill pack which includes all the other attachments that Annie the cat has no interest in. While the expense is little, it is the principle that ticks me off."
2,"a bit pricey and not all that ""worth it""","Looking back, I have no idea what possessed me to buy this for such a HIGH price!...I treated that stuff like it was gold. However, it did help a little with moisture and a lot with strengthening. There are other products out there that can do better in either department for a lot less money...so save yourself some change and look elsewhere."
5,Fully Loaded 2000-Best PPV of the year,"Fully Loaded is defiinately the best PPV I have seen all year. All of teh WWF's big stars were there, such as Undertaker, HHH, The Rock, Chris Jericho and more. The matches were all of high quality and very entertaining. The bloody Last man standing match between Jericho and HHH was one of the best matches this year. The Benoit vs. The Rock Title match was full of entertaining moves blood. The cage match between Rikishi and Val Venis for the Intercontinental Title involved one of the most awesome things I've seen for a long time, as Eikishi climbed to the top of the cage and splashed Venis who was 15 feet below in the ring. This ppv included many more exciting matches also, like Kurt Angle vs Undertaker and Tazz vs. Al Snow. I am definately going to buy this video on September 19."
5,The best Fully Loaded ever.,"I was there live and it was great. The only disappointment was only one title changed hands and that was Perry Saturn defeating Eddie Guerro for the European title. The best match was Rikishi vs. Val Venis in a steel cage for the Intercontinental title when Rikishi did the Jimmy Snuka off the top of the cage and onto Val Venis's ribs. I loved watching The Hardy Boyz w/Lita beating T&A w/Trish, especially when Lita kicked Trish's ass. As usually Edge and Christian kept the belts after getting themselves disqualified after using the belts on the Acolytes. I was pretty sure Tazz was going to choke out Al Snow. Lot of blood in the Last man standing match when Triple H beat Chris Jericho by one second. The Undertaker vs. Kurt Angle was the funniest because Angle just didn't stand a chance bsides he was still too paranoid. I was proud of Mick Folly when heordered the main event to continue after Benoit thought he won the belt from the Rock, but the Rock won in the end."
3,Almost perfect LMS,"Chris Jericho vs Triple H Last Man Standing MatchGreat match but if HHH would have put Chris Jericho over, it would have been better. The match has bit of everything to make it a near perfect last man standing match. The wrestling was there, the drama along with the storytelling was there, and Stephanie was there as always to interfence in the match. If it wasn't for Stephanie's in ring interfence and HHH refusal to job to Chris Jericho, this match would have been absolutely near perfect. 9.5/10"
4,"Fully Loaded, VERY GOOD PPV","I Heard that some people thought this PPV was bad, well I personally loved it...the HHH vs Jericho Last Man Standing was absolutly amazing. Kurt Angle being given the Last Ride was amazing as the impact totally crushed the living bejesus out of him. The Rock vs Benoit was also an amazing match as Benoit came inches away several times to winning the title...other then the triple main event, nothing TOO great happened here...but its still worth it..."
1,Pop-psych pep-talks for postmoderns -- Go girl-guru!,"Monastic wisdom? Not exactly. More like pop-psych pep-talks. If that's what you're looking for, this is the book for you. Go girl-guru."
3,very Canadian,"OK, I get that Expo 67 was some sort of watershed historical moment in Canadian society. Sadly, I was too young and far too interested in the Apollo space program to care about this. This DVD helps fill in those blanks, but I really wanted more on the pavilions and to see much much more of what Expo 67 was like architecturally. Not that the DVD is bad at all, but it could have been so much better.The extras are pathetic as all we get the original TV broadcast of the opening which other than the camera panning over the site and some info on what was what, it is a total snoozefest watching dignitaries speak."
5,Canadian Experience Expo 67- Back To The Future,"This was a trip down memory lane for me having attended this fair. The video was VERY well done, I usually don't care for memory type interviews but this film made them interesting. This DVD is expensive but if you were there or are really into Worlds Fairs, It's well worth your time and money. It left me wanting to borrow Marty McFly's time traveling Delorean and go back and see it all again."
1,Not what I was looking for...,"Unfortunately this was not the type of brush I was looking for. It's small and would be better suited for a child's or doll's hair. The handle I could hardly get a good grip on due to the size. Finally the brush is not as soft or cushioned as the description says. The brush is inflexible and hard. I customize Blythe dolls as a hobby and I've decided to use them for the dolls, when I customize their hair."
4,"Simple, easy to read","This is a nice, simple, easy to read book on different types of clouds and weather conditions. Fast reference when you need 'em!"
5,Excellent product,"I love this stuff - it's reasonably priced and works better than more expensive products. Unfortunately, I don't think they make it any more. If you can get any, buy it! Face feels soft after just a week's use."
1,petroleum product,"I eagerly awaited receiving this product based on the reviews it received. I used a few nights, and was reminded of older creams my mom used to use back in the day. I decided to check the ingredient list and was dismayed to read that it is a petroleum product. Not the best thing to rub into one's skin ... wish the ingredient list had been listed on the site, as there is no way I would have ordered this."
4,First novel & not the last!,"Good effort by Mr. Kingsley. It's all here. Legal twists, mysterious characters and a generous dose of romance. Kept me reading past my bedtime!"
4,Fabulous First Novel,With Malicious Intent is a zippy legal thriller with some great plot twists. It is very accurate in its depiction of an environmental lawsuit in the bayous of Louisianna. Most of the characters are not necessarily what they seem. Great descriptions bring this area of the country to life. A fun read!
4,"Typical, enjoyable, end of the world as we know it, film.","I just got this movie and I've watched it twice. It is a good movie that I am suprised I haven't seen on the sci-fi channel. I like the story line and the acting was ok. In short the world is in danger. positive charged lightening( apparently more dangerous than regular lightening) will bring on the next ice age. The scientist has an idea, on how to save the world with the help of her family. great film."
1,no closed captioned as listed,I bought this only because it said it was closed captioned and we can't watch movies without words due to hearing problems which resulted in us wasting our money on the movie.
5,Lightning: Bolts of Destruction,I like Disaster movies so I ordered this movie. It came fast and looks to be in great shape. I have not had time to watch the movie yet
1,Space is 650 MB not 700 MB,"I bought the Khypermedia CD-R 50 pack, the cd space was mentioned 700MB but my drive ( khypermedia drive) always complains about its size if the data > 640MB.I tried to call Khpermedia service center but the phone was never picked up. I left 3 voice mails no response after 4 months. Later on I tried to call merchant and complain about its size they said we will take it back if it is not opened and used which is not possible. At last I end up with paying more for less space.Amazon beware of this product."
2,Lots of bad disks using NERO5,"I have gone through 400 of these cd's and I would guess I probably have 25 per box of 200 that are bad at least. The verification after burn gets a lot of bad writes. The cd-rom I use is capable of 52x burn but I have to burn at 34x to even get decent good cd's. If I push it to 48x, I would suspect my failure rate to exceed 20%. The quality of the disks is obviously lacking."
3,The CD's are good price but about 5-10% are bad,I was losing a good 30% of the cd's to bad verification with 52x burns using Nero5. I went down to 32x burns and I still have about a 5-10% bad verification. Sometimes I'll have 3 bad cd's in a row. The price is the only reason to get these. If you want to really burn a lot of cd's its tough to beat but it's also a big time waster as you throw out a good 15-20 cd's in the pack at 32x speed burns.
2,ONLY 32X!!!,"I got these cd-r's to go with my new cd-r drive that can burn at 52x, but was very disappointed when the various burning programs I used with these discs would only burn these discs at 32x! I even tried an up-to-date version of Nero Burning Rom and it would only burn at 32x! I was very disappointed.Other than that, they're fine though, I'm just very disappointed..."
5,Great book!,I taught a class on narrative structure for computer and special effect artists created from thefirst edition and implemented by this later one. I'm very happy to see it still is in print!
1,Waste of Money,"I agree with the previous reviews about the excess shipping charges. What made it worse was that BoxWave shipped my screen protector with two unremovable stickers affixed. The one on the backing sheet, telling you to remove the backing sheet is understandable, but to place another non removable sticker to the protective sheet itself, telling you to remove the backing sheet, is idiotic. Just how are you supposed to use a clear protective sheet that has a non removable label that obscures the screen of the Nuvi?"
2,"Not all that great, way overpriced.","Shows fingerprints too readily, not easy to apply properly. Way, way overpriced. Shipping was over $2, but postage on letter was less than 50 cents."
2,Darkseed,"I was very disappointed that I could not get the game to play-ever. When I tried to contact the manufacturer, they never responded. Totally bad customer service. No-satisfaction at all and have a game that will-not play!"
3,easy to use workbook,"I use this as an adjuvant to my classes, just to get extra practice. Even though it is oriented to Christian students, the Hebrew is sound for my Jewish studies. One good point: the 'font' size of the Hebrew is large enough that you don't need a magnifying glass to read the vowel points! And the answer key is internet based, which is convenient for juggling page and answer key!"
5,wonderfully helpful,"Great tool. Clear, concise, to the point. Arrange in a helpful way, less confusing than other grammars."
4,Basics of Biblical Hebrew Workbook,"I bougth this workbook to supplement another workbook I am using in my study of Biblical Hebrew. It is a good workbook, laid out in an orderly fasion to master the ancien Biblical language. I especially love the extra information it gives in the ""Table of Insights""."
5,59 year old beginner,This grammer is very good and was recommended by a good friend who studied under Pratico.
5,Great resource for the medical professional!,This book is a great resource for transcribers and other medical professionals. We use it at our worksite everyday. We especially like the format of black and colored type. It is done in a very user friendly format.
3,"18"" bubble wall","These reviewers are not very bright. The Bubble Wall is the best of 4 different types I bought. The bubbles are fine and the whole 18"" (two joined parts) bubble uniformly.To avoid large bubbles one must place the suction cups on the end fittings (NOT on the actual bubble material. And joining the two pieces is easy if one takes a nail file and gently bevels the end.I installed four of these with NONE of the issues other complainers wrote about."
2,Uneven bubbles,"The diffuser comes as two pieces that are joined together. When I installed it, one side had plenty of bubbles, but the other side seemed to not work at all. I tried using a needle to punch holes in the non-bubbling side as suggested in the instructions, but then that side produced large bubbles and the other side seemed to produce almost no bubbles. I was using a more than adequate air pump with variable output, so it wasn't the pump causing problems.It seems the pores in the two pieces weren't matched in size, so you get uneven output."
4,Holes using a needle!!!,"I was dissapointed because i had to make holes with a needle all over the tube and i thought it was made of hard stone rock material ""It's really a hard board material"""
1,Stopped working after a couple months!!,"This was great for a few days, but soon the bubbles dwindled down to nothing. I am really disappointed with this product and I will be buying from someone else next time."
1,product sucks,"I wouldn't reccommend this at all to anyone. it does not work, you have to make the holes, the fish tear it apart, just an overall bad product."
4,nice,works well does the job prob one of the better brands out there would buy again if i need to id recomend this
1,useless piece of cardboard,"bought the 28"" diffuser, its actually two 14"" attached with a sleeve. Put it on my aquarium and the bubbles were inconsistent one of the half barely produced any bubbles. I used a needle and poked a few holes in it, the bubbles where huge just by using a needle, the thing is ruined. Useless."
1,duckpin,"what a piece of junk.bad flow of air..only comes out of one tube,mostly around inlet..pass on this item and buy another"
5,Diffrent Stroeks for Diffrent Folks!,"This Is One of The Best Shows Ever.I Always Like to watch it,Cus It's Funny.It Brought to my Attanchion that is a seriuos Show,But Funny One!When I Saw it's on DVD i was Excited!The Show Rules. There aren't much special features,but hey, It's Not for The Features, it's for the Episodes, Right?Buy It Now!Arnold Rules all Things and Stuff!"
5,it's real good!!!!,If you loved diff'rent Strokes and you don't own a copy of this series ...trust me ..you don't know what your missing...it is a treasure to have. When i first got the dvds i woke up in the mornings watching it ... i watched it when i got off from work and i even went to bed watching it. thats how good it is. i already ordered my second season after seeing the first and i cant wait for it to arrive!!!
4,Great Product But...,This Product is great. Only issue is that it isn't Vista Compatible out of the box it takes some major digging on Microsoft's site to get the fingerprint reader to work
2,undependable,Sometimes my fingerprint opens the computer and at other times it doesn't work at all. Overall it is very undependable. William Ray
1,Needs to be redone to log onto domain,"Does not let you logon to domain with your fingerprint. Thus is just a toy for home use.Wait until they make a version that lets you log onto your domain with your fingerprint (oddly they act like somehow a ""password"" is more secure than your fingerprint, which as you know can't be copied or stolen). Product will be worthwhile once you can log onto domain. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money.Mike Crowe"
1,Not really wireless keyboard,"Altough the pictures of the keyboard clearly show it without any wires coming from it, when it arrived it had a USB cable attached to it, the very thing a person wants to avoid if they are going for a wireless product. The seller refunded the cost of the unit but kept the S&H fee (a source of profit from the much lower actual cost to them) and would not pay for the return postage. They said we should have scrolled down to the bottom page of the web site to read the small print -- ""USB wire attached"". Beware of dealings with this marketer."
2,typical microsoft,I just can't give this product a good review. The fingerprint reader won't work with Firefox. I was extremely dissappointed by this and I returned it.
4,caution,JUST SO EVERY1 KNOWS THIS IS NOT A WIRELESS SET AS DESCRIPTION SAYS !!!just the mouse is wireless not the keyboard im not big on giving reviews but figured evey1 should know this
2,"crap, fingerprint reader crap","Only positive thing about this key board was how comfortable it is. Other than that this thing sucks! Most frustrating thing is that there are no drivers for this with a 64bit computer! Not for vista or 7 anyways. There was a forum like 3 years old saying they were working on one but I couldn't find one. So nothing cool works on the keyboard like the fingerprint scanner. Not wireless, and mine didn't come with a mouse either. When this thing got to me it looked like it was thrown against a wall and then somebody spilt soda all over it. The keys stuck and had deep scratches all over it. This thing is more of a toy then a tool do not buy for fingerprint reader! Buy a separate one and some good software not Microsoft crappy stuff."
3,Nice but has compatibility issue with Dell laptops,"After installing the lap top software to enable the shortcut keys, my laptop exhibited some bad behavior. If I remove it from the docking station and carry it to a conference room to plug into a projector, when I hit Func-F8 to switch the display mode, the screen blinks and flashes, and maximizes the magnification such that I cannot even display powerpoint. This may be my company's firewall and other security stuff, but removing the keyboard software fixed it.Also the fingerprint reader response is very, very slow. 20sec or so between putting my finger on the spot and getting the logged in screen."
4,Corvette Shirt,"My husband loved this shirt that I bought for his birthday! The colors are great, and the material is comfortable! He'll be wearing it at the car shows coming up in the spring!"
4,At last! This performance is on DVD!,"This is a great performance of Nanci at her finest. The sound has been cleaned up remarkably from the VHS edition (especially good is the DTS), but unfortunately the picture has not (that's why only four stars). MCA obviously put very little money into the project in the first place because it looks as if it were recorded on someone's home video camera -- it does look better than it did but there was just so much they could do. One thing has always puzzled me about this, however; for some reason the performance of ""Wing and the Wheel"" that is one the CD edition of this concert has been left out of both the VHS and DVD editions. The addition of the videos is a very welcome bonus. I had never seen most of them as no music channel has the good sense to play Nanci Griffith."
4,Classis Nanci,"I love this concert! This is a younger, more conventional, less political Nanci. The 1988 concert will take you back a few years.The sound is the same as the CD, but the video looks like a grainy home movie. To me, this doesn't detract from the intimacy of the concert setting or my enjoyment of her performance any more than if it was a home movie.So if you want cinematic perfection, look elsewhere. If you like Nanci and want to experience a fantastic concert, this is it."
3,"Great music, but left out content","I was interested in this DVD for the fabulous Roseville Fair, which, sadly, along with The Wing and the Wheel (another of Ms. Griffith's great ones!), is not included. Great music, and the bonus videos would be nice, if only the DVD had included songs from the actual performance listeners hear on the CD! I was willing to forgive the poor video quality other reviewers noted given the venue, but passed when I realized I wouldn't experience Ms. Griffith's performance of the song for which I was buying the DVD."
2,Not worth watching,"The songs are excellent, but the video quality is brutal to watch.I consider it a DVD audio.The videos included with the performance are a nice addition."
3,Great Music but HORRIBLE video quality.,"I know this was not a major production when it was originally filmed, but I have to say that this is probably the worst looking DVD I have ever seen. Surely with the technology available today there could be a better master of this fantastic performance. The audio is great, which of course is the main reason for getting it. Nanci Griffith is one of my favorite singer/song writers, and I would still suggest this DVD even with the lackluster video quality."
3,Nanci Griffith_One Fair Summer Evening +,"Given all the hype, I was not that impressed. Mediocre recording quality and 57 minutes doesn't cut it with me. I'll take Patti Griffith anytime"
4,A Good Base,"This book will give you an overview of the Churches history on children and families. While the book presents many ideas that are antiquated and opposite of today's theologies on the the teaching of children, this book can be used as a tool to see where many bases for church's thoughts on children came from.An important history lesson for anyone working with children!"
2,Lacking,I personally didn't like this CD. Isn't wasn't very user friendly. Also the number of new vocabulary words are very limited.
3,original but not so great conditiion,"product condition wasnt the best, definetly should not have been put in new products . but it was cheap and also original. so that can be said."
4,Collection of essays,"The advantage of this piece is that Richey, Rowe, and Miller Schmidt put into one volume thirty-two essays, some of which are hard to find. Eight the essays were first published in Richey's 1985 edited volume, Rethinking Methodist History; six of the essays came from the journal Methodist History. Essays are grouped chronologically into three periods- the founding period, nineteenth century, twentieth century- and one topical group: reforms. There are no surprises and nothing new."
3,318 Love:,"I know the producers and a couple of the artists on this album. It's actually a nice album, but it's lacking originality. Artists coming from Bastrop & Monroe Louisiana (318) you wouldn't expect this entire CD to be dominately Texas influenced."
1,Soggy Pie,"Although apparently every PR flack will take his call, the Muses won't anymore. Good lord, all you Kool-Aid drinkers: we can listen to the samples here and tell how much this one stinks!!Also, as a free clue as to whether to believe a McCartney album review here, look for the word ""Macca."" Macca = written by a hack-a. If not straight from the record company, then the reviewer is badly addled by BM. (Beatlemania) Let's lick BM, and all avoid this further road apple produced by one of the greats."
1,"You can do much better than this, Sir!","When I heard the first notes for ""Fine Line"", I thought: No Sir Paul, it's like the completely disposable ""Press to Play"" again!Paul McCartney is an EXCELLENT composer and performer. Hey, if he was quite good working with John Lennon in the Beatles era, a real Rock phenomenon with the 'classic' Wings grouping (Linda, McCullough, Laine), and even an extraordinary soloist (Flowers in the Dirt, Flaming Pie) I cannot understand how he could fall to make such a piece of crappy record like ""Chaos and Creation.."".This is not you, Mr. McCartney! Nigel Godrich can work as a good producer for 'modern' bands, but it is not your case! This album is a real ""Chaos"" of the worst class!"
2,"very,very average","Paul Mccartney needs to hang it up.all of these years crying about Michael Jackson&arguably trying to make Michael Jackson type records for the past 20 plus years(sorry Paul you ain't Michael Jackson)&they have been Soggy attempts.Paul Mccartney goes back to doing a One Man Show playing all the Instruments on a few tracks which is a welcome return.Mccartney is a Great Bass player,good Guitar Player&Keyboard Player.but Words&Music is His game.on this set aside from a few tracks,this is pretty run of the mill.Paul Ain't moved me since 'Say,Say,Say""&there ain't nothing here gonna change my opnion of that."
1,I want to like the album.....really!,"I'm sure once I figure out how to get the songs on my ipod I'll start enjoying the music, but at this point, I feel like trashing the CD!I can't believe that EMI would choose a content protection format that is not fully compatible with ipods. I didn't even notice the teeny print on the CD cover saying that it may not be compatible with ipods until after I was unable to load the songs into itunes.What recourse do I have? I doubt that I can return the CD. In the future, I'll be very careful when purchasing CDs and will only buy them if they are either returnable or compatible with how I want to listen to the music.Funny how in the paper today there is an article about the sad state of the music business: ie, not enough CDs are being sold. As a person who currently does buy CDs, an experience such as this is only going to make me reconsider where I spend my money."
4,One of his best,"I read the online reviews and like many was a little untrusting of the rave reviews, however I must say this is one of his best solo albums and nobody paid me anything to say that!Unlike many, I discovered Paul McCartney before the Beatles and have every album he's recorded. I would rank this one up with ""Flaming Pie"" and almost hitting the heights of ""Flowers in the Dirt"" which remains my favourite. If you don't own it you're missing out!Some gems on this album are ""fine line"", ""follow me"", ""too much rain"", ""friends to go"" all of which are very catchy. Some fun songs such as ""English tea"" bring some diversity to the album.As for comments about which Beatle was the true talent - give it a rest. Paul, George and John were/are phenomenal song writers, legends of our time."
2,I Should Have Known Better......,"All the critical applause of this new McCartney CD had me foaming at the mouth waiting for my copy to come from Amazon. And as I write this review, I see that this is the #1 selling CD on Amazon currently. So, is it me or is it them? ""Chaos and Creation in the Backyard"" is bland and without inspiration. I guess I could blame the producer but I can't imagine this material being very interesting, regardless of who helped Paul put it together. I've only given it 2 stars on the hope that it might grow on me over time but that seems unlikely. Sir Paul McCartney has been and will continue to be a musical hero of mine but I should have known better than to trust the critics this time out. Maybe they all hope to get stage-front tickets from Paul for his new concert tour by pumping-up their acclaim. Save your money for seeing Sir Paul live if you get a chance. He won't disappoint you."
2,Back Off Boogaloo,"While Paul's latest is considerably better than Driving Rain,that's not saying much. I found 9 of the 13 tracks listenable, the other 4 boring. Of the listenables, there is nothing ""Great"" as you would expect at least something great on every album. When the best material is just OK or not bad, to me, that constitutes a sub-par McCartney album.What became of the ""man of a thousand voices""? Paul is down to 1 or 2. Paul needs a reminder of what Ringo wrote (and sang) 35 years ago - ""Get yourself together now and give me something tasty; everything you try to do, you know it sure sounds wasted.""While this album may be Paul and sounds like Paul, Beatle Paul is not present."
2,Supermarket Music,"I love Paul McCartney, and I have been a Beatles and a Wings fan since my early years, but this album is probably only something for hardcore Paul fans. It is dull, boring, self-indulgent, over-produced, at times overly simple, and definitely in my opinion, does not even come close to any Wings album or specifically the ""Flaming Pie"", with all these wonderful ballads. One word: no heart or soul. As a number of folks have already commented as to each individual song, there is no reason to chime in. I regret having spent almost $10 for this album."
1,This Music's Got Absolutely No Feel To It,"Simply put, this is one of the five worst albums/CD's I've ever heard and I've listened to well over five thousand of them. I'm a 40 year Beatles fan and am not at all anti-McCartney. This ""music"" is bland, lifeless and duller than a speech by Dick Cheney. After reading all the glowing pre-release hoopla, I was literally stunned by how weak this music is."
4,Very Pleased,"I enjoyed this collection of songs much more than some of the other recent ones. I felt that the mellow tunes were conducive to McCartney's voice and also to easy listening while not actually becoming ""elevator-type music."" I am pleased that McCartney is still turning out winners and hope to hear much more from him in future."
4,PAUL'S COMEBACK,"At first listen, this album seems like another valiant but awkward attempt at achieving something close to the heights of the melody making machine McCartney has been for most of his career. But like a sleepy bar-room tune that creeps up on you unexpectedly, this collection of orchestrated tunes will be resonating in and out of you for the better part of the year. Paul's best since '79s ""Back To The Egg""; nuff said............"
5,Awesome CD,"This is an awesome CD. The CD is a little differentfrom his typical style of music, but every song isfantastic. There is not one bad song on the CD. Ilisten to it every day. The more I listen to the songs,the more I enjoy them."
5,very good,"Its a little different from a lot of the other stuff he's done, a little more low key and mellow, but at the same time still has his McCartney charm that is evident in every one of the tracks. Most certaintly recomended for fans."
4,very good McCartney,"I totally don't agree that most of Paul McCartneys post Beatles music isn't any good!! I became a McCartney fan because of Wings and his solo music, not because of the Beatles!McCartneys career since the Beatles is filled with quality and a wonderful variety of styles! Sure everything hasn't been earth shattering, but what artist every song has been??As for Chaos, it's a very good album that would of been even better if McCartney had used his band. Even so Chaos contains some definite McCartney classics!!"
1,Brutal,"Did McCartney call Rolling Stone and plead with them not to savage this brutal effort? I'm at a loss at how they could've favorably reviewed this album. In fact, if this had been produced as a demo by a wannabe, it would have never seen the light of day.Here's an idea--compile all of Paul's best post-Beatle work and see if it adds up to one or two good discs. Here's another idea---compile John's, Paul's, and George's best (Ringo DQ'd). Now there's a best seller."
1,Chaos and Creation in the Backyard: Lacks Pop & Fizz,"McCarthney comes from a well known and storied past that makes us all curious about his next release. ""Chaos and Creation in the Backyard"" lacks the color and texture of some of his better work. It does not help that he is the major or at times the sole musician on its songs. Some are promising yet as a collection do not feel fully developed. Disappointing work from an incredibily talented man. I just expected more."
2,Letmedownagain,"I too fell for the five stars that reviewers gave this album. Lets face it, McCartney hasn't made a strong album since ""Flaming Pie"" in 1997. Sure, I'll play the album again although I don't believe there are any songs that will stay in my head. The music is geared for a dentist office. Stick with ""Band on The Run"",""Tug of War"" or ""Flowers In The Dirt."""
2,It's no Tug of War,"To be fair, I never compare solo work by Lennon or McCartney to their work together; it's apples and oranges.So this one sounds a lot like other ones Sir Paul has turned out over the years. Tug of War remains my fave.Can't say I'd buy this one if I were you."
3,Not Up to Snuf,"As a 40-year fan of Mr. McCartney, I was somewhat underwhelmed by this effort.It had some nice cuts, to be sure, and overall, I applaud the effort, but I think Paul should relax, spend his money on some worthwhile charities, and take his time with the next composition. We, as fans, would rather less and have quality, than more - just to fill a album/CD."
3,good but lazy creation in the backyard....,"First of all, mccartney is the greatest songwriter, performer ever. (eg. just review his catalog of great songs).However, this CD is NOT mccartney at his best. (seems like hes too busy to pulish a song or to improve lyrics)If you want top-of-the-line CD check out flaming pie.There are 3 songs on the album that are worth the full price tho : Jenny Wrench, Fine line and Something in her eyes."
1,Not like older wings,"I don't know why I keep wasting my money buying McCartney stuff lately....., Driving rain, same, Choas & Creation same...Just not like old wings stuff, nor other McCartney albums. Where's the old rocker stuff??"
2,Uneventful,"First, McCartney is such a giant that any new music from him should be welcomed. If you think of any of the great composers of popular music in the last one hundred years (Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers, Bacharach, Irving Berlin, etc.), none of them did much good work in their sixties. They all hit their stride in their twenties, thirties, and forties. I am happy that McCartney is still having a go at it. That being said, this is a weak album. It is totally forgettable. I have to wonder if he worked at these melodies - they have the appearance of being lazy and show little effort. Gone are the days when he did take after take or let a song percolate in his memory for months before committing it to the recording studio. Paul is a good family man, a genius of popular music, a great rocker. His best creative work appears to be behind him. Nothing wrong with that. He can perform his back catalogue for years and we will love him for it."
3,Get Back to what made you famous...Rock-n-roll,"For all the hype about this Cd it sure left be wondering where the hit was on the CD. I kept waiting and when the last song was over......I thought, wow was this the former Beatle, or was this someone trying to go in a new direction and got lost.All solo performances, and very dull, I did listen to it a second time to see if I had missed something, I didn't and was VERY dissapointed with a new release that was hyped up to be the next Sgt Pepper.I guess once a Beatle you always expect Beatles or even Wings style music. Sir Paul......wake up and give your fans what they want...what George Harrison gave us, The Traveling Wilburys got it right with the 1st album they made. George is now looking like the only Beatle that was not only quite, but came on stong in the end."
5,Awesome !,"This is an excellent album.Songs like Jenny Wren,Too much rain,Riding to vanity fair stand alongside Paul's best works.There is an overall introspective,moody feel to the album - which is probably a reflection of Paul's current life.Without any doubt this is a great album."
4,A solid effort,"Paul McCartney since the break up of the Beatles has been inconsistant. Some of his albums have not even been worth listening to, and others are brilliant. Over the years I have bought just about all of them and I have to say I have only kept a few.Chaos and Creation in the Backyard is one of the few that is Beatle quality. Paul seems to come out of his rut, and like with Flaming Pie he has come up with an outstanding album.This is not only a fine album but some of the best songs he has ever written are on here.Songs of note are Fine Line and How kind of You and Friends to Go. Now for the best ever. Jenny Wren is along the lines of Blackbird. The guitar is very similar. Paul has really outdone himself on that one.There is also a song called Engish Tea that I find myself listening to over and over.Paul is British and I love songs that sound British, this is a real treat. This is for Beatles fans as well as McCartney fans."
5,my review,"from fine line to jenny wren paul manages to put together another one of those albums, like a fine wine to be savored over the years and to age with beauty and grace. audrey"
2,Ho hum,"McCartney hasn't put out anything relevant or memorable since ""Band on the Run."" That was 32 years ago, and sadly he should have quit while he was ahead. It's too bad that his reputation has been sullied by ""Silly Love Songs,"" ""Let Em In,"" ""Goodnight Tonight,"" ""Say Say Say,"" etc.Sorry Paul, this newest album may be a critical favorite (what are THEY smoking?), but radio and the public won't bite. Boring, unimaginative lyrics and melodies."
1,Angry at these Reviews,"I went and bought this album because of all the 5 star ratings and got it home and found it abysmal. The lyrics are trite and undeveloped, the music is just rehash and too short- Paul raids his whole catolog of songs to rip off of and it's just more of the same- I've listened to it more than once and it's just garbage. I prefer ""Driving Rain"" better than this, at least it had some rockers on it- this is just hospital waiting room music- some of it is just pure torture. I'm going to have to trade this CD now and I hope I can get something out of it."
1,Chaos and Creation in my car,"After I bought the cd, I put it into the cd player and cruised down the highway expecting some good stuff. What I got made me yearn for ""Octopus's Garden"", ""Your Mother Should Know"", or maybe even something from Yoko.... and I've always liked McCartney!I hated it. It was drivel. It was weak lyrically and musically. Sir Paul was trying to be Sir Mathis. If I wanted syrup, I'd listen to my wife's Josh Groban collection. (Naw, that's asking too much.)Fortunately, by the time I got home, I put in ""I am the Walrus"" and I woke from my near coma."
1,more of the same...,"What happened? Did he finally dig into his millions/billions to ""buy"" all the reviewers too? C'mon, even snippets will tell you it is more syrupy junk from a true talent that no longer has Lennon to tell him ""NO"". Lennon, probably the the best that rock ever had to offer, served as a competition and a sounding board during the Beatle days, and McCartney grew and basked in that true glory. Since the break-up he has surrounded himself with worshippers that will not tell the emperor that he has no clothes. What ever he once had(the Beatles), he no longer has and is a sad old man. Don't buy the hype OR the disk."
2,"Some Promise, Same Old Flaws","First of all, let me say that the really sad song, Riding To Vanity Fair is a flawless record. It already may rank right up there with the Long and Winding Road in my book.By his own admission, McCartney has often been ""in his element"" aping the style of a popular artist or record. In the case of Vanity Fair, it's pure Beck from Sea Change - down to using the instruments from Golden Age (track #1 coincidentally)Other songs are trivialized by trite, rushed lyrics - a worsening problem for Paul lately. The handful of tunes with true promise here are reduced to throw-aways by throw away lyrics.Oh, and ""Jenny Wren"" isn't a sequal to Blackbird, it the sequal to ""Put It There - and its irritating, to be kind."""
2,Be Careful Fans,This is good CD but it is not what the critics say. I was little disapointed in it and probably now have to make a decision whether to keep it or sale it back to the store that I got it. It does not remind me early days of the Beatles or Paul himself. Be careful of the critics on this one
2,Ham On The Run,"Far be it from mortal me to attempt to knock a legend off his pedestal, but, sick of hearing, every few years when Sir Paul releases a new album that it's `his comeback!' `He hasn't been this good in years!!' `The best since the 70s!!!' Please, Rock-N-Roll Hall of Fame solo be damned, he's never released a masterpiece [closest was his almost-covers CD post-Linda, a fine tribute to 50s nostalgia]. While not as lethargic as `Driver Rain', or cringe-inducing as his last live opus, this is still a major annoyance. He was balanced by John, George and Ringo in the 60s, unbalanced by Linda and - who else? - ever since. My grade: B-"
4,very good,"This cd is very good. It sounds like great old Mccartney - back to Mccartney I or Ram and even some hints at Beatles. But so what? It's 2006 and that was almost 40(!)years ago. ""Driving Rain"" sounded like great new Mccartney and playing with his band brought a fresh energy. I think the producer went absolutely the wrong direction having Mccartney play all the instruments himself and I'd rather see him back in the studio with his band."
3,really good,"Aside from the most embarrasingly corny 1800's flute solo in English Tea that makes me feel like i'm marching with George Washington maybe a bit TOO much, this is a pretty good record. Having grown up listening to the Beatles in my dad's record collection, there is a certain nostalgia that comes with his voice. However, i've yet to really like much of anything after Wings. And even with that, i'm a wayward fan. I love what Goodrich did with Radiohead and Beck so i was pretty sure i could trust the collaboration. I think for the most part, i was right. I love the slower moody songs. I was never big on his sappy happy's but... they're still good. I heard Jenny Wren and i was sold. Haven't bought Paul's solo stuff in a long time. Actually... ever. I have Beatles records and thats it. Confident i'd enjoy it, i gave this one a chance without even hearing much of it. Its still got some clunkers (and that flute solo) but more often than not, i like what i'm hearing."
2,Content Protected,"I like the CD and would normally rate it with 4 stars.However, what Amazon.com doesn't tell you is: this CD is content protected - hence I cannot put a lossless copy onto my NAS which makes hearing this CD a hassle.Thus, I cannot rate it with more than 2 stars."
4,A Strong Release by McCartney,"Chaos and Creation offers a strong element of solid songwriting throughout the album. ""Fine Line,"" ""How Kind of You,"" ""Jennie Wren,"" and ""At the Mercy"" are the first four songs on this and four of the strongest songs on the album, melodically, harmonically, and lyrically.The album continues with ""Friends to Go,"" a catchy folk rock song. On his ""Chaos and Creation"" TV special, Paul describes ""Friends to Go"" as what sounded to Paul like a ""George song."" The CD continues with ""English Tea,"" a catchy piano number complete with orchestral accompaniment in typical Paul fashion.Most of the tracks are catchy and melodic, and the album has the effect of pulling you in. The last track is a simple piano ballad titled ""Anyway,"" which has a lulling quality and feeling of completeness. Overall, Chaos and Creation is a strong release from an artist whose career has spanned decades."
5,Paul McCartney's best collection of songs since The Beatles... or maybe ever!,"I've listened to C&C; 5 times straight through since I bought it yesterday and it just gets better and better. These are beautifully crafted songs, brilliantly arranged , sung and played with sincerity and heart. It's an album that satisfies both emotionally and intellectually and well I just love it! IMO it's Paul's best collection of songs ever, especially Jenny Wren, Too Much Rain, English Tea, Friends To Go, Riding to Vanity Fair, Fine Line, Anyway & Promise to you Girl. And the others are quickly growing on me ;-) This album is/will be a classic!P.S.The DVD in the special edition is well worth the extra dollars... great interviews with Paul and producer Nigel Godrich, performances by Paul, the Fine Line and How Kind of You music videos and an clever little segment that's hard to describe called Line Art."
5,"C'mon, people .....",".... it's MACCA!!!!!!This is a true return-to-form for one of Britain's most popular knights. Then again, my opinion of anything Beatles-related is purely biased since none of them (living or dead) can do any wrong in my eyes (and ears).""Fine Line"" is an awesome opener to this first release from Sir Paul in 4 years. ""Jenny Wren"" is an instant favorite as well .... You simply cannot go wrong when Paulie picks up his acoustic guitar!Good job, Mr. McCartney! But then again, I'm not at all surprised.Do yourselves a favor, people - GET THIS!!!!!"
4,It will grow on you...Give it a chance,When I first heard this album I was skipping over certain songs but when I was listening to it in the back ground I was noticing more and more things I liked. Now I don't skip over any of the songs. Each is unique in it's own way. Give it a chance and hopefully you will see what I see.
2,"NOTHING PERSONAL, SIR, BUT YOU SHOULD'VE KEPT THE BAND","Seeing so many used discs (of Chaos & Creation) selling cheap should've been a tipoff, but i plunged ahead - straight into the toilet; buying one, and trying really hard to find some depth, some quality, SOMETHING worth listening to. But, alas, i found little. Very little inspiration here at all. Maybe these songs could've used his BAND to inject some drive, some spunk, some imagination. Boring string arrangements (if playing one note can be called an arrangement), stale guitar parts, drum machines. God, what a bollocks from such a talented songwriter and musician. Paul, re-hire your band before they get away! Please!"
3,Tried to like it...,"...and failed.I'm a huge McCartney fan but this album, like the last one, just didn't cut it. I've already forgotten Driving Rain and this one's going right next to it. I'll check out the bonus DVD and maybe that'll give me a different perspective but as for this one... I'm a little disappointed. Sorry, Paul!"
2,Disappointing,"This album really isn't a very good effort by McCartney. The only decent tracks on the CD are ""Fine Line"", ""Friends To Go"", and, what I think is the best track, ""English Tea"", which is really a lovely song. The other ten tracks are totally forgettable and aren't distinctive at all. The album is short and appears to have been quickly thrown together. He has done much better stuff in the past - I usually love his albums - but he misses the mark with Chaos and Creation."
1,Where is the Real Paul???,"All the hype, and all the expectant results are missing from this very simple, boring offering by Sir Paul. In a few of the songs I really thought this legendary artist was going to start singing the Barney song... ' I love you, you love me etcc...' Want some quality offerings by an ex-Beatle? Check out Ringo Stars most recent release. This offering by Paul again makes us long for and truly miss John Lennon. Dont even think of listening to some of Paul's solo work prior to this, ie: Band on the Run, Venus and Mars, etc.. as you will become even more disenchanted with this poor offering."
1,chaos; no creation,"It's interesting how this CD can generate so many five star reviews and plenty of 1 star reviews. I took a chance and bought this- after all, I have every Paul CD and then some. After several listens, I just had to read these 5 star reviews again. Are these folks listening to the same CD I am? I get the feeling these 5 star reviewers would basically rate anything by Paul 5 stars. I'm a huge fan, but this CD is extremely boring. If it wasn't Paul, I'd never listen to it again. I won't bother with the song by song analysis, because frankly, they all sound the same. Nothing memorable. Comments about this being ""dentist-office muzak"" are right on the mark. I can only hope his next is better."
4,Enjoyable for any McCartney fan,"If you are a McCartney fan you'll enjoy ""Choas"". Paul's writing is a bit dark and subdued but very melodic. It took a couple of listens to get the feel of the album but I get the sense that he put alot of effort into this one and it basically shows where he is at today at age 63. Definitely worth a serious listen."
1,John was right...,Disapointment doesn't come close to describing this album. I should have known better than to take a chance and give it a listen. I saw all the positive reviews here on Amazon and I thought that maybe it was possible that he'd achieved something the likes of which I haven't heard from him since the Beatles and early Wings. This album is PAINFUL to listen to. That he can't write himself out of a paper bag is nothing new. But the vocals are atrocious as well! After listening to this album I immediately replayed Let It Be just to remind myself that he used to be able to sing.
2,An appropriate title Paul.,"I had just seen the Paul McCartney tour and was hooked on the melody of Jenny Wren. The problem with this cd is that it is essentially light weight fluff that you will listen to once and put away in your collection. Paul is still wonderful in concert but this cd was a disappointment - the rock doesn't rock, and alot of the material sounds forced and empty."
2,Are we listening to the same CD?,"Chaos and Creation is a dreadful dirge of McCartney sappiness. The songs are an endless blend of ballads where it's hard to hear where one song picks up and the other leaves off. I'd like to here McCartney make some rock-n-roll again. Maybe he could team up with Ringo Starr, who could show him how it's done. All of you who like this CD are probably the same ones who liked Brian Wilson's ""Smile"", another example of washed up old musicians who just don't know when to retire."
1,Sad,So sad that a brilliant musician like Paul McCartney is putting out trash like this. Folks dont waste your money.The lyrics sound like they were written by a 10 year old....
1,Oh my God - what a bad album,"I swore I wouldn't buy another McCartney album after being totatlly disappointed with ""Run Devil Run"" and ""Driving Rain."" But I gave in to the temptation, hoping against hope I wouldn't be let down a third time.I was let down a third - and final - time.Oh my God, what a bad album! Mindless dribble, poor production, lousy orchestration, it goes on and on. I swear, I knew the next lyric before it was sung! Trite, overused, uninspired libretto.So, with that said, I recommend that no one buy this piece of trash. The music of McCartney - enjoy the ""old"" stuff because the well has run dry....."
1,Paul IS Dead....,"Well, I watched the DVD over the weekend and I'm listening to ""Chaos"" for the 2nd time now. This guy is on autopilot! He needs to join a band - maybe the Wilbury's? All the songs sound like demos, especially after watching the DVD. This Nigel producer guy pretty much fiddled with a few knobs and let McCartney do what he wanted, including play all the instruments. Where's the creative challenge in that? This is the audio equivalent of masturbation. In front of a picture window. On a crowded city street.Have you noticed the resemblance between the covers of ""Bigger Bang"" and ""Back to the Egg""? Maybe Paul should join the Stones!"
4,Nice music from McCartney,Nice music if you like McCartney. I do so I enjoyed it. Still laid back and not very upbeat. It fits nicely into my collection.
2,impulsive?,"i bought this record i don't know why. i heard a few tracks and thought it sounded ok.i listened to it once and it sounded so blase. i don't really know what i expected. i have add so sometimes lyrics don't really matter-- the rocking of the music does, which may be why i like jazz so much, because it doesn't have words. neither here nor there.any way: and yes i know this isn't really much of a review: i think this is a record the casual observer may pick up for whatever reason and thrust aside. i think this is one that one must make a conscious effort to listen to and appreciate for what it is.first listenl-- not impressed. but give it a chance."
5,go Paul go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved Paul Mccartney since 2004.I love this cd my forite songs are: Too much rain, How kind of you, English tea and Jenny Wren"
2,Are you kidding?,"Wow...what a letdown. This album is nothing spectacular. I'm talking music only--not even counting Paul's voice or lyrics. I'm wondering what kind of person gives this kind of album rave reviews? I'm a big McCartney fan, but there must be people that blindly love everything that falls out of this man's mouth."
1,He should have left this in the backyard,"This is not even elevator music, and I don't mean that in a good way either. To think that Sir Paul actually is dragging the name of his former partner as a source of inspiration for this confused clutter is truly an injustice to Mr. Lennon's memory.Most of the melodies are disjointed and the lyrics are pedestrian. I could take the time to review each tune, but why bother when they blend together as one unforgettable and regrettable mess."
2,disappointing,"when i read all the positive review's of this CD i figured i could't go wrong. unfortunately that was not the case. there are a few good songs on the CD, but i just couldn't get into it (and this was after multiple listenings). sorry paul..."
4,"Enjoyable, closer to his classics","Paul McCartney's new album is very good. The music and production on the songs are especially impressive. McCartney really did well playing the instruments and credit must go to the producer. If there's anywhere the album fails, it's the lyrics which at times recall Paul's worst. But for the better part of the album they are at least tolerable and sometimes quite good. They do hold the album back from being a true classic, though. They don't really hurt the album very much, just hold it back a bit. I have been listening to it all week and like it more and more. The best songs are Friends to Go, English Tea, Too Much Rain and Promise to you Girl. The others are also good, but not quite. Overall, a return to better days for Paul and highly recommended."
5,Best In Quite Awhile,"This is not just McCartney's best in over a decade. It ranks among the best of all 2005 releases. Unlike most of Macca's catalog, this album contains all solid efforts, there's not one bad track; even the tacked on bonus instrumental works. One striking aspect of this work is the absence of the catchy but somewhat cloying compositions which Paul has occasionally delivered. There's many solid melodies here but they don't tend to stick in your head; instead you want to revisit them and discover something that you missed the last time. Some of the credit undoubtedly must go to Nigel Godrich who apparently imposed some much needed discipline. Whereas I don't particularly appreciate the efforts of some other artists Mr. Godrich has produced, namely Radiohead and Beck, the man is obviously talented. However, it's the great artist that he's produced, namely Paul McCartney, who deserves most of the credit for adding this stellar effort to his immense body of work!"
5,McCartney's done it again,"One word... MagnificentSir Paul McCartney, to me is THE greatest song writer/performer ever, even 30 years after the beatles, paul has still got it."
5,no chaos but loads of creation in macca's backyard,"Macca's finest album to date...stunning, simple powerful melodic thoughtful.The catchy FINE LINE the haunting TOO MUCH RAIN the sweet airy JENNY WREN the flowing ease of his vocals on ANYWAY ...i can't stop playing this damn album and with every play it gets better!!!!"
1,What happened?,"I consider myself a McCartney fan however I'm not a fanatic and that's why I'm able to give an honest review of this album. After listening to it I have to say that It wasn't what I'd expected it really lack flavor. I tried my hardest to like it to find something that got me singing along I just couldn't find it. ""Flaming Pie"" for me was a better album. My advise have a friend make you a copy don't buy it until you hear it. Next time he should try Jeff Lynne to produce him he did a great job with George's last Album don't you think? I give this album one star because I had to"
2,Chaos and Medication?,"Let me first start by saying I am a huge Beatle and McCartney fan. So after reading some of the pre-reviews I was very much looking forward to Sir Paul's new CD. Well, it is a monster disappointment. Gone are the catchy hooks and inspiring craftsmanship we long ago have come to expect from Paul. The songs are drab, slow and dare I say? Boring. Not one upbeat rocker in the lot. Virtually all the songs come across as introspective meanderings that just fall flat. I rate this LP right up there with McCartney II which was filler music from the first track to the last. This? John Lennon said it best; ""the sound you make is muzak to my ears"". Really folks this is elevator music."
2,Preaches instead of rocks,"He's showing his age by preaching. No doubt the over 40 set (that's me) will dig this CD, for nostalgic reasons. But does this CD represent something, new, fresh,or different? Nah!"
1,LONGTIME BEATLE FAN DISAPPOINTED-so far.,"I've listened to the CD only twice so far, but can't seem to get into it. From the above reviews, people are liking it, so I'll keep on listening/hoping.All but two songs are acoustic, and I love folk.Must keep on listening!"
1,Columbus,"Interviews with author were a little sketchy. No emphasis on religious motives of columbus. No maps or dates, for example, how long did it take. No mention of the fact that Columbus had Marco Polos book with him. Very brief mention of what the Portugesse were doing and next to nothing about the spice trade.Room for improvement."
4,Excellent Series,"For those who have enjoyed the excellent Pennyfoot Hotel series by Ms. Kingsbury, this series will prove delightful, moving from the Victorian era to the English countryside during World War II in a manor house setting."
4,cute fluffly novel to pass a winter's day,This was a cute little cozy mystery. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice lite read.
3,"Lots of Good information, not a lot of words",The book has a lot of valuable information for those who are working in computer vision. The book however is fairly terse on many subject and requires careful reading.
4,Comment on the first edition,"The first edition of this book could have been much better written. It took up a lot of topics, but treated each in a summary fashion. In fairness, though, I must say that this may be as good as any other book with its aim and scope, and better than some. Any writer on computer vision faces the problem of guessing who the reader is likely to be and what the reader's background is. Also, each of the various topics really merits a sizable book. In particular, the mathematics needs a truly mathematical treatment in a separate book. I have not seen this second edition, but there was room for improvement over the first edition."
3,paperback,I do not want to talk about the content of the book. It is cited by a lot of paper and many researchers use this book in computer vision.But it is paperback. And the papers are not soft. So the book does not keep the position when you set a page and put on the desk. If you want the book to keep its position you need to disrupt binding. So the printing office should release the hardcover version of the book. Or you should buy the 1st edition. Its paper quality is better than 2nd edition.
4,Great bag for the price,"This bag is an economical fix for those of us who do not want the bulk of a laptop bag, or need to carry more than a traditional briefcase style laptop bag can hold. It fits my 12"" Averatec notebook snugly, and has fairly good padding to protect it. Recommended if you need something to protect your laptop while carrying to/from work or school in another bag."
4,I give this a 4.80 for not being a complete collection,"Many of the after school specials were brilliant. They entertained while giving us life lesson with small morality plays. Alcoholism, drug abuse, divorce, and teen parenthood were addressed. I enjoyed everyone of them and made a point to learn from the kids plights and mistakes. Unfortunately Amy and the Angel, one of my favorites that dealt with depression and teen suicide is missing from this series so I can't give it a 5th star. That doesn't mean the series isn't good. Just that I found it lacking for not being a complete collection. If you want to go down memory lane. This series is awesome. If your looking for films to watch with your kids and have a discussion about the subject matter afterward then its a 5 star purchase."
1,"Where is ""The Last of the Curlews""? This collection is a disgrace!","How can you call this a deluxe collection when it does not even include the first original episodes including the amazing and heart-wrenching animated film that started it all ""The Last of the Curlews""? This is not a collection, it is a disgrace!"
3,"Where is ""The Wave""",I still remember this episode but just found out the title. Why isn't it included in the set? Anyone know?
4,Very nice....but not universal,"The quality of this quiver is VERY nice. The description, however, said nothing about it being a RH quiver which is a problem since I am a LH shooter. Just be aware of this."
4,Works as advertised,"Thin and easy to place. Should last for a long time under normal conditions. The listing says that it has grid lines for easy placement and cutting. IT DID NOT HAVE GRID LINES. I wish it had, it would have made cutting much easier. Overall, I think this is a good product. Giving 4 stars because of the missing grid lines."
2,Unreliable,I was using these DVDs to create home movies. Less than 40% of these actually worked. I used studio and a couple of other DVD writing programs.
2,Not what I was looking for.,"This product looked great on onscreen and I'm sure it would be good if we were to use it. But it was big and would take up way to much space in our little room. Additionally, my husband and I couldn't figure out how it should work. We contacted the seller for a return authorization number and was quickly assisted."
2,Not indestructible!,"Although these seem to be made well, they are not indestructible or for 'aggressive and persistent chewers' as the label suggests. My 8 month old german shepherd was pulling stuffing out within an hour of giving it to her. Granted, very few toys last with her (thank God for KONG!) but I had high hopes for this one. Just more money down the drain."
5,Huge Difference in energy!,"I had been on other B-complex vitamins taking as many as 7 a day. No comparison to Solaray product - I take 3 a day and feel vibrant!! I noticed the first day the difference in energy and alertness. I know when I have missed a dose. Caution: I can not take after 3 pm and be able to get to sleep at night. Maybe some will not have this problem, but I offer it as my experience."
5,Love anything Carol Doak does,Instructions make paper piecing easy. Even miniatures. If you follow her instructions closely you cannot go wrong. The book was used but was in perfect condition.
2,Stuhrling who?,"Ordered the watch first and it was never shipped. Finally got the watch after calling customer service and getting it re-shipped. Admittedly, this is the fault of Amazon and not Stuhrling.Beware this automatic self wind watch. It states there is a 36 hour power reserve but having worn the watch for a whole day and taking it off before bed, it had stopped by the following morning. The watch stopped for good on January 6th at 4.20pm. Can't blame the battery (there isn't one).Deployment buckle clasp is awkward to use but you get used to it after a while. I chose this watch after reading the blurb on Stuhrling's website and some positive reviews on Amazon.com. I should have trusted my instincts and gone with a more known brand.Also, take any ""positive"" reviews about Stuhrling watches with a pinch of salt. Stuhrling offers a free one year warranty extension just for leaving positive feedback."
2,Gorgeous watch . . . for a GIANT!,"I initially purchased this watch as a birthday gift for my husband, but when I opened it up I couldn't believe my eyes -- it is HUGE! The watch is really beautiful, but the dial is enormous, and the metal is unusually thick. Unless you are an Extra Large man, you are going to have difficulty carrying off this watch. I unfortunately had to return it and find another more appropriate option for my husband."
4,Good Product,The watch was a gift. It arrived ahead of time and was packaged well. My friend was very happy with it and to this day has not had a problem with it. I do recomend this seller.
5,Sexy belly chain: great rhinestones and durable!!,This was a wonderful purchase before a Vegas trip a few weeks ago. It was sexy and I was able to swim in the water with it. Never caught on the bikini or tangled. The piece that latches it where you want it to stay actually did fall off (or maybe I caught it on something and pulled?) but was a simple repair. One of my favorite purchases... and nobody else was wearing one. Very fun!!
3,Good debut,"Very good novella to start the book, but the following short stories were less interesting. Owen provides excellent narration and character development but maybe lacks the great story ideas that his brother and father come up with. Owen appears to be more mainstream. I loved the title story. It had endearing characters and great twists at the end that I did not see coming. I hated for it to end, but not a whole lot happened. There were a bunch of great lines and insights into his main character, but some things came off as phony Hollywood. Owen is clearly another real talent in the family."
2,Very disappointed,I was very disapponted with this book. The beginning of the strories were OK but the endings were dumb and boring.
3,First disappointment in the Kings,"I love Stephen, Tabitha and Joe Hill-I was sure I would love Owen. It's completely readable and critically acclaimed but not my kind of thing."
4,"So far, very good","I have only read the first two stories so far, and am looking forward to the rest. Wow. I hope Mr. King decides to continue this career path. He has the skill and gift of drawing you into the characters, and keeps you turning the pages."
4,Very Enjoyable Book...,"I was very pleased with this book, and I hope that Owen King continues to write. I look forward to a full length novel from him in the near future, because this collection of short stories has left me wanting to hear more from Mr. King. Great all around book, that I highly reccomend."
4,A Novella & Stories great stories,This was actually a pretty good book. What I liked is it is not his father's work. Which makes him a man in his own rights. Excellant stories and not only one which made it not boring. Overall I think he'll do well for himself and not need daddies name.
3,Not impressed,"I had a really hard time getting into this book. It was well written, just not very captivating. If you are interested in reading this book, purchase it used and save yourself some money."
1,Not the complete event !! Buy at your own disgression,"I bought this for only one reason. I collect the Corrs. There is no mention anywhere on the DVD of the Corrs and after watching everything, including the extras, they were nowhere to be seen or heard. This was badly edited and other artists were cut out including Alicia Keys, although she did make an appearance in ""The making of.."" .It's over 2 hours of mainly foreign performers, mostly Italian (it was afterall in Rome}. So if you are American, you probably only know of Carlos Santana (who doesn't)and possibly Zachuro? (not sure I spelled that right but he has had Sharon Corr play violin with him}. The former having the most time alloted on this disc.Seeing it once was more than enough for me!!Anyone want to buy a used one really cheap ???"
3,the pretender,i love this show they dont make them any better bought it without pause but buyer beware it says complete seris its not their are episodes missing. was a little disappointed!The Pretender - Seasons 1 - 4
2,Did I buy this new ?,I have gone threw the third season and it has breaks in play and seems to have wash marks and scrathes
5,The Pretender A+++,"Great Product, arrived on time and was exactly as described. Would recommend and will definitely deal with this business in future!!!"
1,yet another good series ruined by clif hanger and non conclusive so called ending!!!.,"is this how loyal fans are appreciated by idiot ,greedy networks?. the pretender another brilliant successful series cancelled without any logical reason. this is totaly rediculious and insulting. what is the point of making a series and not having a conclusive ending . at the end of the day the fans have actualy wasted their time following the series. it is like watching a movie without being able to see the end.warning!!! if you have not seen this series yet , and although it has an exellent and intriguing plot , it would be a waste of time buying and viewing it as it has no ""real"" conclusive ending .(final episode ends on a rediculious cliffhanger).this was followed by two tv movies ,but still did not thoroughly conclude the story.the two tv movies have left the story even more inconclusive."
5,Courteous Seller,"I ordered the item very close to Christmas so I was disappointed that it did not make it quite on time, but that was due to my own late ordering. I did e-mail the seller, asking if it might make it by Christmas, and she was so courteous: even though it was MY fault for ordering late, she offered a full refund if it didn't make it by Christmas and I didn't need it. I thought that was impressive and a great way to build rapport with customers.Package came just as described, no damage, no problems. DVD's in perfect condition."
1,"Love the show, but you can find it cheaper...",Don't get me wrong - I LOVE the Pretender. I've seen each episode multiple times. The reason why it gets one star here? The PRICE! I got the ENTIRE SERIES from *cough-WalMart-cough* for $40. Total. Yep... that was a good day. :-)
4,Hansi does it again with Classics Up to Date #3,"A very enjoyable selection of old and new classics, some lightly pepped up with Hansi's unique interpretation, mixed in presentation for variety. A listener is hard pressed not to hum along and begin tapping their toes with Mattinata and Cavatine. Feuerwerksmusik urges your hands to start conducting. Haydn, Chopin, Haendel, Liszt and Tschaikowsky would be amused."
4,Dirty DVD,"This lens cleaner works great, but with that being said, they don't last forever, the lens cleaners get smegma in their little dust brushes as well, then you need to replace the lens cleaner. I do after about 10 to 15 uses."
5,Great for CD/DCD Maintenance,"This was originally purchased to determine if I needed to replace my 20 yr. old CD player. I ended up buying a new CD player. This product is great for periodically cleaning of the CD player lens. I also used it to clean the lens of my PS3. Anyone that has a CD, DVD, or game that has a lens should use this product for maintenance. Because of this lens cleaner. I hope my new CD player lasts as long as my old one. It really works."
2,Disappointing,"Only seems to be a little bit better than my old battery. It didn't come fully charged and is significantly lower by the end of the day. It may have something to do with my phone being too cold. But still, disappointing. I hate Nextel."
3,Get what you pay for,It works as a battery but the battery life is only a little better than the old one it replaced. You get what you pay for.
1,no good,I charged the new battery and it did NOT hold a charge any longer than my worn out battery. It will NOT go thru a whole day without having to be plugged into a charger. I request my money back for the I870 Nextel battery. thank You.Wanda Poole
5,Soothing Yet Informational,"I was looking for a way to learn more about Chakras while simultaneously getting in touch with my own, and this cd does just that. Her voice is very soothing, and I like how she interweaves the information about the individual chakras into the visualizations."
3,Love it BUT...,"Chitra is great and I would recommend her guided meditation to all. But, please, please, please get rid of the music. Her voice alone is sufficient - in fact it's perfect for guided meditation. I found the sound track would get in the way and after several listenings would irritate me."
2,Chakra-guided meditations to unleash your full potential,"I have hearing loss, particularly in the high ranges (women's voices), and can't understand what the woman is saying. This makes doing a guided meditation impossible. I've tried to listen twice to the first meditation and the background music overpowers the woman's voice. I can't rate this CD properly. It is probably fine but I will have to give it away to someone with better hearing."
5,"photo album, cozee world",I just love the uniqueness of these photo albums. Each one is so full of detail. You can't go wrong giving this as a gift. They are so beautiful.
5,"beautiful item, good price","Got this as a wedding gift for a friend. Item arrived in perfect condition, with a slip of paper explaining the origin of the materials, which was a nice touch. Very nice craftsmanship. Impressive gift at reasonable price."
2,"Tough one, this one...","I'm not at all new to the Merlin stories, but this book was way too deep into metaphores and the likes. I couldn't get through the first 50 pages. This book is something for native speakers, and I'm not sure of what language. Maybe scholars will find some gratification in Tolstoy's creation, but I'm putting this book at the bottom of my reading list. I AM going to start reading it again, however."
4,Very deep full of old English myth and legend.,"An alternative insight into the life of Merlin and his observation of the passing Dark Ages in Britain. The depth of the book is quite overpowering. Only for die hard Fans of English Mythology, but a good read all the same. As long as you stick at it!!"
4,Tough - but worth it!,"The Gaelic in the book does make for heavy going, so I do reccommend taking some time to go through the glossary at the back so you understand the pronounciation. This book is full of myth and is beautifully written - a real masterpiece."
3,Was Not As Shown in the Picture,"I bought this case to protect my husbands camera that he is using in Iraq. He has a Casio EXLIM and the case did fit it really well, but If your looking at the ""APE"" embelished case in the picture and thinking thats what you'll get, You're wrong. I received A black leather fold-over velcro-close case that is open in the bottom corners. It didn't even have the ""APE"" logo. I was disappointed as the case in the picture was what I was looking for, but I kept it and sent it on to my husband anyway. I suppose it will still serve its purpose. If you really want the product in the picture, buy from a different supplier on Amazon, or try [...]. Thats where I originally found it."
2,Does NOT hold 180 albums,"I have a collection of 162 LPs & I could only fit 129 in this case. I still have 33 LPs I can't put in! Perhaps it's because several albums I have are 2 record sets & some single disc albums have gatefold covers? It has a removable lid with 2 handles, one on each side & a carpeted covering, which makes it a nice footstool. If you have a cat, he might use it as a scratching post, though. If you plan to carry it with it full of albums, better use a hand truck! They should have made it like a suitcase with wheels. They should say it holds approximately 130 albums, not 180."
1,Misleading,"I don't know how they advertise this as being a 180 capacity unit -- it can hold about half of that, maybe 100 at best (if you really squished your records). It doesn't look too bad (if you don't mind black carpet cases), unfortunately mine came with the bottom wood base slightly warped, which really wouldn't be that big of a deal since records sit on top anyway, but it does further speak to bad design and quality (and poor marketing). I paid 80 bucks for this, overall, it would be worth it for about half of that amount."
4,"great, cheap compilation of surf songs from the sixties",this cd has some great songs on it. best cut is 'i live for the sun' and 'surf city'. also 'california sun'
4,Innovative and intense,"This is a brilliant adventure inspired by Celtic myths of shadowland - beneath the standing stones of Cahervaniel, an ominous chasm has sundered the hillside, and darkness now broods over the verdant lands beyond. Demons dance upon the hill, twisted minions skitter through the villages below, and innocents begin to disappear in the midst of night. It is up to the adventurers to descend into the ancient awakened netherworld, where no one else dares to venture."
4,So much better than the reviews I read here!,I read the reviews but certainly do not base what I read here on whether I will buy or enjoy a book. This is a great example of a book that I found much better than its reviews. I found this couple falling in love or initially lust so quickly and very believable. And lets face it when you buy a Johnson book you are looking for a little heate in the writing and this book certainly delievered on that score. Max and Christina really seemed to find a connection quickly and for me it was exciting and I enjoyed the read!! I would say give this book a chance if you are a Susan Johnson lover!!
2,It reads like a sex manual...,"The beginning of this book was all about graphic and lusty sex, and there was no substance to the story at all. I found Christina's indecisive skittishness to be teasingly annoying, and Max's promiscuity to be vulgar. It's not very believable that such a man who can't keep his zipper up would suddenly become a one-woman man after meeting Christina. The graphic language was a bit crude for my tastes.There's only so much erotica I could take before it got tedious and boring, so I nearly put the book down midstream. I'm glad I stuck with it because around page 150, the story picks up a considerable amount of depth. Christina and her cruel husband Hans return to Germany to celebrate Christmas with their sons and his very controlling family. Max is fiercely determined to help her escape this brutal marriage. When their affair is discovered, Hans attempts to severley punish her, and elements of suspense and adventure are introduced, redeeming the story."
1,A sad state of affairs,"It breaks my heart to see a writer as talented as Susan Johnson mistaking pornography for women's erotica. Having chararacters repeatedly use the ""F"" word and the ""C"" word as she has done in TEMPTED and in her last few books is hardly erotic, unless you're a 14-year-old boy. Women's erotica has the potential to be a delicious sub-genre within the romance genre with heroines experiencing explosive love scenes and exploring various forbidden fantasies, such as the captive fantasy. The whole point of women's erotica is that it's sexual fantasy as WOMEN long to read about it, not as some pale and sordid reflection of the male fantasy typified in your average men's magazine. I can only hope Ms. Johnson returns to the type of storytelling she does best--well-written stories about relationships where the two protagonists are capable of tenderness as well as lust."
2,Disappointing writing,"I do love a sexy romantic book and this book did give the sexy part, but it lacked in writing. Along with the romance part, I like to see a better story line. Right from the start with this book every character was cheating on his or her spouse -- right there is a turn off for me."
1,Might as well call it porn book,"Had to give it 1 star cuz there's no 0 star.I've read ALOT of romance novels and I can tell what's a good story when I read one, but Susan Johnson is definitely not a romance writer. There's no story nor character development. All there is just plain sex. You don't care about the characters cuz you don't know them. It's like watching porn show. The story is stupid and just excuses for the sex scene. You have no feelings for the characters cuz they're just plain porn stars!"
4,Hoping her writing finesse shines again in next book,"When I read the first three books of Elizabeth Haydon's series, I was overjoyed; here was an author whose written work was absolutely impeccable, whose voice totally resonated with me, and whose development/progression of characters, scene-setting, and story lines were all exceptionally considerate of her reader. I couldn't WAIT for Requiem to come on the book store's shelves.I was stunned when I read it. It seemed as though the book was put through the paces in rather a hurry, with only cursory attention given to editing (typos are NOT Elizabeth Haydon's style), and some of the writing seemed....well, forced. Although it was still a better book than many I've read, I expected better from this author.I am hoping she wins me back with the next book in the series."
3,It isn't as good as her first three,"This book feels like it was a ""have to"" book, where the publisher/writer feel the need to expand upon their previous successes with characters. The first three books are outstanding (Rhapsody, being the first) and I'd recommend them to anyone. Unfortunately, this one didn't live up to the story arcs or character development provided in that series."
1,Meant for little girls........,"If you are over 20 and looking for good reading, forget it. This series is meant for little girls.If you haven't read George R. R. Martin, you should do so. He writes to adults, not children and teenagers."
5,Pure Gold!,"Haydon does not disappoint in this excellent sequel to the Rhapsody trilogy. All the great and fascinating characters are there, plus a few surprising ones from the past. This book is brilliantly paced and plotted, and reminds me very much of the Strunk & White writing primer dictum: ""Make every word tell."" There are some splendid twists to this story, and every one of them is foreshadowed if you read carefully enough.Of course, the wry humor (especially Grunthor's) was enough to make me laugh out loud in more than a few places, which coupled with the satisfying action and further character development, make this a book you simply can't put down.While this novel stands on its own, it is much richer if the reader has read the trilogy first. I was very pleased to note that Haydon left some threads on which to start her next novel in this series, which can't come soon enough for me!BRAVO!!"
3,a little tedious,wanted to start this sreies but after reading this one realized that it was in the middle and it was flashing back in time and everyone was new character. not time for this.
1,Warning- looks like the rest of the series may not be written,"Just a quick note that this is an unfinished series. There were supposed to be five books in this series but only the first three have been written, with the last being published in 2006. Nothing has been heard from the author regarding this series in years. It's quite likely this series will never be finished and it left everything hanging. Very unsatisfying."
3,a little disapointing,I think that compared to the other books that this one wasn't as good. It left so much open and so much more to be desired. I felt that it needed to continue but since the other book is coming out soon maybe my hope will come true. There was such conviction in the other books that made you forget where you were and feel one with the story where as this one made you feel seperate and slightly uninterested.
2,Definitely odorless but watch out for fruit flies,"This countertop compost keeper is sleek-looking and definitely odor-free to the human nose. I was enjoying it immensely until I started seeing fruit flies in my kitchen. It takes us a couple of weeks to fill the compost keeper and during that time hundreds and hundreds of fruit flies had made it their home. I was so disgusted, I through the whole thing in the garbage."
4,"spiffy, but functional","as mentioned - this won't eliminate the fruit fly problem, but it is easy to use and empty. We generally empty it often enough that smell isn't a problem. The fruit flys are so annoying that it is kept outside the kitchen door until we get a killing frost."
1,Fruit flies,"We had a compost bucket made out of plastic, and we replaced it with this model. We've been very unhappy with the Norpro model. The lid is hard to remove, requiring two hands; one hand has to hold the bucket and the other hand has to pull up the lid. But the worst thing is the fruit flies. With our old plastic bucket, we never had fruit flies. With the Norpro model, the fruit flies are everywhere because the lid doesn't seal properly."
4,canister,"I recently bought another Norpro as it works really well. There is no smell in the kitchen and no fruit flies. The only thing reason we are replacing the old one, which I have had 2 yrs is that the lid ring has slit in several places and you can not get it back on. It started in one place and then others opened up. Tried to hammer it back but doesnt stay tight. Overall though we are satisfied with the product just wish it had lasted longer then 2 yrs since it is stainless steel."
3,"looks nice, but...","The lid sticks, so if it's closed all the way in order to open it I have to hug the can to my chest while pulling on the lid. Oiling the rim with canola oil didn't help. The last thing I want to hug to my chest is a half-full kitchen compost can. I leave the lid partially open and empty the can frequently. I haven't noticed any odor."
3,"Great size, no smell--interior starting to discolor","I've had this for about three months. I'm happy with its relatively small footprint for the amount that it holds, how easy it is to clean, and how well it prevents odors. After three months, however, it has started to develop tiny rust spots on the interior. I think some sort of liner bags may be a necessary accessory for the long-term use of this product."
3,Looks great but...,"This compost keeper is the perfect thing for starting to compost. It holds alot of waste and looks great on the counter. Just one thing, there are a ton of fruit flies."
1,Unusable after 3 months because side split,"I bought this compost pail with a mother's day gift certificate and loved it. However after 3 months of use including washing after emptying the pail in my garden, I found the side right under where the handle connected had split about 2 inches at what appears to be a seam in the metal. I have not found any product guarantee. I have an extra brand new filter set that I won't be able to use."
4,Works well but had a problem. Norpro fixed it.,"We purchased this item from Amazon a little over a year ago. It has worked well. We have had a few fruit flies occasionally but certainly not an intolerable amount. There never was any oder eminating from it when the lid was on.After 14 months the bucket developed three small pin holes on the bottom. (Very unusual for stainless steel.) It leaked onto our counter top so it was pretty much useless. I sent a picture of it to Norpro and they sent me another bucket. Since I have only observed a sample of one I cannot say if this is a persistent problem, but at least Norpro took care of the problem."
4,No odor - looks good!,"Very nice looking - blends right into the kitchen. Have had it for several weeks - put stuff in it on the first day - still not a hint of odor. Lid fits very snugly - have to work it a bit to get it open sometimes, but better than being too loose. Would order it again."
2,"Looks great, but doesn't perform","I was so excited when I first received this. As others say, it looks fantastic and is large enough to hold a lot of food waste. HOWEVER, after just a few months of use, it smells really bad (even after multiple cleanings and filter changes) AND the metal seal on the top is coming apart. I've now taken out the filters altogether and it still looks good, but the top is really hard to get on and off.For this price, I'd expect a higher quality item. Maybe the old tupperware container wasn't so bad after all??"
2,"Waste of Money, it stinks (literally), and filters stink worse","This item is a good size and looks fine. But that's about all I can say good about it. The filter makes it smell like dead fish! After only one use! You might as well buy any air tight kitchen anister and use it the same way. If you don't want smell, you have to empty it every day. But even after washing it out with soapy water, it still stinks because the filter retains the fish-like smell even when it's practically new. Waste of $$. buy any old container to use for food waste!"
5,Perfect size,"I have bought a lot of Norpro Products in the past year. Each one has satisfied my needs. This one I was worried about because of other negative reviews. I have nothing negative to say about this compost pot. It even looks good sitting on my countertop. After a month of use, no oders are emitting from it. I think the key is to never get the filter in the cover wet. It cleans up easy after emptying. I like the feel of the rubber coated handle that also acts as a bumper guard so the handle wont ding the side of the pot. Now I only go to the compost pile once a week instead of every day. The size is perfect for this 2 person household."
2,Top of container,PLease help me--first of all the top is very difficult to remove and also --the comes apart from the filter portion --we are not happy with this
2,Disappointing Product,"We ordered this item to hold our table scraps for our compost pile. However, the items we put into it molded after only two days in the container. While there is a carbon filter to remove the odors, there is no way to get ventilation into it to dry up the material so it won't rot.We were quite disappointed in this product and cannot recommend it."
1,A hole developed in the bottom!,"I LOVED this mighty kitchen compost container. It is sleek looking, easy to keep clean, and contains just enough for my family's week's worth of table waste. However, last week I discovered that the bottom now has a hole in it! Somehow, something (acidic food?) created a hole and my compost was leaking all over my kitchen counter. What gives with that? It was less than six months old."
1,Faulty lid,"Don't waste your money. Lids warp, and don't close properly. No response from Amazon or Norpro when I wrote to complain. Don't buy!!!!"
1,Disappointed,"Within a day or two of using the Compost Keeper, the lid separated into two pieces. The top section came off leaving the bottom piece still sitting in the keeper. I returned it to Amazon."
5,really great,The Norpro Grip EZ Stainless Steel Compost Keeper is easy to clean and very easy to use. Highly recommend for any home owner.
1,Absolutely terrible,"This book has got to be the worst example of a biography ever! In fact, it does not deserve to be called a biography. The author has rehashed old information and most of it is totally inaccurate and certainly not researched. There are many spelling errors and in the end, Joan Fontaine remains an unknown woman, at least to the author and the readers of this trash. For someone who buys this book looking for an insight into the great star of the golden age of cinema, disappointment will be theirs. In you want to read a literate. well-written account of Miss Fontaine's life seek out her delightful and highly readable autobiography ""No Bed of Roses."" I hope Miss Fontaine does not read this ""account"" of her life! Miss Joan Fontaine, a magnificent actress, deserves much, much better than this unauthorized ""Letters from a Known Woman."""
2,Not well-written,"It is ironic that this ""biography"" of a very intelligent, literate actress is so poorly written. I see that other people have mentioned that so I won't reiterate. I feel this author had his heart in the right place, he just needed more guidance from his publisher and a proofreader in writing about his knowledge of Miss Fontaine. I found his telling of the shabby treatment of Joan by her mother, Lilian Fontaine and sister, Olivia, to be heartbreaking. I have been a fan of Joan Fontaine a long time and nothing new was revealed to me about her life or her relationship with her family. Her autobiography is a much, much better and revealing account of her life story and certainly more complete than the information in this slim book."
3,Too fast,The content is pretty good but the CD goes way too fast. It would have been nice if they repeated things three times instead of going it over once REALLY fast.
2,"Northern dialect, uses vocab w/o introducing it","Like some other posters, I grew up in a Vietnamese household but stopped speaking it once I entered Kindergarten because I needed to work on my English. My parents speak the Southern dialect, so the recordings that accompany this book are a little difficult for me to understand. In any case, the most annoying thing is that the dialogues and examples often use words that were never introduced in the new vocabulary boxes.The Foreign Service Institute offers free recordings and texts for a basic course in Southern Vietnamese, although they are outdated: [...]"
2,Not for beginers,"I speak English, German and a bit of Spanish. I am engaged to marry a Vietnamese woman. I bought this course when we first started dating to try and pick up a few phrases. I found that it is not made for a total beginner. It is a great supplement to the basic Pimsleur course, but do not expect to learn much from this course alone."
2,OK for non-beginners,"I grew up speaking and hearing Vietnamese at home, but I stopped speaking when entering kindergarten to ""avoid having an accent"". After reading this book, I realized that I was able to recall a lot of words. I just don't know how those who have never had any Vietnamese would be able to learn this alone. A native speaker will definitely need to guide the person through."
1,Useless for Beginners,"Unfortunately, I paid good money for this book/audio CD at the bookstore to help my husband learn to speak vietnamese (I speak vietnamese). It was so intense and haphazard - he tried to work through the first few lessons - learned next to nothing. We then did what we should have done first - researched online - and found out that others thought this program was terrible as well."
4,Personal opinion,"As an organist in a Masonic Lodge, I have in interest in what Mozart had composed for use with the Masonic ritual. While the music presented here is of interest, I find that the material presented here would not be used currently."
1,recycled ink for Epson CX3800 printer,"I had high hopes for recycled ink. Unfortunately, this ink was smudgy and washed out on the page. I will not use recycled ink again."
1,Still waiting for the product,"I ordered this product on July 5th 2010. It is now August 6th 2010. I have yet to receive the product. Hence, It's difficult to rate the product's quality and value."
1,Stop Abusing Bernoulli!,"The concepts taught in this book violate known laws of fluid dynamics which have been experimentally validated. There is no problem with describing the generation of lift using Newtonian momentum principles in a global sense, but this does not imply that classical circulation theory is invalid! This book is written with a great deal of misunderstanding of fluid dynamics. Fluids cannot be analyzed as a discrete number of particles which act independently of each other. Due to the continuum nature of fluids, air flow around a wing cannot flow in a ""regenerative"" pattern as proposed in this book. This can be seen experimentally to be impossible by analyzing the velocity field around a wing using a flow visualization technique."
3,Mostly good,"It's overall a good book, I would have given it a 3.5 star if it's an option. The structure is clear with easy wording at entry level, suitable for beginners. However I was a bit disappointed in the lack of maths in 3D modelling and other later parts.Another great drawback is the lack of neutrality of the author - the Newtonian and Kutta explanation of lift could be essentially the same. They are just discribing different stages of the recirculation.So if you want to do a physics coursework on airfoil lift, or just have some nerdy fun, this is definitely a good choice."
1,Flawed Book,Perhaps the worst book relating to aircraft design that I have ever bought. Many flaws. Wish I could get my money back for this one. I'd give it zero stars if I could.
4,Star Trek Broken Bow Hard to find,Item is hard to find but Amazon had it. Received it very quick and in great condition.
1,Totally innacurate book,This writer does not have a clue of what he is talking about. He needs to read scripture.
5,nice,I use this at church. It works very nicely and blends in with all the other instruments on stage.Great price and arrived in a timely manner.
4,Much wider than other Dunhams,"I have been getting 18 4E Dunhams for years, and these shoes are definitely much wider than the all of the others. The shoe is comfortable, but I am concerned that, over time, my foot might start sliding around too much when these get broken in more. It's not a great looking shoe, but if you've got big feet like me and just need some decent comfortable, black shoes and aren't concerned too much about style, then these shoes may be for you."
4,Solid,"I Have had these shoes for a couple of months now. Being an extra wide, the width of these shoes are more than adequate. Build quality seems very solid. I feel like these shoes will only get better as they break in over the next couple of years. My one complaint is that the opening from front to back feels a bit tight/stiff. If you have sensitive ankles, or edema in your legs this could be a problem for you. That being said, I'm very happy with this purchase."
3,tough but stiff,"Bought this after reading so many good reviews. My first Dunham.Like-well built and tough. Leather looks like it will outlast the sole-firm wide sole but not too hard-good insole-wide sizes available-multiple purpose shoe - can use for office, street, parks, grass, gravelDon't like-leather is very stiff, not like Clarks. But my feet feels well protected like a work boot.-not suitable for formal/dress-up, but Ok for business casual - looks a little like a work boot-leather has no shine (unlike the pic) - like a work boot again-feels hot after a day's wear. Leather is not very breathableIf you're looking for a tough shoe with lots of wear for a casual or semi formal occasion, this may suit.But leather is way too stiff for my liking - just reminds me of a work boot.Sole is great for all types of ground."
4,"Own four pairs. Great build, comfortable. Warm, and waterproof","There are lots of great reviews here already so have not much to add except to point out to the people who said the shoe gets hot, it is a waterproof shoe, remember!I wear this shoe daily indoors in an office environment and also walking hills of northern California in all types of weather. It protects my feet nicely as a boot and looks like a nice shoe."
5,"Truly waterproof, comfortable, and more durable than any other shoe I've had","Cost a little more than the shoes I usually buy but worth it. I prefer walking to driving or taking the bus and walk many miles daily. $30 shoes wear out in a matter of months. These last years though, and really are waterproof. They have pretty good grip too, but still need to be really careful on ice. I discovered them when I found them at a thrift store for just a couple of dollars. Even though the thrift-store pair was already well worn, it lasted over a year and since I couldn't find it again in a thrift store, decided a new pair would definitely be worth the price. I think it's been about a year now, and they're still my favorite. If you wear your shoes all day and are active, this shoe is best worn with thick absorbent socks though because no water in means no sweat out either."
5,Comfortable shoes for narrow feet,I have very narrow feet and have had difficulty finding shoes that fit well. These shoes fit very well and are very comfortable for walking.
5,Dunham Waterproof Great,"Originally got Dunham because like other New Balance products it gives me the width I need--4E. I have had several Dunhams. They are hugely sturdy and last a long time. As such they represent ""value for money"" as the Brits say. I wear them with custom orthotics for which they are deep enough and find them very comfortable, not stiff as one reviewer wrote. And the waterproof feature is ideal. I have worn them repeatedly at a muddy dog run and months later cleanedDunham Men's 8000 Waterproof Oxfordthem up with shoe polish. NOTE. Do not add extra water protection like Dubbin. This will plug up the Goretex and they won't breath. Not all Dunhams are waterproof, so look out for this feature. Local shoe stores had limited selection, so I ordered directly from Dunham website which presented their whole lineup. The ordering and delivery process were totally smooth."
3,Be weary of their intended use.,"Length:: 1:24 MinsSo I bought these shoes on May 29, 2011 and the time of this review is April 23, 2012. I read the good reviews about these shoes and I bought them for work, but they ended up collapsing in less than a year. I do very intensive work which has the shoes bending in ways they might not have been designed which has caused one to completely fall apart and the other is not far behind. I will be purchasing a different shoe in the future to replace them since they are pretty much no longer wearable in their current condition.The sole is plastic and it is in the worst condition overall."
2,Dunham shoes,"This would be my third pair of these shoes but the first I bought on line. Since I'd had two other pair of the exact shoe I didn't think this was a problem, as I knew the exact size, 11 2E and my feet hadn't grown....Well they are not the correct size; they are both too short and too narrow. I'd hoped that with wear I'd adjust to them but I'm miserable. I've noticed they have a design change in the tongue that may be the difference but I can't say for sure.I've learned that there are some things best purchased in person...shoes are one of them. I didn't save enough money to have to suffer through these shoes!"
4,Family heirloom Haggadah,"We have been colecting this Haggadah soon after I inherited 5 of them from my parents. The version I own is dated 1923, grey hard cover, pictures and songs. I collect them in order to have one for everyone who attends our seder. I now own 18 and would buy more. The Haggadah is very complete as to directions, songs, games and illustrations. The only thimg missing is the ""Plagues"""
1,BIG dissapointment,"I bought this game as soon as I saw it! Being a huge JP fan, I played it as soon as I got home! And then I cried for 3 hours! The game has horrible graphics, a bad storyline, and a weak fighting system. It really drags JP's good name through the mud!"
3,Terrible packaging,"The cases were what I expected for the price. Slim cases are fragile and as a result poor packaging doesn't help. Out of the 24 cases two had broken hinges and two had scratched covers. I was able to replace the two scratched covers with the covers from those with the broken hinges, making my loss only two out of 24. The the cases were wrapped in plastic and tossed in a box with only some brown paper wrapped around them. Not much protection. Lots of room to move around. I think boxing the cases in a box and then placing that box inside a bigger box with better protection would have been smarter to keep the cases from flopping around during transport."
4,Why Security Tags?,We order two 25-packs of these cases and they are fine--just curiously every single one of them had plastic security tags on it. Why???
2,You Can Always Depend on Ministry of Sound to Produce Garbage Compilations,"I'm not going to waste too many keystrokes critizing this compilation by the infamous MOS because I'd be here all day. I just had to listen to a recent ""Annual"" to see if it has changed gears in the last 10 years. Well they have, and for the worse. The Annual for 2007 sounds like something I would expect to hear on a Clubbers' Anthems compilation.Disc 1 get 1.5/5 stars and disc 2, 2/5 stars."
2,Worst Annual,"I own Annual 04, 05, 06, 07, 08 and 2007 is BY FAR the worst one. it is just so bland and a little too trance-like at times."
4,My Floppy Drive,"Received the item in few days after placing order. Item in excellant condition and works perfectly for my HP Laptop, I am verry pleased with the item."
2,honest but uninspired,"I respect the author for telling his story honestly at least as he saw it, but there is very little that is redeeming about this story; No real sacrifices given for others or for the greater good, a condescending tone about those he disagreed with and childish antics that are sometimes funny but aren't enough to make you care.I think it is especially revealing when he is bemoaning his girlfriend leaving him for another guy but had no qualms visiting numerous prostitutes. His self serving attitude in this area really makes it hard believe he is portraying those he vilifies fairly. It's all about number one."
4,An Infantryman's Life in Nam,"I think it is a good look at a terrible war. Many officers and lifers are exposed as incompetent and uncaring about the lives of the ""grunts""."
4,pretty good,"I enjoyed the book for the most part, although I did not agree with the author's attitude toward his service time, he seemed to be an officer that truly cared for his men and knew what was going on."
1,Save your money!!!,"The author brags of his many ways he tried to beat the system. It is no wonder the war took so long, with people like this author trying to do everything he could not to face the enemy. His girlfriend was the smart one to drop him. I am sorry I spent the money for the book!"
2,nam sense,"did not finish the book. It got too involved in units attached to so and so and it got too confusing to follow. Instead of just telling the story, it was too technical in content."
2,Not that great.,"I really disliked this book. The author had some real attitude problems. His depiction of ""lifers"" vs. ""draftees"" and ""grunts"" vs. ""REMFs"" was downright despicable. Vietnam was often a war without a front. Guys in the so-called rear were attacked by sappers and mortared. Those rear echelon men who flew in slicks were bigger and more obvious targets than any platoon size element on the ground. In the end I was left with a feeling of sadness based on Mr. Wiknik's portrayal of his life in Vietnam. His ghosting and dereliction of duty left me angry that this man just skated by while others gave their all."
5,NAM SENSE,"It brought back the good times and bad that was experienced in da ""Nam""! Arthur Wiknik Jr. tells a compelling story...it worth reading if your a vet or if not, pick it up and try to understand the S*** and Hell he went thru!"
3,so so,it was ok it was from my time era cvould relate easy read would let others read it if they wanted
3,Not So Bad,"An interesting concept. It needed to lose about thirty or forty-five minutes, as I recall. But have a look and you'll instantly have a conversation starter for the next Dutch person you meet. It seems they've all seen it and are rather proud of it. Oh... and the blonde kid? Super, super hot... especially in the shirtless scenes."
4,Cows and Horses by Barbara Wilson,"Was shocked, in leafing through your books, to find that this excellent book had no review. I read it when it first came out many years ago and it still sticks with me as one of the best. It has a wonderful moody northwest ambiance, the characyers were engaging and the story well told. I reserve 5 stars for something extraordinarily literary which is a very rare thing, so 4 stars is usually my top recommendation. Barbara Wilson is great to read."
3,Beautiful but Delicate,"This scratches very easily; the paint, coating or whatever scrapes off and leaves a permanent mark. Honestly, I wouldn't have bought it had I known. That being said, it's very attractive, the paper is good quality and the pages lay flat when you turn them. BTW, don't buy the wisteria version of this journal because the color-quality is very poor and nowhere near as stunning as the colors in the leaded glass. But, this Autumn Vine is right on par with the rich colors of the glass."
5,Lovely book,"This is a gift for my niece, and I'm glad I bought it. It's really gorgeous and very well made."
1,Hindsight shows conspiracy theories were bogus,"When the disaster occurred thirty years ago, at the height of the Cold War, people reacted pretty much true to their existing political biases. Placing the blame for the tragic deaths followed ideological lines. Clubb's book was a 'classic' argument-from-conclusion of this type,amd it was bad scholarship in service to perpetuators of a bad act, the Soviet government. Analysis, and new data, over following years showed the airliner's course deviation was accidental and the Soviet attempts to identify it incompetent, leading to an inexcusable decision to apply deadly force AFTER the flight had departed Soviet airspace, while it was over international waters.A lot of the controversies and investigations are summarized at my site[...]"
1,Not Good,"Since I like the Walden Farms salad dressings, I thought I would try this dip to eat with rice chips. However, when I tried just a little dip on a spoon, I decided not to waste a good rice chip. It had little bits of something in it that I think were supposed to resemble bacon bits. The only thing I felt they did was make the flavor of the dip linger in the mouth a little longer. While I have had worse tasting dips (like the Walden Farms French Onion Dip), I couldn't make myself eat any more than that taste. My advice to others would be to use your money to make a low cal bacon dip. Don't throw your money away like I did."
2,Wheel of Yoga for the experienced & flexible,I bought the Wheel of Yoga DVD based on the good reviews. Was looking for stretches & positions that addressed a bugaboo of cyclists - forward position on the bike leading to forward shoulders in posture. There is nothing on this DVD that addresses this! I was quite surprised & disappointed.
2,Not good,"This video offers some basic stretches (few of which you'd do in a real yoga class). The video is spit into many short segments and the ""view all"" feature doesn't seem to work. So it is a very fragmented experience. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who wants to practice yoga or who wants anything other than very basic 3 to 5 minute stretching exercises."
5,Good for the casual rider,"I'm not a frequent cyclist, but am able to get out for a long ride every few weeks. David's routines are a great way to make sure I'm in shape and limber, and recover well afterwards. Good bonus features, too!"
3,"Egyptians ""black""?????","They ruled Nubia. The Nubians only ruled in Egypt after the 6th century, B.C. At this time they had a viable form of worship with god kings, et al, which made it compatable (copied from Egypt)and a stronger military which easily overcame the corrupted Pharonic system. Those who believe the Egyptians were black have that racist afro-centrism from that once good college CCNY."
5,Posted review misleading.,"I and 5 of my close friends have read and deeply enjoyed Akhunaton, The Terrestial King. The reviewer's comments about the material being shallow and romantic is entirely misleading. The material spans thousands of years and in the telling held our attention throughout. For anyone wishing a fascinating read of mythical proportion I heartily encourage them to read this masterpiece by a brilliant new author. In closing I must suggest that the reviewer did not even read the material or he would not have referred to it as a romance."
4,IT WAS VERY INFORMATIVE.,"This book was very descriptive and informative. I have to say that I saw nothing wrong in their labeling of the ""people of color"" as the person stated below. IT IS A WELL KNOWN FACT...that Egypt was not completely black because of the Near Eastern influnces and migrations of such people. Not to mention those times when Egypt was invaded and controlled by the Assyrians, Persians, and the Hykos. Yes the black people were influential in Egypt,some were pharoahs, great leaders and an important part of the Egyptian population. But not everyone in Egypt was black. There were many dynasties led by those that were not black which can be seen in various paintings and sculptures where there is definately NOT negroid features. Obviously, it is not only the Caucasian race that is excluding well known facts about Egypt. Egypt was a place of mixture."
5,MANY PARTS ARE TRUE,"The author has skillfully blended information from MANY sources into a mystical, mythical novel which very much reflects the subject he seeks to demonstrate. It is not always easy for the spirit world to reflect perfectly into the physical. Akhunaton and Daniel Stewart are stepping out there and doing what they know to do."
3,Shipping Costs Outrageous! Beware.,"This $3 pot holder ended up costing $11. It was part of a larger order, sent from a 'partner' company. Ey, Amazon, I think you guys got a lot of nerve. We want a purchase to be fair. $11! You must be kidding!"
1,i would have liked to have given it zero stars.,"these discs are the worst of any i have used with the sony dru-500 combo dvd burner. i used memorex, verbatim and optodisc with no problems. i tried to contact customer service, but they were of no use, saying that the discs were for general use and not for video - even though their website says that you can use their discs for video. spend a few more cents and get some quality discs. stay away from [khypermedia!!!]"
4,cover 2,"covers the grill well, enduring rain, wind and time....no relation to earth, wind and fire...it's probably been several years since I bought it, but it's still in decent condition.so a good deal."
4,Best Case I Brought,The case holds everything I need it to.The dividers are movable so it fits everything in its place.
4,Outstanding Value,"The bag was deleivered sooner than promised and is better than expected for the price,excellent quality in both build and materials."
4,"Finally, the right bag","Believe it or not, I own 6 bags for the same kit. They all sounded like the best; the backpack, the one with pockets, etc. The problem was that I have three lenses for my dslr and the extra lens require a bit more space than the standard size bag. I didn't want to cart around a bag that weighed 50# but I needed a bag that held all the lenses and was lightweight. This is it. Don't go anywhere else. This bag is intelligently designed with spaces for everything, easy access to extra lenses, pockets for accessories, a comfortable strap. The bright color interior is an added bonus. This is the one."
3,No easy access,"The bag is very well made, which is one of primary reasons that I ordered it. However, with both a zipper and front and side clips all protecting a top opening, there is no quick way to get to the equipment unless you want to use just one clip and hope it doesn't accidentally open. The inside of the bag is very well padded with a number of compartments. A fold-down flap allows the camera to be stored with my 18-55 lens mounted, but the same cannot be said for my telephoto. It's not a question of bag length, but because none of the pads forming the other compartments can fold like the first one. It would be useful if a second flap could also fold down, so that this problem could be avoided.All in all, it's a good product and worth the price."
5,Great Bag! Holds TONS of gear.,"We got a new digital SLR and shopped quite a bit for this bag. I can fit:This camera with a medium lensa telephoto lensthe digital handicam (it is a smaller one)the coolpix little digital 35mm in its casethe old film SLR with a medium lenssecurely in this bag with all the dividers. Plus extra filters, and assorted junk in all the outer pockets....and carry it comfortably.As others have noted the yellow interior really is a help.The only thing I would change is that the 3 latches for the top are a little loose, so if you don't zip the bag when you are wanting easy access, when you lift it by the top handle, it always feels insecure. It really isn't (3 latches work fine with a good overlap top to side for protection), but I wish it didn't scare me everytime I lift it."
3,Not the same inserts as pictured,"This is a great, well built bag. However mine did not come with the same inserts shown on the site. It had one long piece that went across the entire bag longways and then a bunch of short inserts that could go on either side of the center piece. How are you supposed to put a DSLR with lens attached in there properly? Seemed only suitable for holding a bunch of lenses. For this reason, it sat in my closet for a couple of months until I decided to trade it in at a local camera store for a Think Tank shoulder bag."
5,a very nice product,"I was searching the web for quite some time to find the best bag for my new (at the time) 7D camera and tamron 70-300 lens. After checking different products and carefully going through the comments I decided this was the good bag for me. So I ordered it and actually the product is very well build and I loved the quality. It looks durable and the shoulder slip is very nice. So nothing to say. Lot's of pockets very ergonomic. The pockets can be arranged as one likes but it took me some time to find the best setup.It is a little bulky though so I had to buy a smaller bag for short trips when I don't need all my material. But now with the flash and a 50mm prime it is starting to get crouded in it.Overall it is a nice product, we don't see many in our globalized era :(..."
4,4/5,"Fast shipping, fast delivery. The book was in very good condition, but contained highlighting throughout and the hardcover corners were frayed... which did not match the seller's description of the item, but good deal overall. Thanks."
4,Good general reference,"Good text, quite readable and easy to understand. Written by experts in cancer biology at U of WA and Cornell."
1,Slow delivery,"It took them several days to send the book that I ordered. Slow at delivery, so if you really need the items fast, you might want to choose another company."
2,SMELLY!,"Ok, the book itself seems to have been in fine condition. However, I am very confused as to how you can make a book smell, but this one did! It smells like it has been locked in a boys locker room for years! I gag just about every time I use it."
3,Genetics: From Genes to Genomes,"Great figures to go with the text. Not a quick read, but it is a great genetics resource."
2,Genetics: From Genes to Genomes,I found this book extremely verbose and unorganized. It would serve as a great reference book for a lab researcher or grad student. But it's way too technical and dense for an introductory genetics class. The authors do a poor job presenting the material in a comprehensible way to an undergraduate genetics student. Not recommended.
2,Way Too Much...,This book is used in my undergrad genetics class and I don't think it should be. The text is way too difficult to understand and it is also very dense for an intro class. The way sentences are worded on the chapter problems problems are confusing. I often find myself reading the same problem 5 times before attempting to answer it. My professor even had trouble understanding what some of the questions are asking.
3,Good for teenage girls...,"This book about a girl who falls in love with two boys. She was invited to California by her mother's old friend. There her new charming experience started. She also underwent a painful heart broken. However, at last, she must dicide whether she's ready for her true love."
4,Sweet First-times,"I think the whole point if this book is that, things aren't always one-sided. We have to learn to think things by different angles. And that's when you start to learn things, you start to understand how other people feel. Just like Shelley, she's never left her hometown before, so she never knew what was going on the outside world. Before, at her hometown, she thought yellow slickers were awful, but when she leaves for Southern California, slickers were the real fashion everyone was wearing. It was a whole new experience for her, and a good one too"
4,The Luckiest Girl In The World,"The book ""The Luckiest Girl In The World"" was a great book. It was not hard. The way the family had fun together made me feel good.I did not like how the brothers and sisters were so annoying and the way they made life seem so easy. Somebody who is having a hard time with relationships would proubly like this book."
4,The Luckiest Girl,"I really like this book, but there are a few gaps in the story. Another good Beverly Cleary book, though. This was my favorite book when I was younger."
4,not just for girls,"Interestingly enough I was working at a local boys and girls club last summer as a reading room supervisor. I ended up picking this book up one day while bored and actually asked to take it home! I think I read it in like a day! To me it was very well written for a YA book, the character's had a lot of demention, it wasn't totally predictable, and Shelley was a really nostalgic character for me. Even though She wasn't much younger than me, I could relate well to her self discovery, new experiences growing up, and fascination when she moved. I'm sure any 12, 13, 14 year old would feel the same way! Good read :D"
3,A bit too perfect,"Beverly Cleary's greatest talent is not only for first rate and vivid writing, but for portraying situations with which children (or anyone with past experience as same) can identify. This book falls short of the latter promise. Shelly's situation is the sort that most teenaged girls would envy as far off, and ache at heart to see as unattainable. Her first suggestions in a meeting at a new school, for example, are eagerly accepted and set her off on instant popularity.Beverly's usual adeptness with presenting realistic teen romance scenarios is absent as well. A woman of any age would hope to have the gallant fellow here in her stocking for Christmas. Little of the pathos and awkwardness (let alone rejection!) typical of that age comes through."
2,The Luckiest Girl's book wasn't so lucky...........,"When I first read this book I kept thinking, ""Her life seems normal, why would her parents ship her off to California??"" That question kept going in my head because I myself am a mother of one (Haley, 13 months) and even if Haley put roses that were freshly cut in the Disposal, I wouldnt send her to live in another state. I thought that if you havent read this book, its not really worth reading, but I still love Beverly Cleary. By the age of 10, I had read the book Fifteen about 20 times. I really loved Emily's Runaway Imagination. They were all great but this one was not her best."
4,A Good Book,"The Luckiest Girl by Beverly Cleary is a good book. The main character is Shelley Latham, who is sixteen. Shelley lives in Oregon, but her mother's friend from college, Mavis Michie, has sent a letter inviting Shelley to spend the school year in California with the Michies. Shelley goes to California. She feels like she is in fantasyland. Oranges are growing on trees, and flowers are blooming in the winter, and there are palm trees! And now she is going out with Philip, the cute star of the basketball team, and the other girls are all jealous. To find out what happens to Shelley, read this book, which I would reccomend to anyone who likes to read."
5,DHA and cognition,"I take this instead of my ADD medicine and it makes a huge difference. It also seems to reduce impulsiveness with my son, who is high-functioning asperger's. Do some research--try googling DHA cognition .gov and read some academic studies. These have the benefit of being small enough for my son to swallow. DHA is more effective than just straight fish oil."
2,A little disappointing,"This book was a bit disappointing because there really was not a lot of in-depth background information on Honus Wagner the man. Seasons were covered in five pages and, in one instance, the text reviewed one game by stating that Honus had hit, ""a three-run double, but the Pirates lost 5-2."" How can the Pirates lose 5-2 if Honus hit a three-run double? There seemed to be many errors of this nature in the book as the editing was not very crisp.I tried not to be too harsh in my review as I know the material on Honus is not easy to find, but even the material that is available in the text is not presented very well. Honus Wagner was arguably the greatest player of his time and a simple, interesting person off the field, so his story is indeed an important one to baseball fans. Unfortunately, I don't think this biography is the one you want to read if you want a well-written, in-depth portrait of Honus Wagner."
5,great product,"I wasn't disappointed in this product. As I would expect, these Tommy Hilfiger sheets are of great quality at a good price."
4,sheets,I am unable to review the product's use since i bought it as a gift for someone I do not know. But it looks like it would fit the requirement perfectly.
2,not good quality but like the look,I was surprised after reading the reviews that these sheets were not very good quality or texture. They are not soft and still after 3 washes I wouldn't want to sleep on them. My 3 year old doesn't mind them though! Maybe I am spoiled with high-thread count. I do love the color and design.
3,Tear in Sheet,"nice sheets-colors are great, but there was a small tear near the top of the flat sheet. Would of liked to return, but seems like too big of a hassle."
4,Not the best sheets I've ever had,These were purchased for a couple of air beds I got for my two grandchildren to sleep on and they did the job admirably. I think they need about 20 more washings to soften them up some so they don't wrinkle so much.
4,Sheets,OK but picture is different than actual product. I liked the design but did not go with the comforter I had.
5,Another Belkin Winner,"Belkin continues to come out with useful unique devices that it seems like others would think of but don't. This product is an excellent example. The swivel feature allows me to you all eight outlets even with very wide plug housings, just as advertised. It's also nice to have the surge suppression built in, even if it is pretty basic.Belkin Pivot Surge, 8 Outlets, 6ft Cord"
1,Great for one month 'til the insoles wear out!,"These are great for about a month, and then they are useless. I had two pairs for two winters in a row, and neither one made it even half-way through the winter. I only wore them indoors as slippers, and liked the support and comfort. But within a month the insoles wear thin and start coming loose - as your feet sweat they stick to your foot and get wrinkled and messed up in the shoe so that you constantly have to take the shoes off, take out the insoles, and put them back in correctly. It makes them completely useless, and is unforgivable in shoes of this price.I have never had this problem with any of my Uggs, but every Merrell shearling shoe/slipper seems to do this - poor quality and no attention to a fairly important detail is inexcusable for a $90 - 100 shoe. As I said, I do like the support and impact protection, but they seriously need to fix this problem that has been around for at least 3 years!"
4,Useful companion guide.,"This book deals with the principles of interpreting Revelation (hermeneutics). The first eight chapters deal with hermeneutical problems, schools of interpretation, historical background, methods of interpretation, principles of research, structure, history or prophecy, theology of Revelation. The remainder of the book deals with the hermeneutical principles of Revelation including context, theology and figures of speech.The book is well laid out with headings and sub-headings etc. Particularly useful is the list of Old and New Testament allusions in Revelation. Also the list of symbols used and their interpretation, and the numerology of Revelation. There is a lot in the book that will not be found in the standard commentaries.It is of intermediate level and will suite the student approaching Revelation for the first time, or the group study leader."
2,Premillennial literalism,"I didn't find this book very helpful. It's basically a bunch of re-hashed premillennial, literalist ideas. If that's the kind of thing you like then you might find it interesting. I'm not a K.H. Conner fan, but I have two of his books."
2,Not what I expected.,"At first glance I thought that this product would be of great use. This did not turn out to be the case. My wife is Russian and I thought she would get good use out of it while learning English. As it turns out the amount of times the translation was right was a point of contention, and it sits in the box, due to the lack of accuracy in it's ability to accuratly translate. It may be the specific model there are certainly other choices from this company, but not many from other companies. Their computer bases product Prompt! works much better."
2,Russian Translator,"I never did get the hang on how to use this. Could be me, but found it complicated and the Russian girl that stayed with us ( non English speaking) laughed when I used some of the words. Later I learned that not all the words that the translator said were the right ones!"
5,Enjoyment to Last through the night,"I recently saw a special on NJN with James Last. What a thrill. I will certainly say that he is now one of my most preferred. My boyfriend and i were up and actually dancing to every song, be it fast or slow. It made the night incredible. A must have. I do dislike the fact that this is not available on video...truly half the fun."
5,Wonderful Survey: Breathes excitement into U.S. History,"I used this book for self-study after many years away from any formal courses, and I was very pleasantly surprised to find myself engrossed in the lucid and engaging descriptions, the beautiful illustrations and photographs, and helpful index. It covers, at just the right level of detail, American History from the colonization of the Americas to Clinton's presidency. It gives a big picture without being condescending and simplistic, but also without assailing you with inessential jargon and names.I looked at many different American History surveys and this is my favorite by far. On the other hand, if you already know the main outlines of American History, and want detailed analyses of particular periods, then this book will not be as helpful, as it is merely an overview and the bibliography is not very detailed or well annotated."
2,would not purchase if I had seen it in person,"Not a bad piece, but not exactly what I was expecting. Bracelet is very lightweight and charms have somewhat sharp edges. If I had seen it in a retail store, I would not have purchased it."
4,Cute husky and hard to find,"Some of the stiching was starting to come apart when I received it. But a husky this soft and this size is hard to find. The item is very cute and very soft. Very easy to like as well. Out of 100 , I give it an 84 , which is still good."
4,Keeps Pesky Weeds Out,Just roll it out and tack it down and throw your rocks or mulch on top of it.Keeps pesky weeds out. Nice !
2,Learn Mexican Spanish,"The product is good. But the price is outrageous. The regular Spanish course with 5 CDs from the same company is in the retail store about $[...]. This one SINGLE CD Amazon charges $[...]. I expected to receive again 4 - 5 CDs, especially for the price being more than tripple. That is criminal! I am sure there is no plausible explination for it. So far I found maybe 3 or 4 words which are different from the regular Spanish."
3,Rolling File cabinet- Be aware,"This product is a good product, sturdy and well built. However, the hanging file rack that is included is totally inadequate. I had to purchase a replacement for the bottom drawer. Otherwise I would recommend this product."
1,Not worth it,"I found this cabinet to be inadequate in its construction and design. The file drawer doesn't open fully and I have to bend the folders - and risk tearing the files - to get them in and out of the drawer.Further, the construction is shabby."
3,Trolley 3-Drawer Cart,"Product delivered initially was wrong color. Quickly replaced by correct color item. Not bad for the price, however, painted metal sides were badly scratched. One drawer front was gouged and missing a piece of veneer. Sent email asking for replacement parts 3 weeks ago. Have not seen anything yet. But even with these drawbacks, the item is built fairly well and functions well for our purpose. Lots of pieces to assemble, takes 30 to 40 minutes to do so. All in all, at under $100 plus free shipping, its a pretty good deal."
2,Low quality screws,"My grief with this product has to do with the small metal screws needed to put the thing together. The metal these screws are made out of is very low quality, and very soft. I stripped two of these screws by hand, so be extremely careful during the installation (though, I thought I was being careful, and now I've got two stripped screws stuck in awkward places in the cabinet, one of which is making the middle shelf sag. There were no spare screws included, either, so even if I manage to get one out, I've got nothing to fill the spot. The shelves are all supported solely by these screws-made-of-butter, too, which would make me a bit hesitant to put them under a heavy load."
4,"Nice Cabinet, Heavy Assembly Required","I set out assembling this cabinet having a lot of experience and little trouble with similar furniture. This one for some reason gave me a very hard time. Maybe the instructions weren't clear and I was tired, but it is very easy to get it wrong forcing you to have to disassemble and start over. So, read the instructions very carefully and don't presume anything! Just because there's a hole the other side used, don't overlook the instructions based on your assumption.This is a very nice cabinet, but assembling it was a bear for me. It took me four long tedious painstaking hours. The very last thing to do was snap on the back, and that didn't fit quite right and took a lot of work."
4,Complicated but look great,"About as many parts as a battleship, but once assembled they look and work fine. Wish there were more items in this particular line."
4,Not so great for files,"This is great as a rolling drawer unit. And that's pretty much what I bought it for: some drawers for storage, plus a little file storage capacity.The drawers work great. They operate smoothly, without sticking. There're two of them, which is nice for organization. But the filing part leaves a little to be desired. Maybe I'm just doing something wrong, but hanging file folders don't seem to fit in with the folders parallel to the front, like in most filing cabinets. But they do fit in 'sideways'. This might be okay, but then the included supports don't really stay in place, and so trying to go through the folders usually results in some coming loose.The construction seems sturdy (and heavy!), and the casters work well, and it looks great. I didn't have any problem putting it together, either. So, overall, it's great for me. But if you have a lot of stuff to keep organized and filed, it might not work so well for you."
4,Good quality for a good price.,"We needed another file-cabinet and were not looking into spending over two hundred a piece like our previous set of file cabinets (that came with the complete office furtiture); after much research and trying to match the colors, we decided to go ahead with the LEDA cabinet. It took me about an hour to put it together, the directions were fairly simple (parts organization is key); the quality isn't bad, I found some little nicks and scratches, but for this price, I think it's OK, again, compared what we paid for the other higher priced ""premium"" ones. I think the color is actually a little darker as well."
2,Will not purchase this brand again,"This product is not worth the price, difficult to assemble once assembled does not function properly, drawers stick or do not close properly"
5,You Won't Want to Cease Dancing!,"This CD rocks! It opens up for the casual listener the world of international electronic fusion, which is part of the London and world club scenes. The liner notes, as with so many of the Rough Guide CDs, reveals a remarkable subculture of sound which is florishing and which was, until now, wholly unknown to me. The music here is intense, pulsating, electrifying, world-fused, magical, masterpiece-ridden, dance-inducing, swinging, etc. I can't stop playing this one loudly and bopping around my apartment. Don't ask--just buy it and listen. Amazing!"
4,follow the money,"I had been wondering when someone would give us a biograph of Law. After all it is rare in the world that an individual who cut such an outrageous swath through life should have been of some actual significance. Casanova, Nell Gwyn, and Butch Cassidy all cut outrageous swaths, but the world was not altered by their having lived. Law, on the other hand, was the father of the South Sea Bubble, a financial manipulation that affected financial policy in several nations for a century or more. Why only four stars? I like my history straight. Well written, even witty, if possible, but hold the fictionalization. We cannot know, after all, what anyone thought or, usually, what they said. I do like a good story well told, and I like well-told stories about money especially well. For my money, the best such story this season is the unheralded Bullough's Pond. Lots of money, good writing, no fictionalizing."
3,CopyCat,"I had been wondering when someone would give us a biograph of Law.

Lots of money, good writing, no fictionalizing."
1,Save your money,"A very bad novelist attacks history with quite predictable results . This book is the worst sort of modern "" tabloid "" history . Save your money , folks. Law was an interesting fellow , but this writer's "" mind reading / trash fiction "" approach is too much to stomach . Utter nonsense ."
4,French Financial Follies,"This is an incredible story about the rise and fall of John Law and the incredible economic boom and bust he created in France. His economic system was innovative and certainly helped modernize the economy of France, but his greed and that of the rest of the country led to the downfall of the system. The story of France's economy itself was an interesting story, but the story of Law's life is equally interesting. His rise into the upper echelons of society, his troubled times in jail, and life as a gambler is exciting, dashing, and extremely amusing. Janet Gleeson ha sdone incredible research to piece John Law's life together and writes clearly and with vigor so the economic theories and 17th century are understandable and come to life. It is a great book for history or ecnomic buffs and is engaging enough to hold the interest of people who are not particularly interested in the topic before starting the book."
5,A great resource for new and experienced business people !,"Everyday Business Etiquette has the answers to so many questions business people ask. ""What jewelry should I wear to that presentation?"" ""When is a thank you gift in order?"" This helpful book even has answers to questions you may not have thought to ask like ""When's the best time to close a deal in Hong Kong?"" This easy read should be on every business person's shelf!"
4,Turd is rock solid!!,"Just picked this up and was pleasantly surprised. Very heavy guitar sound with minimalist lyrics, somewhat like a raspy Iggy Pop as I could easily see Iggy writing or singing some of these tracks. A great Johnny Knoxville lookin' leader with some powerful vocal chords. Starts right off with ""Turdsville USA"", a super cruncher about smalltown life. They're all good, not a stale fart in the bunch. My personal favorite is ""Riverbreaks"" which contains the classic lyric ""You'll be the Queen of a six foot hole and Turd will be the King of Rock and Roll"". Anthemic, silly, loud? You bet! Beer swillin', ass-kickin'? Oh yeah! Music to headbutt by. Unfortunately, seeing that this is a 1999 release I assume Turd went in the crapper....too bad."
4,HARLY ALL THE WAY,"I thout that the game was prity fun. i am a big biker and at my PC, i don't have to ride, i just sit at my PC and play."
5,Get off the road! Amelia Bedelia is DRIVING!,"Wow! It's a road trip that sets the scene for this absolutely hilarious Amelia Bedelia novel that will keep her fans laughing 'till the last page!Good Drriving, Amelia Bedelia is filled with tons of ""Amelia-isms,"" her constant misinterpretations of the most ordinary things -- most outstandingly ""fork in the road!""The wonderful illustrations bring the story to life. This is most certainly a book not to be missed! It's wonderful."
5,Great,"Benson writes some good thrillers, a little different twist. If something catches my attention and I look for more by the same author I will rate as a 4 or 5, meaning for that genre, not necessarily world class fiction...I like his books"
5,Who done it?,"This was a great mystery/suspense book. It kept me guessing all the way through page after page. Too many suspense books are predictable, this wasn't. Loved it."
5,Very Good Book!!!!,"This was a really suspensful novel! I enjoyed it a lot!Problem:Quoting Arlington reader: ""Are you the freakin author? I find all of these reviews SUSPECT."".NO! Raymond Benson lives in Chicago. And besides, you didn't review the book!"
5,To Be Read Over and Over,"If you have ever teetered on obsessive love, have a passion for the past, or just want an excellent story, read this. You will be so drawn into this unfortunate girl's life. She is certainly ""mad"", and seduced. We have all met a man like she meets, but hope we never descend to her depths of despair over him. Her family gives new meaning to the word disfunctional. I read this over and over and was happy to find a new copy."
1,Sorry,Won't read a book where the author captures her reader's attention with pages and pages of animal abuse. It's a cheap purchase of readership.
4,The madness with in,"An enchanting book about a young woman who comes from a dysfunctional family and then sets off into the world to make a living. When she finds a man, a man she thinks is perfect for her, and discovers she can not have him, it drives her to kill. She shoots another girl and then shoots herself, the other girl does not make it but she does. She is taken to court and declared insane. From there on it is a struggle for her to adapt to a new life."
5,"Awesome, but not what I expected...","I think this is a fabulous workout. It is a refreshing change to have someone who isn't an expert asking questions or making comments. I thought it was fun. The reason I ordered it though was because I thought it was mainly an ab workout, which it isn't. It is more arms than abs, which is ok because I wanted both. The problem for me is that I am injured, and thought this would be a floor video, not primarily standing. I have a torn ACL in one leg, plantar faciitis in the other. So just be aware that this is mostly standing work. If I wasn't in pain, this would be my current HG video. As it is being mostly standing I had to improvise or skip parts. Even with skipping, I am in a dead sweat and had a good time the whole way through. I usually don't care for celebrity videos, but this hits the spot. My arms are still shaking...."
3,Great for beginners. Not a good tape for intermediate and above!,"I enjoyed this workout for the first week. I am not a beginner when it somes to working out. I guess that's why I became bored quickly. If you consider yourself a beginner, then this tape is perfect for you. It has some challenging moves but nothing too difficult. For intermediate and advanced workout buffs, do not buy this video. Even though Kim is cute and charming, the moves just did not produce a lot of sweat or difficulty for me."
4,Kim will kick your ass,Maybe it's because I'm SOOOOO out of shape and I've never done aerobics before...but I just tried this DVD yesterday and I was huffing and puffing throughout the whole thing. The long camera shots on Kim's face are a little annoying...but she's good eye candy nonetheless. I focused more on the trainer than Kim. Kim wasn't in good form most of the time. The exercises DO work--you will feel the burn in your muscles (I feel it in my thighs!) so don't pass on this DVD just because you think Kim is a barbie. This is a good workout DVD.
5,I LOVE KIM AND HER WORKOUT SERIES!,This workout series is great. It's easy to follow and it's fun. Great for increasing muscle tone and improving overall health/fitness. I LOVE KIM!
3,This is kinda hard..,"I actually had a difficult time with this workout. I'm in OK shape, and got this to work on my abs but couldn't do a lot of the exercises because my arms weren't strong enough. This was annoying because I bought this to work on abs, not arms, and I don't want to have to build up my arms just to do ab work. I guess the title is kind of misleading - while there are some ab exercises, it was also just a general workout including arms, legs, etc so if you're just looking for abs I wouldn't recommend this. It is DEFINITELY a good, hard workout though."
1,Not impressed at all,This workout is boring and not at all hard. If you are in fair shape then you will be bored with it. Mine has ended up in the trash!!!!!
3,Great arm exercises,This is great if you want to focus on the arms but i wanted to work on my abs so its not really for me.
3,Not so much an ABS workout,"I got through this entire DVD and felt the focus was more on arms rather than abs - the title was very misleading. While I'm not opposed to having an arm sculpting session - this was not my intention when purchasing the DVD. By the end, I didn't feel like my abs got a workout at all."
3,Decent workout video,"My only problem with this video is the way it was shot. There were too many times where I was trying to see what moves were being done, but the camera was focused on Kim's face. Yes, she is beautiful, but one does not buy a workout video for the shots of the instructor's face. This is the reason I hesitate to buy any of the other videos."
3,Shipped fast!!!,"The shipping was fast and would buy from this company again. The seller gets 5 stars. This video gets 1 to 3 stars. I bought the video because I fell victim to Kim Kardashian, thinking she could actually produce a decent workout video. Kim is in the video but another lady leads the video. Kim is in full out makeup and a cute outfit while another woman works her out. I would not recommend this video for someone who is looking for an easy workout or to lose serious weight. Do yourself a favor and stick to Leslie Sansone or some other fitness professional."
4,Pleasantly surprised,Seriously surprised that I got a great workout with this DVD. I definitely worked p a sweat and have incorporated some of the moves from this dvd into my own exercise routine. My only problem was the trainers inability to keep count and the fact that Kim's outfit is ridiculous.
5,favorite DVD of the three,"This DVD is my favorite out of the three, also the hardest in my opinion. There is no playing around here, so if you like to slack when you work out, you won't get through this workout. It is fun and at the same time challenging. I've had this DVD for about 3 months now, and give or take a few times I didn't work out, this has really helped slim my belly and arms. 5 stars definitely!"
4,Good Workout - Despite Ms. Kardashian,"This is a good workout, despite the presence of Kim Kardashian, who obviously thinks very highly of herself. It's sorta fun to watch her struggle through the exercises while her trainer, Jennifer Galardi, pushes her. Jennifer, by the way, is a master fitness instructor who has starred in several fitness videos of her own (Crunch, Prevention, and 10-Minute Solution DVD's.) Jennifer's sincere sweetness is a perfect foil to Kim's whiny ""celebrity-lite"" attitude. I wish she had been made to keep quiet while Jennifer did all the talking ... but then, Kim's ""starring role"" in these workouts is the reason they're selling. As far as the actual workouts, the combination of abdominal and upper body exercises make it a perfect full-body routine. There's nothing new here, it's just presented in a different and ""interesting"" way."
1,Meh...not impressed...,"I thought the video was a waste of money...for me. I don't think there are enough reps to work each muscle group. I at least was not sore, but that is maybe because I am used to real exercise videos such as P90X. I purchased these videos because wanted to try something new (I love purchasing workout DVD's, and I figured it's Kim, she's gotta put out good quality stuff, right? If you have never lifted weights, then perhaps this video could work for you. I had to pause the video and do more reps.I do recommend her lower body video...my legs and butt were a sore! I just started Brazil butt lift on Monday...you wont be disappointed. I'm def keeping her videos just to switch it up every so often.Best of luck"
2,Not Worth Your Money,"I bought this on impulse. There are 2 main reasons why I dislike the DVD workout:1. It's really not strenuous enough of a workout unless you pause the DVD and do more reps by yourself of each move2. Kim is really annoying. She has a whiny voice, she constantly talks over and interrupts Jennifer Galardi, she makes ""kissy-faces"" at the camera, for lack of a better phrase, and it bugs me that she has her long hair down and gobs of make-up on for this ""workout.""I purchased The Firm: Ultimate Fat-Burning Collection (4-in-1 DVD) and it was 100% better. It's fun and it includes cardio, weight training, sculpting, and stretching. It's way harder of a workout and cost about the same.On a side note, Jennifer Galardi is really good and I would be interested in buying a DVD of hers, separate from Kim.Thanks!"
2,low impact workout,It is ok however i was more focused on a workout using the step more. She has a trainer telling her what to do on the video and has alot of makeup and a corsett. not your workout material to look pretty anyhow i found it a little slow it is what i make of it. trying to stay positive with it i do get a work out and hey i can do it again and again.
3,vida,"Hello everyone,l just watch dvd video for fitness with Abs but l dont have time go to fitness and watch video it same l dont watch much becuase of work full time.ln fact,l want a shape big booty,if l have a car then i can go to fitness best than watch video.there is many equaitment in fittness.l will try and best my fitness for my shape booty look like is kim kardashian and buffy"
2,Don't get this unless you just love Kim,"This was a complete impulse buy for me, one I regretted as soon as I tried the workout. If you are anything other than a beginner, there is no challenge here. Kim keeps saying how hard everything is and acts as if working out is a burden to her. There is a lot of chatter. One positive is an interesting set. Other than that, there are so many good videos out there and this is not one of them! Don't waste your money, you will be disappointed. Also the emphasis in this workout isn't even the abs; therefore the video's title is a misnomer."
4,Great Workout,"All of the negative reviews have been a little harsh on detail of the workout DVD. I personally LOVED it and i definitely see results within the first two weeks, and felt the burn. Very difficult in the beginning, advanced moves. Alot of the moves give the good burn and hurt, but that means it works. It is not only Kim working out she is right beside a certified LA trainer that knows what she's doing. I recommend this DVD 100 percent!"
3,Good reference - not for a beginner,"This book has some great information in it, but the concepts are not explained thoroughly enough for a beginner, especially the later chapters. Furthermore, I found the CD to be pretty much worthless - it gave me the impression that he was just winging it without having thought out his presentation."
2,Review by a professional geologist,"Good luck on finding mineral sites using this guide. While the minerals may be in the areas indicated, the maps are so crude that the likelihood of your finding the sites is very poor. I have tried using the guide for several years with almost no success."
3,Not a masterpiece but it's okay,"This book encompasses a new version of an old theme. In many ways, it has a little bit of everything in it, enough for most readers to sink their eyes into. The main character reveals aspects of ourselves which enables the reader to build a stronger connection to the story. It's not the best book but it gives a worthwhile effort based on what it set out to accomplish. The prose is passable and does not detract from an understanding of what's going on. Thankfully, the author didn't try to overwhelm the reader with ten-dollar words so that you'd need an MIT degree to figure things out. The author does a good job setting up the plot but didn't thoroughly probe into the characters' motivations and psyches. Overall, this book is an interesting read, even if one isn't particularly interested in the underlying subject matter."
3,DVD fine...service stinks!,"The Thomas DVD was as expected, our 2 year old grandson loved it. But the vender left much to be desired. The shipment toke an unacceptable amount of time to arrive, almost 2 weeks. It missed the intended birthday altogether. To boot...the vendor combined 2 shipments into one undersized package but stil charged us two full shipping charges. Made a ""note to self"",never deal with them again!!"
5,A great piece of nostalgia for all those who grew up in NYC,"Will bring back great memories if you grew up in mid century New York! Also great for the grandchildren. A trip back to a different New York, a different time, that is sadly gone."
5,An Exciting First Novel,"In composing his first novel, Patrick Murphy set himself a tricky task - writing from the point of view of a young, sexy, Chicago detective who is also a wife and mother. I'm not sure how female readers would judge how well he met that challenge, but the character he created in Det. Carol Moore sure came across as realistic for me. One reviewer called this novel ""fast-paced."" Good writing and editing helped to achieve this effect. Murphy's story is told powerfully, concisely and vividly. As Public Guardian of Illinois for over 20 years, Murphy has become intimately familiar with the ins and outs of public child care agencies and the abuses sometimes connected with them. This knowledge makes his story ring true. I look forward to his next venture into the world of fiction."
1,Failure to deliver,I never recieved my order. All I received was an email advising this product was no longer available.I was not happy.
3,Good general review of the Spanish uniforms in the latter half of the Peninsular campaign,"While not a detailed review of the many Spanish uniform variations, it does give a good review of the impact of British supply of uniform materials in the re-equipping of the Spanish Army following French capture of most of the Spanish domestic production capability"
1,nudes on the moon,"I bought this movie for a xmas gift just for a joke . A movie from the 60's and the acting is what is the joke. This movie is a classic for bad acting and that all I can say good about nudes on the moon . It would not be right to lead anyone on about this movie "" don't waste YOUR GOOD HARD EARN MONEY ON THIS MOVIE "" .D L Rupert"
5,The kids love it!,"Very clear and understandable instructions, a wide variety of projects and the kids (10 and 12) love it."
3,"Seems good, like many others","I got this for my 11 year old grandson, who was not impressed; he had loved the one on electrical circuits. Maybe the product is excellent in theory, but simply doesn't appeal to young minds -- I don't know."
3,Poor instructions,The instructions included with this set are very poorly written. You are left with a couple of photos to figure out how to assemble any given project. You can figure out how to put together most of the projects but for the more advanced projects it's almost imposable to figure out.
3,OK - lot of extra parts needed,Parts are high quality. Manual could be written a little better - sort of jumps all over the place. Required extra stuff not included in the kit.
5,This Set is Awesome.,IM not Sandra Kubik im her son. this set is not very fragile unless you build it wrong. the bottom will not fall out. the only problem is the wall that covers the ship. it sometimes pops off but is easily reconnected. Overall if you have 100 dollars this set is a must buy.
4,Great Gift,"I purchased this for my 9 year old grandson for Christmas, he was thrilled with it. It came exactly as presented and I'm sure he will have hours of fun putting it together."
3,Disappointing,This was a Christmas present for my 9-year old grandson. He has played with LEGO products since he was a toddler. The Star Destroyer did not stay together after assembled. It fell apart easily and was very frustrating for him. I would not recommend the purchase of this product. It is the only LEGO product with which I have ever been disappointed.
4,overpriced!!,"This set is a pretty neat set. My son loves it! Big news flash for Amazon and it's sellers, though. They are ripping people off!!! It's list price at from Lego is $99.99!!!!! The cheapest price I see listed here is $159.99!! Even Toys R Us only has it at list price!!!"
3,Great design but fragile,"My six year old has become adept at building Lego. The larger the better as far as he's concerned. As far as I'm concerned, the larger it is the more likely it will fall apart when handled. That can be frustrating if you want the Destroyer to stay together but fine if you enjoy rebuilding it - which my son does. Unless you're willing to superglue this bad boy together, you'd better expect that this thing will fall apart on you.Suggestion - Have fun with it."
5,Great Series - Great Value,I bought these having caught a couple of episodes on late night television. The show is hilarious and I was sorely disappointed to discover that this is the show in its entirety. Still this is excellent value.
5,Positively the best TV show at the best price,"This is the best TV show ever created, I am just sorry to say that I never got a chance to watch it while it was actually on the air. However, this is definetly a steal from amazon. For one thing, we checked several stores and noone carried all three seasons. If we would have purchased each season, from several different stores, I estimate that it would have cost us well over $80, plus tax and all that running around. The hardest thing to do was wait for it to get to us; which took about a week. We watched the last two seasons in one weekend -it is really that good. Usually, when I think comedy, I think of some drab situational comedy that doesn't carry its storylines from one show to the next. This one does; multiple viewings will let you catch even more hilarious subtilties. Buy it!"
5,How did this show slip through the cracks?,"One of the cleverest comedies I've seen. Certainly some humor that could raise an eyebrow of the more puritant (which includes me), but the humor is so irreverent I find it hard to take any offense. Where many sitcoms have a few truly funny moments per episode, which they drag out with the live audience laughter, this show is packed full of it and much is so quick and sly that it's hard to catch it all in the first viewing. Each character is so unique and integral to the story. Certainly it will be most appreciated if you start with the first episode and watch as the whole tale unfolds. I don't know where the marketing went wrong, but it was a shame to lose this great cast and this series."
5,Best of the best mini series!,"I was rather reluctant to watch this show, as I had seen an episode on TV and was confused. The trick to this show (and many others these days) is that you really need to watch it from the begining in order to get the whole picture. These new TV series are like book triligies, you can read one by itself but it is best savored as a whole. The acting is fabulous, the charactors outlandish and while the humor is rather raunchy at times, still you can't help loving these zanny guys! My only complaint is that they went alittle overboard with Micheal as the martyr of the family."
5,Something to write home about,"For those of you who know the series, no comment needed. But for those who have seen a random episode or 2, take the time to sit down and watch the series. I have seen about half of the shows when it aired on TV, but even so, its worth watching them again. Hands down one of the best comedies of all time. This is for the audience who enjoyed series like 3rd rock, spin city, news radio, scrubs, etc. Excellent chemistry between the cast, all perfect for their roles. Excellent writing, directing, producing and such, but Ron Howards narration with subtle overtones of sarcasm really makes the show.Buy it. Watch it. You'll be glad you did."
5,Arrested Development - Complete Series,"This show is amazing. The fact that I got the complete series is even better! I couldn't have been happier! If you like sophisticated yet unrefined tongue-in-cheek comedy, this is an excellent purchase. I highly recommend it to anyone. Michael Cera, David Cross, Will Arnett, and Jason Bateman really make the show. Definitely pick this up."
5,Best show ever made.,"The fast past witty humor is amazing in Arrested Development. Sometimes you don't realize things until you have seen the episodes 2-3 times to actually get everything. Its simply the best, Mitch Hurwitz is a genius writer in this show that was hilariously cancelled by fox ops probably the worst mistake in tv history. Arrested Development movie is in the works as of now to continue this comedy legacy hopefully. Good comedy you can always relate to, Arrested Development really provides this I think in its own way."
5,Too bad is over :(,"I never saw this season before I bought this DVD pacj, I read a lot of great comments and I decided I had to buy it, all those awards couldn't be wrong... And I was right, they were not wrong, this TV show is AWESOME!! The writing is amazing, the directing is unique, the characters are hilarious and the story of the crazy Bluth family is great, where can I begin to tell the story? ..... No, you should buy it, give it a chance, and you'll end up loving the Bluth's as I did... Ron Howard really nailed it with this Arrested, he knew where he was gettig into!!"
5,Best TV Show!,The only reason this was cancelled is because a lot of people aren't smart enough to get it. It's genius!
5,One of the funniest TV shows I've seen,"Arrested Development is, frankly, one of the best comedies in recent television history. The characters are quirky and compelling (if not terribly likable), the plot takes hilariously unexpected turns, and the acting is impeccable. If you're over the age of ten, you'll probably be in stitches by the time you finish Disc 1. I highly recommend this product. The worst thing about it is that it's three separate DVD cases rather than one boxed set."
5,I can't help myself,"I bought this with the sole purpose of wrapping it and placing it under the tree for myself. I wrapped it so far ahead of the season that when I came upon it during the ""Santa"" portion of the celebrations, I had sincerely forgotten about it. So, yes, I'm a fan and yes, I've watched it more times than I'm willing to admit. I thought the quality was good and the price was even better. :)"
5,What was Fox thinking?,"I still can't believe that Fox cancelled Arrested Development, which is one of its best shows ever. I could watch these episodes over and over again, which is why I bought this DVD set. Arrested Development jokes often play off of previous episodes, so they're funnier when you watch several in a row.The quirky antics of the Bluth family, combined with the witty, pun-filled writing, make for a show that keeps you laughing the whole way through (even if sometimes you feel a little bad)."
5,One of the Best Sit-com's of our Time,"Words cannot describe how amazing this show is. From the brilliant writing to the hilarious cast. This is a show that is completely underrated. If you have even the slightest interest, you must check it out. You (probably) won't be disappointed."
5,"Intelligent, Hilarious, and Too Short Lived",One of the best shows ever to air in this land of idiocy and short attention spans. Fantastic writing - comedy that just screams modern Shakespeare with double and triple meanings. Manages all kinds of sexual humor without being offensive - a veritable acrobatic show of wordsmithing. Acting is spot on over and over again. One can tell just how much thought was put into each and every episode of this fantastic show. Hopefully whatever moron decided to cancel this show is no longer working in the business. Brilliant shows like this should never end up on the chopping block.
5,"I'm late to the Arrested Development scene, but it's highly worth watching.","I had heard about Arrested Development years ago, back when it was still on air on Fox. I only recall watching a single episode which was good, but not enough to keep me interested in the show. A couple of months ago, I saw the entire series on sale, and decided to go for it after hearing plenty of critical acclaim. I sat down, watched it, and realized what a great show this was. The dialogue is well-written, the characters are varied and interesting, with plenty of growth, and a storyline that keeps moving, but is not overly complicated. I can safely say it's one of my favorite TV series now. I got the complete series for a great deal on Amazon ($27.99), but it's easily worth the price."
5,What were they thinking ???,"Why in the world would they cancel this show?!?! I absolutely love all the different characters - they were all so well developed. I also got a kick out of all the running gags they have (the chicken imitation really gets me going!) throughout the entire show. The DVD captures everything, and its nice to see the show from start to finish without having to wait a week in between episodes."
5,Awesome!,I purchased this as a gift because I love these DVDs! When you buy them all together you save an amasing amount of money! I recommend this item.
5,Arrested Development DVDs,"The Arrrested Development DVDs are GREAT! For anyone who liked the show, you'll love the DVDs. Fun interviews, bloopers and commentaries."
5,funniest show ever made,"Arrested Development is easily the funniest show ever made.Because of the nature of the humor, you may have to watch a few episodes before you really start to enjoy it fully. It's well worth it."
5,Pure genius,"This series has made me laugh louder than anything else I've watched in the past decade. Wry humor galore. I've watched these episodes dozens of times, and see new twists on their running gags each time. This is a hidden gem that ended way too early, much like Wonder Falls and the like."
5,awesome,"I love Arrested Development and to get all 3 seasons for such a cheap price, who could pass it up!"
5,Arrested Development Box Set,"Far and away the funniest sitcome to come out of The States since The Simpsons... Deliciously funny, brilliant acting and every time I watch it I see something new or see someone in a whole new light - usually hilarious but not flattering.Even though every character should be despicable, you can't help loving their self centred, completely oblivious lifestyle.Liza Minelli is an absolute gem and I relished every moment of her return guest appearances.For me this whole series is pure genius and watching it complete indulgance. Makes you laugh outloud, cringe and be forever grateful that I don't live in the Bluth Family bubble. The humour is 'quirky' but never alienating. To everyone involved I say bravo - thank you for taking a chance on something that does not fit the mould.Well worth the investment, you will watch this series time and time again."
5,Arrested Development seasons 1-3,Hilarious! Everyone needs to own this show just so they can appreciate the jokes! There are so many that the more you see the funnier it gets! I love this show and I wish they'd bring it back!!!
5,The Greatest,"Arrested Development is in my opinion the best US sitcom.... well ever. The writing , the characters and above all the actors are all of a level that i have yet to see in any other sitcom. The eccentric family all rounded out by a brilliant straight man performance from Jason Bateman. This show is best watched by buying the DVD sets as the shows storyline continues, so they must be watched in order. A shame that it never found ratings success, however it will surely have a cult following in years to come."
5,Arrested Development,All my friends told me how great this show was but I wanted to wait until the hype died down to watch it for myself. I had seen a couple of random episodes but stopped watching because I felt like I was missing parts of the story. Since the day I bought this set me and my wife can't stop watching it. We just started the third season and I'm convinced this is one of the greatest TV shows ever. Never does it feel like you are forced to laugh; you just do and a lot. This is not a show for people who aren't going to pay attention. You can miss a lot even if you turn away for a second. The characters are played so well and every emotion they portay no matter how absurd seems 100% genuine. The only bad thing about this show is that they aren't making it anymore. You will not regret buying this set but if you're on the fence I suggest watching a couple of consecutive episodes to get a feeling for the story and the characters.
5,sweet,"I was expecting a more cohesive, unified box set. What I got was each individual season's box set, shrink-wrapped together. Not a big deal, especially for the price ($45!!!), but it would have been nice if this was mentioned in the item description."
5,arrested development the complete series,i started watching this show long after the series was canceled. it is my favorite thing now. the writing and acting are perfection. I can't wait for the movie.
5,The best show no longer on television!,"While the DVDs do not offer terribly much in the way of extras and special features, all of the episodes of this classic and hilarious show are reason enough to buy. This incredible series was cut down before its prime, but shines in this DVD collector set."
5,Great Series,One of the funniest and best TV Series I have ever seen. If you haven't had the opportunity to watch it stop what your doing and watch now.
5,Great!,"This is a great series! It's sad the show had to be cancelled, but having them on DVD helps with the grieving!"
5,Hilarious show - too bad it was cancelled,"This was one of the best comedy TV shows that aired IMO. For fans of mockumentaries (Like Christopher Guest's work - Best in Show, etc) and who may have a dry sense of humor. Very well done and hilarious show - once you get through the first disc, you will be hooked until the end."
5,"A ""must see""","AD is one of my favorite television shows, if not my favorite show, of all time. The characters and humor were perfect. I can't believe I didn't watch this show while it was actually on television. The jokes may have been hard for people to appreciate with a week's time in between especially since the hilarity can, at times, be subtle. Overall, this series is something you don't want to miss."
5,One of the funniest TV shows EVER!!,"I rediscovered this series during the Writers' Strike and found is just as funny, if not funnier than when I first saw it on TV! We fans are few but we know just how powerfully funny this show is and always will be!My girlfriend loves it as well!"
2,Love show; very disappointed with DVDs,"I love the actual show but the DVD quality and their ability to play consistently on our computers has been extremely disappointing. Sometimes they play, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they skip, sometimes they don't. Very disappointing even at discounted price. We don't have this problem with other DVDs. I would not recommend this particular set."
5,"Brilliant, but be sure you're up for it!","I wholeheartedly agree with all of the rave reviews, but I would throw in a word of warning if you have never seen the show: for all its brilliance, this is a very particular kind of comedy. It is savage, it is filthy, it is sacrilegious, it is stridently political, and the characters mostly evince hatred and/or pity.I love this show, I think it is the greatest TV program ever to air, but I can also understand why it couldn't pick up the kind of audience that keeps so many stupid sitcoms on the air for years and years. Watching Season 3 on DVD, with its many hilarious anti-Iraq War riffs, I wondered how Fox even let them put the show on the air at all during that jingoistic period of our history.The people who love this show are the ones who see this as a recommendation rather than a warning. If you might be offended by sodomy, drug use, incest, or cheesy magic acts this isn't the show for you. Otherwise, buy it and watch it over and over!"
3,"Show is great, DVD Quality is horrible","So far I am only on Season 1, but I might as well have downloaded the show from torrents, because the video is extremely grainy to the point its distracting. The video quality is horrendous, its almost like they didn't keep original copies of the episodes then found the best available video downloads on the internet and compiled them onto the DVDs. Everything I own is in DVD, and I don't have this problem with anything else.So, the show is great, the quality of the DVD video is TRASH."
5,BEST SERIES EVER,"While this show was very critically acclaimed, the ratings did not reflect it so it was cancelled. The rumors of a movie so far have been unfounded, unfortunately.This is a very smart, hilarious comedy. There is no laugh track so alot of my less intelligent or ADD type of friends have trouble paying attention. You actually have to follow along to the storyline! Lots of very strong, well acclaimed actors, Jason Bateman, Liza Minnelli, Charlize Theron, Jeffrey Tambor, Henry Winkler, Ron Howard, etcPossibly the best comedy ever made!"
5,EXCELLENT!!!,Too Funny!!! They need more seasons. I don't know how they keep it together. Everyone is funny. Especially the blue man group.
5,Far too short of a run...,One of the funniest comedies of all time! I would recommend this series to anyone with a sense of humor...
5,The Truth about Bluth,This show is the funniest I've seen since Barney Miller and Parker Lewis Can't Lose. It's quotable and like The Office bears up under repeated viewings. Immerse yourself in the Bluth family and see if they don't remind you of your own family members!
5,Genius,"I don't use the word ""genius"" lightly and I have never applied it to a TV show but Arrested Development is truly deserving of that description. This is simply one of the most brilliant, witty and hilarious comedies in the history of television. It is therefore no surprise that it was cancelled! I am sorry that I didn't watch this show while it was on TV.Everything, from the mind-blowing writing to the note-perfect acting to the clever direction, is of a standard that one rarely sees. This is also a show that is much more rewarding the second (or third, fourth...) time around. Just buy it. You won't regret it."
5,WHY did they cancel this show!??!,"I never got to watch the show when it was on the air. A friend loaned me the 3-season set and it's nothing short of the funniest, most well-written comedy that's ever been produced for television. I just HAD to buy my own copy!"
2,Two star because it is missing stuff,"This is a great series, but the dvd that i got is missing some advertised features. For example, on the first season bundle, the cover says it has ""Inside look at arrested development,"" Museum's cast panel discussion, original songs by david schwartz, and tv land featurettes. But actually, it does not have any of that. It only has just the shows, blooper reels, and commentary. It is the same for the second and third season. It is missing extra features. I feel cheated by false advertising, so i gave the DVD only a 2 star. Other than that, great show. The two star is for the DVD and not for the show. Everyone here knows how great the show is, so i don't need to rate the show."
1,Amazing TV Show. Horrible Packaging,"I am giving this review 1 stars not because I dislike the show, in fact I love this show, but because the packaging for these DVDs was horrible. The DVDs arrived with all of their cases shattered at different edges. Thankfully the DVDs were fine, but I am going to have to find new cases to keep them in."
3,good gift,"This was a gift for someone and he enjoys it greatly. I love Arrested Development, but watching all three seasons in a row sort of takes the joy out of it."
1,DVD Woes,"I love this show. Really love it. But I am having problems with the DVD's. Other DVD's play fine, but these hiccup, get stuck and, generally, don't work. I feel bad about this. I really wish they would work."
1,Don't Bother,"I'm on the last season and it's a disappointment slogging over the first two episodes. Why all the 5 star ratings?Now I understand why, thankfully, there are only three seasons. Entertaining TV shows would be House, Lost, CSI, 24, The West Wing, Ally McBeal, Heroes and so many others. Funny would be Arthur (Dudley Moore), My Cousin Vinny (Joe Pesci), Trading Places (Eddie Murphy), The Pink Panther (Peter Sellers) or The Three Stooges. Arrested Development is anything but funny or entertaining."
1,Why the hype?!,"I bought season 1 of ""Arrested Development"" because of the rave reviews posted here, and I feel gypped. The characters are complete stereotypes-- unusual stereotypes, admittedly-- but totally cardboard. The level of unpredictable interaction among the characters is virtually nil, and the story lines are silly without being entertaining. I'm amazed that so many reviewers found it so satisfying. Compared to, say, ""Weeds,"" this series has no grip or bite."
5,AD Rocks,"Hilarious, off beat family dysfunction at its mildly subversive best!I love this show and can't wait for the movie."
4,One of the top sitcoms of all time,"The end of this show was an absolute tragedy. Funny, timely, and the best character Bateman has ever played. This is an absolute must own for anyone who appreciates good writing and laughter."
4,Warning!! This is NOT the Complete Series Set,"This is the funniest show ever. You MUST own this. However, this is not the Complete Series boxed set, which is apparently out of print. This is a collection of the three separately purchasable seasons, taped together.Which is cool...just don't expect the boxed set like I did."
5,The Most Layered and Best Show of all Time,"I don't write reviews often, if ever; yet Arrested Development is the best show I've ever seen, and I couldn't not describe my full emotion and gratitude toward the actors and the crew around this amazing piece of work. Arrested Development doesn't require canned laughter or reality show like TV, that is seen throughout television today; no, Arrested Development uses its pure humor and sophisticated, layered, and absurd jokes that is seen throughout the short 3 seasons. Although a bit rushed in the end,it made for the best TV I've ever witnessed. Arrested Development is a show that requires keen to detail and once you really feel the show, you really feel the show."
5,Hilarious!,"Without question, the funniest show EVER put on television. Keeping my fingers crossed that we will be given the gift of a movie to continue the hilarity of the Bluth family."
2,Is one scratched?,"Upon taking the set out of the Shipping box I heard a rattle. A little piece of plastic is rattling around in one of the boxes. Oh ya, and one of the CDs is rattling around. I got this to use as a gift so hardly want to open it to see if the DVD is scratched but also don't want to use as a gift if this is the case. I emailed that I wanted a replacement but have heard nothing. Am disappointed..."
2,Poor Quality DVD's,"I ordered this set in hopes of having a ""commercial quality"" product, DVDs without visible flaws that would stand up to the test of time. What I received instead were DVDs with physical flaws that could only be created during the manufacturing process. This is the first time I've encountered such low quality DVDs for top dollar price. I'm not sure who to blame this on but I would avoid this purchase."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I bought this as a gold box special since all my friends rave about it, and feel it was so unjustly cancelled. I did catch a few episodes of the 2nd or 3rd season when it was on and figured that I didn't understand it because I hadn't been following it from the beginning.Well, I'm almost done the entire first season already, and I still don't get it. It's not very funny, just absurd."
3,"Amazing Show, Not-So-Amazing DVD Quality","Arrested Development is probably, in my opinion, one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. That being said, Disc 2 of Season 2 came in to me scratched, and so I couldn't watch all of that disc. I was very disappointed, especially since I bought it from Amazon.com brand new."
2,When did David Bazan get so boring?,"Time was, you could throw on a Pedro album and be greeted with the honesty, heartfelt sincerity, and unassuming charm of the young David Bazan. Now after years of touring, Winners Never Quit, Control, Achilles Heal and the Headphones album, he just sounds like a bitter old man. ""Fewer Moving Parts"" might be the worst one yet -- for crying out loud, track 3 is about his choice to pursue a ""solo"" career! Dude, no one wants to hear about that stuff, no matter how facetiously you present it. Somewhere, somehow, Bazan turned into a crochety, unpleasant grandpa writing cold, distant, heavyhanded songs that overly generalize their subjects and condescend to the listener. He needs to somehow summon whatever weird ghost inspired him to write songs in the past place and get some of the old inspiration back. If he can.Two stars for a sentimental favorite, I guess."
2,Not Durable,"This looked like a great thing but it's not durable enough for kids to play with. THe signs fall off easily and the stands are so poorly done. If you plan on bringing these outside, you'll be disapointed. They fall off, knock over, and come apart. Don't waste your money on this."
1,POOR QUALITY,"These signs are very flimsy. The signs pop off with even the slightest breeze. Also, they topple over because there is no weight in the bottom. They actually caused a great deal of aggravation!"
3,A little disappointed,"We were a little disappointed when we put these signs together. The poles themselves seem sturdy enough, but the signs hang by small clamps, and slip down and off quite easily. Also, the signs are quite thin and flimsy. Not the quality I expected."
4,cool signs,we bought these as an inside toy to have around the house for my sons train themed party which was a big hit and now we use them for fun with either push cars or our ride ons outside or in the playroom. the base falls off easly when picked up but theyre strdy and cute when in use.
1,Sorry I bought these,"I have 3 boys, and these signs were a gift for them for Christmas. They are not sturdy. Each sign is in pieces, one sign, 2 little parts to hold them on, 2 poles, 1 piece to hold the poles together, and 2 pieces for the base. The signs are now scattered around my house. Pieces are missing, and the poles have become weapons. I thought they would be much sturdier and in maybe 2 parts, but.....I was mistaken. I do not recommend this product!"
3,Okay for Philip K,"About half-way through the stories right now. The stories are just okay for PKD, but better than your average writer. Enjoyed earlier collections more."
3,I didn't like,I've got other Rough Guides to World Music that I like better - only because I prefer African & South American and generally don't like eastern music.
5,A unique and fun CD!,"Out of all the Shinohara Tomoe music I have, the songs on this CD are probably my favorite group (Well, besides Ultra Relax...). Shinohara's music is different and very fun, and the stuff on this CD ranges from slow and sweet to completely off the wall and goofy. Shinohara Tomoe has tons of style and is the most unique and original Jpop artist I have ever heard. This album showcases some of her best."
3,"Interesting, but not what I hoped for","Tomoe Shinohara is a very accomplished entertainer and performer in Japan. She has a number of hit songs that are easily found on U-Tube. Unfortunately, none of those songs are on this CD. :^(The music here is interesting, experimental, but not 4 or 5 star material in my opinion. Perhaps this was the beginning of her career. Heck - Pink Floyd made a bunch of garbage in their first few years, then got into an artistic groove and - well the rest is history. Probably need to order from a Japanese language catalog to get the more popular hits from this artist -- unfortunately I don't speak or read Japanese well enough to find it."
1,Poor Description... Read On,"Hello everyone, this particular item is an add on kit for the Skyjacker YJ40 lift kit. It'll include everything needed to complete your lift, for example: U bolts, poly leaf spring bushings, etc. In other words everything Skyjacker left out of the kit. Summits sells for 122 fyi. Cheers-"
5,Comp Kit Box?,"The picture and title are both a little confusing is this a 4"" lift kit for a Jeep YJ? What does the kit include? The kit pictured does not look like a YJ kit just a generic photo for all lift kits. The words Comp Kit Box is not a typical name for a lift kit. I am interested in purchasing the product but I'm not sure what I will receive."
4,Not realistic but definitely entertaining,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. While it doesn't necessarily create a realistic view of sniper strategy nor of the Vietnam war, it has unique psychological aspects that I found intriguing. Surprisingly complex view of personal attachment woven between a stylized interpretation of marine culture."
5,Introduction to Aerodynamics,"This book is one of the few books on this subject at all, dealing with aerodinamics on this specific level in that way, as it should be done. Time has come to stop bad teaching as it is done in most of todays books on the market.Student pilots and the rest of the comunity deserve to learn the truth on the laws of nature.Mr. Craig, well done.Gigafriend"
4,Good Introductory Textbook,The book provides a great foundation in aerodynamics principles and theory for aeronautical engineers. The book is well organized and well written with clear and easy to follow explanations.I recommend every aerodynamicist to keep a copy in your library for reference purposes.
5,champagne opener,Tried this opener at my father's house during a party and knew I had to get one. His was twice the price as listed in Amazon. It is so easy to use and there is no flying cork or over spill of any of the sparkling wine or champagne. It is a great product!
4,Exhausting!,"An exhaustive and well planned study of keyboard harmony. There's a lot to learn here and I'll never remember it all, but you can't say he didn't put it out there for you."
2,Sad deviation for Nero Wolfe,"Proof that even the best writers don't write winners every time. I have read all of the Rex Stout works that remain in print, and this was the first time that I had to force myself to complete one. As was noted in another review, this seemed to be an experiment that didn't quite work. Kind of like a great French chef trying his hand at a complex Indian curry or Mexican mole. Mr. Stout was best when he stuck with his tried and true voice and characters, Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin."
3,What you pay is what you get,"... I was happy about its small size and nice LCD, but disappointed with its poor picture quality. Not only indoor shot but also outdoor shot was very poor - very grainy, and poor color reproduction. I was expecting very sharp and clear image but it was not. Hence I returned this to amazon. If you do not care about the image and color, then you can go for this. If not, search more and make a wise decision."
2,"""Dew"" problem","I was very happy with this camera ... for the first 12 months. After the warranty time had ended - ""DEW"" happened. It has been having ""dew"" problems do to some moisture, so I were taking the tape out and letting it dry out. Now it has completely stopped accepting tapes, no matter how long I ""let it dry out"".I am very unhappy and will not buy another Sharp product again."
4,Good video and fair snapshots 4.5 stars,"I just returned from a trip to Nepal and India and found the VLZ3U to be just the ticket. It takes great video of a quality that enabled me to extract pictures of Everest and a tiger in the wild equal to most digital still cameras. The still pictures taken with the camera to the card were great for snapshots but are of too low a quality to alow much of a blow up. I did, however, take over 1500 picture that are just fine if I don't try to make them much bigger than 5x6. The ""DEW"" problem has cropped up 3 times in two months with no cause that I could determine as the humidity was not high at any point. I did find that I could remove the ""DEW"" hangup by removing the battery and immediately replacing. When I did this the ""DEW"" disappeared and I was able to take both still and video."
1,Avoid Sharp DigiCams! Production DISCONTINUED/DEW problems,"I am appalled that others have experienced the horrible DEW problem with this camera. When the temperature and humidity changes, the digicam provides a warning and shuts down. This is outlined in the user manual, but I was very disappointed that the camera would shut down for days on end. We missed great moments of our toddler and family events because of this camera, which was a fairly expensive purchase.Upon calling 1800-BE SHARP, their customer service line, I was informed that Sharp no longer produces these digicams anyways!! Since the warranty had expired, the only service centre they could recommend is in Los Angeles whereas we live in Northern California. Our solution is to buy another, much better, non-Sharp product.Avoid this product if you want a satisfactory/happy filming experience"
2,two duds,"Well, I have been very unhappy with this camera. We bought ours a little over a year ago, and had to return the first one because the memory card would not work. Amazon was very happy to replace it, and we had great customer service there. Now, our second one is not working. It has been having ""dew"" problems do to some moisture or something, so we were taking the tape out and letting it dry out. Now it has completely stopped accepting tapes, no matter how long we ""let it dry out"". I called Sharp and was not happy with their answer--send it off to TX for repairs....on your own dime.When I spend $300-$400 on something, I expect it to last longer than a year! We are very unhappy and will not buy another Sharp product again."
4,"good camera, good price","I bought this camera for my husband for Xmas at an excellent price, and have to say I am very happy with it. Although the picture is grainy in low light, it is clear enough to capture the moment. We are not professionals, and this camcorder is great for filming home movies."
2,complaint,I ordered a steering stabilizer for my 87 Suzuki and received a steering stabilizer without screwed brackets as indicated by the photo. Threaded rods were only.
2,Product was not as shown on box,"I ordered a steering stabilizer for my 88 Suzuki and on two separate occasion had to return the item because what was in the box was what appears to be a steering stabilizer that would go with a kit, I just needed the stabilizer. Needless to say I was not happy paying for shipping the incorrect product back."
4,"Oh, Lynn","I loved Lynn Kurland story in this book, couldn't get into the other stores much, but that could have just been me as I'm into time travel and Scottish historical right now. Romance for me has to have more then boy meets girl, boy looses girl, boy gets girl or vis versa. An adventure, or a myster...those who like the other author's in this group will more then likely like there stories."
5,A cat-lovers delight!,"I bought this book at a local boutique bookstore after leafing through the beautiful photographs. Silvester captures the essence of the cats' personalities and style. As anyone who has tried to photograph their own pet knows, it's not easy -- they don't always look as cute on the photo as they do in person. But in this book, each photo is a joy to look at, and in each one you are reminded what it is about cats we love so much. This is a thick book, filled with full-page color photographs, and very little text - only an eloquent forward written by the author / photographer. An excellent coffee table book. I'm planning to buy a copy for each of my cat-loving friends as Christmas presents, and was so happy to see it available at Amazon.Com at a substantial discount compared to what I paid. If you love cats, you'll love this book."
5,Works so easily,This is an HP product and works well in an HP LaserJet printer. I had no problems setting it up and assigning a static IP address. It works flawlessly and that is how I knew it would work.
1,Don't buy the 615... serious problems,"The 615s are garbage. If you were lucky and your card died before 2008, HP replaced it with a 620. If not, you got the privilege of buying a new 620...These cards have serious problems and were not soldered correctly. They will eventually start to do weird things and you will end up replacing it. Save your cash and your sanity."
2,Worked for about 8 months then it died,I bought this to replace a jet direct card in an HP 4200n printer that I had for years. I was expecting that it would last a little longer than 8 months. I guess I'll have to go back to an external print server. I haven't contacted the seller but plan to. I'll keep you posted.**** update ****I sent an email to the seller 'YOUT' and they ignored me. Is it aweful when sellers do not care about customers who they sell pieces of junk to and then ignore their emails when there is a problem.How RUDE to not even respond either way to my email. LOOK AT THERE PHONE NUMBER UNDER CONTACT SELLER: 973-0000000Yeah -- all zeroes -- YOUT really loves to hear from their customers -- NOT.DONE WITH Yout seller.
5,Super!!!!!!!!!,This video is real cool!!I love the way she sings and the guitars are so great!!Excellent and uplifting for Cranberry fans and provides a new horizon for non-fans. I watch it over and over again!
4,Good for the music... Little else.,"Worth buying for this price, lots of good tracks from their first 2 albums. Video quality is fairly poor, looks like a mediocre VHS release. It likely is, just made from the VHS tape released a long time ago. Special features are almost nonexistent. A photo album and the jukebox are it, no interviews or behind the scenes."
4,As described.,The bird stand is exactly as described. It is pretty steady. I put a towel underneath it to help keep it steady.
2,"Great idea, poor quality","The Good: the coating on the perch seems durable and easy to remove for cleaning. My conure seems to like it.The Bad: 1) The welds on the base are crooked, making the stand wobbly (I jammed paper under two corners to stabilize it. The poor weld job and light coat of paint make the stand look like a rushed job. 2) The height adjustment nut is not as shown in the photo on Amazon. It's a simple wingnut. Not that the wingnut itself is bad, its just mis-represented. 3) The height adjustment wingnut came crossthreaded out of the box...I had to use pliers to loosen it, and it won't thread fully into the so the adjustment, and 4) the perch itself isn't mounted with wingnuts as shown in the photo. Instead, phillips-head screws are used.Overall rating: 1 for the very poor quality. I'd give it a zero if my conure didn't like it. Don't buy it."
1,Not a great read...,"I agree with the previous reviewer. I really wanted to like this book, but the writing style was really quite juvenile. The details semed like they were added as an afterthought. An example of the sound (not taken from the book) ""The crumpled paper scraped against her hand as she set down her Starbuck's coffee on the stained oak table, next to the glittering fishbowl that contained a solitary orange fish."" WOW! I wish I had the book on hand so I could write some of them in here! I actually underlined a bunch!"

Skilled quilt designer Debbie Field offers needlecraft enthusiasts full-sized patterns and instructions for quilts, wall hangings, appliqued wildlife blocks, enhanced simple illustrated instructions. Indeed, more than 140 full color photographs enhance this fun and useful supplemental specialty resource which is especially recommended to the attention of the more adventurous quilter!"
3,review of Physics by Giancoli,I found this text book to be hard to understand. This textbook was not a source of learning Physics for me in this course.
2,Horrid Physics book,"I had to use this book for my Physics 1 class... it was a nightmare. Convoluted, confusing and almost impossible to read and comprehend on your own if you didn't already know the topic. In addition I had the student solution guide which was full of the wrong answers to many of the problems. The verbiage used and some of the typos in this book made using it as a student... a nightmare. I'm taking Physics 2 at a different school and we are using ""Physics"" by Cutnell & Johnson which is a fantastic book. It has been so much easier to read and understand on my own. Please teachers - stop with the Giancoli... it's awful."
1,"Damaged quality, and would not accept book back","The textbook I purchased was described as ""in good condition."" However, there was damage to the binding and many other cosmetic scars when it arrived. Since the class was simple enough, I shelved the book and never cracked it open. When I tried to trade it back to Amazon, however, they deemed the book ""unacceptable"" because of binding wear.How can they sell me a ""good"" textbook, and then call it ""unacceptable"" when I return the item in the exact same condition?If you buy textbooks on Amazon, do not expect to get any money back. My recommendation is to rent textbooks on Chegg.com."
3,Physics,"This item came promptly, but it was said in the description that there were no markings on the page, yet there are markings everywhere."
5,A Required Text at a More Reasonable Cost,This is an international version of a US text. There are no discernable differences in the content. Being a paperbound is a plus when it comes to lugging books around in a backpack. Service was excellent and prompt.
1,Totally Misled of the Quality of the book,"I received the Physics textbook which was listed as good-very good, but all of the corners have the cover torn off and the cardboard is flared out, plus the first 10-15 pages and cover have water damage. In addition, I have pictures of the package the book was shipped in and it shows that upper right and lower left corners were exposed and protruding out of the box. I feel very mislead and taken advantage of in this situation. This condition should have been listed as poor, not good-very good and I would not have paid more than $25 for the book versus the $86 that I was charged. There is no way it is re-sellable."
2,Not recommended as a college-level text,"I have used this book extensively for the past two years in my trig-based physics classes. The problems frequently force the student to make assumptions that simply aren't reasonable and the book glosses over content that really should be covered in greater detail. I know this is typical of many physics texts, however, when your book dedicates all of one paragraph to adiabatic changes of state you might want to reconsider it as your text."
2,Not for beginning physics students,"This book has some great diagrams and a lot of interesting problems, but learning from this book is very difficult.The text is lacking: A lot of things are missing that would really help students understand some of the more difficult concepts. I like the Walker text much better. Walker also has a lot of great diagrams, but the text is much easier to follow. Walker seems to intuitively know what you are unsure of and answers the questions in the text before you have to ask them."
2,Frustrating book because of different teaching style,I used this book for a college course in physics and found it very frustrating. The book has good intentions of not showing you how to solve everything to try and get you to apply physics yourself and not just use some memorized formulas. However the book falls short in that it doesn't provide a foundation of how to go about solving problems when you're not sure what equations to use. As someone who took a prior physics course I found this book very disappointing with their approach of throwing you in the water and seeing if you can swim. If you plan to learn physics effectively I would plan on buying another physics book to supplement this one to answer the physics questions this book doesn't.
3,Used AP Physics Book,"I would have appreciated it if the seller would have been more honest about the condition of the book. Yes the pages were intact but the cover was about to fall off. The book was listed in good condition, I would say it is was over priced for the condition that I received it in, it was in ""fair"" condition at best. I would have sent it back but because my child had to start her college course, I didn't have time to do that. I will say this, the seller did send it out quickly and I received it much sooner than I expected. The seller had no other reviews when I purchased this book so I would only recommend they evalutate the condition better. I would most likely give them a second chance."
3,Physics Principles Book,"Book was in worse condition than stated. I didn't expect writing/doodling in nearly every page of the book. But I really needed the book and did not care too much on how it looked. But I was surprised as to how bad it looked. Other than that, book isn't missing any pages, so it's OK."
5,review on physics book purchase,"I bought this book in the ""used"" category and when I received the book, it looks more like new. the only reason i believed it was considered used was because there was a 4 inch scratch on the side of the cover. very satisfied with purchase."
1,Be wary!,"Well after I ordered the book, I have still yet to receive the item. I tried to contact her several times and never heard a word back from her. I eventually had to file a claim to get my money back. Be wary if you decide to buy from this person."
1,Never received my book BUT got a full refund,"I never received my book. It was supposedly sent in the mail but it never came. Three weeks after it was ""shipped"" I asked for a refund and Mr. Bond gave it to me immediately which was very nice."
5,unbelieveable,i bought this album because i am a big bush fan and i wanted the remix and i was very pleasantly surprised. it is like one long piece of music and its so much better than anything i've ever heard before. order it asap!
4,A Very Odd Concept But Magnificent Read,"What The Mailman is really about is how easy it is for people to be held hostage by the powers that be. The things the mailman does in this book would be even easier to do these days with everything on computers.The story begins when the Willis, Arizona's local mailman commits suicide. The town is in mourning and ripe for the picking. The new mailman starts delivering only good mail, no bills or junk mail. This is good except then the power goes out and other strange things happen leading English teacher, Doug Albin to suspect the new mailman. But when he goes to the police they think he is crazy. Then, stranger things start happening, more murders. Now, Doug is convinced that the mailman is involved since everything leads back to him.The book picks up pace culminating with a farfetched and a kind of stretching it ending. All and all The Mailman pulls no punches and is full of the blood, gore and scares that should be in all horror."
1,Did I read the same book as everyone else?!?,"This story might make an okay episode of ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?, but stretched out to book length it's just ludicrous. The local cops won't do anything...so why doesn't someone go higher up the ladder? Screwing with the mail is a FEDERAL offense, after all! But then, none of the characters act realistically. Everyone knows the mailman is doing bad things, but no one even considers taking a ballbat to his knees? C'mon! This has to be the most laughable story I've ever read, the PLAN 9 of horror novels, and Little's writing style leaves a LOT to be desired"
1,Horrible!,"How can people read the works of Bentley Little?? I heard all the great reviews and thought I would check the Mailman out. Boy am I sorry I spent that [money].Little's work reads like something out of Reader's Digest. Hackneyed, dull, and flavorless, Little's writing would not be out of place in an old folks home.And what was the point of this book? Ridiculous. And this is called horror? What is frightening about a Mailman? A lot of trees have sacrificed their lives in an effort to expand the human consciousness. Sadly, the ones who sacrificed themselves for this book died in vain."
2,Good story. Let down ending.,Sorry : - (Up till the end this is a good story. My only question is Mr. Little what happend to the ending ? It just droped out. It left me with ( OK now what).
4,"I knew that postal employees have been scary,but...","This is contemporary horror at its finest.Bentley Little has a way of taking the most ordinary and commonplace thing,the mailman and his mail,and turns them into things to be feared.That's the way he scares his readers-by turning the commonplace into the terrifying.I have been recommending Bentley Little to fellow horror readers,just as I am suggesting this book to you.Read it with the lights on...and make sure you don't collect your mail alone!!!"
4,"Weird, but entertaining","I enjoy Little's work, although his endings usually fall short. This book was rather entertaining, although in the second half, the residents of the town seemed too gullible for the story. Still, it's worth reading for the cost of a used paperback."
3,"Not the Best, but a Little above the rest","This isn't my favorite Bentley Little book but then again it's hard to figure out which is so far. I'm one of those fans who have read four or five books and am still needing a ""Little"" fix. There are times in this book when the characters don't seem to have a solid characterization and so they appear to act stupidly or in ways that don't make sense. The whole purpose of this book though, I think, is to give you a nightmare version of the ""Americana image"" and he does this. The best horror writers put the unreal in your reality and the nightmares in your waking hours and make you believe that it could happen. Unreal enough to be entertaining and believable enought to be scary. Now I'm ready to start Little's, The Summoning!"
2,Quite possibly the silliest horror story I've ever read.,"A small Arizona town is torn apart by the arrival of a new mailman. Sound ridiculous? Something must have made me pick this book up - the rave reviews, the fact that I have really liked Little's short fiction - but now I can't help but wonder what I was thinking. This book reads like one of King's weaker, goofier short stories (think ""The Lawnmower Man"" or ""The Mangler""), except it's long...*too* long. People receive threatening letters, incriminating photos, but do they do anything about it? No, they just moan about that darn mailman for 250 pages (the half of the population that is actually smart enough to realize what's going on, that is.) There isn't even any logic or motive to the things the mailman does, and Little fails to, ah, deliver a satisfying conclusion.This book isn't scary; it's laughable."
4,CREEPY!!!,"This book was Very Very Weird. I really didn't get the plot, but it gave me the creeps; which is most important.I could actually picture each chapter in my mind because the description is so vivid. Little does a good job of describing."
1,No Suspense,"I read The Walking by this author and thought it was wonderful so decided to pick up a few more of his novels. Boy, was this one a let down. Absolutey no suspense and the characters act so moronic!He really could have done something with this book because he's right in the fact that the mailman and communications really make an impact on everyones life but he left a lot of questions unanswered, like what kind of creature would do something like this?And when the story was told from the child's point of view it was like reading from a very educated adults point of view -- very lame.I'm not done with this author yet though. I think the author has a lot of potential."
4,Satisfied w/ Atlantis 100,Purchased this watch hoping for something comfortable/durable to wear to the golf course. With ten rounds under my belt so far the watch has performed as I hoped. Very light weight and comfortable. Easy to clean sunscreen off the watch after the round. Very satisfied.
5,It Takes a Lickin',"I go through watches like crazy; its my work I have my hands in all kinds of things. I like my watch to go where I go, if it can't stand the test then I can't stand the watch. The watch that ""takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'"" is still the best in my opinion."
3,Coulda been a contendah,"There are a number of good to great things about this watch: Veryaccurate, light weight but sturdy, comfortable to wear, easy to readdisplay.So why not a five?If this watch had a recessed crystal which was scratch resistant,it would rate a five.Given that I wear the watch for sport/work, a couple of scratchesis not a deal breaker, but it does bug me a little bit.I would have preferred to pay a little more, and got a product betterdesigned to resist damage."
2,Not readable in daylight,"The watch is thin and has all the bells and whistles, however, it is hard to read even in daylight and the day and date is partially hidden by the faceplate. Would not recommend this to anybody who wants to read the time in the daytime."
2,keeps resetting time by itself!,"This is my 4th or 5th time I've bought this model over last decade or so. The last two recently - quality wise has not been as good as before, so I have to give it a 2 stars from what was a 5 star.If it keeps resetting date/time by itself, I'll start looking for another manufacturer/model."
1,T77511 vs. T77517?,"Bought this T77511 in May 2010 from Amazon.com. Over the year and a half I have had it two-thirds of the black plastic rim (the bezel), including the button guides, has dropped off in two pieces in mild, daily use. The buttons are still attached and work but are askew and must be moved into the right alignment to function.Bought a T77517 in Aug 2007, lost it off my wrist in the yard in May 2010. Found it in the yard again in fall 2010, still working, rain and all, and I still use it when I work in the yard. That rim is still intact; it is not black but grey.I do not know if the bezel has been cheapened in all the Atlantis 100's or if there is a difference in the resin in the bezel of the T77511 and T77517. Others with experience either way please comment."
2,Looks like a woman's watch,"I literally thought I ordered the wrong watch when I opened the box - the watch looks much smaller than the claimed dimensions would have you believe. It feels a bit thin and unsubstantial compared to my old Ironman (which could be a positive if you want light weight). For my purposes, it disappoints on a fashion level and on a practical level (readability during sports), I'll be returning and getting something larger.Love the easy Amazon returns."
4,Long lasting watch with short lasting rubber band,"I didn't purchase this watch from Amazon but some other retailer (remember paying around $40 for it at the time) back when I was in college to aid in time-motion study for a part-time work as an engineer. Since then I've gone thru 3 rubber bands and a battery change until I finally graduated to automatic watches with steel bracelet. Something about my sweat being salty I once heard replacing the rubber band, I was so surprised that these rubber bands didn't last more than a summer (tho they are fairly cheap to replace)... Last time I simply replaced the watch with nylon band and left it in the drawer and the darn thing is still keeping the time after 12 years. If your sweat is on the salty side, prepare to go thru several bands unless you change it to something other than rubber, watch itself is a piece made to last."
5,Works great,"Finally found this watch again, Sweet!This watch lasted me through 4 years of the Army. From BCT to the end and never had a problem.For as inexpensive as it is I can say that it is more durable than you would think.I wore it facing inward (face on forearm) and never had a problem reading it, even after dragging it over concrete, rocks, etc. If you are worried about scratching the face then why are you buying this price-point of watch?"
5,Great Product,"This bag was way better than expected! Lots of room for many items glasses,gloves,masks,tools,etc, LOVE IT! You could even put three 20 0z,bottles of soda laying on there sides in this thing,Its an awesome bag for hanging under your headlight,,,,PERFECT"
2,Get moldy on the outside,These pots mold quickly around the outside of the pot and the mold stays put even after the soil dries completely between waterings. And they dry out very fast. Additionally the same seeds started in these pots as compared to reusable plastic ones seem stunted. The seedlings in the plastic pots were ready to transplant more than a week (in some cases more than 2 weeks) sooner than these. And the slugs absolutely love to hang out around the bottom of these and chow down on the seedlings when you aren't watching.
2,Nothing original here,"I bought this book and as I read it, everything seemed so familiar, maybe because it was just a rehash of The Menopause Diet by Dr Larrian Gillespie. Very disappointing. Too bad she felt the need to copy another book."
4,Icelandic is awesome,"This is a very good way to start off learning Icelandic. I bought this randomly, and not for a real general purpose, but I have quickly become a fan of this device, and language. In the start mode of the program though it doesnt fully explain what to do and how to get there, its basically trial-and-error process for YOU. But it's very fun and DOES Indeed build your vocabulary... I'm not even a child, and I'd reccommend this for ALL AGES. There's games, ""quizzes"", and you can record yourself speaking Icelandic (oh how precious) YOU'LL HAVE A BLAST LEARNING THESE WORDS!!"
3,JVC Ear Gem Earbuds,"I find the ""Ear Gem"" a little heavy. I much prefer the Phillips Earhook headphones # SHS3200 which are light and comfortable and actually fit in my ear unlike other earbud types."
5,number one,all scarlatti stuff is great ... hard to understand how far backward the musical world has wandered ...oh did I mention there are two scarlattis...michael...
1,Not a good toy,"My son received this toy as a gift. It breaks apart too easily after assembly. The gears worked for about a day with little use. I took it apart to try to fix it. The gears are made of cheap plastic. The gear teeth had created a lot of plastic dust inside. I cleaned it out and reassembled it. It worked for about 1 minute before the gears stopped working again. If I could give this toy a 0 I would. Even if the gears worked, it falls apart way too easily. You'd be spending your time reassembling it rather than playing with it."
2,Dinosaur - gearbotics T-Rex,"I purchased this toy for a rainy day treat for my 6 year old grandson.We got it together fairly easily, but once we put in the batteries,it didn't really work at all. We kept experimenting, thinking wemight have done something wrong. However, it never reallyperformed acceptably. I am returning it."
1,Worked for less than 2 minutes,"Like the other reviewers, we got perhaps two minutes of fun out of this Sonic T-Rex before it died. The gear was stripped away immediately. We got it too long ago to return it, so it's headed for the trash. What a piece of junk!!!"
5,These are great,"Anyone who has a child in the home will love these DVDs for their child...the characters are amazing and so funny. My three year old loves them as do we the parents. Everyone will love it. Plus it has such wonderful life lessons, science projects, imagination going on too. Just great. Enjoy:)"
5,Peep is fabulous!,"I bought this as a really early birthday present for my 3yr. old, so we haven't watched it, but we've gotten lots of other Peep dvd's from our library. Peep is fabulous!!! It's a wonderful, engaging show. Good, clean, and funny! Highly recommend, which is why we bought our own instead of library rental."
4,"Good, but could have been better.",This module is actually an excellent module...if you can find some way to fit it into your campaign(which I found quite dificult). It has a good story line but it is difficult to piece together how everything works. If you are planning to start some Planar travel with your PCs then this is a good module to get. If this book was a little more understandable then it would have been five stars.
2,"Okay book, but too short.","Vortex of Madness is interesting, but weak. It has a bunch of unrelated settings that are tied together with the machine of Lum the Mad. Unfortunately, this seems like a cheap excuse to put a bunch of settings together and publish a book. The settings themselves are interesting, but not really detailed enough. If you like this idea get Well of Worlds instead. Actually, you'd be better of getting The Great Modron March and Dead Gods too, before getting this book."
5,Excellent puzzle for a three year old!,"Great colors, easy for my 3.5 year old daughter to put together! She loves it, and so do I! She can almost do it herself."
5,Simply the best yet!,"Carrie's music has been a constant companion for over a decade; With R&R, she's ""simply"" continued to add depth, texture, meaning, feeling, and real soul to the world. This is already one of my very favorite CDs. Thank You, Carrie!"
4,Storytelling rules,"Carrie Newcomer's collection ""Regulars and Refugees"" is lovely listening, providing lots of performance range for her strong alto voice. But the CD's real strength is the storytelling. Each track is the story of an regular at a small town diner - the exotic dancer ashamed of her job but trying to feed her kids, the 90 year old couple still in love, the woman just barely dealing with depression. The visual images from her remarkable lyrics and the just-right musical tone are as clear as if the CD had been a whole video.Ms. Newcomer's voice is highly listenable, and the collection offers variation in style, tempo, accompaniment and vocal texture. Still, it could have benefited by, perhaps, a contrasting vocal on a track or two."
3,Where Are All The Ufo's?,"Saw it on Netfilx,It's Actually A&E who did it in 1996. Pretty interesting,My problem isn't that it caters more to a Skeptic crowd,my problem lies that with some of the So-called ""Experts"" compare Religion along with UFOS in some parts as another Superstition."
4,Excellent creation- hope for the future!,"This is an excellent game. It is similar to pokemon in that you have monsters that you get to battle with- but in this game, you draw your own monsters!There are some drawbacks- no pun intended- there is very little game here, no adventure really. But, the fun you'll have drawing ANYTHING you ever wanted to battle with more than makes up for it. I hope they'll create another game with an expanded adventure.This is a grerat gift for kids- all of mine love it- and adults too! I steal it sometimes to draw my own stuff!Fun, fun, fun!"
4,draw your own characters!!!!!,dudes this game off the hook no off the world!!!! i could not believe the game i ordered it before it came to the us :} and let me tell you the box art and phamplet they made in this game is so cool you fall off the chair the game is so much fun that you can draw your own characters!!!!! like if you like dragonball z you can draw whatever character you want goku krilin bulma master roshi which ever when i got the game i gained points so i can draw proffesional style so i did just that and i drew yugioh and pegasis it was so cool seeing them battle TOGETHER and waching them do their attacks i put yugi to do card blades the cards gives the enimies paper cuts but not just paper cuts it can actually chop off their fingers off!!!!so if you want this game you should get it .it is really cool drawing human babies cartoons and hey babes!!!!!and then giving them life to KILLLLL.
5,beautiful,"The sound of this album is hard to describe any other way than just awesome. The way the vocals work with the intense backround music is just mind boggling. My favorite tracks are 1,4,7,8,10, and 11, but every track is good. To not have this item is doing yourself an extreme diservice. The only thing more beautiful than these three ladies is there voices. Get this as soon as possible."
3,??PRETTY HEAVY ON RELIGION??,"As a long-time PERETTI fan, I found this book at adiscount place. GREAT!! I always like to read his books.I found the religion in this book---not very subtle.A tad---beat you over the head. I REALLY would have lovedthis book if he had toned it down a little."
5,Peretti is a genius storyteller.,"Review by Jill WilliamsonJay and Lila and their archaeologist father, Dr. Cooper, enter the tombs of Anak in search of a missing coworker. Instead, they stumble onto a village where the people follow a bizarre religion. These Anakim people believe that Anak Ha-Raphah is their god and will destroy them if he becomes angry. And Dr. Cooper's meddling in the tombs has angered the god. But Dr. Cooper is not afraid. He must discover what became of his coworker and no false religion will stop him.Peretti is a genius storyteller. Even adults would enjoy these Cooper Kids Adventure classics that follow Dr. Cooper and his children as they explore this planet for history that proves the Bible is fact. As always, Peretti writes fast-paced, scary stories of good vs. evil. I enjoyed watching this mystery unfold. If you've never read a Cooper Kids book, I highly recommend them for readers ages 10 to adult."
3,Better than the first one,The door in the dragon's throat (A Crossway youth book)is this first in the series and it just was a bad book.This book with the admitted Christian propaganda is still fun and has some maybe historical reference. The writer has seemed to improve so that his plot is in places actually exciting.Those interested in biblical history that has an archeology background might like getting this for their kids.
1,Christian propaganda,"Buyer beware! Nothing on the cover reveals that this is born-again Christian propaganda,the hero an Indiana Jones who stops to pray. The bad guy actually IS an anti-god and not just a human with a sheet. I was shocked when my daughter brought it home. It is a very creepy book."
3,An Extra-Ordinary Intellectual Energy,"it has a high pitched tunnel in the world of philosophy, poetry, and Prose in general. infact it is a very nice and highly intellectual book. when i picked it up, it was as though its going to be an embarrassing journey into discoveries, but by the time i finished the last pages of the write-up, i discovered the power of its adventures and all what Mark Henshaw was really talking about.it is a Reality Beyond The Limits of Human perspective, Infact an Extraordinary Intellectual Energy. and you will really love it to the extreme because it is all about philiosphy, prose and poetry to nature."
5,Big selection.,"This is the set to have on your tool bench!, it has just about everything you will need. Its a great set."
3,Nut and bolts,"Product was okay. Packing leaves alot to be desired. Long story short, all the screws were all over the box as they came out. Had to manually sort and place them in their respective compartments. The washers were all bagged, so they were packed better.Price was a little high, but save multiple trips to the hardware store.Not a bad deal if they pack the screws better."
2,Great everything - EXCEPT video quality,"I had high hopes about this camcorder. It was cute, lightweight, the 1.3Megapixel CCD and everything appeared to be great. But once I shot the video and reviewed it on my TV. ***TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT***. What can be more important than video quality? It just sucks big time. My old Panasonic VHS camcorder has better video quality. Also, the camera picked up extremely high motor noise when ambient sound level was low or silent. NOT a good design. I read several reaviews prior to buying to camcorder and I must agree that WAIT for the next revision. Video is extremely NOT SHARP!!!"
5,Excelent compact Dictionary,"I particularly like this product for two main reasons:- it is both compact and thourough; you can find a long list of words and expressions most commonly used- the Chinese-English section is listed according to the roman alphabetical order in pinyin; the contrast of the colours used(characters, pinyin, and explanations)makes it very easy to work with this dictionaryI would also point out the cover which is resistant for a daily use."
1,This is nothing like the item I received,"Of course, it is nonreturnable, since it is a personal care item. This pic is not anywhere close to what I received when I ordered this. Do not order this item."
3,No Secrets,"There are no Secrets. It is just like other do it yourself at home spa books. Though I do like the treatments, I wish it was a little different. Worth the money if your looking for an at home treatment book. Give it a try. My version of 3 stars is slightly above average."
1,waste of money,"This book is a waste of money. Don't repeat my mistake.Nice pictures. That is all.Receipts require ingredients that hard to find or cost much. Moreover many receipts like body wraps, baths...will leave your bath so dirty that you will never repeat the procedure: the clean up after it will kill all the pleasures if you have some.I guarantee you will not do a single receipt. .. sorry may be a smoothie... but wait I am sure you know how to prep you fav smoothie without this book."
5,Excellent Book! I already look (and feel) 5 years younger!,"This is the best spa book yet! So may of them are unrealistic and made for people who are already supermodels. This spa book is made for the every-day woman with varying body and skin types and different needs. The recipes were imaginative, virtually chemical free and fun to make. I took the day off work today and made about five of the recipes. I feel relaxed and when my husband came home he commented on how vibrant and beautiful I look. Thank you Secrets of the Spa."
3,"Good, but not a keeper","I was a rather disappointed in this book. I guess I was looking for something that would have spa treatments that I could make from my own kitchen using items I already had on hand. Unfortunately, most of these treatments require things like beeswax and essential oils. I only found one recipe that I was able to use the minute I received the book."
1,Not a classic despite its age,"Poorly organized and uncritical adulation of the Scotch-Irish by a Protestant Ulster native reflecting her prejudices. This is not a scholarly work as much of the information is irrelevant to the book's title and ostensible theme with numerous references to American History in general, discussion of Ulster history far beyond colonial times, and a negative assessment of 19th century Irish Catholic immigration to America."
5,"Excellent Value, very functional","I've been using it for TWO YEARS now. It's still working great. Very comfortable carrying around, good protection of laptop, also it's very light weight. Highly recommend!"
5,As if it's not there!,"I have been searching for a backpack style computer bag for some time. I wasn't sure my back would be able to handle it--I'm an English teacher with papers to grade and computer to transport daily. All fit well in the storage space. The computer is anchored in its own compartment well-padded. There are places for your pens, calculators, power cord, cell phone and charger. I am exceptionally please with my purchase--now I have two free hands to escort my two young children to and from school. AND I don't have the back/shoulder pain my shoulder strap bag left me with."
4,Lap Top backpack,"Great design for the best price. I received my new backpack in just a few days, which was great. I love the design is simple, but elegant and the padding on the straps make the load very comfortable."
5,Cool look for a laptop + extra space,"I've always liked backpacks, but some styles that fit laptops are just a bit too outdoorsy looking for me. This Factor is really cool because it's comfortable, looks a little more hip and urban, plus I really like the two-tone brown. I can keep my laptop safe and stash extra stuff like sunglasses, keys, cellphone in the extra pockets."
5,Lowepro Backpack Factor,I like the Lowepro Backpack Factor a lot. It's comfortable and nice looking. Good workmanship and quality.
4,a nice bag,"i was looking for a lap backpack to carry my mac pro 15, this bag serves the purpose well.I won't recommend this bag to men. It just looks too cute and a bit funny"
4,Its perfect for the price,"It is a really nice back pack, it is not a big one, but it is nice. I can carry 3 books, a laptop, some folders, and other things. I like this because it does not seem to be a backpack for laptops."
3,Crow Fishtank Figure,"I love the crow, and when the original crow figure came out, I ran out and purchased it right away. When it comes to details I McFarlane sets the standard. I just wish the figures were a little more stable when displayed. I think they (at McFarlane Toys) have made improvements to their figures since this one was released. This one (Fishtank edition) took some work to finally get the figure to stand,(Hint:The figure keeps falling over to one side, so play with the position of the base to offset the figure, and it will center.) and the crow kept coming off, but once I got it to stand it became the center piece of my collection. The one thing about both crow figures(Fishtank, and original) they look good in the packaging, and look better when taken out and displayed."
3,1st movie great - 2nd movie awful,"Well, I just had to do it... I had to order the disc with both movies because 1 - I never saw the 2nd one and 2 - it was cheap so I figured what they hay. The first Dragonheart was a very good movie. It came out shortly after Jurassic Park and used the same special effects for Draco as the dinosaurs... very cool and Dennis Quaid did a great job as a knight.The 2nd movie was ridiculous... maybe it was made for TV? Effects - crappy, Acting - crappy, Story - worse than crappy... It's a shame because the brother from Malcolm in the Middle stars and I like him in general, but this was a kidney stone of a film... I want my 90 minutes of life back I wasted on this flick!"
4,5 for DH; 2 for DH2,"Dragonheart is a classic, great mixture of action and satire fully deserving of 5 stars. DH2 is pretty much a lame feature that's only similarity to DH is the dragonology. It lacks both the humor and action of the first, and the acting isn't great. You won't miss anything if you only buy DH. Only get the double feature if you feel like splurging."
4,Dragonheart - 2 Legendary Tales Double Bill,The original Dragonheart is great and well worth it as for #2 it is not so Legendary or even a good tale.
3,TWO MOVIES!?!,Get rid of disc two and you have a great value. Dragonheart is a classic. Number two is an unnecessary piece of crap. Enough said.
4,"The first was fantastic, but the ""New Beginning"" lacked","The original Dragonheart is one of my all time favorite movies. It takes a cliché idea and expands on it until it is not only unique, but incredibly profound. It is a healthy blend of believable action, drama, and occasional humor. One of the best movies of all time (although many would disagree with me on this)The second one, however, was just shameful. The way the first one ended was very final, and it was impossible to make a good sequel. The sequel should have never been made. It was poorly put together, didn't flow well, the characters annoyed me, and the drama lacked that magical touch the first one had. The clichés remained clichés instead of becoming the work of art the fist one was.If you buy this, buy it for the original. It is rather difficult to find, and you usually have to get it used. I gave this product four stars because the first movie is still well worth the money. Take care enjoy the film."
5,DVD,"I bought this movie when my kids were young in VHS. They are gone, but I love this movie so had to get in DVD. No problems at all with this vendor."
2,Not as Pictured,Picture and description implies two rolls (liners). Only one is included. Ordered three items expecting 6 rolls. Received only 3 rolls.
5,EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT!,"This book is ideal for anyone, whether they own one snake or 1,000. Helpful for other reptiles to, as many of the techniques will work equally well if not better with lizards and amphibians. The list of snakes they include is suberb - they have all of the half a dozen or so snakes I would recommend most in a display tank, and then many more that I didn't even think of! Wonderful book, get this is you've just begun with snakes, had them a while or are thinking about getting one. It can make your reptiles' lives much better, as well as your own with a nicer looking, cleaner and (and for you environmentally aware types) greener!"
2,"Decent tuner, but not built to last","I've been playing guitar for 46 years (damn - that's scary). These Fender tuners are relatively accurate, are simple to use, and have a decent display. The problem is that they break within 6 months if you gig regularly (or even use them in rehearsals regularly). Yes, you can get them to last a longer time if you 'baby' them and just use them for practice at home, but if you're just going to sit on your living room couch and play, get a cheaper tuner that's just as accurate that will last a much longer time."
1,Total P.O.C.,I am a huge fan of Fender guitars and amps. I own several Tele's and Strat's as well as four Fender amps. But this tuner is a total piece of cr@p. Not only does it feel cheap---it doesn't work worth a darn. I sent it back and got a refund.
2,Not very reliabel,"In the beginning this tuner worked like a charm. About 6 weeks later the LEDs went out without warning. After contacting Fender about warrenty work, they wanted me to pay shipping to their repair shop. Why should I pay to have something repaired under warrrenty? (maybe I am wrong). Looking back I would spend a little more and get better quality. The case is plastic not metal, although that was not an issue here, it may become one if it gets packed away or bounced around traveling to shows."
2,Doesn't work for my vehicle.,I'm sure the product itself would work as advertised. The problem is that the little thing that Amazon puts on the items page to verify it would fit on your vehicle is wrong. It does not in fact work for a 2002 Jeep Liberty. I really wish it would have worked because the only other thing I could find to fit my vehicle cost over $50 after shipping. This one was only $20 with shipping. If it will work for your vehicle it's a great deal.
4,Great towel,"This is a great and quite practical towel. It's easy to use, wash, carry with you on trips. It's really handy in between body brushing which I do with my Japanese body brush. I prefer the Japanese skin brush over the towel because it does more of a thorough job when it comes to removing dead skin cells and revealing smooth new skin. However, the towel really is quite handy in between brushes. My skin is always polish smooth."
2,Too rough for my skin,This is the first of these types of towels I have tried. It seems really rough on my skin. I am choosing to use other products for exfoliation.
5,delivers what it advertises,"Works so well you'll never need to purchase exfolliants again. Just use with your favorite facial cleanser but only once a week. Buy two and use the other for legs, etc."
5,Bang for your buck!,The K&N drop in filter is easy to install and increased performance is realized immediately. It definitely pays for itself.
3,Never done anything like it.,"I am very mixed about my review of this dvd. First of all it wasnt really what I expected, but it's not a total loss. I had planned to use this dvd on my recovery days, but no way..this is quite a workout itself! For now, I think I just need to pick up an actual traditional yoga video, learn moves and improve my balance, then attempt this again. Incorporating aerobics is an awesome idea, but I found it a little confusing and difficult because the moves take some time to master on their own."
4,Not quite what I expected,This really wasn't what I expected in a Yoga DVD. That being said I still loved it. I alternate Jillian's DVD's every week and this one is a nice way to relax and stretch my sore muscles. I have not completed level 2 yet but I can only imagine it's just as fun as level 1.
2,I wanted to like this..,"I really wanted to like this.Jillian is tough,I knew that when I purchased this,but I had thought that since it was supposed to be yoga she would at least try to tone it down a bit.But she didn't! The moves do not flow well at all.I personally felt like I was going to get dizzy from moving from standing to kneeling to lying on the floor so quickly,she does not explain the positions and you end up craning your neck to try to see what she is talking about.Jillian,do us all a favor and stick to regular workouts.I would not recomend this to anyone looking for a real yoga type experience,even though I have never done much yoga even I know this was not it!"
2,meh,"I got this on demand because it was a little less expensive than other titles and I thought it would be challenging. Jillian is annoying and there is no flow to the workout. Her instructions are crap (doesn't ever specify which leg to take back, etc) and I think it's a little too easy to have bad form on this. I really wouldn't even call this yoga. If you do a lot of intermediate yoga DVD's at home, her choppy and disjointed flows will probably annoy you, too."
1,Sprained my neck!,This is a jumble of easy moves mixed with very challenging moves with almost no natural progression. There is very little warm up so I badly sprained my neck somewhere in the routine. Jillian Michaels is honest and make no pretense about being a yoga expert. Go elsewhere.
4,not your average yoga video,i'm a big fan of jillian michaels. i've done several of her videos and this one seems to be in line with most of her others. you're not going to get a traditional yoga by any means. i generally fall asleep during yoga... this one is much more of a strength workout with reps and a faster pace than regular yoga. it's great for a workout that you don't want to be super intense but you want to stay awake during.
4,Kicks your butt,"This is an awesome DVD, but not for beginners. You can do the easier version of the workout, but if you're completely out of shape (as I am) it takes awhile to get into it. It's not your standard yoga DVD.....has more strengthening in it than others. It is however a great way to get in shape!!!"
5,Surprised,I've never done yoga before but even the first level was easy enough that I felt like I could do it multiple times a day but difficult enough that all my muscles felt sore the next day. I'm looking forward to moving up to the next 2 levels!
5,superstar,"I LOVE this video. Jillian Michaels is an awesome woman and she's a great instructor. Very fast-paced yoga, which is exactly what I was looking for and it's so much fun to do!"
4,great workout,"I have this dvd now for a few weeks and have tried exercising the 1st level... which is a bit easier and I still can't do everything. However, after the first workout I could feel all of my muscles, meaning it really puts you entire body to work. Wether one will lose weight or not exercising with this DVD - I can't judge, but I think it is really good dvd to put one in good shape... I already feel better and have better movement range of my hurting knee!I give it 4 stars just because I can't really do everything even at the 1st level... may be it should be than 4 stars for me not for dvd?!"
4,Yoga...the Jillian Way,"I love this DVD. I did not really have weight to lose, but I really needed to tone up and this definitely does the trick! I only wish there were more workouts. She may not be very flexible, but I think I like it even better that she herself cannot do some of the moves. The workouts are quick and you can either choose to do the easy route or once you get stronger you can incorporate more advanced moves. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to tone-up and not sweat your butt off!"
5,Great workout DVD!,I bought this DVD because I was looking for a yoga DVD that also had some cardio in it. I like that it has 2 levels in it. It's a good intermediate yoga DVD.
2,It does not have much to do with yoga,"I have bought most JM'DVDs from Amazon, but yoga is certainly not her specialty. This is a ok workout, if you just forget the word: yoga."
4,Yoga Meltdown,I love Yoga Meltdown. I have not done yoga before but I find the routines on this DVD very easy to follow. The pace is just right for me. It's not slow like traditional yoga. Jillian is a terrific and motivational trainer. She makes you want to finish the yoga routines and continue them the following day. Buy Yoga Meltdown. You will love it.
5,Great Workout!,This is a great workout with two levels for beginners and intermediate fitness levels. I recommend this DVD highly!Jillian Michaels: Yoga Meltdown
3,More Meltdown than Yoga,"I want to begin by saying that I love Jillian and I swear by her workouts, in particular her 30 Day Shred.That being said I agree with previous posts, this workout will get your heart pumping. However Yoga is more of a slow paced venture. She leaves little to no time for recovery after poses. I also feel like there should be more holding in the poses.Enough rambling... bottom line... it's a good workout, but it's not a great Yoga workout!"
4,Great DVD,I did this DVD for the first time yesterday and found it to be a great DVD. It wasn't boring and definitely was a challenge. I am very overweight - have lost about 20 lbs in 2 months and still have another 50 to go. I have been working out at least 5 times a week using different DVD workouts and exercise TV. I have been using the 30 day shred more consistently than the others and also use the Biggest Loser Yoga for weight loss. This one was difficult but not so difficult that I quit before I made it through the first time. I will continue to use this for variety because I do bore easily. My only complaint is that it was a little hard on my knees but I am sure that will get better as I am able to do all the exercises correctly. My advice is- just buy it.... It makes a great addition to your exercise library..
1,Not a Yoga workout for beginners,I have often found yoga to be challenging. The only time I enjoy it without injury to myself is when the instructor is knowledgeable. I love Jillian Michaels 30 day shred but she is not a Yoga instructor and she should keep to exercise that she knows.Not for the beginners or anyone with knee injuries.
1,"Love Jillian, but HATE this workout!","I am a big fan of 30 day shred and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism. I also enjoy yoga styled workouts like Ellen Barrett's Studio Series, so I imagined Jillian's Yoga Meltdown to be a perfect marriage of the two. Boy was I wrong.The poses are awkward and unnatural, the moves do not flow, and there is no deep breathing or mind-body aspect to this workout. Jillian's approach and instruction work great for her other videos, but I found myself frustrated, bored, and annoyed with this one. Total waste of money."
4,Awesome but not for newbies,"This video is a great value because it has two 30 minute workouts: level 1 & level 2. I think it will take me a while to master both of these workouts.However, I don't recommend it for anyone who is completely new to yoga. I consider myself to be an intermediate level yoga practitioner, and I still was challenged by it. I think those that don't already know basic yoga poses will experience some frustration. But, that's just one opinion and some may still enjoy the challenge.It will get your heart rate up and you will sweat. I'd love to know how many calories I burn doing this workout :-)"
3,Good but not real yoga,"I really like Jillian. I have a bunch of her other stuff and I think she is a great motivator. I bought this DVD just b/c I love her other workouts. Her workouts are the only workouts that I do at home where I really break a sweat. I have practiced yoga casually for about 8 years now. I have to say that this workout is tough and challenging but it's NOT yoga. She is obviously not a yoga instructor, which is fine but this can be particularly dangerous for those who have never practiced these yoga poses. One thing that bothered me is that she is very focused on a good challenge and not quite interested in the pose/counterpose practice. This is essential when you are doing intense backbends and forward bends.If you've practiced yoga before *and* you like Jillian and/or her workouts, then you'll like this. Otherwise, proceed with caution."
1,Jillian and Yoga do not mix Vol.2,"I saw this title in another review and I couldn't agree more. I am a great JM fun, she kicks butt in the Banish Fat, Trouble Zones and 30-day shred DVDs, but this one.... I love Yoga, I have DVDs (try Bryan Kest for a great workout at the right tone) and I have classes where my butt is kicked without ever raising the the tone of voice just by hanging out in a pose for a minute. Jillian's instruction feels all wrong for this type of exercise. She is meant to do boot camps, not lead meditation practices. I should have known better when I bought the DVD, but I really liked everything she did so I thought I give it a try. Big waste of money. Maybe it's ok for people who have never done yoga before in their lives and who want a variation on daily training, but it's definitely not for those who actually want to do yoga. I think Jillian should just stick with what she knows and make more kick-butt workouts to offer variety to her audience."
1,Very disappointed,I bought this based on a casual reading of the reviews yet was very disappointed. I own dozens of yoga DVD's ... this is not yoga. Jillian's talking was extremely annoying. There were two models demonstrating beginner / advanced poses but they were often in poor alignment. Wish I could return it.
5,You'll be dropping your first week!,"I never tried Yoga before, hell I'm hardly in shape, but this has helped me than anything else I have tried. I'm confident that I'll loose the weight with video and kick boxing. It's fun. I hardly notice the time passing and you feel so good when you are done! I've already dropped 3 pounds and 4 inches, in under a week. Jillian is one of the best coaches around. Strained shoulder and tendonitis of the foot,they never felt better!"
3,Yoga,Brought for my daughter. I heard her says she liked it. I have not tried it. I don't like the requirement of number of words to this review.
1,NOT PLEASED,"WORKED WELL FIRST TIME,SECOND USE, PART TWO SKIPS CONSTANTLY CAN USE PART ONE. OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE A GOOD WORKOUT VIDEO"
1,Sell Out!!,"Weight loss Yoga? Not happening people. Lets look at the some science here.So she says.. lose 5lbs in a week... since there is 3500 calories in ONE lbs... that is 17,500 calories in FIVE lbs. Even if you were super HUGE and couldn't walk through your front door, you are not going to burn this. 180lb man will burn about 200 calories an hour doing yoga... so MAYBE you will get 300 with this.... but probably not.Sure, go for it! You can do it. Plunk down your $$... just know...YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO 87 HOURS A WEEK WORTH OF YOGA!!!!!She makes me sick marketing this stuff this way.FYI. I am certified personal trainer and a yoga instructor. This stuff ticks me off. She is using her 'as seen on TV' to swindle people out of their cash. You can add to her piggy bank if you want. What do you give someone who has millions... more money I guess... you should go by her diet pills too.. better act quick she is being sued for 5 million for false advertising. Looks like she is doing it again <sigh>"
1,bad video for beginners,"The $15 I spent on this video was a huge waste. I've tried doing this video multiple times on Level 1 and still find it very frustrating. She does not properly explain the poses, nor does she give you any time to get into the groove of one pose before going into another. It's like she just expects you to be able to watch the screen and immediately know how to do the pose. Of course, even if it were that easy, for many of the poses your head is supposed to be down. Maybe if you are already well versed in yoga poses, it would be better. I've done a few classes, but am still very new to yoga. For semi-beginners, bluntly put, this video stinks. This was my first Jillian Michaels video, and will be my last. Maybe she should go searching for quick cash in an area more suitable. She is clearly NOT a yoga instructor."
3,Beginners dvd,"I know all yoga is different, but with this one I was hoping because it was Jillian Michaels this was going to be a little tougher than it was. Transitions were quick and she is humorous while tring to push you. I am a fitness instructor and in pretty good shape, but new to the Yoga world. I found this easy to follow, but I also found it easy to do. I was looking for a little more. Would recommend for a beginner but not for anyone who is a regular exerciser."
2,Not this one...,"I have three other Jillian DVDs - and love them. I was hoping this would be intense in a different way, like yoga should be. The other reviewers are right: this isn't yoga. It is yoga poses in her style of circuit training. Which, in and of itself, is fine. But I got through this workout without breaking much of a sweat at all. I have other power yoga DVDs (that are actually *yoga*) and break more of a sweat in the first 15 minutes. If you like Jillian, you may not like this one."
2,I Look Forward to the Garage Sale...,"After the birth of my son in October, I struggled to get back into my weight loss routines. Since I had a C-Section, it's taken a lot longer to reach my previous fitness levels and the scale isn't moving as fast as I'd like. Enter Jillian Michaels! I enjoy a lot of her DVDs (30 Day Shred, 6 Week 6 Pack, and the Ultimate Body duo). I bought the Yoga Meltdown because I wanted to increase balance and flexibility, but without the guru-mantra-hippie feel of other Yoga videos. What I got instead could be entitled ""Stretching 101"" instead of any kind of meltdown. I didn't even break a sweat, so this DVD was shuffled to the bottom of the pile. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I DID enjoy that it wasn't all about the hippie junk. Still, not for me. Thanks!"
2,"Good workout, but shouldn't be called yoga","I should preface this by saying I have a lot of experience with power yoga. The only reason I'm giving this DVD two stars is because it made me sweat and was a good workout. That was the only thing I liked about it. She tries to combine cardio movement with yoga and the end result is something that's not really yoga at all, even though it incorporates yoga postures. The box says vinyasa, but to be more accurate, it should be called ""yoga cardio fusion"" or something along those lines. It's by no means an intro to vinyasa and there is almost zero emphasis on proper alignment or breathing. If you just want a workout and don't really care how you get from point A to point B, maybe this DVD is for you. If this is your first venture into yoga practice, you will most likely get the wrong idea. If I were looking for an introduction to vinyasa yoga and I thought this DVD was it, I would be completely turned off to practicing yoga."
5,very happy,"not your traditional yoga, as the flows are much faster paced. Very happy with the workout. also enjoyed there was more instruction than ""inspiration"" as seen in 30 day shred. heart rate elevated and i did break a sweat. totally worth the money. using in unison with 30 day shred to prevent boredom/burnout."
2,not a very good yoga video,"I love the JM workout DVDs and I enjoy yoga. Since much of her strength training is yoga based, I thought this would be better.It just isn't. She doesn't guide you toward proper positions and even promotes pushing to improper positions. I was not impressed with this DVD ... if I could return it, I would."
3,Good Short Workout Not Very Yoga-ish,"I liked this video and the two separate workout options available to me. The workouts definitely got my muscles burning and, at times, my heart rate elevated. The moves are all based on yoga moves, but she moves you so quickly through them that it's more of a focus on strength and ""cardio"" as opposed to balance, stretching or the typical feel of a yoga workout. It's a good workout, but not truly yoga if that's what you are looking for."
3,Not a really great yoga work out.,I initially thought this was an intense work out. Then I actually got into yoga and now I am kind of disappointed with it. It was really painful on my shoulders. Yoga is not painful at all. I like Jillian Michaels most of the time. This was just not a very well thought out work out. Probably will never do it again. Way to rough on my shoulders.
4,mch,"Not your usuall yoga practice, but really liked it. I like to combine it with one of her shred workouts. I work out about 5-6 days a week and practice yoga. If you have never done yoga, it moves a little fast because she doesn't give you much instruction on proper form, which is why i gave it only 4 stars."
4,Yoga,It has been great! easy going easy to understand it almost feels as if she is in the room with you to get you tooshie going and doing it right!
4,Good morning stretch,"Jillian always gives me a good challenge. I was surprised by how easy the first video was....of course she came through with her usual ""push you to your limits"" personna in the 2nd video.It's a good yoga workout for people that aren't looking to be yogi pretzels!"
3,Not Typical Yoga,"This video will give you a workout. However, it's not typical yoga. She incorporates cardio into yoga poses. You should know a little bit about yoga poses before doing this workout. She does not explain proper alignment much, which can lead to injury. Another downside is she doesn't tell you which side to work, and it is easy to forget which side (left or right) you are to be working out. Lastly, I don't think there was enough of a cool down. She does a few stretches at the end and that's all. I've done the workout a few times, and I think I'm ready to find a new dvd."
5,Fantastic yoga dvd,"Jillian is a thorough yet fun instructor. This yoga workout is difficult, both part 1 and 2. I highly recommend it. Don't fret if it takes you a long time to be able to do this with ease. It still provides a tough workout for me."
5,Awesome!!!,"I love this video. Easy steps that really work your body hard. Two levels to help get you started. Although this looks easy, trust me it's not...at least for me. I sweat like crazy and after two days of doing it...can feel every muscle in my body. So it must be working. Jillian rocks as usual."
1,Jillian is awful in this!,"While I know Jillian Michaels is known for being a tough trainer and really pushing people, she and yoga do not mix! The workouts are intense and you can feel the burn afterwards but I do not enjoy the yoga aspect in this video. Yoga is about relaxation and moving your body along with your breath. In this video, you are constantly moving in the poses which works your body more but the whole time Jillian is yelling at you to ""FOCUS ON YOUR BREATH!"" and clapping her hands together. It really takes away from the whole yoga experience. She also complains a lot about not being very flexible and that's why she doesn't do most of the moves. I need someone WAY less intense for yoga."
3,It's okay,"This is my favorite workout DVD of her collection. However, it is not my favorite Workout DVD that I own."
3,Not good for Arthritis,"I try to find a lot of low impact type exercises that don't leave my bones aching because I have arthritis. Many people have told me Yoga was especially good for patients with joint problems since it requires a lot of stretching. The video had a lot of moves requiring you to get up and down on the mat repetitively. Although I'm able to do most of the exercises it was painful getting up and down again and again. If you have bad knees, or joint problems this is not the video for you, I'm able to do Jillian's other workouts without too much difficulty."
3,Not a very great yoga workout,"I am a total yogi and love yoga for the relaxation, strength building and overall combination of the two. The workout was okay but I only did it once and dont plan on doing it again. I think this video is for someone with an entry level acitvity level, looking for an intro to working out and yoga."
4,Probably not for Yoga purists,"I really liked this workout. I need to work on my flexibility, but both yoga and pilates just seem way too boring to me. This was a great compromise -- there are traditional yoga moves with an aerobic slant. I could see how yoga purists wouldn't like this, but for me it was just right."
3,High Hopes,"I did Jillian's 30 Day Shred before starting this workout and saw great results. I've had this DVD for 3 weeks, have tried it a few times (Level 1 only so far) and can't get into it. I used to do the Shred before work and found that it was easy to get up in the morning and get myself working out. Not with this one, I've been hitting the snooze button for 5 days straight! The pace is a slow and I don't find myself sweating. Disappointed ."
3,"A good bodyweight workout, but not yoga.","I LOVE vinyasa/power yoga. I love how fast it is and how it moves rhythmically with the breath, strengthening both your body and spirit. I also like Jillian Michaels - 30 day shred is great. That said, I got this instant vid because I needed a bodyweight workout while visiting my boyfriend, and I liked the workout, but I think that calling it yoga is really misleading. She's taken yoga moves that are also bodyweight strength moves and put them into her circuit style workout - it's effective, but it's not yoga. There's no breathing rhythm to it.I'll keep doing this one on the go, though."
3,If you are a Jillian Fan . . .,"you will like her high rep style of yoga. Jillian makes this a ""meltdown"" by emphasizing lots of reps and less body alignment. It's clear from her own execution of this video that JM is great in the gym, but does not have a strong sense of body awareness that Karen Voight has. Her half moon is a pose that does not extend from her core. The workouts do not have the flow that Sadie Nardini, Karen Voight or Denise Austin have in their videos. Frankly, I thinhk the above and The Firm's power yoga videos are just as effective."
4,Intense Yoga Toning,"This Yoga DVD is definitely intense. If you have not previously practiced Yoga or at least Pilates it will definitely be hard to follow with the video. I personally enjoy this video, although I have a friend that is not the biggest fan, mainly because this video goes a little fast, and so if you are not careful you can definitely pull something, this is especially a caution for beginners. In general, I love the intensity of the DVD, and I love how tone, and stretched my body feels. Definitely worth looking!"
5,A new twist in yoga,"Absolutely great!! Powerful yoga poses + Jillian dynamic training technics. Just a new way to practice yoga, although maybe not suited for advanced yoga practices, because it is not ""regular"" yoga."
3,"It's good, but not as good as others",It's all ways a good workout with Jillian but I don't think this one is so great. I get a better burn out of Bob's Biggest Loser yoga.
2,Not my style,"If you are looking for a ""power flow"" yoga DVD, I would not recommend this workout. It is full of poses with semi-fast repetative motions. It doesn't really capture the true essence or meaning of the practice of yoga. Pretty much a typical workout video. The ""intermediate/advance"" workout wasn't my style AT ALL. I like the classes at studios with power flow with an intermediate pace. if you like those classes, i would NOT recommend this video."
3,Not her best,"I have all Jillian's dvds. I really believe her strengths are in ""traditional"" exercise work. I love all the others- 30 day shred and shred it with weights are my favorites, this however I think is the weakest in her lineup. She tries to make it more of a cardio workout (like hot yoga maybe?).It just comes across as chaotic- no real order. It's just ok"
2,Not good for the lower-back!!!,"I really like some of Jillian's other DVDs (30 day shred, banish fat, no more trouble zones) but this one is not for me. It made my lower back scream in pain!!!!! There is a lot of moving from a standing position to a floor position - which makes it difficult to follow and perform the correct positions."
5,After run workout,Usually I hate yoga becuase it's too slow but Jillian Michaels makes yoga an actual workout and I was sore afterwards.
3,Great if you know yoga poses,"This is a fun and balanced yoga video IF you know the proper alignment for poses. Gillian offers very little advise on proper body position so if you are new to yoga this is not the dvd for you. However, if you are a bit of a yogi its an enjoyable way to get in a quIck but energetic yoga moment."
5,Makes you work,"After I had started working out regularly, I decided to get this DVD hoping to get that long, lean look. Man, it sure does take some strength on some of these moves. I love how Jillian incorporates cardio in with yoga. It definitely tested my core strength."
4,Hard!!!,"I enjoy Jillian Michaels workouts. I like her style and the way she motivates. I had the Shred DVD and the 6 Pack DVDs prior to purchasing her Yoga DVD. I also have a good yoga foundation from videos from Gaiam Yoga. That said; I found this DVD very difficult to get in sync with. What many people said in the reviews about the transitions between poses being fast, I found to be true. The poses are difficult and incorporate cardio in Jillian's usual style. I just don't have the balance at this point to keep up and do an effective workout. I'm looking forward to when I do though, so I will give it another try later."
3,Speed Yoga,"The point of yoga is to hold a pose and increase strength/stamina/endurance. This is more like ""speed yoga"" where you fly through the poses. This might be okay if you do not enjoy holding yoga poses for very long. I have her 30 day shred DVD and that is a great workout. I did not enjoy this DVD as much."
3,"I love JIllian, but this should be for advanced people.","I had never tried yoga before and I have to say that this was too difficult for me, a moderate exerciser. I would get some yoga training under my belt before I would try this again. I was unable to finish it the 2 times I tried."
5,Love this workout! (and I HATE working out!!),"I had always wanted to try yoga, but was afraid it would be too zen and weird for me. But I saw this DVD, and figured anything with Queen Badass Jillian Michaels couldn't be too bad. It is exactly what I wanted. It's helped me lose weight and get much stronger. I highly highly highly recommend it!!"
5,Good toning tool,"If you're looking for a typical yoga DVD this is not it, however it is a good toning tool. I purchased this DVD to add to my current workouts, which are more high impact cardio. I wanted something to tone before swimsuit season arrived and to take off the pesky 5 lbs of winter weight. I lost 3lbs in a matter of a few days and could tell a difference in my body in a week. I look at this DVD as more of an athletic yoga and definitely not a beginner's yoga. There are two different levels and the first level is definitely challenging. This DVD is great paired with cardio such as spinning, kickboxing or bootcamp. I do a cardio class at the gym in the morning and the DVD in the evening and as I said I've had great results. If you're strict with your yoga practice this DVD may seem like a mockery of yoga, but if you're looking to get in shape and try something different and challenging this is a great workout!"
5,Butt-kicking workout!,"This dvd was exactly what I was looking for! I gave birth a few months ago and was looking for a workout video that gives you a full body exercise. I don't own a treadmill or bike or anything and doing this video I can stay right at home w/my baby and still get an amazing workout. There are two different levels on this dvd, and Jillian Michaels does it in her own unique style. If you're looking for a pure form of yoga this is not it. She does ""reps"" on various yoga positions which I love because I don't want to just stretch and meditate. I am healthy and not overweight, and I am drenched in sweat by the end of level 1.Love it, love it!"
5,Yoga Jillian Style,If your into traditional yoga you may not enjoy this DVD. I have done yoga here and there over the years. Not really a fan of Yoga I do it on my off days. But I do like this nice twist on yoga Jillian did. I'm on day 12 of the 30 Day Shred and it's going fairly well. This was just as challenging as it. Sweating right off the bat. Defiantly a new staple in my workout routine. I call this Yogian. Yoga + Jillian= Yogian. She definitely owns this. So if your wondering if this is the right DVD for you think about your workout style.
2,My least favorite Jillian Michaels DVD,"I should have known Jillian's competitive/aggressive style would not work with yoga, but I bought it anyway. The workout itself is okay, I guess, but I prefer the gentle and encouraging style of Sarah Ivanhoe when getting a yoga groove on."
2,Definitely not for the yoga beginner,"I put this on for the first time yesterday. I've done a little yoga in the past, both video and yoga classes, and I think this is definitely not true yoga. I love Jillian, but I don't think she's qualified to teach yoga. She rushed straight away into advanced moves and doesn't ease into the incorporating strength training at all. If you were new to yoga postures you would probably hurt yourself. Not a big fan of this dvd just yet."
2,This isn't yoga,"This isn't a yoga video. I'm a big fan of Jillian's workouts and this is a great workout. But this is not a yoga practice. Jillian has taken a few yoga poses and bastardized them into reps, so that you break a sweat in 30 minutes. But there is no semblance of yoga in this. It is an aerobic workout using yoga poses as the basis for the moves. So if you're looking for an actual yoga practice, this isn't it. But like her other workouts, you will break a sweat and do so in 30 minutes."
3,Well..,"This is a good work-out. It will make you sweat, but probably isn't suitable for someone just getting into exercising or who hasn't exercised in a while. It will take some balance and coordination and will make your heart pound.The bad news is, that after I purchased this, I found out that the distributor makes this video available for free on other popular video-sharing sites. I would love if this was on Amazon Prime as an Instant Video, too, but I don't think it is. Not sure why it would be free elsewhere but not available for prime. It's a mystery."
2,Not Good,I like Jillian's other videos but I have to say nobody should do Yoga at home from a DVD without at least going to take some classes. You need an instructor to correct your posture and poses to make sure you are doing them correctly and make sure you do not get hurt.
2,"power yoga, but not so great","I wanted a power yoga, but its way to obvious yoga is not J.M. favorite form of exercise since she rushes through the moves WAY to much with an uninterested expression and adds moves in that arent yoga... ok, but inot my fave video from her. She needs to stick to the ""SHRED"" style videos."
3,good dvd...,"The video is a yoga video. It is good, but kind of easy. It's what I paid for. I would recommend it if you asked."
1,Yoga meltdown,"I am not a fan of this video. I have other Jillian Michaels videos that I like but this isn't one of them. I've taken yoga classes before and this isn't yoga. This is Jillian's take on it. Yoga is about strengthening and stretching out the body. You never ""jump"" into the pose nor do you incorperate aerobics.If you want a workout video for burning calories, I suggest 30 day shredIf you want the strengthening, there's shred it with weightsIf you want yoga, look elsewhere."
3,"good fitness program, but it's not yoga","If you are a yoga student and are looking for a yoga DVD, this is not what you're looking for. This is a nice ""fitness"" workout for people interested in burning calories and there are some yoga-based poses in it, but this is nothing like you'll see in a yoga studio, even if you're studying one of the more agressive and flowing styles, like Astanga.I like Jillian. I think she has done a lot of good work in the fitness industry. I like her other DVDs and love the TV shows she has done. She is extremely inspiring. Not a yoga teacher though.If you're looking for a fitness program to burn calories, go for it. If you're looking for yoga, try something like Rodney Yee, or you want a female teacher who will be similar to what you might think you're getting with this, Shiva Rae."
4,Very Good,"This DVD is not your traditional relaxation or meditation yoga, obviously because meltdown is in the title and Jillian is the trainer :). This yoga exercise has traditional poses but focuses more on raising your heartrate doing those poses (instead of concentrating on breathing etc). It is exactly what I was looking for, I actually broke a sweat and can feel muscles working that I have a hard time getting to in the gym. Jillian is also very good in this DVD and is not pushy. The only con I see is that there isn't a lot of instruction for beginners so if you haven't learned the poses prior you may have to watch the DVD through once or twice. You can also do a preview before you purchase :)"
4,Pretty Great,"This video was better than i thought actually. I really liked this workout, it really does work every muscle. Although it's not as relaxing as normal yoga it works. I'm not bored yet and i've had it a couple weeks now! :)"
5,What a workout,"I have only tried workout 1, but what a great workout! It's a great, quick, workout and you really get a good sweat going. I can't wait to keep going with it and work my way up to workout 2!"
3,Decent workout,"This yoga workout is okay. I did not break a sweat, however, certain muscles were sore the next day. Jillian does a good job of keeping you moving and burning calories. The workouts are only 25 minutes, sort of short in my opinion. You can easily do both levels as one workout. I think Jillian's yoga knowledge is limited--and this shows in her lack of alignment and some poor descriptions of poses. I guess I should add that I'm an experienced yogini, and have been practicing yoga for 9 years. For a more vigorous workout, try Jillian's Extreme Shed & Shred."
3,"Not Yoga, but a good workout","If I'm rating this DVD as a Yoga workout, I give it 1 star. At very best, Jillian knows the names of some important poses like downward dog and it seems like she's probably heard somewhere that she should remind you to breath, but her knowledge of yoga doesn't really extend beyond that. You get the sense that she may have taken 5 minutes to google ""yoga"" and developed a workout from there. She has no respect for the practice and at times it feels like she's almost making fun of it. If you're looking for true power yoga, stick to Batiste or Rodney Yee.On the other hand, yoga or not, this is an awesome workout-I would give it 5 stars for kicking my butt! If you don't really care about practicing yoga and you just want a great body weight workout, this is it. In fact, I could have rated it much higher if she just would have called it Barefoot Bootcamp :)"
1,Not really yoga,"I bought this to supplement the yoga classes I was already taking. Jillian uses terminology incorrectly and her breathing is out of sync (she instructs you to inhale when you should be exhaling, and vice versa). I think she just jumped on the popularity yoga was having at the time."
5,More OW! Less Ohm.....,"I am in love with this DVD. I am a 30 year old mom who is in pretty good shape and I work out regularly. I am not a big yoga fan, however I am a huge Jillian fan and I wanted to try something different to mix up my usual workout routine... this ROCKED! I was not bored and definitely felt the burn. This is not a typical, ""feel the earth and breathe deeply"" sort of yoga DVD. This is a workout that will work all your muscles. Try it, you won't be disappointed!"
4,Not bad for a short workout,"I just did the Level 1 segment of this disc this morning. Having practiced Vinyasa Yoga for a while now, this was not super difficult, but still made me sweat! I like Jillian's tough sense of humor and motivation, and I do own and enjoy her other workout DVDs.I like that the pace was not overly slow, but gave a nice breakdown of the moves and with modifications if needed. It also introduced me to a couple of poses I had not tried before.All in all, the DVD itself is a bit short (when I practice yoga, I prefer to do it for at least 60 min. at a time), but I guess if you do both segments back to back, it would certainly give you a full yoga workout.I don't really care if its not 'real' yoga, as some other reviewers have complained. Its Jillian, after all, so just expect something a little different than what you are used to and have fun doing it!"
4,"Great body workout, but...","I live in Asia, so I get to do yoga a lot. I've had some amazing yoga classes in Taiwan and in Thailand. JM's yoga meltdown is a good workout, but if you do it often, you might get bored pretty soon. I take turns doing ""No more trouble zones"", ""30 days shred"" and then, ""Yoga meltdown"". These workouts are fantastic for ALL of my muscles. I feel great! I never get tired no more!!!"
3,Decent workout for 30 min,"This was decent. I definitely felt a burn (mostly in my shoulders) after the 30 minutes were up. She uses yoga moves and adds aerobic repetitions to them. It is more ""fitness tape"" than it is ""yoga"". If you are looking for a traditional yoga tape I would suggest to keep looking. She does a lot of pep talk throughout it and it is not very relaxing. There is a short warmup and short cool down and no meditation.In short, it is yoga poses (lunges, downward dog, plank, etc.) with repetitions added (going up and down from the lunge, moving your arms back and forth, lowering the leg up and down, etc.) for a more aerobic workout."
4,A softer side of Jillian,Over the past year I have grown to love yoga but I have never really liked yoga dvd's. I have Jillian's 30 Day Shred and I think it gives me a great quick workout but I was skeptical of how she would be on a yoga dvd. I was pleasantly surprised by Jillian's attitude on this dvd; she was calm and extremely encouraging. There is a little less yoga than I would like and a little more strength training moves but this would be great for someone just beginning yoga. It's a quick workout and of course there are variations of each exercise given. If you are looking for a little more movement than your normal yoga class you will really like her dvd. I love to use it as a cool down/stretch after running.
3,Decent workout but not quite yoga,"While this installment from JM is pretty near what you expect from her, I think she could have been more true to yoga. For example, instead of normal sun salutation series, she has you move (sometimes a bit awkwardly) from one move to another in order to ""rep it out"" before holding a pose to feel the burn. I find myself altering the moves a bit to make them more yoga-like. I this video ignores the fact that sun salutations can be very aerobic and challenging in favor of moves more typical to her circuit/interval style.This is a workout I turn to when I want to do a slightly more cardio-heavy yoga-based workout, but I think you can find better ""power yoga"" workouts if you want something more true to the practice (such as Rodney Yee'sPower Yoga - Total Body Workout). However, if you like Jillian and her style, you will probably be happy to add this to your collection."
2,Yoga Meltdown,"I really like Jillian Michaels' dvds in general and have several, but this one did not do it for me at all. The flow felt weird, and her voice and the music were very distracting. It just wasn't what I was personally looking for. I plan to give it another try, but overall, this is my least favorite of her work outs."
4,Butt-kicking workout,"I love yoga, but I wanted something a little harsher for a workout and this delivers! I find Jillian to be an inspiring and driving ""coach"", but if you don't like her personality as seen on the TV this isn't for you."
4,Nice Workout,"The workout is nice and a bit challenging, but I agree with other reviewers that Jillian doesn't break down the proper yoga poses and stances, and moves kinda fast between moves/poses. I still broke a sweat, but I tried my best to use correct posture and go at my own pace."
4,It was an ok video.,I'm not a big fan of Jillian Michaels in this video but it DOES work you out. She just isn't as engaging as some of the other hosts I've seen.
3,Not a true yoga workout,"This will get your heart rate up and work some muscles (though you probably won't be sore the next day) but it's short and easy enough that it kind of feels like a ""cheat"" workout. It's better than nothing for days when you're tired or pressed for time, but if you've ever practiced real yoga you'll notice the difference. Jillian doesn't claim to be a real yoga instructor and she works in her signature commentary that's familiar to loyal viewers. Don't get me wrong- I'm not into slow-moving easier yoga styles- I prefer quick-moving challenging vinyasa workouts and Jillian's style is more in this vein than, say, a relaxing Hatha practice. There's just something about it that falls a little short for me- definitely not my favorite workout DVD. For the price I can't complain, but if you're looking for something a little more comprehensive and challenging this probably isn't the workout for you."
3,Yoga Meltdown,This yoga video is great for beginers not for any other level. Any other level it is to slow and Jillian talks to much during the video.
1,Yikes....not the Jillian I know who usually delivers!,"I really, really tried to love this one as much as I do all her other workout dvd's. I stuck with it for a week and just could not do it anymore. It's horrible yoga....clearly not her strong point. It's hard to take direction and follow someone who isn't flexible and that is creating a ""Yoga"" workout that isn't quite yoga. I had to give this one 1 star because it's just not good I can honestly say I hated it. Didn't feel much either when I was finished or the following day. Usually when I start a new workout of Jillians I definitely feel it the next day as my body gets used to using new muscles. That's not the case with this one. I had to give it away as I knew I would never use it again. Not to worry her dvd's that came out post this one are definitely worth buying and using. Jillian brings it back with those but falls flat on this one."
4,Tough but Manageable Workout,"I was enjoying the toughness of 30 day shred but it was too hard on my knees so I switched to yoga meltdown. My primary concern was that it wouldn't have the same heart rate raising toughness of 30 day shred. Boy was I wrong. An added bonus is I'm fixing to travel to Belgium and I was trying to figure out how to get weights in my suitcase with everything else I have to bring. Alas, with yoga meltdown, all you really need is your body. Because I workout in my house and my workout room is carpeted with a significant amount of padding I don't use a yoga mat, hence the dolphin portion of the routine has led to some pretty nasty rugburn. After a few rounds, threw a sweatshirt under my arms and not a problem anymore. Jillian makes this yoga challenging but doable (for a beginner) and I'm excited to see what three weeks of 5 days with this routine does for me!!"
2,"Short workout, hardly yoga.","Only a 30 minute workout (each - there are 2 levels, each 30 minutes long) that moves at a very rapid pace. The exercises are taken from traditional yoga (downward dog, triangle, balancing twist) but are done in quick repetition form with a short hold at the end, making it more of an aerobic workout than true yoga. To make it even less 'yoga-like' is Jillian's way of teaching, as well as the abysmal soundtrack - I don't expect every yoga video to have a zen like eastern background track, but this is intolerably bad during some exercises. And as for Jillian, who at one point starts yelling ""Do it! Do it! Do it Baby!"" like some sort of drill instructor to one of the background cast...phew. A little distracting and annoying!"
3,Yoga not for beginners,"I bought this after reading that you can be a beginner and still be able to keep up with this. I will have to say this is more for advance people, I was only able to do it 10 minutes and couldn't do anymore. I just ordered a different DVD that is yoga for beginners and once I have mastered that I will come back to this one and try it again, so for right now I have to give it a 3 star rating because I was not able to complete the DVD but once I get more practice I will come back and give it my full rating."
3,GREAT!!,NOT A RELAX YOGA DVD!!! A great 30 min workout... do wish there were more than 2 videos other than that :D
3,not her best work,"When it comes to my workout video selection, this one is near the bottom of my stack. It really isn't my favorite. I am not gonna lie though, when I do pop this one in, I usually walk away sore. I like yoga, and I like Jillian. But together, not so much. Jillian is yoo tough, too enthusiastic for yoga. When she tries to use language that is somewhat typical to yoga practice, it sounds insincere and you know she is inwardly rolling her eyes when she says things like ""melt your heart to the sky"". It was a nice effort, and if I could stomach the yoga and Jillian combo, maybe I would do it more. But this isn't her area of expertise, and it doesn't seem to be comfortable for her, which makes it uncomfortable to watch. Like I said, from a workout standpoint, it does the job. It just isn't my favorite of hers."
3,"If you're already fit, you might want to skip this one...","I'm already pretty fit and am an ""advanced beginner"" in the yoga world. I can also get all the way through the Banish Fat/Boost Metabolism and No More Trouble Zones (both by Jillian) DVDs without much trouble so I found this workout to be not challenging enough for me. It's the one I do on days when I'm too sick or tired to do a 'real' workout but not sick or tired enough to skip one. Even level 2 is too easy once you're able to hit the crow pose. The only pose that gave me any trouble at all was the inverted push-up at the end of level 2, which I am physically incapable of doing anyway owing to a brachial plexus nerve injury, so I can only do the backbend and hold the pose. But it's not difficult. Level 2 of her Ripped in 30 is harder, and so is her new abs DVD."
3,"Not true yoga, but still a good workout","If you are looking for a ""true"" yoga dvd, this isn't it. That being said, I do enjoy this workout. Using yoga poses Jillian adds reps and then a hold method. It is a good workout and will get you sweating. However, I enjoy practicing true yoga more where it is a mind-body-spirit workout."
4,I was definitely melting,I actually bought the DVD from Costco for $7.99. Costco had all of Jillian's other exercise DVD's for $7.99 too. I like Jillian's style of teaching and this workout was pretty intense. I am doing P90x lean and on my recovery week was supposed to do the YogaX DVD twice. So I bought Yoga Meltdown and substituted one of the YogaX workouts. I did levels 1 and 2 and according to my Bodybugg I burned about the same amount of calories as YogaX. (Which is pretty good considering YogaX is 90 minutes long and if you do both levels on Yoga Meltdown it only takes an hour).
2,Not yoga,"I've been doing yoga for about a decade now and really enjoy the practice. I also enjoy all of Jillian's exercise DVD's...except for this one. Jillian does ""reps"" of traditional yoga poses. This is not only painful, but dangerous. If you want a strength training workout, then there are better videos. If you are looking for yoga, look somewhere else. I was really disappointed with this one."
2,NOT for beginners!!,"I have been taking a yogalates(yoga/Pilates) class for a month or two now and wanted some power yoga and Pilates videos to do at home. I recognized Jillian Michaels and thought I'd give this one a try. I decided to start with the beginners workout on this video since I haven't been doing yoga or Pilates for very long. I started doing the moves and it was really intense but I decided to keep going. After about 10 minutes I had to quit. She has you doing these ridiculously difficult moves with pretty quick, wide range of motion type movements(for yoga). I'm sure that someone who is pretty strong that does yoga all the time would be fine with this but for a beginner like me it just seemed kind of dangerous. It was difficult to hold my form and I was concerned about injuring myself because of that. Bottom line...newbies beware."
4,a nice new twist on yoga,"I was skeptical about trying this dvd, mainly because i have tried yoga many times in the past and just could not get into it. I am a huge fan of Jillian's other dvd's and have lost 50lbs over the past year integrating jillian's workouts into my regular exercise routine, for this reason i gave this dvd a chance and i am really glad i did. It gives a new spin on yoga using jillian's signature style of circuits. There are 2 levels and like on all her other dvds 2 girls to follow weather you would like a easier or harder versions of the moves. I would highly recommend this dvd if you are a fan of her other dvds, but if you are looking for a serious yoga dvd look elsewhere."
3,Mixed emotions,"I have mixed emotions about this DVD. I purchased the yoga dvd along with 6 week sixpack and 30 day shred. This is my least favorite and Ive only used it a couple of times. It just doesnt feel like Im getting as good of a workout as I do with the 2 other DVDs. You can tell Jillian isnt a yoga person, she even says it like a million times on the dvd. Its not really yoga, more lite power yoga (exercises inspired by yoga moves). If you are looking for a yoga dvd, dont get this one! But if you are a fan of Jillian Michaels other vidoes, go ahead an try it. You DO end up sweaty and tired, but thats not really the point of yoga. So, just very mixed emotions :)"
3,Just too difficult,"Just too difficult for me after about a year of yoga. No time to catch your breath and there is always the possibility of injury as you slam your body into pose after pose, rep after rep. For a more gentle and accessible aerobic yoga try Rodney Yee's Yoga Now, Accelerated Yoga. You'll increase your heart rate but you won't feel like you've been left behind and come away feeling winded but inadequate, as I do with this workout."
4,Jillian Michaels Yoga Meltdown,I love this workout video. It is one of her best. I'm hoping to see results but I do enjoy the workouts.
1,Not For Beginners!,I tried this workout once and really messed up my right leg it still is hurting after 3 days plus my stomach was sore the day after. The exercises are a little too fast and hard to do if your not flexible and out of shape.I think I'll exercise with my Cory Everson video instead.
1,This is not yoga,"This is a good yoga-inspired workout for weight loss. However, it is not yoga and it is most certainly NOT for yoga beginners.My concern is that people new to yoga will hurt themselves if they use this video to learn yoga. It is not a good video for learning the fundimentals of yoga. I think this video will do more harm than good if the viewer is new to yoga.Jillian Michaels and yoga do not mix."
3,"not nearly as good as shred, boost metabolism or trouble zones","it's just not very hard. there are a few moves that will get your muscles working, but overall it's disappointing. i was looking for another butt-kicking jillian workout to add into the mix, but sadly, these two yoga workouts just aren't that good."
