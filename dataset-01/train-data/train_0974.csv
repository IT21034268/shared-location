1,Save your money,"This shuffler doesn't shuffle very well. I put a new deck of cards into it and after 5 shuffles there was still a string of 10 cards in a row. Also, it doesn't really save you any time since you have to hold the button down to shuffle the cards."
1,This shuffler is not worth the money...,"I purchased this shuffler to make game night more fun, however all I got was frustration. Although the base was sturdy and the appearence pleasant, this unit did not work. Each time I tried to shuffle a deck, the cards would be dispersed from one side and not the other. I tried this several times using old and new cards with the same results. I exchanged the unit, thinking that the problem might be due to a defective unit, but the replacement was worse! The wheels turned when the button was depressed, but when you put the cards on, they did not move to be shuffled. I recommend you look for another card shuffler, this one will only leave you upset and disappointed."
2,Manfrotto 728B,"Poor quality. Leg lock broke. I ordered a new one, followed the video instruction for installation, and the new leg lock also cracked. Won't buy another Manfrotto product."
1,Utter garbage,"I didn't have much money for a tripod when I bought this. I knew of Bogen/Manfrotto's reputation for quality, so I was surprised that this broke in two places within a year after I bought it.I've used professional heads, and knew that this head would be worthless for panning (no surprises there). But the plastic snaps on the metal legs are of such poor quality, that they broke in two places. I had to rubber-band them together until I could get another (more professional) tripod. I was embarrassed to carry it around, and nervous about taking my hand off the tripod, for fear that one of the two compromised legs would give out, and cause the camera to come crashing to the ground.I was considering donating this to a thrift store, but the thrift store might be insulted that I'm giving them my garbage."
5,Great Compact Tripod,"I trusted this tripod with my Canon XHA1, and it didn't let me down. Purchased for a media fam trip to France, it fit perfectly in my camera case. Bungee cords worked well to tie the tripod down to the case when in operation in the field. Tripod setup and adjustment were fast and easy.I put this tripod through a ""professional duty"" workout, and it performed nicely, much better than the cheaper compact tripods."
5,Great Tripod for the money,I have an Olympus Evolt 500 and this tripod works fine. This is a great tripod for a $100.00. For anyone on a budget this makes a great addition to their photography equipment.
4,"Decent tripod, EXCELLENT customer service","While this is a good upgrade from the cheap plastic tripod I was used to, I'm not too impressed by its stability.The legs are good and sturdy (unless completely extended), but I'm not sure whether the slight instability comes from the integrated head or the center column.It's well built and definitely seems very durable. Size/weight is perfect for travel/carrying around. The bag it comes in is great quality.Overall - a decent entry level tripod imo.When I received the tripod, the little metal ring that's used to tighten the quick release plate on to the camera was broken. I called amazon, and they instantly shipped me a replacement tripod which reached me the very next morning. 5 stars to amazon for their excellent customer service."
4,Very good value,"I needed a reasonably decent tripod for a Canon EOS 30D with a 70-300mm zoom tele lens, but I didn't want to break the bank. I decided on this one after reading the other reviews. I am quite pleased with this item. The head operates smoothly and locks down solidly. I often use it extended to near max height. It is very stable despite that extension. This is a very good tripod for the money. I have no reservations about recommending it to others."
5,A Great Tripod,"This is a compact and stable tripod for the compact dslr user. I have used this tripod with my 70-300mm IS lens on my Canon XTI and am more then happy with it. Yes there are more professsional tripods from this company that offer more stability, but at a cost of increased weight. I use this tripod for outdoor work and when carrying my complete kit, weight is an issue, so this is a great tripod for me and the use I intended for it."
3,Awakening The Dead,"`Tombs of the Blind Dead', released in '71 was the first of writer/director Amando de Ossorio's four cult films affectionately known by its fans as `the Blind Dead'. Who will ever forget that deep, unnerving chant-like moan resonating within the ancient castle walls that precedes the appearance a the long dead group of notorious 13th century Templar Knights.Yes the production values are poor, the special effects weak and the dialogue bordering on laughable. Yet with all the negatives there is still something inordinately eerie that takes place when that moaning sound begins and the slow-motion, dirt incrusted corpses appear. It definitely creates an atmosphere not soon forgotten.If you're a fan of low budget Euro-Horror enjoy!"
3,AGHHHHHH AGHHHHHHH AGHHHHHH,The first of four(don't bother with the sequels)Spainish flicksshot by de Ossorio concering the Knights Templar:witchcraftpracticing monks who were executed centuries ago and now risefrom their mass grave as blood-drinking ghouls on horseback.Being blind(their eyes have been eaten out by crows you see)they find their victims through sound. With the slow/modirecting and the famous soundtrack(AGGHHH...AGHHHHH)you are in for a real GHOUL time(sic)
4,B Grade Kingdom!,"Besides the tauntingly slow undead (actually a feature here) and the beautiful young girls who cant escape (OK some do) because of their high heels and skimpy wear (hey, we have to get someone to watch this Elvira sponsored style flick), the undead Knights Templar have arisen! If you love B grade horror, watch this one to see some bad guys get what they deserve, and see the undead catch the soul train to town!!"
2,Noche de Nada,"I bought this film at a cut out bin at a porn store because I heard how ""great and wonderfully inventive"" it was. What a load of crust! This movie is so dull that I fell asleep each time the blind dead came out. It isn't even atmospheric. Each time the blind dead are around there's some so called ""creepy"" music that only makes it look like a monastic opera. All the women do is scream and scream some more, has anyone ever heard of matches when dealing with stinking, dumb, blind skeletons that creep alone at a snail's pace? Get real. There were three more boring sequels to this stinker."
3,Entertaining but Problematic,"I bought this to accessorize the Bobblin' Big Top Circus playset for my daughters. It's a very cute toy and they have fun playing with it, but it's also very frustrating for them. The Pablo figure that comes with it doesn't stay in place when the train is rolling and the engine and caboose constantly come apart because the hitch is unstable.Half of the time spent playing with this toy is spent putting it back together or attempting to balance Pablo on it. They now just play with it in separate pieces without Pablo which makes me somewhat regret the purchase because it's not the way it's supposed to played with."
2,Does not come with 3 bobblin' figures!,"My 2 year old son received this for Christmas, and although he is enjoying it, I'm wondering if we got an incomplete package...because the description says it comes with ""3 Bobblin Clowns Pablo Tyrone and Uniqua that dance and bobble as you roll the train along to Backyardigans music...""Ours only came with Pablo. No Tyrone or Uniqua to be had. Is this a fluke or has anyone else had this experience? Either the description is horribly inaccurate or we just need to try and return ours (which has of course, been opened!) for a complete set.Anyone out there who can share your experience with this? Thanks!"
2,"Cute train, poor design.","I bought the train to go with the Backyardigans Big Top Circus playset, the problem is the figures don't stay on the train and the two pieces of the train don't stay together - they keep coming un hooked. My toddler can put it back together by herself, but it comes right back apart. Bad design."
4,Awesome,"The DVD was brilliant! We used it at our reception, we just projected it on the walls and let people watch during the party! It was hilarious and perfect!"
4,Good shorts by nowaday unknowns,"Pleasant comedies from Charlie Chase and others, who are now relatively unknown. Shows that Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd were not the only good ones."
4,So Far So Good,"This doesn't completely avoid the peppermint-tasting acid reflux side effect, but it is less gross than other peppermint pills I've tried. In fact, it is rather mild. As for helping curtail an attack of IBS, I think it may actually be working a little. My recovery time is about 20 minutes faster."
2,Caused Acid reflux,Gave me horrible acid reflux. The previous brand I used did not cause any issues like this one did. I'm not sure the enteric capsules really work. I think it might still be releasing in the stomach.
4,Good pills,"These were good. I don't think they ever dissolved to soon, because I never experienced burning in my stomach. Did I burp peppermint? Sure, occasionally. I never did eat them regularly, so can't expound on the benefits."
5,Excellent Cutting Board !!,"I don't usually write reveiws, but I was so happy with this purchase that I wanted to write one for this item. If you are looking for a wood cutting board this is an excellent one to buy. I love the round shape and it is an awesome quality. It has rubber feet on the bottom that keep it up off the counter and the handles work great for lifting it. It has such a pretty wood grain to it that it looks nice sitting on the counter. A very solid board that will last forever. Shipping was fast even with the super saver option! A great shopping experience!"
4,"A very good, action packed, humorous manga.","Now, I can't really stand the anime...heck, I can't stand pretty much any anime, but Shaman King in it's original form totally rules. While the art isn't the best I've seen, I love it anyway (and art is always a big thing with me). The story keeps you interested, and if not that, the action scenes or the humor scenes will keep you attached. If you like the anime, this is defenetly a must, and, hey! It helped me out with my art as well, so that's a plus. Heh."
4,Great Story,"This is a good story, and I ready the manga in Shonen Jump every month. However, this series does not describe a true Shaman. A Shaman is a Native spirtual leader who uses animal spirit to heal. Search for shaman here and you'll find out more."
4,"For an inauthentic performance, very good","I cannot deny that this performance is quality, yet I find the traditional operatic approach to baroque overbearing. Heavy bel canto voices simply cannot deal with baroque coloratura and agrements, so stylistic cuts must be made. As a result of such compromises, there isn't much coloratura left. The singing is polished and competent, but too straightforward. The orchestral playing is too bombastic (which is your typical Levine). Luckily, there's Gardiner. Some day, somebody will rerecord all Mozart and Bach in an authentic style. I'm happy that there is progress, Gardiner's done a lot, Christie has just recorded Die Entfuhrung. I firmly believe that there is both a philosophical and an artistic merit in the period performance approach."
2,Why Domingo?,"I loved the performance of the italian mezzo coloratura Cecilia Bartoli but I still think Domingo ought to be in stage to perform Verdi or something else. Thanks Good we have gardiner production. This is a different kind of opera. this is ""opera seria"", this is Mozart, and even Frank Loppardo could have done a better Job in the tittle role, of course this will not seel as the record compani wishes, but musically and with the same cast is the best option. Placido must join Pavarotti and Carreras to sing in the TV party of the World Cup. Sorry Placido fans, but time passes to everyone."
4,Bible Fun,"Unlike earlier volumes in this series, Volume 9 is well edited and well composed. Most of the crosswords depend on quotations, not arcane trivia, for their clues. Puzzles are signed and unsigned in about equal number but equally well done; difficulty ranges from very easy to relatively challenging. Almost all are based on the King James version of the Bible. It is a nice little volume and provides several hours of Bible-based fun."
4,Suede Leather Purse,Well made. The problem with this item was it was smaller than antisapted and it was not red but kind of a dark-rose and black.To a woman this is a big difference if you are going for red.
4,Couldn't put it down,"I read this book in three nights. I got very little sleep that week, but it was worth it. Mr. Schrager's depiction of life on the Chicago streets could only be told by somone who had been there as he had. I'm looking forward to anything else that he writes and I hope that he does it soon. Here's hoping that they can make this book into a movie, it would be dynamite."
1,Dear Lord,"That title (""Dear Lord"") could easily apply for many movies, but few would be as deserving as King Midas. It is a terrible movie. People forget their lines, lines which weren't anywhere close to decent to begin with, production values are awful, and, perhaps worst of all, the filmakers take themselves seriously. A few highlights:-seeing the sound editor/occasional camera man get his hand placed into a meat grinder-an eight minute stripclub scene culminating in a semi-nude woman scratching herself for a good minuteAND-a man getting his leg ""blown off"" (hilarious"")"
4,Collection of short stories,"Collection of short stories about the life of a jewish boy in Canada. Some stories are more interesting than others. Overall, a pleasant read. I eaxpacted more twists, though."
4,a bit too short!,this book is really funny in a very understated way but it is way too short! (On the other hand it left you wanting more)
3,Escape From Mount Moriah,"As an enthusiast of World War II literature, I try to read a cross section of stories, written by people who have personally lived through this harrowing time. This book is based on a Jewish boy and his Mother who end up interned in Spain,far from their own homeland of France. It spans several years, written many years later, but viewed through the eyes of this child as he struggles to survive in a world tipped upside down, writing stories in his journals about the people,experiences and events taking place around him.This book is suitable for all readers and does not contain extreme descriptions or graffic wording."
5,Gil Shaham is my favourite violinist and I love his playing.,Gil has been my favourite young violinist for quite some time and I think he is just brilliant. This CD has some of the most gorgeous pieces of music ever written for the violin and he plays them all beautifully.
3,"Good exercises, but can't directly access the exercise","I guess that all these videos are done the same way - with lots of talking prior to beginning the exercises but there is no way for the user to choose the exercises only and skip all the talking. When exercising daily, it is maddening to have to fast forward to the exercises every day. Once one gets to the exercises, they are great."
4,One of the best latin rock band!!!,Victimas is one of the best band in the genere. Their music have everithing you expected from a great rock band. Oh! and you just have to see them performing live!!! They are awsome! One of the best show I ever seen.
4,energetic upbeat hardcore jumparound ROCK,winter material it's so fresco good tempo rythmic instrumentation that really gets you going. Materia Maziza buen ritmo energia dinamica para ponerle duro a los brincos.
4,Starting point for medieval Scandinavia,"Great starting reference on the subject of post-viking Scandinavian armies. The book really highlights how the earlier viking ideas impacted the development of Scandinavia armies and military tactics. It particularly highlights how Scandinavia lagged behind central Europe in its political and social structures and how this affected warfare in the region. for example the lack of a true feudal system resulted in armies remaining small and with only small and sometimes nonexistent cavalry forces. The book is not too heavy to read if you are unfamiliar with people and places at this time, but provides sufficient information for further readings. As said above, great starting point on the topic. But for someone who already knows a lot about medieval Scandinavia, this is probably not the right book for you."
5,Funny!!!!,I enjoy Katie MacAlister's books (historical romance ones) This book is easy to read and very funny. I loved it!
1,One of the absolute worst!!,"OK, let me say that I do not review many books. It would be way too time consuming considering the amount of books I read. But this book is SO AWFUL I couldn't resist. First of all, I would like to point out that I really liked Noble Intentions which is why I decided to read Harry's story. But OMG how horrible!! For one thing, In MY Kindle version, Noble is known as Lord Weston. Then in The Trouble With Harry, the author changes his name to Lord Wessex. Which is it?? Can the author not keep track of her own characters or was someone in the editing dept asleep on the job? As far as the story goes? Snorefest! So boring I could barely get through it but since I'm not one to leave a book without finishing, I had to suffer through the nonsense. Harry was NOT the strong male force we come to expect in historicals. I really don't want to read about a man who keeps pushing up his spectacles and how soft his belly is. UGH!! What trash! Please be warned! Don't waste your 99 cents."
4,I Liked It,Nobel Intentions was such a good read I thought I'd read this one since I liked Harry in the book. This was very funny at times but I will admit I didn't like it as much as NI but it was good worth more than the $.99 I paid. I don't think I've read a historical romance with a 45 and 40 year old H/h but it worked. I'll look into others by KM. Happy Reading.
5,Very Enjoyable!,"I enjoyed this book very much. It was good to see an 'older' man and woman get together...and boy do they ever get together.Harry, a Marquis, runs an ad in the local paper in search for a wife. He luckily finds Plum...and the fun begins.Harry is a character introduced in 'Noble Intentions' and his story is brought to life in this funny and enjoyable book."
2,A Flat Read,"The description of the book was very promising and after hunting for the book at a few used stores, I ordered it here. The hunt for the book built up my anticipation.I was very excited to read it (and usually I can finish a good book in one afternoon), but I found myself losing interest page to page. I became impatient with the pace of the book. The characters failed to capture my interest or admiration. Not feeling invested in the characters or outcome, I quickly lost interest in the entire book. The book fell flat and I was disappointed."
2,So so..,"It seems that I have a love hate relationship with Katie McAlister. I absolutely couldn't stand her vampire novels but on the other hand, I absolutely loved The Corset Diaries. The Trouble with Harry is very clear from the beginning - Plum. I couldn't stand the main character. She lacked consistency, at times completely self involved and delusional and at others selfless and matronly. I got no true sense of who she was because she never developed completely. I gave the book two stars because the plot was interesting, but the mystery only remains a mystery because MacAlister witholds information from the reader. The children were a bright spot, and incredibly funny. All in all not the worst book I've ever read, but I probably won't be rereading it."
3,A little boost!,"This is such a cute and (so far) durable little stool and it is great for the potty but my son (2 years)still can't reach the sink with it. If your little one just needs a little boost,or if like us, you have a small bathroomthis stool is great and easy to stash out of the way."
2,Too short and easy to tip over,"Our 2 1/2 year old daughter has always been a good height for her age (75th+ %), so we figured any kid stool would work for getting up on the potty and also reaching the sink to wash her hands. She received this Dora stool for her b'day, and it's just too short to be much help. Six months later (and noticeably taller), she still has to work to get on the potty, and reaching the sink is impossible. Also, it's very lightweight, so if she stands too close to any edge of the stool, it tends to tip over. I'm sure it's a fine stool for bigger kids, but my toddler needs a taller, sturdier boost."
3,Cute and sturdy for a child,"Cute, sturdy, and easy to carry for a child. Not sturdy for an adult. I put one foot on it and felt it start to give."
3,"Sturdy, but too narrow","While I think the stool is very sturdy, I find that it is a bit narrow. Any toddler will be facing the toilet as they approach, like my kid. My kid then steps on the stool (facing the toilet) before she pulls down her pants. She then has to turn around 180 degrees in order to sit down. The stool is quite narrow, and she sometimes loses her balances (or falls off) while trying to turn around. It's super cute, but I need to find another stool with more square footage."
4,Perfect for Potty Training,"Durable, easy to clean and pretty. I actually purchased a second one - but in my Toys R Us shop. Amazon charged me about $7 over the price at Toys R Us. But great little stool - would recommend."
5,Functional little stool.,"I purchased this so my daughter would be better able to reach the kitchen sink. The stool works great and is extremely sturdy and even mom and dad can use it. My daughter was thrilled with the Spongebob design. The only problem is it gets in the way in the kitchen sometimes, but that is no fault of the stool, and it is holding up great to getting bumped around the kitchen."
4,Works fine,"Not much can go wrong with a step stool, I suppose. This one works fine. I move it around wherever the kids want to get up a bit higher and my 3 year old can do the same."
4,"Er, wrong stool received","I am giving this product 4 stars as it works great and my boys love it. HOWEVER, I should like to point out that we ordered a RED Dora stool to match a red seat we already had. We received a PINK stool with Dora dressed as princess. Hmmm. At the time of ordering this pink stool was not even a listed option so I have no idea why we were sent this. Fortunately my boys liked it anyway so we kept it."
4,"Good, but not what I ordered...","I really loved the look of the stool when I picked it out online. When it arrived yesterday, I opened the box to find not a green and yellow stool with all of the Sesame Street characters on it, but a white and red stool with just Elmo on it. It's fine- my daughter loves Elmo and it'll look good in the bathroom, but I'm still disappointed that it's not what I expected. I've never had that happen on Amazon before :("
4,no slipping,it's just tall enough for my kid to reach the sink...which is the point of it. it does not slip on the wet floor though which is something that couldn't be said for our last step....so that's nice.
2,Flimsy. Not great for a child or potty training.,"I bought this for my 2 year old as she was toliet training to help her get on the potty and to reach the sink as she was washing her hands. It is not even high enough to reach the sink (not its fault--but it is a very low stool), so it is pretty useless for that purpose. Even at our lower sink, she still cannot use it for that. For the toliet, we have a tile floor, and the bottom of the stool is plastic with no rubber covering so the stool slides everywhere, so she cannot actually use it to climb on to the toliet. It slides everywhere and she has fallen.I gave it two stars because it is a cute stool and if you are using it for another purpurse, such as maybe a playroom or something else, it is a cute stool, but most moms I know buy these kind of things for potty training. It it NOT for that purpose. Try something with a rubberized bottom or something multilevel or higher."
3,"Beautiful singer, nice voice.",This one is not the best one of her. Average quality. She would be a better model than singer.
5,SIMPLEMENTE MARAVILLOSA,MARAVILLOSO. Esa es la palabra para definir este trabajo discografico de Millie. Nada Mas.-
5,Best Female Latin CD by far...........,"If you find yourself looking for the Luis Miguel sound (1988-2002) with a woman's voice, this is the CD to get!Wonderful songwriting and arranging make for one of the best latin ""westcoast"" style albums of all-time."
4,Great Little Flash,"I bought this flash primarilary for the auto-slave feature to use in conjunction with my digital camera. The flash is completely adjustable from the tilt to timing, allowing you to put the light where it's needed for the right shot. I would highly recommend this flash for the ""every-day"" photographer."
3,basic and dependable,It's not very adjustable nor very bright. I use 2 for fill flash or backlighting. They work well as slaves and with the small LumiQuest softbox. The shoe mount can be screwed atop your standard 1/4 in threaded light stand. Not a main flash but useful.
3,"Worked ok for a while, but now it's dead!","I bought this to be used with my old Kodak DC4800. Initially it worked well...both the hot-shoe option and the slave option (Kodak DC4800 has a hot-shoeconnector). The photos appeared better with the external flash. For some timeI did not use the DS20 and now even with a new set of batteries, I cannot turnit on. The unit is completely dead!"
2,Seemed to be working..........but not with my camera,"I bought this to use only as a slave flash for my Canon 620 digital camera (which has no hot shoe). The slave flash did fire when the camera flashed, but the camera would not pick up any of the slave's light. Apparently the slave was not in sync with my camera and its internal flash. I adjusted the camera settings for every possible shutter-curtain / synchro / flash output / red-eye combination, but had no luck. I finally got some results by switching out of the camera's automatic / program modes and into the camera's manual mode; but each different scene then required 7-8 trial shots to adjust the shutter/aperture settings. It was too much of a hassle for me. I returned the flash to Adorama for a refund.Overall, I liked its look, its bounce feature, and its price. I wasn't able to test the non-slave regular flash function....And perhaps the slave option would work with a camera different than mine."
5,David Hasselhof,"This movie is in line with David Hasselfoot's previously reviewed music efforts. His long efforts with the series ""Night Rider"" created a personea that is indescribable. Time has only served to bring into focus his unique abilities, as is evidenced in this DVD. The commentary on this disc is particularily noteworthy."
4,Great Condition! But Very Poor Shipping,"This product was exactly what I was looking for at the right price. However, the padded envelope it came in provided pretty much no support to the book and it could've easily been damaged. Also the envelope was barely sealed. It was clearly used before and my book almost slipped right out when i recieved it. What would've happened if it came with no book? Other than that good deal."
5,Another good one from Griffin,"The Triumph and the Glory may be the big war novel hit of 99, but Griffin's Brotherhood of War is hard to beat, and The Berets is one of the best of the series. I thoroughly enjoyed the insights into military life and the rock solid theme that this fine book offers. Read the entire series, I did and rate it very highly."
2,klaatu verada niktu,"I must admit, I had purchased this item on the hope it might be somethingby the band Klaatu, as it was listed under them. Anyway, it's by a band calledForehead, a more recent band with a lot heavier newer sound (it cost me hardlyanything, so no biggie). The musicianship was good, and so was the overall sound.The first couple tracks were not bad at all, but they were clearly the best of it."
3,Not the right book for this isbn,"The reviews are for a different book. The book attached to this isbn has 4 short stories by Leslie Lynn, Joan Smith, Barbara Metzger, and Jennie Gallant. Lynn's story has a Cinderella origin, Smith's is of a woman who has spent her dowry on starting a restaurant in London, Metzger's the funniest: an earl whose Christmas gifts have had the cards deliberately jumbled, and Gallant's a girl who is being pressured to marry a loathsome baron.All, of course, have a happy outcome."
5,EXCELLENT Intro. Book.,"Very informative on the different techniques for developing distributed applications. It takes you from the low-level(sockets) to the highest(agents). Unlike other books, this one actually shows you how to run the sample applications provided. Many different protocols are explained and implemented. Good job."
1,wishy washy coverage,This book cut and paste materials on the internet. It does not offer any insights or helpful hints. browsing it at a local bookstore left me with the impression that the author does NOT have any real-world experience of distributed programming. It is simply another low quality book from Manning. I hope no one will waste his/her money on it.
1,Disgraceful!,"I haven't read all of this book yet, but to be frankly honest, based on the few chapters on RMI that I read, this book is so riddled with errors, inconsistencies, non-compiling code and sloppiness that I don't know if I will read any more. Please don't use this book. Examples of shoddiness include: Page 120, ""you will need to write Naming.rebind('hostname//ArithServer:portNumber...."" WRONG!. Also, Page 115, in Java source code ""public ArithImpl(String s) throws Remote Exception {"" WRONG AGAIN! . The section on RMI callbacks? Just plain WRONG! Give me a break. How disappointing."
2,Rehash of documentions,"My primary interest in Java distributed programming and this book is mobile agents. After reading the section, I inferred that the author started reading on this a couple of weeks before he started writing this chapter. Most of content and examlples are flicked from the excellent Voyager ORB documentation. Now Voyager ORB documentation is available free from its' creators online, it is fair to rehash it and sell it as a book?"
1,Believe the bad reviews,"I bought this book for its coverage on RMI. When comparing similar books at the bookstore I simply bought the book with the most pages of coverage for RMI. Well, I made a terrible choice. I've read and reread the coverage of RMI in this book. It IS frought with errors and the coverage of the topic is shallow. Examples are presented without sufficient explanation (besides containing errors). If you want to learn RMI, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!"
5,Electrolux Aptitude Upright Vacuum,"After researching many many reviews of various brands and price ranges, we decided on the reconditioned Aptitude. Given it carried the same warrantee as a new unit for 50% + less, and given the fact that out previous Electrolux lasted over 20 years, it was a low risk venture. We couldn't find a place to view the actual item and relied upon the description given. My wife is very pleased with the purchase thus far as any negative reviews have not been a factor in our experience with the unit (people should read the instruction manuals prior to writting reviews). I am pleased because, after viewing some of the bagless units on the market, I would have had to build a garage to house the monsters. This machine fits in the space the old one occupied. You could pay a lot more money for a lot less machine.Factory-Reconditioned Electrolux EL 5010 Aptitude Upright Vacuum"
5,very happy with it,LOved the product it is all I expected. But when an unexpected problem arose I was blown away by the excellent service Thanks very much...
1,Cartoon Animation for Everyone by alan Cleave,"I bought this book back in the 1970s and it had some relevance then, but it is mostly outdated due to technology. This book is completely obsolete for those wanting to create computer animation and has almost no value for those who want to learn to draw animated characters.The book discusses the basics of creating animation cycles and making a character turn, squash and stretch, etc: all information that is easily obtained for free on the web or contained in any other good book on animation.The book uses many pages describing how to build and use a film movie camera stand.The author has nearly no drawing ability and hardly seems qualified to write a book on the subject of animation. There is a section on creating animation by making characters cut out of paper and hinged together.Save your money and buy Presten Blair's book, or (if you can afford it) ""The Illusion of Life""."
3,Good with some flaws,"Overall, I found this book was rather interesting. The writing was solid and easy to understand.However, the author made the assumption that the reader would agree with the basic premise that the biblical world was an inherently sexist society, in which women had no status. While I would agree with that, since she did not examine or support her presumtions, it made her conclusions harder to accept because she did not lay a good foundation. She does seem to presume that the reader would have more difficulty with the role of metaphor in the Bible.In essence my low rating comes from the viewpoint, that I wanted more content in the structures of sexism within ancient Israel rather than an explanation of metaphor in the Bible. I should say I was torn between giving this book three or four stars. If there was a button for three and a half, that is probably what I would have given it."
2,Very basic information -- strictly for beginners.,"If you are brand new to data warehousing and e-commerce this could be a possible starting point for you. Be cautious of the industry reviews as you may encounter some inaccuracies. A well written book, just really no new information here. If planning your own data warehouse, e-commerce or CRM applications be sure and do a lot more thorough research."
1,VERY MISLEADING TITLE - This is NOT an INTERNET Book,"The title for this book is VERY misleading. In my opinion it verges on misrepresentation. The prefix ""e-"" has a very specific meaning in the industry. The publisher and the author MUST know this. To title the book ""e-Data"" more than implies that the book discusses the internet. It is only after purchasing the book that I discovered that it is simply a general data warehousing book with NO appreciable discussion of the implications the internet has on business intelligence. I have been working in the data warehousing/business intelligence area for close to ten years now. I have never heard ""e-"" applied to anything but internet realted material. I have no problem with some one coining a new term in the industry, but it seems to me that this title is a diliberate attempt to mislead people. I would hope that amazon.com does something to make clear that this book is improperly titled."
5,Great serving pieces,"I was looking for some pretty serving spoons because the only spoons I have are either really big to serve something like chili with, or really small teaspoons. The two larger pieces are great for serving vegetables or sauces and gravies, and the smaller spoon makes a great sugar spoon or chutney spoon. They're quite pretty without being overstated."
2,made in China,"I was very disappointed when this arrived because the box said ""made in China"". The item was described it as a German flatware. No where did it state that the product was made in China. I will not buy products made in China so....I returned it."
3,"5 star Material, 3 star sound","I would agree completely with the reviewer below, this Gold Cd does not compare with the disc from the Capitol Years set, there is significant loss of high end resulting in a very muted flat sounding disc, rather like an old vinyl Lp copy."
5,Total and perfect..,"Her voice was at its ultimate perfection by this album. Transition was sort of the name of the game though. What was Linda to do? Country, Rock and roll or serenade us with love ballads. We didn't care did we..? She hit it on all cylinders. This was Linda's ""Abbey Road"" album. It all came together on this one release. She had later albums that slammed it home but Heart Like A Wheel was the perfect storm of Linda's music. Not to mention that Lindas album covers, including this one, were dripping full of sensuality and sexiness that kept us young boys glued to our speakers and the album covers.."
5,THIS IS A GREAT RECORD,This album sounds as beautiful today as when it was first released in 1974. Linda's voice is hauntingly lovely and powerful.
4,Linda Ronstadt's first #1 album,"YOU'RE NO GOOD,the #1 smash from this album is probably what made the album a #1 smash. There was only one other Top 20 hit,a cover of the Everly Brothers' WHEN WILL I BE LOVED. YNG came to the attention of Van Halen around 1978 and the band decided to cover the tune. The other songs are good. Linda Ronstadt's Asylum Records labelmate Andrew Gold plays guitar and sings background on YNG."
4,Classically Entertaining !,"Great and relaxing, but since this is an older video it is particularly not his best. Tuscany is by far better and much more enjoyable!!!"
2,La Vie Est Belle,Bought this recently. Thought I was buying full concert but it contains only selections from concert. It's only 59 minutes long and the selection of music is awful. CD version has a much better selection of music.
2,not complete programe,stopped at bolero glen miller and andre sisters not included wanted these why bought 2 waste money not amazons usual efficeny disapointmentey a number of people bought this dvd made the same comments on your site has made people suspect of over production of the same music on excessive dvds we are a fan of andre but enought is enought
1,I don't have it,The producto never come. I don't have it and the say nothing about it. I request for a explanation.
5,Incredible Album,"This recording of Shubert's Songs Without Words is stunning. The music is rarely heard and deserves a much wider audience. The lyricism, the execution, and the pure pleasure you will hear on this album are unsurpassed in the romantic repertoire. I generaly prefer vocal music; the cello does all the voice can do and more in this recording."
4,Go for the Arpeggione Sonata!,"I bought it after hearing the deeply moving performance of the Arpeggione Sonata (5 stars). Not for the songs without words (3 stars), though they make pleasant listening. The cello lacks the liveliness of the voice and tended to make the songs overly sentimental, rather like hotel lounge music. The originals are to be preferred, unless you have an aversion to singers. But if you are looking for high quality hotel lounge music instead of Schubert, here it is (5 stars for that!)!"
3,sing a little song for me,"Substituting the cello for voice in Schubert's songs may have been an enticing idea, but for me one that fell flat on too many of his nursery rhyme simple songs that would have benefited from a nuanced and inflected voice - and for heaven's sake, in this day and age of advanced editing, production, and mastering, must we put up with the non-musical bow scraping so evident without an obscuring orchestra throughout this recording? The Arpeggione Sonata is great fun...the dancing tunes remind one of Viennese naked drunken frolickers...or maybe not."
3,Heavily edited translation,"This translation cuts out most of the meat of the original work (entire paragraphs, and, oddly enough, all the references to scripture), and tries too hard to put what's left of it in terms that modern born-again Christians will be happier with. There are some older translations available on the net, and in places comparing this to them looks like there are two completely different books."
3,The Spiritual Guide,I find the writings of Michael Molinos to be very encouraging for reaching a depth in Christ by the seeking heart.
3,Jari Love's revved to the max.,"The workout had a lot of potential, however there were far too many repetitions in some of the moves. Not only is this dangerousbut quite boring. My favourite Jari workouts are the ones which combine cardio with strength. It is more time efficient and the workouts are more enjoyable as the body and brain enjoy the variety."
2,bummed out,"i bought the mag 2000 and it broke down before i even had the chance to wear the paint off it. then i had it fixed and again before i even a chance to use it,it broke again,this time i bought a new one so far so good"
2,So much confusion,"Mumbo Jumbo is book that can be explained in one word...confusing! The intent was good, trying to show how African American culture came to the United States, and how different cultures reacted to it. If you are lucky, you will take much away from reading this. If not, you will be overwhelmed with a wide variety of characters with strage names. Much of this novel is lacking punctuation, which is confusing in itself. If you can read the book and understand it, it may not be all that bad, but for the rest of us, I think we would all agree we could do without torturing ourselves trying to figure it out. However, if you're up for a challenge, this is the book for you."
5,A soothing escape to a tropical paradise,"The title says it all. It is an experience of music from another culture which in my mind is associated with a tropical paradise which I imagine existed prior to Dutch colonialism of now present day Indonesia. The gamelan orchestra consists of various sizes of suspended metallophones (percussion instruments with tuned metal bars), small bulbed gongs, large suspended gongs, and drums. With the soft gentle percussive nature of the music, the experience that I get from it is an expression of the slower tranquilizing rhythms of nature. This album is well worth the $9.98 for anyone looking to explore other realms of music."
5,cargo liner,Exactly what I wanted. Very pleased. Had same type of liner for my old Ford Explorer and was happy with it.
5,Great book and excellent quality,"Bought this book used in very good condition, and it is just exactly that. The book itself is great about Shah Rukh Khan, and I am pleased very much with the quality of it."
1,Lots of install problems here,"Purchased in Aug 2005 - CDs and documentation claim support for XP - installed, but won't launch; when you to the IMSI webpage for support - this doesn't show as a product supported - so I assume it is discontinued? Can't recommend."
2,Good lyrics...,"...and definately not ""old style"" Edwin McCain. Only ""Losing Tonight"" is remeniscent. Seems he's trying to break out of a mold but loosing that old attraction a bit."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"First, let me say that I am a huge Edwin fan, and have been so since I first heard Solitude. I've been to about 10 shows and have every CD. Having said that, this CD isn't really doing it for me. It doesn't have the same Bluesy, soul, southern rock feel that most of their other work has had. To me, it'a more of a rock CD, verging, at times, on being very heavy. I still plan on seeing Edwin here in KC,MO on 5/9, but probably won't be looking forward to hearing too many songs off this disc. Hopefully with the next CD, Edwin and the guys will get back to their roots."
5,Quality Music from a great band,Great cd....Great band...They have been making quality music for years. See them live if you get the chance. Buy the cd. Support one of finest bands still working hard and making great music.
5,Great!!!,"Love this CD!!! Every song on it is fantastic, you won't hit the skip button once, I promise!!!"
5,a mighty album,"This is a grand CD. Of course, the title song is the best. But there are many other memorable and wonderful songs here. The band really shines, and the songwriting does too. Buy it. You won't be dissapointed."
4,hopefully the legend doesn't die here,"wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this film so it really caught me by surprise when it ended up being pretty darn good! the movie is pretty much a gunslinging western with a small mix of the supernatural. an evil group of men take a small town over and a supernatural gunslinger has to come in to take back the town and take out the bad guys. might not sound like much but the acting was real good, plot was pretty good and of course nothin like a good western with plenty of people being shot up and some good gun battling scenes. definitely recommend this movie"
4,Informative account of SF History re: prostitution,This book makes a unique contribution to documentation of prostitution and Chinese immigration in the 19th century. This highly readable work discusses the adverse conditions for women in the brothels as well as social/legislative response to the brothels and red light districts.
2,Too easy when compared to the actual ATS-W,"I bought this and the Kaplan versions to prepare for the ATS-W, because I already passed the LAST. My friend suggested the Barron's version to me, but maybe she had a different version because this did not help me at all. The questions were based on definitions, while the actual test was mostly common sense. The part which I found the most alarming, is that this book did not provide an example of an essay, and just told you to consult your professor/teacher, and ask him to rate your essay. Maybe the LAST preparation is worth the buy, but not the ATS-W, because I studied, and I doubt I passed the test."
4,good review book,i have found this book a good prep for the LAST and ATS-W. The questions and format of the book resemble the ones you get on the actual test. I found it especially helpful for the ATS-W because the book reviews key theories on educational psych. Overall a very good book to study from.
2,Lindsay,"Don't buy this book if you are looking for a practice test for the LAST. The test questions in this book were nothing like the ones on the test. The LAST is basically a reading comprehension test. While it does test different subject areas, all the information you need to answer the questions is generally found in the text provided. The Barron's book aknowledges this yet has several questions that expect you to have have specific previous knowledge to answer the questions.Do buy this book if you want a quick review of the different subjuect areas. The book provides information to help you brush up on the different content areas. I didn't find this type of review especially necessary for the test."
3,not for the LAST!,"Despite the annoying repeated grammatical errors in this book, it does a nice job preparing you for the ATS-W and reviewing educational subject matter; however, the questions in this book made me worry obsessively about the LAST. When I took the test, it was MUCH easier than what this book made it out to be. My advice: use common sense to get you through the LAST, but buy this for the ATS-W."
3,Works great on white paper but refuses to print on color stock,"We needed a tabloid size printer to replace our old HP 1120C and 1220C. This printer seemed to be the obvious choice. We received this about 3 weeks ago and have been fighting with it ever since. While it works great on white paper, we could not get it to function AT ALL with colored paper; not even with bright yellow paper. The printer never even attempts to print; it simply reports a paper jam error. Finally we called HP and were told (after an hour), that this printer is not compatible with color paper. Nowhere on the HP site does it mention this minor detail! Since color paper is our main use for this printer we requested a replacement. After over two hours on the phone, HP did agree to upgrade us (at some cost) to the 2800 printer. I hope that one will work!"
1,Crooked feeder,"HP's Officejet Pro K850 Printer feeds paper crooked. It also has quite a thirst for ink.If you print your own graphics, or photographs, I recommend the Epson Stylus Photo R1800. It is capable of handling thick paper stock, and prints beautifully (Make sure you have the right print/paper settings).For one that is a little more affordable, I've heard the Epson Stylus R800is also great."
2,Not a Quality Product,"I purchased this printer in 2007 and had to replace it in less than 1 year. This printer continues to show a light to replace printer heads and ink. Even when replacing, the lights would continually show. This is after 6 months of light use. I followed all recommendations by HP to resolve this issue to no avail. I gave up and purchased a new printer. I would not recommend this product as there are better products out there for a lower price point and lower total cost of ownership."
1,Poor quality,All in all I was able to print less than 1000 pages on this before the print heads completely failed and the ink cartridges dried up. Part of the reason I printed so little was because the pages were always a little askew so I would usually just print things elsewhere. Since the heads and cartridges will cost $200 to replace I am going to just throw the thing away.
2,Not the book I was looking for,"I bought this book trying to help my kid with pre-algebra and was quite disappointed. This book is not very well organized, there is no clear boundary between different sections, it's hard to separate concepts from excercises."
1,Used Book,"This book was listed as ""In good condition"", however the book that we received was in fair/maybe poor condition. The book had many written marks in both pen and ink!!! The other items that we purchased were satisfactory. We just feel that the condition listed was misleading."
1,Tarnishes really easily,"I got this as a gift for my boyfriend who is a big giants fan and he was really excited. We put on his car and it looked pretty good next to his silver trimmed accents. Not the best match, but we were ok with it. About a week or two of use and the whole thing turned black! the worst thing about it is his car is black so you can't even see it that well if you didn't mind the black :( disappointing"
4,Good for the price,Not as chrome looking as I would have liked. But I was under $7.00 so not too bad.
5,Extraordinarily genuine book,"I heard Chief Peter John speak when i was in Alaska -- to a ""potlatch"" in the prison (Fairbanks Correctional Center) People came thousands of miles to meet with him (he was ""Traditional First Chief"", region-wide, of the Athabascan Indians and still lived in his village). The book is extraordinarily genuine, his personal account of life with God, at least one vision granted him -- the story of his moose-hunting trip, complaining to the Holy Spirit about the non-fulfillment of the prophecy of food when his family was on the edge of starvation -- and IMMEDIATE answer! -- that story is worth the price of the book."
5,Amazingly accurate,"The predictions he makes in this book are so right dead on. And the ones from the beginning of the year that he wrote in 2004 are easily checked on. Just in the past two months - the hurricanes, the earthquake in Pakistan - they are in this book.Too bad more people don't pay attention."
5,Right on the money,PEOPLE SHOULD BE OPEN MINDED AND LET THOSE THAT WANT TO GUIDE US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION GO ABOUT THEIR MISSION.DR. TURI IS ALWAYS ACCURATE WITH HIS PREDICTIONS AND THAT CERTAINLY BOTHERS THOSE JEALOUS OF HIS GIFTS.KEEP IT UP DR.TURI.
5,The Seminal Book on Correctional Administration,"John DiIulio's seminal work on correctional administration is timeless, and it is just as relevant today as it was when it was written in the late 1980s. Governing Prisons continues to be an excellent text for graduate courses in criminal justice and business administration. Too, it should be required reading for prison administrators."
4,Governing Prisons,Interesting look into the prison systems within three different states in three different geographic areas. Marked similarities in their approaches as well as where they found their own varisions to approach the over-crowding as well common prison management issues.
2,Too Literary for the Living,"The stories chosen for this book are deadly boring, with one exception. Of all the stories ofMaupassant from Madame Fifi to The Diary of a Madman, he has chosen a precious bit of descriptivebanality called Menuet. It depends on your taste. This book made me yawn."
2,"Voltaire, who cares?","When I was in college I was fluent in French. I have lost some of that ease in the ensuing years, but can still read French. I decided to get some dual-language books to polish up my reading skills. I discovered however, that I can read and understand Voltaire, but really don't enjoy the stories. Perhaps a book with more current literature would have been better."
3,French Stories / Contes Francais - Wallace Fowlie,"This is a good reader for students who have taken 2-3 years of French. I wouldn't recommend it for first year students, however: the stories, though well chosen, are long and full of more advanced vocabulary words. The parallel English translation is good and would help some, though."
2,Perversion,"The translations needlessly deviate from the French, idiomatically and semantically and stylistly and syntactically, and the selection indicates a weird religious bent. So, as a teaching tool, this book best serves intermediate students of French, persons who can recognize the deviations. It could derail the progress of beginners."
4,Pretty Awesome,"Well, this book was pretty darn good. The pictures were fantastic, and I really liked it that they had some synposises for episodes that hadn't been aired yet on US TV. But then again, there were some mistakes with grammar, and names... Mispelling the japanese and the american names, and constantly switching between the two, which became somewhat confusing. Anwyay, it's a great book, especially if you're just looking for basic info and cool pictures."
4,A Really Fun And Informative Book,"This is the best book you can get for information on Sailor Venus... Except one thing..... All of the Scout Guides are the same in the way that they make all the scouts un-modest! I know it sounds rediculous, but really, it's highly unrelistic and that's one thing they need to change. They are all like ""Yes, and I'm beautifull and thin and long legged and I have the most wonderfull body!"" Really! They all sound like clones! But besides that, these are great Sailor Moon books, that yu've just got to have if your a fan....-Enjoy"
3,You like screen-shots?,"First of all, I have to say that there are alot of pictures in here, though it wasn't quite what I thought it would be. Most of the pictures were screen-shots with captions under them. Another thing I found about this book was that they kept changing Usagi's name from Bunny to Serena and back again. And for the Jupiter's Top 5 Episodes and transformation/attack sequences, it's hard to figure out which picture comes first, unless you know the episodes/transformation/attack by heart - even then, it's very confusing. Other than these few things, this book is alright, but it could have been done much better."
5,I LOVE THIS!!!,"This book is a very good book. It really explains how Yugi became friends with Tisten and Joey. If you've been watching the TV series you may be a little confused when you first read this. It explains more in depth about how Yugi came into pocession of the Millenium Puzzle, and really gives you a basic idea about this series. It is rated T for teens because of the violence in it. I would suggest this for kids 12 and over. They swear in the first book and it gets better in the second book. I HIGHLY recomend it to people it really gives you a good idea of the orgin of Yugi and his friends. This series ROCKS!!!!! PLEASE give it a try!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,This ain't no cartoon...,"The ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" Manga series kicks off, and this is Yu-Gi-Oh like you've never seen it before! When Yugi solves the ancient Millenium Puzzle, he is possessed by the ancient King of Games, and transformed into an avenging spirit, whose purpose is to challenge and punish sinners who ""trespass on the souls"" of him and his friends - and such people won't get off very easily! Experience Yugi and his friends in a whole new light, but be warned... this ain't no cartoon..."
5,5 Stars for Transformations,"Transformations is probably one of the best volumes of the GTO anime series. Once again Onizuka has done it again with his great instincts and humor. Transformations places the spotlight on the hateful Aizawa Miyabi. Portrayed as a ""princess-like"" student with an evil side, she is not one to mess around with. Unfortunately, she has met her match with the Great Teacher Onizuka. Pick up Transformations as soon as possible. Trust me, you wont regret it."
4,Pfaltzcraft earthenware,"The piece of earthenware is quite attractive, however the ""how to handle and care for"" advises the owner that the piece should be handled rather delicately; that is, never submerged in water and, contrary to the info on your site, the piece should never be used in the Microwave. Some info buyers might be interested in knowing before purchasing. I contacted the manufacturer and was told they have no control or input into what info you include. That seems highly unlikely. Joan McIntosh"
4,New York Dolls - One Day It Will Please Us...,"You don't have to be a Dolls fan to appreciate this first studio album in over 30 years...but it helps a little. There are a few songs that are just so-so, but there are also some that are downright excellent. ""Plenty of Music"" and ""Take a Good Look..."" stand out to me as great songs - not just great songs for a band that's been on the shelf for so long. David Johansen's voice is noticeably older sounding than it was on the 70's Dolls LPs, but it really fits the songs they've written here. This is a really good effort - fun, dirty rock n' roll music, just like they did it back then."
1,"""Siempre Awful"" is more like it.","Has anyone noticed that all these Jimmy Gonzalez albums sound exactly alike? You have to listen very carefully or you might think the entire CD is just one big long song. Every one of these cumbias on every album is the same: Jimmy sings a few verses in a weak voice that needs to be enhanced to sound like a robot, then some chick sings a few verses at the end. He has about as much talent as Latoya Jackson. Great music is suitable either for dancing or love-making, and you couldn't do either with Jimmy Gonzalez on the mic. It's too bad Joe Lopez dumped him."
4,Critical!,"Thank god this book resurfaced in the 70's... had it not, a treasure would have certainly been lost."
1,Nearly Worthless,"This DVD is called ""Rules & Regulations"" but very little time is actually spent covering the Rules. Most of the content is fluff. For example, a listing of who won the LL World Series every year of the 1990s. There is also a sappy history of LL. There is a LOT of content completely unrelated to Rules and Regulations. Now, to be fair, the cover does say (at the very bottom) ""Also includes the history of LLBB."" But when the title is ""Rules & Regulations"" one would expect that most of the DVD would cover Rules and Regulations. But here is the real kicker: they got a key rule wrong. In the DVD it states that head first sliding is allowed when advancing, In fact, the runner is out he/she slides head first while advancing (rule 7.07a). You'd think with such superficial coverage of the rules they could have at least checked with the rule book. Frankly, this product is poorly done and falsely advertised. Save your money."
3,HTPC Concern,"Definitely a good power supply based on the specs. It also is very quiet which is great! I ran into 2 issues when installing it last night.The 20/24 pin motherboard connector is a little odd. You have to bend the wire all the way to the left to get the 4 pin add-on to lock in place. This was a little odd, and you probably want to tie this cable in that position so those 4 pins do not work there way out of the connection.Second item was the SATA power connection. There is one cable for 2 SATA devices. Unfortunately the two connectors are only 3 inches apart. This is a problem for building an HTPC system, where the SATA hard disk is not right below my SATA DVD drive. Not an issue if you are using a regular DVD/CD drive."
1,Not for modern systems with more than 2 SATA devices,"There are only 2 SATA power connectors and they are on the same lead about 3"" apart.Fairly useless in a modern computer unless you have molex to SATA adapters.Also, since it has two fans, one in front and one in back, it is deeper than most power supplies of this wattage. I could not fit this into a Thermaltake Soprano case without having to remove components(replacing a bad power supply). Ended up using a different PS for this case, Corsair CX430."
1,Both SATA Power Connectors break immediately upon installation,"Just picked a TR2/430W power supply at a local store today to replace the faulty 5-year-old power supply in my Thermaltake enclosure. I was happy to see a dedicated SATA power cable with two SATA power connectors. However, the happiness didn't last long as the thin, brittle plastic wall on each SATA power connector broke immediately upon first attempt to install it. I subsequently picked the pieces that broke off, and found that the thing black plastic of which they are made breaks immediately upon any attempt to bend them even ever so slightly. I had to revert to my old SATA power adapter that I was using with the old power supply. Very disappointing!"
4,Workhorse,"Nothing to worry about this power supply unit. It is a real workhorse, without noise and better performance than the original."
4,What'd you expect really.,"I was happy with everything because you can't really complicate anything. Personally for me, there was only 2 Sata connectors on one cord which was like at most 3 inches apart. I can't plug in both my Hard Drive + CD/Dvd Drive now becuase they're too far apart. Not that I even use my CD/Dvd Drive, but it was nice. Other than that, you really get what you're expecting."
4,Good Value,"I bought this to replace my stock 250w PSU in a Compaq SR5333wm I bought 3 years ago so I could upgrade from my integrated graphics.Even with 2 fans, it is just as quiet as the stock PSU.One thing I did not like is how the 2 SATA connectors are pigtailed with about 4 inches between them, in no way could I use them to power both my HDD and my DvD burner. However I did not need to use them as the previous PSU only had 4pin molex connectors and used adapters.I can not rate reliability because I just installed the PSU, but judging by the quality it should be like anything else, keep it clean and do not max it out and it should last for years."
4,Power Supply,"Worked great in ATX Form factor machine except cabling did not have SATA connector for DVD drive. It had a legacy connector (Molex), I had to cut it off and splice in old SATA connector from old power supply"
1,Beware -- Product shipped is not as listed on website,"Undoubtedly, this is a good power supply. Unfortunately, the one Amazon shipped is not what is described. In particular, it is listed as 5.9 x 5.5 x 3.4 inches; it is not, it is 6.25 x 5.5 x 3.4 inches. It therefore does not fit my case. I am sending it back.Although this may be a good power supply, as indicated by the other reviews, I have rated it a ""one"" because it does not fulfill my needs."
5,Great inexpensive power supply!,"I installed this PS in my Dell 8300. Had to cut away some of the sheet metal so that I could expose the power switch but other wise install was straight forward. There are a bunch of cables and connectors for all sorts of accessories and can potentially crowd your PC but otherwise it's fine. Runs quietly, in fact, much quieter than the stock unit. For the price I paid it's hard to complain!"
4,Good PSU,"Bought two of these as replacement units after the old power supplies gave up the ghost. This unit has a nice look to it and the cables are in sleeves promoting good airflow in the case. The two fans in this model do make it a bit noisy, hence the 4-start rating.Unless you are bothered by fan noise I would recommend this PSU to you."
4,Thermaltake takes it!,"Bought the W0070RUC as a replacement for the 400W PS that died in my SOYO Dragon K600. Easy install, running quietly going on 4 weeks now, no problems. The BIOS in this setup keeps continuous power unless unplugged (probably contributed to the death of the OEM PS), will update this review accordingly. Like other reviews state, the SATA connectors are limited in length, however did not affect my install. If you have two SATA devices, be forewarned! So far the only reason it is not 5 star."
2,KABOOM!,"This power supply fried two of my motherboards. It is quiet though. If you're building your own computer, you're probably trying to make it good...if so stay away from this power supply. However, if you're building a computer for a friend that you despise...go ahead and buy it! It'll work for a couple of weeks before it fries it. ;)"
5,Great power supply!,"Great power supply! This power supply works great, so far. The only minor hiccup during the install was cutting out a space for the power switch, which the old Dell PSU did not have. But I pretty much knew that it'd be necessary, thanks to a prior review. This was purchased for and installed in a Dell Dimension 8400."
1,Thermaltake (in general) sucks!,"I am so glad for everyone that loves these power supplies, but my experience has been completely contrary. In fact, I installed my first Thermaltake PS about a year ago... it failed 6 weeks ago. After fighting with Customer Support to get this exchanged, because they INSIST on having the original receipt inspite of their 3 year warranty -- I even registered the *#@*(&% thing with them when I bought it! Finally gave up and ordered another ThermalTake because I knew it fit and worked with my system... and guess what... this one arrived DOA! I'm sorry, I like a good deal like the next guy, but a good deal consists of value for my money... right all they have is my money and I am sending this one back for a REFUND! Still stuck with my previously dead PS... DO YOURSELF A FAVOR... SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!!!"
2,Too many Molex Connections,I was shocked that this PSU on had 1 connection for an ATA drive. Was it designed in 2003?
1,Piece of junk for the money,Terrible Power Supply. Before I got my computer set up i plug both SATA power cables in and they both break. Also this thing barley ran at all of the two minutes I got out of it.
2,Cheap Chinese stuff,"Cheap stuff made in China. What would you expect!!Out of 9 molex connectors, 6 work. The rest 3 are defective.Too much trouble to send it back, but this is my last Thermaltake."
3,So far - so good,"The price was right and the delivery timely.It has been working (quietly I might add :-) for nearly a month now (18Feb2009). It is probably deserving of more/less stars, but only time will tell which..."
3,Just a cheap basic power supply,Looked like a solid piece from the pictures. I had hoped to upgrade to a better power supply for my system. This is just a very basic power supply. I'm sure it works but would not put it in my system. It is now on a shelf. The one that came with my bare bones box is far superior in construction. I will be more careful next time.
3,Only 2 SATA connectors???,It has only 2 SATA power connectors on one power cord which makes it very difficult to connect twoSATA devices.
5,Dell 8200 guy was right!,"Power supply is quite, and works perfectly with a Dell Dimension 8200. No problems at all. I had to upgrade because I went for a high end graphics card that required more power. Great product at a perfect price."
1,May not be suitable for most....,"This PSU is larger than normal. It is hard to fit in a case. I am glad I took measurements before buying. This almost did not fit into my case at all, but I adjusted a few things and shoved it in. It took a lot of force and effort to get this unit installed.Once running, the PSU is fairly quiet, and it is not noticeable at all, because the processor's fan makes way more noise by comparison. Still, my system is fairly quite, and I love it.This PSU is good, but I recommend getting more power when possible to avoid issues with video cards and an excess of devices.UPDATE: The PSU burnt out. It has an odor now, and the PC no longer turns on, and it did this while the PC was in suspend mode. I strongly recommend staying away from this PSU."
3,"OK power supply, cheap material","It's a OK power supply. Price is good.The molex connectors are made of poor material, not solid at all.It's not modular. If you put it in a small case, unused cableswill cram the interior."
5,No complaints.,I bought this a long time ago and never reviewed it. So here's my review: it works. That's all you need to know. Either it's going to work or it's not going to work. And it works.
2,SATA connectors broke on install,"This was a company I had heard good things about.The power supply itself functions well. It has been in service in a poor mans gaming computer for over a year. However upon upgrading both of the sata connectors broke. Just the pull of the cable against the connector had the thin top side (without the notch) snap off. OK! must have done something wrong with that one, no matter I'll be extra careful with this one....no... that just broke too....wth...IF you get this and you need sata connectors, factor in the cost of buying molex to sata converters because the stock ones WILL fail you no matter how gently you treat them. the plastic is about as thick as 5 sheets of printer paper stacked. I AM NOT EXAGGERATING ONE BIT ON THIS POINT. 5 SHEETS!"
4,Works fine - great replacement for old lower wattage supply,"Used this to replace the power supply on 5 year old computer. It was cheaper than replacing the dinosaur. Installed fine. All the screw-holes lined up, the power connections were all there and it started up perfectly."
3,"Quiet? I think not, after a few months.","I bought this PS to replace the one in my HP box, and was quite impressed with how well it kept the unit cool, and how quite the fans were, even when the unit got warmed up from gaming, watching movies, etc. Then last month, one of the fans started ""growling"" when I first turned the PC on. After 5 or 6 minutes, as soon as the fan warms up, the noise quietened down to a normal level. I checked to make sure nothing got sucked in there, and that there wasn't a bunch of dust on the grate or fan, and it was clean and clear of obstruction. Needless to say, I am disappointed in the quality of this power supply."
1,defective,"Unit would not power on(made a short humming sound when switched on), called Thermaltake support and their first suggestion was to send unit to them for repair/replacement (I had the unit for all of 30 minutes at this point). When I told them it would be easier for me to return to Amazon the tech began instructing me on how to ""short-out"" different connectors with a paper clip in order to ""test"" the unit! Buy at your own risk."
3,don't,do it yourself repair became a new computer after few years. Good to have the knowledge. Easy to install once you look at the old one.
5,Super Power Supply,"I bought this power supply after my video card died due to excessive heat in the case. My original 300W unit was being overtaxed, and I should have realized that something was wrong because whenever I placed my hand on the front panel of the PC where the hard drives were installed, it was HOT! The Thermaltake not only offered greater electrical capacity, but also possessed an additional fan to cool the interior. Now, when I touch the front panel, it always feels like room temperature. I've had the new power supply since July, and it has worked flawlessly since installation. The two fans are amazingly quiet. Installation was a snap, with more than enough connectors to support any configuration. For the price, I don't think I could have done better."
2,Thirteen Months and Dying,"Normally any equipment that quits working within three years deserves one star, but I give one out of charity and cheapness of the product. But in the end, you get what you pay for. I would not expect to power any video card produced within the last 5 years if not longer. It will tire out apparently.Specifically I used it only occasionally with a geforce 8800GTS video card. So in a way, thirteen months is not long. Especially since only Civilization V and City of Heroes was played on it. The former for a couple weeks, the latter for two months. Outside of this period, there was no heavy strain on the PSU at all.I've learned the hard way that one should overshoot their power supply needs, rather than try to save a buck."
5,ThermalTake made it again,"This is an inexpensive PSU, i have it working for 6 months without any problems."
2,Unit was DOA,"I was very impressed with the build quality of this PSU. Unfortunately, the one I received did not work. I was building a new system and originally thought the new motherboard was DOA. After confirming it was indeed the Thermaltake 430W PSU that was non-functioning, I returned it. I give Amazon.com an A+ for their return policy. In the end, I decided to buy another brand at a local BestBuy store."
5,very satisfied with this purchase,I am a big fan of these power supplies. Very quite and reliable. My 4th one already and never failed me once.
4,Thermaltake Power,"Installed this power supply, So far so good. Nice and quite even with the 2 fans that it has. Great price. Easy to install and has plenty of power. Hope it last longer than the original power supply that came with my HP PC 2 years ago. May have to install another one in my other PC real soon."
2,unreliable,"The book has many weaknesses. Descartes' mysticism is not well documented. He suggests that Descartes' work on polyhedrals is motivated by biblical numerology (p. 215), but then a few pages later reverses his claim, and says that Descartes didn't have numerological motivations afterall(pg. 219). He has some interesting information on Descartes and Rosicrucianism, but the question is not throughly explored.Also the book doesn't document its sources well. Its not a scholarly book for that reason. Much of the information/dialogue is based on Aczel's reading of biographer/hagiographer Adrien Baillet. There is reason to question Baillet as a source mainly because he wrote the biography 43 years after Descartes' death. Someone like Rodis-Lewis or Gaukroger wouldn't use Baillet so casually as a source."
3,A title that's a bit misleading...,"My only beef with this book is that the title is misleading. The first 200+ (out of 245 or so) are about Descartes' life and not really about the ""secret notebook"". At the end, finally, the subject is this secret notebook. I did enjoy the book, mostly because I didn't know much about Descartes' life, but if anyone is familiar with Descartes they will be disappointed with this book."
3,Much ado about very little,"I can't understand reviewers who hype this book, since there's very little information about the secret notebook, Descartes's contributions, and the persecution by the Catholic church. Granted, it's very hard to piece together facts about his life and the notebook, but there's too many small barely-related facts about who went where and maybe met with someone."
1,"Misleading, inaccurate, dishonest; good *fiction*","I can only corroborate what other 1-star reviewers have said. Under no circumstances read this book as a historical account of Descartes' life or adventures.The real problem here is that there is just enough truth to make the fiction seem real. You read it, and two years later forget which tidbits about Descartes you've learned from academic resources and which pieces have attached to your memory from rubbish like this.I hope one day the author re-writes this book replacing Descartes with a fictional character. It's a great and intriguing read - but a terribly falsity with respect to history.I also agree with others that exists at least one fake review here."
5,The Pathway Of Roses,"I have the hardback copy of this book, an Absolute Must Have. Christian D. Larson was a human being of wonderful enlightenment and I find his words to be truly enchanting. I recommend this book with Highest Regard, a treasure indeed!"
1,Not worth the money.,"I bought 2 packs of this wanting to child-proof my home. I couldn't figure out how to attach it to drawers or cabinets and neither could my husband, my uncle, or my dad. So they're still sitting in a drawer, not being used. Complete waste of money!"
2,Not worth it,"These locks did not install quickly, my husband had a difficult time aligning the separate pieces in a way that allowed the magnets to operate properly. One of the drawers won't close unless I press hard on the direct spot where the lock is located. Another issue is the magnet 'key' which I wouldn't have known to order had I not read it in a previous review. If you don't order the four pack of locks you must order the key separately! Overall, a lot of fuss and we end up leaving them unlocked because they are a nuisance."
3,Broke within days...probably good for under 12-14 month olds,"I installed 8 of these initially and within 2 days, my 16 month old girl had broken one. There was just enough play in the lock to allow enough momentum for her to swing it and break the lock catch completely off. My girl is in the lower 20% of her weight class (according to the pediatrician) so this was a bit of a surprise at how easily this was done once she figured it out. At that point, she thought it was a game and made it her goal to break the others off! haha! I believe this is a good product for under 12-14 month old children, but any older, you may want to invest in something more sturdy or try some sort of strap system rather than a clip-lock system. I gave this product 3-stars because it does seem like it would work with smaller/younger children, but marked it down because it does not have an age/size limit and it is definitely breakable by toddlers."
2,Not made for all cabinets!,"These do not work on my cabinets. I gave it a two star rating because they seem very difficult to put in, don't tell you they may not work with your cabinet, and have a SHORT return date. I got 2 days?? at most. If you're cabinets are the kind that have the regular flat top then these are fine. However, if yours are like mine and have about a 1 inch top and then go farther up then these will not work. The top of your cabinet has to be completely even and flat. Please note that before you buy these because no one told me and no review said it."
5,best cabnet lock,I think that this cabinet lock is one of the best because it does not pinch little fingers that open the doors or drawers.
4,SMALL,"These are what am looking for but they are just small so they dont work that good for me, i have big drawer i need something little big."
4,Works well and prevents finger slams.,"We have installed these and the same item with the removable mount for the hook. They work very well and prevent the kids from closing the cabinet doors and drawers on their fingers. We especially love the convenience of the version with the removable hook for when we aren't letting the kids run free. However, one of our twin one-year-olds figured out within a few days how to slide the hook up and out of the mount for the removable hook version, so on the lowest drawers we have had to install the non-removable version. Of the hook-type safety latches we have tried, these are by far the best. [We have not tried the magnetic key type latches, and with this product we likely will not need to.]"
1,Shoddy product,"This is a terribly designed product. I am going to throw them out because:1. the screws are so bad that two of the first three broke as I tried to use them, even though I was screwing into wood using a hand screwdriver. They seem to be made of the softest metal imaginable.2. It is quite difficult to install the other piece in exactly the right location so that they fit together well.3. Even once I installed it with my own screws, the drawer could not close all the way.I will use rubber bands instead and look for something better designed."
4,100 years of South Florida history,"Well written and engaging, appears well researched. Not a 'boring' history book, instead history told with a story line. Describes life in Southeast Florida and the Keys from mid 1800s thru 1930s."
2,unfortunately disappointing,"I have to agree with one of the other reviewers, there were definitely not enough beads in the kit. I also only attempted the big 'lotus bud' necklace and I ran out of beads early enough that I started substituting red for blue and green. I really think that if a company is going to sell a bead book/kit combo, they need to put EXTRA beads, and enough to make ALL the projects.The book (more like a booklet) that goes with it is decent enough, but it was a bit suprising to end up with a black and white book for making a colored bead project. It would have been easier to follow if it had been in color.The concept and the booklet are good, but the bead issue makes it lose major stars in my opinion."
2,Actual product is shield not the sword,The product is fine if you are looking for a display shield. The product title and description are incorrect as you are not buying item UC1416 United Cutlery Argonaut Sword but rather item 1416 Classic Medieval Round Shield. The pictures for the item are correct and if a shield is what you are looking for the price is very decent.
5,It's a surprise that it is an English version,"When this DVD was announced to launch on Jan 23, 2003 I was hesitated to make a preorder because I got the video already. But I am glad I did because this is an English version whereas the video is in German. I appreciate that no other artists could be so considerate as Andre who always records more than two languages versions for his fans all over the world, it requires extra effort especially in a live concert. This was a concert in Vienna in1999 in memory of 100 years of Johann Strauss death. Let's see how magnificant the concert hall has been decorated, how beautiful are the music and remarkable the performance of Andre & the JSO. As a bonus special, we also know some update facts & data about Andre which every fan would be interested."
5,Andre Rieu's wonderful music!,"I couldn't be happier with a DVD than I am with Andre Rieu's 100 Years of Strauss. Actually, I have bought several of Andre's DVD's from Amazon and am thrilled with all of them. Watching Andre and his orchestra, and listening to their invigorating music, vastly improves any evening! I highly recommend 100 Years of Strauss!"
5,Another Hit,Couldn't ask for better if you enjoy Andre Rieu - I would recommend to anyone that just simply enjoys music
2,Not worth it!!!!,I bought this because I thought it was gonna be the band talking throughout the entire thing. This is horrible!!! It has some lady reading throughout it and not even 1 minute of the band speaking on each track. Save yourself some money and watch Bon Jovi:Behind The Music.
2,Terra Toscana appetizer plates,"These plates are really pretty and just what I was looking for. However, they are starting to chip and I will be returning them. Really disappointed in the quality."
1,Not really The Runaways...,"Beware. This isn't really The Runaways. This was a cheap cash-in on the Runaways name with no involvement by Joan, Lita, Cherie, etc.Buy it at your own risk!"
3,Very complex,"I found this to be extremely complex and difficult to really get much benefit out of - so far. I am sure when I learn the steps more, it will be a good workout. Halfway through the workout and I'm not even cracking a sweat because I keep stumbling. This is only my second time trying it and I am no better the second time than the first. I will give this a few tries before this gets consigned to the give away pile. I've been doing videos for years.. I have about 35 of them and this is the first one I've ever felt this frustrated with"
3,Cute Movie,"This is not a bad movie at all. It's a sugar coated little family movie that is suitable for all ages.I do wish that a serious bigfoot movie would come out some day but in the mean time this little venture into the Sasquatch mythos is enough to keep the youngsters interested for 90 minutes.Not quite as good as ""Harry and the Hendersons"" but it is a good effort and it entertains.For the Bigfoot genre completist this is one to score, although this is no ""Legend of Boggy Creek"" or ""Creature from Black Lake"" it is a noteable notch in ""Cinema Du Sasquatch"" and worthy of a space on the shelf, perhaps next to ""Snowbeast"".For the average consumer, it's probably better to rent it."
3,Biker movies,The movie kept my interest but I really needed to put myself back a few years to keep me interested. All in all it was a pretty good show.
4,Smells Good,I have a Sebo but this is just a quarter size disk that you drop in the vacuum bags. So far so good. It has a light sweet scent. I havn't had long enough to know its longevity.
4,Does the job,"I like these tablets because you can crush them and put directly in the bag, rather than clogging up your vac motor and breathing the dust from the carpet powder.Shipping was timely. I would recommend."
3,they work but can't stand the smell!,"The whole point of getting these was to take care of the dusty smell from the vacuum. They definitely take care of that, but I can't stand the smell of these things! The closest thing I can think of is trying to mix pungent algae with Clorox bleach and throw in a little sulfur for fun!"
3,Withdrawal,"South Carolina withdraws from the Union. There is great celebration through out Charleston. The Citadel cadets were very much a part of the festivities. Allard and Robert two of the cadets leave the Citadel to join different Confederate armies. They each learn that the war is not the glorious affair at Ft. Sumter. This is a fast moving story of these two cadets and their friends in the Civil War. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"
4,Good primer on anti-diet thought,"An interesting book-length essay on the politics of food science and culture in the United States. Stacy looks at the weird ways Americans are altering their diets in order to measure up to some imagined nutritional ideal. She interviews several scientists, chefs and food writers who claim that the result is a pathological and cultural fear of food that brings about the very problems that these altered diets were meant to avoid. Along the way, the book pauses to talk with the inventor of Olestra, the fat substitute that failed abysmally in the marketplace, and with the head of the nation's leading vegetarian advocacy group. This is a good companion volume to the last few chapters of Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking, and a necessary waystation for anyone contemplating a radical change in diet."
1,Repetitive... repetitive...,Forget about this book. It goes on and on and on... Did I mention it's a little repetitive too?
1,Disco inmaduro e inacabado,"Está muy lejos de los mejores discos del Flaco. Es un producto de transición, bastante flojo y con pésima post-producción. Sólo para coleccionistas e incondicionales de Spinetta."
1,sucks.,this phone sux. bad. it only lasted about 9 weeks. it is the reason i got an iphone. i needed two more words to post this review.
4,Surprise Success!,"I didn't know what to expect when I read this book -- but I loved it. M. La Court challenges our notions of what kids are capable of, both in good and bad ways. I cared about these kids -- and the adult. For a breakout novel, it's an impressive one!"
2,Dispensational Dogmatics,"First, I must say that I am a professed dispensationalist and agree with most of the author's conclusions. But I must confess the impression that this was more a work of brainwashing and browbeating than a serious scholarly work. It does have some redeeming qualities, but with its inane rants and often poorly-argued assertions, the book does injustice to the quality exegetical work done by dispensationalists over the years. It gives good insight into the author's thoughts on dispensationalism, but should by no means be used as a general survey of evangelical hermeneutics."
2,There are better hermeneutics texts out there,"Though I am a dispensationalist and agree with most of Couch's presuppositions, I find that this volume is perhaps the most biased book I have read in my 4 (and counting) years of seminary. With constant barrages of emotionally laden assertions he shoots his arrows at straw men and gives zero credibility to the other side. If you have the choice of reading one general hermeneutics text, do not read this one. If you are required to read this book for a class... well... just try not to get too mad at it."
4,Solid,"It's what it says it is, an intro to hermeneutics. He doesn't hide the fact he's a classic dispensationalist. I'm in the same camp, so I found the book valuable. It's not a presentation of different approaches. He lays out what he believes and why and doesn't candy coat it."
2,Dispensational Propaganda,"I was quite mislead by the title of the book. While it would appear that Couch intends to survey hermeneutical methods, he instead creates a defense of conservative dispensational hermeneutics. But he doesn't stop there, Couch goes as far as to imply that an allegorical hermeneutic not only is wrong, but also a large contributor to the decline of the Church as a whole. Couch's book is very well written, but ignores the valuable treasures which can be found outside of conservative dispensational hermeneutics. I would recomend this book for anyone seeking to better understand dispensationalists and what they believe as well as anyone looking for a defense for pre-trib and pre-mil views, but to anyone looking for an unbiased perspective I suggest that you continue searching"
5,The Today Show,"Wow! What a great read! After buying this for myself, I also purchased it for my mom and father-in-law. There is so much history in this book... and full of pictures, it makes the reading so interesting!Any Today Show fan (like me) should check this out! It's so great! :)"
3,Performances are good but the mono sound really detracts from performance,"Beware of the mono sound which is too much for me to really enjoy these performances unfortunately. I am not someone who needs the latest digital, noise-free performance either however.For a great Brahms 1 - get the Karajan ""DG original"" coupled with Schumann's 1st symphony. It is truly a wonderful performance and the bass in the opening first movement is powerful. Ignore David Hurwitz's comments on this symphony. Walter on Sony is also superb for 1st through 3th symphonies.As many have already said, Kleiber for Brahms 4 is the standard although some like Karl Sanderling's 4th too."
3,More of a Travelogue,"I found this book a pleasant read, and it was interesting to read the French perspective on this subject matter, but it is essentially a travel diary. In other words, there is no in-depth analysis of historical mysteries here. It is what it is.."
2,Fascinating-but really?,"No bibliography. No footnotes, except his own previous works. Very disappointing from a scholarly perspective. Basis his assumptions on the etymology of place names, etc. Heavy on myths and legends, slides over the scarce few facts we do know about what so-called heretics believed in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. This book muddies the past rather than bringing the Cathers into the light. If a reader wants to search out the myths this is a fascinating read. If a reader prefers accurate knowlege about heretics in medieval southern France, I suggest reading source documents, such as those found in Heresis of the High Middle Ages, by Wakefield and Evans, start with Peter de Bruis and Peter Waldo. Strayer and O'Shea are closer to reality."
3,"Another pulp history, not as good as Holy Blood, Holy Grail","The book says ostensibly very little about Montsegur or the mystery related to the fall of the castle during the Albigensian crusades. It has a nice section of reviewing some of cites, such as major castles where Cathars, hid from their persecutors; it has a section dedicated to some of the heresies; it expounds on the role of heresies for the society of the middle ages.I found the book lacking in each of these areas. For those interested in the chronology of events, try ""The Albigensian Crusades"" by Stryer. Those interested in mysteries should try ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail""; those interested in Cathars, should try ""The Cathars in Lanquedoc""."
2,Montsegur and the Mystery of the Cathars,"Very detailed but the author assumes you have read his books on the Celtic beliefs, jumps around between subjects quite often in an attempt to prove a vague concept, and overall made the subject quite a difficult read.On the other hand, the author is very accurate and detailed allowing for a mostly unbiased history."
3,Flawed research,"Markale's research reveals some glaring flaws and ignorance. On page 127, referring to the messianic tradition, he writes: ""There is nothing of this in the Hebrew tradition."" When in fact, the Old Testament contains many passages relating to what will come to pass when the Messiah arrives."
5,"This is an amazing bargain with many wonderful, hard-to-find tunes.","For the money this is an amazing find. Although there are some tracks with poor sound, considering that these were salvaged from very old vinyl, the sound here is mostly excellent. Lovers of vintage country music will be thrilled with this collection. THIS REVIEW REFERS TO THE 10 CD box set ON THE MEMBRAN LABEL only."
1,do not buy,"This looks like an airtex pump even has ""airtex"" on the plastic body. but that is all the pump arrived in a plain box (not the factory box) with ""foam"" packing. The pump lasted 3 days and had to buy full price after that (thats how I know the diffrent package) there was no ""O"" ring or plug in the box (the factory box contaned all the parts) do not get this pump unknowen where this pump came from. did not contact sell on this one not worth time or hassle. Cheap part and lesson learned"
4,Great Information but Too Dense for Audio?,"I read the audiobook version of this work and I loved this topic and the information provided was superior. I found the content to be well-researched and the flow of the information was very smooth. The historical content explained a lot of things about how different cultures affected others and interacted with others through exploration and conquests.I did, however, feel that because this book is packed with details and facts, I had to rewind sections to relisten to them if I became distracted by something or if a stray thought popped into my mind. As much as I enjoyed this, I think it would have been better to have read the print version instead of the audiobook.Regardless of the media you choose, this book is highly insightful and worth reading if you're interested in world history, cultural interactions or world conquests. I'm recommending it to my friends!"
5,great historical referance,"Thomas has written several great books on ethnic groups and histroy like ethnic america and race and culture. Conquest and culture fallows this trend. It looks at several different cultures and looked at how they changed through time. The cultures he looks at are the English, Native Americans, Africans, and Slavs. All of these groups have important histories that need to be told. Conquest is definetely something you should read if you're interested in learning about how cultures change through time and are affected by different cultures."
1,Didn't prepare for the 2007 test at all,"My wife just took the Praxis test this book was supposed to prepare her for. It suggests that legislation and court case decisions are an important subject that will be covered and the practice test does cover it. But guess what? She took the test and there was NOTHING like this on the test. She was shocked. Instead it heavily covered dissabilities and what would be the best course of action in the illustrated situations.It also didn't focus only on common dissabilities. Also mentioned were the less common ones like Mutism and Prader-Willi Syndrome. There may have been different versions of the test, so maybe she just was unlucky. Common sense seemed to be the most valuable skill tested."
3,Good Overview but Skinny,I didn't expect this book to be so skinny. It does give a good overview of what to study for. It's pretty much just lists topics. If you need freshening on topics then you need to pull out the text books.
4,Core Knowledge Study Guide:Special Education,I have purchased similar study guides previously and they have turned out to be useful. The format of this book is very easy to follow and understandable. I am scheduled to take a test in September but I'm sure that we this study guide material I won't have any troubles passing the exam.
1,Does not fit 2001 Xterra,This particular model and brand of oil cap does not fit (thread diameter too large) the 2001 Nissan Xterra 4WD V6 3.3L version. I purchased it through a local parts store and it didn't fit. I'll try another brand.
4,Enjoyable,I got this book because I was interested in improved education & was very pleased to find an interesting story that carried the message.
5,Oodles of noodles!,Great finish to a set- big heavy shallow bowls are ideal for pastas and stews. The embossed circle on the plates and bowls makes them unusual. Buy the whole set! they look great on a table. I'm delighted with them! Very trendy and cool.
4,my boys love this for some reason,"This is the first review I have ever done on Amazon. I picked this up at a coop sale for like $[...] and it is obviously the best $$ we ever spent. I personally feel like it is just average but my boys go CRAZY over these three videos. The 4 year old likes ""Firefighter Mike"" and the 2 year old twins like ""Garbage Truck"" (the third one) the best. They have to watch it every day unless I can divert their attention away from it.I don't know if the price justifies the quality which is why I did 4 stars but seriously - my kids are crazy about these three videos. That is why I am on here: to research buying collection #1."
5,"Great Product, I Bought this for my Office Desk and Love it!","I looked at a lot of leather desk mats before finally deciding to buy this one and I am very happy I did so.It looks and feels great,It stays in place and allows me to protect my desk from scratching. I use my mouse on this surface and it works great and feels great on my wrist when typing as well."
3,"Useful guide to some basics, but ... notation","This covers quickly using just vector analysis the basic ideas of classical DG: curves and surfaces with the fundamental forms. But the notation is a real problem. It uses the wedge not for wedge products but for cross products. So the notation really clashes with EVERYTHING modern, and even most books from 40 years ago. If brevity is important this book does a reasonable job, otherwise look elsewhere.Suitable for 2nd year math, physics or engineering."
5,Rock solid!,"I got this for my son for Christmas and I have to say this is a quality product. Putting it together wasn't complicated and after it was setup, it felt very solid with the toms and cymbals mounted to it. Now he needs more cymbal mounts. Great product"
1,Not what I ordered,The DVD I got was not the same as the one pictured. They sent out a new one and it still wasn't the right one.
1,WHat are the; movies on the collection?,"I would like to purchase this item but I bought some other cabbage patch movies,and I do not want to duplicate them. What are the movies on the collection? Does anyone know?"
3,Concerned,"I have long had the desire to play the saxophone. However it was not until recently that i was able to obtain one through this online offer. Have played piano for the past 14 yrs (i am 21) I know my way around music and thus opted to teach myself the sax. However, the excitement i had when i just got the instrument soon turned to despair. Within a week of use, the thumb rest for the left thumb has begun cracking. Another major concern was the pitch of the sound produced by the instrument. I wonder if this were a E flat alto sax or a D sax because the the sound generated is a half tone lower than it ought to be!! (C on the sax sounds like D on the piano and not a E flat.) Indeed i am concerned and upset about. People beware.!!"
3,A bit informal,"I have purchased several of the German Language series in the past and this was was ""pretty good,"" but not the best. I liked listening and repreating to the native speaker, but the ""host"" of the show (who had an unusual perspective compared to traditional language tapes) did not make me feel that I was learning enough to function well in the country (I travel to Germany once per year).I prefer the Q&A; strategies of learning languages rather than the Listen & Repeat (which is helpful for pronunciation, don't get me wrong).Anyway, this is a pretty good series and one that is still good for listenting to in the car for review for your next trip to Deutschland."
5,Great Book,I like to buy my adult sons still Childrens Books for Christmas and I saw this and they like hardback books and it was such a cheap price so i got it and it is wonderful and nice pictures.
1,Not the Deluxe Learning Edition,"I ordered the Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Deluxe Learning Edition, at what I thought was a good deal on a used set of books. That isn't what I received. I received the Programmer's Guide only. Why didn't I return it? I needed it for work. I'm a C# developer who was hired for a code maintenance position. The majority of issues are in the company's legacy code. So I needed a reference book. The order arrived on time and I was charged what was stated, but it was NOT the correct product."
3,fair,Be careful to buy this item.this items have 3 set.but many seller sold only one book.you must check this item.i've refunded all my money.
3,Good basic instructions,"Good basic instructions, but leaves a lot to be desired. Appears to be the basis of other books on Visual Basic 6."
3,Hard on knees but wonderful.,"I purchased this video thanks in part to the reviewer comments on Amazon. My only regret is that in all my reading there was no mention of how hard this video is on someone with bad knees. I recently tore the ligaments in my knee and while it is healed, the number of squats, lunges, and dead lifts in this video are painful. That said, this video is well done and I find myself looking forward to the challenge of doing the workout. I highly recommend Jari Love and her methods, I just wish there was a variety of exercise for the legs."
2,BORING!,I'm sure this would work if you could do it long enough without being bored out of your mind! All of the moves are very basic and you do a lot of them. The set is boring and the instructor is boring. I purchased this because everyone on the exchange wanted it. I did it once and put it up for trade right after I finished. Mina Lessig's One Minute Workout is far superior because you can up the weight and the DVD always randomly chooses your workout for you so you don't get bored.
3,okay,i like ripped to the core better. When looking at JL working out-her ribs stick out along her sides-that is not muscle its her ribs and photos supposedly make you look heavier than you are. Anyone can look ripped if they weigh 10 pounds. So don't go by her physique-the workout is okay.
2,Disturbing,"I started to watch this video so I could be familiar with it before I try the workout. I was shocked to see how unhealthy-looking and skinny Jari Love is. And I am not a out-of-shape person who is put off by very fit/thin people; I'm normally a size 0 or 2. About 10 minutes into the viewing, I had to shut it off and have never tried the exercises because she doesn't appear fit, she appears almost anorexic which, as the title of my review says, I find disturbing. I'll stick with Cathe Freidrich; try her Muscle Max for a really good total body workout."
1,"boring, cheesy not well put together",I like the get ripped 1000 but it hurt my knees so i bought slim and lean. Yuck cheesy set not as well put together as get ripped 1000. Too much emphasis on the arms and not enough on lower body. Don't waste time or money on this better spent on get ripped 1000. I returned this one the same day i bought it
1,what is going on?,"This is by far the worst video I've ever purchased. Jari Love walks you through a 5 minute workout and that is the only time she is in this video. After the warm up, it turns into an instrustional video where some random man will do a basic move (like a push up) and a voice will explain the move. They dont even do reps that you may perfrom to, they simply explain the move and begin a new move.This may be the style that some people want (I could see men enjoying this style), but I prefer to workout along with the instructer. I did not like this video."
4,"Fun, but not for dabblers","This dvd is serious about toning each muscle group. There are lots of repetitions, and pulsing- which are very effective and tiring. The work out is long, closer to an hour than 30min., so you need some time to do it. The woman who leads the workout is a little cheesy and annoying, but the workout is so good that I found it easy to overlook."
5,Jari Love is Great!!!,"Jari is fantastic. I am a huge fan of her style of working and her videos make me feel like I am taking my fitness to the next level. She has great form and her videos are clean and well-organized. She is not sloppy at all which I very much appreciate. I always feel great after doing her workouts and try to rotate through each of them through the week. Her workouts are advanced, but if you have not spent a lot of time with toning and weights you could also work your way into the workouts."
2,Boring!,"Not the right workout video for me. Although the exercises are effective, the flow seems to go too slow. I lost interest quickly."
4,Great video,"This was my first venture into the Jari Love workouts. I'm hooked. I bought the set of three (Slim & Lean, Ripped, and Ripped to the Core) and tried the Slim and Lean first. All the moves are really simple. No fancy, hard to follow footwork or expensive equipment is required. (I don't consider the handweights expensive.) And to me, that's important because if I can't keep up with the move or they're confusing the video will do nothing but collect dust.The only thing I didn't like about the video was the breaks of instuction between each track. There is a man's voice and another man demonstrating the move. This is helpful for the first and second time using it, but once you got the moves down (again, they're really not complex) you don't need the instuction.Jari is very positive and encourages you to keep going. I like that there are always someone else doing a modification.Great video!"
4,Good workout,Slim and Lean is a good straight forward weight training program. No cardio in it though so you need to supplement with a cardio program. it is a full hour. Not suitable for beginners however you could start some of the routine with no weights and work your way up. Definite value add to any exercise library.
5,Excellent workout!,"I just tried this dvd and loved working out to it. It is a great workout whether you are a beginner or advanced exerciser. The body part workouts are broken out into sections so you can work on your biceps, abs, or whatever parts you wish to work on. You can either choose sections or workout to the whole dvd. I'm going to get more of Jari Love's exercise dvds...from the reviews they are just as good!"
2,Very disappointed!,I have been doing the Jillian Michael's workouts for about 9 months and wanted something equally as challenging but different. By the reviews I thought I was going to get a good workout. I didn't even break a sweat! There is a lot of wasted time in between segments where I'd rather be working out then just stretching or watching the correct method for an exercise. I feel she wastes time by having you sit to do arm excercises when you could be doing squats and arm exercises at the same time. I recommend any of Jillian Michael's DVDs any day over this!
2,This Set Is Missing a Movie,"I bought this set because I wanted to own ""Coma"" and ""Disclosure."" ""Coma"" is not included in this set. The movie ""Disclosure"" plays and both sides of one disc and the quality is pretty bad. ""A Perfect Murder"" and ""Falling Down"" have better quality but I personally did'nt like the ""Falling Down"" movie. I recommend buying the movies you want separately."
3,Family Guy Volume 6,My Family Guy did not arrive for 3 weeks after my pay pal went through. The first Disk scrachs on it.
4,B+ Suggest to all,"Paid for gift wrap, but it did not arrive wrapped. I don't know if that's amazon's fault or the seller's, but overall a great product, a great transaction, and timely delivery. Thank you! I would still suggest to friends and family."
3,Family Guy Volume 6,"This product arrived in a timely manner and very well packed. The shows play fine, however in a few of the episodes there is digital noise. Looks like someone was inserting words into a gray staticy box during some of the shows. Makes me wonder if the movies are legitimate, despite their packaging."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I have loved this show since the day it began but seriously, this makes the recent simpsons episodes look amazing. I purchased this and after watching past episodes I decided to sell it before anyone else realizes this volume is lazy, Repetitive and unoriginal. Seth and the gang need to stop spending time selling atheism and their hatred for George Bush, honestly making fun of the president is like shooting fish in a barrel. I hope the writers' strike helped lose some of the dead weight on the writing team of this once awesome show. Sadly from what I've seen at the beginning of this season, I think it's time for Family Guy to take a bow."
1,Should have ended at season three,"Several years ago, I was one of the many fans who thought bringing back Family Guy was a great idea. I loved the three seasons that were out and considered it better than South Park. Now I loathe that idea. Seth Green not only killed his show, but made it painful to watch. I kept trying to give him the benefit of the doubt, but every new episode seems forced and then there is absolutely almost no plot line anymore. Every episode just seems to say the same thing; Seth hates Bush, Republicans, Christians, and is anti-military. Doing a show about those things may work once or twice...but every episode? I can't even watch the older series anymore, it's just so old and pathetic. But obviously there are many simpleminded fools out there, so he'll keep making the show, laughing all the way to the bank."
1,Down the tubes,"I'm not the first to say it. Family Guy was an amzing show and now is some of the biggest crap on television. Is anyone still watching? They took one of my favorite characters of all time, Stewie, and turned him into his exact opposite. No longer the evil, scheming, lil anti christ, all his jokes now involve him in women's clothes or in some homosexual situation. Why are you people buying these half seasons of pure garbage? I stopped at volume 3 or as i see it ""the death of Stewie."" The rest is a mess of repeated jokes and old humor, cut in half and sold for the same price. Even if you like the show still, at least try and get your moneys worth."
1,These DVDs should be title Money Guy,"Family Guy started its life as a great show. Unlike anything before it. What happend is they pushed the bar; now drenched with fame the creators don't seem to care anymore. The first vol contained two seasons and really jumped started the DVD TV show craze that is now so popular. Its funny that the main reason the first and second vol DVD was so great is the very reason the recent ones arn't. These half seasons! I hope they take care of this.Also, the show it self is suffering. Stewie is now a homosexual; far from the violent devil he use to be. The show is not pushing any envolpe anymore. The jokes are old. They keep reapeating everything. I think Family Guy is going the way of the Simpsons. ""As a used to be funny show."""
5,freakin` sweet!,family guy vol. 6 everything it was put up to be! im glad i have this one to add to my collection!
4,I hate Fox.,"I love Family Guy, I have been watching for years. Vol. 6 was funny, yet a bit of a let down. It should be one season per volume. I like some of the special features, but almost a whole DVD dedicated to them, far to much. It is also a bit annoying that Blue Harvest is no included. Fox just wants to squeeze us for all the money they can. I would recommend this Vol. to any fan, if only to complete the fifth season, and for the 100th and 101st episodes.With the way the show is going, I doubt I will buy Vol. 7."
1,What has happened to Family Guy?,"family guy has become such garbage. i cant believe people still find it funny, its downright sad to watch what this once amazing show has become. they're really scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas now, and im so tired of all the lame jokes they use to just take up time(chicken fight, conway twitty) seriously, you have roughly 18 minutes per show and that trash takes up atleast 3 minutes of it. ridiculous, ill stick to south park."
2,I'm ashamed of myself,"I haven't watched Family Guy on TV in quite a while. I just don't have time on sunday nights. After watching these episodes on dvd, I'm simply ashamed of myself for continuing to support this show. I used to enjoy this show simply for cheap laughs. But sadly, cheap laughs have been overshadowed by Seth Mcfarlane's agenda.South Park is a message show. The Simpsons is often a message show. But Family Guy has always been fast moving, dirty, and funny. Now it's fast moving, dirtier, occasionally funny, and preachy.I get it Seth. You're an athiest. You're a Democrat. You hate the government. Now let's get back to making people laugh. Or at least make an intelligent, substantial argument, rather than simply spitting in the general direction of those you disagree with, or making jokes about Laura Bush getting scraped.To the fans: IF YOU WANT THIS SHOW TO GET BETTER, JUST DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!! It's that simple. Don't buy vol. 7 either. I know I won't."
2,Great show,"Great show, yes, but charging so much for only 12 episodes reeks. The list price should only be half as much as a regular season of a show."
2,You dont get the good cover.,The only reason I bought this from Amazon is because the pictures suggested that I'd get the original cover. while the episodes are fine (so far) its a major disappointment that this volume is of inferior production quality to the other volumes.
5,Family Guy Does It Again,"There's a reason why Seth MacFarlane is one of the highest paid writers in Hollywood today. Family Guy continues to be a fun and brilliant show. This volume even includes the 100th episode, which is hilarious. Those who are fans of Family Guy and continue to be fans of Family Guy will love this new edition to the Family Guy dvds. The only disappointment is that Blue Harvest wasn't included on the DVD since it was the seasons first episode. Otherwise it delivers all the humor you would expect from Family Guy."
2,Quit Preaching!,"I have all the Family Guy DVD sets and have always enjoyed them. The sixth season is B.S.!! Very preachy! Yes, we know you like pot, don't like ex-president Bush and don't believe in god but I don't want your morals pushed on me all season. JUST SHUT UP AND BE FUNNY! I still watch the other seasons just not 6."
3,Mixed bag,"Ever since creator Seth Mcfarlane started American Dad, Family Guy has been a mixed bag. Some epsiodes are funny and others are dreadful. This set contains alot of shows that are dreadful and not alot i'd consider good. They actually made bonus features worth watching, the other season bonus features were scarce and not worth watching.Why does Family Guy add a curse word to each show? I swear and dont mind if people swear, but I think they do it so people can buy the dvd sets or seem cool to a younger crowd. I've only can recall a few times where swearing was a funny. Other parts seemed to do it to fill the quota of one swear per show. The jokes have even been more over the top and tasteless. I think some are funny but alot people find are uncalled for. I find alot of people hate the tasteless jokes and thats the reason why they stopped watching the show. I think Seth and his staff need to sit down and watch seasons 1-3 and remember why people loved this show."
2,Not like it used to be.,I have bought all the Family Guy DVD's and have thoroughly enjoyed all of them until this season. This season so far has been poor comparitively and I wouldn't recommend it.
5,Family Guy fan,great DVD will enjoy this series Seth MacFarlane is sooooo funny! I enjoy this show very much! Would recommended to everyone!
5,family guy fan,This is one fof the best box sets that ive seen yet and i got it very fast through amazon!!!
5,Great Dvd Collection!,Great collection of the funniest show on tv! I recommend this dvd for any Family Guy fan!
2,American Destruction,"Ok, I used to LOVE watching Family Guy. The older episodes are the best. Back when the show was only humor and not rediculous political agendas. I understand Seth McFarlane hates America, but he should not allow his unamerican ideals to be put upon ignorant TV watchers who do not know any better. An episode recently made a comment about Laura Bush killing a man. Whether you are conservative, liberal, republican, or democrat, whether you love or hate George Bush, almost EVERYONE loves Laura Bush and to attack her is absolutely disgusting and this show should be ashamed of themselves. I cannot believe one of my favorite shows has turned into something with as many lies and horrible American destruction as a film by Michael Moore."
3,"Only 12 episodes, still mostly funny","Don't buy this unless you can get it for less than $25. Thanks to the writer's strike, you will only find twelve episodes here. When it was first released, it was almost as expensive as those with twice as many episodes. I'm starting to get a little tired of the show as of this season, as it's moving from fresh sick-and-wrong humor to boring sick-and-wrong humor. They're pushing it to see how far they can go with offending people, but it's just starting to get repetitive.Of course, as a woman, I'm apparently not their target audience. :)"
1,Just not funny anymore,"Family Guy has lost a lot of its humor in this...volume? Season? Quit preaching politics and just make me laugh. The 13 episodes on a volume sucks too. Sorry to those who don't mind, but it is a rip off, whether it's Fox or the creators. I loved this show. I have all the previous volumes/seasons, but now I just see a political agenda. Sorry again, I watched this show to be entertained not forced to listen to someone else's political ideology and it has become worse. These episodes just aren't humorous or memorable to me. I once thought myself to be a diehard fan, but sadly I can't call myself that anymore. I don't find myself laughing nearly as much and that is sad indeed. I await the day Family Guy returns and Political Dude goes off the air. Sorry fans of Family Guy, it's not what it used to be. I understand the negative feedback I'll receive, it's just the show doesn't entertain ME anymore."
2,Disappointed,"Although the actual product is good, the cover you say it's in in the picture is rather a lie. I have bought the previous Family Guy volumes from Amazon and they gave me the good covers. I'm not necissarily happy with it."
1,Preachy,"I would have to agree with some of these reviews, where as Family Guy use to be an entertaining show where you can watch it and just laugh. Not to have someone elses political reviews constantly in your face. I recieved this item as a gift. I have every season, however, the show has gotten preachy and uncomfortable to watch. What happened to good ol fashion stupid humor. I think all day. All i need is 30min of pure comedy and feel good entertainment. Now its like watching Brian's democratic hour.there are too many scenes with him. I enjoy the occasional stupid Peter moments. However, i tend to change the channel if its an episode with Brian in it. It was always kind of offensive. Which made it dunny cuz they made fun of everybody. Too bad. Ill miss this show when its cancelled. If only it could emulate its old seasons. Which i find my self watching over and over again."
1,NOT FUNNY...Lost The Magic!,The show has lost the magic...and lost the fun. The episodes are no longer funny!! Save your money...not worth buying at all.
1,- I'd rather choose MEMOREX...,"Ok.... First of all im gonna keep this review short and un technical...just like they did the manufacturing! lol I would rather listen to an atrack player throuh walkman headphones than walk down a Isle that supports or has anything to do with ""COBY"" Listen... I would rather watch a japanese movie in black n white, with no subtitle on a 5"" screen thanto support coby in any way shape or form! to be completely honest, I really dont see how they still exist, I mean... they've gotta be making about $45,000 a year...B4 TAXES!.. coby stands for ""CUSTOMERS OBVIOUSLY BROKE YEARLY!!"
2,Only useful for DVD playback,"This DVD system does not have an aux input, so the speakers can not be used for anything else, unless you have a receiver to directly connect to the 5 speakers. So, I boudght a receiver, but I am not sure the subwoofer works right by itself (in the DVD setup, the subwoofer would receive and redirect all the channels from the DVD). As an entry-level model, it is thus not very useful: who wants to buy a separate receiver, which would cost as much as the whole entry-level system? Just look for a DVD home theater system with aux input if you like to use speakers."
1,Absolute rubish,"This is the worst peice of electronics I have ever purchased. It is absolutely dreadful in every which way. It was defective straight out of the box. And many other people report the same issues of receiver freezing, speakers not working, remote interference etc... Mine was no exception. You would think they do quality control on these, well for 70$ I guess not."
1,Buyer Beware.,I bought this unit for my son as a gift. The DVD player completly quit working. Amazon.com and the manufacturer Coby USA will not replace it because the warranty is expired. That is money down the toilet. At least if I bought something like this from Walmart that they would honor their products.Good luck to you.
3,Does What It's Supposed to Do,"You have to be practically sitting on top of it for the remote control to work. Also, it's a bit clunky and I'm always having to consult the instructions because I can't remember what button to push when. However the recording is not bad and DVD's made on it can play on other DVD players so I don't regret buying it. I will, however, look at other companies when I decide to upgrade."
3,"So / So not a very reliable machine, but not very expensive either... ???","I got this unit last december from overstock.cm - as a refurbished clearance item - for under 90 bucks.It worked great for about a month , but then, and now , once it is 'warmed up' after a couple of hours use, it somehow digitizes my s-video input / output , making a very 'jerky' picture. Powering unit off and on again fixes the problem temporarily. Recordings on the timer are iffy and - i think results are almost always quite dependent on the blank media you use, I got very cheap dvd-r's and dvd-rw's from neweggg.cm and both work efficiently.You get what you pay for in this case."
5,Chopin Piano Concerto 1 Marta Argarich,"What a fantastic recording. Marta is such a fine pianist. This recording will drift you to another place, especially the second movement. Bliss!!"
4,Praise for sex in america,"This book is the culmination of an enormous undertaking. 9,000 addresses were selected from random geographical locations. The participants, aged 18 to 55 years, completed an hour and a half interview about their sexual practices. Anyone interested in human sexuality will want to learn about the results from this study. Although this book does not go into the depth or detail of ""The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the Unites States,"" this book is more user-friendly. This book is a must for therapists who deal not only with sexulaity issuess but also relationship issues. Previous research has demonstrated that all couples have arguments about work, money and sex. Thus, it is essential to learn what the actual sexual practices of couples are and this book is a tool with a wealth of information."
5,Best available data,"A lot of groups with particular agendas attack this study because it doesn't confirm the biases of the past. But just because you don't like it, that doesn't mean it isn't true.And that's really the heart of this study, trying to get to the truth.Or at least a better version of the truth than what we've had in the past.I highly recommend this if only to see just how difficult it is to conduct a ""good"" statistically valid survey of this type. The resulting data are somewhat incidental, and not likely to be grossly affected by the minor irregularities in the methodology. And for those with actual statistical methodological training, the authors provide their data for review."
2,Flawed,"When this book was first published, it was largely panned for its research methodology. The responses and conclusions are suspect because the interviewers were deemed too aggressive in collecting the data.This book is interesting only as a object lesson in what happens when a person is asked personal questions they don't want to answer."
1,OUTDATED INFORMATION,"This study was done 15 years ago! A lot has changed.Also, while the authors are quick to dismiss other surveys and studies they neglect to tell us what is wrong with them scientifically and statistically. Yet they fail to mention their own test parameters except in very vague terms giving us only total number of test subjects interviewed, less then 2,000! This seems like way too small a sample size to project what 300,000,000 Americans are doing and thinking about sex!"
3,"Historian Dumas, not Novelist Dumas","This novel is much more obscure and difficult to find than are the more celebrated Dumas novels such as The Count of Monte Cristo and the Musketeer novels. While it is certainly the work of Dumas, with his inimitable style and engrossing characters, it is much more a history than a Romantic novel. He frequently spends chapters upon chapters describing which army did what to whom and for how long, not that it mattered because God was protecting France. It is not a bad read, but it is a bit dry if you are not as interested in serious history as in the tales the author habitually spins."
5,Very pleased with this system,"I got that system last week. It is one of the best ratio of specs to money in this category of centrino laptops.I am very pleased with its performance. This compaq offers really some goodies which are top notch. 60G HDD, CDR, 1.3 Centrino and remember the 1200 VGA (32Megs-ATI) which is really very impressive on that sharp 15"" Screen. I do recommend this PC especially for university student, since wifi connectivity is available on campuses. You will be impressed also by the built in card readers (SD)."
2,I ordered this but....,"I received a watch case with a glass cover, rather than solid cover as advertised. As I did not receive the correct product, I was naturally disappointed. The finishing is also not very even, with some parts not properly lacquered. Overall, it didn't meet my expectations."
1,Cheap Hat,I would not purchase this hat again. I bought it as a gift for my husband and couldn't even give it to him. It just seemed too cheap to give it as a gift.
5,Bramwell,"Excellent! You have to start at season one, you will be walked through social classes, sexism, damned determination, and love. A must see for edwardian period costumes, lifestyle, architecture, woman power, happy and sad life events. You will not be able to stop watching until you have completed all 4 dvd's. Enjoy!"
1,two words.....too loose,"Unless you have really fat feet, don't buy them. I wish Clarks did a recall on these shoes, it's dangerously loose!"
5,Last a long time,"I actually had this pair of sandals for many years. It wears well. Very comfortable. As it stretches, it gets a little looser and harder to grip as you walk. But overall, it still looks very nice and very comfortable to wear."
1,Love Indigo by Clarks but this one was a big disappointment :(,I love indigo by clarks expecially this exact sole!!! Sadly tho this particular shoe was a huge disappointment. It is adorable looking and like I said has my favorite sole by indigo but the strap around my foot was too tight and the toe strap was strangely loose. Don't let this one shoe if you have never bought indigo by clarks keep you from buying other shoes. I love all my other shoes by them!!!!
3,M&M's Shell Shocked,"This game seems difficult to me. Things move fast, especially the ride threw the first level. The factory level has alot of motion and things sneaking up on you. If you have alot of patience this could be the game for you. The color is great and characters are cute."
4,Great Game!,"I bought this as an early Christmas gift for a good friend of mine. I've never played it before, but he's a 27yo man and really enjoys playing it. I was worried that it would be too babyish but according to him it's not. Glad I found this game for him!"
3,Very noisy drive,Price is OK but noise level is bad. I have a Western Digital as my primary drive and I can immediately tell if my slave drive (Seagate 300GB) is being accessed.Speed is OK and the utilities that came with it could be useful.I use it primarily as my backup drive as I don't trust Seagate quality that much.
5,Great addition for my PC,"this HD is amazing!! all the apps are installed really fast, even if you don't have a high end CPU or a ton of RAM. I'm very satisfied with the product and the seller"
4,Off to a good start.,"I bought this drive to replace a 260GB Maxtor that died after 2 years. It had a one year warranty and the deciding factor for this drive was the 5 year warranty. Good thing my back up drive which was a year older still works.Why only 4 stars? Who knows how long this one will last? If it lasts to the end of the warranty, I'll give it 6 stars.Here are its strong points:Good manualPleasantly surprised to find it has a cloning program in the installation. Clone your existing drive for a perfect back-up.Good installation CDComes with Data and drive cables.Here are its weak points:The manual is written with some key points in tiny type. My 70 year old eyes got a bit strained.Many instructions need to be read several times before I understood the sequence to follow.They didn't remind me to Defrag and Chkdsk the old drive before cloning.Good thing I remembered. Do the Chkdsk with the /f and /r switchesAll in all, so far I am satisfied."
2,"Cute, but not informative","I purchased this book thinking it would serve as a book we could read to discuss Bebop in the jazz unit I was teaching. The book is cute and all, but it doesn't really inform the reader of the bebop style. It mentions musicians that get on the train at different stops, and these musicians make the band. That's about it."
3,so much ignored,"this is a good resource, but I there are so many better keywords in my opinion that are just ignored. a slight disappointment."
5,great piece of anime,This is a great story and well produced anime series. Not your typical crap that comes from the east pitched at prepubescent teen kids.
4,Sharp Edged Alexander the Great,"Anyone who has seen Aeon Flux will automatically know the inimitable style this story is painted across the screen. This is an uncompromising story, full of hard sharp edges where massive personalities clash as Alexander fulfills his destiny. There are many versions of Alexander the Great. This one brings him to life in (what to me is) a cyberpunk atmosphere. An entertaining video and one that might bring the story to life for teenagers more than adults."
5,Excellent video about a little known speech,"My students were surprised to learn about this event in history, and RFK's speech is a highwater mark in rhetoric and politics."
4,Excellent performance,"While I was disappointed that they didn't perform the entire Water Music, the movements that are performed are played exceptionally well: excellent musicians and period-style performance, exceptional DTS surround sound, and very visually engaging (they took great pains to re-create every aspect of the original performance of the Water Music, including full period dress and a fully-outfitted 18th century style boat that they play on while floating down the river). Highly recommended. (I would have given this 5 stars if they played the entire Water Music, but I think they were limited on time due to this originally being a BBC broadcast program)."
1,terrible,I thought this tape was a complete joke. I have a 4 year old and a 9 year old. First of all who chose the ages for the video? It is absolutely not meant for children of 3 or 4 years old. I thought it was cheesy and not well made. Don't waste your money!
1,Terrible book,"This book is absolutely terrible. Not only is it completely unintelligible, but it contains several extremely bad attempts at humor. There is no explanation as to how one is supposed to go about completing the problems at the end of each section, and the problems themselves are extremely difficult. Professors, please, do not use this terrible book. I still have nightmares about LC-2."
3,Not really suitable for photos,"I read online that matte paper was better for larger photos but the photos I printed out on this paper looked like they were printed on regular paper, so if you are looking for decent quality prints I would go for glossy paper or maybe semi-gloss at the least."
2,Not for my HP photosmart,"If you have an hp printer and are doing photos, this is not the paper for you. I would recommend Kirkland or HP paper myself."
1,NOT PHOTO PAPER,"I didn't even think to look at the reviews before I bought this because it's Canon and I love Canon...but they're matte photo paper is AWFUL. This is like card stock, nothing more. There is no matte finish to it and it looks terrible once printed on. Very disappointed with Canon."
5,Love this paper,I used this paper to print images for a photography portfolio review. The reviewer loved the paper too! Will definitely use again.
3,A little disappointed,"I can't say that this product is bad, I'm sure it is what it's suppose to be. I just wanted to clarify ""matte"" for others out there that might be as stupid as I was. I don't like glossy photo paper. When I have pictures printed I check the box for ""luster"" or ""matte"". Weeeellllll, this products ""matte"" is like cardstock only a little thinner. I am use to matte being like luster. There is absolutley NO sheen on this paper. Like I said....cardstock. So just a heads up for others like me."
3,Eh.....,"I got this paper to make my shipping on my Canon inks free. I've been super impressed with the high quality of my 4x6 prints on my Canon i960, so I was all a-flutter, thinking about how marvellous it would be in an 8.5x11!Well, it sucked. I can't tell which side of the paper is the printing side, for one. I've flipped the paper over and made sure that I tried printing on either side... and I'm just not impressed. The quality has seemed to suffer with this paper. Maybe the glossy will be better, but I'm not going to print up any more 8.5x11s... I'm not happy using that much ink on one print that doesn't look as good as I think it should."
2,Almost useless,"Don't listen to the guy who says that the photos look as good as the Photo Paper Plus on this paper.The photos look like they were printed on standard paper. The paper's just a little thicker, that's all.If that's all you're looking for, great. I was hoping for the lab-quality prints I was getting with the Photo Paper Plus. The price difference should have clued me in."
1,Not photo paper,"I agree 100% with the other reviewer that said this paper is just fancy card stock. I was looking for ""matte photo paper"" and this just looks like construction paper. I have never seen any matte professional pictures come on paper like this. What a disappointment. At least I can use this paper for my scrapbook pages and cutouts, but I wont be using it to print photos."
1,This is fancy card stock,"I bought this expecting ""premium"" Photo paper. What I got was coated card stock label ""everday heavy weight"" paper. The print quality is poor at best. Do not bother with this paper - I perfer matte but order the Canon Photo Paper Pro instead. This paper is worthless."
1,One side is yellow! DON'T buy for crafts/scrapbook,"I bought this paper to make hybrid scrapbook products and cards with. The problem is, one side of the paper is yellow and the other side is a bright white. So the bright white side prints great but the other side blurs together and tints everything a slight yellow color. I've made adjustments to printer settings and my color/brightness/contrast but to no avail. It still is poor quality and I had better luck with printer cardstock. DO NOT buy for this purpose!"
4,Product is good; service is great,"Terrific service from the seller.Perhaps it's my lack of experience with matte paper, but the results are dimmer than with glossy paper."
1,"Not photo paper, just plain card stock.","I've printed photos for over tens years and this paper is not photo quality at all. Very, very disappointing. I love all Canon's paper except this one. Truly, I am amazed they would even put their name on it as photo paper. Normally I don't believe in negative reviews and find most are user caused, but this is not the case for this item and I think we should all get our money back!"
3,OK but demands huge quantities of ink,"This paper takes a huge amount of ink. Looks fine. Won't last unless under glass, unlike the glossy. Maybe 18 months."
2,Not much better than plain paper,Most Canon photo paper is very high quality. I print to the photo paper (glossy) and photo paper plus all the time and am very happy with the results. So I was surprised that this paper is so dull. It is hard to tell which side is the printable side and the printouts are 2-dimensional and not very bright.
1,Terrible Product,"I thought I was getting matte photo paper. Inside was the equivalent of large index cards with no ""matte"" finish on them. I thought it was my fault and so I kept trying to print a good matte photo with my new Canon printer but they were flat and dull."
1,Poor Quality,"The matte photo paper that I received was really poor quality. No matter what setting my printer was set to, the ink ran together and created a really low quality photo. I do not recomend this item."
2,not photo stock,"This is NOT photo paper and should not be advertised as such. This is a thick grade of regular paper. If you want to print photos, I suggest purchasing Canon's pricier ""pro"" papers, which are more in line with what you would get if you printed your photos at any commercial outlet. This paper will do fine for school projects or business presentations."
3,Smudging after 24 hours,"I'm using this to print postcards and while the quality seems good the black text I printed still smudges after 4 days of ""drying"". I may have printed on the wrong side but as I need to print both sides, this is an issue for me and I will have to find another product.I thought this would be a slam dunk since I am using my Canon Pixma printer but no go and couldn't find any support for the paper on their consumer site."
5,Makes a nice looking print where matte surface counts,"A perfect surface for small prints that need more than the ""snapshot look"" of the glossy surface.Also it matches perfectly with the larger sizes of this surface for inexpensive test prints."
1,It's like printing on a napkin,"I'm pretty sure that whoever is buying photo paper in this size is not likely to be using it for printing documents. Except this is all this paper is good for. It's literally as thick as a few sheets of printer paper and has the exact same texture. Needless to say the color prints look absolutely awful. Canon was so embarrassed about manufacturing this crap that they didn't even put their name on the back side like they always do! Both sides are blank and you can pretty much print on either side because this paper has no coating like the real photo paper.I've literally wasted my money on it. The only thing I use it for is making test-prints if my printer has been sitting untouched for a while. Unless you plan on using it the same way this product makes absolutely no sense. For just a few dollars more you can get some heavy-weight photo paper with coating, so don't even bother with this."
1,Not a quality product,"I love matte photos, and I wanted to believe the people who bought this and said it is an excellent product. However, I used it and indeed, it is like using regular paper only a little thicker. Please don't waste your money on this product; I have already returned it thirty minutes after receiving it."
1,Canon Paper Not For High Quality Photos,"Canon Photo Paper Matte, 13 x 19 Inches, 20 Sheets (7981A011)I do a lot of landscape photo printing on 13 x 19 paper on a Canon Pro9000 Mark II printer. This Canon matte paper is the worst I have used for quality photos. The printer produces a very dull print using this paper, but when I use matte paper I buy from a local Staples on the same settings I get a very nice print. I corresponded with Canon on this and they wanted me to try various settings using their program, but I got the same poor results. I finally gave up on this paper and cannot recommend it for quality photo printing even though it says on the package that it produces vibrant colors. In my experience, It does not. I find I get the best results on landscape photos from Canon Photo Paper Plus Semi-gloss. Prints from this paper are always outstanding."
1,Not photo paper,"As a professional photographer for over 40 years, I could not believe that Canon would pass off card stock as photo paper, but it is TRUE! This is not photo paper, don't waste your money on it. I used 1 sheet and I want to find out how to get a refund on a product that is not what it is advertised to be."
1,Terrible!,I should have done some more research....I feel like I bought a big pile of card stock! I won't be using this.....
1,THIS PAPER SUCKS,no real photograqpher would consider this photo paper - It is not Matte either - it is just heavy copy paper for arts & crafts totally misrepresented
1,Not photo paper.,"I should have believed the plethora of reviews stating that this is cardstock, not photo paper. I thought ""Canon can't be deceiving loyal customers who just spent hundreds of dollars on a new printer."" I was wrong."
3,matte paper,"This paper prints very high quality photo work, it is heavy enough to make card models from if that interests you. The price works out to about $0.20US per sheet which is high for card models but very good for photo paper."
2,"more like poster board, not photo paper","If you have ever gotten poster board for a school project, this is what you get in a small form. It's terrible. I suppose if you are using it for a school project then it would be great to print on, if you don't mind sacrificing the quality of whatever you are trying to print. I read a previous review stating that it drinks up ink and you can see that when your photo is printed. It left big ink spots on the photo that did not disappear when it dried. It's exactly as it would be if I put poster board in my printer, minus the slight shine. I take my own pictures of my son instead of taking him in and I am a huge scrapbooking fan, hence the reason I bought matte paper; it looks nicer behind a frame and doesn't get the same glare off of it and it looks a little more professional. I would rather drive to fred meyer than waste my ink on this. Spend the extra money and buy nicer paper."
1,card stock,"This is nothing more than card stock!!! totally disappointed! If you are looking for true photo matte paper, this is not what you are looking for."
5,great product,"I love the matte paper compared to the glossy and this product gives me great pictures! I'm sure some could argue that having a professional photo developing store would be better, but for the snapshots I take and the money I save printing photos at home, I am very satisfied with this paper!"
3,How to tell which side to print,"This paper is quite light weight and soft but the prints on it are quite Ok. I will not recommend it for any serious photography prints. I have equivalent paper from Epson and that one is more thick and stiff.People are asking how to figure out which side to print on. While the side that is whiter is the printing side on this paper, a general test for all coated paper (almost all photography paper) is below.With a wet finger feel the surface of paper slightly. If your finger sticks a little, it is the printing surface. The other side will not stick. Although touching the surface does not affect the paper (if your finger is not dirty), you may still want to do this test on a corner."
2,Thin.. Hard to tell which side to print on.,"This paper is thin. I printed a picture of a sunset and the paper came out wavy as if it was over saturated with ink. Yes, all of the settings were correct on my printer (canon pro 9000). I have not had this type of problem with other photo paper, but for the price you get what you pay for.As for which side to print on, it says you need to print on the ""whiter"" side. That's impossible to figure out if the room lighting isn't super white. I use my bathroom lighting to figure out which side is correct."
4,Good quality for good results,"I have been using this paper quite regularly. I am a graphic designer and I often print out proofs for my clients for logos, business cards etc on this paper with my inkjet Canon printer. The results are always good and the paper is heavy enough to be used for this purpose. My only objection is that the backside of the paper has a lightly darker tone (almost invisible, but it's there) and when I need to print it double sided, I am not so happy with having a slightly darker paper on one side. But overall, I would definitely recommend it"
2,It's more like cardstock than photo paper,"I think the finish is what it should be - matte. However, the paper actually kind of curled when it came out of the printer because it seemed like it couldn't hold up to the amount of ink. I am a avid cardmaker and have used cardstock that is heavier weight than this photo paper. I think if it was a heavier weight, I would have liked it more. It just feels too flimsy for me to bother with purchasing this paper again. And I love matte photos so I guess I will have to send these out to a developer when I need matte again."
3,"very disappointed at first, but looks good inside a photo frame","When I first opened the package, I was horrified, as this paper has NO LUSTER AT ALL !!! I looks like a normal document paper which is slightly thicker. When I took the print though, the picture came out sharp and clear, not sure whether its only because of printer, or some credit goes to this bad boy. Still, the print by itself looked way too matty. But after I put it inside a photo frame, it looks perfect. the gloss from the glass makes up for the lack of sheen, and you cant tell at all that the print is a completely matte one.Hence, to cut the long story short, I would recommend this product for art and craft, or for framing (in a glass photo frame)."
1,not good...,the Matte photo paper is different from what I think it should be....the result is much different from the Matte photo from the outside photo print studio...I only try out one...I wouldn't use it anymore...
2,pictures look like regular printer paper,"i get the whole ""matte"" thing... but this paper is not good enough for metry the semi-gloss, it will get you a bit of shine on the paper to make the color of photos look better. not like they were printed on standard paper.And black and white pics? forget about it!"
5,Fantastic,A fantastically intriguing book written by a very gifted man. Definitely a must read for believers and nonbelievers alike.
3,Full of Surprises,"After reading One Last Time I was expecting more of an intense format. The book was not intense, until perhaps the ending. I was confused in the beginning as to who was narrating the story. That didn't come together for me until the end because the story actually has two narrators. What surprised and delighted me about this book is the chapter in which this psychic medium describes in detail what the other side is like for us when we cross over. Although I was frustrated when one narrator switched to the other without explanation, the ending left me feeling very satisfied and comfortable. Knowing now who is narrating when, I would enjoy the book more the second time around."
1,Simplistic,"Simplistic and not nearly as good as his nonfiction books about his real life. His real experiences are so amazing that I can't imagine why he would feel a need to make up a story like this, which is sweet but simplistic and not at all unusual. He's a pyschic, not a writer, and he should stick with telling his excellent real stories based on his amazing life.(I have similar reactions to Chopra's fiction. Why do these spiritually talented people feel a need to move into fiction?)"
5,Ultimate Comfort,"Having recently lost a beloved sister I was in need of solace. This book certainly provided that. Others have called it juvenile. I call it lovely, simply lovely. When I finished I was more convinced than ever that there is a force greater than ourselves and although we may be afraid to leave this life, there is something far grander waiting for us. My thanks to the author. He brought peace to my soul."
5,In Reply to SIMPLISTIC,"I think What If God Were the Sun is a true story. Not word for word. But I felt as I read the book that somehow, this story relates to the real life and thoughts of the author. I could be wrong. But I sure couldn't help but ""feel"" that through out the book. Reread the book with this thought in mind..."
4,John takes you into his home,"If you're a big fan of John Edward then you'll enjoy this book. It's a fiction, but it has some strong similarities to his life (at least as a boy). You'd probably enjoy it more if you read it after ""One Last Time"" (his first book)."
2,"Nothing new here, except written in story style","I have read previous books by Edwards but this one is nothing new, there were spelling erros and the content was similar to other books. I think author needs some more experience in telling a story, am sure he will"
2,How can I be saying this?,"I watch John Edward any chance I get on t.v. and gain so much comfort that the life energy does not end but transform. The ending of this book was the most disappointing thing for me. All of a suddent the character ""crossed over"" and there was everyone who had gone before him, even his childhood dog...like they had all been sitting around in some giant living room in their funeral clothes waiting... everything was just the same as in life, only somewhere else. Maybe I was looking for a revelation and I was willing to stretch for it too...but then the ending was very clear and unsatisfactory. There seeem to be many people who loved the book and I'm glad they got something from it but I was disappointed...but only by the book...not John's work."
3,What if God were the sun,"A very enjoyable, fast read. I think John Edward really is a very talented writer."
2,A Sad Disappointment,"I am an unabashed John Edward fan, both of his television series and his other books. While his other books are decently written, flow well, and are informative and interesting, ""What if God Were the Sun"" was a terrible disappointment. This novel is written in a decidedly juvenile style with one-dimensional, uninteresting characters, a distinct impression the reader is being spoken down to (or perhaps has recently been kicked in the head by a mule), and a thin and predictable plot which makes slogging to the book's end a bit of a groan and a chore. Had there been a remarkable message, keen insight, or a riviting inspirational relevation, the shoddy writing might be excused. Sadly, that is not the case here. Do buy John's other books, but skip this one. John, bless him, should stick to non-fiction."
5,Enlightening,"I have to admit as I was reading through the book I was swept away into feeling what the writer was revealing....and then an awful thing happened~ My husband read ahead and told me that the book was labeled fiction. ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, anyhow, I had to get back into fiction mode and realized just how much more talented this guy really is. I am now reading 'Crossing Over' which I love better because he reveals real stories. I love his style of writing, ...it's like J.D. Salinger, I am there listening to him talking to me!! (...)"
5,Helps with Gout,"This is a wonderful product that prevents my husband's gout from flaring up. If he misses a day that is okay, but if he misses a week, it flares up. So I know this product works!"
3,Misleading ad,"This product is not 100 capsules of 1500 mg each, as the ad may lead you to believe. It is 1500 mg per serving and each serving is specified as 3 capsules."
4,Baron Barclay Bridge Cards,Everything on Amazon's side of the operation was top notch. The cards themselves are of a lesser quality than what used to be available through the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL).
1,spots on back,Some of the cards have white spots on the back. I use the cards at home and hope that no one notices!
3,Not Bad,"I finished this book in 2 sittings; I found it riveting and touching without being the least bit maudlin or far-fetched. The heroine, Marie, still subjected to the torturous memories of her past, has the chance to make a difference in the life of a young child; her determined actions force the plot to move as rapid and dangerously as whitewater and simultaneously flood hope into her own life and that of an interested young police officer. Quite good!Reserve this one for an otherwise quiet evening!"
5,WOWWWWW!,"ALL I CAN SAY IS WOWWWW! WHAT AN AWESOME VIDEO! I AM SO GLAD TO SEE SUCH A MASTERPIECE WORK DONE ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT. YOU GOTTA HAVE THIS. IT IS INTERESTING, WELL DONE, INFORMATIVE - VERY UNIQUE! I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THIS VIDEO HAS WON SOME MAJOR AWARDS...I AM SO GLAD I OWN IT NOW!"
5,Black Fly Sun glasses,"I hunted high and low and these are the only sunglasses I wear, Great price for polerizedBlack Flys Micro Fly Sunglasses (Black)"
3,product just a lttle short of expectation,"Seller Service: Excellent. Product arrived on time and in great condition.Product Satisfaction: The overall look is good. The finish is a nice shiny cherry gloss. The bottom of the box is felt lined (dark colour). The inside is nicely sized and accommodates all my medium sized watches comfortably. The cover on the top is some kind of a hard see-through plastic-like material. The clasp in front doesn't lock with a key - it is just a regular clasp.One thing that is extremely irksome is the fact that the lid keeps falling shut, when I try to keep the box open for a few minutes."
4,This is a beautifully detailed and suspenseful book.,"Lost Battalion is a great account and enlightened view of what happened to the 1st Air Cav's 2/12 during the TET offensive of 1968 at Hue and how its division leaders overshot their capabilities. The NVA beautifully executed a plan of attach. Who did it cost? The common soldier. A whole battalion left out to dry with no support from one of the best supplied divisions in Vietnam. Krohn's only shortcoming is that there is no account or point-of-view from the common foot soldier who suffered the most at the hands of poor generalling from Norton & the division hdqrts. This book helps amplify our understanding of the war if read in conjunction with other books like Bright & Shining Lie, Fortunate Son, The Things They Carried & Song of Napalm, for examples. -jack wright, 1st Cav 1966-67"
1,don't waste your money on this book!,"This book was horrible! The author copied the writing style of Eric Jerome Dickey and not in a good way. It starts off with Nat begin so in love with his wife, but yet he still cheats on her with his best friend girl. Tayilor and Nat are suppose to be ""soul mates"". Yeah right"":(Nat's wife is Tayilor and her best friends doctor, but she doesn't know her own patient is sleeping with her husband. I would strongly recommend that if you do want to read this book, get it from the library. It would be a waste of money to buy it."
5,One of the BEST books I have ever read!!!!,"This book was one of the best books I have ever read! I had passed this book up in the book store once and went back to get it after I kept thinking about it. Boy, am I glad that I did. It freaked the crap out of me but at the same time made me think a whole lot. I have never read a book like this before! I am reading this book again just because. It made me think if things like this exist in real life or can it really happen. Its an amazing book! I would recommend anyone with an open mind to definitely read this. If I could meet the author and start a discussion board about this book I would. It took me a while to write this review because I'm too lazy to write them but I read this book a few months ago and still think about it alot. T.P. Carter is definitely A GREAT AUTHOR!"
4,Excellent,"Its kind of confusing in the first chapter but it all comes together in the end. This is one of the best stories I have ever read. I like the fact that its about two people that have a connection but try to keep it in check. In the end, its too much and they end up together but at a price."
5,PhotoShopped,"Thorough study, which is just what I need to do! Now I have a textbook and, consequently, a useful program."
1,I wasn't lucky.,"It didn't work. The time and cost of sending it back isn't worth it. It would have been handy, but I can do without it,One other thing. The battery this unit uses isn not one you are likely to find in your local supermarket."
2,Nothing new.,"For those who have been a part of this debate for sometime, you will find this book quite disappointing - especially if you are a Calvinist. What the authors have to say is exactly what you can predict any Arminian to say. ""John 3:16 says 'world,' therefore God loves everyone the same."" ""Romans 9 is all about nations."" ""God hardened Pharaoh's heart because Pharaoh hardened his own heart first."" ""We have to have libertarian free will or we are robots and God can't love us."" If you are looking for real exegesis of key biblical texts, you will not find it. If you are looking for some fresh arguments from the Arminian camp, do not buy this book."
4,Even a Reforming Christian likes this book...,"...and here's why: It's one of the better anti-Calvinist books around. The authors are sincere and clear. They present the basics of Reformed theology well. Reformed Christians *should* read this book if they are not already familiar with these arguments.The best the authors can do, however, is say that (many) Calvinists are not consistent. (Outside the book, this is evidenced by the fact that many will identify themselves as ""4-point"" or ""3-point"" Calvinists, which makes little sense.) So if you are Reformed, you should struggle with these issues as well and clarify your own beliefs. If you are a ""consistent"" Calvinist (not hyper-, by the way), you have nothing to fear from this book."
4,To add to the Debate....,"This is a very good book to add to the debate of Calvinism and Arminianism. At times the book tends to get a little lost in the ""meat"" of certain discussion points but if you muddle through you will come out the smarter for it. No matter what side of the debate you find yourself this is necessary read to be informed in the debate and not sound like a theological idiot."
5,Why I must write a review...,"Walls and Dongell do what just about no one else has: put down the great theological divide on paper without putting down the great theologians. They also grab the complex difficulties of the rift, and phrase it in easily attainable verbage.I have been around many a Calvinists and Arminian, and my experience is that the Calvinists are much more condescending and denegrating than the Arminians. Walls and Dongell, however, take no mean-spirited or cheap shots. In fact, they give Calvinists credit while nicely displaying why Arminianism is a much more Biblical-rational approach. Indeed, I just slammed Calvinism, now, more than Walls and Dongell do all tolled.If you're Arminian, this will give you the sound, Biblical ideology to wrap your theological hands around.If you're a Calvinists, do not read this book because it will give you a tough decision: Remain true to your school or do the right thing, and convert to Arminianism...it has been preordained!"
5,Nice treatment of the debate,Buy Why I Am Not an Arminian to balance the debate. We used both books as textbooks in a Bible study class.
5,!,"This is propably the best Macbeth who has been recordet. Cappuccilli is a real Macbetto bariton, I have heard the EMI and RCA Victor records and Milnes and Warren do not come close to Cappuccilli. Piero Cappuccilli brings the tragety near to Shakespeare's Macbeth. Verrett is also very good, she has that smoky-tone which is the best one for Lady Macbeth. The sleepwalking scene is one of the greatist things in opera. Nicolai Ghiaurov is very good, he has an good song-tecnic. Placido Domingo brings an very good, if not the best, Macduff to the record. Claudio Abbado, one of the best Macbeth's conductor, he go's deep into the music and finds all the gread Verdi-detale's. The record has an gread sound and is probably the best Macbeth record."
1,Benchley's worst.,"I enjoy reading novels from Peter Benchley but when I say The Island is awful, I mean it. The story is basically about a group of modern-day pirates pillaging people on boats. Trust me, it's terrible."
2,A disappointment.,"A sailing yarn, replete with modern-day pirates looting ships and killing their crews. A sure winner by the author of JAWS and THE DEEP? Nope. This one had a flimsy plot, little character development, and an ending that seemed hurried. It's an okay read for a dull day, but this might be his weakest work."
1,Sadism,"I finished the book but admit to doing a lot of skimming. The story is unbelievable. I did not appreciate the graphic violence. The main character is an utterly irresponsible father, which made me dislike him. The happenings on the Island are just weird--felt like it was trumped up sensationalism. To me the book, starting with the main character's researcher, displayed sadism. It may be one of the worst books I have ever read. The plot was not thought out, the action rushed, the son's mother dealt with ""painfully"". Ugh! I will not read another Peter Benchley."
3,A decent read,"I haven't read this book in over 10 years, but I felt compelled to write something about it because there have been no reviews thus far. I was about 14 when I read it, and I enjoyed it then, but I don't know if I would being that I am in my twenties. I thought that there were some very astute observations about the very idea of ""civilization"" and that it was a very original plot."
3,Undecided...,"After watching Pirates of the Carribean i pulled this one off my shelf where it had been collecting dust for a decade...(I bought it after reading Jaws) The Idea of this book is pretty interesting: a man arrives at an island where the people have not ""evolved"" and are basically still living the life of pirates and do not conform to modern values...There is a hidden treasure of course... but not one we might expect... The problem with this otherwise fine boook is that too much time is speant on the relationship between the protagonist and his son and the troubles in their relationship and not enough time dealing witht he pirates and the seamonsters...Imagine ""Jaws"" with Chief Brody's son on board bickering instead of ""sharking"" and you will get my point...All in all not a bad read, but ""Jaws"" and ""The Beast"" are much more satisfying..."
3,"Interesting concept, weak presentation.","Peter Benchley's The Island certainly has an interesting idea, the pirates of old are still around and are largely responsible for most of the missing boats in the Bermuda Triangle. Benchley attempts to weave real history with contemporary fantasy, but the results are mixed. The beginning and ending are action packed and suspenseful, but the middle part drags horribly and the pirates way of life does not seem capable of real life survival outside the pages of a pulp novel. Watered down adventure from the author of Jaws."
3,Fairly entertaining,"A quick read & a fairly enjoyable story. It has a little bit of comedy, a touch of romance/sex, and plenty of narcotics/booze involved. It's basically a ""whodunit"" in a Southern setting. The mystery aspect is almost like a background story in this book. It takes a look at adolescents/young adults and their lives. The main characters are trying to make a living by not working and just partying 24/7. Not the most original or best piece of fiction I've ever read, but it is amusing."
3,chairs are uncomfotable,I bought these chairs because they were a perfect match to the table I also purchased through Amazon. The chairs are very uncomfortable and won't hold up to kids. Since we only use the set for a quick meal it's ok for us but I wouldn't want to linger over a long meal in these chairs.
3,Chair review,"This product was great once they were put together. The chairs came and one chair part was completly cracked in half. The companyt did replace the piece right away so that was great!! Putting the chairs together really stressed both me and my husband out, the parts just did not fit together easily. But once the chairs were together they are wonderful and sturdy!!!"
1,Can't even power on without Car Kit,"Disregard the product description where it says the car kit is included. It isn't. The kits will cost you 60.00 additional (not sold at amazon). You can't even plug in the GPS without the car kit, so its useless without it.If you think you can buy an aftermarket PDA holder, guess again, since the kit TomTom car kit is the only thing that will make this whole thing work."
1,DON'T BUY!!!!,"If you want to use it with a Dell PDA don't buy it! The PDA will freeze every hour. If you want to use it with other PDA, don't buy it.It is impossible to upgrade this excuse of a software. I've been calling around for a week now, to upgrade from navigator 5 Scandinavia to Europe, with no luck.Tomtom support is the WORST I've even seen. They treat customers like s...! If you want a heart attack, just call their support line, they will take care of it.They should spend money on customer care not voice of John Cleese.I will never buy a tomtom product again in my life!"
2,A big disappointment,"Being a national floral design teacher and international competitor, I asked for this book as a Christmas present. I was intrigued with the title, ""A Master Guide to the Art of Floral Design."" The jacket promised that it was ""directed toward the advanced designer."" It's not.The book has lovely photography of plant materials, some taken in the naturally beautiful surroundings of Filoli. It also has some good botanically-oriented illustrations. However, the subject matter and designs are definitely for a beginner."
3,"Pretty book to look at it, but is not a ""how to"" instructional.",I purchase this book because of previous reviews and I was expecting an instructional book describing in detail how to do flower arrangements designs; but this is not the book for it. It is just pretty to look at it and it has some nice abtract designs but nothing that will contribute to the learning process of flower arragements.
5,Using this theory for my dissertation,"This book is so well written, I've truly enjoyed reading the book while working on my dissertation. I'm excited to use it as my theory and am using it in presentations I'm doing on other topics. GREAT text!"
2,Longwinded and poorly organized,"With all the glowing reviews I had high expectations of this book. I'm certain there are some nuggets of wisdom in here, but it's a lot of work to dig them out. I'm glad I just rented this from the library."
3,This was a nice study for our group,"Over all this was a nice study for our group, and a good way to approach Hebrews and James. However, at the end of chapter 6 (p.46); the author allows an unnecessary, unwarranted, and unsound venture into Evangelical Feminism. I am always amazed at how so many otherwise sound projects and authors just can not help themselves and have to input some form of political correctness based on a current political philosophy. This author makes this mistake at this one point, and it is startling, because the rest of the book is a fine work."
3,Hebrews for all.,"This is generally a sound guide for Hebrews. However, at the end of chapter 6 (p.46); the author allows an unnecessary, unwarranted, and unsound venture into Evangelical Feminism. Aside from that; I found the book useful."
4,Great sound but don't believe the picture,"I think the sounds are piercing and something you will hear above a lot of talking. I plan on using it in a classroom to gain students' attention. My only complaint is that I thought I was getting three separate chime blocks. Instead they are connected, which is okay but it isn't what the picture showed or what I expected."
3,Out of tune?,"I purchased these chimes to use in school when teaching - they are attractive and sturdy - BUT when played in succession, they are out of tune, to most people's ears. They were much less expensive than other chimes - I wonder if that's because they don't sound great?"
3,4-Track Not-Quite-Classics,"One of GBV's more rustic sounding releases, fans will nevertheless want this to have recordings of ""Matter Eater Lad"" and ""Johnny Appleseed"", two great songs that occasionaly make it onto GBV setlists. The combination of very chaotic performances (by Bob & Jim Pollard & Tobin Sprout) with imaginative uses of feedback make it a very distinct, if somewhat annoying, experience. Maybe a star should be added here for originality, but that could be said of any GBV offering. It's probably the lesser of their mid-90's 7"" EPs."
4,Rama Lama,"Rocky and the Replays deserved much more fame and success than they achieved. All of them bring something to the table, and Rocky was a real talent. Helen's clear voice really completes the group. This is a must for your collection, as are all of Rocky Sharpe and the Replays albums! Go to You Tube to see video of some of their live performances. You will become a fan!"
1,...,"Personally I didn't like it and my piercing started to get infected although I disinfected it and cleaned my piercing. Didn't happen with my other jewelry, just this one."
5,A great card for the price (..that I paid),I bought this card last year to replace my VisionTek Geoforce2 card;...I have had 0(Zero) problems with it. It performs wonderfully on my computer and has not had a problem with any game so far (over 50). I've updated the drivers once last year with no ill effects and I have rebuilt my computer and it still works fine. Why are some people complaining and having so much trouble?? Beats me.
1,Karloff Fans Should Avoid This Turkey,"The infamous Mexican horror movies that ended Boris Karloff's career remain among his worst. Filmed in 1968 but released a few years after the veteran actor's death, ""The Fear Chamber"" is truly wretched cinema and painful to sit through. Regardless of the financial rewards, dear Boris should have stayed home and not subjected himself to this exploitation fodder."
3,Haven't read it,Needed this book for class and I haven't read any of it yet so I found it fair to rate it a 3.
3,What you see is what you get,"Nothing too much to say, is ok. Unfortunately it does not fit well to the car. Is not strong enough.Much better is buy a surf rack."
2,Not a good idea if you have a nice Car,"Let me start off by saying that if I had a turd car I would have kept this Wrap Rack. It works really good and looks nice. The problem I had was it was on my Volvo XC60R with flush rails and it took the paint off one of them. Not Happy. This happened after the first use and scratched my roof. It is not the product but more just the design.. Salt water,sand,25lb paddle board sitting on your roof rubbing back and forth on every bump and turn. It was a no brainer to send it back.I ended up buying a THULE complete rack system w Paddle board carrier ( $700 bucks )but my car will not get damaged."
4,Spacious,"The surf board rack is great for 2 surfboards and can fit up to 4, but it's a little tight at that point. I hate having to redo and undo the straps all the time but there's no great way around that. Otherwise, one of my beefs is that the black rack gets covered with surfboard wax easily."
4,came with free cd,The disc came with a free CD. The free CD had mold in it.more words more words more words more freakin words.
4,dependable,the EVGA e-GeForce 7600GS 512 MB PCIe Video Card with Fan is a very dependable card and sli with another one it is fast enough for todays games
1,3 Capacitors blew out at the same time after 10 months of use,"I bought this card because I wanted DVI input for my LCD monitor. The picture was greatly improved over analog. This card does not run Medal of Honor well and Runs Call to Duty poorly. I was somewhat hesitant to put a card in my computer that has a fan but with some trepidation I did it anyway. That fear was realized this morning when my monitor was blank and my office had a faint electrical fire odor. Shortly thereafter the computer shut itself down. I opened it up and removed the card and there it was, a frozen fan and 3 blown capacitors. The tops of the capacitors were actually exploded at the top. I am very happy that the motherboard circuit breakers worked and saved my system. I would not recommend this product."
4,stretch jeans,"I've have looking for Wrangler stretch jeans since I bought my last pair, which seems like eons ago and can only find them online.The purchase I made went very well and I had my merchandise within days of the order.This is the only way to go if products can't be found in the stores - online shopping."
3,"Made in China, not as good as made-in-Germany Rosle","We bought one Rosle zester and one WMF julienne slicer because we would like to compare the quality of those two brands. The Rosle zester is made in Germany and has a better quality and fine finish. The steel is slightly heavier. It is sharp and creates beautiful zest perfect for garnish. The made-in-China WMF julienne slicer works well, however, the finish and steel quality is inferior to that of Rosle, making it look cheap. With a price tag of 17 USD, we expected the WMF slicer to be German-made and to be of at least the same quality as that of Rosle.From this experience, we decide that we better invest in Rosle tools than WMF."
1,"Be careful, might not be the ""sound"" for you","I really enjoy the Ministry of Sound series, one of my favorites being the MoS High NRG Anthems cd, this cd although left me very dissapointed.It has an incredible lack of energy, there is no trancy sound, no euro sound, no nothing sound. This is generally the problem with American music anyways.If you like mellow music, while this is still danceable it just isnt like gushing with energy. It is a weaker dance cd. Anywho, just be careful if you like more of the high energy pumping trancy stuff, this cd isn't for you."
2,Mediocre at best,I purchased this based on the other reviews. I wish I hadn't. It's neither deep nor sexy.
2,English not spoken here.,"Unless you can understand English as it is spoken poorly by many Englishpersons, I would not recommend. After investing so much time in Prime Suspect, I gave up completely. Minutes would go by when I couldn't understand a single word, e.g., the sequence with the interview of the transvestite. This problem persists quite strongly today in Masterpiece Theater. I have removed it from my DVR scheduling. I have not seen any of her shows in this set but I am not going to take a chance, Mirren is the worst in this respect! She seems to revel in mumbling her lines, as if articulation was a no-no to such a 'sophisticate'. I will never forgive Mirren for ruining any possibility of enjoyment in Prime S."
3,Very Rough Game But Fun,"It is a fun game but the game is programmed VERY VERY VERY rough. It seems they rushed the game into release or something. Graphics aren't even close to acceptable. Player faces are very vague, it literally looks like a fat dou being pinched into a human face. While the game play is barely acceptable but you can shoot 3s inside 3 pt line, you can shoot a ball behind board when it is physically impossible. In general, only a playable game. I have never been a EA sports game fan anyway. Most of them sucked. For basketball, I recommend 2002 or 2003 NBA LIVE for XBOX. In my opinion, they are more like real life basketball."
4,Magnifico,"I haven't played this game since NBA Live 98, and man it really has chanced a lot. I have a 128MB video card, kind of expected awesome graphics, but I wasn't impressed, for that 4 stars.In sound I give it 5 stars. Cool soundtracks. I just love Mr. Albert saying ""three pointer... Yes!""The gameplay requires more thinking, is not as easy as dunking everytime you want. Now you have to run plays to score.This is a must have game!"
1,PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this game last week and there is a serious virus attached to CD 2 that comes out when loading! The virus causes the game to lock up your system-ctrl-alt-del and task manager do not work during the lock up. I unplugged the system and tried to reboot and get a blank black screen now. My ststem will not load up in safe mose or any of the other default boot modes. I scanned the disk in another computer I have access to and found there is a virus detected on disk 2. The EA tech support board reflects this problem as well if you don't believe me. This game just ruined a brand new system-do not buy this thing whatever you do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
4,Quite a pleasure.,"First, it's quite reallistic. The defensive champions Spurs have their system based on defensive rebound. And that's true, they get all the defensive rebounds. On the other hand, the opponent point-guard scores too much, too easily and that's not reallistic."
4,The German Musical Star,"Although Uwe Kroeger is THE star in Germany and Austria, he is plainly unknown in the U.S.A. His CD has some of the best musical tunes I know on it, in great new arrangements. They're fast and his voice is rich and passionate as always, however, I feel he didn't look for anything new, he just reused his old tunes."
1,"There is a ""Real"" Copy of ""Fragments From France"" Available","Most attempts made to produce a faithful digital version of ""Fragments From France"" fall flat. They either contain no illustrations or are ill-formatted. If you want a properly formatted Kindle edition of this excellent book check out::Fragments From France - Illustrated - Official Kindle EditionThis great book without the illustrations is basicly worthless. When it has the illustrations and properly formatted like the one found through the provided link above, it is a wonderful gem! Check it out."
1,A RIP-OFF!,"Although I am fortunate enough to own an original copy of this book, I thought it would be nice to have on my kindle. At $3.88 its not a tremendous amount of $$, but still a GREAT dissappointment! Bairnsfather was the Bill Mauldin of WWI, but all you get in this ""publication"" are the captions under the original art, NOT the drawings themselves!!! One HUGE RIP-OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,A bit dissapointing,"I own one of the origional copies, but without the actual drawings this book was a bit dissapointing. Anyway I can still read it now and then"
3,So So,"Third rate filming. The cars were good , but the film equipment they used was third rate. Actors not bad"
1,!Sinverguenza!,"This had a threadbare storyline; the characters make stupid decisions; and this film was just a waste of time. One actor who played a simple role in ""American Me"" is put upon a pedestal and worshipped like he were Ruben Blades, Benicio del Toro, or some other major LatinO actor. I loved the Southwest unity here where the script shows Cali, Arizona, and Texas. There are many tomboyish girls and butch women here. Maybe androgyny is celebrated or understood in ""cholo"" culture, but this dynamic stands out and no character ever discusses it. Maybe I had a defective copy, but many actors' voices could not be heard. Really, you'd heard background music, one person talking, and another person's lips just moving. If I didn't have the subtitles on I would have had no idea what they were saying. Maybe this is the result of low-budget films where they can't reshoot when a microphone isn't working. Do not waste two hours of your life seeing this. This could be the worst ""ese"" film ever made."
1,Tell it to the Forum,Can we spell ego mania? This is the most absurd book of platitudes Ive ever laid hands on I want my money back!!!! EST Forum and now Dan Pallotta ................YIKES
5,We learn from others.,"This book teaches that human beings are naturally dreamers and that the key to happiness is kindness, and living your calling. But what is your calling? Through exercises in self-reflection, Dan asks you to recall your child's imagination, an imagination without boundaries. Once you understand your life's calling or dream, go for it. Dan illustrates how dreamers (Olympic athletes, Walt Disney, Martin Luther King Jr.) inspire others but also attract cynics. The bigger your dream, the more cynics will try to discourage you and try to stop you... This book teaches you to understand your dreams, commit to them, and do them. It teaches you to make kindness part of your life. It teaches you to become a citizen of the world and take action for the global good. You have to be cynic to discourage such noble actions. This is a great book. If it doesn't inspire you, you need more love, kindness,and compassion in your life - you are the cynic."
2,A Very Human-centric view of Paradise!,"While Mr. Pallotta can be inspiring at times, I am dissappointed his philosophy of life isn't as compelling. We live on a planet that is being destroyed on a daily basis. While it is a grand and compassionate idea to save every person whether from AIDS or suscide there is no thought given to the world all these people will inhabit. The only grand thought given to the environment it to consider shrinking all people to miniature size??? I wish someone with so much drive would look more at the root causes of many of these problems such as poverty. To hold a health ride/walk to raise money to experiment on animals to find health cures while still serving unhealthy meals on the rides seems counter productive. The world is more than just humans. I hope even our dreamers realize this in time!"
3,What's important besides Ana?,"Not as professionally staged or shot as other live performances. Does not have sub-titles, so you'd have to be a speaker of Spanish to get the full enjoyment. But if you are a fan of Ana Gabriel, will this matter?"
4,explendido concierto,"una excelente recopilacion de esta increible artista, con algunas omisiones. fue una lastima que el sonido no ofreciera una mayor calidad para sus fanaticos"
3,ana gabriel en la plaza de toros mexico,"Ana pueder ver dejado las canciones en rock Y cantar las canciones tradicional con Mariachi. Porque Ana no practico sus bailes y movidas? Bailerina,nos es."
1,NOT A MUSICAL VIDEO AT ALL!,"It's just a biographical video piece on Larry Harlow, as a puerto rican growing in the bronx in the 70's I can relate to Harlow's contribution to the music. However this video IS NOT musical at all. It's about music but, It does not contain music as it's being marketed. I was very dissapointed. It [also was not the price i expected to pay]. I'm sorry I had to return it."
3,slow and not upgradable,it says it is a 1GB Ethernet but i cant get it up to thatit is only 100MB regular Ethernet speedalso it is not upgradeableif you want to connect an external hard drive it should be first formated to the old FAT32and so you cannot use files that are larger than 4 GB which they are lot these daysfinal wordsif you need it for very very standard home useit is OKotherwisefind another
2,This E-book on Kinematic Classes are lacking.,This E-Book lacks real world examples on how to implement the classes. The functions they provide can be taken from any book on this subject.I don't highly recommend this one.Don H.
4,The Little Red Book,"This small book is packed with information. I ordered it for my 16 year old bassoon player to help him with classical music phrases. It contains those and much more. Biographies of composers, musical terms, it's all there. A good choice for students of music. Somewhat lacking, however, in obscure foreign classical terms, especially in languages other than Italian."
3,Its ok.,I'm not sure but I think there is a newer version. While taking some music classes at a Community Collage some of our terms were not in this book.
1,PNY customer service and warranty problems,"I don't own this particular PNY card but read this anyway:Don't buy any PNY product in the US without reading the full warranty. ""Lifetime Replacement Warranty"" is not what you would think. It is not the usual graphics card life and not the lifetime of the original purchaser. Go to PNY's website and read the fine print. The warranty MIGHT last a year as they define it.My PNY Verto TI4200 AGP 64 card lasted only 14 months. It was the shortest lived graphics card I ever owned. You MUST have an RMA number to return it. And just try to get Tech Support. Hours on the phone get you only perpetual hold and no relief for your woes. Their email is just as bad."
4,Great Card one downside,"This card is GREAT, no flaws, except for one, LIKE ALL video cards the clock speed on the 128 MB cards are a bit screwy, even for ATI video cards, I personally love this card and can't wait to get the new ""GeForce FX"" that was shown off a bit ago.. Overall the best Card out there except for the 9700 pro and this is the best card if you only have 4x agp.."
5,Sweet Card,"I could not ask for a better card. This card handles all of todays best 3D graphic games. Nothing I can throw at it, even Quake 3, Soldier of Fortune, Medal of Honor or Matrix can make this card break a sweat. It doesn't matter if its online playing or not. I have owned at least 7 different graphic cards from different companies, and this is the first time I am truely satisfied. I finally have no need to upgrade. This card rules for even the most demanding gamer."
3,Ok I think,"I just returned this card for Rodeon 8500, after I did some studies about these two cards.The G4 was just not worth the money I think, [amazon.com]did not even ask me why I wanted to make exchange. Very good service at [amazon.com] #1ATI DRIVERS ARE GETTING BETTER AND BETTER EACH MONTH!Now It looks like ATI make even better drivers from Nivida,very happy with rodeon 8500 128 DDR, cheap and the perfomane is alsmost the same as Geforce 4 top Notch form Nivida. Soon ATI will realise Rodeon 9700 Will come out on july 18!(50% improvment over 8500 in perfomance) Which will blow all Nividas card into Dust for good!Rodeon Kicks Butt!"
4,Great value and works wonderfully,Good quality product - would like the tension screw to be a little heaver. Next one I buy will be a larger size.
4,Good Medieval story,"Brian Stone has done a good job of translating this medieval story and has kept the alliterations (many of which are tongue twisters). Sir Gawain is challenged by a knight all in green who supposedly lives at the Green Chapel. The storyline has some twists to it and proves to be a satire on medieval romances. The Green Knight, the mysterious challenger to Sir Gawain, tries to test Sir Gawain in all possible ways; even throughout Gawain's journey to the Green Chapel. Surprising ending to the unaware reader. The end notes and essays are especially helpful in analyzing the story and understanding all the details of the poet. It's a good read if you're looking for a fun medieval story."
1,The Author believes,This author believes this to be a true ghost haunting without trying to resolve or find answers and not one bit of real creditable proof. This book was very hard to believe and heavy on the drama and felt like a woman who needs to fulfill her life and wants to by attention. This book was a waste of money and time.
1,Truth be told!,"In this book, Denice Jones makes it clear that she's not just kidding. She really wants us to believe in his ""ghosts"". At what cost? Sure, she makes lots of money selling us this, but what about all of her victims? People desperate for some sort of answers, and they get a charlatan who gives them a half-decent explanation. Save your money, or at least throw it away in a more meaningful way."
1,Where is the truth in true story?,"There are amazingly few actual events in this story . Those that are told, are drawn out to excrutiating lengths. It seemed to me that the author was just trying to take up space going over insignificant details ad nauseum."
1,Not worth reading,I Found this book very difficult to read and got bored by the story. It seems like a mixture of fact and fiction with most of it hard to believe. I never got to the ending. Skip this book!
2,Hard to Believe,When I started reading this book I was disappointed because I did not care for the writing style. It seemed very basic and amature. But I kept reading because I was curious and must admit that the story kept me interested. I tried to keep an open mind throughout and thought that maybe it could have been possible that these things really happened to this family. The part that blew it for me was towards the end when it just became too unbelievable. I wont say when as I dont want to give away the story for those who wish to read this. All in all I am disappointed because I find it so hard to believe.
1,Try Again,I started this book with excitement and anticipation. ... I was extremely disappointed. The entire style of this book is really lacking. The truth is missing and I didn't find it scary but great humor the author would think people would believe this. Nice try but it doesn't cut it.
1,A true disgrace,"I am a true believer in the supernatural and do not need a book for that need. The problem with this book is it states true story and there is not a possible way this is true. The author tests you by saying this and would make great fiction if that was stated, or was written like a book not a bunch of mumble."
3,Just couldn't buy it,"I've been interested in the paranormal for many years, but about halfway through this book I could no longer believe it was true.I didn't feel the family's reactions were believable. I simply cannot fathom loving parents making the kind of decisions they made. For example - would you ever leave your children in their bedrooms alone after experiencing everything they had??? Would you invite a sickly relative to stay over when the author already said they rarely had anyone in the house even to visit for a few hours.When it got to the part at the end,(in the cemetary) I decided this book was definately fiction.Just my opinion."
2,Horrible Writing,"I felt this story was true, some was made up for the story. I don't think the author could of written this as fiction without living it. The problem was the author's writing. Drifted, terrible grammar, alot of typo errors, these all lost my interest."
1,Disappointing to say the least,"This entire book is humor to what people do go through. The authors style really needs to be examined and the entire story is fictional. The ending, you want to skip the book and not even get there it is a disgrace."
1,Unbelievable!,This book is so poorly written I cannot believe it was printed. Nothing about this story has proof it was true. Maybe this woman was on Unsolved Mysteries but that was to push sales of this trash. I don't believe in trying to score money by using a child. The ending was incredibly stupid and so was the thinking anybody would believe this story.
1,Unbelievable,"I have read many ""true account"" books on hauntings, this book just seems unbelievable. It seems more made up than any I have ever read. Parts of it seem like it's been taken from movies like - ""poltergeit"", ""Amityville"", etc... It's just too hard to believe it's true and that Michael would continue playing or even sleeping in his room after experiencing some of the alleged things that went on in there. Or even that the parents would want him in that room. If the book is true... I do believe that it has been overly exagerated. I am disappointed in it."
3,Do you people even realize what you are writing?,"I have personally known the family for seven years now. I realize that people are hatefull unkind creatures, but the book IS based on real life events. They weren't fabricated for the publishing house. And god forbid anything like this should happen to you or your family? You'd better hope someone like Denice is around to help. Michael and D, love you! Lucy"
3,Not the best,"It takes too long to take a picture with this camera. It really does drain the battery life really fast! The video feature is not impressive at all, it has not sound. The quality of the video is what you would expect from a webcam during the time that this camera came out.Overall, it's not that horrible, it does take pictures and the quality is not bad at all. This is a good camera for taking pictures just not quick ones."
2,too slow,"it takes too long to take a shot, it's very frustrating when you're trying to capture a moment."
2,Too little too late,"It came later than advertised and missed the wedding. Also the cameras are only 15 exposure, so a little pricey compared to others."
4,love breaks and re-blooms for Bloom,"I love this DVD so much in the 1st episode: a Princess named Diaspro fights Bloom and then Bloom finds out Brandon and Sky switched identities, then in the 2nd episode Bloom goes to earth and the witches steal her Dragonfire power, then in the 3rd episode The witches seek revenge on Cloudtower and Alfea fights the army of Decay, and in the next 2 episodes the winx club goes two Sparx for the Dragonfire but end up having to fight a Yeti an army of ice crabs,and a great blizzard but all ends fine when Bloom and Stella make up with Sky and Brandon. This DVD is filled with fast action and romance!"
3,Cool mask. Small.,"The item shipped fast. Good quality, but very small. More fitted for a child, or a teenager. My kids love playing with it."
5,big Lou. what else is there to say.,"This movie is pretty stupid, but to see big lou at his best alone is worth watching it. its good motivation in the gym."
3,Double Feature DVD but no other extras,"DVD Hercules & Hercules II stars include Lou Ferrigno, & Sybil DanningHercules 1 is best out of the two films, sure both movies have plenty of cheese but the first film has less cheese then the second doesDVD seems to have a decent picture quality & plays nicely in a Blu-ray player as stated before this is a Double feature disk so of course you'll be able to watch both films if you like, note there are no extra feature's that's a bummer but if you like this version of Hercules it's a good deal for the price & you do get two movies for price of oneLast fun ramblesDon't take this film too seriously it's not a big box office film but it's still a fun movie to just chill & watch, I first saw this movie as a kid & I remember giggling a lot, but you know what it's not so bad hahaha it's still entertaining & worth buying."
4,Classic Lou,"If you are fan, a real fan, of Lou, then this is for you. If you saw this 22 years ago, it might bring back memories. This movie, in no way, challenges movies of today or even that time frame. Graphically it is horrible, the acting is sub par and the story just doesnt match up to most Hercules stories. But, I grew up with the Hulk, and seeing Lou as Hercules only makes sense. He is the only Herc that has the body to fit the bill. The first film, is basically the 7 trials of Hercules. The story moves along quickly, from one test to the next. The second film, Herc searches for Zeus's thunderbolts, oddly enough, Zeus knows where they are the whole time. Its mostly action, with fight sequences lasting only a few moments, consisting of Lou throwing right hands, and sometimes a boulder. Again, dont expect much visually from this film. Its simply a classic, for the fans of a generation long since passed."
1,What?,"I have no idea what went wrong. The cast seems like a dream: Lou Ferrigno certainly fits the bill (and he CAN act) but is terrible here, William Berger (star of numerous Italian Westerns) is given little to do but stroke his beard and Sybill Danning only redeems herself by the amount of flesh she has on display. The music is great, but is greater than the film it's playing for. The whole thing seems to be taking itself far to seriously for what it is.I know something like this could work as camp fun, but it just seems dead.And the second film isn't even worth talking about."
3,If you grew up watching it,"See I grew up watching cheap and cheezy movies like this one so I appreciate it differently. For the most part its a good movie in the sense that it shows some of the old greek gods such as Zeus, Posiedon, Athena and so on and so on. I like the greek mythology, so if u do too then this is an adventurous movie for you to watch. Its also casting Lou Ferigno, who to me is pretty good at playing hercules and taking on the treacherous villains that await him. Sorry I was supposed to keep this short, anyway overall the movie is a classic and a adventurous one for an 80's movie so I'd have to give it a 3 star rating."
2,In all fairness it was a different time.,"The era was different and I have to admit the movie probably was actually somewhat neat back then. Be prepared girls are scantly dressed and so are some of the men. The acting is pretty awful, this movie was just not really that great. Ferrigno definitely gives Arnold a run for his money though, Ferrigno was in his prime when they shot this and he is freaking ripped as hell."
5,Chessey but good,You have to like these older films that had big budgets at the time they were made and now they are chessey. Just goes to show you that once top line turns bottom shelf after time.
1,It put me to sleep,This book was horrible. It showed just how sexist the bible really is. Most women were treated badly and I deifnately hated the description of the perfect woman. It was also very boring and moved at a slow pace. STAY AWAY from this book.
5,The Quest is Over!!!!!!!,"If you what to read the most exciting book of all time get American Pie, it's obsiqious!!! Reinhart is a real life Indiana Jones!!! I was on the edge of my seat with this page turner!!! Reinhart if you read this what about a book about sicilian meat lovers pie?? That would be a hell of a read. I'd like to get a stack of those of perfect pies that would be the grazzle of the millenium!!!! Cheers to Peter aka ""Supreme"" Reinhart the greatest writer of all time!!!!! I give this book a full 8 slices!!!"
2,Waste of money!,"This book should have been a pamphlet. There are only three dough recipe's. The sauce section is worthless. Go buy the sauce at the store. Most of it is about the authors travels in Italy, Boring!"
2,Not horible but not what I expected,"The narrative was OK but he spent FAR too much time covering ""Sushi Pizza"" and ""California Pizza"" while completely ignoring Sicilian Pizza. He also spent too much time talking about cheese steaks. I also do not agree that any crust with stuff on it is pizza. I haven't tried the recipes yet but I hope they're better than the rest of the book.Since I travel a lot I was really hoping to find a couple of great pizza places around the country to try out. This book did not provide that."
4,Top Doughg!,"It's really MY 'pizza prejudice' at work here. This guy (author Peter Reinhart) is the top dog when it comes to all things dough! The first part of the book is a quick look at many of the 'famous' pizza places throughout Italy and the U.S. and how these pies compare. It really makes a pizza lover want to go check out some of these places. I found this quite entertaining and informative. I'm also very interested in the recipes for different pizza doughs and toppings because I built a backyard pizza oven and I could never get enough information on all things pizza! If you love either going out for (real) pizza or making it at home, you have to appreciate his quest for the real thing and the recipes that follow. If calling Dominos (sorry Dominos) or some other huge corporation for a delivery is your idea of pizza, don't waste your time with this book, you've already missed the point!"
1,Not what I expected.,"I purchased this book with the expectation of refining my pizza dough recipe. I hoped to learn the effects of each ingredient on the end product. I understood the first half of the book was a travel journal but I expected the second half to be more instructional. In all, I found it a waste of money. I learned more from ""The Bread Bakers Apprentice"" then I did from this book."
5,Everything You Ever Wanted to Know!,"...is right here in this book. A world tour of pizza and allit's styles. His personal journey and recipes of all the stylesof doughs, sauces and complete pizzas he talked about in thefirst half. As a note to the person that complained about theragged edges of the book. I contacted the publisher and that'sthe way the book is published. It's ragged edged on purpose.Doesn't bother me at all. The book is fantastic!!"
5,One for the Library,As with most people I have a fairly extensive cook book library. This is a very interesting read as well as a reference for creating the perfect Pizza Dough!! Many of the cookbooks I have are just that. A group of recipes with little background and/or those that are targeted at selling particular ingredients or brands. This on the other hand provides a lot of background into why certain things work the way they do. It's a great reference which I would highly recommend if you want to experiment in making a better pizza. We did and love the results!
5,Must have for Pizza Lovers,Even though I have been making my own pizzas for years I was just not satisfied with the crust. Thick or thin it just was not where I wanted it to be. This book clarified many question and solved several long standing problems. For both the beginner and the experienced pizza chef. I highly recommend for anyone interested in homemade pizza.
4,Really enjoyed it,The first part of the book is Reinhart's quest for a true delicious pizza recipe. He goesto Italy and throughout the US to accomplish this. The second part is the recipes. I really likethe way he put this together. If your a pizza lover like I am don't hesitate to buy this book.
4,Hits the spot,"I have been making pizzas for twenty years, always searching for improvements. Having no formal training in dough preparation, this book seemed to be the answer. Peter's writing is easy to read, with interesting experiences in Italy matched with excellent dough recipes and his take on the pizzas he and his fellow hunters experienced.Highly recommended."
2,Returned within a week,"I wasn't thrilled with this since much of the book is dedicated to the author's travels and adventures in different parts of the world. Maybe that necessary to some, but I was looking for pizza recipes, more than a travel guide. I returned it for a refund and I continue to search for the perfect pizza dough."
4,Great Book,"I think the other reviews cover this book really well, therefore I won't do a full write up. I did enjoy the book, but started falling asleep right after the Chicago Pizza section... in my opinion the book got boring real fast with the same tone and story for every place that he went. The recipes are great and the book in a whole I give a four star and would recommend."
5,Grilled Pizza Dough,"This book should be an enjoyable read for any ""foodie"" who loves pizza. I bought it for one reason, and that was for the recipe for grilled pizza dough. I would happily purchase it again for the exact same reason. Simply put, the recipe made the best grilled pizza I have EVER had!"
5,Excellent instructional tape,"I was thoroughly impressed by what this well produced tape, and its creators had to offer. The material on the tape was educational, very easy to understand and follow, and over all a very relaxing and easy routine to work into my daily regimen of wellness exercises.After one months time I did notice a change in skin texture and tone, and after two months I continue to be pleased with the results. It's a wonderful way to start the day!Customer service has been excellent as well. I am very pleased with the whole experience, and highly recommend this tape."
3,Not too mad enough about Mad Amos to matter...,"The stories, though cute, could have had a bit more humor. I thought they had a sort of dull sheen to the characters, more fuzzy in concept than what would really satisfy the reader. The Dean should take a lesson from A.C. Doyle on how he described the private dick, Sherlock Holmes. Amos should be given a more sharply delineated character, especialy in a short story omnibus like this one. I thought F.P. Wilson's short stories had more versatility (The Barrens and Others) than Dean; and Joe Lansdale's tales can kick Dean's characters and humor flat in a New York second."
3,Nice maps,"This book lives up to its description as an ""atlas""; it is nicely illustrated and most of the maps are very informative. As a description of the crusades it is somewhat less effective; the organization of the chapters is a little hard to follow, and there are a number of factual errors. When you look at the list of the author's other works, you realize that this book is just one of a ""stable"" of other historical atlases."
1,OK for those who have programming knowledge,"I think the book lacks in-depth syntax explanations. I finished the book not knowing how to approach a custom script, and felt it could have concentrated more on the syntax end."
1,"Not the usual ""Teach Yourself ..."" simplicity","I have, up to now, been very satisfied with the ""Teach Yourself ... in 24 Hours"" series of books. They are normally very well written and easy to follow, with lots of working examples and on-line support.This book, however, I found to be very vague and wishy-washy. The author's approach to teaching JavaScript is rather haphazzard and confusing. He tends to skim through the basics, never consolidating important beginning theories and as a result, the newcommer to JavaScript gets left behind, shaking his or her head. There are plenty of exercises to work through, but don't expect to find the answers anywhere if you get stuck. This book was NOT a good introduction to JavaScript and newbies will get horribly lost by about chapter 4.If youre looking for a SUPERB introduction to JavaScript, rather invest in Danny Goodman's JavaScript Bible - it's definitely worth the expense!"
1,Not Worth Buying!!,"I purchased this book because I bought Sam's Teach Yourself HTML in 24 Hours and that book was excellent from beginning to end and very easy to learn so I thought I would give this a try. I was terribly wrong. I am a total beginner and within the 4th hour I was lost. This book was not set up the same as Sam's HTML 24 Hour book. He tells how to write javascript but does not give you examples of how it should appear. He also tells you about things like applets, scroling messages, etc.. and dosen't give you examples of how to really write them, but then at the end of the hour he tells you've learned them. I was really lost when he talked about returning a value? He just doesn't give enough explantion. Overall a poorly written book and dosen't fully explain what the author is telling you and doesn't give you enough examples of how things should look appear after he give you examples of how to write them. This book is definetly not for the beginner like it says."
2,Running into trouble,"I'm trying to learn JavaScript, and have found this book to be difficult to use. Dividing the subject matter into easy-to-handle ""bites"" might work well if more detail was given in each chapter. As it is, I feel like I'm missing a lot. If the script doesn't work, I don't understand why not and where to fix the problem. It also doesn't cover IE/Netscape differences very well. For beginners, I recommend looking for something different."
2,It wasn't what I expected,"From an avid fan of another book, Sam's Teach yourself HTML in 24 hours, this book was a real disappointment. The book started off well w/ plenty of examples and easy to understand for the beginner, but the rest wasn't what I expected. Towards the middle of the book, he rarely gives any examples. He brings up topics of what you can do, but doesn't show how the code looks or shows any examples of what the results looks like. This makes the book hard to understand. I would not recommend this book."
1,Not enough example. Not worth for your money!,"This book has not enough example. It will give you some idea about JavaScript but you won't gain much out of it. I suggest the O'Reilly book, JavaScript: The Definitive Guide. That book is much better than this one. If you really want to learn JavaScript,don't buy this book. But,if you want to know what JavaScript is,this one should do it."
4,"Easy to follow, thorough, great examples.","Sam's ""Teach Yourself..."" series are clear, concise and effective. Michael Moncur's book is of no exception. As a student in an undergraduate Java course, this book was the perfect companion to my college text. In some cases, Java concepts were explained better in Moncur's book than in my course. Regardless of your experience, as long as you know HTML, you'll benefit from this book. You'll learn many of the most popular uses for JavaScript and unlike many of the other beginner's books for computing, you'll learn concepts - so that you can write your own scripts. Too many books poorly explain the topic, and serve no purpose other than to list examples that you can copy. Michael Moncur's book and others in the Sam's series are so effective that you don't even need to be in front of your PC to learn!"
2,Teach you in 24 hours?....No,"As a Novice developer who had an idea, and wanted to use JavaScript to get it done, I needed just what this book said it would do. Help me teach myself JavaScript in 24 hours. Sadly, after my 24 1-hour ""lessons"", I still couldn't get the job done. I did howerer get a basic knowledge of how the javascript language works, and a small concept of how to apply it. I think that what the average reader would gain from this book, can also be gained from the first few chapters of a more comprehensive text covering Javascript. Now I can go and buy one of those more comprehensive books. I could have gotten the same basic knowledge that this book gave me from and On-line users guide For Free."
2,"Very few examples, very basic","This book does not teach you Javascript. What this book does is gives you an overview of what JavaScript can do, without teaching you how to do it. The few examples given are basic and only touch of a few subjects. I would not recommend this book."
1,example code not working,When I test the code. I found it is not working properly. gernerating error messages. I don't know what to do. I need to contact with author about this issue
4,"Not the best, but pretty good","I'm a professional web developer, who knows HTML like the back of my hand, but not much JavaScript, until, that is I picked up this book.It starts with the basics, and works up from there, unlike many of the other reviewers, I had no problems getting my scripts to work and many of the applications made can be used on my sites (with a few word changes).Sure, there were and are a few things a still find confusing, but overall, if you keep the book next to you as a refrence guide, its a great investment.There are a few gramatical errors, and there could be more examples, and it would be great to get into more depth and explain how this code works sometimes, but I think its a great book."
5,Great book and great price for beginners,"Although not the most detailed, this book I felt did its job. It gave me a solid foundation in the basics of JavaScript and in a very short time. I recommend supplementing this book with a more advanced JavaScript book like O'Reilly's ""JavaScript: The Definitive Guide""."
3,An okay book for beginners to programming.,"I come from a strong VB/VBScript background and wanted to find a book that would go over the basics of Javascript quickly. I found the first 8 ""hours"" to be a bit of a waste. The book did not even mention objects until hour nine. I went through the first third of the book in about three hours. I'm now shopping for a better reference book.However, if you have little or no programming experience this might be a good choice. I have not yet found any errors (although I'm sure at least one exists) and the book is overall well organized. The only issue that might be a problem would be a lack of code samples.Also, if you don't know any HTML that could also be a problem. The book doesn't go into that at all."
1,I am my own grandma,"I liked the book until I read it. I would have liked it more if I had bought the english version amen..........I think. Surcharge?................ Whats going on where am I......................... Oh, in my study"
1,Dear God! What's happened to Lynn?,"This book made me wonder if Ms. Grabhorn has taken to the drink again.I could go on and on about how sad this book made me feel for the author, but I'll cut my comments short and just say I hope the author makes a full recovery."
1,Tottaly doesnt meet my expectation,"I have a big fans of Lynn Grabhorn since i've read her first book Excuse Me Your Life is Waiting.i love how she has flew her mind toward the readers, and cascade down it into a few initial step by step and ready to practice pointers.i love every detail she'd embrace and encourage us to sink down into our deepest feeling and turn negative into positiveness.And when i came across to grab this book (Dear God what's happening to us) those image above still running through my mind. i thought this book was the answer om my neverending question, and i was just went wrong!!!this book is about some of sort doom spiritual journey of Lynn which i dont even know at all what did she bring us for?well this is just my thought :)"
1,Save your money,"This book is in sharp contrast to her first book, ""Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting"". Much of it reads like the ramblings of someone with some type of schizophrenic disorder.There are no entities or energies 'out there' manipulating and controlling us, unless we choose to believe that and give our power away to it."
1,Dear God! What's Happening to Us,"I was very disappointed in the book. ""Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting"" was excellent so I couldn't wait for the new book. It is depressing & so far out there. It's hard to believe that the same woman wrote this after her incredible earlier work.I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,This book is bad and sad ...,"I was so excited that Lynn Grabhorn wrote another book until I read this. She goes on for 180 pages on telling us how the universe was created, good vs. evil -- or Abe (God) vs Lucifer and how Lucifer can get you. Lynn rambled on, not overly clearly. She has seven affirmation statements that will set you free. I think she should have put the seven affirmation statements on her website, let everyone know them and say them, and thereby be free of evil.Also the way that they advertised this book before it came out -- all hype on her saying something so new and different - maybe to Lynn it was, but I've heard this before.I stongly do not recommend this book. I am so dissappointed.I loved Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting but I hate Dear God! What's Happening to us?"
1,What happened to Lynn,"I remember reading Lynn's book ""Excuse Me Your Life is Waiting"" and it came at a turning point in my life and I inhaled it like a drowning man inhales air. Having said that I can only shake my head in sadness for whatever must have happened to Lynn before she passed on. She kept saying in ""Dear God! What's Happening to Us"", that it sounded crazy and thats the ONE statement in that whole sad book that I agree wholeheartedly with. I have no idea what happened to Lynn that took her off in what was obviously some sort of delusionment that flew in the face of all that she had written previously, but its very sad. If you have ever read any of her previous work, please spare yourself the time and money and leave this sad tome on the shelf and remember Lynn when she obviously had all her faculties and was lucid"
1,"Thank you, Lynn","By the time I read the first few chapters of Dear God it occurred to me that Lynn chooses to believe in two powers. It is karmic law she writes of. If not for this book, I would not have been awakened to the Truth that lies within me. Thank you, Lynn for the warning sign your book set off inside of me that forced me to decide if I really wanted to travel that path with you. My answer was an emphatic and resounding ""NO"". There is but one Power. No karmic law has any power unless one chooses to give it power. I choose not to and am grateful for this book."
3,I think she's a little nuts...,"While I found what she said, a little on the side of insane, she presented it in an interesting and entertaining fasion that I gave it 3 stars as opposed to one. It was a good book if you believed what she wrote, I found a few contridictions, and several things confused me, but overall, she's a good writer."
1,"Don't read, don't buy","I had been inspired by Ms. Grabhorn's earlier works, so bought this sight unseen. Something bad has happened to Ms. Grabhorn's brain. Do not buy this book. Do not read this book, even at the library--mania/insanity is contagious. I don't know if Ms. Grabhorn has gone back to drinking, but there is the phenomenon of ""wet brain"" or the ""dry drunk"". Also, there's the problem of co-morbidity: you can suffer from two or more problems, such as alcoholism AND manic-depression.I don't know anything about Hampton Roads publishing (is it Ms. Grabhorn's own house?) but they should have known better than to publish this dangerous nonsense."
1,My God ! What happened to Lynn ???,"I love the playbook. I find it very useful. A great reminder of everything that rings true. But you'll have to excuse my honest opinion on the Dear God...I can't help but wonder if Lynn lost her marbles altogether on that one. She must have because she is obviously not playing anymore. Oh well, I guess it just goes on showing...never confuse the messenger with the message or is it the other way around ! Anyway, we all are (Lynn included) still working...excuse me...playing on perfecting all this positive stuff approach. And at times we just take a detour...;-)I gave the book one star because of its catchy title, not because of its content obviously ~"
1,Absolute trash,"Imagine your 79 year old neighbor invites you for tea and pours her world view over you, no stops at all.This book is stupid, crazy and quite a bit retarded, on top of being a lousy copy of much better material written long before she got on the best-seller bandwagon. I rarely read books that I want to toss right away, this is one of them.the message that we are being controlled by negative higher dimensional beings has a lot of credit in my opinion, but this book does NOTHING to convince me or anyone with half a brain of that point of view.avoid at all costs."
1,"A very bad follow-up to ""Excuse me your life is waiting""","I was looking forward to reading this book, as I mostly enjoyed Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting, and am now very disappointed. The book is a collection ramblings and rantings, a strange mish-mash of religious pondering. As another reviewer said: I'm left wondering if Ms. Grabhorn even believed the information in her first book Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting. I strongly recommend that you save your money."
1,"Oh God, What Happened to This Author","I was stunned after reading this book. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry for the author. I liked her first books, but this one seemed like such a reach for me. I have enough problems with faith in God & this book didn't help. I did say her doctrines at the end of the book to be on the safe side though. To each his own, I guess."
3,is this happening to us,Well if what is in this book turns out to be true then its one of the greatest books ever written!!!!If not it is still inspiring
3,The Incas,Mosre technical than I was lead to believe. Looks likes someone's thesis. But it has the background I need for my scrapbook.
1,More than a little deceptive,"System is absolutely the wrong word to use, as this is only one speaker. Buyer beware!!"
5,"Just like her sister, Dorathy, a great ""read""","It has alot of history pertaining to this little area. A interesting tale. It also included her sister, who herself was a very good historian and author. This book tells in great detail, the history of a way of life in Florida. I am proud to call her ""family"""
4,Was the Crimean War a mistake?,"A fictionalized biography of Lord Aberdeen, who was Prime Minister of Great Britain at the time of the Crimean War. The Crimean War was the Iraq of the mid-nineteenth century. Lord Aberdeen got Britain into it, then bungled it and got fired in the middle of it. That's the usual version of events. The author thinks Aberdeen got a rough deal.It might be of interest to those who are already interested in British history of the first half of the nineteenth century. Mount seems to assume that the reader does already know a lot about it. He drags in a lot of celebrities as peripheral characters, which is ok if you've heard of the celebrities. For example he introduces a character who turns out to be Lord Palmerston, which might be intriguing if you know who Palmerston was.One of the best parts is an appendix where he explains the history. There's a lot of historical parallels to be explored, and maybe a straightforward biography would have made a better book."
3,Regular beer cans slip through.,"When I first got this I was excited, then I realized a regular 12oz beer bottle would not find snuggly inside, the same with cans."
5,Great can and beer cozy!,"I became fast friends with this beer cozy over the holidays! The handle is a little small (I've got average-sized guy hands), but I was happy to find out that some of the fatter beer bottles (like Sierra Nevada) will work work, too!"
4,Exactly what I wanted,Exactly the product I was looking for. Good quality for purpose and like the handle. The product is good quality and the shipment was QUICK!
3,typical soft core,"This is a typical soft core porn flic. Lots of simulated sex between attractive ""actors"". Some of the actor/actresses are ok and other's are amteurish. The plot is weak, the writing sophmoric.If you are looking for something with a well written, believable story that is well acted, don't buy this. If you are looking for something with lots of female nudity and simulated sex (female/male and girl/girl) and don't care about plot, writing or acting, this will fill that bill."
4,WORTH LOOKING AT...,"Voyeur Beach is the unrated version of Watchful Eye, containg more scenes than the ""R"" rated movie. Sure it's still softcore, but Voyeur Beach does have some full frontal nudity, and if you like Renee Rea (Fast Lane to Vegas/Malibu) she's one of the sexy women in this film. The movie is basically about this house on the beach where couples are being watched as they have sex. There's some suspense at the end but not enough to make it a major thriller. So if you're into movies like Digital Sex, or any of those ""Cinemax-type"" late night movies you may want this one."
3,Not Quite,"This American version of ""Voyeur Beach"" is missing several crucial minutes of footage. I ended up ordering the original movie, in PAL format."
1,a waste,"this movie was a waste of time , money, and just plain stupid the whole thing made no sense and i can't understand why people think it is ok to charge so much money for crap. yes crap is what this movie is and was and i hate it do you understand i hate it and the people who created it. this is so sad and diabolical and i get sick to my stomanh and nostrils just thinking about this stupid piece of trash. goodbye"
2,Voyer Beach,"Voyeur Beach is a softcore movie as any common softcore. The best thing about this movie is its title, as ""Voyeur"" gives thrills associated with a masterpiece of Tinto Brass. You can disagree with me. Because the title might be the worst thing as it delivers the disappointment due to high expectation.Anyway if you just want to watch great bodies this movie suits you well. Did I say the more you expect the more you would be disappointed."
1,Never Received this item!!!,I never received this item from the seller Jensbrown. I contacted the seller 3 times and never heard from the seller. I've placed a complaint and I am waiting to hear that my credit card will be credited for the full price.I in turn ordered the book from the publishing company on Sunday had the book on Tuesday.I probably not order from Amazon again.
2,"Dated, modernism, serious omissions","Because this book was written before the 1996 Olympics and organized around the major architects (and firms) practicing in Atlanta, there are conspicuous omissions. Unless the structure you wish to research has a brand name architect (you know, John Portman, John Burgee, Philip Johnson, etc...), it won't be in here. And if it's a church outside the city center, even if it had a brand name architect, it won't be in here either. There's a heavy modernist slant to the book, and an inexplicable lack of coverage of Atlanta's important ecclesiastical and neoclassical structures, particularly outside the city center. Architectural historians and classicists will be disappointed, which is surprising considering that Elizabeth Dowling, classicist extraordinaire, was the senior consultant for the book. Perhaps a new edition can improve on these problems."
4,great quality bus,very well made / solid built bus. easy to mount on surfaces with the two mounting holes. has plenty of mounting spots.
2,A Letdown,"I suppose there was no way Green Carnation could match the brilliance of ""Light of Day,Day of Darkness,"" but one would at least hope for more than mediocrity. These songs don't grab me at all. LoD,DoD's single hour-long track was riveting listening from beginning to end; BiD seems like it's been going an hour by the time the third song starts. If you liked the frenzied creativity of LoD,DoD, don't buy this disc -- spend your money on Without Face's ""Astronomicon,"" Devil Doll's ""Dies Irae"" or The Gathering's ""How to Measure a Planet""."
2,"Yes, it is that bad","Not being familiar with their first cd, I am writing this as a standalone review. And to be honest, the cd just doesn't go anywhere. Writings on the Wall has the potential to be a really good song, but much like the rest of the cd, the song kind of dies. It just doesn't go anywhere. Boy in the Attic is the same way, as are most of the songs. The songs just die, but not before the listener has to hear the whole thing. This cd is really not that different than hundreds of other ""new metal"" cds out there. It can pass as a Godsmack cd or any other band you choose to insert as one of the cutting edge (whatever) bands out there right now that are mired in mediocrity and uninventiveness. It's nothing new, and even worse, it's nothing that good. Frankly, it's a pretty boring cd without one really good song on it."
3,Great Dark Rock,"Don't let the cover fool you.This is actually a well crafted dark rock album whichg keeps Metal in mind.The vocalist's voice takes a listen or two to get used to but it will definitely grow on you.You will soon find yourself jamming to this one after a couple of well mixed drinks.Definitely for fans of In The Woods, Katatonia, Tiamat(GAIA), & Agalloch."
3,"Great Kung Fu, Poor(est) Transfer","I watch a lot of kung fu movies and have come to expect that the DVD transfer of such films is usually less than perfect, but this one went above and beyond the call of duty to be one the worst DVD transfers of a kung fu film I have ever seen. During the first 20 minutes the film is almost unwatchable as everything takes place in what appears to be heavily-foliaged terrain, its very hard to tell because everything is washed out green with almost no detail visible, even the actors appear to be green when seen in the distance. Also one can see this was transfered from a VHS tape or similar format as it appears that the tracking was being adjusted constantly for the first sequences of the film. The only thing that saves it from getting 1 star is that it has some very good scenes of Mantis Kung Fu, when they're actually visible of course. Here's to hoping they find a better print of the movie someday."
2,A step below mediocre in every way.,"It doesn't have enough happening in terms of action, story, humor, character development, or style. Not sure who the target audience is for this anime, but it obviously missed. It's not terrible, it's just not good. Of all my friends that watch all different genres I just can't think of a single person to recommend this to. Ok, I got it! If you want something on in the background that doesn't require attention or tempt distraction, and you don't like recordings of soothing ocean sounds; this anime could be for you."
1,not as good as expected,"the art and storyline are not as good as expected. the art reminds me of 1980's anime. it's not very detailed. the character of ichimatsu is actually viewed as the villiage idiot. when i think of a gun wielding samurai who mowes down everything in his path and then hates himself for it later, i think of someone who would never take any $#%& from anyone. not so. the episodes where very shot and not very clear on what the heck was going on. these bad guys start appearing and we have no idea where they came from of what their motivation is. it comes of like violence for the sake of hero kill all bad guys violence. save your money ."
1,couldnt even get through the first two episodes.,"being a advid anime watcher, I'm always looking for new series to get hooked on. this is not one of them. its dull, boring and doesnt even try. if ya looking for hardcore action with epic fight scenes, look elsewhere. this series is just too lame to comprehend."
3,Simple but effective,"Not a wine buff but decided to buy one as I had seen it used in a restaurant. It's easy to use but as others have said it can't be used with a bottle - I went out and bought a carafe. It's also easy to clean. It filters and aerates the wine, speeding up the progress of allowing the wine to breathe. No regrets."
4,"Pretty nice, but not perfect.","This funnel is pretty nice. The holes at the bottom cause the wine to cascade gently down the sides of a decanter. The finish is nice, and it fits well into my decanter. It will not fit into a bottle of wine, for those who like to decant and then re-bottle. My only gripe is that it is made by joining two pieces together--the upper dome-shaped part and the neck. A small pool of wine collects where these 2 pieces are joined. After decanting the wine, one needs to be careful with the funnel or a small amount of wine will spill."
2,Filter Holes too large,"Product has potential but the filter holes are too large, letting some sediment get through. This really shouldn't be that hard."
5,It makes a big difference,"Up until now, I thought this type of thing was for the wine snobs, of which I am not. Even for those cheap $7 bottles of wine, this really does make a big difference in the taste of the wine. I highly recommend it."
2,2 steps back for Neurodisc,"I finally thought Neurodisc was moving in the right direction, having a big name like Scott Stubbs mix Trance Vertigo to give the label solid club credibility. I have never heard of Suzy Solar, who does a fine job on this mix. The tracks just don't stand out over anything else at the moment. The beats will get you dancing though!!"
2,Palm Treo Krusell Leather Case with Belt Clip Review,"The actual case itself is great, but my only problem is with the clip. The clip itself just fell apart, and I can only attribute it to the design. Two extremely tiny plastic gaurds can't hold up an entire phone for too long. Now, I'm stuck carrying my phone around with my hand (already misplaced it once from it falling out of my pocket). To recap, the case is great!!!, the clip...won't last long.."
5,This cover does the job!,"When I first put the Krusell Case on the Treo, it was difficult to stretch on. Now it comes off and on with ease. I like the clear plastic that protects the complete front and side keys on the phone. The keys are rounded on top and causes the sylus or fingers to slip. The plastic protector prevents this. I dropped my Treo shortly after applying the leather cover (not recommended). This case did the job. My Treo was not damaged. The way the advertisement reads the Belt Clip comes with the case. Not so! I had to order the straight clip and the swivel clip to use with the case. I do recommend this product."
2,too soft for a cowboy?,"Good quality, he sings well, but too syruppy and monotonous in my opinion to give the real sensibility I was expecting. Sorry."
4,Looking to read soon,"I have yet to purchase this book but by reading the reviews here on amazon and hearing about it on a few radio broadcasts I gave it a 4 star rating because I like the constructive information I picked up thus far. From all the information I have gathered I can say that has pushed me to purchase this book in the near future. I feel this book will help me learn more about interracial relationships and help me understand the area of people activity better (sex), I want to thank Ms Tate for constructing this book and I am even more excited to read it."
1,Anti-Miscegenation Garbage,"This is anti-miscegenationist racial purity garbage at it's best. If that's what you like reading, then you'll love this book."
1,Racist crap! I wish zero stars was an option.,"Just reading the excerpt below, you get the general idea of what this book is about: Hating white men simply based on their skin color. The author seems to miss the fact that men of all races and colors can be abusive, just as men of all races and colors can be kind, supportive and loving. My white boyfriend does not consider me ""property"", nor does he treat me in a disrespectful way. I'd like to know how many white men the author has even spoken to, one-on-one. She seems to be a very bitter and angry woman who has taken a very real problem (racism in America) and just added fuel to the fire.The book was also poorly written. Do yourself a favor and take a writing class."
4,Stories 1 and 3 * * * Stories 2 and 4 * * * * *,"1. Lynn Kurland-* * * This story might have been better if it were more developed. It was okay, not boring but no pizazz at all. William of Artane was a pretty good hero and could have shined in a full length story. Julianna Nelson was adorable.2. Patricia Potter- * * * * * This was a very charming, subtle story with great sentimental characters. Duncan, so handsome, and Lynet, a lovely and loyal person, were sweet together. It was a joy reading this one!3. Deborah Simmons- * * * For the most part this story was quite boring, but it did pick up a bit - most notably with Guenivere's tearful confession of love to Beren.4. Glynnis Campbell- * * * * * This was the other great story. Ryance was a great hero, very handsome and vulnerable in a charming sort of way, and Hilaire was very lovely. My only problem with this story was how to pronounce the names."
1,Don't bother,This e-book is very poorly written. The stories were not well developed and there were sections of text quite obviously missing.
1,This book was a waste of money,"The cover and title caught my eye....but from front to back cover, it was a waste of my money and time. The stories were ridiculous. I felt cheated. I put the book in our office breakroom figuring someone would try it and take it....it's been there for a month. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one with good taste."
4,Very good,"I love almost any book by Lynn Kurland this one was no exception. All 4 books were fun,clean, silly and horribly romantic. All these characters are from the McLeod clan and a reading order for her books can be found on her websight."
3,So-So,"This collection is worth reading solely for Lynn Kurland's story and it isn't one of her best. However, it could have been if they had been smart enough to have her write it as a full length novel. The other stories were boring as hell. I do not understand why the publisher persists in having Lynn write short stories. They are NOT her forte. She is too good an author to waste like that."
3,"1 great story, 3 mediocre ones...","I'd give the first 3 tales in this collection 2 stars each - they just didn't hold my interest despite being well-written - and the last one, Glynnis Campbell's ""The Siege,"" 5 stars. I got this book from the library first and then bought it so I could re-read Ms. Campbell's piece whenever I want. The plot is very original, the dialogue both witty and tender and the romance quite believable. Beg or borrow this book from someone if you can, to see if you think the others are worth the $."
3,Cuaderno review,"The service and delivery was fine. But, I bought this book thinking it would be more similar to the newer edition of Avanzando and it was not. I would not suggest getting this book if you are looking to replace the newer edition for cheaper, the publishing company changed it a lot."
1,Avanzando Gramatica Workbook Spanish Edition,"I bought a used Avanzando Gramatica Workbook Spanish edition and can't understand why they are sold if they are already written in them. ""Used"" should be simplified further for the buyers sake. The buyer needs to know before it's bought and decide whether they want to buy them this way. The one I bought had every single page written in, and was all in ink. I had no way of erasing it. I was very unhappy with my purchase."
4,Helpful,The exercises don't follow the book exactly and the Table of Contents is less than helpful in finding the section you're looking for. A few of the answers in the back are just wrong. Other than that it is a very helpful companion for the book.
4,Cuaderno de ejercicios para Avanzando,good condition and definitely liked my choice of shipping. definitely a speedy delivery and the condition was exactly how the dealer explained it
5,Loved it!!!!,"Very nice and worth every penny. Works perfect in our new 1/2 bathroom. It is true to color as we put all brushed nickle fixtures. I would definitely recommend this, very sleek."
4,"A bit long yes, but great","True, the book is LONG, and printed on THIN pages. True, it includes just about everyone and everything rather than a selection of a few of the so-called ""greatest"" African-American writers. That is the beauty of it though, it is precisely what it claims to be: an anthology.You won't be able to read it in a day or two. But it is a reference tool for your family. Read it slowly and carefully, and decide for yourself who is ""worth including"" and who isn't.I think this book is great, but if the number of pages scares you, maybe it isn't the book for you."
5,This is a MUST for all chant or Robert Gass fans!,"Awakening is one of the best CD's I have ever purchased!!! Containing chants that cross both cultures and religions Gass demonstrates his artistic talent!This CD has 8 different chants leading up to 61:38 minutes of peace and serenity!!! The included informational CD Insert is useful for words, historical and culural information.Voices of Glen Velez, Steve Gorn, Margot Krimmel, and Omar Faruk Tekbilek add to enchantment.Highly highly recommended! Order this CD......I am sure that you play it again and again!"
5,Very Good Plein Air Painting Primer,This book is simple and straight forward. I really simplifies the whole process of this technique. The author even specifically tells which palette colors to use! Love this book!
3,okay movie,"The item is great and works as described. I would purchase this again if asked. Dont worry, Buy with confidence!"
1,derivative and wful,"probably one of the worst sequels i've ever seen, and that includes the straight to video american pie movies. it was nice to have all the original characters back but without a storyline beyond 'remember the time' story, it simply amounts to 2 hours i'll never get back."
1,Sequels are never good,Wasn't as good as I hoped. Commercials made it sous a lot funnier. Didn't deliver and some funny scenes were just korny.
3,yet another okay sequel,rarely are sequels as good as the original and this is no different.. some funny moments.. was good to see the whole cast on this one.. wouldn't ever buy the dvd but the rental was certainly worth it if you were a fan of the original.
4,A classic piece of pie,"For those that love the American Pie series this is a fun trip down memory lane with homage to the raunchy, dirty, uncomfortable jokes that made us love the series in the first place. 4 stars because admittedly the plot and story could be a liiiitle bit stronger...ok a lot stronger.... But let's be honest, we're not watching it much for the plot. In summary, the gangs all back doing what they do best...with many of the classic jokes that long time fans foun d hilarious (and still do) and a nice mix of new comedy as well. Mav"
4,Hilarious,"If you liked the other ones, you will like this one too. Very funny, in that American pie kind of way."
2,Wish this Pie had a scoop of Ice Cream,"The first 2 American Pie movies were hilarious. They brought an age old joke to the films. But with this sequel we see the same old story line from most of those ""Reunion"" movies, where old characters reunite in older age.This film had its good moments, but not worth multiple watches and I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for a funny night."
4,A Great Movie to Watch on a Weekend!,Really liked the movie! Very funny and entertaining. Would definitely watch it again. I recommend it to others as well that like the raunchy type of comedies.
3,American Reunion,"Felt like this movie could have been a little more funnuier. It was funny, but doesn't really compare to American Pie."
2,eh,"Good, if you like raunchy comedies, but not really my cuppa tea. Tons of sex and nudity that isn't necessary... but it's also the whole plot so there would be no plot development without it. Don't like those kinds of movies? Don't watch, you won't enjoy."
2,Not even worth watching,You really have to be desperate to watch this movie same plot as before and nothing new was added.. I endured eleven minutes and bailed out.
4,Lots of fun.......,"If you like the first couple of American Pie movies and enjoyed them, well you rein for a surprise cause this one is also very good and fun to watch. We get tosee all our favorite characters and more. Thumbs up to Eugene Levy's contributionto this film also."
2,funny but crude,"It's American pie again. Funny, but also corny. I'm glad I watched it, but I didn't have much else to do at the time."
2,Good Movie...Not So Good Playback,"This was a good movie. I laughed almost the whole way through. The only problem I had was the playback. The movie would buffer every 10 minutes and I had to restart it on numerous occasions.As I said, good movie...not so good playback."
2,An OK movie...juvenile funny,"An OK movie like all the movies of the series with a lot of juvenile, funny moments. Cannot watch it with your kids. Not appropriate for young kids.Movie is made of predictable bad jokes by adults who never grew up, during a high school reunion. But then what would you expect from this bunch? Not as good as the first two, much more dirty (in language and inuendos) than the first two movies. Really degrading to young women.Movie shows what really happens to people who don't get a real life and keep going to these totally unnecessary high school reunions. Get a life and put high school behind you. Stop thinking about the past and look into the future. Move on!Two stars for the juvenile jokes that are really funny...if your are into these kind of jokes."
2,"Fair, at best","This movie reaffirms that the only worthwhile character in the franchise is Stifler. Everyone else just drags this movie down. Unfunny, poorly acted, & boring."
1,Just dumb,Some people just never grow up and this was a perfect example was hoping it would have at least 1 redeeming quality but Nope not at all
2,Forgettable Movie,"It has been a month and I don't remember one thing about this film outside of the fact that it failed in every aspect where AP and AP 2 succeeded. It was nice to see that many of the actors have not honed their acting skills over the years. And, Stiffler and Jim's Dad simply can't carry these films. I'd pass on this class reunion."
4,funny but not best American Pie movie,"American Reunion was funny, but wasn't the best of the American Pie movies. They started making the most ridiculous movies and this one actually makes sense. Good ending too."
4,Big fan of the entire American Pie Series,"ALL of the American Pie movies have been great, as long as you are a fan of satirical comedy. And, this one,American Reunion, was no exception!"
4,GREAT BAND CAMP MOVIE,"American Reunion was good (un)clean fun. It's particularly good to watch in high-definition - a must for the nudity scenes.I recommend that couples watch this movie if they've seen the rest of the American Pie sequels. It'll make you frisky for ideas on what to do after the movie.It was nice to see most of the original cast and the memory lane pictures that rolled during the credits. I had forgotten about the Shermanator, and finally, Stiffler gets revenge. If you haven't seen the first (American Pie) you should get it and the other movies to include with American Reunion for an American Marathon. A band camp somewhere is doing just that."
3,Not bad,"But not as good as the original. It was interesting to see where they are now, but the story was pretty slow going."
2,american Reunion,american reunion i like it. I would watch it again. i though it was fun. I would buy it. I don't now what more i can say about it.
2,Not what we expected,"My husband and I love the first three movies and we own them all on DVD and Blu-ray. We were disappointed that this last one was not nearly as good, and we were sorry that we bought it. They could've done without the babysitter part of the story line: it was too predictable and carried on for too long."
3,The pie has been stretched a bit thin,"This installment of the American Pie series falls short of the mark set by the original three films. It has the usual hijinxs that we've come to expect from the characters, but it falls short on substance and meaning."
5,"Good to have you back, guys!","This movie is more fun and more deep that you'd think. In fun, it it almost living up to the first movie which can hardly be topped, of course. But it adds some serious aspects to the notorious sequence of low-level jokes which has been typical for the American Pie series. And this actually makes the movie a really good one, telling a surprising story about friendship and change."
4,"Honestly, what's the difference between Theatrical & 'Unrated'? I seriously don't see any!","Well, it's nice to get all the Blu + DVD + digital copy + UV version in a single package for dirt cheap.BUT... Honestly, where's the difference between the unrated & theatrical releases? My friend and I saw the theatrical release & couldn't pick out any scene that was added or noticeably extended or more 'raunchy' in the so-called 'unrated' cut of the film. What am I missing?? Or rather what is the so-called 'unrated' cut missing? AM I blind??Anyway, the film isn't bad. If you liked the first 3 films, I'm sure you'll like this film. It's largely more-of-the-same. The characters have all moved well beyond HS, got jobs, got married, got bored and want to relive a little high school mayhem. Which they do. As always, many scenes ""played for awkward,"" lots of sexual and potty humor. Some of it pretty damned funny, if you're into that sort of thing."
3,Ehhh,"The first one was great, the second was alright, the third was bad and this was just alright. Nothing special"
2,American Reunion,"Overall, like most sequels, this film failed to live up to its previous movies. American Pie 1 is still the best and most original of the series. The stars and humor have lost their original effect and it is just a rehash of overused situations. Not worth the time it took to watch."
4,Rates with 1 & 3 i didnt like 2.,They tried to have enough humor & female nudity compared with the first one there are quite a few moments to worthy more viewings & enough time had passed to come up with a good script unlike no.2.
3,It is what it is - don't expect more,"It is what it is - don't expect more A continuation of the previous mildly entertaining nonsense, but worth spending $4"
5,Loved it!,"A great laugh, loved it! I enjoyed all the movies in this series and this was no exception -well worth watching!!"
3,american reunion,"Very predictable, most of the was descent. There were a couple really funny scenes. The highschool reunion night was really dumb."
5,Hilarious,I have long been a fan of the American Pie series and this was just another great one. No complaints.
4,Not bad... but act is starting to get tired,"of course with any american pie franchise movie... there are some good one liners but the story is getting soooo tired and really has reached the end of the road. the stars are out of college, almost going through midlife crisis... (imagine stiffler getting an IROC and growing his hair long).i enjoyed some of the great one liners (hence 4 stars) but it isn't anything that gets me so pumped where i put it in the same class as American pie 1 or 2"
3,American Reunion,It was a good movie. Nice to see the progression of the characters and how their lives had changed. Funny.
1,wrong movie,The american reunion dvd that i bought was suppose the be unrated. The one i got is a rental dvd and it wont let me play the unrated vertion. i'm not very happy about that.
2,A let down from previous movies,"I expected at this to atleast follow the HANGOVER receipe...same movie, same jokes, a few smaller laughs. Very disappointed in the approach was different....and not in a good way...they tried to change the movie which is respectable, but they changed it away from its roots....Big let down."
1,This movie was terrible,The worst out of all of them. Not funny.....just dirty.If you like that kind of movie than this is the movie for you.My opinion is only mine so don't go off what I say.
5,awesome,It was the main man movie. It was a perfect ending to the series i wish it would show kevin getting married and oz striker.
2,Pretty bad,"Predictable rehashed jokes. I'm a fan of the series but this was just bad. I think I might have laughed once, maybe."
5,Surprisingly just as good as I remember,I loved all the original movies but was afraid this one would be raunchy or out of touch since it is an older series. It was surprisingly funny and tied in to the previous movies perfectly. I was very pleased. I almost died laughing at a few of the scenes especially the kitchen pan fiasco. Great movie for a ton of laughs!
4,Has some good one liners,"If you like the humor from the original movies you will probably like it, if the first three didn't make you laugh this probably wont either. I got a good laugh out of it."
5,ridiculously funny,To me this movie was flat out hilarious. I laughed more in this movie than I have in a long time. Far exceeded my expectations.
5,Hilarious,"I've seen most of the American Pie movies and have been entertained through them all, butI thought this was Great! Young parents can definitely relate and old friends will laugh together. Highly recommend"
5,Really funny,"This movie is really funny, script follows the previous movies and you'll get good laughs.I will definitely watch again."
1,"DVD ran fine, but the MOVIE was terrible......",This movie stinks.......simply gross. The first three in the series had 'some' heart to them..this last encarnation was just gross.
1,"okay, this one sucked, too.","No more of the American series for me, they've degenerated...not that the first two were of a high caliber, but they made me laugh, at least.""American Wedding"" had some funny parts, but it and Reunion drag terribly, don't they? And its the usual, dull presentations of lessons learned, lord...if you are compelled to do this, at least make it interesting and as unique as possible, the movie ""Hall Pass"" suffered from the same problem, and its this kind of predictability along with a lack of humor that kills these movies.I had to abandon this movie before it ended, so I would highly recommend avoiding it."
1,Mediocre Comedy,Expected more than I got from this American Pie sequel. I think the characters have had their time and I hope this is that last time at trying. So long American Pie...I'll remember when you were still funny.
1,Completely boring,"Boring movie. It's all about how each of the main characters are dealing with crappy marriages and how they almost cheat on their wives. Of course it is all happy endings here folks with over-the-top moments where they ""expect"" you to laugh. LAME."
1,american reunion,I bought this to watch on my kindle fire and the entire movie would not stop buffering. After about 10 minutes I stopped trying to. It was awful.
2,Not as good as the earlier ones,"The earlier ones in the series were funny and original, this brings back the old characters but doesn't really add much and ends up being crude without being as funny. If you're a die hard fan of the series, you may enjoy it."
4,Good Sequel,"For those that watched the original American Pie years ago, this to me was the true sequel to the original. It nailed the feeling of the original movie and the characters were all played pretty well. There was definitely a feeling of nostalgia watching the movie and their age is pretty close to my own which made me more aware of the guys being older with their own lives and problems now. There were a few one liners that didn't go over well and a couple of slow parts, but overall this was a good movie. I look forward to continued reunions as the cast ages. Maybe one day we will see American Children, and see how the current group of guys deals with teenagers of their own."
2,not the best,I was disapointed in this last installment of the american pie franchise.. It just wasn't that funny.. Good think stifler was in it or else I would have given it 0 stars
3,Pretty good flick with some good comedy,It was nice to see most of the original cast return for this film. I enjoyed the movie but the first American Pie was better. There were some pretty funny parts in the movie and I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys the American Pie series.
3,It's ok,"I wasn't crazy about the movie, but my husband loved it. He laughed the entire time. Needed to complete my collection."
3,Hey its American Pie,If you know the series you know what to expect. Turn your brain off for 90 minutes and enjoy. It is mindless crude humor but like I said it is part of the American Pie series so what do you expect.
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in this movie. I expected more comedy. Just not as funny not that they are older now.
1,No chegou,Minha compra ainda no chegou e nem consigo rastreá-la!O vendedor também no entra em contato para me comunicar o caminho de minha compra.Será que fui enganada?
1,Not really worth it,I ordered this game after reading Mr.Bunny Guide to ActiveX. That was a great one! But this game doesn't seem to be useful or at least ironic. Disappointed.
4,Fun game for 2,"We bought this game at a used book store just to spend some credit we had. We ended up liking this game quite a lot. There are a lot of different strategies to win and it's not that hard once you learn the rules and play once. We've probably played at least 10 times in the two weeks that we have been playing it so far. We wish there were some expansions, but sadly it did not seem to catch on very much. Oh well."
5,Love This Group,I just wanted to say that I really enjoy this CD. I've loved this group since they first came on the scene back in the 80s. This CD was so affordable. I recently lost my job and I was still able to make this purchase and the quality is very good. Thank you so much.Ren
5,ITS ALL GOOD,"all, of DE BARGE, MUSIC IS GOOD TO ME. EVEN MUSIC FROM BOBBY AND TOMMY DE BARGE IN THE GROUP SWITCH.MY MAIN CONCERN IS, HOW CAN I PURCHASE MUSIC OF EL HIS SOLO ALBUMS, AND HOW CAN I GET A VIDEO COPY OF THE PERFORMANCE, I BELIEVE, THE 20 TH REUION OF THE DE BARGE PERFORMING IN THE CARIBBEAN HOSTED BY SINBAG.E-MAIN"
2,20th Century Masters Best of Debarge,I ordered this cd The Best of Debarge on 11/03/2010 I received the cd on 12/2/2010. You do the math. I normally buy from sellers that are close to me so I receive pretty quickly. I will def. Keep this seller in mind so to ensure this was my last purchase.
2,behind the wheel spanish 3,"discs 3, 4, and 5 did not work. I think if they did I might have liked the whole package...but given the price and fact that I wanted all the discs to work...(crazy idea...I know) ..I sent it back to amazon. they refunded my money promptly, but the product is kinda just ok if you ask me. I have been using pimsleur 3a and 3b and I love them...not so keen on 2a and b."
4,Brings back memories!,"I was looking for some good, old German ""Schlager"", and came up on this CD.Having grown up in Germany with parents that loved Schlager, this CD sure brings back some great memories.Most songs are famous, but ""Aber Bitte Mit Sahne"" is a classic!Love it, love it, love it!A must if you grew up in the 1980s in Germany, and miss the ""good, ole' days""..."
1,Only the portion of tank with the filter is getting filtered!,"With no holes for water to flow in and out, only the side of the tank with the filter in it is being filtered. RIDICULOUS! Not to mention betta's need 5 gals or more live happily and this divider suggests you put two or even THREE in one 2.5 gal tank!?! And that anyone not on the filter side sit in their own waste?! CRUEL! These fish come from rice paddies that, for the majority of the year, can be thousands of gallons! And they are naturally aerated. The myth they like tiny places is absolutely ridiculous."
3,Good content but bad publishing,"I found this book to be a useful, if not very in-depth, overview of servlets. I liked the inclusion of the section on servlet engines, as well as some of the author's own utility classes. I agree somewhat with the first review regarding formatting of the book itself. The worst aspect of this book is the numerous typos, particularly in the source code. If you plan to implement any of the examples, be prepared to do a lot of debugging. For example, at one point in a sample program the author calls a class that he has written himself using an incorrect class name. Typos like these make sample code useless for anything but the most schematic overview. Manning press would be well served by examining O'Reilly publications for this kind or rigor."
1,"This book doesn't deserve ""one star""","There are plenty of good servlet books. Don't waste your time and effort and money. Too bad the review section doesn't have a rank lower than a ""one star"". This book is much worse any other book I read that get a ""one star""."
4,A great start to servlets,"The negative reviews on this book smack of a political witch hunt against the author. This is an excellent starter book for servlets that contains realistic examples that work. Are there some negatives, sure - there are in all books. As a whole, this book is a useful reference and a good read. I have and would recommend it again to folks starting out with Servlets."
1,garbage,"I'm new to servlet programming, but sufficiently prepared to realize that this is a very sloppy written book. I also suspect that the author doesn't have the insight and posseses only superficial take on the subject. Don't buy it !"
1,Unremarkable book with example code that doesn't work.,This is the author's second pass at a book on Java Servlets ( his first was perhaps the worst book ever inflicted upon the market ). This iteration is rife with code that doesn't work so why bother?
1,Don't buy this book,I don't understand why some of the readers found this book useful. It's the worst book on java servlets. Buy J.Hunter's book instead
2,It is the worst servlet book,"I was so curious when I read this review page. So I decided to buy this book just to see how bad it is. Truly, it's the worst one. I recommmend other servlet books, rather than this one."
1,This book does not cover JSDK 2.1 as it claims.,"The book says it ""covers"" JSDK 2.1 but ""covers"" only JSDK 2.0. I have Jason Hunter' Java Servlet Programming which I find far better in explaining the concepts than this book. The examples given in this book contain plenty of mistakes and the reader needs to do a LOT OF DEBUGGING to make them work. I don't recommend this book to any serious Servlet developer."
2,Worst of Servlet books,"I was curious about this book when I read this review page, so I decided to get one just to see how bad it is. And it's bad really. All I can say is: it's the worst one. The author says so much about unimportant topics, while he doesn't concentrate on other more important things much. I recommend Java Servlet Programming by Jason Hunter and Inside Serlvets by Dustin Callaway."
5,Saw her live in Dublin,"I only went to see Erin because my sister was in town from the States and Erin and she both live in Virginia. ""Why not...something to do anyway."" Erin was totally brilliant. A truly enjoyable and amazing talent. Both my sister and I were compelled to buy here CD after the show."
3,Disapointed,Having read other more insightful biographies of James Dean I thought this biography to be very dull and tedious.
1,All these 7 DISKS ARE 2 channels SACD.,"All these 7 DISKS ARE 2 channels SACD - NOT ""The absolute best 5.1 SACD mix I've ever heard in a Rock format. ..and it's Creedence!"""
2,Translator,"I'm very disappointed with this translator device. First ol all the backlight is to weak, for instance it is practically impossible to see the screen when you are in a darker room. Second, the search mode is too confusing, for example it is difficult to search a single word if it is not included into the phrasebook. On the other hand, the device has a helpful list of phrases which suits for differents situations and also the pronunciation of the sentences are perfect. So, as a general view the device is too limited if you are looking for a portable translator to use during the day."
5,"I WAS THERE, LOVED IT AND LOVE IT STILL!","I was at this performance, so I'm severely prejudiced. I had not heard Marshall in person before and never Bruscantini in person, which was a great treat for me. Muti and Battle I knew as fan who went backstage at their performances and talked to them, got their autographs, if that counts as 'knowing them'....Araiza and Morris I heard many times at the Met, especially Morris from the time he started at the Met...like 'homecoming' that night in Salzburg was. Wonderful memory that I can relive with this dvd. So, yes, my 5 stars are biased!"
2,To what purpose?,"In several of the scenes in Act Two, the conductor Muti, larger than life, is superimposed upon the stage action, in some cases completely blocking out the singers. I found this disconcerting, particularly distracting as the opera is ending. None of the reviewers have mentioned this; if I had known, I should never have purchased this DVD version of the opera. I have never seen such disrespect for the performers, nor such disregard for viewers like me who want to watch the performance, not the conductor."
3,Disappointing,"I found the acting stilted. All four main singers seem to be singing to the audience and the camera instead of to each other, which creates a constant feeling that the singers are not involved with one another as characters. I dont agree that the voices match well with one another, finding that even the 'gentle breeze' trio seems out of sync--- a difficult thing to do! The staging is generally very good, especially for those who prefer their Mozart without modern accessories. Overall, not bad, but nothing to rave about."
1,Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.,"I have listened to over 600 different opera recordings in my lifetime on video and if I had to choose a video that had the worst sound quality and the worst balance of sound recording between voices and orchestra, this would be the one. This, like many opera dvds, was not a recording produced exclusively for dvd, but rather, a dvd recording re-recorded onto vhs with added menus and special effects. Muti is an excellent conductor and the emotion sparkles in this production but my ears were left straining to hear the notes of Mozart's beautiful opera. Avoid this recording like the plague and don't say that I didn't warn you. If you want a good recording of Cosi Fan Tutti to listen to, (I'm still looking for a good video recording) buy Georg Solti's recording with Michele Pertusi singing bass. You'll love it, I promise!"
2,"Good performance, poor video quality","Muti's performance is acceptably""Mozartian""- and the singers do justice to the roles. The production is what one might call ""opera house standard.""However, the video rendition is atrocious - perhaps the translation from European to American video standards was ""too much"" - the images are ""jumpy"" and erratic- it's distracting in the extreme. Turn off the monitor and listen to the performance."
5,Muti's Cosi,"It's important to realize what we have here. A very sophisticated performance musically, full of vitality, beautiful orchestral playing, and six superb soloists in roles that suit them well. Riccardo Muti is one of the leading Mozart conductors of the day, and his perfectionist and stylish approach, serving the composer totally, is an absolute delight. The production is stylistic, and pretty to look at. The live performance has an electricity which is captivating. 10 out of 10 !"
5,it's on it's on it's on!,"Go ahead and try to fit The High Strung into this garage thing after you hear this record. We have not heard song writing this good since The Pixies. And that includes all these new bands. Just check out the bass line on ""It's On"" and you'll realize that these guys are already in the books...whether we all know it yet or not."
3,Worked ok for a while,"This item worked ok, i had it turned on 24/7 for several months. I believe mine was purchased from ebay though. It pushed out some very nice scented air with the included aroma beads. Very loud on the Hi setting, but that can be expected. Very quiet on the Low setting. It does a decent job, but don't expect too much out of this little thing.After a few months, the unit developed a loud whistling sound... it would go away if i shut it off for a little while. Then the whistle started to stay, and it never went away. About a month or so after that, i didn't hear the sound anymore... it turns out the unit was dead.If i ever buy some of those long skinny screw drivers, i'll open it up and take a look inside. None of my screw drivers can fit in the system right now.Overall, it was a decent item. I wouldn't recommend it if you need something that's going to be on 24/7."
5,resealed fishtank,"Bought this to reseal an old 30 gallon tank. it wasn't leaking but turtles I had started to rip up the original seal. I washed tank out, ripped out as much of the old seal as possible, and after a good drying, resealed with this sealant.It's been more than a month and so far so good. Now with the left over of the sealant I plan on adding some mods like internal overflow box to one of my other tanks. I've got some acrylic glass pieces lying around so figure why not now that I have the sealant. Just a note you probably want to use this somewhere well ventilated since it gives off a strong vinegar like smell as part of the curing / drying process."
2,I see Venice from the description.....,"There is an operatic romance feel to the title ""Death in Venice"" written by Thomas Mann in 1912. Since I been to Venice, I really appreciate the descriptive details in the early 19th century; I too was on ""the familiar ride across the lagoon, past San Marco, up the Grand Canal"". They are just as beautifully described in the story as I remember seeing them with my own eyes. The stream consciousness of the main character, Gustav Aschenbach's trip to Venice, is truly a laborious art piece. I could only absorb a couple of pages per reading session. Luckily, this translated version by Stanley Appelbaum published by Dover publication is only 62 pages.I would recommend this book to readers who are familiar with Greek mythology and Homer since there are many of these references in the story. I am not sure I truly got the symbolism and its relevance to the story.Check out my other book review[...]"
3,Didn't much like it,"I understand the obsession with beauty and the fact that he never even touched his object of desire. What I didn't like about it was that I couldn't identify with the character and had a hard time getting into his head. Maybe when it was written it was groundbreaking, but this type of work has been done since and been done better."
4,Something beautiful,"I enjoyed this book. Angst and infatuation set in a time of infectious disease. Just perfect for me, really.Beautifully written, of course."
5,One of the classics..,"This is one of the most beautiful books the 20th century has yet produced. There i s some action in the book, but that is rarely what readers remember afterwards. Somehow, what lingers in the memory is the melancholy and almost dreamy atmosphere that dominates each page. Personally, when I saw Visconti's excellent film version I found I had forgotten the greater part of the actual action. However; to give potential readers an idea of what to expect I suppose I should tell you that the central character is the greatly respected, but ageing professor Von Achenbach, who at the turn of the century leaves his native Germany for a holiday in Venice. Once installed in a comfortable hotel he notices among the guests an almost unaturally beautiful Polish boy, Tadzio. Von Aschenbach is slowly but surely obsessed, and we come to realize that the boy represents the Angel of Death.."
1,Death in Venice,I was told it was used but in good condition. It is in terrible condition. Every page is underlined. Many pages are more than half underlined making it very difficult to read.
4,Works well,"This product has worked well. We have not had any problems with it. You probably don't want to put more than 2 T of loose tea in it though. Even at 2 T, the tea didn't have a whole lot of room."
1,What a waste,"This looked like such a great little Christmas gift to give to my husband who is gaining interest in loose teas. Fortunately for me, I was curious to see how it looked because ""teaball"" tells me ""round object,"" and the picture looked like it's of half the teaball... Anyway, I tried to open the teaball, and it wouldn't even move!!!! I'm glad I didn't give a defective gift. You may want to consider a different product."
3,Functional but too big,"I brew Twinings English Breakfast, which tends to have pretty small leaves and find this teaball lets a good bit of tiny leaves through, but they all seem to do this. To combat that, I fill the cup or pot with water and then immerse the ball. That helps.That said, this particular ball is too darned big for any other than the huge mug. It does fit into my two favorite teapots, but only just. Make sure you have a wide opening on your pot, or you'll be wrestling it out. The title says it--LARGE stainless teaball!I had no problems opening this teaball."
4,Works just fine,"I bought this teaball in spite of the bad review it received from one customer. I'm not sorry I did. It is a nice large teaball and is great for pitchers of iced tea. I had no trouble with the mechanism and, in fact, was plesantly surprised at how well it worked. I concede, however, that if you have compromised dexterity due to arthritis this may not be a perfect choice."
1,Can't keep it closed :- (,"I really wanted this product to work. I love the simplicity of the design and I was planning on giving two of these as gifts. Sadly, as other reviewers have stated, the locking mechanism does not work properly. The two halves practically fall apart. The bumps/grooves are not pronounced enough to keep them attached.WMF really should try to correct this issue, because if the unit stayed shut, I'd easily give it 5 stars."
5,Incredible sound,"I use a pair of these speakers as the front speakers in my 7.1 media room. They sound incredible. They have a very clear, robust sound to them that sound great with music or movies.The front grill was broken on both my speakers when they arrived (obviously done during shipping). I contacted Polk, and they quickly sent me replacement grills that took 2 seconds to install even though the shippers were at fault."
4,"Great sound, great looks","Beautiful cabinets, almost perfect sound. Can't beat them for the money. To my ears, the midrange lacks just a smidgen of clarity compared to speakers that cost more than twice as much. Nothing I've heard in the price range comes close."
1,Pretty terrible,"I purchased these to replace a pair of Zipp valve extenders I was using on a set of 404s. I found that the Zipp extenders didn't allow the pump to attach securely, so topping off the tires was always a two person job. Reviews of the Topeaks (like the ones here) suggest that pumps will attach securely. Sadly, this turns out to not be the case, and I've tried it with a number of different pumps. And the valves, once the pump is attached, will release nearly as much air as your putting in. I understand that some people have no problems with this, but if I were in the market again, I'd just buy 80mm tubes (which I have since done). I recognize that that isn't an option for people running really deep rims."
1,Oh dear oh dear!,"I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to do so for this product.I have been through about 5 of these in the last few years, the latest pair went yesterday when I was about 5 miles from he nearest train station and i got a flat, bothe extenders failed and broke. I wonder if topeak will refund me the price of a new pair of cleats?It seems that the bit that attaches to the valve stem splits very easily.I'll be using 80mm valve tubes from now on."
2,"Mehh, does not really work, cheap plastic insides","The extender looks good on the outside, but the threading inside the extender is a plastic insert (too weak to hold a seal or hold on the bike over time) so if you Teflon tape and then try & really snug it down the treads will pop in the extender, thus making a bad seal and something that will likely fall off later. You want an extender with a machined thread, not a cheapo plastic insert."
2,Valve extender not a new valve,"was trying to replace the valve on my evos and thought this was a valve in itself. Why else would I buy this thing. It is heavy because it has a shaft the runs down the middle to engage the existing valve. for the extra weight gained over my zipp extenders I get the benefit of being able to let the air out easier. For me not a value. In fact it is already in the trash,"
2,Leaky,"Was not able to use this to inflate my tubes because it didn't seal properly.I'm not sure if my unit was defective or if it wasn't compatible with my tubes. Regardless, this product was a waste of $7 and is going in the trash."
3,A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW,"Having lived in Rwanda for four years during the peaceful days, I am always interested in any writings on this. I have read Bob Gribbin's book about the period after the genocide and found it full of substance and information. I find this book of interviews (double-spaced and in larger print) easy to read and interesting. I don't know how much the normal reader would glean of the mentality of the Rwandan people or their lives from this."
1,A great educational read.,"This book offers insight into the minds of the killers at the time of the genocide. Make no bones about it, they actively and willingly participated in the day to day activity of killing innocent families.It is probably better to do some research on the topic before reading this book, to get the most out of it. The book is well written and candid, my only criticism is it becomes a little repetitive at times.However getting convicted killers to talk for a book is a great coup, as most in Western Worlds are reticent to do so, or are not honest."
4,Machete Season: The Killers in Rwanda Speak,"If you want a different and eye opening perspective of the 1994 Rwandan genocide this book is a must read! This book gives gruesome, matter of fact details of the genocide from the killer's point of view. The Rwandan genocide was described, by one of the killers, as going beyond human imagination and it does. I had to stop reading it for a while before starting up again. The author uses other genocides to fill in the gaps of how and why. In my opinion the author does not try to gain sympathy for the killers and does a good job of illustrating how easily neighbors can abandon their humanity and turn into greedy, cold-hearten killers."
4,Less rugged but still very useful,"The hard, smooth plastic case on this updated LED type snake light seems less robust to me than the original. The texture of the old original was rougher; which might be better if your hands get slippery for one reason or another. But this new version obviously puts out more light than the old incandescent - and batteries will last much longer. So if you are not working in a harsh environment, the new model is probably best."
2,There are better choices for the money,"I am disappointed at how poorly the flexible joints are made. They are much too 'loose' of a design...meaning that it most often won't hold the position you place it in. If the configuration in which you position this unit is not perfectly balanced around its center of gravity, the 'head' (light) will either 'droop down' quickly, or the entire unit will tip over. And it's flexible joints are also too 'loose' to grab around a pole...it will just slide down. I bought a $6.85 3D battery/20 LED lantern from Amazon with a pivoting head, and it served me much better than this snake light. As for the problem reported by other reviewers about 'breakage' if the head was removed to be used as a flashlight, I didn't have that problem."
1,Too weak to maintain any required position,"No matter what position you try to pose the light in, it just falls flat as soon as you let go. There is no way to pose it in the position displayed in the ad or on the package. You can hang it around your neck, but that about all.."
1,Paid for it but never got it seller/Amazon doesn't care,"I ordered this item, saw the full itemized delivery of the item. It was delivered to someone on Nov 26th but that someone was not me! Tried to contact the seller and Amazon but to be honest neither seem to care that I paid for a product I never received. Will never order from this seller again. When you pay for something you at least expect it to be delivered to your address. Very angry, frustrated and flat out MAD. Really I rate my experience as a negative 100"
1,not as good as,The led light is not as good as a regular bulb. Way too much glare produced. Would not recommend it.
5,Snake Light,"This gift arrived just in time to help my son with a DIY project. He called me to tell me he couldn't believe how helpful it was. My husband and I have owned one since they first came out and there isn't enough room to list all we have done with it. Other style ""headlights"" are limited to the position of the user's body. The snake light is much more versitile and can literally stand on its own!"
2,snake light,"I was very pleased with this light in the begining: after a few weeks the beam would short out and it required shaking. needless to say, a waste of moneywould not recommend this light"
2,Very disappointed,I ordered 2 of these lights from Amazon to replace a first generation light. The first unit's 3 led light is a weak light. I tried 3 different sets of batteries and gave up. I tried the 2nd light and it is a litte better. My main regret is I waited too long to return. I found another light at Amazon by another company and it is what I wanted with the first order.
2,Not what I thought,"The ""snake"" neck of the light is not very tight. It does not stay in the position you put it nor can it hold the head of the light up very well which pretty much renders the ""snake"" feature useless. The alternative flashlight feature is nice though."
2,"Great Idea, Poor Execution",I needed a light I could put in different positions so that I could work with both hands and see in areas that are not easily accessible. Unfortunately this device does not fit the bill very well. It will only hold still in a few positions. In most positins it just tries to straighten out too much and either tips over or illuminates the floor. It's not a well designed product.
1,"Terrible, broken immediately.","The first time I tried to convert it to a flashlight the end broke off. So I tried the other end, snap, it broke as well. I inspected the inside once it was broken and it looks like where it's supposed to swivel apart it was glued at the factory, making it impossible to twist off. I superglued it back together but all in all it's a huge waste of money."
3,Liked original better,The original Black and Decker Snake Light was made a lot better than this one. but they no longer make the old one. This one is OK
1,Broke right out of the box,"Disclaimer is that I bought it at a Ross store but nowhere does it indicate that it is a factory second or anything like that and it is in completely identical packaging to the ones sold in the mainstream stores. I took it out of the package put the batteries in and had trouble getting the light to stay on but before I had a chance to address that issue I twisted the end off to see how it worked as a flashlight (w/out snake part) and the connector snapped off rendering it useless for either configuration. I might have dismissed this as a lemon but noticed another reviewer on here had the same experience. I am really bummed b/c this is exactly what I was looking for, I just wish it was made better. I am hoping to call black and decker to see what they will do for me but have not gotten around to it yet. Bummer. I will say that the light was very bright while it was on but the plastic isway too brittle for a connector that is intended to move!"
1,don't bother,"the movie is extremely boring, every scene is predictable - the Plot is predictable right from the Beginning and the outcome. Don't waste your time like I did."
4,Good,"This is really good!! i first saw this movie in the internet but a few days ago, i bought it. unfortunately, i couldnt find the DVD, but i bought the VHS"
1,0 STARS! AWFUL!,"Can S Club 7 act? NO. Is it pathetic? YES. I thought the TV shows were bad enough, but now a movie? Bubblegum pop icons making a movie isnt the best idea AT ALL."
1,This sucks!,"Stop giving bad excuses for films. I hate this rubbish so much I want to burn it.Whatever you do, DO NOT buy this pile of junk."
5,cool song,my place was such a cool song. since it has a nice romantic feel and i liked the part when nelly said the f word.
5,Wonderful songs!,"I don't buy CD's, but when I heard about this one advertised on tv, I just had to have it. I'm so glad Amazon had it available & that I got it. It's like having a CD that I would put together myself if I had the choice. I loved all the songs & each singer. It was very inspirational (though most of them are NOT religious-type songs like you'd think). I still really liked it a lot and my husband listened & liked it, too. His favorite song was the title song, ""Three wooden crosses"". A lot of songs for your money."
4,Three Wooden Crosses,"This CD is awesome. I purchased it after losing the one I had. I checked Amazon and they had it. Bought it used from Go Hastings. I got it earlier than I thought. The CD had one song on it that after halfway through quit, it went to the rest of thesongs and was fine. I called Go Hastings and they refunded my money and told me I didn't have to send it back. I will for sure use them again."
5,country dr,The quality of the CD is great and is all I hoped it would be. I have no complaints and appreciated the fast service I recieved. If you like inspirational songs this is the CD for you.
4,it was pretty good,it was o.k. specially if you like sailor mercury it also had a lot of pictures most sailor moon lover's have not seen
3,"It is good, but....","What this book doesn't have is information on Ami's parents. I've always wanted to know about how she grew up, ect. Sure, we know her mother is a doctor, but how many people know that her father is divorced, and is still living today as an artist? I was very dissapointed that this information wasn't included into the book."
2,a pretty random collection of essays,"The first thing you should realize about this book is that it is not a systematic introduction or explanation of Nozick - it is merely a collection of about 8 articles interpreting and criticizing fairly narrow areas of Nozick's thought.The introduction or first chatper (don't remember which) provides a pretty good five page summary of Nozick's Anarchy, State and Utopia but the rest of the book is pretty worthless, pretty much like the journal articles you might expect to find if you searched for Nozick articles on JSTOR or EbscoHost or another online journal program.If you can read the first chapter in a bookstore go for it, otherwise you are probably wasting your time and money."
1,The Gliding Flight is NOT Simple,"This book assumes that you are totally familiar with origami techniques. I am not. For example, the design for the All Purpose Delta Wing model starts by stating that you have to begin with a waterbomb base. There is a reference to flip animation on page 146 (per the Table of Contents) as to what a waterbomb base is. There is NO flip animation, only a picture in the left margin of page 146. Do NOT purchase this book if you are seeking a ""simple"" set of instructions for making paper airplanes."
5,Elegant origami & fun flying,"I was delightfully surprised by this book. The airplanes are great examples of origami, they look good and they fly! You'll discover some unique and dramatic looking airplanes here. The folds may be difficult if you're not familiar with origami, but there is an ingenious ""flip-page"" tutorial printed on the page edges that illustrate the tricky folds."
5,amazing airplanes!,"While some of the folds are origami difficult (there should be difficulty ratings for each plane), the planes really are impressive flyers! The book attempts to demonstrate the more difficult folds with flip-through style animations on the margin of the pages. My 5-year-old son thinks I'm the best paper airplane maker in the world!"
3,Hard to follow (cueing and exact positioning),"I'm not sure how I would rate this. On one hand, I definitely can feel my abs after using it. On the other hand (a) I feel like there is not enough description given on the exact positioning, making me wonder if I could injure myself or if I am targeting the muscle accurately (b) it is very hard to follow -- you have to watch the screen much of the time to see when she is changing position and to what position she is changing. And obviously you cannot be watching the screen all the time if you are supposed to be in plank position, looking down rather than craning your next to the tv screen. She needs to talk louder and more explicitly when transitioning to another position..."
2,"No Sir, I don't like it!","I bought this workout because of the rave reviews. Seeing it in various magazines also nudged me into buying this workout and putting it to the test.I could not bring myself to do this video more than three times. I just don't like Tracy's ""style"" and found the video very unenjoyable.The two stars are for the arm workout, which you will feel working immediately. After doing the video a few times, my arms definitely look better.As a former belly dancer, I understood the concept of ""standing abs"", but Tracy's moves are so spastic that someone who is a beginner could injure themselves.There is nothing in this video to give your inner thighs a workout at all. Your butt will feel the leg lifts, but I have shorter and more effective workouts (Core Fusion) that I enjoy more for that area.If you like wondering ""Am I doing it right?"" due to Tracy's lack of cuing, this is the workout for you!"
3,Tracy Anderson Mat Workout,Very good workout. A little more explanation for the movements would be helpful - I think you should be familiar with this type of workout to get the most out of it.
3,Good for experienced home fitness users,"Tracy has the most amazing body - so this is a very good incentive to do this work-out. However it is pretty advanced, hard work and not very well explained. If you are just starting out I believe this would make a frustrating choice. It needs clearer instruction, however if you want to feel you are moving along with Madonna then go ahead - as it does sometimes feel like we have slipped into a few of her moves."
3,Tracy Anderson Method Presents Mat Workout DVD,"DVD package arrived very fast. I think there are parts in the DVD that are missing, as it is always skipping. There is a part in the DVD where Tracy says that i will need 3 pound weights for the next excercise, but then it skips and she doesn't end up using them. Other than that the workout is great - i can really feel the muscles working in my legs, waist and arm areas."
2,"Tough mat workout, but instructor doesn't give any cues.","I have done alot of workout DVDs, and this one is definitely tough - especially the arm workout. However, as some of the other reviews mention, there are literally no cues or explanations of how to properly do the exercises. This makes it difficult to follow which ultimately reduces the effectiveness of the workout and is very frustrating.I also think it is unrealistic that in her interview she states ""she really doesn't want you doing anything else"" besides her mat and cardio workouts."
2,not sure,"Tracy is hard to follow. She doesn't talk much, so you need to watch her at all times. I don't like it. I am always little behind . It's interesting workout, but she is sort of dancing each move."
4,Better than the first DVD,It is worth buying this if you want to tone your legs and arms. And unlike the first (dancing) DVD by Tracy it doesn't require masses of space to do it in. You will only need a chair and some small hand weights. I find the workout rather unconventional but worth a go. I've only been doing it for a couple of weeks but i do feel it is making a difference especially to my legs which feel trimmer. I'm really going to stick with it for a few months because I do believe it will help me to shape up.
4,Fabulously fun fitness!,"This DVD is great, it really works your core accessory muscles in a way you don't normally target them in other workouts so a great compliment to a complete exercise regime. I especially like the abdominal workout at the end and after only 2 weeks have already got the beginnings of a super toned tum again! My only negative is there are very few teaching points or prompts between moves and so you do have to constantly watch the screen to know when Tracy has moved on to the next exercise. But that aside I highly recommend this DVD.I suffer with a spinal condition making exercise very difficult but this workout allows me to tone my body without back pain so anyone else who suffers should also be able to do this DVD with minimum discomfort."
1,what a disappointment!,"It took Tracy 8 years to put together the research for her ""Method"" and this is what she came up with?? I don't even know where to begin. It's not an instruction video, because she doesn't give any instruction! you have to watch her every second, but here's the trick: sometimes you can't see what she's doing, either because she's behind a chair or because she's in a contorted position on the ground with her legs behind her. Couldn't they have worked the cameras to show the exercises from more than one angle? This is a terrible video, and if I could return it, I would."
1,Terrible instructions,"The instructions are non-existent or unclear and for some of the moves Tracy does different reps for left and right sides, the sequence for left and right sides are also different. All in all confusing and although I was able to follow the sequence through familiarity, the inconsistent reps and sequence means I have switched to Brazil Butt Lift which gives clear instructions and far more effective."
3,Good Workout by Tracy is a Terrible Instructor,"This workout is challenging and I would have given it a higher review, but Tracy Anderson is a terrible instructor. She fails to explain what she is doing or how she is doing it and consistently switches moves without warning you ahead of time. If you are not a trained dancer, it is nearly impossible to follow some of the moves at times because she does not explain how to do them."
5,Worth Every Penny,I am a big fan of Tracy Anderson. This video is fantastic and has an amazing arm section. Buy this video with her post-pregnancy video (great ab section) and you will be set. Tracy is in incredible shape and I find her pleasurable to look at and very motivating. I would buy this video before purchasing her new design series. All you need is a chair and 1-3 pound hand weights. You will not be disappointed.
3,raviana videos are much better!,"hello!i ordered this dvd and couldn't wait to start doing it, but i was a little disappointed. maybe it's because i got used to doing the kundalini yoga dvds by raviana, where every movement is accompanied by a breathing technique...but to be honest i just tried to this video once, so maybe if you like and do it regularly you will get the results that are promised in the beginning..."
1,Never recieved!,The shipping solution this company uses is the worst ever. It is the cheapest way to ship and after almost a month I still have not received the DVD. The time to recieve the DVD advertised is way off the mark and I had to leave a forwarding order at my home on the East coast because the DVD never arrived and I had to leave and return to Houston. I am still waiting to get the DVD and ordered it on August 29th.
1,This is a joke,"Good lord this girl is rediculous. She stands in the same spot for 5-10 minutes doing one move, doesn't talk to the camera, etc. I used this dvd twice and couldn't deal with how annoyingly it's filmed."
1,Dangerous for you!,After working out with the video for a month my upper arm began to hurt terribly. I decided to give myself a break for a month and my arm is feeling much better. This video is not safe to exercise with!
2,What a JOKE!,"This is seriously the worst workout DVD ever made. I am so angry that I bought this!!! I would have given it only 1 star, but I'm sure there are women out there who having dance backgrounds and they might think this is a good DVD. I kept waiting for her workout to get better and it just didn't. If I could break it down for you: Tracy Anderson dances around in a basement fitness room (looking totally, utterly bored and trying very hard to look sexy & sultry). She gives you little to no tips on form, no motivation, nothing! You just hear the music and see her dancing around. Good luck trying to copy her moves in your living room. There are SO many other fitness DVD's out there that are better than this. To top it off, Gwyneth Paltrow speaks at the end, and talks about whoknowswhat. Then, Tracy tells you how she came up with all of this nonsensical garbage. GREAT! That will help me look so much better in a bathing suit!UGH! Terrible. What a WASTE of $30. Seriously, don't buy."
1,No info on the mat workout,"I have been trying to find out what type of workout this is. No info on it anywhere. I e-mailed Tracy via her website several times but no response. I think this is probably just hype since she trains the stars and have decided not to purchase it. Tracy, if you want to sell these workouts you need to supply some info. A clip of the workouts on your site would be great. I know these are not the same workouts you use for your upper crust clients but $30 for a DVD is alot to put out without knowing what your buying."
1,If you are a Christian - reconsider this tape because of blasphemy,"Tracy is charming and her exercises are great. It is terrific workout. However, if you treasure the name of Jesus Christ don't buy this tape. For some reason she felt it was necessary to put music with lyrics in the background of her exercise tape. The music says ""I am the Christ"" and it is not talking about Jesus Christ. It is disturbing and repulsive for someone like myself who treasures the name of Jesus Christ. I considered working out and turning the music down on just that song, (It is the first song on the tape). And then I thought, Why would a keep a tape in my house that insults my faith. I threw it in the trash. It seems that everywhere we turn Jesus name is used in vain and derision. The last place I expected to find that the case was on an exercise video I bought at Costco."
1,Dumbest video ever!,I am a fitness professional and have watched my share of fitness videos. This is the absolute worst video I have ever seen. She is just dancing with herself and throwing around little one pound weights. There is no way that Madonna is doing this workout. Very poorly produced and she is very unengaging and unenthusiastic. Big thumbs down.
2,Don't believe the hype,"I have heard so much hype over Tracy Anderson and her celebrity endorsements from Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow. Her video is blah and the excersises are just repeat excersises that we have been doing since the dark ages with mega-reps. It's weak and as a teacher, I don't find Tracy Anderson all that motivating to watch or work out to. She's just another skinny blond who does excersise."
3,Ehh....an okay workout,"I ordered this DVD to mix up my other routines (running, air climber, circuit training etc.).-She doesn't say much during the workouts so it gets VERY boring after doing it even twice for me.-There are no options to mix up the dvd chapters.-I do feel a burn during the arms portion from the constant movement.To be honest I'm not sure I see much ""results"" from doing this dvd. If I stuck to a VERY low caloric intake and only did this dvd 5x per week, I suppose I might see something. That's just the way my body responds to these types of workouts.This may be good for someone who has more of a dance/ballet background and enjoys this over interval or weight training.This one occasionally gets rotated into my other workouts, but I don't love it."
4,mat workout,"Tracy really makes you work, but it can get annoying after a while....I really think that her method works, at least it did on my body. She has a new dvd out and I think I will buy it beause her method in all about changing the exercise so you don't bulk.maria"
1,I wanted to like this,"This dvd is terrible. I had no idea what was going on. TA didn't count reps and when she did, she miscounted. I got sucked into the hype. I'm glad I sold mine."
2,Nice ideas with little instruction,"As a Pilates teacher I always look for new ideas and methods. I take classes and I watch videos. Tracy is not instructing for the average person in this video. I found myself constantly watching her to try and figure out what she was talking about. If she was actually cuing it would be simple to follow her. But all she is doing is moving around and pouting at the camera. Yes she has some great concepts and movements, but she is teaching by her instinct not by practical instructions. She is very quiet while moving without telling the audience how to stand, shift, or align themselves. Nothing. I can see how she would be fun in a room; live. But when a person needs details from a video, alone at home, this video is lacking on the basic essence on instruction."
2,Tracey Anderson's Method,This DVD is a great workout if you can get through it entirely more than once. The workout is about 1 hour and it is very hard to jump to a specific section that you may want to do. Most other dvds allow you to pick a chapter or section in case you do not want to do the entire workout. This was very frustrating. The music was good but mellow. I am going to give it another chance but Im afraid it might end up on a dusty shelf.
1,Waist of Time!,"Just got this dvd and was so dissapointed. I can't believe people actually buy this. Do you think your body will look like her when your done? You'd have to starve yourself along with doing the video. Talk about bad instruction! She's all over the place, it's like she making it up as she goes along and doesn't let you know when she's switching moves etc. I really don't think that she even targets the muscles she's aiming for. I've done plenty of workouts and I can feel when I'm working that muscle. Her arm exercises just kill my shoulder, that's all, even though she says it will get rid of the flab underarm (triceps). She not in my opinion any sort of fitness person to follow she should be modeling with all the poses she does throughout her video. If you want a good workout try Gilad's Bodies in Motion."
2,Mediocre,"I bought this DVD at Kmart for $8 and thought it was going to be super amazing after all the rave reviews, but was letdown. Pretty much you have to keep all eyes on her because she adds her own flair and doesn't tell you when she adds a movement in the mix. You'll be doing one arm movement then she mixes up the beat/reps. Most workout DVDs coach you along the way with reps, she's pretty much silent the entire. I liked that she didn't stop to teach you a move then go on, but I also didn't like that fact. This workout isn't too challenging or too complex. I think she could have condensed this down to half an hour workout, not 53 minutes. It's not high-intensity-so that's wonderful."
2,Eh,I cant believe I paid $30 for this video! I recently saw it WALMART for around $20 - def not worth it to buy and it's not that great of a workout. Didnt see results.
4,Good and Bad,"Just like everyone's comments, this dvd has pros and cons. For me, many of her moves are unique.Pros:- I like the chair routine because it reminds me of barre.- I like the arm routine because it kills my arms doing them.- I like TA has unique moves- lots of repetition, so you really feel the burnCons:- As many mentioned, there should be more instructions especially the isolation in the ribcage and leg routines. Sometimes I don't want to look at the tv screen all the time and I listen for cues for example to switch legs or if she wants us to look down and I like to wait for the next cue but TA already moves on without a word.- Not sure if I'm doing the leg routine correctly because of the minimal instructions.I will continue to add this dvd to my workout because I like to do different routines and workouts. I think I get bored easily. I am even more motivated because of the arm routine."
4,Worth it,This dvd is worth the money if you are already fit and want to break up your normal work out routine. You need to be very warmed up beforehand or you will surely injure yourself. Some of her moves are awkward and she doesn't really count off sets for you. You pretty much need to just follow along and eventually memorize her moves. The positive part of this dvd is that you will be sore in places you are not used to and will shock your underused muscles and encourage muscle confusion. I would buy it if you are sick of the treadmill and squats and want to try something new.
4,Great fat blaster,"I'm an ex-ballet dancer and gymnast. The exercises are hard, but so much fun if you like to dance. It was also great to be reminded that exercise can be fun. If you did an hour of cardio in addition to eating right I expect that one would see benefits."
2,Worst instructional fitness DVD ever!,"I have had this video for over 2 weeks and it is so hard to get the hang of this, nearly impossible. Tracy and her supporters gave me such high hopes for it but there is literally no instruction with the moves and she doesn't give you any idea that she is moving onto another move until she is already into it. It is annoying and extremely hard to get your body into the propper alignment with no instruction on what (or why) she is doing a particular move. I would not recomend this DVD to anyone, which is a shame. It is too bad that I don't have bookoo bucks to pay Tracy to be my trainer, then I can see someone getting results, because she would actually be there SHOWING you exactly. But NOT with her dvds. I really don't know why everyone is giving these such good ratings. It is not deserved. Sorry, Tracy, please make a new DVD where you can take your TIME and TEACH! You really do a diservice to your decade of work by making such a bad DVD."
2,"Previous reviews were ""right on""...","Everything in the reviews that I have read were right. Her video has very little instruction, but the music is great. I am wondering about over training of the muscles too especially doing this 5-6 days a week. I'm skeptical that I'm going to get ""teeny tiny arms"" doing this workout.Without her instruction it's hard to know if you are working out correctly also. Thanks to everyone for such good reviews and this will make a good supplemental workout, but in the meantime I ordered Jackie Warner's workout tape, it has recieved 5 stars across the board."
4,Another winner,"I love Tracy's workouts. I am a huge fan of barre-type workouts and Tracy's fits the bill, but with good music. Now her cueing is a concern for some people, but if you do a video enough times--you will get tired of hearing the same cues over and over so honestly I don't miss it. It's like working out WITH someone to me."
4,Use to mix up strength routine!,"I purchased this DVD after enjoying the Cardio Dance DVD. At first, I only felt the burn while doing the exercises and I was not that sore after I first did this workout - so now I really pay attention to form and just hit pause and add on more reps as I continue to use this DVD. To prevent boredom in general with exercise, after this DVD I sometimes add on my own traditional strength training (lunges, push ups) or do a segment from the Exhale DVDS and/or Jillian Michaels Shred. I recommend this workout! I do the Cardio Dance DVD 5-6 times a week - see my review."
4,I like the Floor Work,I really enjoyed the floor work but I wasn't crazy about the standing abs section. I also tend to skip over the arm section with the weights.
4,Great workout!,If the droning on of exercise folks gets under your skin this is for you. I love the fact that she doesn't go on and on and count for you. Yes you have to pay attention but after doing it 4 times you kind of know what is next and don't need someone telling you. I feel it in all those little muscles she is trying to strengthen. I feel sore after but still able to walk:)
3,Tracy Anderson DVD Review,You can definitely tell that this is one of her 1st DVD's. It is not user friendly in respect to walking you through her exercise program. You constantly have to keep you eyes on the screen to see what her next step is. She switches steps/moves with out telling you and so it is a bit hard to follow.Overall it is a great workout and you will see results.
2,Dissapointed in workout video,"I ordered this dvd after seeing her workout on the Oprah show. It is a hard workout to do. I wasn't impressed with Tracy in this video at all. She seems to almost be lauging at someone in the backround through the workout. Really kinda ticked me off. I didn't find anything funny about the workout. I was sore the next day, so it did work my muscles. I am not cordinated AT ALL and there are some moves that are rythm or danced based which I found difficult. She goes right into each exercise without much explantion or example. This workout is not for beginners. After beinf disappointed in this workout I did some research and decided to order The Bar Method and I really enjoyed this workout. The instructor in this workout explains each exercise and works at a good pace. You really feel the workout. I'm addicted to this dvd. It makes you feel so good afterward."
1,poor instruction,"She gives no instruction-utterly narcissistic, just like observing, not learning. Waste of money/time. Also, very cheaply produced. All for her & her buddy, Gwen, who actually is good at sharing what she knows..."
1,Not worth it,I'm a physical therapist and an exercise enthusiast. The method probably is effective if you have Tracy Anderson with you in the room otherwise it is poorly filmed(not shot from correct angles) and poorly directed. The mat ab work has the potential for neck and back strain. There are very few adaptations. Tracy needs to offer more instuction. It seems more like a performance than a teaching tool.
3,Interesting but not worth $30,"I have a whole library of workout DVD's and this is by far the most expensive. I think it's great at the most $15 but not $30. She doesn't have anyone else in it. Usually most DVD's will provide another instructor to show modifications if you can't do the actual move. She doesn't lead you into the next moves and just goes there. I'm sure after repetition of the DVD that won't be a problem. I am sore after the workout so I think it is a good addition. She says to only do her dance and mat 4-6 times/week but for someone who says repetition is a bad thing, I don't understand how doing the exact same workouts each day is going to make a big change."
1,Terrible instruction,"I do not know whether or not this workout is effective, and I will never know because I will never try it again. The instruction is RIDICULOUS!"
1,I am extremely disappointed!,Please don't waste your money! This is terrible! The instructions throughout the video are non-existent how on earth is anybody supposed to follow the moves if there are no instructions and you cannot even see what she is doing half the time. I am in the process of returning and can't wait what excuse there will be not give me my money back.
1,Horrible!,"Tracy's editing is horrible. Her moves unsafe. Even though she claims that her exercises are costumized for one's individual body type, she sells the same DVDs under different names which is false advertising!!! I wish I could sue her but she is not worth the effort."
3,Over-rated! Don't waste your money,"Not impressed at all! The leg work is good, but it's basically pilates techniques. The ab work and arm work are useless!"
4,Great,I really love this DVD and have done it several times already and seen results quickly. Especially in the butt area.
4,good workout- poorly cued!,"Although this is a good,tough workout it is THE most POORLY CUED cued one I have EVER done!It's like being at a club and trying to follow what everyone else is doing! The floor ab especially, since you are on your back and have no idea what is next, unless you stop to look up! I liked that it challenged me with so many repetitions but not having a clue what to do next was aggravating! I will do it again but still don't like the LACK of cuing."
5,arms tighter already-loving it,"While the hype around Tracy Anderson is controversial and her style unconventional this Mat workout is GREAT. I had no idea what to expect when ordering this but have found myself looking forward to doing this workout most evenings. The standing arm section is crazy challenging yet fun and very effective. She follows this up with a arm exercises using light weights which is my favorite part of the DVD. She has a dance-like style and fluent motions through each exercise. Her music selection is enjoyable, modern and not overbearing. Some have commented on her lack of prompting throughout the workout, but I find this a plus especially if you follow her advice and repeat the workout 4-5 times a week. Who wants to hear the same running commentary every day? After following along once or twice you can easily remember the order of each exercise no prompts necessary."
4,Great addition to workout dvd collection,"I'm already quite fit, but this workout did provide a challenge. I wasn't sore the next day, but my body was invigorated. If you are not already in pretty good shape then you will find this this workout to be a BIG challenge. There are lots of repetitive small movements to create muscle exhaustion. And if you aren't a naturally gifted mover you might feel clunky doing this workout. Especially the standing ab series where there is little verbal instruction, just visual cues. I do this video on weekends after a cardio workout, as Tracey recommends. Some people call her extreme, but she's just being honest. If you want really amazing results, you need to put in the time. Too many people in the U.S consider walking - or whatever other silly things that don't cause you pain - exercise. If you want to get fit, it's going to hurt a bit, and require some real effort. Does Madonna look like a wimp to you? No."
4,A different workout,"I think this DVD is quite different. I am use to doing heavy weights but I found this DVD to be a good one---I like working muscles that I did not know I had. The arm workout really surprised me, I did not think I would feel the ""burn"" with 3 pound weights but I truly did. The only thing that I would suggest is more cuing and showing you how to do certain routines/movements the correct way by the instructor, especially during the standing abdomen routine----I felt like, ""what I am suppose to do here"" and it was like watching Tracy doing an audition. Overall, I do see results."
2,Do not look for cuing on this DVD...it does not exist,"Unfortunately, this DVD does not offer any instruction regarding form; the cueing is not evident in Ms. Anderson's work. As a season fitness instructor for 20 years, I was profoundly disappointed with this DVD. My members and clients are complimentary that I always focus on the proper form and technique. I hoped that Ms. Anderson would acknowledge that she was not performing for herself but to assist others in achieving their fitness goals.A real disappointment for not only those new to exercising, but for instructors and the fitness industry as a whole."
2,Pay Attenttion,"OK, I do like the legs and arms of the video. However, the stand up abs work is just crazy, she just tells you to follow along, she can't be serious!! Tracy goes so fast like she is dancing in a club, you can not keep up to it, and she tells you that you will eventually get good at it... OK Tracy. The problem that I have with this workout is the fact she goes right into another position WITHOUT TELLING YOU!!! Are you kidding me????? You don't count while you are doing it, and if I am supposed to be doing these correctly then I should not be looking at the TV set. Tracy just does what she wants like I have been working out with her for years. It is almost like she hates the cameras. It aggravates the hell out of me she does not talk you through the video enough. She should make a better version of this, it is not fair that we pay the money for this and she does not talk enough through it. She may be a good trainer, but she NEEDS training on how to make a workout video.."
3,this one goes in the drawer,I had high hopes. I was a dancer when I was younger. I did the arms/body a few times. I do like that. But the dance portion is just tough to do unless you have a studio. You need a lot of floor space and must be able to see the screen to keep up.
5,WOW!!!!!!!!,"Wow!!!I love Tracy Anderson!!! my body now looks totally different, it has been only a few months since I begun my trainning with the TA method.I just got the mat workout DVD and I am having a blast!!!!!!!!!! I highly recommend the TA method to anyone who is ready to look great!!.."
1,Disappointing to say the least,I work out all the time (mostly running) about 5 times a week and was excited to try something new. and i have only done this once. this is the first workout regimine that i've ever attempted that i haven't stuck to - i don't normally just stop. the workout is slightly ridiculous. you basically watch her dance sexily. she gives about 2 words of instruction every 5 min. i thought it was an absolute joke. i'd save myself the money and frustration if i were you...
2,"Ok, not great","I have heard so much hype about Tracy Anderson that I thought I would give her dvd a try. I can't say it is the worst workout dvd I've done yet there were some definite negatives. Her cuing is essentially nonexistent. She looks painfully bored throughout the dvd. Also, it is clear she has no background in being a certified personal trainer given some of the moves with the weights were straining my neck so not exactly safe. I've made my own variations. After doing workouts with excellent cuing by people who clearly have the education and experience to demonstrate they know what they are talking about (Gunnar Peterson, Cathe, Joni Love for example), this dvd is a supplement, not my end all be all dvd to workout with."
5,BEST VIDEO EVER,You need to get this video as soon as you can get back to exercise after giving birth. It changed my whole body and I could see changes in only a few weeks!
4,Good all over work-out,"I have been doing this video 4-5 day s week for several weeks now. I have noticed some new definition and tightening in my arms and shoulders as well as my legs. Prior to doing this I was lifting medium to heavy weights with a personal trainer 2 to 3 days a week and would describe myself as physically fit.I was surprised at how challenging this video is - I did not think 3 pound weights would be hard since I had been lifting much heavier weights. There are alot of dance elements to this routine so if you are uncomfortable with that you might not like it. The lack of instruction and cueing can be frustrating at first, but once you have done it a few times it is fine. In fact it is preferable. The other thing to keep in mind is that it is almost a full hour work out so you need to be able to dedicate that much time."
4,Hard Work!,"I bought this DVD after seeing Gwyneth Paltrow on Oprah. Like Gwyneth I am a mom in my 30's who did not have a problem with excess baggage until recently (4 yrs ago). I saw my body morphing into my mothers which did the same in her 30's. I can do this workout! The first day I did it I hated it because it hurt (out of shape), immediately my muscles hurt all day afterward. I knew it was doing what I wanted! The following days I did the DVD were less difficult for me, it is STILL a workout though! Her lack of verbal cues are only a small problem (watch the plies), the moves are not that complicated that after a few times you catch on. I did take a day off after doing it 2 days in a row, I didn't want to hurt myself but now (a week after) I feel that I can do it everyday. I hurt in all the right places! If I had 2 hours, I would try her aerobic dance DVD too."
2,Misnamed Workout,"This workout is approximately 56 minutes long; only about 15 minutes or so are actually done on the mat, i.e., supine, prone, or on one's side. Apparently because she is standing on a mat while doing exercises, Anderson considers it a mat workout.The workout portion of the DVD is not chaptered (or at least the one I have isn't) which makes it as tiresome as a video tape because you have to speed through it if you only want to do certain sections of the workout.Instructions are minimal. While executing an exercise, she changes what she's doing at will (e.g., her arm movements) and mostly without any warning.The standing ab portion of this workout is laughable and seems useless, especially considering the poochy look of Anderson's own stomach.Overall I found Anderson's demeanor annoying and the exercises nothing special, unusual, or particularly effective. I have found better results in less time with the Exhale/Core Fusion workouts."
2,DVD was scratched and froze in DVD player,"I liked the first 12 minutes of the DVD; unfortunately, the DVD was scratched when I received it (even though it came wrapped in cellophane and was 'new'). My player could not play it and the DVD was either rejected or it would get stuck in my DVD player. Very frustrating and then I was not able to return it for a replacement DVD; rather I could only refund it through Amazon."
2,for people that never exercise,"I have seen a few interviews with her and wanted to have a workout cd at home but was very dissapointed as I think the video is for very beginners, and for people that do not exercise at all."
5,Feel the burn!,"don't be fooled, this work out will kick your but! You will definetaly work up a sweat!"
4,Problems with the standing abdominal exercises,The Tracy Anderson Method Presents Mat Workout DVDI would have like to give this DVD 5 stars except for the fact that after using it for 3 weeks I still cannot master the standing abdominal exercises. Now I just skipped that and use Gilads Body Sculpt for abdomen. When I first started I've to stop 5 times during the weight free arm exercises (I've been using 10 lbs weights for the last 2 years). I saw TA on an interview that she will be working on New DVDs and I hope she will provide more instructions especially the standing abdomen exercises.
5,I'm seeing results!,"I've been doing this dvd in conjunction with the post-preg dvd. I try to alternate the two dvds to keep it interesting, and I think they are both great! The TA Post-Pregnancy dvd is a lot of ab work where this one is more legs and arms, I would say. The exercises are very challenging and they target the smaller muscle groups so you won't get bulky. The Mat dvd is a lot of standing excerises actually, so be prepared for that. The moves don't look hard, but boy, my muscles were 'crying' the first few times! There is no cardio work here, so it would be great to pair it with your favorite cardio program, or try the TA Dance Cardio dvd if your coordinated enough. You'll need 3lb weights and a sturdy chair for some of the leg work. I'm a small person but I have a difficult time achieving a defined look with other workouts, this is the first time I actually have muscle definition without bulk!"
2,Mixed review,"I do like the exercises in this video, but have several complaints. Tracey does not say when she switches exercises most of the time, so you constantly have to be watching the screen, even while on the floor or when your head should be down. She also does things like say ""five more"" then will do 9 more. She also provides physiological information which she states as fact which is complete rubbish."
3,Lacking direction,"While Tracy has some great exercises, she is lacking in the way she teaches them. I've done tons of other videos and DVD's presented by quaified trainers and their cueing is usually excellent. She seldom tells the viewer what position their body should be in which might be difficult for a lot of people to follow especially if they are new to exercising. Her method is intense which I find to be a good thing, but she assumes, for example, that everyone knows what an ""attitude"" position is. I think she is on to something different in her exercise approach, I just wish she knew how to put that across instructionally on the DVD."
3,Pretty good...although there are better barre workouts out there.,"This Mat Workout was pretty good...the music was exceptional for a fitness workout. As others have said, the cueing could have been much better. And no chaptering? What's That all about?! I probably would like this workout much better if there had been some chaptering involved!I didn't feel very sore in the legs after this one, which is usually how I know that my legs got really worked. Can't speak for the arm section because I didn't use weights (all of the talk about the soreness in the arms kinda scared me away)!I recommend Tracy Effinger's Squeeze workouts over this one...chaptered and much better cueing."
4,Review of Mat workout by Tracy Anderson,I love this workout however Tracy does need work with cueing instructions to her audience. Her moves are great. You can feel the changes in your body after 2 weeks of 4X a week.
3,There's definitely some room for improvement,"The workout itself is not bad, I can definitely see the benefits and I felt them the next day. As far as her instructiuon there is little, which does make it very difficult to follow, especially when you head is down and the exercise has changed. Also it might helf if Tracy was a little more vocal with her encouragement as there are so many reps. A very average first attempt, I'm sure there will be more dvd's to come which hopefully have been improved."
1,Very bad instructions.,"Tracy Anderson is not very good with telling you the next move, it's more like watch and copy. Unlike other trainers like Jillian Michaels, she actually give you step by step instruction and really explains the next move."
4,a solid workout,"i ordered this DVD and use it a few times a week. i got it 2-3 weeks ago, and i still get sore the day after i do it. so i figure that's a good sign. this workout would be the most beneficial for a person who has some dance experience--the moves require the same maintenance of posture that dance does, but Tracy Anderson fails to talk much about it. i agree with previous reviewers that Ms Anderson doesn't do much verbal instruction for users; it's mostly left to the user to figure out the small details of the moves. throughout the DVD, she doesn't do all that much talking or instruction. but the routine is solid, and so far i like the results i'm getting. the music is fairly mellow, but i like it. overall, i'd recommend this DVD to anybody with a history of dance lessons, who has good personal discipline and doesn't need much motivation from their instructor."
3,exercise,"Don't let the simple moves on this tape fool you, I was sore the next day after this tape. The moves on this tape remind me a lot of callenetics which I love. The only reason I gave this video 3 stars instead of 5 is because Tracy's cuing is terrible. She moves from one exercise to another without telling you, which is a problem, especially when she has you doing moves where you are facing away from the television."
2,good exercises/bad instructor,"I just finished Tracy's mat workout dvd and although I liked some of the exercises,I found her method to be less than perfect. I spent more time watching than doing because she changes exercises without telling you. For example during her standing abs she moves side to side then back to front then all around without a word. There didn't seem to be a count of any kind . I pretty much had to watch her dance in place. Maybe once I learn her routine I will like it better. It take a long time to do her mat work and I've had better workouts, targeting the same muscle groups, doing yoga. It's not worth the money."
3,Good and Bad,The good... exercises are challenging (arm section is a killer!) and you feel like you are definitely working if you do them correctly. The bad... Tracy is not the best teacher. There are large periods of time where she says nothing and with many of the exercises she doesn't really explain how to do them or what you should be feeling. She also doesn't give any reminder cues (i.e. keep abs pulled in or specific cues to the movement). It's basically follow the leader and if you have a background in dance or pilates you'll fare better. The standing abs section is particularly difficult to master without any real teaching help from Tracy.
3,Tracy Anderson Method Mat DVD,"Great workout, though she doesn't always walk you through proper form, and change of movements. If you're watching your own form, she might have switched through two different movements - without saying anything - and you miss it. The other thing that's a bummer is that you can't skip to different parts of the workout. She says in the video that if you want to feel more challenged - repeat the sequence - but you can't skip forward or backward - you have to start the mat routine all the way at the beginning. Kind of a waste."
3,This isn't the workout for everyone,I wanted to try something different and have seen Tracy on tv and in magazines. Sounded interesting. I don't doubt that you could get fabulous results with this program. I just felt I needed more instruction then what it offers. I'm not comfortable enough with my ability to do this correctly at this point. I will come back to it after I spend some time on more traditional options. If you are good doing intensive work on your own and like doing lots of reps and pushing to the point of fatigue then you will like it.
2,Needs to learn to give direction,"I have many of the Tracy Anderson DVDs and I like the workouts (steer clear of her dangerous diet!), but she needs to work on giving direction. She will switch legs in the middle of the exercise and not say anything. If you are on all fours doing the workout, it is impossible to watch her the whole time. Her dance cardio is VERY hard to follow. She changes her movements constantly without giving any direction, by the time you catch up she's moved on to something else. I'm sure when Gwyneth Paltrow works out with her one on one, the instruction its a far superior experience, but for those of us trying to follow at home it leaves a great deal to be desired."
2,knees hurt so bad!,"I was first really enthusiast about this video and has been doing it 6 days a week during 2 weeks but i decided to stop as my knees hurts really bad, i have troubles going up the stairs and walking... Do not purchase this video if your joints are a little fragile. It makes me sad because i was really starting to see improvements in my body... I guess i would rather not be in pain, gonna check out other dvd's..."
2,Long Video,"Did the video for the first time and was like, wow, that felt pretty good. Very different from what I was used to. Instructions suggest doing this video 4-6 times per week. The first week I did it four times, but by the 2nd and 3rd time I was so BORED... The music is super mellow and not engaging, and it moves so slow and is ONE hour long... I was just looking for something to throw into my workout routine, but this one just isn't engaging enough."
2,60 min to work two muscles in your body (butt and shoulders),"I am surprised that anyone who is in decent shape could be challenged by this workout. It only works exactly two muscles in your entire body: your butt and your shoulders. Personally, I do not have 60 min every day to do only that and never even get my heart rate elevated. The ab workout is an absolute joke, really, you are supposed to get abs by shaking your midsection left and right a couple of times? No wonder that she does not have much muscle definition herself, her body is no inspiration, at least on this workout. I may use this as a supplemental workout on days when I feel tired and don't want to challenge myself too much, but again, 60 min of that???"
3,no SEGMENT DIVISIONS for that ol' VHS Experience????,"The workout itself is a 5 star. I like every aspect of her moves and cuing. I'm even willing to (try and) ignore the insipid music. BUT SHE COULD NOT LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD. I can understand how, in principle, she might WANT us all to be able to commit to SIXTY MINUTES several days a week EVEN THO THIS COULD HAVE BEEN DIVIDED INTO 5 SEGMENTS FOR THOSE MOMENTS WHEN SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING. So instead, I find myself laboriously FAST FORWARDING to each SEGMENT (and she certainly knows that are indeed segments, because the DVD goes to BLACK IN BETWEEN EACH). So in case anyone else would have liked to CHOOSE what they actually have the time for each morning/day...here's my approximate breakdown)PART 1. 00:00 (Standing & CHAIR)PART 2. 21:00 (Standing -no equipment)PART 3. 33:00 ARMS (weights)PART 4. 41:00 LEGS (mat)PART 5. 48:00 ARMS (mat)PART 6: 54:00 Final Stretch(Maybe adding divisions surpassed their price-point?)"
4,good workout. different from others.,"This video is a great supplement to other DVD's. It is not a big impact ""cardio"" workout but more ballet type strengthening moves. I really enjoy this as a compliment to other workouts. It is pretty ""mellow"" so nice option for morning."
4,Great body-weight workout,"When I want a to be nice to myself and take a break from the Jillian Michaels Video series, and I have a little more time, I love this workout. I'm always very sore afterwards!"
1,don't waste your time,"This video is the biggest joke!!!! She basically moves around without telling you much of anything. Just when your ready to do one movement, she switches to another without telling you and also, isn't breathing important? She doesn't say anything about holding in the core or when to breath in or out. I found this dvd extremely frustrating unless you are a hard core exerciser yourself!!!! I'm sure Ms Paltrow gets more instruction when working one on one with Ms. Anderson!!!!"
5,Amazing Mat Workout,"Okay so I took a chance and purchased the Tracy Anderson Mat Work Out DVD. I didn't really know much about her other then what I read from the reviews and I am not disappointed! Her DVD is quite different than anything I have tried before. As mentioned in the other reviews there isn't a lot of direction but if you watch it once through before exercising-you will be fine. I have been doing it for two weeks and I can already see the difference both with my how my body looks and my endurance! Yah for Tracy! I don't agree with some of her nutritional or weight techniques, however her DVD is wonderful. My arms and butt look great!"
3,Not worth the price!!!,"As other reviews say, Tracy does NOT cue well. While the actual exercises aren't overly difficult, she moves from exercise to exercise without telling you. So you'll be laying on the floor doing abs, getting into the move, and you glance at the tv and she's doing something totally different. I liked the standing legs and floor abs. The standing abs were ridiculous (I can't even try to describe what she was doing). The arm part was kind of weird- some moves were good but a lot was doing birdlike movements. My muscles weren't sore at all the next day.Tracy needs to improve her cuing, motivation, add tougher exercises, maybe countdown- some moves you do lots of reps, others you do like 4 reps. You just never know where you're going with this dvd which makes it hard to enjoy. It just seems like something she threw together at the last minute. Also, there is no chapter selection option- so if I wanted to just do the abs, I have to FFwd through the whole dvd. Annoying."
5,I'M BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"After being diagnosed wth Lupus I was quite unsure as to what I was going to do for exercise as eveything I did caused a huge amount of inflammation in mY body. After trying Tracy's uncOnventional style of movement which targets not only the large muscles but calls upon the ""little muscules"" to help out I found parts of my body I hadn't seen in years and oddly enough all the workout hurt with none of the inflammation. I was good enough to keep working out and after 2 weeks even more of my lost comrad body parts starting showing up. Had me saying in the mirror... I'M BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Good toning workout but in a weird way.,"This was a weird video. Although the arm and leg segments (done primarily with your own body weight) are good toning exercises, I felt as if Tracy wasn't ""all there"" for the video. She kind of threw in her own movements here and there as if she were dancing with herself, and had her hair down and in her face most of the time. More of an exotic chair dancer vibe as opposed to the more aggressive Jillian videos I am used to. Plus she also says you should NEVER lift more than 3 pound weights or you will bulk up. Having worked out with a trainer for years lifting heavier weights I am not ""bulky."" I will probably use this video for those days when I want to workout but not be a big sweatball."
4,good stuff,"looks easy,but not really, you really feel the burn if do it right. nice music to go with the workout. Great dvd to mix up with your other workout dvd for a nice change."
2,????,The workout is nice but I did not feel like I was being led by a professional fitness person. No instruction and poor neck alignment in the upper body portion really frightened me. there seemed to be no real format. I'm hoping her more recent videos are better made.
3,"Good workout, but Poor Instruction","Make no mistake -- this workout is challenging. You really FEEL it, in a good way. I'm sure doing this workout several times a week will yield an impressive body. However, I was really disappointed that Tracy is such a lousy instructor.She changes positions and exercises often without saying anything, so if you are looking anywhere but the screen at ALL times (hard to do in many positions), you won't see that she's changed positions again. She also fails to explain what exactly she is doing when she takes up new positions. Most video instructors spell out how your body should be positioned, but she does not.She seems to get lost in her own world of dance moves toward the end, so it's hard to follow, even for someone who used to dance often.In short, the workout seems to be a good one, but you have to go through it several times to figure out just what you should be doing and when."
5,Tracy Anderson Presents Mat Workout,"This is an excellent as well as challenging workout. If you are looking for something different from the usual weight routines or are concerned about bulking up, this is the video for you.You will be using muscles that you didn't even know you had! The music and presentation is beautiful as well which always makes a workout routine more enjoyable.I have been doing this routine for approximately 3 weeks now and have started to see results.I hope Tracy will develop more videos for those of us who prefer to workout at home."
2,Tracy Anderson Mat Workout Review - not up to the hype,"I was extremely excited to get this dvd, and do like though it is not without its problems. The biggest problem is that Tracy doesn't give detailed instruction on the correct positioning required for the poses. This is further exacerbated by the fact that the camera angles are lousy, and shows her doing the excerices, from behind a chair! I am a yoga teacher and know how imperative it is to teach people correct positioning to avoid injury. Her uppper belly workout is far too advanced to teach without any instruction at all, but I think her leg exercises are easy enough to pick up. I also saw a separate video of her on YouTube where she says to up your repetitions to about 100 a day of each exercise. There is NO mention of this in the dvd. It's almost as if she's trying NOT to really let you in on her secret method."
4,Good workout,"I like this dvd...although i was expecting it to be a wee bit harder. The arm section is killer but I'm left with wanting more muscle soreness the following day (sick right? - lol) I like that the moves are ""old school"" lots of reps/ light weights and I do think most people will get good results. Especially good for beginners to intermediate levels. More advanced levels may want to add light weights to your ankles. Overall its a fun little video with a dance like vibe."
1,waste of money!,"Tried out the tracey anderson mat workout Dvd, and it was the worst exercise routine i have even tried. I have been exercising for the past 8 years and would say i am quite experienced. First of all her attitude in the video is not at all motivating, she acts as if she would rather be somewhere else! The stomach routine was the worst, it was so silly and not easy at all to follow. Stomach exercises standing up and dancing around just dont work!! To conclude, dont waste your money, just beause she mentions Madonna or Gwen. Paltrow on her website. Such celebrities have people to watch out for their whole lifestyle (food, nutrition, health etc.) . They dont look the way they do because of a few minutes of a useless mat workout!"
1,Leaves lots to be desired,This video leaves a lot missing. There is no instruction on keeping proper form to start with. It left me with a sore shoulder for days and was definitely too intense for me. I would like to see the video divided into sections so you could pick out which body areas to work on. I will probably never use the video again and do not recommend it.
5,the tracy anderson method,"Tracy Anderson and her staff are some of the most caring in the workout business. I received an amazing workout and the staff are extremely polite. I highly recommend any of her workout videos...if anything ever needs to be exchanged, you will get a real person to speak with in a timely manner. I am so impressed."
4,Great workout - results will happen if you can keep up,"I really enjoy this workout. It's not an easy workout at all. In fact, it takes a while to be able to keep up and make it through the whole video. The exercises are simple, lots of repetition, well thought out, and really works the muscles groups she aims for."
4,beginner/intermediate workout dvd,"i fully support the ideas behind tracy's workout method, however i am an experienced athelete and former dancer, so the moves and routines are a little too easy and simple for me. this is a great dvd for a beginner/intermediate exerciser. music during the workout is boing and tracy doesnt talk much so its kind of a snoozer/uninspiring workout dvd; if your looking for high energy, it is not."
4,"Good workout, requires minimal equipment","Finally a good workout DVD that is simple but surprisingly challenging. I could not complete the entire workout the first few times I did it, but it gets easier if you stick with it. Even my athletic daughter struggled to get thru the first time. You will definitely feel it in your arms and thighs after doing these exercises! The only equipment you need is a mat (or towel), chair, and small weights. The only negative is that Tracy Anderson does not do a good job of vocalizing the movements, it relies on visual, so when you are in a position that you can't see the TV, it's hard to know when to change position. Eventually you learn the moves, so I still rate it highly."
2,It's okay but not $30 Great!,"Really not worth $30 just because Madonna and friends are her clients. I didn't find this that revolutionary and worth $10- $20 more then most other DVD. I agree with almost all the other reviews that TA needs to instruct more. I'm over all disappointed, I had high expectation after hearing so much about the workout."
3,not instructional,"even though her method makes sense, she doesn't present it in a way thats easy to follow without watching every move. I feel like you need a dance background to follow successfully"
1,"1 month & 3 days after the order, still no DVD....",I ordered the DVD 1 month and 3 days ago and I still haven't received it.Paying 36.43$ for a DVD and not have it yet is just a joke.Never again.
5,Great Video,My wife loves it. I can see results on her with this video and cant on others + Tracy is hot. What more is there to love?
3,tracy anderson Mat workwout,After a lot of problems getting the DVD. I has arrived 23 after shipped.Dvd seems good. Not used it much though. Tracey Anderson mat workout
1,If I could give it ZERO stars I would!,Horrible. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! A waste of my money & a waste of time. This workout is awful and so is she. DO NOT BUY!!
4,Tracy Anderson's mat workout,"This is a video I will do over and over again. I like the music. The only problem is that you can't go exactly where you want to with the dvd. It isn't divided into chapters so if there is a particular body part that you want to work you have to fast forward through the whole dvd to get to it. Other than that, I like it. It's a little tough to do at first but it gets easier as you get stronger."
3,"It's ok, doesn't live up to the hype","This is an ok video, there are some awkward leglifts you gotta do for anyone that's not use to ballet moves. The standing ab section is hard to do properly if you don't know how to move your body that way. My most favorite part is her arms section. I LOVE her arms section. It doesn't bulk you and really burns your arms. In my opinion, this video should've been [...] bucks."
4,Pretty good,"I have been doing this workout 5-6 times a week for the past month and have already seen a big difference in my arms and glutes. The ab section is very light, so I always add the ab section of the post-pregnancy workout to keep it well rounded. The dvd still challenges me (especially the arm section w/weights), so I will definitely keep it in my regular home workout rotation. :)"
3,hard but works,"you feel like a total idiot doing this workout, she moves all crazy, doesn't explain the upcoming moves so you kind of get off base. You can really feel that the workout is working once you get on track. I will agree she does not speak much and the work out is very tough, which is great because otherwise there would be no benefits right? Hard but works."
3,The Tracey Anderson Method Mat Workout DVD,"Along with other reviews, this DVD could have been a lot better in terms of explaining how to do certain motions, and being more intricate. She could have also explained more about what each movement was doing; like most workout DVDs, but besides that - the DVD is great! I can feel my muscles working, so regardless... if you're good at mirroring others, this is a great DVD. Make sure you have plenty of room to work around in! I can barely do the ""leg"" activities because of my small apartment, and long legs."
3,Great ab routine,"If any of you know about Tracy Anderson, you would know not to expect any good cuing in this workout. You really have to find a good angle to see what she is doing at all times, which is also bad when you are doing floor work for your abs. It is a great workout though and you will definitly feel the burn. I do not care what she says about lifting weights makes you bulky, I lift heavy and incorporate a variety of workouts into my routine and went from a 15 to a size 4."
4,Pretty hard core stuff,"Great DVD, really happy I bought it. Tough! First time I did it I couldn't complete the hour, it just got harder and harder. Haven't bought an exercise DVD for ages, would recommend this one, slowly built up to be able to complete it. Only improvement would be if the sections were broken up so that if you only had 20mins you could immediately jump into a specific section."
2,Hardly any instruction going on at all,This workout is interesting but she doesn't verbalize enough. She changes what she is doing (often quickly) without cues and it's often not clear what she is doing specifically enough to follow. It is kinda of odd at times like she is doing the workout for herself rather than to teach. For me a lot of what she is doing is totally new and unfamiliar (I think that is part of her purpose - its her unique workout approach) so I don't have any previous instruction to fall back on as one might with more typical workout routines.I'm used to yoga instruction where you can focus on your own movement and follow basic verbal cues from the instructor and not have to decipher what is going on.
1,Impossible,"I think the system would work, but it is impossible to follow what she it doing with such little verbal instruction. You find you are trying to watch the screen and then attempt to do the moves. It is frustrating and I was glad I didn't buy the more expensive product."
4,Works for me,"I've been using this for 3 weeks, and I've lost 3 pounds. I like that it's low impact yet I'm usually sweating within 15 minutes. I actually like that she doesn't talk a lot except at times when I'm not looking at the TV, such as during the ab section.I also have the dance DVD and do NOT like it at all."
5,This is really working,"I bought the dvd after ruminating on it for weeks. It arrived and I've been doing it for about 3 weeks now, not as often as Tracey suggests, about 2-3 times per week, yet I am still feeling and seeing a difference. I am a long-distance runner and I find me knees have hurt less because of the leg work, and my arms, which have been chunk-a-lunk all my life are getting long, lean lines - I feel firmer and more attractive. I won't lie, it's hard work, but it is something really relaxing and fun, I look forward to doing it. Get this if you're thinking about it, it's a great investment."
5,Great workout!,"I think this is a great workout. I've done them all - Pilates, Jillian, Workout... you name it. I run and do this video 5 days a week as she suggests. It is definately challenging my muscles in a whole new way which I love. And I'm pretty sold on her concept of building the smaller accessory muscles instead of the larger ones that tend to make me feel bigger. Also love her stomach workout. In a month I've seem some huge changes."
4,Tracy Anderson method mat,"This is not a work out for beginners as she gives minimal vocal instructions and you have to keep looking up at the screen. Also, she says how important it is to keep hands and feet pointed or flexed, however on some movements I can't tell what she's doing with her feet. All that said, this looks to be a great work out. One big BAD design is that I accidently hit the stop button and am now fast forwarding through the first 20 minutes of the DVD looking for where I left off. It would have been better if there was a way to skip forward to the leg, arm, or ab section. BAD DESIGN."
4,Saga of the Royal Marines,"This is the story of a young officer in the Royal Marines during the transition from sail to steam. The hero is from a Marine family, yet is thinking of leaving the Service. This is the background for the adventures off the African coast and in the Med. You see some of the resistance to change in the outlook of the Navy to steam and the new and strange machines. Possibly the start of a series. If you have read any of Alexander Kent's Bolitho series, you will like this."
3,Badge of Glory.,"Reeman writes in meticulous detail in this, and all his stories. This novel is fast paced, the characters are well described and the conflicts are understandable and resolved in logical fashion. All his Royal Marine novels are good. This one is slightly better than average."
4,A good read with a solid historic background,"I had read (and re-read) several of the Alexander Kent Bolitho novels and enjoyed them. When I discovered that Douglas Reeman had written a series on the Royal Marines, I wanted to see how well his style translated. The story is an enjoyable read. The author captures the sense of the ethos of the organization from training to unit cohesion while recognizing the good, and bad in leaders and individuals. He describes the difference between the real human reactions of fear and doubt in the face of a dangerous and chaotic situation, and the need to lead and act. I previewed it on my Kindle and then bought it, so that must be a vote for."
3,Fila fan impressed with the antics of Power Clown,"Although not quite as diverse or involving as ""Mess"" / ""Mame that Tune"", this album still delivers some excellent tracks (""Feathery Legs"" is classic Brazillia, ""Little Hands Rouge is just... out there!). Fila fans will not be dissapointed."
4,"""An Economy of Words, A Wealth of Information""","Imagine how much easier life would be if you're struggling with a corporate intranet, e-process mapping, corporate learning, tools, knowledge leadership, middle management, communications shortfalls, web initiatives, collaboration strategies and overall knowledge management issues, if you could have Tom Koulopoulos and Carl Frappaolo by your side. If you need ""smart"" answers to tough questions regarding your company's approach to KM, Tom's passion and Carl's keen observational skills are a potent combination. Pick up Smart Things To Know About Knowledge Management; it's a tiny investment of your time and attention to benefit from their years of expertise and involvement with over 400 corporate KM projects."
3,"Good book, repeated ideas",This book has many interesting ideas that are repeated. The author's previous book Corporate Instinct was a much better read.
5,"Carla Comments on Smart Things to Know About, Knowledge Mgmt","Smart Things To Know About Knowledge Management is a worthwhile book for physicians to read. The clear language avoids abstract theoretical postulates and jargons. Techniques are clearly explained. In keeping with the editorial guidelines of the Smart Things Series, the key concepts of value, organization, storage and exchange of information are comprehensively, yet concisely analyzed. Koulopoulos and Frappaolo have written a useable introductory text on knowledge management for business, healthcare and medical practitioners.Carla J. Emery, DPM"
4,Completely overdone and worth it,"Yes $$$ seems like a lot, but if you are looking at this item you are not trying to find a cheap bar set (amazon has plenty of other sets for that). This is something to show off with your premium alcohols.My only reason for only 4 out of 5 stars is the fact that the strainer and stirer (ie the train wheels) do not stay on well. However, the plus is they will go on either side making the set viewable from either the left or right side."
5,Beautiful Cocktail Set...,"This is simply an awesome looking set. Unfortunately for me however for the short period of time it was available, there was no way of shipping it to the UK so I have not been able to purchase it!If anyone can let me know of how to locate this item please do so! Even in a good quality 2nd hand condition I would be interested."
5,I love it!,I have tried many squeegee's before and it was such a waste. I reluctantly ordered this one because of the reviews and I am so glad I did. It works great. No streaks and clean windows! I use it with the Ettore super concentrate liquid.
4,Great to curl up with!,"This is the first book I've read by Holly L. Huff, and I'm hooked. I was drawn in right away and the book kept me guessing until the end. This isn't a sweet romance, but one that delves deep into the heart of the characters. The main characters' plight became very real and I found myself biting my nails through the plot twists. I'll be looking for more from this author!"
4,Luke at his best!!,If you like Luke shows....this is the dvd for you!! Considering ive seen other Luke videos....this is not his best...but it is a must see if you're a fan of his work!!
4,Pretty ....good book,"WOW! Rarely do I pick up a book and it grips me right away. I decided to read this one because I left the book I meant to read at work that night. I skimmed the prologue and was hooked and the book was devoured in days. Talon a street mage from Boston must deal with the mistakes of his past. Youthful anger and loss can create your worst enemies. How do you do battle when the enemy is of yourself. yadd yadda. All I can say is it is not a disappointment. I have long strayed from the shadowrun world of books, but now I may come back...."
3,"Good, but not great","This book was pretty good. It had interesting characters and plot. However, you really had to know the universe in order to understand what was going on. Not for the new Shadowrun reader."
2,Silly Movie,"Good actors, but somewhat of a silly movie with a weak scrip. I wouldn't purchase it again."
4,That 70s show DVD boxset,"DVD boxset arrived as agreed. Boxset: okay quality. Not ratet with five stars, due to errors in subtitles."
3,Beware the measurements!,"I like these curtains very much but unfortunately the listed length of 84"" was off by about a foot. I managed to make them work anyway, but don't buy for very long windows."
2,Amazon fails - this is ONLY for wood doors,"I love Amazon but guys go to ACE or Lowes or Home Depot for stuff like this. I ordered this and like every hardware item I order on Amazon it's too short, or does not fit, or is wrongly labeled..... THIS one is for wood doors only I have a aluminum door so it does not work and I'm too lazy to return it - OFF to goodwill it goes. If others are lazy like me man up and go to a local hardware store realize you have the wrong item, then go back 2 more times that day, DON'T buy stuff like this on Amazon."
3,response to previous reveiw,"The 'author' of Freud's S.E. IS Freud ! ! and of course it's a useful reference book for any undergraduate student of psychoanalysis, Freud is still papa of the discipline and anyone interested in being involved in any discourse concerning psychoanalysis needs to be familiar with the man's work."
1,AWFUL,"I purchased two safeseat step 2 toddler seats in stellar. Several weeks after our purchase we took the cover off of one and found that a large chunk of the ""saftey foam"" came off too. We figured it might have been that way from shipping and had the seat replaced. However, with the next seat we had them placed in the middle and door seat in a Durango. An adult leaned over the middle seat,to reach the door seat, and the foam popped off of that seat too. The foam is bulky and easy to damage, in our opinion. Also our two yr olds had no leg room in the first row of our 04 Quest if either front seat reclined."
2,Defective,"As with the other review on this car seat, after about two months of use, the foam on one side broke off of the car seat. I am now having to deal wtih trying to return it or exchange it but would rather get a different seat altogether."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book several years ago when I was setting up a home network with a wireless router and a few PC's on wired connections. The book goes way overboard in extolling all of the things you can do with networking. However, when it comes down to practical detail--it is sorely lacking. For instance, I needed to know which lines were active on a CAT-8 cable (I needed to 'share' one cable between an ethernet link and a tip/ring phone). Was this bit of practical information to be found? No. However a quick search on the internet and I got the schematic for the standard CAT-8 connection and my PC and POTS phone were peacefully coexisting. Sadly, I returned this book to the shelf where it has been collecting dust ever since."
5,Necessary for certification students,"This book is a necessary addition to your library if you are studying for certifications such as MCSE, MCSA, MCDBA, ORACLE, SUN JAVA 2, CIW, MCAD, MCSD, and so on. These certifications generally test your ability operate (writing programs, installing OS, creating and managing Websites and databases, etc) in a corporate environment with Server machines and Server software such as Windows 2003 Server or Linux. Use this book to build a small but cheap test network to approximate a real corporate network - the principles are the same. Then purchase the Microsoft certification books from amazon - MS PRESS books usually have trial editions of the enterprise level software that would be quite expensive for a poor student. Then study your heart out and be free to experiment as you wish. And yes, I did get my MCSA this way. Good luck!"
3,Pretty good,I bought this to throw in the camping kit with the thought that if it got trashed I wouldn't be out much. I am satisfied with the sound - a good drum for the price.
3,It works,"Simple enough, it stops that old DS Lite from gathering dust by making it usable. NO MORE EXPENSIVE PAPER WEIGHTS!"
3,Its a charger,"Its just like the one that came with my Nintendo DS lite. Mine didn't come in the package like in the picture but it works just fine, I do like that the prongs fold into the charger so I can store it better. Not really much else, it charges my DS exactly what its supposed to do."
1,Concerned about misrepresented packaging,I am bothered by the fact that the item here does not come in the box as pictured and concerned about reports of warranty voids. If it isn't in the appropriate packaging how do we know who really makes it? We did follow another reviewer's advice and picked one up at Target for $12 that is packaged in the box shown here.
4,It Is What It Is,"This AC Adapter for the Nintendo DS Lite is identical to the one that comes included with the game system.One nice feature is that the prongs of the plug swivel in and out. This means that, when folded in, the unit is fairly thin and easy to store. It seems well made and sturdy, even with the moving part."
2,NOT A NINTENDO CHARGER! It's a CHEAP IMITATION!,"You think by the description and the pictures that you are ordering a REAL Nintendo DS charger in a Nintendo box. Nope. Just look at the picture that I have posted. It is a cheap, Chinese imitation."
1,Misrepresented,"This product is advertised as new. It is NOT NEW! Upon opening the package, it is not in factory packaging, it is simply wrapped in a plastic bag. When I take it out the cord has dirt on it. You are not fairly representing your product at all. After asking for a return Video Closeout agrees to refund my purchase minus shipping...That being said the product does work; however, this experience leaves a VERY POOR taste in my mouth and knowing that if I do the proper thing and return the item I end up having to lose Money just doesn't seem right.I will not purchase anything from Video Closeout again. I don't like misrepresentation, I don't like that the item I purchased has dirt and scratches on it and I REALLY DON'T LIKE your displaying a new product when what you are buying is USED."
1,Did I get a wrong adapter?,"I ordered an international adapter i.e. 120-240V, as mentioned on the website. But today when I got the package, it says it supports only 120V and there is no mention of international voltage support."
1,Not the real deal,I didn't receive a DS AC adapter like pictured on the site. I receive a DS adapter in a little white box. Not an official Nintendo box. It looks to be a 3rd party charger. Also knew it was not original due to it has no UL Listed which it should have.
2,Came in plain white box and looks used,I received my product in a little white box not in the advertised box. It also appears to be used as there is a slight amount of rust on the adapter. I hope the charger works for a long time because the seller was very deceptive in their process to the public.
1,Dead after little use,"This adapter worked for only several charges before it died. I bought the rocketfish combo pack (wall and car) from best buy for what I wasted on off brands from Amazon. Stay away from this and other ""off"" brands."
5,Beware when buying from third party,"I purchased the advertised original Nintendo adapter, but did it from a third party seller on amazon.Well, I received a knock off in a plain white box. It works but, it is not supposed to be this way.Offered to refund but never did, or to have receiving it back at my expense, so it would end up costing me more that if I actually went to a local store and bought one, so I bit the bullet and let it pass.Since I'm reviewing the original product, 5 stars. (even the one I got is OK so far)"
4,Works fine but...,"I bought this DS AC adapter for my DS Lite, which hasn't had a power cord for a few years now. The cord works great. My only qualm would be that I thought I was getting a brand new DS AC adapter in its original container, Instead I received a white box filled with peanuts and a used looking AC adapter that had dents and scrapes in it. It said Nintendo on the back so I guess it wasn't a knockoff, but still, I bought the 5$ more expensive one so that I could have a brand new one, rather than the $2 other one that wasn't brand new. Either way, I wont be returning it, as the return cost is more than 1/3 the price of the item. I just thought I'd write a note here. Seems some people got what they ordered, and some people got what I received. I did give the seller feedback on the item before writing this review."
3,False advertising,"I purchased this with the notion that it was ""new"" and came in the box as appeared in the picture...it does not. It comes in a slightly see through white bag. It has some very minor marks as if it were previously used. If it was for me, I honestly would not care but it's a Christmas present but I guess it will have to do. It was cheap enough anyway so it isn't a total loss but I just don't appreciate the fact that it says new because it's obvious it isn't."
5,Great adapter,This has been a great adapter. Have had no problems with it. I would recommend if you need an extra or lost the original.
5,Great charger,I loved the price of this charger and i was even more happy with the fact that it was the exact charger that came with the original DS Lite!!
5,It does what it's supposed to do,"It charges my DS, it works. What more could you ask for in a power adapter? It's made by the manufacturer, so you know it should be compatible."
2,Misleading Packaging,"I recently ordered this adapter to replace my lost one. The reviews were better than others (although I didn't read them, which I should have) so I decided to give it a try. It came in on time but when I opened the package, the adapter was in a cheap plastic packaging bag. It does have the Nintendo logo embedded in it so I don't think it's counterfeit but this is still unsettling. It charged my DS nonetheless and that is all I really need out of the product, but this is VERY misleading on Amazon's part. And no, I did not order from a private seller. I ordered straight from Amazon. 1 star for the timely shipping. 1 star for a working product. Quality and Professionalism are nonexistent here and I wasn't completely satisfied so 3 stars dropped there. Bad Form, Amazon. Bad Form."
1,"Just ask ""Why?""","So, I'm in Europe and plug in the Nintendo OEM charger and poof, out comes the magic smoke that makes it work. Turns out the adapter is ONLY for 120v in. In a world where you can get a great quality USB charger that works worldwide for $3, why would you waste your time on this thing? Do yourself a favor and buy a charger that can handle 120V through 240V. It's just about every USB charger out there except for Nintendo's. Shame on you, Nintendo."
1,Nintendo DS Lite Adapter,"This paticular DS Lite power adapter is quite frankly garbage. Yes it charges the DS Lite, but it also creates feed back noise in the speakers and a line runs from bottom to top on the screen. The Picture representing the item wass that of a Nintendo Certified Product. This is not what I recived...Also the cord is really really short only about half as long as the one that came with my DS Lite. Very dissatisfied with this product. I won't return it because the shipping is possibly more than what I paid for it."
3,"Nintendo branded AC adapter, not packaged in original box","I received my AC Adapter today and was a little disappointed that it did not come in a Nintendo box as show in the picture, but rather a flimsy protective sleeve... Unlike other buyer's, the AC adapter I received IS a Nintendo branded item, with the plug that swivels. I haven't yet tested the charger on my son's DS lite yet, so I can't say either way if it works. I am a little concerned about whether or not it is a used charger, since it did not come in original packaging. I was expecting a new one, although I can't say with any certainty that it isn't. There are no scratches or any visible signs of wear. I guess that's a good sign...I've checked it out and everything works great! :D"
2,Not made by Nintendo,"The charger I received worked fine on the DS, but it was NOT a genuine Nintendo product as it claimed to be in the item description. So, if you want only genuine Nintendo, beware."
3,Nintendo DS Lite AC adapter,"The charger seems to work fine so far, but I did think I was buying an original replacement charger and not a third party one. I'm sure it will be fine, but I honestly would have paid a few dollars more to have one backed by Nintendo in the event there are any issues. The picture for the product shouldn't include a photo of the original product since that's misleading."
3,I't not a new one!,"I received this product in an used condition.I'm a bit disappointed , but it works for me so it's ok."
2,Incorrect item sent,I ordered 2 each 2 oz. Black Cohosh. I received one correct item and one incorrect item. I'm now trying to have them pick up the incorrect item and ship the correct one. They took a message and 'someone' will be getting back to me in three days. Not as good an experinece as the first supplier I used through Amazon.
1,Very pretty until you use them,"Bought these online. First mistake was not paying attention to the size of the dinner plate. Huge. My bad. But what I couldn't know ahead of time was how badly they would mark every time silverware touches the plate/bowl. I called Pfaltzgraff after using the dishes for a couple weeks. They said ""that happens with some silverware"" and that I should use their cleaner. I did. It worked. Then I tried different silverware. Same story.The dishes are so bad I don't use them if we are having company. I can't get all the marks off anymore. Using the cleaner takes time. The dishes have to be almost clean before applying the cleanser. Then wait @ an hour for the cleaner to dry. Then wash. I emailed Pfaltzgraff to see if they would help. They offered to give me 20% off new dishes. As if I'm ever going to buy more of thier product! When I got them my mom said ""they won't last very long"". Guess she really is right all the time."
3,Picture looks better,The picture looks better than real life. The plates and bowls are heavy ceramic but for the price of it I can't compalin. Overall it is a very pretty set of plates.
3,Vita and Harold's loves,"A fascinating insight into the loves and lusts of Vita Sackville-West and Harold Nicolson. One will always question how the marriage stayed together as each partner went off to do their own ""thing"" with same-sex partners. A lesson in underlying love I guess???"
4,Shining Light on Another Place and Time,"This book shows how a marriage can and is a legal arrangement as well as an emotional one. From inside the story, the author describes how his parents built a life and marriage together that protected the whole family legally, while allowing both partners to express themselves sexually in outside relationship, mostly of the same sex variety. This was so much more necessary in an earlier time than it is now. About the only thing we can liken it to in contemporary society is the marital arrangement between parties that allows one of the parties to immigrate to another country.Higher Love (Lavender Line) (Lavender Line)"
5,Great book.,"This books gives insight to Vita Sackville's marriage to Harold Nicolson, a man who appears to be infinitely kinder and less controlling than Virginia Woolf's husband Leonard Woolf."
1,Does not work as Dual Link DVI,"Warning, The Dual Link DVI cables from MarginMart did not work. They only worked in single link mode. In Dual Link mode they will drop half of the pixels, unlike true Dual Link DVI cables. The connectors match the Dual Link appearance but they are fake."
1,Won't Function at 2560x1600 Resolution,"It would not allow my 30"" DoubleSight monitor to show 2560x1600 resolution. As soon as I swapped to another cable by another company, the monitor displayed 2560x1600 perfectly."
5,Good Cable,"This is a solid cable, it feels hefty, the monitor and supported resolutions are easily detected. The gold ends are a nice touch. Video quality is as good as the shorter manufacturers cables I replaced with this."
3,Not really dual link,"Bought this cable to run my new monitor at 2560 x 1440 native resolution. Since text was illegible above 1600 resolution, I had to buy the Tripp Lite cable to actually run 2560 x 1440. The Cables To Go cable was fine up to 1600 and the price was cheap so three stars."
5,Awesome,Great product Allows me to move my computer out without unhooking the monitors .....now I have to type some BS to make the button appear
3,Slightly damaged and bulky,"Pros:PriceWorksLongCons:Very bulky. Larger than your average DVI cable.Arrived with slight damage. The DVI connection was bent just enough that it couldn't be plugged in. I was able to bend it back enough to make it fit. None the less, the item arrived damaged.Ended up not being able to use it after all due to poor placement of the DVI connection on the back of my monitor. No fault of the cable I ordered."
1,Not Dual Link - no 2560x1440,"Maybe I got a defective cable. Cables appear to be dual link with 24 pins. But does not support 2560*1440 on my system. I use a laptop and have to push the signal with an Accell Dual Link Adapter to get 2560*1440 resolution. My other cables work fine, these do not. Picture is very distorted as if single link.Accell UltraAV B087B-002B DisplayPort/DVI-D Dual-Link Adapter (Black)Will try to exchange cables."
5,10 feet DVI Male/Male cable,I purchased this via Amazon from BestDeal77 since the price was really great (apprx $6) and the shipping cost was only around $3. This is amazing since they shipped it from China. This meant it took about a month to get to me but it was worth the wait. It is excellent quality and works fine. This is the second item I have purchased that shipped from China and have no regrets.
1,Product is not as described.,"I don't understand the reason they don't allow me to post the review, So I'll just make it simple. The cable is not as described. It's shorter than 10 feet which makes my setup failed."
1,This is a phony - NOT DUAL LINK,"The cable appears to be dual link DVI but is actually single link, does not work _at all_ for my 2560x1440 monitor.Extremely disappointed."
1,Not a dual-link cable,"Don't waste your money on this cable! It is not a dual-link cable, and does not work at all with a dual link video card and monitor. I didn't get a chance to try it, until after the return deadline had expired, and it's not worth paying to return it. Beware!"
1,Not really a Dual Link cable,"I wanted a longer cable for my 2560x1440 monitor and $10 seemed like a reasonable price for a Dual link cable. When the cable arrived, I couldn't get it to work with my monitor and GTX 670 GPU. I got out the ohm meter and found that a number of pins aren't actually connected to the other end of the cable.Either the cable was bad, or the pins were designed to make you think it was a Dual link cable even when it's not. The return is in the mail, and I've ordered a 15 foot cable from another seller."
2,Trouble with Dual Link D-DVI,"I bought two of these cables to allow for the height of a standing desk. Worked great for 2x 22"" single-link D-DVI monitors for a few months.I just updated to a dual-link-required 2560x1440 monitor and neither cable works. The dual-link D-DVI cable that came with the monitor works fine. I'm not sure if it's a length thing or if the manufacturer is just selling broken dual-link cables, but if you're specifically looking for dual-link D-DVI, beware."
3,"Good cable when it worked, failed under light use","This is a pretty standard cable. It did the job just fine for about two years, but recently it's begun showing only one of the color channels at a time (red, green or blue) unless it's positioned just right. It's only seen light use; the only stress it's had is being disconnected a few times when I've needed to move my desktop. This is less that I'd expect from a cable at this price.Unlike some other reviewers', mine is genuine dual-link. I'd recommend a shorter length unless 10' is necessary, however, as the cable is quite thick and stiff and does not easily coil and tuck away in a tidy manner."
1,As others said not dual link,"It's a cable, I thought what possibly could be difficult about it so I didn't bother reading reviews just snagged 4 of them. Damn me, I forgot to take into account that the manufacturer might be a lying bastard. The cables don't work in dual link, only single link as another reviewer noticed."
1,FAKE DVI-D! These are NOT dual link cables! DO NOT BUY!!!,"I am irritated beyond words!These cables ARE NOT DUAL LINK DVI at all - they DO NOT SUPPORT 2560x1600 resolution. The cables themselves are not even marked as DVI. This company obviously just packages up whatever they want, puts a fake label on it and ships it off hoping you are none the wiser. NEVER EVER BUYING A CABLES UNLIMITED PRODUCT AGAIN.I now have to take half a day and drive 128km to ship this garbage back to them. That's on top of the 128km I drop to pickup the package. The gas is going to cost me more than the refund for this cheap junk.Doesn't Amazon police their suppliers at all??????"
4,smokey32,Great price. This was exactly what I was looking for. Came as described by the seller and was early. Would recommend this to anyone looking to extend their cables on their computers.
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought three of these cables and none of them is a true dual-link cable. I guess my first clue should have been the writing on the cable sheath itself which says ""HDMI CABLE"", not ""Dual Link"".Worst buying experience ever on Amazon - DO NOT BUY THESE CABLES - RUN AWAY."
1,Not a Dual Link Cable,"While this cable has the correct pin outs for a Dual Link cable, it will not transmit the signal correctly. It will correctly transmit 1920x1080@60Hz. It will not not transfer 1920x1080@120Hz as DVI Dual Link should. For most people this would be fine, but why would you pay for the dual link when all you need is single link. I had purchased two cables, both exhibited this behavior, so I know it is not a single defective cable."
4,Basic DVID cable,"This basic DVID cable came in a plastic bag and was what it was. Good deal, no problems."
5,Good Product over priced shipping...,Standard Amazon cheat. Good low price product over priced shipping. I bought four of these cables and they changed me $5.95 each to ship.
5,Pop at its finest,"These lads from Southern California have a precious gift of writing extremely joyful and melodic pop music with a refreshing charm unseen in today's music. If you're looking for an entertaining listen, pick this puppy up and let it take you for a ride! Expect big things from Arlo in the years to come and by all means, check them out if they come to town."
5,Great system. In use for ~6 years,"I have two IQAir units and have had them running constantly for ~6 years. There has never been a problem with them. Although these systems are expensive, other systems that I have tried are no match. This is a very high quality system, built for the long-haul.I have allergies and have one here in my office and one in the bedroom. The filters seem to help reduce the allergy symtoms quite a bit. I keep them running on a low speed all of the time and they are quiet enough that we hardly notice them; at the lowest speed, I think they work like white-noise for canceling other noises (refrigerator, for example) - an unexpected benefit.This Pre-filter helps increase the longevity of the HEPA filter and is less than half the cost. The IQAir units let you know when it is time to change the filters and even provide a warning in advance.Amazon's prices for all of the IQAir filters seem to be as low as any price."
5,Filter works well,Filter works well. Easy to install. Ordered the filter when light came on and it was shipped the next day.
5,Great for allergies,"We've been using the IQAir Purifier for years, and we just keep buying the filters as needed."
4,IQAir PreMax Pre-Filter,I give 4 stars because I feel the price point on this product is still very high. I have had my IQAir unit for a number of years and I the only complaint I have is the price of the replacement filters.
5,It's a filter,"It's a filter, and it fits. Not very exciting but nothing wrong with it. Kind of spendy, but so was the unit itself."
5,Best invention ever!,"This flawlessly keeps my kids out of the fridge. They used to leave the door open all night long every other night, but now they can't even open the door. It also keeps my wife and I out too. We usually try to pull the door first, then remember we need to push the clip to open. The sticky pad on the latch is some kind of super strength glue. It doesn't come off! I actually broke the fridge door handle when I went to open it one day."
1,Does not stick,"Attached item to the fridge per instructions. The next morning, my almost-2-year-old ripped it off. We are now using a much less expensive fridge lock that works like it should. Alas, this failed lock hasn't gone completely to waste - we've repurposed it by sticking the slider vertically to the cabinet to hang up bibs."
2,Worked well for 1 month,My 3 year old was constantly taking things out of the refrigerator. I finally got tired of cleaning broken eggs up off the floor and his bed. I found this product in a google search. It worked great for the first month but now it will not stick to the refrigerator. Good product idea but need to figure out how to keep it sticky longer.
5,AWESOME,"This fridge lock is FANTASTIC. Locks automatically, is a breeze to open (opens extremely easily with one hand), and COMPLETELY keeps my 23 month old out of the refrigerator. Can't believe how much easier it has made my life!! Awesome product, recommend immensely. (="
5,Fridge Lock,I absolutely love love this product. I was so glad when we got it because my two year old thought it was great to get into it anytime and take what he wanted. I highly recommend it.
1,cheap stuff and very bad customer service product not recommende at all,this product fell off the refrigerator soon after it was put on i had a hard time communicating with the seller for refund ultimately Amazon refunded me the product value using A-Z guarantee. The seller was very reluctant to speak or credit me back the money.
3,Okay for a short time,"This product worked really well for the first few weeks. My 1 1/2 yr old son was CONSTANTLY opening our bottom freezer door, so this stopped him for a couple weeks. once he realized what was preventing him from opening it, he started yanking on the handle (which attaches with a strong tape)and eventually managed to take it off completely. So much for that."
1,Had high hopes,"I had high hopes that this product would keep my 2 year old out of the fridge, but it wasn't even on for 30 minutes before she pulled it right off of the fridge. So sad that this product was cheap and unreliable."
1,CRUMMY cheap product! does not HOLD,"I wish I would've read the reviews ... the glue does NOT stick ... the clip pops off EVERY TIME.I purchased this not to keep kids out, but to ensure my freezer (in garage) clicks closed -- after losing hundreds of dollars in meat cuz it didn't close all the way, I thought this product would be helpful - even just to hear an audible click -- but if you forget it's there and pull .. SNAPPO ... the glue on the clip part (on door) pops RIGHT off ... like, zero effort. FAIL.waste of money :("
2,Lasted One Month,"Under standard use and conditions, this lock cracked after one month. Worked well up until then. Be careful when installing, you have to line the two pieces up just so to make it work."
1,don't bother,"This product is an absolute piece of worthless garbage. Wasted time and extra money buying different types of glue to try to get the (bigger) ""latch"" half of the piece to stick to the fridge."
2,Peels off easily,"The problem with this lock is that it doesn't have a hinge, so every time you open the fridge door, you apply pressure against the adhesive side that is glued to the side of the fridge. After a a few uses, it peels off and the adhesive is no longer effective. Its a good idea that addresses a real need but the design needs refinement. At the very least, they need to use a better quality glue that withstands the wear."
3,Had to reinforce with superglue.,"This product lasted minutes with its own adhesive. I superglued that sucker on, though, and it's been holding solid for a week now."
2,Not for surfaces that are not smooth,I placed the unit on a new refrigerator with a slightly dimpled suface. Of course it could not seal on this kind of surface so was always coming loose. I think it would be great on a better surface
2,My tiny 2 year old girl broke it within 2 weeks,"This is the second fridge lock I have tried, and it was as disappointing as the other one. First, it was not easy to place the two pieces in just the right position in order to work properly. Then as we used it, the plastic latch started sticking out, requiring us to push it back into place each time we closed it. Within 2 weeks, my teeny tiny 2 year old daughter managed to yank the door open so hard that the plastic latch snapped on the bottom; within a few days, my 6 year old son accidentally finished the job. So now it's back to squawking at the kids to stop stealing cheese and blueberries."
1,The glue on these suck!,"I bought a couple of these and over time have used every last one. My son is much larger than a normal 3 year old, but he has pried the part that attaches to the door off every time. Maybe my son just has super strength, but these never lasted more than a week or 2 each."
3,"Good Idea, Needs Better Sealing Product",I bought this because my 2 year old son kept opening up my refrigerator. It went on perfectly and worked good for the first day. He learned how to unlatch it after the second day and took about 1 1/2 weeks before he decided to swing the door open hard enough to break it from the door. I don't totally blame it on the plastic durability but more so the sticky tape that is supposed to hold it in place on your refrigerator door.
3,Depends on how old youre trying to keep out,"I have a 2 and 4 year old, it served its purpose for the 2 year old but nearly a week after it had been installed my 4 year old had it snapped off. Its plastic and seemed to be durable, but if you have an older child fair warning, its break able!"
1,worthless,"save your money. The minute I attached this fridge guard to my refrigerator, the plastic fell off the adhesive strap and onto the floor. It did not even last one minute."
3,"Holds when closed, but not easy to close",Once closed this keeps the fridge closed. It does not however latch on it's own. The door has to be pushed to engage the latch or it pops open again.
2,Broke in two weeks,"Terrible product, didn't work, and broke within two weeks not worth the money....seller was great though....so I'll give it two stars"
3,Ref. Guard,"It took two weeks before the unit was detached from the refrigerator, maybe gluing it back would help! i didn't try that yet, but hey you pay 5 dollars thats what you gonna get!"
2,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this product to stop my two-year-old twins from helping themselves to everything in the fridge. It worked as stated for about a week. The week it worked was wonderful, but after about 7 days, the latch part fell off the fridge. I could stick it back on about three or four times, but after a few days, it didn't work at all. Save your money and put it towards a fridge guard that will work!"
2,"Works great, but could be less flimsy","It works great, unfortunately both the ones we've bought have lasted 3 months before breaking off. Hoping to find something more durable now, although I guess it's ok for the price."
4,"Extrememly effective, though it broke after 4 months","Although this product broke on me after four months (it snapped in half) I liked it enough that I ordered another one.PROS:Never failed to stop a child from entering the fridge (after the first week he rarely tried to open it, though he still tries)Clear (many visitors didn't notice it was there, until the door wouldn't open)Easy to use (one-handed open; no hands needed to relock)CONS:Price (it's a little high, even when shipping is accounted for)Broke after 4 months (as stated, it snapped in half...probably from normal stresses on the polymer; it could probably be fabricated from a more pliant material and be as effective)Again, though, I was happy enough with it to buy another."
5,"Used many locks, this one is great","I used the Safety 1st fridge lock for years so when we moved I needed a new lock. 1st lock broke within a day by 4 yr old, replacement lock broke in an hr. I thought I was going to have to tie fridge shut but found this. I was skeptical but figured i would give it a shot. Its PERFECT!!! I have the lock at the top of the fridge (i have a side by side fridge/freezer) and its perfect!"
1,Cheaply Made,This worked great while it lasted. My 2 year old was able to break in a matter of days. We've bought 3 of them now but they don't last long. Disappointed.
2,works but its unsticking already,"this worked great at first. Then my 2 year old just ripped the arm off, so i guess its not strong enough. Now we put it back on but its half off"
1,Piece of junk,"This refrigerator lock is a piece of junk. I would have returned it to the seller, except it's not worth the postage or the time I would have to spend at the post office. I followed the instructions for attaching the lock to my refrigerator EXPLICITLY, and every time I opened the refrigerator door, the damn thing snapped off. TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE product. I am thoroughly DISSATISFIED."
4,Needs better instructions,"The fridge guard seems to work well after some trial and error. The problem is that the instructions aren't very clear. If you install the clip as shown in the picture, when you close the door, the latch doesn't catch but rather puts undo stress on the adhesive. Eventually the catch adhesive gives and the product is useless. To shut the door, you really have to push on the door to compress the gasket around the door. Same thing to open the fridge door, need to first push in to compress the gasket, then pull back on the catch and then open door. Not very useful this way.What you got to do, is attach the catch so it step out forward a bit than shown. That way, when you close the door it will snap in and latch. When pulling on the door handle, you can still open the door a tiny bit but you can't get in the fridge and the catch and adhesive aren't stressed.Good product once you figure that out and needs better mounting instructions."
5,I was skeptical...,I have a two year old grandson that thinks he is 'the boss' of the refridgerator. We were getting frustrated with trying to keep him out of it. When I saw this product I was skeptical that it would work. I wasn't sure that it would adhere well enough but in my desperation I ordered it anyway and am I ever glad I did. It has worked great and has given us all more peace in the house! I recommend it to anyone that is seeking out some peace of mind!
1,Don't waste your money,"This looks different than it is, it just slides over the other piece. The reason I got it was because I thought it was a lock as it appears to keep kids out of the refrigerator. Even my 1 yr. old nephew was able to figure out how to open it and it left sticky residue on my fridge that I can't get off. I tried goo gone and super glue remover, acetone and scrubbing it-nothing works. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and am upset that I spent money on 2 of them."
5,WONDERFUL! EXCELLENT! WORTH EVERY PENNY! I am in love with this lock!,"This lock is AMAZING! My daughter loves the fridge. You can't keep her out. We had to...to save the eggs. lol. I was very discouraged to buy a lock because a lot of them are crap and break and the rest are just too!! hard to open and need more than 1 hand.This lock is wonderful. It took a whole 30 seconds to put on the fridge. I use the same hand to unlock the fridge while opening it and my daughter can't budge it. We put it all the way at the top so she won't be able to reach it for a while, too. This lock is the #1 I have ever owned or seen. I 100% recommend this fridge lock for any strength kids and no matter how clever they may be."
3,Exploitation Films from the 30ties to the 60ties,"Interesting Work about Exploitation Films vom 1930 to 1965. The Book treats mainly older and very old ""Educational-films"" like ""Sex Maniac"", ""Cocaine"" ""Marihuana"", ""Delinquent Daughters"" .... Unfortunately the ""Nudies""-Exploitations films of the 70ties or the ""Blackploitation""-Films (Sweet Sweetback'S Baadassss Song)are not covered at all."
2,Made by Hoya?,"Given that most Quantaray (Ritz Camera's store brand) lenses are made by Sigma, I was surprised to read that this 19-35mm is made by Hoya. I went down to my local Ritz store and asked them about it. As usual, the clerks there couldn't answer my question.If this is indeed a Hoya lens, then it's probably best to stay away from it. Hoya is known for making dirt-cheap, low-quality stuff. This is not to say this lens is total trash, and if you have a cheap Nikon SLR and just want a relatively inexpensive wideangle lens, this may still work for you -- although $200 is a lot of money in my book. I'm staying away from this one. I can get a Tamron for just a little more but its quality is many times superior."
1,Don't buy this book.,"I was very disappointed with this wreath book. It was nothing but an old book with a new cover. False advertising as I thought the wreath designs would resemble the cover. Not so. Just goes to show the old saying ""Never judge a book by its cover is true!"""
2,Either I'm using it wrong...,Or it doesn't work.I bought this so I could stop using my grubby hands on my face.I gave up though because I couldn't figure it out.
1,Tourture device,"This product is perfect if you have tourture in mind. Otherwise, keep shopping and find something different. All this product does is cause pain to the point of streaming tears. Seriously, this was designed by a sociopath or masochist. One of the worst inventions ever!"
2,Good for the big stuff.,I can't see how this could be used for a blackhead unless the blackhead was huge. It works well on big whiteheads though.
4,Tweezed,Seems pretty well made. A little too large for what it's made for.It looks like it will last a long time.
2,hummm,I haven't been abele to do anything with this. I'm better off using finger nails. I'm afraid it sounded and looked more useful then it is.
1,SENT ME TO THE HOSPITAL FOR TWO DAYS!!! CHEAP METAL,"THIS IS NOT A STAINLESS STEEL METAL. MY FACE SWELLED SO BAD THAT I HAD TO GO TO ER AND THEN STAY THE NIGHT!!!! I HAD NO IDEA THAT I HAD SKIN ALLERGIES TO THIS CERTAIN METAL. I HAVE NEVER HAD A REACTION BEFORE, THE SIDE OF THE EXTRACTOR SAYS STAINLESS INDIA, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!???"
2,Just okay,I was excited about this when I ordered it but the results were less than impressive.I feel like if you have large pores it would work great (worked great on my husband *don't tell him I said that*) but if you have small pores I hate to say it but fingernails work better.The tool is just too big to be used for small pores or delicate areas of the face.
3,Good but Avon's works better.,"I have two Tweezerman blackhead removers, a square handle and a rounded one. Both work adequately on larger blackheads but for smaller ones the loop's metal is just too thick. I have a $5 tool from Avon (Canada) that is completely flat, including the loop. This makes it MUCH easier to extract even the smallest blackheads. Tweezerman can't be beat when it comes to tweezers but for blackhead extraction (my terrible skin has made me a pro, unfortunately), Avon has the better remover."
3,Not as good as the Revlon version,"This tool works and is well made, but it has a really wide head on one end that is angled in such as way that you have to hold the tool perpendicular to your face.I much perfer the Revlon, as it is angled better and had a tighter loop to all for more targetted use."
3,A child's view of National Forests in the pre-Smokey bear days,"Written for about 1st-2nd grade level readers, and set in the pre-Smokey Bear era in a National Forest, this could be an interesting book for today's kids -- with a bit of interpretation. Yes, in 1948, a child might very well have saddled up the donkey and ridden up to the fire lookout. And, yes, the ranger was the man and the one baking the cookies was the woman... that needs a little interpretation, too. Great nostalgia for outdoorsy and National Forest types, too."
2,NOT original recordings,"it is hard to find original recordings for some artists. I fear that Jerry wallace is 1 of them. I have seen it done, and fear that may have happened with Jerry Wallace, after a length of time, sometimes the owner of the masters will erase the master, sometimes without making a new master from the original master. well, we won't be likely to hear the original 60's sound of jerry wallace. the newer releases are not real bad, but they are definitly not the original. I do have to wonder if this is Jerry Wallace, on the newer releases of his hits. his voice has realy changed, and I'm not sure that eEQ changes are to blame."
1,Not a gentle introduction,"If you are not a statistician, don't think for a moment that you are going to buy this book and be able to actually do anything about missing data. It is largely theoretical and is very complicated. It really is false advertising to call this a gentle introduction. I must have read the section on the difference between data that is missing at random, missing completely at random, and missing not at random 10 times and I still don't fully understand it. The book takes a useful approach in that it approaches missing data by trying to understand why it is missing instead of just throwing a solution at it, but that is where the usefulness ended for me."
4,"Just Tapes, No Books","Just tapes, no books, bit misleading on the cover as you think you're getting books to read along with the tapes but you're not, just the audio stories only. Still, great stories!"
1,"Times, and quality, have changed!","Mom had one pair of these identical pajamas that we bought her fifteen years ago. Now that she is 94 and in bed much of the time, we wanted her to have the same comfortable pajamas. We bought her five pair so she would wash them only once a week. Very thin fabric and raveling seams make it hard to believe that these five pair will last ONE year. Save your money! The brand counts for nothing."
2,Grandma style,"I purchased this for my middle-aged wife and she very kindly informed me that it just wasn't her style... it is more of a style fit for a grandmother! She really likes pink... hot pink... but this is ""pepto-bismol"" pink. Oops... hard to tell online."
1,Very Nice,Material is extremely comfortable. Length is not too long for a petite woman. Color is beautiful and flattering. Fits well in all areas. Rubber around waistband should have been covered by material for more comfort.
2,too skimpy,"top fits fine, but pajama pants are way too skimpy to be size 1X - I am used to Vanity Fair products being well made, would have wanted to know that product was cut on the small side."
1,Wrong measurement.,"I would say, unless you are long-legged, don't order medium or small sizes of this pajama; unless you don't mind cutting off and re-hemming the pants part. Had the pants not been much too long, I would certainly have kept this Vanity Fair pajama."
4,Just as expected.,"Purchased for my 94 year old mother, who has worn these for probably 40 years.Am so glad I can order them because I cannot find them in the stores."
2,Vanity Fair Women's PJs,"I assumed this pajama would be the same quality as the many I have purchased over the years. However, while the fit is still right, the quality of the fabric is not the same as previously manufactured. For the price, I was disappointed. If I had to pay this price, the quality should have been the same or better than what was available before. I should mention the price was almost double what these pjs cost a few years ago."
5,Great Product,"I love these pajamas.True to size and very comfortable.They were shipped promptly, with hangers!I would definitely do business again!"
4,Soft,"I love these pajama's so much I have three pair. Living in Florida and being over 60 I don't like heavy, long sleeve sleepwear. These fit the bill perfectly. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because one pair the hem came out and I've only had them a month. Other than that they are great....going to order the other colors I don't have."
1,Not worth ther money,Pj's are very think and you can see thought them. Have to wear socks and gloves to protect the material for nicks. Will not buy vanity fair again and will return the pair I bought.
1,Poor Sizing,"The sizing is not even close. ordered as a last minute gift for Christmas, and was unable to to give, as was not even close to a 1x!!"
3,Vanity Fair womens short sleeve pajama,Nothing fabulous about these pajamas but very functional. Washes well and doesn't wrinkle. They are nice practical pajama set to travel with as they don't wrinkle.
4,Love Vanity Fair,"I have worn Vanity Fair lingerie for years so I knew this would be a good buy. It is so pretty and comfortable and washes like a dream, and lasts for years. The only complaint I have with the PJs is they are too long and needed hemmed. The company should make them in Women`s petite sizes."
3,"nice, but there's quality control problems","I bought this in pink, blue, and black.The fabric on the pink champagne pj's was very nice--light, soft, and drapy. The blue and black seemed to be a slightly different and inferior fabric. It didn't come in petite, so the pants are too long, but they can be cut--they roll up, so hemming is not needed. It's a good value for the price -- the covered buttons are a nice touch. BUT the buttons on the pink one wouldn't stay closed; it had to be sewn. The blue one was fine. The black pants were odd--one leg was fine. The other leg was made of a piece of fabric completely covered on both sides with pulled threads and sticky white bits of something."
2,"Material is sheer, nothing like I expected from Vanity Fair","I chose 2 stars because of the poor quality fabric. Not only was it too sheer, when held to the light the fabric had variations in the quality."
1,Not worth the price,The material was so thin and see-through and snags on everything. It reminds me of cheap Halloween costumes. I'm very disappointed with them.
5,My favorite pj's.,"I love my Vanity Fair Pajamas. They are pretty, fit well, very comfortable, and wash well. I would definitely purchase more of them."
2,Too thin,"The material is much thinner than I thought it would be. I ordered a pair in rose and black. The rose is see through, but the black is okay. You can tell if you look closely at the images of the lighter colors that you'll be able to see through them."
5,Excellent pj's,I bought these pj's (3 pairs) for my 93 year old great aunt...she loves them and these were a great price. They are cool and very comfortable and wash/dry easily.
3,Silky PJ's,"Has the nylon changed over the years or is it me? These pj's are okay, but not as heavy as they once were. They ""catch"" on my feet whenever I put them on; still better than thick cotton though."
5,Vanity Fair Pajamas,"My mother has been wearing this pajama for years, but you can't find them sometimes. Glad to know I can get them online now."
5,EXCELLENT QUALITY AND SERVICE!!,"This product is hard to fine, but Vanity Fair still provides them and with excellent quality. The shipping service was excellent. It made a wonderful Christmas gift for my 95 year old mother."
2,Really thin and cheap looking,"I was very disappointed in these - the black is almost sheer and the fabric is so thin that it's impossible to get rid of the static cling! The pictures made it look more satiny, but it's so thin I wouldn't even call it that!"
3,"lightweight, comfortable but gaping top :(",Love the lightweight comfort of these pajamas but am only going to give three stars because if I am around the family I have to wear a sweater as the roomy top has too much space between buttons so it gaps....a lot. an extra button would have solved the problem. There are around 5 and one half inches between each button. Too bad. Great sleeping pj's though
5,Jammies,"I love these PJ's. I bought a pair at Pennys but they only had one medium and one color. I wanted more. Hense, Amazon. I received them quickly and exactly what I ordered. One hem did come out in the washer but no big deal. A needle and thread and walla. If you want sleeping comfort, go for these. They are not hot in the summer either, which is a big plus when you are an ""older woman"".Thanks Amazon"
5,Vanity Fair Colortura Pajamas,"These pajamas are very comfortable, soft and come in lots of colors. They are softer than other nylon pajamas. These pajamas are warm when it is a little cool out, but not hot. Wish Vanity Fair still made the Colortura robe in more colors."
3,Nice but Thin,"Bought these for my wife for Christmas. Thought she'd love them since she does not like flannel as they are too hot! The only problem with these pajamas is that the material is thin and she felt that you could ""slightly"" see through them (I couldn't tell that they showed anything). As you can tell my wife is modest."
4,Nice pajama set,"The set is light and comfortable. It is not tight and very soft. I recommend it. If my feet are dry, they tend to ""drag"" on the pants as I put them on. I am planning on buying a set for my mother for Christmas."
1,Where have the quality brands gone?,"My 80+ mother wanted new pajamas so I told her I would locate and order for her, which I did. She has worn Vanity Fair pajamas just like the ones I ordered so, although I did see some reviews complaining about current quality of the pajamas, I ordered without too much question. She has washed and worn them a few times and they are horrible! There are so many strings that appear after each washing that she says there may be nothing but strings soon. I would definitely not recommend these pajamas. Not sure what has happened, because Vanity Fair used to offer great quality."
5,PJ.,"BEEN LLOOKING FOR THESE FOE A LONG TIME FOR MY WIFE, AND I FINELY FOUND THEM SHE LOVE THEM. DOUG"
5,"Vanity Fair Women's Colortura Short Sleeve Pajama , Victory Violet , 2X","I loved this product, it fits so well and feels great against my skin. The color is very bright and wonderful. I will recommend this product to anybody."
1,Don't waste your money!,"These pajamas are horrible! Paper thin with huge gaps between the buttons. I'm usually happy with my online purchases but not this time! I've kept them only because I don't want to pay shipping to send them back. But do not waste your money on these "" tissue paper"" like PJ's!"
3,Went Downhill,My Aunt has been wearing these p.j.'s for years. The fabric quality has gone downhill. Very flimsy and thin. Love the color though.
4,"If you like fighting, buy it, simple as that!!","This was a good fight movie if you are into this sort of stuff. It was fighting from beginning to end, nonstop. There was maybe 15 seconds or so between fights. The fight at the end was tight!! The choreography wasn't the greatest I've seen, but it got better as the movie went along and was a lot better than a lot of the crap out there. If you are looking for a movie w/ a plot, don't buy it. All movies don't have to have a plot. If you want a plot, go rent a chick flick you panzies."
5,Amazing!!!!,"I have been searching Amazon for movies to watch and have always passed on choosing this movie because of the reviews. My only regret is that I had not watched it sooner. The action is amazing. I loved it! I am a Kung Fu fan and for me, this is one to own. Sometimes you just have to watch the movie and make up your own mind."
1,Re-edit of a TV series,"This is actually a re-editing of a 1980 TV series, hence why the plot is thin and it feels like it was spliced together from disparate parts. Apparently Chinese distributors think that Western audiences can't handle full-length movies or entire TV series and that we only watch Kung Fu movies for the Kung Fu as they do this to a lot of movies and TV series that they release as movies. On that basis alone, I give it a 1 star rating and advise you to seek out the original."
2,disappointing,"I am a big fan of kung-fu movies so when I saw this I had to watch it. I figured it would be good since it is new. Also it has Yuen Biao in it who I loved in the Once Upon a Time in China series. After watching the movie which I could barely do, I was disappointed. This is one of the worst kung fu movies I have seen and any fan of kung fu movies knows there are a ton of bad ones. I prefer bad '70s kung fu movies to this. It seems to have taken little parts and scenes from a lot of movies to make this one. I thought the picture quality wasn't that good, the plot wasn't original, and the fight scenes were done poorly. It seems as if a high school drama class was in charge of producing the movie. If you have really low expectations than it may be okay but when I see Yuen Biao in a movie I expect it to not be horrible. I hope you like it more than I did."
1,Worst Kung-Fu movie ever,"I should have read the reviews before buying this horrendous movie. The kung-fu scenes are the worst pruduction I had ever seen. And, to make things worse (if that could be possible), there is no reasonable plot; the movie is just a quilt of badly acted fights. Maybe if you could watch the movie in Chinese you might have lines of more than three to four words, but because I don't speak Chinese I have no way to tell you; however, watching it in English might give you the pleasure to enjoy lines of at the most two words. The dialogs, in English, reminded me of some gutural dialogs in movies about prehistoric people casted in the early 70s."
3,It is not so a bad movie after all...,"You can never believe what people say in the review. You must keep an open mind.The plot of the movie is an emperor wanted the best of the Kung-Fu master to train his troops. He presented a series of test to make sure the Kung-Fu master is the best. When he gets to talk to the emperor, he declined to train his troops because it is against his buddhist teaching and beliefs.At the end, the emperor orders to destroy the Shaolin monastery. The remaining Shaolin monks went to release the Kung-Fu master held prisoner at the fortress.The Kung Fu master exhibits great Kung Fu skills. I will rate the movie 3 or more stars."
1,Kung fu Master,This movie was simply terrible! It seems as though it was part of a series. Very Choppy and the plot was inconsistent. One of the worst purchases I've ever made!
5,big bang theory 1-3,Absolutely a wonderful purchase. My daughter received these for Christmas and watched all three seasons during her Christmas break from school--begging to get the next season.
5,BIG Bang Theory,these shows are so very funny.cant get enough.I have weird working hours and cant see the show;so now I can watch when I am home.these boys are so funny.and I know a Sheldon;which makes it better for me.
5,Big Bang Theory is Hilarious,This is my favorite comedy series. The cast is awesome and the price for the first 3 years as a set was good. I also purchased the 4th year DVD.
2,Big Bang Theory Seasons 1-3,This is the best show on tv...and with 3 seasons full of laughs there is always plenty to watch....a very good investment if you are a fan & if you don't know the show....you should!
1,Eco-Professional dive Watch ???,"Purchased this watch about two months ago,and it is already having problems.The 300m water resistants didnt make it to 80ft and the time adjusting pin is now broken. I would not recommend this product."
1,lamentablemente....amazon me fallo por primera vez,"compre el proucto, debian enviarmelo a una casilla en miami...llego la caja vacia...les pido me devuelvan el dinero de la compra y me salen con la necesidad de poner papelito de refund....si ellos fallan...deben ellos mismos verificar y correr con los gastos...sin vueltas..."
3,"Good, but a bit screwy","I've had this watch for a little under two years, I paid $145. Overall it has kept good time, and it has never run out of juice. I find the date display small and I have to constantly change it each month, I never do and the date is always wrong. I have dove with the watch several times and it has usually preformed well up 'til now. On my last dive I swear I had the screw lock locked and water got in at a depth of only 40ft. I sent to citizen for repair (it is still under warrenty) and they want almost $100 to fix it and were not very friendly. Still debating on whether to pay them or just buy in something different."
1,Citizen Horrible Watch Warranty,"I bought this watch for my husband to replace is old dive watch. The Eco-Drive is what caught my attention, if you have to change a battery in a dive watch it has to be sent out and resealed...for the cost, you may as well just throw it out.While my husband loved the watch; after less than a year when he went to change the time for Standard Daylight savings time; the stem and crown fell out. So, we sent the watch back to Citizen and even though they have a 5 year warranty refused to cover it under warranty. The repair cost was $60. What a rip off, my husband pushed back at Citizen but they basically told him they would not cover it. EVEN THOUGH THEIR WEB SITE says the warranty COVERS THE STEM. I read another review that had the same issue; shame on you Citizen!I will never buy another Citizen product, if they won't stand by their products any better than that .. I will spend my money on other brands."
5,great watch and great customer service!!,"love this watch. don't like digital, but i am in the ocean all the time and work in the rain. had trouble with analogs in the water, but not this watch. one day though, i left the knob loose and took a shower. water got in the case. i sent it to citizen and they sent me a brand new watch soon after. i was really won over by the customer service. i am a customer for life now!"
4,Works great,"I've previously owned an Aqualand that I needed to replace but no longer needed the features since buying a dive computer. The watch keeps very good time and I've had no issues with it under water. My main concern was the fact that I have a smaller wrist and my Aqualand was a reduced sized Analog and I wanted the same size, but that version of the Aqualand isn't available anymore. The size works great for me, it's not a bulky instrument. JC Penny gets full pop for these guys while Amazon had them at 50% off."
4,Citizen Watch,"Watch band feels rough and sometimes uncomfortable. Other than that slight problem the watch is great! I would buy another one, the Eco-drive is great"
