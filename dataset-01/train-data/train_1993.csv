4,The Power of B-days Stars & #s,"This book is the best book on birthday traits I have ever read, far more accurate than the Language of Birthdays (though that book isn't bad). I couldn't believe how on point it was about everyone, and I do mean everyone, I showed it to. I always look up the b-days of people after I've gotten to know them, just to see how accurate it is, and it has not been wrong so far. Only negative is that it's not always right about the love & relationships/fatal attractions/soul mates, etc. Still, it's a book worth every penny."
1,Wow! What a piece of junk!,"This worked great for a few uses. It even crushed ice effectively and I liked the pulse function. I agree with someone else that the collar at the base is lame and difficult to deal with.Then the dial stopped working. Wouldn't turn right of the middle. I thought maybe it was stuck, so I pulled on it *gently* and the whole dial broke off.So now I have a rather large paperweight. Guess I know that I need to spend more money on a blender next time.Thanks, Oster!"
4,Works well for what it is,"When my 20+ year old ugly, cheap blender finally broke a second time, I thought I'd splurge and buy a new blender. I found this model on a popular auction site. The metal-looking plastic isn't impressive, but it looks good. The glass jar is nice and heavy, and the interior ribs help make sure that things blend the way you want them to. The lid is a floppy material that's an improvement over the old, rigid lid I had on my old blender.I wouldn't try and crush ice in this thing. The motor smells like a toy train transformer after a few seconds, but all we use it for is mixing up protein shakes and fruit smoothies, so all it has to do is blend frozen berries. The pushbutton is a good idea, and the range of speeds is more than ample.Overall I was fairly happy with the purchase. Not a bad value. It does what I want it to do and didn't cost an arm and a leg."
1,And now my kitchen smells like gunpowder....,"This blender was a wedding present, and while we might have been satisfied with it for the first 6 months, our honeymoon period has run out. It doesn't have enough power to blend well (if you add 2 cups of food, only the bottom 1/3 cup will be ""blended"" - the rest will sit on top.) We even had to coax it through blending a milkshake with a wooden spoon. Furthermore, the motor burned out incredibly quickly, and every time we use it the whole kitchen smells like gunpowder. I won't be buying anther Oster to replace this dud."
3,Good product for good price,Liked the way the product worked. The blades over work after a while and might not give you the satisfaction.Large quantities are ok to blend but small quantities get stuck to the bottom which was a -ve for me.
1,Shame On You Amazon!!!!!,"This is a WARNING to anyone thinking about buying this innocent blender. DON'T!!!!This is a sicko trap to steal your hard earned money, and Amazon- you should be ashamed.The blender looks good and works for a few times, but then the electronics, which are total junk, go kerfluey and that is all she wrote folks. Kiss your money good bye."
4,Seems like a fine product,"This blender seems like a worthwhile product. It looks great in our kitchen, but we haven't had an opportunity to use it yet. The controls are simple to use without a lot of electronics to go bad. The only negative we see so far is that the pulse button in the center of the controls is always live, so it's easy to bump it by accident. We like this very solid machine.We're saving the glass ""jar"" from our old, ancient Oster blender becaause it also fits this new Oster and might come in handy some day."
5,"Great cables, great price","HOSA makes great high-quality cables, and this MIDI cable is another shining example. I'm using it to connect a Behringer FCB1010 to my MBox 2. These cables come pretty tightly packed, so bake them in the hot sun for 30 minutes to get rid of the factory coil.Pros:- Durable and thick- Molded strain relief- Length does not seem to affect transmission- Price beats any music storeCons:- NoneBottom Line:Need a long, durable MIDI cable without breaking the bank? Buy this."
3,High price to save the world,"What you have to buy to fit the slim jim recycling can, but way over priced for a piece of plastic with holes in it. For a school and paid for with peoples tax money to educate kids to save the world that adults have littered. How about a price break for schools?"
3,"Yes, but it is still a good book","I agree with the other reviewer, this book has concentrated on the areas exactly as he stated, however I still think this is a very nice book, and the pictures / places in it are very good. Spain is a beautiful place and this book is a bit one-sided, although to be honest I didn't even notice that until I read the other review.If you are interested in the things it does concentrate on, it is a very nice book. If you are looking for the things it has stayed away from, or you are looking for an overview of Spain, well it might not be the book you are looking for.Please note I have travelled all over Spain."
5,Astounding,"I am blown away by this 4-CD box set. The music sounds great. The mastering is superb. The musicianship is incredible, as is the energy. Brilliant solos. Great songs. I just don't get tired of Bob. Nice 36-page narrative plus discography. All very well packaged. Recommended highly at any price, and the actual price is insanely low."
3,"Less talk, more fiddle","I love this band, but Bob talked too much, sabotaging his own greatness as a band leader. His commentary was unnecessary and often annoying. His fiddle playing and vision of Western Swing was amazing. Charlie Parker was even a fan!"
1,Waste of money...,"Don't bother purchasing this eyelash curler. I am a self-proclaimed lash expert. The search for the perfect eyelash curler is a never-ending plight for me. The tweezerman pocket falls way short of achieving any type of natural looking curl. It basically 'bends' your lashes and the bend doen't typically stay put. If you're going to buy an eyelash curler, the best so far in my experience is the Tarte and the second best is the cheapy rite-aid brand."
3,Songs are alright but.....,"I was disappointed in the sound quality.. i have bought similar CDs of by-gone era and i know good quality sound is achievable.I guess you don't expect too much from it , it is a good buy."
5,Girl Group CD,"This is a great CD. If you like the hits on it, BUY IT. They are all ORIGINAL recordings, and the sound reproduction is excellent. I bought a second CD because I wore the first one out!"
4,Golden Memories,"I found the CD to be a source of great memories. It took me back to school and all of the things girls did to get their guy or when they lost him. Great fun and good music! CD quality was also great. Were there some songs missing? Sure, but it's only one CD."
1,Well I got a pretty screensaver out of the deal,"Other than the backgrounds and screensavers, it is of NO use. Very disappointed with this mandrake, do yourself a favor and don't fall for the five star reviews. A diaper has more functionality than linux does, the worst part is it actually cost moeny.Not very pleased, use Windows it actually works!"
1,Yet another knock-off compilation,"Steve Howe said 'yuck' when someone showed him this. His advice was that if it doesn't have Yes's logo, than they didn't sign off on it. As the discription indicates this merely samples stuff from the Ladder, Open Your Eyes and the live House of Yes"
4,Powerful!,"This is a powerful book. I'm not sure that I can explain it but it sticks with me. It is very haunting. Just when I thought I had figured it out, I realized that I had not. The is fine, fine writing by one of my favorite authors. I gave it only a 4 because I do not trust 5 reviews."
3,Good except for the slow start and finish,While the bulk of the story is a captivating way of experiencing the magic of Seattle and harsh realities of being a homeless vet the novel is bookended with a slow opening and a confusing ending. In both cases I found myself rereading passages just to figure out what was happening. The slow start nearly kept me from reading the rest of the book but I am glad I had continued reading.
2,"Sorry, not for me.","Wizard of the Pigeons is a standalone novel set in Seattle in the 1980s.Wizard is a homeless ex Viet Nam veteran living in a makeshift room on the abandoned upper floor of a department store. His magic, the Knowing, binds him to tell the Truth to the people who share their troubles with him. But there are rules too: he must never have more than one dollar in his pockets, must remain celibate, must feed and protect the pigeons.In this book, we follow Wizard in his daily routine in the streets and squares of Seattle, or riding the free bus line, until he meets Lynda, a waitress who decides to help him, but who might also put his magic in danger.Even though I'm a huge fan of Robin Hobb's books, I must admit urban/contemporary fantasy is definitely not for me, even written by someone as gifted as her, and I was rather impervious to Wizard's story. Sorry."
3,Cute for small dogs too!,"I used this as a New Year's dress for my Chihuahua and she looked absolutely adorable. I used the neck tie as a headband and she looked precious. The tulle ripped pretty easily when I had it in storage but then again, I didn't expect it to last forever."
2,I'm sure the people who make and buy this product mean no harm but ...,"...in general cats hate wearing clothes. They find it humiliating and uncomfortable. I've had a cat in the house since I was 17 and none of them would have anything to do with clothing. Not even something practical like a sweater in very cold weather. This has been true for both my purebred Birman and my various shorthair mixed breeds.Dogs on the other hand, in general, love to wear scarves, shirts, sweaters, etc. If it pleases you they're up for it. The two German Shepherds I've had have loved wearing both sweaters and scarves.Unless you really know your cat will enjoy this, don't do this to him/her."
4,The book is relevant to Pakistan here and now,"This is essential reading for anybody who wants to know why Pakistan is impoverished, broken and bankrupt and once again under military rule. This is the compelling story of one man's fight to prevent that happening and the failure of fledging institutions to stand up to the subversive activities of a ruthless and corrupt elite. Its scholarly too so prepare for a challenging read. This is a break through in sub-continental history - no ""Orientalism"" here to bewitch the Western reader; unpalatable facts, of which there are many are served up plain and unvarnished - what an achievement!"""
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"Bill Peet is not up to his usual quality of writing in COWARDLY CLYDE (1979). One senses a building story, but the climax falls short, even for a (fairy) tale. The pictures are great, but the climax is too simple, unrealistic (yes, I know this is of the ""fantastic"" genre), and quick, and will leave the young reader or listener with disappointment. I know other reviewers point to moral, emotional, social and character-building lessons the book MAY teach, but all I can say--as someone who has read many such GOOD tales for both my own pleasure and young students'--I was disappointed.The Creative Teacher: Activities for Language Arts (Grades 4 through 8 and Up)"
5,Best of: Steve Wariner = Great Compilation,"The price may have been a little higher than I would like because this is an import, but it was worth it. If you are a fan of Steve Wariner, this is a MUST have CD!"
4,"Good Movie, ""Eh"" Transfer","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The acting is wonderful, the photography is great, and the real 'noir' feeling of it is wonderful. But, for those who have not seen it, you must be patient. The movie does not travel at 100 MPH like several of the modern movies, it is rather a slowly paced, slowly unfolding movie. You must be prepared to sit, watch, and enjoy. It is also a very humorous movie. This movie can teach you to appreciate and even laugh at the bizarre. However, no matter how much I love the movie, the DVD transfer is at a 'so-so' level. It is grainy, and the big spots that are usually invisible when remastered are still there. Also, the only extra is a biography on Ms. Harry. So, if you can appreciate slow moving movies and mediocre transfers, then this movie is a must have."
2,"Union (rhymes with) ""City""","Long awaiting this release on DVD and fully expecting technology to chime new life into this dark pleasantry of a Debbie Harry fan's movie, I was virtually STARTLED at the grain and blocking of color that Union City in DVD format suffers. Sometimes the images appear to actually be a grid of sorts with the worst-ever digital transfer possible. You see a milky haze over the entire production along with the ""jigsaw puzzle"" appearance of some of the shots not noticed on VHS tape copies. An ""SLP"" recording of Union City on a bad VHS tape that is 15 years old is actually clearer than this DVD and I can prove it. I wouldn't have wasted my time if I weren't so angered at the loss of money and hopes."
1,worst transfer of film to DVD ever,"This would be a great DVD if only the transfer were at least mediocre. It is in fact possibly the worst transfer of film to DVD I've ever seen. I remember seeing this film at the Filmex film festival many years ago, and recalling the cinematography by Ed Lachman to be way too cool. None of that is apparent by watching this release by Fox Lorber. Please, someone release a better version!"
1,Not a good item to ship,"This handle came comletely cracked in half. Nevertheless, I had to return it, without reordering. I would not recommend that this item be shipped. I had to buy a replacement at the store."
1,Gets extremly Hot and terrible customer service support,"The device gets so hot I'm afraid of leaving it alone to record my shows while away. Customer service is terrible, and only the first call is free, then they charge you to even ask a simple question. Do not recommend this product, and will not buy anything from them again!My 2 cents."
3,Okay but does not work with digital set-top box. Poor Customer Service,"I bought this before I knew about Clear QAM and digital encryption. So if you plug your cable straight from the wall to the stick then it works fine. But if you want to take advantage of the digital channels that are available through the set-top box that is given to you (I'm with Rogers in Toronto) then forget it. I called Support and they kept me on hold for 45 minutes bouncing me back and forth and then ended up saying, ""We'll email you the answer in 2 days"". WRONG! They didn't do anything but send a survey asking how the service was. Also, the EyeTV Lite software is okay but to upgrade to the full version is $80. Don't make the same mistake I did and get the Hybrid or something that gets Clear QAM signals or whatever. I still haven't figured it out and I'm hesitant in paying another $150 to find out."
1,Installation CD would not load - No supoort,"I will never know how Amazing this device is because the CD would not even load. There is NO SUPPORT for this product on their website and the Support Phone Number provided in the box has a recording that says NO SUPPORT is provided at this number. You are then directed back to the website that doesn't even mention this product. 3 strikes, your out! Back in Box!!Even if it works out of the box you better hope you NEVER need support. Don't bother!"
1,If you loose the remote you are out of luck.,I bought this product and lost the remote and can not replace it because its not sold alone. So be aware that if you loose the control you can not replace it. For that reason I give it a one.
2,Not Thrilled,"There was a chip on the top corner of one of the frames. Also, the description says made of wood. There was no wood at all. The frame material was some sort of composite."
4,Imperial 8X10 double picture frame,The picture frames were exactly what I was looking for and are proudly displaying our recent formal photos from a Caribbean cruise.
2,Hinged double 8 x 10 frames,"This product is exactly what I was looking for and was perfect for the photos. However, when received the product had a few small nicks and scratches."
1,Very disappointed!,"The quality of the frame that I received from Dazzling Gifts was very poor. First, it was a double frame, and the two frames were bolted together unevenly. Second, there was a scratch in one of the frames. Finally, the edges of the frame looked like they had been chewed up. Very poor quality. I even requested to exchange the frame for another one. When the second one arrived, it was just as bad. In fact, one of the frames was bolted to the other upside down. The only positive thing about my purchase was that I got a quick refund. I was very disappointed in my purchase! Don't waste your time!"
4,One thing I'd do differently as the maker,"The frame is gorgeous. The gold is nicly understanted, the deign is beautiful. The only problem I had was in trying to hang it It would not go flush to the wall. The hooks to hang them are on opposite sides from one another, not where they can be utilized in hanging it on a wall. Same with the 5x7 double and triple frames... had to remove the back and turn them around, then secure the one edge not reinforced on the back with cuct tape. If they are putting things on the back to allow them to be hung, why can't they be sure the hooks all face the same way instead of some being right side up and some at the bottom??? It is due to this one flaw that they only get a 4 out of 5. Whoever is assembling these needs to pay attention to what they are doing. But the fames are beautiful."
1,Not much here!,"Product has great illustrations, but nothing that helps you understand how the illustrations came to be. A real disappointment."
2,A lab book type textbook,"This book is of almost absolutely no value to the beginner if unassisted by a legitimate apprentice program run by a master.There's a lot between the lines of this text which can only be filled in by an apprenticeship program.Good reference, I suppose. We'll keep it in the library for those rare occasions where we may need an obscure technique or tool application.Also, quality wise, the binding isn't up to snuff.Greg PietteGG LLC"
4,"Sturdy, authentic...small.","I wanted a traditional Chinese style cutting board and found this one. It was the smaller, and cheaper version, and still had a pretty hefty shipping fee. At the end of the day I wish I had gotten a bigger size, the 12"" just isn't large enough for me to work on comfortably. It is extremely durable and will last for a long time if cleaned and maintained properly. It came seasoned with oil and salt which needs to be done regularly to keep it from molding. Definitely not for someone looking for a easy to use cutting board, but a high quality excellent cutting board none the less."
4,Not a case of 6. Just one.,"Add listed as 6 but you only get one. About a week after I received just one they sent me an apology letter that I could return it, but the add was incorrect."
4,BIG!,"I was looking for the bin that Virginia Tech puts in all the dorms, and this is definitely not it. It's bigger! Probably 25%-33% wider (side with recycle symbol), a couple inches deeper/taller, and a smidge shorter. It easily fits three, brown, paper bags side-by-side. Surely I can fit more crap into it, but if I were to do this order over again, I would purchase the 14 gallon bin.Shipping to Northern Virginia was under 24 hours, but I suppose that's not surprising since it came from Hanover, Maryland."
5,Recycle Bin,This is nice...strong. Very durable for recycling...I put wheels on mine for easy transporting from front of my home to back and vice versa.
2,Absolutely terrible tehcnical quality,"I love old B movies, so I was really looking forward to this collection. I was terribly disappointed by the technical quality of the reproduction, however. The sound is so poor I often found it difficult to follow the dialogue, and the visuals are grainy and ugly. Furthermore, I found the navigation system extremely primitive and difficult to use. This ""bargain CD"" is really no bargain, although a few of the movies on here are real gems."
3,"i don't know what happened,this one was ok","most of these 20 packs have been the worst,but this gift was really ok,not the best movies but i could watch them and most i didn't have"
5,"Hey, it's Scooby Dooby Doo watch it - it's great !!!","Hey, it's Scooby Doo - what else is there to say?? I liked them as a child and still do !!"
4,Good deal,If your little one loves Scooby like mine does this is the DVD for you. Its got 14 episodes that each have a catchy music number in them. Also a lot of episodes that you don't constantly see on CN.
5,Excellent for Scooby-Doo fans,"I bought this bought this for my nephews, as they are big fans of Scooby-Doo. They have thoroughly enjoyed watching the episodes on this disk (even I enjoyed watching them). Great value for the price if you're a fan of the new Scooby-Doo cartoons."
3,Dareyes and Chapo DVD,Esta mas o menos. Hubiera estado mejor si usaran cancionesmas nuevas de Los Dareyes.
4,Entertaining Lesbian Fantasy,"I found this book very entertaining. The characters were well described and very likable even down to the minor ones. Also, the way the author built up the sexual tension around Cydell and Elayna was breathtaking.In this novel, both men and women can make their partners pregnant. This is a theme I personally have no problems with. However, I thought that since she went to the trouble of telling us that this was possible, I would have liked a bit more information. Eg. How do the women make each other pregnant? & perhaps even could men also become pregnant? If Jacqui Singleton had elaborated a little more on that topic this book for me would have gone from a very good read to an Excellent one. None-the-less, if you're a lesbian who loves fantasy books with magic spells, dragons and sabers than this book is well worth the read."
3,Hartstone & Saber,"A really good first book. Pretty easy to read. Has pretty good smutty parts. it is a little choppy in places, but definately an enjoyable read!!"
3,a very good book,"HEARTSTONE & SABER WAS NOT LIKE ANY OTHER BOOK I HAVE READ I HEALD MY INTEREST AT THE END I HAD SOMETHING I NEVER EXPECT TO SEE. IT WAS VERY VERY GOOD. BUT TO GET TO THE END YOU HAVE TO START FROM THE BEGING AND THAT WAS NOT TO GOOD. IT STARTED OF VERY WELL AND THEN MID WAY THOUGHT THE BOOK IT GOT BAD, BUT IF YOU COULD WHOLE OUT THOUGH THIS LOW I WILL FIND A VERY WONDERFUL ENDING SOMETHING YOU WILL NEVER BELIVE."
2,Not too good,"I didn't think this CD was too great. It had artists which are now long gone (out of style) and it was hard for me to understand why so many people liked it. The music was OK but it just wasn't the kind of CD that I would like to listen to during the Christmas season, and neither would the rest of my family. I'm sorry for all the teeny boppers I hurt, but this is my oppinion.Please no hate mail."
1,"INSTEAD OF COAL IN YOUR STOCKING, YOU MIGHT GET THIS!",Remember that story about Santa putting coal in your stocking if you weren't good? Coal would be better than this tired collection. The Spice Girls can't carry a tune in a Cheverolet and they are just plain bad to boot. They are lackluster and have no talent. The Backstreet Boys provide some nice harmony. They have something to offer. The Spice Girls are the coal in your stocking.
1,"Poorly checked, incorrect answer key, not very helpful for grammar review","Based on its cover, this book looked promising. But as I went through the mini lessons, I found redundancies in grammar points and mistakes as I reviewed the answer key. Reading the book was a thoroughly frustrating experience."
4,WPOP,"The cut ""No God To Cry"" by the Wildweeds brings back fond memories of listening to Hartford, Connecticut's now defunct WPOP. The illuminating liner notes from pop obsessed Dick Bartley make this a fun package ."
2,All Songs don't sound like orginals,"I've noticed a lot of collections like this have songs in them that don't sound like the songs I remember. This is disappointing. If I knew there were so many songs like this, I wouldn't have bought it."
5,just what I needed for a still life painting,Looks exactly like the photo and is actually quite beautiful. I used it as a reference to paint a still life and I use it for my painting students to study figures.
5,Great,"Saw these guys at Woodstock 99 one of the best bands there, the album is way cool I especially like Too Far"
5,Very Good,"just took it on a backpacking trip to costa rica, good product fast shipping highly recommend"
2,Bad Stitching,"We bought 3 of these bags & 2 of the 3 were defective. The straps were not stitched well & broke 10 min into our hike. We had to tie different straps together to continue the hike. We are returning them for a refund, beware check stitching if you buy this backpack."
1,You get what you pay for,"This is probably the worst backpack I've bought. I bought it specifically for a camping trip to Acadia National Park for a few days. It was not a backcountry camping trip and I had left it in my tent at the base camp through the entire time and yet after 4 days when I picked it up, one of the shoulder straps came of!!!TERRIBLE PRODUCT - DO NOT BUY - Pay a few $$ more and get a better backpack....."
4,Well worth the price,"This was great for a 2 day trip. Would not backpack a week in it (though that's obvious from the size). I was worried it was poor quality, but it worked fine. This style of pack requires rope to attach sleeping bag, sleeping pad, etc. to the outside straps/attachment points. Other packs attach stuff a little easier; however this contributes to its slim profile and what are you backpacking without a good length of rope for anyway?"
2,Not Terrible,"This pack isn't bad for the price. Unfortunately though the phrase you get what you pay for applies completely, while I would not consider this a well made in anyway it can actually take a beating. With a full load this pack is a terribly uncomfortable ride, and the suspension is not that adjustable. The bottom line is that if you are just looking for a casual summer weekend outings this pack is perfect for the price, but if you want a product that is dependable for the long haul then one should definitely spend more on quality that will last."
5,more than i expected,"great weekend pack. actually has more room than i was expecting. no problems encountered yet but for the price its pretty hard to beat. only negative is that i have pretty broad shoulders and its a little snug for my frame, but i expected that."
1,Dont worth the money,"Bought this backpack for a Disney Florida vacation, after just 5 days of use, nothing more heavier than carring my kids and mine coats, the right shoulder strap snaped free. If I was not returning to my country, I will have returned this to Amazon, but saddly I will have to suport the money loss.."
2,Only 23 minutes long!,"I bought this DVD as a Christmas gift for somebody and was shocked to find out that it's only 23 minutes long! That information was missing from the product details, but hopefully Amazon will add it now that I've submitted a ""missing product information"" request.So anyway, no DVD should be 23 minutes. This DVD just isn't worth it."
2,good,"very good midi cable, for the price. no lag with the data transmission. but it took forever to be delivered."
3,All his hits,All of his hits are here but he was not that great. The falsetto made him big but the songs were weak.
5,The best!!!,"Runaway was the best rnr song ever. The great hooks, synthesizer,etc., it's ground breaking. There's nothing better than Runaway."
4,A Song Is Missing,"Not a bad Del Shannon cd but a Del Shannon tune is not on it. The tune ""I Go To Pieces"" is not on it,you know it as a British Invasion hit. And after you hear it, you'll know why he didn't have a hit with it."
1,Only a few good ones,I was disappointed as I didn't realize how may bad songs Del Shannon recorded. There were just a few that were worth listening to.
5,thank you Dr Hite,"so I was taking a course in a master's degree in education and the teacher had written a book--not the class text, so I thought I would attempt to gather some insight into the teacher...and buy his bookit was worth the time and the money!"
1,Not a good buy,"Ultra-Lite Oil-Free sunscreen pump bottle would not spray. Contents were lumpy, clumpy and serparated as though it had out-lived it's shelf life."
2,Not a set as described,"This is a very nice tote. The reason I am giving it such low stars is because when I placed the item in my cart, it was described as a set of 6 totes. They were to be used for my kindergarten students as table organizers for daily supplies. I received one tote. By the time I ship it back, it will have cost me nearly the price of the tote, so I'm stuck with one tote that can't be used in my room. :( Wish the description had been accurate."
2,so much potential lost (nothing to do with translation)...,"I was very excited at first with this series. Looked good, sounded good, as fare as I could tell translated well, and the first volume was great! But, (yes but) it completely let me down with volume two. It was so pushed, cramped and out right bland and more. At first read great, leave it at that though. Disappointing!"
5,Ez-Flo 15001 Economy Shower Head,"This showerhead is just what I needed. The only thing ""economy"" about it is the price! It works GREAT and is easily cleaned by just unscrewing the white plastic diffuser at the end of the head (NO NEED to unscrew the whole unit from the shower arm).I easily removed the ""water saver"" plug from the attachment end by just pulling it out before screwing it to the shower arm and I get full flow. I'd rather adjust my flow from the water handles of my shower anyway so I can control water usage during a shower and not let a plastic plug control it for me.This is a nice cheap showerhead!"
1,Cheap piece of garbage,our apartment came with this exact shower head. it sucks. it is the reason we are on here looking for a replacement right now!
5,Author Review Update,"Published in 1998, the 4 model portfolios in the book, and the methodology for constructing them, held up extremely well from 1998 - 2006. Most of the advice and strategies are long-term in nature and not effected by changes in tax and pension legislation."
5,An excellent personal finance book for retirees/pre-retirees,"You're Retired Now What? is an excellent personal finance book for retirees and pre-retirees, alike. It contains an abundance of valuable information and is written so that the average person can understand it. I highly recommend this book for any retiree or pre-retiree."
4,Diagrams are a little difficult to read on Kindle version,"The book is well written, and a good introduction to the subject matter. There are a lot of line diagrams throughout the book, and it is difficult to see the details on the kindle version. Even when viewed on a large computer monitor, the diagrams are difficult to read. This is important because the diagrams contain valuable text."
4,Good basic MIDI cable,"This is a good, basic quality MIDI cable. The main attractiveness to me (studio use, mostly permanent attachment) was price, cable length and cable configuration (two leads per cable). Basically you have two MIDI cables bound together which neatens some of the wiring over dual separate cables and eliminates my old trick of using twist-ties or cable Velcro to hold the cables together. Just pull apart the length you need on the ends (like an electrical lamp cord) and plug. I haven't had any problems with stuck notes or other interference on my cables, and I'm not being especially careful about where I run them (near power, etc.)"
4,"Very, Very Addictive!","When I first got this game i thought it wasn't going to that good, only getting around three stars from. It is a very fun game if you can get past some of the characters,(a little fat boy who drives a mech thing), and the annoying music. But, you will find yourself humming the tunes! The battle system is similair to Final Fantsy Tatics and Vandal Hearts, but you are in knight looking mechs. This game is also very addictive, you will be in your room for DAYS! Buy this game, but buy Final Fantsy Tatics first."
5,Great Book,Currently I am in an intensive language course at BYU and we used this book the first week to learn the Alphabet of Arabic. With this book and hard work my class was able to write the alphabet in just one week and understand the vocabulary words given within the book. This is the best out on the market. I know if you are willing to put in the time you will be able to write the alphabet in one week if you choose to do so. Like any language it takes a great deal of work but the rewards will be endless. I highly recommend this book to beginning students of Arabic.
5,Excellent,Great for beginners. Has a good pace that is easy to keep up. You will definitely want the answer key book to go along with this.
3,Expensive but the best,"This book is the best of its kind for learning the Arabic script, but is expensive."
3,Workbook #1,"This is a somewhat cumbersome workbook designed for conventional advanced high-school or college-level classwork. I find it to be neither poor nor excellent, hence my rating of ""3."" It does not seem overly useful for self-study. One comical flaw on the front cover is the listing of the authors in English in an order that does not correspond to the listing in Arabic."
1,Not for me,"Wow! This soap has a strong scent. Doesn't lather for beans AND it's expensive. I don't know, maybe I'm not refined enough or cultured enough or educated enough but I can't see spending the kind of money this soap costs and not loving it. Just because it costs more doesn't make it better. Once burned, always learned. Truefitt and Hill Luxury Shave Soap? Not for me."
2,keep your minds open,This guy did the best an atheist can but I suggest anyone reading keep their minds open and read alternative views eg: the wonder of the world by varghese. Although brave attempts are made to explain for eg why there is something rather than nothing you would find upon further study an eternal non intelligence is as unexplainable as an eternal intelligence as the ultimate source of anything. Even so there are many many things about reality you would find as you look deeper from alternative views that require that the ultimate source of everything be intelligent. By the way can Mr Stenger create anything that somehow just occured ultimately without cause which is what you must believe if you are an atheist?
1,Doors flimsy cannot hold glass,"""The doors arrived in a large heavy box; the cheap pressboard wood frame of the door could not hold the heavy glass - the frame had split in several places during transport.You are supposed to anchor the top on the wall. This is because the glass in the front is the heaviest part, and the bookcase will tip over.Very cheap material!!!"""
5,Zany Madcap Slapstick Comedy,"What is there to say about Curly, Larry, Moe and Shemp. They are always good for goofy comic relief, and God knows they are certainly unique characters that can be counted on for a laugh...nyuk nyuk nyuk!"
5,EEDIOT,THIS IS GONNA BE SO AWESOME!!!!! REN AND STIMPY ON DVD. THIS DISTURBING HILARIOUS CARTOON HAS BEENSUCH AN INSPIRATION TO MY CARTOON ELK AND MOOSE. CAN'T WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT!!!!!!!!YOU EEDIOT
5,What a great show,"It's Ren & Stimpy! How could anything go wrong?! Chances are, if your interested in this, you already love Ren & Stimpy, and if you love Ren & Stimpy, go for it. It's got great episodes like The Cat that Laid the Golden Hairball, Space Madness, Svn Höek, Rubber Nipple Salesmen, Stimpy's invention (which contains Happy Happy Joy Joy), and it even has the Log commercials. What a great DVD.The interviews are pretty good too, and they give you a new appreciation for the characters and the work put into them.Definitely recommended."
3,Special Edition DVD??,"So I bought this set which is really great, but where is ""Man's Best Friend"" the banned episode, it's supposed to be on the DVD right? Is it hidden? What's the deal? I've watched the entire set and nothing. I 've looked through every menu on each DVD and nothing. Did I get an incomplete set or is there something I don't know?"
1,Uncut is in fact CUT!!!!,"I was highly disappointed to find out that some of my favorite episodes are cut-up for no apparent reason. If you want the details on what is cut, look it up on the message boards, it's out of the bag Paramount! This is false advertising and a real crappy release. I am sending it back and waiting another 10 years for them to get it right. I could cry I am so upset right now. Paramount slurps donkey, I will never trust them again!"
1,Thanks for the heads up!,"I was just about to buy this set when I read that it is falsely advertising these episodes as uncut. Hmmm. It's not so much the cuts that are disappointing to me, it's that it is blazoned right on the front of the box that these are uncut. That IS false advertising. No, I won't be buying this set and I came so close too.Sad.Save your money for the next Looney Tunes Volume. THEY are uncut and DO NOT even say so on the front of the box!"
4,Love it,I was sceptical at first but i think its Great and i would recommend this to all!! Who loved this show!! A little over priced
5,funny,I remembered watching this show years ago and forgot ho funny it was. The never before seen episodes are great. This is not for young children.
2,Warning!! False Advertising. These episode are NOT uncut!,"I can't tell you how angry I am with Paramount. I have been waiting for the original episodes of ren and stimpy since I purchased a dvd player. Finally a set which is supposed to be UNCUT (it says so right on the box), is really nothing more then the SPIKE TV versions of the show. Its a sad, sad day for Ren and Stimpy fans. Sure something is better then nothing, and the extras are very good, but this blatant false advertising is unacceptable. I will continue to wait for the true classics to be released one day, at this point I don't know if that will ever happen. Sigh. The MOTLOS forums weep. 10/6/04 Edit: I may have been over-reacting a bit when I first wrote this. This is still a great set despite the cuts, if anything the cuts are just upsetting for Die-hard fans. This set still contains hours of one of the best cartoons of all time, and is highly recommended to any fan of animation. Long live John K!!"
4,Great show but not so great DVD collection,"I loved Ren and Stimpy. I remember when I was little, I used to either watch it on Snick (some of your remember that big orange couch) or get up early in the morning on a sunday to watch it. anyway, I am happy that they did release this collection. I still love every episode of the show. the only complaint (and it's kind of a big one too) is that they did cut some scenes out (most recognizeable is when they cut out Stimpy spitting in a jar in the Ren's Toothache episode) it's too bad because some of us really love that show and we want to see it complete, not cut. it's like taking some of the good parts of the Lord of the Rings movies and cutting them out. For those that don't have this, Paramount will be releasing a Ultimate collection with all episodes uncut, so I would wait if I were you."
1,NO WAY! HOW DARE THEY!,UNCUT!?!?!? yeah ok. I never knew uncut meant parts missing from the episodes. Come on. Dont buy it. Wait till somone makes a GOOD dvd set that this great cartoon deserves.
3,Uncut? whatever.,"I currently own this box set and was relieved that it was finally put to dvd but when i watched it I was disappointed that some of the episodes were still edited as well as the so called ""banned episode-man's best friend"" which seems to have mysteriously not made to ththird disk of the box set. I will say to get this dvd if you want to start a collection and if you are a fan of ren and stimpy, but if you are looking for a full uncut version with all the original scenes intact then this is not what you are looking for. To Mr. John K- if you see this please do your loyal fans a favor and give us unedited, uncut and complete ren and stimpy box sets, we deserve it."
1,Ren & Stimpy Have Sugery,UNCUT .....AH BALONEY!!This is nothing like the orignal episodes. Scenes cropped then cut and left laying on some editors floor somewhere.Once more its closed captioned (I'm deaf) nobody close captions DVD anymore due to the popularity of SUBTITLES. Subtitles are easier and cheaper to produce on a CD rather than CC encoding. So lame. But then again seeing as the product is made in mexico this doesn't surprize me. 99% of all the DVD I see come out of mexico are of such sub standard quality that you'd think they made DVD's out of old garbage can lids down there.In as much as I really like thr antics of Ren and Stimpy I just cannot justify paying for the LIE that this product is. UNCUT? HARDLY!THEY DID MAJOR SURGERY ON REN AND STIMPY.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON SUB STANDARD PRODUCTPowdered Toast Man will have his revenge on the twerps who produced this DVD collection
5,A d*** kid show!,O.K that F***ing waring on the D*** back makes it look like it was TVMA. This isnt the adult party cartoon! If parents got this they wouldint laughf! ITS A KID F***ing SHOW!!!!!!!!! Ren and Stimpy is really funny! It is also has some disgusting humer! The Edits are really obveious. Maby soon they will make a Fully uncut collection.
5,Awesome!,"I see some reviews that are very nit-picky about what is included and what is not. Coming from a regular person who used to watch this crazy stuff when he was younger, I can just say that it brought back some nice memories. :)"
3,"It's great that it's on DVD, but why is it edited?","Even on the cover of the set, it says ""UNCUT"". But recent news informs us that the DVD is edited, like what Nickelodian (sp?) did. You could sue Spumco, for false advertising. I'm still buying this set, however, since some of these cartoons are classics, paticually ""Mans Best Friend"", ""Stimpy's Invention"" and many others."
4,"""Oh Joy!""","Yes sir, I think I like it. If you're looking for a gross cartoon, look no farther than the Ren and Stimpy show. Characters like Ren Hoek go through many different changes constantly. He can be angry like he always is, and then go insane, no thanks to Stimpy. Things just couldn't get much zanier. The fun begins when characters like George Liquor show up because with people like him and pretty much anyone else that Ren and Stimpy meet, you NEVER know what could happen and how crazy things are going to get. As you might already know, Ren and Stimpy are basically the opposite of each other but still a team. This show is outstanding but very gross. Highly recommended for a good laugh."
4,Great -- but the edits spoil it a little,"This DVD is a MUST for any true Ren & Stimpy fan. Midway through the 3rd season, the exit of John K dramatically and adversely affected the show. The first two years show the Ren and Stimpy who really liked/loved one another, and who were actually pals. Later years degenerated into much cruder humor, with a Ren who was totally unloveable and a Stimpy with no character or personality at all. For some unknown reasons a very few minor scenes were edited out, which is why this gets a 4 instead of a 5. You don't *need* to see Stimpy put his cup of toothbrushing spit into the cabinet with all of the other cups, but if you saw it in the original, you will notice it is missing. But still, if you are tired of turning to a cable station and being disappointed when the Ren & Stimpy you are watching are not the original characters you knew and loved, this is the real deal."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"John K. is full of it. Spike TV had some of the scenes that are missing, so the originals aren't stashed away somewhere by NICK.I won't buy this set unless they recall it and fix the problem. It is blatant illegal advertising. It's a shame if they won't fix it, because there are quite a lot of fans out there turning this product down after hearing the news."
2,wtf is this,"The cartoons are CUT even though it says ""uncut"" on the cover. Ren & Stimpy should not be presented or treated this way. This is a travesty."
4,thank god- too bad,"i entiltle this pharagraph ""thank god- too bad"" because im so glad Ren and Stimpy is finally realeased on DVD but at the same time i wish i actually had all of the episodes like the box says i paid for. i was looking forward to watching some episodes that are not available and i don't very much like that im being tricked into thinking that the DVD has every episode aired. otherwise im glad i bought it-32 episodes for 30 bucks, thats less than a doller an episode...i guess thats pretty good... right? i don't know-the end"
2,WHY THE **** DOES ANYONE LIKE REN & STIMPY!,"It was a retarded show. Not funny or clever at all. Rocko's Modern Life was way better, and Rugrats was too (until, of course, the movie). However, I will give this particular collection a bonus star because it contains the episode that contained the only good thing about Ren & Stimpy, ""The Happy Happy Joy Joy Song"", which was absoulutly hilarious. Other than that this show is bull-poop. Don't waste your money."
1,Southern Cross,"Animals thinking? Aw, come on. Stereotyped characters and a gothic romance? Patricia Cornwell, shame on you. I've come to expect better writing from you than this."
2,Carry Me Back to Old Patricia!,"Patricia Cornwell has recently become one of my favorite authors, with her cover to cover suspense and intrigue, and her in-depth knowledge of the world of forensic medicine. That seemed to be secondary to the endless colloquial dialogue of Bubba, Smoke, Weed and the charming Divinity. Southern Cross went nowhere, and stayed there. The ending did create some excitement; not how it ended, but that it finally did end. However, like some of the addicts about whom she writes, I am looking forward to my next Cornwell fix. Just because you have one bad glass of wine doesn't mean that you're going to give up drinking!"
1,A Reader from Indiana,I was very disappointed in this book. I thought the characters were stereotypes and the women were not believable. The romance between West and Brazil is just plain boring. Why don't they communicate? They are both supposed to be intelligent individuals. I think Ms. Cornwell should go back to her excellent books with the forensic pathologist.
1,Misleading Information,"The product advertises 100,000 images. The vast majority are through its internet site. Those images are poor - arrows, buttons, etc. The clip art that is available on the CD is moderately useful, but looks to be created by one person - around half are of poor quality."
4,Great!!!!!,"this game is really good, its better then the console version!! its load time is a little slow and it has a bug where u cant get on to the internet with it, but there are more street events and like 5 more fields!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Just be aware...,"This is not your grandfather's or father's Schrade pocketknife. Taylor Brands moved manufacturing to the far east when they bought the brand, and the consensus is that quality is not comparable. The photograph shows handles of Delrin (plastic), not buffalo horn, and it's ""barehead"" (no bolster on the distal end), not ""bear head""."
5,Excellent,Love this knife! Very sharp right out of the box and holds its edge. Love the buffalo horn handle.
4,Praying in the Presence of Our Lord With St. Padre Pio (Praying in the Presence),"Praying in the Presence of Our Lord With St. Padre Pio (Praying in the Presence)Padre Pio was an extroadinary priest and person. He dedicated his life to serving others. All persons--Christian and non-Christian alike--can benefit from learning about persons who put the love of others above themselves.Padre Pio was also blessed by God with extroadinary gifts and he used these gifts for the good of people. He used his love for people and his selfless giving as his testimony to his love of God.This little book will give the reader insight into the beauty and depth of Padre Pio's love of God, church, and the ordinary person.The selection of quotations and prayers is beautiful and will give the reader immediate access to inspiration."
5,Very Good Book!,"This book was given to me by a priest and I have found it to be very useful for my prayer life. The Meditations are broken up into eight parts on various religious subjects. Then each subject is further broken up into a particular meditation which has the wisdom of St. Padre Pio, then some written explanation or commentary by Eileen Dunn Bertanzetti and then a prayer that can be recited for the various meditation. It is well put together and St. Padre Pio's words are very profound."
1,"Cheap, cheap, che...",You find copies like this in Dollar Store's and you feel ripped off! Cheap to say the least as the music was ripped from vinyl records and not pristine neither.The worst of deals and I would bet they didn't pay any royalties either.Run away and save your money..
1,OLD very old,"This has not been made sence the early 1990's. Why do people insist on selling old stuff ? The company that made salon selectives ""Helene Curtis was sold in 1996"""
5,Pop-Rock Sensation,"Even if you've never heard of JUDY and MARY, you will absolutely fall in love with this album! As a long-time listener of JUDY and MARY, I must say that this is their best CD yet; the only draw-back is that it dosen't include more songs! You will just fall into a trance when you hear Yuki's voice: She sounds like a sweet little girl, but, as you get a few seconds into the song, you can almost instantly hear the ""spoiled-brat"" attitude in her voice! Onda and Takuya's instrumentals will get your heart puming, and Kota's drums will get your brain bumping; meanwhile Yuki's singing will get you dancing! When you hear JUDY and MARY, you can't help wanting to get up and dance and sing along!"
3,Useful On Presenting Sales Information. Not Useful for Education-related presentations,"This book has some good useful information on how to prepare quality presentations in a sales environment. It is less useful if you are presenting in an educational situation.If you are in sales and have to present your company's products and services to prospects, it is worth reading. If, however, you present more in seminars and educational settings, it is less applicable. Buy it used, read it, then pass it on."
4,Great goost movie for the price.,"Basically, two scientists (husband and wife) are living at a house for a year to study a rumor of a haunting. The ghost becomes attached to the wife. Instead of studying the ghost, the couple decides to help it out. If I tell you anymore, I will give the movie away. This movie was done very well. The sound was great. If you have Surround Sound, you will be a little spooked. You will hear moaning from behind you, and walking around your house. I think for the price of the movie, it was a really good purchase."

3,DON'T ANSWER THE KNOCK,"KNOCKING ON DEATH'S DOOR is a sometimes spooky, often times murky, little ghost story. It opens with the savage killing of a cop with an ax, and then segues twenty years later to the wedding of a parapsychologist and a scientist. They are ""given"" as a wedding present the task of investigating the supposedly haunted house where the murder took place. Once there, they find there certainly is a ghost hovering about, and they decide to try to find out who the ghost is and what it wants.Although at times stiffly directed, the story moves along fairly well, and we get a few shocks along the way. Brian Bloom isn't very effective as the husband; Kimberly Rowe does well as the wife; and reliable David Carradine (a recent Golden Globe nominee for Kill Bill) plays a mysterious doctor.No real plot surprises, but an entertaning, relatively goreless shocker."
2,Caution: try mandrake move evaluation disk first.,"Have been Mandrake user, loved it. Dual booting withWin 98 & Win 2k & briefly with WinXP. But not since latestversion which is incompatible with dell machines. Swappedout the LG cd-rom with a new Sony cd-rom befoe installingand failed to install. Hope they fix the problem.Moved to SuSe Linux which installed easily after tryingtheir evaluation version which can be downloaded from theirsite as an iso image. (Takes a long time due to many droppedserver connections even with dsl.)Mandrake has a downloadable evaluation iso image calledMandrake Move. Downloads faster. Try before buying.Best wishes."
4,"Very Entertaining, 60's Pop Driving Music.","This has 18 songs & is roughly 45 minutes long. The sound quality is a bit mediocre at times, but these are quality tunes, & not just the well known big hits. Here you have ""People Say,"" by the Dixie Cups, The Shirelle's ""Baby It's You,"" the Jaynettes""Sally Go Round The Roses."" Which sounds half psychodelic before the term became common. There is even a young Cher singing ""Dream Baby."" This compellation should stir the appetite of even a casual listener to find more tunes from that eclectic era of music."
5,A knockout collection!,"First, look at the track listing. Then consider the fact that these recordings are of excellent quality, and are all by the original artists.And, not least, note the presence of ""Sally Go 'Round the Roses."" This song has often been called ""haunting,"" and I can't improve on that description, except to say that it's most unusual, and it's a pleasure to have it here."
4,Metafictional Classic,"Barry Malzberg's book ""Galaxies"" may have worked more effectively as a short story (it is essentially an expansion of his story ""A Galaxy Called Rome""), but this is still the most self-reflective/metafictional SF novel ever written. It is a groundbreaking book, well worth reading.Actually, this book isn't a book at all but notes on a book which the author will never have the skill to actually write. He admits as much from the very beginning, and then asks us to consider the plight of an intergalactic astronaut who is caught in a black galaxy, a negative space, the underside of reality, etc. The dead, her cargo, begin to talk. All the way we are kept one or two steps removed from the action, in order to more clearly see what this action truly reflects.Malzberg's book isn't for everyone, but if you're looking for an SF equivalent of John Barth's ""Lost in the Funhouse,"" this is it."
4,great cd!,"I was very impressed with this CD. It seems that each song expressed a different emotion, and the music takes you with it. Most songs are very catchy and leave you humming them long after listening. ""Always Sometimes"" is the standout track, and it is now one of my favourite songs. I can't say enough about it. I recommend this CD to everyone."
5,Ok...I like Garlic!,"I do not always have time to chop/crush garlic into fine bits so I rely on powder for certain recipies where I want the garlic blended in, such as my favorite fajitas recipie marinade I found on a can of Rosarita Salsa from the 1960's ( [...]) and this garlic powder works great in it!"
5,tones garlic powder,i havent had to use loads of this yet. its a big bottle and will be lasting me a long time. i use it with almost everything. it was fresh(not old). good price as well
2,"Nice, not great","A good watch, but next to the minds eye series which is ultra fanatastic, it pales in a serious way. I recommend The Gate, Odyssey and Beyond."
3,Good but not perfect,"Liked the story line but I guess I was hoping for better music. The graphics are good. The Roller Coaster part I saw at the Sinsheim Museum in Germany. I recommend The Gate, Odyssey and Beyond."
2,Get this for the music!,"Paul Haslinger, for a few years member of Tangerine Dream, has made a very good musical soundtrack which really kicks off in 5.1. If you dislike synthetic music, don't bother with this; if you do you will undoubtedly find that Haslinger has great musical talent, something which is hard to prove in this genre. So turn off your tv set and just listen."
2,Boring...,"OK, call me a Philistine, but although I approached this DVD fully intending to enjoy its artistic merits, I found after a short time that I was bored.... Not enough to hold my attention."
1,"Don't Bother, Very Boring","Many of the same type of scenes repeated over and over, I too must be a Philistine: very boring. Less than high resolution graphics. Absolutely nothing like the quality of the Mind's Eye series (which are great)."
2,UNDERWHELMING!!,"This title was a big dissapointment. With all duerespect,the people giving this dvd 5 stars must notwatch too much CGI. This is basically multi-coloredterrain done completely on desktop computers. Themusic is even worse. The only way to salvage thisdisc is to put on some music of your own and hopefor the best!"
2,Save your money,"This DVD is a jouney through computer graphics. I expected to see alien realms, instead I got to see different planets all remarkably similar to our own.The graphics are well done. but I would never have bought this DVD if I had known it was simply different permutations of our own planet.The graphics are excellent. The music was pitiful. Save yourself some money, give this one a miss."
1,zzzzz . . . Someone wake me up when it's over with.,What a bore. If you like watching an hours worth of unrealistic looking mountain flyby's then this one's for you. Otherwise stick to the awesome Oddessey Productions like the Mind's Eye series.
4,A mesmerizing journey!,"Sure, there are other 'eye candy' movies out there, and visually you can find things just as good. However, this movie's premise, as relayed in the beginning and ending voice-overs, combined with Paul Haslinger's excellent space music (which really shines in Dolby Digital 5.1), the pace and mood are combined for maximum effect to transport you to ""Oh Wow!"" land. It's just the ticket for arm-chair space cadets."
3,"3 1/2 - 4 stars, very nice for the time it was produced","This video is four years old now, ancient for that sort of thing, but it still does very well. I found that some of the scenes were a little flat but most looked very good, the view keeps moving so you don't have time to dwell on details that are probably lacking. At the story's end the aliens find the world they've been looking for, that is the most surrealistic part of the program and even some of that looked almost real. The Bryce rendering program has moved on a couple of generations since Planetary Traveler came out (5.0 is out now)I'd like to see what the artists can do with that!"
4,Very artistic. excellent vivid dynamic images and sound,"Basically, this topagraphical tour of several artistically concieved and contstructed worlds reveals stunning images and soothing sounds. The the vivid dynamic images and enveloping sound are excellent both in quality and content. I enjoyed it fully. It really demostrates well the DVD audio and video capability."
2,Expect Broken Case,"The chips are nice looking, but are too heavy for the felt-lined, plastic chip holder/divider inside the case. The sliding, heavy chips caused the chip holder to break probably sometime during the shipping and handling process. In addition, much of the felt lining throughout the case as unattached and scratched. A new one was sent out to me, but was also broken in the same way even after Amazon gave special instuctions for shipping. Therefore, there maybe a good possibility that the cases were broke to begin with. However, my husband kept the second poker set simply for its contents, and has plans to purchase a better case in the future. Amazon did credit us 20% for the inconviniece, although I was expecting more because the case is a large part of the set and will cost much more to replace."
4,Good chips bad case,"I purchased this set for two reasons. I wanted to have a complete set of matching chips for hosting our poker group and I am an ""old salt"" so they have sentimental value. The case is not very sturdy but with some regluing could be made serviceable; I have a sturdy case and am using that. Two of the 500 chips had very minor flaws but are serviceable. Overall I am pleased with the purchase the chips are what I expected as was the case. Another review described the rather low end case. Number and quality of the chips was excellant for the price."
3,just ok,"very disapointed in the quility of some of the movies, some were very faded, the picture quiltiy you exspect on a DVD just was not there."
3,AVERAGE,Not up to my expectations as I only enjoyed seveal of the selection. Maybe I am now getting too fussy
1,Not what I expected,I am an avid fan of Shirley Temple and when I placed the order I was under the impression that these were all her movies. However it was not since I do love old movies I did enjoy them but it really wasnt what I expected.
2,Beautiful but...,"This scribe looks very nice and can be re-sharpened easily as the point can be detached. However, the point isn't carbide. It doesn't create the nice crisp deep scribe lines I like. It sits in my toolbox un-used. My local tool store had a scribe for $2 with carbide point that I've been using for years."
2,limited use,"Since this book contains only nouns that can be illustrated, it is not useful for general work. For engineers and others with specific needs, it would be fine."
1,"Beware! this is the (old) first edition, not the latest edition.","The Wordly Wise 3000 Book 7 that was shipped is the old first edition book, not the new edition which is used in my son's school. Nowhere in the description of the book does it indicate that this book is obsolete. Beware! If your school uses the current edition, this book is out of date. I returned it for a refund. The current (second) edition is copyrighted in 2007, and has an orange and blue W on the cover."
5,dogwatch,"A fabulous foray into film noir, with a superb performance by Sam Elliott (as you've never seen him before). The dinner scene alone is an Academy Award style tour de force of acting. Check it out for dramatic complexity...and realistic depth of conflicted characters. Top ratings!"
2,Disappointed.,"I bought this because we wanted a good solidcorn house & porch broom. We had not been able to find one at our local stores.While it is moderately attractive and a good price,it is not substantive at all and disappointing."
5,"Precise, but delicate.","This is a quality scribe, but should only be used for delicate marking for precise measurements, not for engraving. It can handle engraving but the tip will suffer under higher pressure quickly reducing the accuracy a small amount. The tip brand new is under 0.1 mm. After engraving my initials in a stainless steel watch back and snapping a bit off the tip, it now measures about 0.2 mm, but is still sharp as a needle."
3,It's ok,"If you love sifi moves this would be a good buy for you, I like that there are so many moves on the dvd would tell people that get this kind of moves you will enjoy this one for sure."
3,You get what you pay for,"There are a couple classic movies in this pack. IN all it was pretty boring. Most of these movies are good for a laugh, but incredibly hard to make it totally through one."
1,Uncomfortable and disappointing,I bought this product because I just had spinal fusion and thought it would make sleeping easier. I received the product on time and was pleased with the appearance of the product. I found the pillow to be hard and uncomfortable for my neck. I found the products problem to be that it is made up of to many layers. I went back to using my contoured memory foam pillow.
1,Disappointed with Monsoon-Tales of the Kama Sutra 2,"The only redeeming qualities of this video: 1. seeing the picaresque beauty of Goa (a southern and coastal state in India---where vacationers visit the beaches) including the lush greenery/flowers and the beaches 2. learning a bit of the history of Goa. Other than those redeeming qualities: NOTHING. Does not live up to the title, at all."
1,Simple Review,This is below a B movie! The acting is atrocious! I made it through 3/4 of the movie and couldn't take it any longer! In one word... LAME!!
5,his uncle's colleague,"This book came serendipitously into my hands through Jonah Blank's uncle in San Diego. I read it a few years ago and have been looking for it so that I could give it to a friend. I have never been to India but am traveling around the world now, partly spurred on by Blank's great book and will surely get to India. Apparently, the author is/was in graduate school in (?)anthropology and might be in India. This book reminds me of Joseph Campell/mythology, history, culture, and travelogue melded beautifully together for a great read."
5,The book reviews are very good.,The book reviews are very good. I hope I get a chance to possess this book and read it. Why is it out of print for such a long time? Can you not get it reprinted soon? Do what ever possible; and get a copy for me.
3,Pricey,"As a whole, the JPS series of commentaries on the first five books of the Bible is excellent. However, of the five, I would say Sarna's efforts are the weakest. The Hebrew text is clear, the JPS translation well laid out, and the commentary extensive. However, if you are hesitating the pay the cost of this book, I would recommend Sarna's paperback, Exploring Exodus. While not nearly as lengthy as this commentary, Sarna's paperback contains most of the ideas that he elucidates in this volume. The same can be said of his JPS commentary on Genesis, which does not add much to his shorter paperback book, Understanding Genesis."
3,No More Paint,"Ended up being smaller than I was expecting and I was afraid my turtle was going to get stuck in it and he's tiny... Now it's in a 10 gallon tank with my frogs and they seem to like it! The other problem is that the first time I took it out to clean off some algae, almost all of the brown paint came off. I didn't use anything to wash it, just warm water and a paper towel. Now the whole thing is a hideous yellow color. I don't mind so much, but if you're going for a realistic look in your tank, this is not for you!"
2,not happy!,"I was happy with the price because it is a lot of paper! BUT, it has BLACK DOTS ALL THROUGH IT! NOT Good!"
5,A++ Service,"The book is 'like new' as promised, and it arrived two days early! To boot: it came in a nice, clean package. Great Job!Good Job!"
4,Nice Debut!,"Earwig records is a small label that has signed some pretty decent talent over the last several years including Big Jack Johnson ""The Oil Man"", Homesick James ""Goin' Back In The Times"", Pinetop Perkins ""With the Blue Ice Band"" and the lesser known Jimmy Dawkins ""Kant Sheck These Bluze"", Lovie Lee ""Good Candy"" Louisianna Red ""Driftin' and H-Bomb Ferguson ""Wiggin Out"".Despite the lack of a handle, Liz fits well with this group offering a traditional, gospel-tinged, approach to the blues. Like her colleagues, Liz does more than belt out a few tunes. On this CD, she also proves to be a capable composer, guitarist and vocalist. Her low down and somewhat gruff voice sets the table for some rather tasty numbers and her guitar work is pretty darn good. Best tunes on the disc are the title track ""Ready To Cheat"" and the slow-blues slide guitar number ""Reefer Woman"". With this release, Liz appears on the verge of a breakout."
3,"Speaks a lot, but says very little","If you are expecting a technical seminar on individual fusion articulation, this is it. These are consummate players doing what they do best- playing. I was disappointed with the lack of cohesive songwriting. I love dissonance in jazz and fusion as much as any player/fan, but this album left me begging for some sort of theme."
5,THIS IS A SMOKER!!!,"One of the best, if not THE BEST, power trios of all time! Scott Henderson is one of the hottest fusion guitarists currently being recorded. Victor Wooten's bass playing provides a melodic and yet full and very strong bottom. Steve Smith is truly a ""drummers, drummer"" whose experience in the jazz fusion genre shines through to round out this group. From hard driving rock to a rendition ""Giant Steps"" this CD is an auditory feast!"
2,Another ploddy jam disc,"I was looking forward to this disc when I heard of the lineup. Although Im not a fan at all of Victor Wooten. He seems to mix well with Steve and Scott. At first listen, a few tunes jump out at you . King Twang and Crash Course are the hottest numbers on this one. But after listening to this more and more everything else on here are just fillers. Scotts soloing is fierce and in your face, as is Steves. But once again im disappointed with the overall song content."
2,wank-fest,"i'm a big fan of Wooten and Henderson, and I expected this album to be amazing, but IMHO, it's just three top-notch musicians with amazing technique performing mediocre music. This record comes out sounding very tribal-techish, but TT kinda sucks without Gary Willis on bass. Wooten is a great player, but his style is just not really compatable with henderson's metal fusion."
2,"lots of chops,but thats it!","Being a huge fan of Steve Smiths work and of Scott Hendersons,naturally i had to get it.I was disappointed though after first listening to the whole recording.First,the songs are mere improvs that really dont do the listeners any justice. Oh theres plenty of chops alright,but i dont get the kind of feeling i usually get when the music clicks.And second,I HATE VICTOR WOOTENS PLAYING,his bass tone really sucks and if he couldnt use his thumb he would be in a different profession.He needs some lessons in technique and feel.Victor,listen to some Jeff Berlin or Jaco!"
2,Trading Options to win,"The book is written in a very informal way which is the style of the author (fine) but the gist of his trading strategy could have been explained much shorter. No graphs. The book could have been reduced to 30 pages max. He lulls the novice into trades which can break your neck. Although the way he thinks (trying to find an edge when setting up a trade) is correct the suggested strategies he likes the most are inherently short volatility and very risky. He also focuses mostly on commodity markets and I believe the edge that he found back then is gone by now. If you are serious about option trading and spreading then the must have books are: Option Market Making (Baird) and Charles Cottles Book ""The hidden reality of options trading"". Dont buy this book! Those books have been written by battle proven market makers."
2,Major Disappointment,The high reviews inspired me to purchase this book...but the contents are very general and the title consequently is very misleading...it doesn't teach anything about trading techniques...it's almost exclusively a book about trading psychology.
5,A great page turner,"I believe that many parts of FIDDLER'S Elbow are indeed true. The historical context is very well written and shows evidence of careful research. I was surprised by the ending even though I should have seen it coming. The scenes that take place in various places around the world are very well done. The reader feels as if he is actually there, so well does the author paint pictures using his knowledge of the places he writes about. The action is constant, but not more than I want to read about. A real page turner. I couldn't put it down."
3,weak point is wheels snap and break,"I've broken two of these now, each lasting about 7 to 8 years. The weak point is if you stand on it on even a slighly uneven surface (like one wheel on a kitchen rug and the other two wheels on the tile floor), the stem on the wheel caster will snap off and break. Because it is plastic and weight bearing, the caster wheel stem cannot be repaired. I've searched for a replacement caster, but it seems difficult to find an exact match. The step stool works ok with just two wheels, but doesn't roll as nicely, and I think it won't be long before another wheel snaps and breaks. I'm thinking of buying the all steel rolling kick stool. This model is almost all plastic material."
5,Great for Travel,"I love having these things around. I mountain bike and hike a lot so sun protection is a must. I always try to remember to apply plenty of sunscreen from a tube before a ride or hike, but sometimes I forget to bring the tube. These are so convenient that I can stick a few of them in my pack for such emergencies. They won't leak like a tube could do and are small so I don't mind having them as a permanent feature in my pack. I also store some in my vehicles. Tubes are likely to explode or go bad out in the AZ heat but these have lasted just fine."
5,Sun X Towlettes,"Very convenient and easy to use, especially when you need to reapply a sunscreen outdoors. Recommended by my dermatologist."
2,Towelettes,I just started playing golf and the towelettes are a lot neater and more convenient than carrying a bottle of suntan lotion. The towelettes do not spill and make a mess like the bottles of lotion can. I would recommend towelettes to anyone who is in the sun a lot and needs a fast convenient way to keep the sun from getting the best of you.
3,Undecided,"Unfortunately, out weather conditions have not contituted the full use and effect of this product yet.I'm hopeful that it will live up to it's previous reviews, on which I based my purchase."
3,Preferred other films of Martin and Lewis,"I feel that their 3 best films were ""Scared Stiff"", At War With the Army"" and ""Living It Up. And of all 3 I think ""Scared Stiff"" is the best. I could watch this over and over and good songs in it. And another treat that adds to the film is Carmen Miranda. Even if the film is in black and white, it helps with the theme of the film. I recommend this film to everyone and is a must for any Martin and Lewis film. I saw this when I was a kid and those were the days when movies were movies and didn't have to worry about any ratings on it."
4,"Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis' best. Good story, good music. Funny","Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis made a number of films together. I've seen most if not all of them. The Stooge is the duo at their best. Funny, well written, with good music. None of their other efforts comes close."
5,the best headphones i've ever used,I work in film composition and needed to be able to make accurate rough mixes for various productions from my home studio which is not treated for accurate mixing. These are expensive but they deliver incredibly accurate frequency response and I suppose that's just something that costs.
2,Poor durability makes these worthless,These headphones broke in less than a year. Sony replaced them for a $60.00 fee. The replacements broke in less than 3 months... They sound great but the build quality is appalling.
2,Not what it used to be,I bought my first pair of 7509HD in 2002 (made in China) and have been happy with them ever since. But the pair I recently bought in 2012 (made in Thailand) sounds totally different - exaggerated bass and low mids - the usual stuff you find in most headphones nowadays. Looks like Sony decided to make them more mainstream and totally killed the product in my opinion. So don't expect old crisp reference sound from them - it's gone.
2,It is just OKAY,"I use these headphones to record live instruments, vocals, mixing, and just listening to music.I personally do not like these headphones. I feel it does not give you a full dynamic rage. It is to heavy in the mid section. Even when changing my EQ it will gave me a heavy middle section.Other thing I did not like was the material used. It is cheap material that falls apart. I do use all my headphones carefully, everything is coming off this pair.If you are using these headphones for over 30 minutes it begins to get uncomfortable. Of course they are closed headphones there for it will be somewhat uncomfortable. But these where not at some times annoying.If you are looking for headphones go AKG 272 HD for closed or AKG 242 for ""semi"" open.They will be better in the long run."
3,too high end?,"I bought these for home recording with garageband, and they are nice- comfortable- BUT I may have went a little overboard on my expectations of them for my use- the are really for other pro uses in my opinion- if your are a professional studio person they might just be great for you. me, ehh- there okay."
1,Why buy this . . .,". . . when you can buy the Martial Arts 50-Movie Pack (http://www.amazon.com/Martial-Arts-Movie-Pack-Collection/dp/B0007DBJUU) FOR A LOWER PRICE and get, not only all twenty of these movies, but parts 2 and 3 of _Ninja Death_ as well? (Unlike _Black Cobra_, whose two sequels are included in the 50-pack too, _Ninja Death_ is all one big story arc. Part 1 isn't a complete story without parts 2 and 3.)Save your money and get more movies at the same time. Buy the aforementioned 50-pack and then get the Martial Arts 20-Movie Pack, which overlaps the 50-pack by only a couple of movies."
2,Crappy,These movies are terrible quality chinese kung-fu. They make you laugh because they are so terribly dubbed. The sound effects and over all quality of these movies are terrible. Buy some real kung-fu movies and don't waste your time on this.
5,"A Curiosity, Yet One of Willie's Best","Admittedly, I haven't heard everything in Willie's huge cataloge. But listening to this, I'm struck by how strong his voice was in the early '60s when these seminal tunes were cut. These are all wonderful genre-bending songs, relaxed, down and full of soul, with Willie's trademark, just-behind-the-beat vocal phrasing, the kind of thing jazz singers have long done. Accompaniments are generally just right, spare, bluesy and loose. Nothing here is dated. If you're a ""Stardust"" fan or a newcomer to Willie, you'll be greatly surprised by just how right this collection sounds. Pick it up, by all means. It's a total classic glimpse of, yes, a genius just starting out, but sounding like he's got the wisdom of an old man."
3,Decent book,I liked the book mostly because of all the new Crystal Psionic Devices. It adds so much to a world like Palladiums. I think that the 2nd edition will bring it up to date.
5,nothing,"You really just have to appreciate the passion with which people hate this band. You tend to see that, I guess, whenever some modicum of conviction is being displayed, on any front, and I guess that is to say you just don't see enough people freaking out about the state of the music being made today. Because if you did see actual content in songs, maybe a whole lot more people would be upset. But who could say, really?This record is pretty rad, on any front, whether it's the cover art, displaying the band in mock-portraits of a Gap ad (which people will no doubt marvel at and wonder, isn't that dude on that gap commercial) or songs about bugs and sex. But it's worth checking out, even if you're only going to get mad and write a negative review about."
3,Uneven,"This album had the potential to be amazing. Several songs are indeed great, particularly Insect Incest amd the more straight forward rock tracks. Others attempt to be too ""weird"" and fall flat, in particular the borderline-black metal assault of screams and keyboards which close side one (of the LP). The cover of the album is particularly scary. It's hard to believe that Al from Hellbender is in this band; they sound nothing like them at all."
4,Grease in a can,"White grease in a can that can be sprayed on items without creating a huge mess.Holds up very well in tuff weather conditions, like wind driven rain and snow.Cleans up well if you do make a mess."
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCTION RUN,"I found this movie to be enjoyable, UNTIL I got to the LAST CHAPTER: The movie STOPPED 3/4 of the way through the Last Chapter.I sent the DVD back to Amazon, and promptly received another DVD.The REPLACEMENT DVD was also DEFECTIVE, performing in the same manner.Amazon should have some type of QUALITY CONTROL for their products.I am VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!"
3,"Weak re-do of ""Running Man""","Quite simply, a good way to kill an hour and 1/2 on a rainy day, otherwise not much to recommend it. Just the usual one man against an army of evil guys, who has to run the gauntlet to save his beloved (a fine Torri Higginson), and gets a couple of folks who help him killed in he process. Ho hum. If you like Roddy Piper's pecs, add half a star."
5,The Best of the Old,"Undoubtably the best RPG ever released for 16 bit console systems in the US, Lunar 2 rereleased on the PSX might not be able to match the newer Final Fantasy games for graphics, but it is a blast to play. Capitalizing on a great battle system, where every character is useful depending on the situation or play style, it hooks you, even if you are just running around gaining levels. The story, too, is top notch. The cutscenes are short and far between, but when it was made, cutscenes were a rarity unless you owned a Sega-CD. The music is excellent, with CD quality tracks and even singing at some parts, predating the legendary Sephiroth Choir by years and years. Nobuo Uematsu could only dream of composing a score this great. The best part of the game: when you beat it, it isn't over, as the epilogue is around 10+ hours long. All in all I'd estimate about 70 hours of gameplay if you try to do and see everything."
5,greast game in the world,this game is the best I ever played.At the end I cried!When everworking designs are making LUNAR:3 Iam going to buy it!
5,This is so good it's beyond a game!!!,"This ""game"" is my life! it is not sweet.... ITZ PHAT, PHATTY McPHAT!!!!!! I love this piece... MASTAPIECE, YO!!! Okay I only have everything (including Bronidens) armour an weapons and seals and items and it only took me.... 3 days to get. I bought it the day it came out. ...."
2,"This is one of ""the the"" worst games ever","First off, I'd like to defend Ethan Knight against empire03's attack on his error in spelling ""advice"". We all make mistakes, so has empire03 (i.e. this is a selection from his review: ""I have the Sega CD version, but I would replace it the the PSX version in a heartbeat."" I think you only need to write ""the"" once, my friend.) Now, on to the game. This is the kind of game you would enjoy if you've never played a video game in your entire life. Otherwise, this game is very lacking and will probably bore the slime out of people who have played games far greater than this. I'm not dissing the graphics or the fact that this game is old (age matters not), no the problem with this game is that the story is unoriginal and the battles, while avoidible, are quite possibly the most boring, repetitive, and just unfun in the history of RPG's. So, take Mr. Knight's and my ""advice"", stay away from this."
5,Sick old school,"I had this game way back in the day on the Sega CD Rom. I did like the first one better, but this is one sick game. The story is more in depth than the first one, and the characters backgrounds are much more developed. This is one of the best RPG's ever made and I think it blows Final Fantasy 8 away and is almost as good as ff7. This game is well worth the money because I have beat this game several times and I still have fun doing it, and I usually hate going through a game the second time."
4,...Wow...great game,"I just got my copy of Lunar 2: Eternal Blue today (12/24/00), an man is it great. Is i am writing this review i am about 4 hours into the game. And already i have see so many anime cuts it's crazy. Some of the places i've been are long, like in the Blue Spire, it's just a really big place. And it's even kind of hard to get to the top of it. Now i'm not big on writing online review so i'll end with two last things, this is a great game and all RPers should own it, and damn is Lucia hot,...Althene in this game has nothing on her."
4,The Working designs Graphic Fad!,This is a very fun rpg I recommend it for Final Fantasy fans.Also if you have played the game Vanguard Bandits you would like this. It is a thrilling rpg with an exellent plot. It you are critical about graphics you might as well get another game because the graphics suck ten times over. It is a good game in all the other areas though.
1,Have the vinyl-looking for the CD,"I have the vinyl of this album, bought it new, still sounds good, since I still have a turntable.I bought it at EJ Kovettes on Long Island. Not only that, but Herb and Hugh were there and signed the record cover.Would love to get it on CD, but not sure how much I would pay, the Amazon used price seems high for a used copy.But I am tempted."
5,Peace of mind for this girl,"I'm writing this review because I came back to order a second one of these holders, and found myself very surprised at the negative reviews. Well, sometimes, the suction cup doesn't work perfectly, BUT I find that I don't really need it. I've been moving the one I have back and forth between the kitchen and the bathroom (which is why I'm ordering a 2nd one), and it stays upright, and the magnet is strong enough not to budge even if it was to fall over.Overall, I looked at A TON of ring holders, and this great magnet ""closure"" design is by far the best. I have to admit that I am the kind of person who loses her glasses every half hour, but this little thing makes me a lot more confident about where I'll find my ring."
3,It's ok...,"I bought this because it has a suction cup on the bottom and i thought that it would stick to the counter. It does sometimes and not others. It does hold my rings and if it does get pushed over i don't have to worry about them going anywhere. I am a little upset that it doesn't ALWAYS stick though. You know it only does when you don't need it to, but when you do need it to it doesn't. Oh well... I bought it and it works ok... I will keep it... But if i had to, i wouldn't buy it again!"
1,Slim Jim Orig Mt Snk Canister,You can purchase these at Target for like $2.50 A box of 12 would cost appx. $30Which is $25 less than Amazon AND you don't have to buy a box.....single price quantity. Do the math ;>)
1,NOT RECEIVED,"I wih I could make a review on this item, however I have never recieved it. I spent $20 approx. and I ordered it in June however July is nealy finsihed and I didnt received yet. I knew and I had to wait a bit longer because it was shipped from USA but I think that one month and a half is too much."
1,"Lovely, but mine already broke","It IS beautiful and heavy. However, mine is already broken. I got it not less than a week, and the TINY THIN chain holder (the small ring on top of the piece that holds the chain), for some reason, broke. I got so angry I threw the thing away.It's not very strong."
4,One of the better SF DJ's,"As a former Wicked, Come-Unity and SF Area party scene goer, Jenö is probably my favorite of all the Bay Area DJs. The way he progams his sets, the way he perfectly blends them together makes me just smile and realize how good he is. The least (most) common denominator of all his music is the soul...you can definitely sense it. This CD is no exception...the mixing is perfect, the programming just right. The only problem i have with this is the media itself...A single CD causes him, in my opinion, to cut short some of the songs due to the limited space.No matter what, this is a quality DJ and i wish everyone gets a chance to hear his work. Also, if you get a chance to get his tapes such as We Are Phuture, Inside the Mind, and my favorite, Bang The Drum...get it! Music that i can listen to forever."
1,don't buy,if you want the original songs as they were played on the radio then don't buy this cd or you will be disappointed as i was
4,Good basic info,"I don't know anything about body repair. This book has good basic info and techniques, presented in an easy-to-understand way."
3,$1000 for a stuffed animal?,"My son has several webkinz, and all of them are only worth maybe 200 USD. But 1000 Dollars for 1 Webkinz? I think they are being a little too greedy here...."
4,It Is awesome but the price is a ripoff,WHY IS A DARN LITTLE PLUSH ANIMAL ALMOST 1000 BUCKS? I MEAN COME ON I COULD BUY ALL THE OTHER WEBKINZ WITH THAT MONEY
3,Insanely Expensive!,Who the heck would pay this much for a webkinz. My friend has the same one and she bought it for $14.95!
1,You have GOT to be kidding.,"Seriously? Charging that much for a stuffed toy just because it's ""retired"" and (for some unknown reason--the thing is hideous) popular? I love webkinz just as much as the next fan but this is ridiculous! Paying 700 dollars for one that isn't even cute (seriously, look at that face. It's ugly.) is insane. Even if it was one of the cuter ones or even the higher quality Signature pets, paying so much for a stuffed animal is ludicrous. Do people actually buy these for that much? You can get one with the same face (but different colors) for WAY less than this one."
5,Most fun I ever had,I have had a blast with this ball. i play with my 5 and 7 year old in the back yard and the ball was everything and more than I anticipated. It was easily filled with air after i called customer service for assistance and they were most helpful.
2,Review of Complete Rottweiler,This book was not what I thought it was going to be. It targets want-to-be breeders and show dogs; I didn't find it very informative for the average family dog.
1,"Look carefully, you need an ACTIVE PS/2 to USB converter","The keyboard looks nice and the price had seemed terrific, however the price started climbing. It needs a converter to be used with a Dell. The standard passive PS/2 to USB converter won't work. Trying to decide if I should ship it back to Amazon or spend another 15.00 on an active converter."
5,A carnival on paper,"I stumbled across this book as a child and was simultaneously terrified and fascinated. It's been nearly twenty years, yet I still remember the prematurely aged child, the bullfighter being smothered with roses, and David Lang walking off into nowhere. A wonderful, traumatizing book."
1,"Blah, Blah and Blah","The book starts out okay and has somewhat of an interesting storyline, but the resolutions are totally unrealistic and oversimplified. Not worth reading and not an erotic novel. A very bad try at copying ""Desperate Housewives."""
1,A Star Trek The Original Series Novel in name only,"If you are looking for a Kirk and Company Original Series Novel, this one is not for you. This novel like many of the other Star Trek Novels recently published use the Star Trek characters to introduce a new set of Characters and the characters we loved are only a small part of the story. The description of this story does not indicate Kirk and Company are not the primary characters. Once more I was sucked into buying a Star Trek novel which has nothing to do with the Characters I wanted to read about. In the future I will check out the book at the local bookstore before purchasing so I can get a better idea of the books contents."
2,What happened to Star Trek?!,"Very disappointing. A great premise for the story but sadly let down by an incredibly slow delivery. Half-way through the book before anything actually happens.As usual David Mack tries to tell too many stories at the same time and leaves the reader in a constant state of flux as he jumps from scene to scene. Some parts were soooo boring I barely skim read them.Most readers will buy a Star Trek book because they like a sci-fi action story with a touch of human interest. This comes more under the category of a romance/drama with a touch of action so that the reader doesn't fall asleep. He did much better with hisStar Trek: Destiny: Gods of Nightseries, but even then there were far too many plot lines being woven together resulting in a very disjointed read."
3,"Good, but not great...","'Star Trek: Vanguard' was good, but not great. I must admit, I enjoy Peter David and Diane Carey more. I very much enjoyed the Genesis series by John Vornholt. Harbinger was interesting, not very exciting. It was more character driven, which is sometimes a welcome change. I could have done without the gay Vulcan, but in an age of political correctness, it's obviously to be expected. I've started the second book in the series. Maybe it will pick up the pace."
1,Very slow moving,"I have been reading Star Trek for 23 years and the Vangard Series is well...Poorly done. It is very poorly edited and a very slow read. The plot is disjointed and bounces around not connecting the story archs by giving you good clues to why a plot thread is being explored until the very end. Good reads tease you along and so far the new releases are not holding up. Vanguard does not pull together. This is only the second time I have not been able to finish a Star Trek book. I am now going to check them out of the Library first. Now many are give this series a 5 star yet not saying how long they have been reading Star Trek books so they may not have read but just the last 10 years or so. Now the premise is ok but the story needs to be refined. The new enemy is well, old concept stuff.If you want to compare the earlier books try reading Uhura's Song or The Vulcan Science Academy Murders."
4,Good Book,"It's a good book, has an entertaining story, is an easy read, and I'm hoping to finish this book to Read next one"
5,the dvd,A few details on the dvd that I didnt see listed here. It's a 6 disc set and is the complete season and runs 604 mins.
3,Hard to hear,"I love the rugrats & so do my kids. movie is great, however, the sound is not loud enough to hear!"
2,Just fine,I love the Rugrats but you need to wash in HD cause on SD look really bad is like you watching VHS tapes
4,Not bad for a DVD-R,This was my favorite season of Rugrats. I laughed a lot. Picture quality is good and so is the sound quality.
3,Not the Best,I was hoping to find a nice heavy dust pan that had a good tight contact with the floor. I was hoping the Rubbermaid name would assure this quality. It wasn't what I had hoped for. This is not a heavy weight pan.
4,1970's South Austraia,"I thought it was an excellent movie and caught the racist tones of 1970's outback Australia accurately. I worked a summer job in Nundroo in late 1977 when I was a Uni student in Melbourne - Nundroo in South Australia was a roadhouse near the coast, between Ceduna and Nullarbor, on the edge of the Yatala aboriginal reserve. The attitudes of the local whites were very much as captured in this film. They were generally bigotted - simple as that - and not too worldly or educated, norinterested in hearing other viewpoints !The American review below is so wide of the mark. Their loss !"
1,Don't bother,"An official selection of the 2002 Sundance Film Festival, based on a novel that won a pile of awards, and it looks promising in the blurb. It's about a 16-year-old white footie player who writes (or at least reads a dictionary in the dunny) and who falls for an Aboriginal girl. The film starts out looking like an after-school special but then descends into exploring the dark side of racism.Perhaps. Or maybe it's just a bag of stereotypes, sad overdone melodrama that would shame the soapies, and a ""gritty"" plot that suckered some folks into believing it was sincere.It preceded CRASH by about 5 years but was, I think, every bit as bogus. I could be wrong, since I'm American, but I just don't think the writing was fair dinkum. I think the fine folks at Sundance got suckered by the first Aussie movie they'd ever seen that didn't star Paul Hogan. Ninety minutes that seemed much longer."
3,a real sleeper,"this book was a real disappointment. after i read the wonder woman book and loved it i ran out and bought this one thinking that the story would be well written and worth reading. wrong!!!it starts off with a pyramid being found in all places gotham city. after this strange events start happening that threatens the safety of the whole world. when the superfriends go and investigate, they find that they got more than they bargained for.now this book has brillant ideals that never get going far. it is written more like an outline where the author forgot to put in the interesting details. it is sad that this book never went anywhere because it might discourge people from reading other justice league books that might actually be well written."
2,Not Grant's best work,"Alan Grant phoned this one in. A simple story told in an uninteresting way. I kept reading thinking it would get better, it didn't. Glad I only paid 99 cents for it."
3,Super Reader,"One of the weaker novels in the JLA cycle. There are other Batman novels you can get before this one, unless you are getting this whole series. An enjoyable little add-in at the end though."
5,Batman saves the League,"For those of who have read my other reviews on Batman novels, you should know I'm a huge Batman fan. So when I heard about a new series that involved The Justice League of America, I was interested. Then I found that the first book in the series would involve Batman as the main charcter in a worldwide crisis. This was the first novel I've ever read that involved Batman.This is a must-own for JLA fans or Batman fans.PARTY ON,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,A Good Start For The Series,"A genial enough start to a series of paperbacks focusing on the JLA. While not exceptional, it has the sense of wonder that the JLA always filled my childhood with. It's primary focis is, as you would expect,it tells the story from the POV of Batman. He does come across as a bit too perfect to be human, but then he always did to me. I suspect that this is what keeps this title from getting a higher rating. Recommanded."
1,Four hours of my life that I will never get back,"Well, that's one of the dumbest books I've ever read. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but this requires suspension of intellect, and all scientific knowledge. Most of the book and explanations sound like the drunken dream of a schizophrenic. Lets see - the book breaks just about every science known to man. From archeology to physics, from geology to plain common sense. OK, spoiler time - I am now going to save you four hours of reading this complete drivel. The ghost of a neolithic barbarian tries to destroy all civilization by harnessing electromagnetic forces of the planet. Batman stops him. The end.All in a day's work for the Ghostbusters, but Batman is nearly killed because he is very un-batman like here. Plus the giant bad guy doesn't leave enormous chunks of marshmallows after he dies!"
4,Solid general history on the topic,"Most books on Mexican jewelry focus on contemporary silver jewelry or vintage jewelry made in Taxco, the strength of this book is that it also covers less well known Mexican jewelry making traditions. There is information about jewelry made in Patzcuaro, Oaxaca, Toluca, Chiapas, Guerrero etc as well as information about pre-columbian jewelry and European / Spanish inspired jewelry from 16th to 18th centuries. There is also an entire chapter devoted to religious jewelry as well. Unfortunately, the illustrations are in black and white - however, given the sparseness of information about most regional Mexican jewelry, any reproductions are valuable to those interested in this topic."
2,The information in this book is too dated,"I don't understand why people are giving this book such good reviews. This particular version of the book was published in 1982, but the first publication, with same information, was in 1963. This book is useless to me. The photos aren't even very good - extremely dated. I didn't want information on Mexican jewelry artists from 1963, I wanted much more current information including hallmarks. Adding the fact that I received a library book copy of this in poor condition which wasn't mentioned in the listing for $11, it was a complete waste of my money."
4,a truly accomplished piece of work,"Much of the hits by abba were written by the 2 boys (benny and bjorn),little is known about the songwriting ability of agnetha. the first track off the album is her very first single and her very first hit. nearly all of the songs are written by her. for the abba completist, there's the swedish version of s.o.s. sadly, this is also her last original album for the (swedish) columbia label"
4,Agnetha,"I really loved this CD, Agnetha has such a beautiful voice, even though it is in Swedish, it is still enjoyable, I like the Swedish version of I Don't know how to love him and SOS, also the one I enjoyed most is Nar du tar mej I din Famn, this song really grew on me."
4,Song bird,"It's never ABBA, but it's still Agnetha. I love her voice, and if you do, you'll find songs that make you wish you could hear her sing every day of your life."
1,Buy it only if you know Hindi,"Srimad Bhagavad Gita is my most favorite book. The DVD is actually a fairly good introduction to the Gita. The english subtiles, however, are horrific! It was very clear to me that the translators had little comprehension of the theology of the Gita. In addition, the translators demonstrated that they are unfamiliar with the english language. If you do not understand Hindi, do not buy it."
5,hysterical...loved it,"i thought this book was hilarious. at first i wondered if the whole book was a sham, a mockumentary like one of those christopher guest films (best in show, this is spinal tap). but it's all real, almost frighteningly so at times. the characters were great, and the inside scoop on this esoteric american subculture was highly amusing. and i just found out you can see the author's appearance on the daily show...funny...check it out...[...]"
2,Not as good as NES version,"Toobin' for the Gameboy pales in comparison to the version that was released years earlier for the basic Nintendo system, believe it or not.The graphics in that version were better, but more importantly, the controls were better. It's nearly impossible to control this version, which is very frustrating in a game that's all about steering and throwing things.It would be nice if someone would release a good version of Toobin' for Gameboy Advance; but this isn't it."
5,Plan to B surprised!,"The movie starts very slow; be patient because in the end, it is a well thought out movies with a romantic ending."
2,Very Slow Saga on Relationships,"I was actually a bit surprised to see the number of 4 and 5 star ratings for this film. It's not a bad film at all, just remarkably slow. I really found myself unable to connect with any of the characters, particularly the main two. Acting was good, but I kept waiting for something to happen - a conversation, an argument, anything. When it did, we were two-thirds of the way through the film, and my interest had long since faded.The film techniques used, while artistic, made an already slow film even slower. At times, the directors would cast the audience to watch a scene with nothing happening. I understand this was designed to move or inspire thought maybe, but without any connection to the characters or plot, it just made the agony longer.I have seen many 4 and 5 star rated foreign films, but this was not one of them. On the same evening, after this film, I watched another foreign film (this one in English),Kawa. Fortunately, my night in turn ended with a good film."
3,plan b,i would have to say that this movie did start off kinda slow and i was at so many points in the film tempted to turn it off but in the end it turned out pretty good. i i think the fact that its in subtitles and there are many points in which the character rs are not really engaging in dialogue that contributes to many times where it seems to be dragging along in order to fill out time slots.
3,Could have been better,"I agree with other reviews that said this film moved at glacial speed; however, that did not bother me. What did bother me was the real lack of a cohesive plot. The chemistry between Bruno and Pablo was wonderful and should have been played up. The lack of dialogue (except for the awesome ""toys"" scene) dragged down the movie. I felt it was like watching a bad version of extreme gay chicken at a frat party until the end. Plus I wanted more backstory on Pablo and Bruno. Where did they work? What was their family situation? All I got from the film was that Bruno was an unemployed actor. (Prior to that I thought both men were impoverished students). Also, the ending? A total let-down. All that build up and na-da.Overall, there were parts I liked, but those parts were outweighed by the negatives."
5,Absolutely loved this movie,"I'm almost intimidated to write a review since the other reviewers have done a tremendous job of conveying the eloquence of this movie. I'll just offer my two cents.I did not expect to be as moved and captivated by this movie as I was. Many others have discussed the powerful silences in this movie and I have to agree that, those, in addition to the actors' incredible skills of conveying a variety of emotions without saying a word, made this movie dynamic. It was very believable and not rushed. It was refreshing to see the uncertainty, angst and anguish over what was inevitably happening to them played out at length and not cheapened by the directors desire to bed them early on or rush them to a predictable happy ending.I highly respect directors and actors who are courageous enough to involve themselves with projects like this and exposing themselves to ridicule. Thank you for this movie. It was pure and an absolute joy to watch."
5,Charming,"It's an attractive and unique idea. Very seductive, even in the most slow moments. Loved it.Both of the actors are terrific. Besides, it has a happy ending!"
5,The dialogue is in the eyes,"The dialogue is in the eyes. If you can read that, the quietness of this film is filled with ten volumes of speach. A 'must see' for the aware!"
3,An honest film that shows there are shades of gray between the black and white (3-1/2 stars),"About a very jealous man who, determined to break up his ex and her new boyfriend, learns that the new boyfriend once had a one-time dalliance with another guy ... which is when his ""plan B"" becomes to get to know, and flirt like hell with, the new boyfriend instead, behind the ex's back. When he starts to actually have romantic and sexual feelings for the other guy, however, the whole plan travels down a road he's not sure he's prepared to follow. My description's weak, but the emotional content of this film packs a wallop; it's slower paced, but that allows you to keep up with both men, their growing attraction, and their humongous resistance to it - all at the same time. Well-done."
2,Handy but flawed,"The front edge of this dustpan has no lip so that some of the swept-up items fly under the edge and back onto the floor, instead of into the dustpan."
3,Sturdy design but a couple of annoying features,"This dustpan is sturdy and well balanced, and will hold a lot of stuff. The opening is wide enough to use a Swiffer pad to sweep things into the dustpan, but as another reviewer stated, the lip is not well designed -- fine particles, small nails, etc. tend to go under the edge instead of inside where they belong. A damp Swiffer pad generally picks up what doesn't get swept into the dustpan.The other minor annoyance with this product is that the handle will not stay tightly screwed in, no matter how hard I cinch it down. Maybe it's because I'm left-handed, but it's still a nuisance. A few drops of Gorilla Glue on the threads did the trick to keep the handle permanently tightened to the dustpan.Despite these problems, I liked the first one well enough to purchase a second -- now I have one for the house and one for the garage."
1,Lousy!,"I purchased this item WITH a handle and the item arrived without the handle. I'm very disappointed, and attempted to return it without success. This item should be avoided!"
1,Serious Omissions,"Serious omissions and poor search capabilities severely cripple this CD-Rom's usefulness for any serious genealogical research. Most of the Amish from the Berks County settlement are not included. Among those left out are Jacob Hertzler, first Amish Bishop in America, Johannes Lantz, and many of the early Yoder settlers. There is no search feature available because most of the CD is nothing more than web pages. There is an ebook included which requires a Windows operating system and the Microsoft ebook reader. The web pages can be read by persons with Macs; however, PC emulation software would be a necessity to view the ebook. Skip this CD and wait for the second edition of Gingerich and Kreider's Amish and Amish Mennonite Genealogies."
3,state of affairs for india,This book is the state of affairs for whats happening in India currently(2006) and concludes with a discussion of world affairs and the relationship of India to the world. A very intersesting discussion is presented about outsourcing to India.
5,"Clarity, Depth, Detail and Style Up the Wazoo","A B S O L U T E L Y ~ A M A Z I N GThis book is first and foremost a case study of the ""civil war"" being waged against many Indian citizens by their own government, in the name of development. Asside from that, this book is also a work of art. A gifted writer and profound thinker who has taken up the pen for the sake of social justice. If you can't afford it, write me and I'll loan you my copy!"
3,Poorly written - but a start,"I have this book. There's not much literature around about Delphi 6 yet, so this is better than nothing. It contains a lot of information, however it appears to have been written in a hurry - it is very poorly put together. I have just been following the WebSnap chapter examples through, and the steps aren't in the correct order, some are repeated, and are not specific. Incorrect component names are referred to etc etc. It's just as well I have some experience and can work it out and see the errors. Definitely not recommended for anyone with little Delphi or Web Application experience."
1,Save your money,"I have the Developers Guide for D2,D4 and D6. D2 Guide was the most imformative. Since then the books have been only for newbies. For someone writing an application, the book doesn't do anything to help resolve a coding problem. The only help I have gotten from it was the usage of bookmarks. I have jumped into it a number of time, but came out everytime with a zero."
1,Save Your Money!!!,"This costume looks very cute on the picture, but when you buy it and get it, it is thin and see through, the hat comes floppy, and doesnt shape like the one in the picture. Definately not worth the price, Looks like it was made for 10 cents. Save your money."
1,Low rating because of typo in savings,"According to Amazon, this item is on sale at a whopping savings of over sixty one THOUSAND dollars! The one star rating is for Amazon, not the product. I sincerely hope that statistics from this product do not go into some sort of stockholder or public relations report that makes Amazon seem to offer deeper discounts than they really do."
4,Easy to Clean Mop Head,"You can clean a lot of square footage with this mop head. When you are done, throw it in the washing machine and reuse it. It's that simple."
2,White pave Cubic Zirconia Belt Buckle Ring,"Design is lovely. Bold with lots of sparkle. The down side is, it's starting to lose it's finish. I've tried cleaning it to no avail. If it gets much worse, it will be time for the garbage can."
2,Disappointing,"I am disappointed with this book...I didn't think that it was another ""block"" book.. too bad..."
5,My favorite quilt book!,"Page after page of simple-to-make quilt blocks based on strips, squares and right triangles (half squares). Strong, graphic patterns would look equally great in contemporary or country interiors; many would also adapt well to garments. Not a lot wasted on basic instruction (if you need that, look elsewhere) but plenty of inspiration. Shows you how to use graph paper to develop your own ideas and design variations."
4,A great book for designing beautiful but practical quilts,"Although the writing style is a little hard to follow at times, and I wish there were clearer and more complete instructions, I would recommend this book highly to anyone who knows a little bit about quilting already.With dozens of quilt block variations, all of them made from squares and triangles, you can make literally hundreds of quilts without ever needing another book. Hopkins also gives you a few basic design principles and starts you out with a couple of easy projects. This is a great book!"
1,Bad Penny folder,"I picked this up along with several other Whitman coin folders. This is the worst of them all, I had to re-order as the holes were too small, the replacement was actually worst than the original, it had tears on it as if someone already tried inserting coins in the holes and failed! It was impossible to insert the Pennies with your fingers, you would need another tool to insert the coin.Overall, I think Whitman failed with this folder 1959-1998. I got other Lincoln cents folders from different year sets and the pennies fit just fine. I suggest skip this year set because Whitman has 2 other folders that work great."
2,not worth the money,Save your money.This book merely re-states the obvious. Expected more real information and not more the obvious. Did not need to purchase this book. Oh well - money NOT well spent.
3,Canine Hardware travel dog bed--not so great,"Sturdy, easy to wash, but not very soft or stuffed. Still looking for a thick, machine-washable large bed that doesn't bunch up and isn't expensive. Sorry, this isn't it."
5,Guide Dog Approved,"This was a gift to my blind dad for his guide dog, 56 lb lab. Since they do much traveling, I thought the dog could use a more comfortable bed when they are not home. It has only been a week and she loves it! My dad called me today to thank me again for this gift because she goes straight to the bed which is set up in his office at home, bypassing her other beds."
5,Just Right,Perfect for an aussie stay in his canine hotel (Citizen Canine) when we are on the road. Looks capable of surviving washings as well.
3,Size?,"I thought this would be smaller in its compact travel case. It was much larger than I was expecting, but still appears to be a great travel bed."
3,A Little Thinner Than Expected,"Looking at the picture again, I guess I should have realized how thin it was, but I didn't. It had good reviews and the pictures of dogs sleeping on it made me think it was better than it was. All it really needs is a little more padding.It is attractive and appears to be well-made. I haven't washed it yet, so I don't know how well it will hold up in the washing machine, but I like that sections are sewn together to prevent the material shifting.Again, my only complaint (for the price), is it could use a little more stuffing. Our cat loves it, though."
5,Best Dog Bed Ever...,"Our Russian German Shepard Loves her new bed. we left the old one and the new one on the floor for her to choose and she never went back to the old one! Great reviews, all true to what I can see so far. Beware though, there are different sellers on Amazon that sell this product for different prices... Do your homework... :)"
2,Dead Season,"Elvis and Tweeter think they've found hope off the coast of Florida, but they soon find themselves trapped on an island that is swarming with the undead! Brace yourself for more of the same tired cliches in the new zombie survival film DEAD SEASON, Adam Deyoe's fifth feature film following other such classics as PSYCHO SLEEPOVER and YETI: A LOVE STORY. The bore-o-meter is reading surprisingly high in Florida during this year's DEAD SEASON, with the only thing duller than the characters being the dreadful dialog that accompanies them. Cinematography Jeffrey Peters seems unusually obsessed with keeping everything tight in frame, filming nearly every shot in an unnecessary close-up. Credit is due to the film's make-up team for sticking strictly to practical effects, but the zombie action is infrequent at best, and hardly worth the wait. Everyone has their favorite season, but DEAD SEASON comes in dead last on that list.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
2,DEAD is a correct tittle,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ poor everything as far a Zombie movie goes ZZZ ZZZZ ZZZ ZZZ ZZZ ZZZ ZZZ ZZZ ZZZ ZZZ ZZZ ZZZ
3,dead season has blood,This zombie movie has a basic story with lots of blood and body parts.. its actually makes a little sense if you did leave the main land behind and went to island.
2,Dissapointing movie,Being a big fan of zombie movies I thought I'd give this a try. It was ok but I couldn't get through the whole movie. There was just no interest in the lame plot or the unexciting characters.
2,"Disjointed, rehashed and dull!","I had hoped that this movie would be a 'hidden gem' like 'The Dead' was by The Ford Brothers but this movie never got off the ground. I didn't even find this mildly entertaining, or interesting, as I did with 'Abe Lincoln vs Zombies.' It was flat, like warm beer or soda. If you like it, GREAT but I hope that I've saved most of you a wasted rental fee!"
2,Not bad but pretty close to it,"Almost the moment they got to the island I already knew the ""big secret"". Talk about a whole move of transference. Zombies are eating you so you might as well join the crowd. Note to self: NEVER go to a remote island if zombies take over the world. Like Romero didn't already cover that grand idea. And secondary note to self: if you come upon a ""community"" of survivors and they are militant, run away screaming NAKED into the night because that would at least be a fun way to die. I don't think I can EVER eat beef jerky again folks. enjoy. ;)"
2,B british film,"B film that should only be on Scyfy channel. Not the worst film ever, but seems very abridged, and the acting is subpar, except for the antagonist character, he was good and has a career ahead of him."
2,Terrible!!!,"This was not good at all. I would have turned if off if I had not paid my money for it. Not very good acting at all, very slow moving and honestly, just plain boring. I would not agree at all with those who rated it a 4 star or 5 star. Don't waste your money or your time.If you have not watched the TV series Walking Dead, you are really missing a zombie movie that is very well written and well done. I was surprised myself."
5,Fantastic San Francisco History....,"This book is a hybrid between a history book and a guide book. Each chapter historically chronicles a meaningful period of time betweensignificant milestones (i.e. the goldrush of 1849 or the earthquake of 1906). Following each chapter is a guide to monuments, landmarks, and musuems that have items pertaining to the preceding information.There is a fair amount of illustrations and photographs and the writing style of Rand Richards is very readable. I highly recommend this book to anybody living in or planning to visit the San Francisco bay area."
3,what the heck happened to the 70s & 80s?,"while this is a very concise history of the city, with a lot of material packed into relatively few pages, I find it extremely odd that the author skips from The Summer of Love in the late 1960s all the way to the earthquake of 1989. One has to ask, what informed the author's choice to ignore twenty years of history? Did the murder of mayor George Moscone and supervisor Harvey Milk by Dan White never happen? Did the gay civil rights movement and the development of The Castro neighborhood into the most visible gay community in the world not happen? This seems an irresponsible omission on the part of the author. What a shame."
5,Bringing history alive,"Historic San Francisco is written in a light, entertaining style that makes history enjoyable. Richards hits a wide range to topics that relate back to San Francisco as it is today, offering an opportunity for readers to create their own tour and see the locations being discussed. The book is not intended to be comprehensive but rather, covers what I see as some of the best facets of the city. Accurate and well illustrated, Historic San Francisco ranks among the best of the large number of books I own on San Francisco's history. It's a must-buy for San Franciscophiles."
5,speedy delivery!,thanks! i received the book in great condition only one day after placing my order!
2,Good for a giggle,Bought this for my husband for Christmas. He said that it is not the type of CD you listen to more than once.
5,"Sublime songs and ""son"".","Marisela Verena's moving lyrics coupled with cuban rhythms is enough to make you wanna dance, sing and cry at the same time. (I am Cuban, of course)."
3,it Ali so its good,"I was trying to track down this cd for a year, its not an audiobook so dont let them charge you that extra shipping dollar, but anyways its good but its stuff that you've heard before if you are a true Muhammad Ali fan and seeker."
4,great overview and introduction,"This is the man who almost singlehandedly invented the Bakersfield sound. If you haven't listened to Buck before, this is the place to start, as it covers his earliest raw cuts, some with Rose Maddox, into the Dwight Yoakam-inspired revival. Full of fiddles and steel guitar but also full of raunchy rock-stylings of the late Don Rich on guitar. If all you know of Buck is from the hokey overall-tinged Hee Haw spots, listen to this before you decide."
4,Buck You will always be with us!,"Where do we start,Buck will always be missed by us.A great human being, A major influence on the bakersfield style and the country music industry.A Songwriter like no other, and ofcourse Hee Haw was a great success due to him and to Roy Clark.Now regarding the boxset, I really enjoyed it. 3CDs are packed with hits that will surely entertain you.But, please note that the boxset has missed a number of amazing songs. So, please don't overlook buying the boxset, but also purchase:1. The Carnegie Hall Concert by Owens, Buck .2. In Japan!.3. Buck Owens sings Harlan Howard.4. In London [LIVE]These 4 titles are what come to mind.Thanks & enjoy,Nawaf"
5,Buck Owens Collection 1959-1990,"This will take you back to the fun years, when country music was still country. I have yearned for years to have such a set on CD, our record player doesn't work anymore. Wow! when I started searching for CD's to replace LP's of all of my Country-Western music. These are the best, they sound just like the records, only better. If you are looking to get CD's to replace your records, this is your best bet."
4,Original Artists and Hits - Here Is the Track List,1. Little Miss Can't Be Wrong - Spin Doctors2. Lump - Presidents of the U.S. of A.3. Rush - Big Audio Dynamite II4. Oh Girl - Paul Young5.

2,Uninspired photography,The brown sepia tone look of these photos tend to make the pug features blurred. The essence of the pug is the improv; these staged shots (except for the pug in the wig) lack energy. A disappointing collection.
3,"Cute, but contrived","As a major pug fan, I expected to be blown off my feet by a professional photographers take on all things ""Puggy""...what I found was a book with a great cover shot and a somewhat dissapointing inside...The pugs seemed to be plopped into odd, un-natural settings. Cute? yes. A must have?, No."
2,So so--even if you love pugs,"Don't get me wrong, I adore pugs, but think about it: if these weren't photos of the cutest dog breed in extistence, would you still like it? I think I'd find the puns unfunny, many of the set-ups trite, and the book as a whole rather thin. The good thing I have to say is that it shows how well fawn pugs photograph in sepia."
1,Nauseating,"I was required to read this for my high school senior Philosophy class, and it is nauseating. Rachels hides behind the ostensibly noble endeavor of writing a book about moral philosophy, and uses it to defend homosexuality, abortion, and disregard for The Bible. He might as well title the book ""My Arguments Against Christianity,"" for that is really what it is. His skepticism when it comes to Christian faith and The Bible are only proofs that he is one of today's ""enlightened"" philosophers who is too ""intelligent"" to fall for the ridiculously simplistic beliefs of Christianity.This book is a terrible anti-Christian screed, a total waste of time, and a sorry attempt at philosophy."
1,wrong title,"This so-called textbook should have been entitled ""The Moral Philosophy of James Rachels."" It is one-sided, tendentious, and has a decidedly pro-liberal and anti-Christian subtext. For example, having introduced Utilitarianism in chapter seven, devoting a grand total of two pages to it, Rachels gratuitously gives utilitarian arguments in favor of abortion, euthanasia, and the legalization of marijuana. Why? I thought the topic was utilitarianism. The presentation is unfair. Opposing positions are dismissed with a few sentences. Clearly, Rachels's agenda is obvious. Many other examples could be cited. I have used many other ethics textbooks over the years, but this is one of the worse."
3,OK Table,"The table isn't as nice as the photo, and does not come with levelers as advertised. One of the legs broke off during assembly, but I managed to glue it together. Overall, it's not bad, just not great."
4,Not nearly grim enough,"A well-written alternative history by a science-fiction writer, this is the best of the fictionalized accounts of Operation Downfall. It skips over Operation Olympic (the invasion of Kyushu)and concentrates upon Operation Coronet (the invasion of the main island of Honshu). The emphasis upon a somewhat limited cast of characters, while necessary for dramatic effect, in a sense glosses over the horrific cost of the planned invasion of Japan. Potential American casualties were estimated at about a million, with four to ten million Japanese deaths. It is all too easy to forget that the estimated 180,000 deaths at Hiroshima and Nagasaki literally saved the lives of millions. This book paints a gory portrait of what might have been, and the horrors that the atomic bombs actually prevented."
3,"Great material, but why stop here?","I LOVED this idea. Collect all of the comics I'd never have the nickels to rub together onto a digital format for future viewing and reading. HOWEVER - this covers only the last 20 years. Even if that's the only portion you're really interested in - for just a few bucks more, you could have The Amazing Spider-Man: the Complete Collection which collects all of the comics from Lee to the present.By the way - don't make the stupid mistake I made. The original CD collection plus this does not a complete set make. You miss out on the first 19 annual issues. If you're going to read them, you're going to want to be complete (unfortunately)...Now, I'm trying to complete my (nearly) complete set again - ugh. Why do I not read these reviews?"
4,Amazing Product!,"Good quality and large collection for the price. Downside is that there is a marvel watermark in the middle of every page if you use a comic viewer on an iPad - a minor annoyance that CAN be ignored, but is annoying nonetheless. If you read the comics in Adobe Reader, there is no watermark."
5,Exactly what I hoped for,"This item was everything it said it was and more. Everything is well organized into decades, then years. The images are of normal comic page size and perfectly readable on my computer. I couldn't be happier."
4,Excellent introduction leaving one wanting more,"This slim volume explores the way that music implements the liturgical intent and, to some extent particularly with the antiphons, the way changes in liturgy are reflected by changes in music. Especially interesting is the segment on the relationship between homilectics and music.The music explored ranges from chant to 20th century - the latter more by reference than by analysis. It includes instrumental music and cantatas as well as the classic music of the Mass.One need not be a musician nor a liturgical historian to understand this book. But reading the book will help a liturgist understand the liturgical musician and the historical development of their role.Highly recommended for anyone involved in liturgical planning."
2,Needs Recalibration Quickly,"Fine for the first six weeks or so...very interesting...but now reading 3.4 after 3 beers...Like most technology hardware companies these days, the margin is in the services. $19.95 to recalibrate...Not really pleased with the purchase, as I don't see long term value for your $100. Was it worth $100 for six weeks? no."
2,Won't keep you out of jail.,"of course no one should rely on such a tester to hedge drinking and driving.If someone did, the chance of this unit and the one the cops have will match in your favor is nil. Calibration is everything and you must continually return a tester like this to the seller to maintain it's accuracy. So you need two, one in calibration and one in service. If you really want to play this dangerous game, a tester with owner changeable plug in calibration modules is the only way."
5,PERFECT,I put this on our wedding registry as a gag gift but it is so much more. Out of all our wedding gifts this little sucker has been the highlight and used everyday. It is suppose to be practical but it so much more than that!<br />I would recommend this to EVERYONE!
1,Broke the day I got it,"I got this for my 21st birthday and it never worked. It gives grossly inaccurate readings. I had 3 shots within an hour and it gave me a reading of .01 (not .1) Anyway you're supposed to wait 20 minutes after drinking before using this thing. I think that's somewhat inconvenient. Overall, I wouldn't purchase this brand again. Buyer Beware."
5,Perfect - now I need a video head!,"I just bought theManfrotto 234RC Monopod Head Quick Releaseand it fits perfectly inside the monopod's carrying case.This'll be just right for my DSLR, but now I'm looking for a light-duty pan/tilt head for myBenro A2970F Versatile Tripod with Aluminum Flip Lock Legs-- preferably, a head that uses the same Quick-Release Plates as the 234RC.My Sony DCR-SR100 Camcorder weighs only about 1.5 pounds. So if anyone has any good suggestions, I'd really appreciate it.Keep in mind, I'm looking for something that will do the trick with the Benro Tripod, AND something which uses the same Quick-Release Plates as the 234RC, this way I'll have the (quick) option of using the monopod for my DSLR, as well as for the camcorder.Happy shooting!"
4,A cautionary fable about obsession.,"Jayne, a café worker, falls in love with the ethereal, glamorous Jilaine during a chance meeting. Jayne (known as Jay) is a young, lonely, poor and a closeted lesbian. Jilaine is an artist, a published author and the daughter of a semi-famous painter. Jay's feelings for Jilaine verge on obsession and lead her to inveigle her way in Jilaine's life. She discovers that all is not as it seems.Set in London in the early 80s, this brief novel is an acute psychological thriller and a character study. It is written like a monologue, and Jay's voice-the self-loathing, the distance she places between herself and people-comes through believably. Jay is the lesbian version Highsmith's Ripley-an amoral interloper, and the plot has an interesting Ingmar Bergmanesque twist.Lee captures the crazy feel of emotional and sexual obsession in this cautionary fable."
1,What the....,"I'm trying to figure out who the morons were who came up with this album concept. I'm so tired of hip-hop and rap to start with and now this. When something is an original, you don't mess with it. Or,at least if you do, you do good with it. These guys should be ashamed,and anyone who purchases this album (knowing you can view some of it first),is not a true Def Leppard fan."
2,What the &*$#!,"1 Star? How about Negative 10 Stars ! I cannot believe that I traveled to San Fran, Vegas, Columbus OH and West Virginia and own every DL album to hear this crappy piece of SH%^. Guys, please say that it isn't so that you couldn't pass on such a horrific butchering of some of the greatest rock lyrics and guitar riffs ever known. Enough said, I'm selling off the collection. I'm not financially rich but I'm in dire need of cleansing from the noises I just listened to from this so-called tribute.Tonight, tonight...It's me and my wine. Nicklepp"
1,Atroscious,This is the worst tribute I've ever heard. You cant even hear the words that they're saying. Come On!!! Who has ever taken an album and ruined it?
1,This disaster will appeal to NO ONE!,"-ZERO STARS-...and ditto what everyone else has said!Guys, I'm a lifelong fan, but what on Earth are y'all thinking by even authorizing this blasphemous catastrophe to be recorded, let alone promoting it on your very site?! Honestly. You can NOT be serious.Leppard fans won't buy this, and neither will hip hop fans! It's total garbage from either perspective! Well, what's done is done, but your best bet now is to take the promotion of this mess off your main site. It's really not helping you guys any.Are you getting it?... Really getting it?... You won't get it from me! (or anyone else)"
1,Is this a joke?,"You must me kidding. This sounds like a kid recorded it in his basement with his friends. Please don't waste your money on this, Def Leppard deserves a lot better."
1,HORRIBLE,I gave this one star because it will not allow me to give it a negative 10 stars. This is horrible....I may never be the same after listening to the samples. You are better off taking the money you would spend on this and throwing it out of your car window. You would probably enjoy throwing your money away better than this JUNK. What a disgrace.........
3,it's not THAT bad,"granted I never thought of DL music as being hip hop worthy...but then again...why not? These songs aren't so terrible...these songs are certainly better than Lionel Richie's cover of ""long long way to go""...or that horrendous Mariah Carey cover.....plus, this tribute makes me realize how tuneworthy their songs really are... if some hip hop artists can take parts of Lep songs and make them their own in a hip hop version, then good for them...and good for the Leps too since those songs can stand up to this challenge!The thing is ... most fans of Def Leppard are not going to be hip hop fans so the two mixed together can be like oil and water...but some fans are more open to other kinds of music...and aren't opposed to this at all. This isn't the BEST hip hop I've ever heard...but it's certainly not a bad effort...and I can appreciate that DL has influenced a LOT of musicians throught out their career. and if it introduces DL to someone who would otherwise not know them, then GREAT!"
1,I'll Save You the Trouble,"I don't need to own this album to know that it sucks. Just listen to the samples. The only thing worse than this album is K-Fed. And maybe Markie Mark, but at least he gets props for making himself into an actor. I didn't think it was possible to make Def Leppard suck any harder than they do, but this album has proved me wrong."
3,Betrayal in the ashes,"Could have been a little longer and more detailed, but was just as good as the rest in the series."
1,Just Ashes,"""Betrayal"" is less strident than Mr. Johnstone's work, but it is still difficult to read. Rather than draw interesting characters, Mr. Johnstone resorts to trite stereotypes. The protaganist, Ben Raines, offers the only shred of interest in the book. Apparently, he is a brilliant military leader who enjoys risking his life in commando-style warfare behind enemy lines. Anyone who has actual combat experience knows that even the most skilled soldier can have an unluckly day (and greatly shortened life). Given the number of ""Ashes"" books on the shelf, Mr. Raines has a career only found in comic books. Overall, ""Betrayal"" was a bit better than ""Hunted"" or ""Breakdown."" My only thought is that Mr. Johnstone has found a group of people who will buy his books... no matter what he writes. If so, he is a good salesman, but I cannot possibly describe him as a good writer."
1,nukote ink roller,"CAME TO ME DRY, NO INK, BUT MERCHANT, GAVE ME A FULL REFUND, NINUS THE RETURN SHIPPING, WHICH I FEEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO ME, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER, BECAUSE OF THIS FACT, I FEEL THAT HE SHOULD HAVE REFUNNED MY SHIPPING MONEY"
5,Well done!,"I was pleasantly surprised by this DVD. The photography and editing is excellent, and the organization is logical (coverage starts in Dublin, then moves south and west, then up the west coast, etc.). I've visited Ireland three times, and the DVD covers a lot of sites/sights I'd seen on my trips, but also contains some ""new"" material. Now I want to go back!For the price this is probably the best deal if you're looking for a good overview of the sights and landscape of Ireland. If you've never been to Ireland, it will give you a good feel for the country; and if you've already visited Ireland, you can reminisce about familiar sights and places. Highly recommended!"
2,A bit dated video,"This video was not quite as current as I anticipated it being. It was OK, but not as good as others on Ireland."
2,Hook,I bought this hook to put over my cubicle at work thinking the hook would be big enough to fit over the cubicle and it did not. I still use the hook at work it just doesn't sit properly on the cubicle...lol except for that little problem it's a great product.
3,An interesting view of hamburgers...,"I enjoy reading graphic novels, and started this one eagerly. But part way into it, I found the plot lagging, the drawings flat (and somewhat gross!), and the subject matter...weird. I did like how the vegetarian got to stick up for herself, and won in the end. I also liked the overall message that humans can be compassionate. I don't think I would purchase this for myself, but check it out from your local public library!"
5,Great Buy for Pirate lovers,The flag is really cool and is awesome if you have a little boy like I do who love Pirates...........
1,Mundial warrenty is useless,"Shipped an item back to them in first week of December, finally had to call them today Jan. 22, to find out if they were going to replace or what was going on, was told that the rust on the bolt was not covered, and if I want my item back, I have to pay them to ship it back. They would need a check in advance to return the item. Consider yourself warned>"
2,ok,I am happy with their customer service. So far they have been good with handling product issues. They have so far held true to their word.
4,Handbook of North American Woods,"This may be regarded as the official handbook of North American Woods. For those interested in identifying USA-grown wood this book overlaps somewhat with Hoadley's 'Identifying Wood'. The latter is more readable with illustrations that are unorthodox but briliant.The illustrations in the 'Textbook' are quite traditional, as is the text. Of course this 'Textbook' is not primarily focused on wood identification: it is a reference work covering many aspects of North American woods. It is packed with facts: a good solid reference."
1,This is a HUGE RIPOFF!,"I can't believe that I paid $24.30 for this little booklet of mini-excerpts. When the last reviewer said that they were short, I had no idea that most of the pieces are only a page and a half. Can I get my money back? I was hoping to use these in class, but I could write my own scripts more easily than I could find a way to incorporate these literary tidbits. The title is completely misleading. This is NOT a book of Reader's Theatre for Young Adults! What a ripoff!"
3,Not what I was looking for,"I didn't realize there were 2 versions of this book. The one I thought I was ordering had a blue cover with specific recipes I wanted. The one I got had a cream colored cover and the recipes I really wanted weren't in it - specifically spritz. However, the book was in the condition it was said to be in and it was sent and delivered quickly."
2,This was my least favorite of Michelle's books.,"I think that all of Michelle Martin's books are well worth reading. Her sense of humor comes out in her snappy dialogue. I did however find it very hard to like a leading man that would still be thinking about marrying someone else up until almost the end of the book! I also could't believe that any self respecting woman would put her friends well being so much above her own. I did like how she resolved Whitney's conflict. Very surprising! Even though this wasn't my favorite of her books, I am still looking forward to her future books. She is a wonderful writer."
1,A Very Predictable Yawner,"I must admit the many comparisons to Susan Elizabeth Phillip and the movie My Best Friends Wedding intrigued me. A fan of both, all I can say is The Long Shot was a great disappointment. The backstory is about as cliched and predictable as you can get. The whole story rests on the premise of the hero loving one woman enough to do anything to win her love, and the heroine loving this same woman, her best friend, so much that she would give up her own happiness for her. The only problem - this friend is the most shallow, hateful caricature I have come across in quite a while. Overall the story crawls along slowly with the most transparent and sickenly convenient little plot ""twists"". If you must read this one - pick it up from the library. But I strongly suggest Hunter's Moon by Karen Robards as much better example of hourse country romantic suspense."
3,This was not new,"This came in a box, but the individual items were not wrapped, and some parts were scuffed up. I think it might have been a returned item. It works well enough for the price I paid, and my 5-year-old enjoys it. However, it is a little tricky to get the microscope and telescope focused. And part of the telescope broke off the first day, but we were able to fix it."
2,Good for a 3 year old,"If you are expecting a microscope/telescope that can be fun to use for a 10 year old, you will be disappointed. This is just a toy, it is just cheap-looking plastic, very difficult to set and very not so enjoyable. It is OK for a 3-4 year old kid to play with for a while, but nothing more."
4,A pioneer study,"Professor Lockmiller's ""Magoon in Cuba"" is a classic. It accurately and vividly portrays the trials and tribulations of the U.S. Governor of Cuba from 1906 to 1909. The sad part is that Magoon's service in Cuba was by virtually all accounts a failure. A good and decent man he was actually accused of ""inventing"" political corruption in Cuba. A silly charge but one that has dogged him. The question is why was he selected for such an important post? Well, as I note in my book, ""Magoon in Panama"" he had been very successful in Panama from 1904 to 1906 where he served as Governor of the Canal Zone and Ambassador to Panama concurrently. The only man to ever hold both positions. His many successess there led to his ""promotion"" to Cuba. What a shame he failed there."
4,Swiss Army LED AA Flashlight,"Really liked the product, it was a gift for someone who really likes Swiss Army merchandise. He loves the flashlight, it works great, only complaint was that he wished it had an on/off button rather than having to turn the head."
2,Don't drop it,"I bought the Victorinox AAA LED flashlight as a Christmas gift for my 8-year-old son. As the other reviewers noted, it has a very bright beam. My son really enjoyed the gift and found MANY uses for it. However, after two weeks it stopped working when he dropped it on our hardwood floor. As best as I can tell, something broke in the bulb assembly. Since I can't find a replacement bulb, I am going to have to send it back to the mfr - too much hassle for a $10 product."
3,Not quite what I was hoping for.,"The main difference I have found with this light is its inability to focus the beam. It has 2 modes, full on, full off. I do like the small size, and love the rugged grip, but overall not nuts about it."
5,Daughter loves this doll!,"Rock-a-bye Chou Chou is a very cute little doll, with the right amount of interaction for a young child. Not overly demanding or frustrating, but interactive enough to keep my 2 yr 3 month old intrigued and entertained. She loves playing with this doll, and it has totally earned the 5 stars I am giving it."
5,Best Doll EVER,"She is the best doll because she allways fall asleep because I have had her for a couple months but I have allways loved dolls.She seems so real to me.Now I can never set her down.She is really cute too.I have a crib,a changing table,a diaper bag,a carseat and some clothes for just her."
5,rock a bye chou chou,"I received my order today, 09/13/06 and it was in excellent condition! I will buy from here again!"
1,Too Much Money,The product is great but the shipping and handling made it $5! I could have went to Pep Boys and got it for a buck! Ooops! Goes to show that not everything should be purchased online!
2,Silly Book,The book is very poorly written. The parallels mentioned are not quite substantiated within the book. An earnest effort from an author who is clearly reaching.
1,Total Disgrace!,This book is absolute trash and should not be viewed seriously. The views and opinions expressed therein are total fabrication and hearsay. Buying this book would constitute a serious waste of money and support for a unreputable and unknowledgable hack-author.
4,Fast paced thriller,This was a very quick and entertaining book to read. At times it is rather graphic but it moves quickly past these bits. It is one of the better English novels that I've read.
2,"Predictable, with uninventive dialogue","This book seemed more like a boring and drawn out made for TV movie than a suspenseful mystery novel.The characters are stereotypical, lack depth and use recycled dialogue. The plot was unneccessarily drawn out and extremely predictable.I couldn't put the book down because I kept hoping that it would get better...it didn't."
5,Above Suspicion,I recently fell in love with books written by Lynda La Plante.I want to read all she has written. Her style keeps you turningthe page and at the end wanting to read another book. I especiallylove the Anna Travis Mysteries.
2,English author should not use US settings,"Way too much use of the F word. Practically on every page and several times. The author lives in London so her English settings are probably OK. However, you simply cannot drive from San Francisco to LA and be there for a 2:30 p.m. meeting with time for lunch and a swim, too. Also I cannot fathom a Super 8 Motel in San Francisco having a concierge!I'll not be looking for her other books."
4,Good pads,"4 starts just because one can not LOVE diaper pads:) I use them for my menses because regular plastic pads gives yeast infection. These pads work great, but have to change often."
1,Can make better ones myself,"New to cloth diapering. Using Thirsties duo wraps for my 14 mon old son. These are cheap, and very small, would work better for a new born. Bought a dozen of them, wish i hadn't. Ended up making my own liners out of old recieving blankets and love the ones i made. wish the description was better."
4,Does what it is supposed to,"This is a great product. It does exactly what it is supposed to, add extra protection. I have washed mine and they stayed in great condition. My son doesn't seem to mind them and they don't irritate him. Also, he is a heavy wetter and with this he hasn't had any leaks. Great product and I would recommend to others that have chosen to cloth diaper."
1,waste of money,"really dont do anything, very short and narrow. they just sit on the shelf here, no use for them. :("
2,Not so great,"Spend the money and get Bum inserts or another quality insert, these are too small. They are about the size of a maxipad, I use two of them.I Have bought some from Dappi and they are a little better."
2,Felt Cheated,"Although I though the book was fairly well written, I felt really cheated by the fact that the authors were unsuccessful in summitting some of the state fifty highpoints. Wait until you've succeeded to write a book about it, otherwise don't bother! It is like hearing from an author who almost won the World Series or almost climbed Everest."
5,A Philosopher with a Light Touch,"Joe - I'm reading this book - finally, and I have to apologize for waiting so long. It's really quite wonderful and I'm enjoying it immensely. You write so well. Not only that but along with the humor, omnipresently threaded through your writing, there is real wisdom and insight into the nature of life. You are a philosopher with a light touch my friend. I'm learning some good stuff from you. What I feel about the book is the writing is just so good now, such a pleasure to read and so much of it has come from the fact that you've seen value in taking risks, pushing yourself and in adventure. Besides being a general good read, the experience offered to the reader is of a deeper significance than may be apparent on the surface and I appreciate you for that. Nel's photos are a profound visual treat - a fine compliment to your writing."
1,Correction,"Thanks for the correction. My Bad.(gave me a good reason to go back...not that you really need it with Kauai.)Again, if anyone's looking for great footage of Hawaii, don't look for it here. DVD's only good use appears to be as a coaster. (And it fails there too due to the hole in the middle.)"
1,Amazon emailed me and they want my review!,But not my business.I would love to review this product but as I have mentioned twice already without a response.....I NEVER RECEIVED IT!
3,heavy duty colpac,good product but I agree with others that the outershell is not the same heavy duty vinyl it used to be. I would suggest they supply a nice tyvek cover for it to avoid damage from other products in the freezer.
5,Wish I'd ordered two!,I bought these for my classroom but my 16 month old daughter immediately claimed this puzzle for her own!! She loves it!!! It is sturdy and amazingly not as annoying as some toys that talk! Very educational!
3,Good story but...,"I really liked the story.It seems like something that could really happen. It has a lot of action and the fight scenes are really cool. But I think the book is overpriced, which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5. It is poorly punctuated, as if nobody proof read it before it was published. At times it is hard to tell when one character stops speaking and another starts.I found that annoying. Also page 60 is blank. I felt like somebody had just handed me a copy of a story they had written and said ""Here read this. What do you think?""But if you can overlook that stuff then you will probably like this book.If it had cost me 5 bucks instead of 10 it would have been a 5 star book."
2,"Very slow, with a ridiculous ending","********** SPOILER ALERT ***************Thoroughly unimpressive, this book dragged until right before the end when the author threw in a huge explosion and an ending that came from absolutely nowhere. It read like a TV episode, not much happened, and there was very little in the way of plot or character development although it did have a fair amount of stunt casting. Why was Sisko in this book? He didn't actually do anything or play any part. The ending was completely from left field and I felt absolutely cheated as a reader.I suppose after having read some really good books recently, the stinkers are even more obvious to me."
3,"Solid writing, but included the two things I never liked about the series","On the good side, I really thought this was a well written novel. Too often, Star Trek and other similiar novels suffer from poor writing. This one did not. The writing was tight and the story was relatively easy to follow throughout.However, this novel included the two elements of DS-9 I never liked. I never liked the Jem'Hadar nor do I like the alternate universe that was introduced in the series, especially with the apparent ease with which members of the other side could move onto this side. This is disturbing on a number of levels.If you like the Jem'Hadar and the alternate universe, pick this one up. You will enjoy it. However, if you are not crazy about either, I recommend passing this one by."
2,"Certainly decent, but not much more. [some spoilers]","I'm a huge fan of the DS9 relaunch, and I was eagerly anticipating this book as a continuation of the exciting storyline the various authors had established. However, after the great descriptions and plots of the previous books, especially the ""Mission: Gamma"" and ""Worlds of DS9"" series, I was very much disappointed by ""Warpath"". Like ""Unity"", the book does advance the plot, and provide some excellent action scenes, but not much else - it definitely does not share the depth and stand-alone nature of the other books. Furthermore, the author liberally reuses a number of plot ideas from previous Star Trek novels, such as the melodrama between Vaughn and Prynn, Ro and Quark. I also intensely disliked the ending, came totally out of nowhere, and didn't expand the DS9 universe at all, something the previous books were excellent at accomplishing. I hope the next installment follows the path established by the previous novels, instead of this new trend."
3,"Good direction, but hurried","Mack definitely knows DS9 and the characters. The direction he took for new Jem'Hadar character is definitely refreshing. But, the story seems to have been written (or maybe edited) in a hurry to tie up loose ends, rather than tell a standalone story."
4,Very Helpful,"I'm working with a design studio that is now offering web services to its clients. This book has been very helpful, giving us a look at web projects and procedures.It is skewed to larger projects than we will likely be involved in.The best parts of the book are the descriptions of real projects and real problems.Humor helps the message get through: that these kinds of projects frequently change, new problems crop up, people don't always react the way you'd expect and that it's all part of the job."
3,"Fairly well written, but Windows only...","I liked this book, really I did. But half the reason I bought it was in hopes that I could find the stuff on the CD useful. Unfortunately, half the stuff on the CD was windows-only, which excludes UNIX and, more importantly, the majority of graphic designers who use Mac computers, such as myself. This flaw is also obvious in the book - anyone unwilling to purchase a windows system and Microsoft Project is SOL. Frustrating.I should say that I also felt the book could be a little bit more specific about invoicing and billing clients. The interview on Extreme Programming (?) was more topical here! Overall, though, it's a pretty good book, but probably not warranting all the five stars!"
2,Not Very Effective,"The scenarios in this book seem to only address large firms, and this book is basically useless for the freelance or 1-man design firm. Aside from that, it may have some value to large firms."
4,Excellent for the new web project manager,"As someone who has been running web projects for quite some time, I found this book to be a bit basic. On the other hand, I wish that I had this book when I first started being responsible for web projects. Some of the information in this book is just plain good old fashioned advice on project management in general. It has very specific information regarding the people you need on your project - the information architect, the visual designer, the database person, etc. More importantly, it has information on how to work with these people successfully, and what you can do to make sure that you deliver the product to the customer's satisfaction. Even as someone with web project experience, I am not disappointed in this book at all. It never hurts to go back and revisit the basics, especially when things start going sideways in a project."
2,"This ""memoir"" is a bit of a stretch","This book is like the other several hundred survivor stories out there. All those stories inspire hope and help us believe in the goodness of humanity, but this book is a large stretch of the imagination. Unlike the Diary of Anne Frank, which is a published diary and can easily have all the details and such that come along with an experience that she had during WWII, this book is relying on memory. And I admit that experiences like that burn themselves into your memory, but there is too much detail in this book for it all to be true. Add this to the fact that this is a rather boring account, I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone except WWII buffs."
5,Memories and events of a young Jewish girl during WWII in Budapest,"On our recent trip to Hungary, we visited the Jewish Quarter and the Holocaust museum in Budapest. This poignant biography of a young Jewish girl during the Nazi occupation of WWII definitely made an emotional connection for us as she and her family fought for survival during this incredibly difficult part of Hungarian history. Memories and events of our childhood impact who we are as individuals."
2,Not worth the shipping,"This diaper pail is not very different from the average cheap garbage can. The lid base is flexible, so it's hard to fit on the top of pail for the one handed parent. Since there isn't a foot pedal, the lid gets yucky if the diapers brush it on their way in. It is okay, but not at all worth the cost when the shipping is added. I love cloth diapers, but don't find this especially helpful or unique."
4,"Does the job, but nothing special.",Good size and works well with the Kissaluvs (sp?) diaper pal liner. Only complaint is that it is a little pricey. The top is kidda flimsy but does not affect the performance of the product as I just keep it open all of the time. Closing and opening it would be a hassle at every diaper change and could cause it to get dirty. If you can find a cheaper pail with similar dimensions - get it instead. This product definitely fulfills its purpose but is nothing special. The diaper pail liner is what I would recommend spending more money on than the pail because it is what does all the hard work.
4,"A poignant ""Clash.."" that hits the mark","William Mandelaris' new book ""A Clash of Values"" is not a comprehensive, research-laden definitive on the effects of the media on our society. Rather, it is meant to be, and succeeds at being, a concise, easily referenced primer on a topic that will to some seem worn out but in reality is more urgent than ever. To that end, Mandelaris has put forth a helpful compilation of data, quotes and stimulating ideas that reinforce what most of us believe but may not know how to articulate. It is particularly useful for those raising children, but nearly everyone who reads it will find something of relevance. This may not be ground breaking material but it is certainly territory that is worth reviewing and more importanty, understanding."
1,A Clash of Values,"William M. Mandelaris is also known as ""Bill Manders"", a right-wing radio talker in Nevada. Before the 2010 Nevada Republican Primary he confided on-air -- several times -- that he was considering a run for the U. S. Senate against the incumbant Harry Reid because ""Rich people deserve representation too."" Seriously. He always addresses his radio audience as ""folks"" and ""you folks"" as if he and they are all of one mind with the same set of ""Values"". Talk radio listeners really listen alone, individually, not in a congregation (or mob), yet Manders, as so many present day radio hosts, employs active pre-screeners to pre-ask what the caller plans to say. ""Manders"" the radio personality, and ""Mandelaris"" the author and media critic, would have their ""folks"" stay ""protected"" like children from outside ideas and ""values"" that don't...""represent rich people""?"
5,A clash of values review,"Just finished reading the book by Bill Mandelaris (""Greg"") entitled 'A CLASH OF VALUES' and have to admire his sense of values and his wide knowledge of the media and its negative affect on the average person. The chapters on the electronic media, trash talk, and a broken moral compass were much to the point. I thought that the chapter captioned 'empowered to fight back' was especially inshghtful. Also, I was very pleased to see the dedication page showing the picture of Jerry, who was like an older brother to me in my youth. As a former teacher of junior high school kids in the inner City (1992-1997), I can related to what Bill says about the media and other outside influences undermining our family principles."
3,Not enough info. from seller,I already owned all the songs on this CD single on other OMD albums that I have purchased in the past...I wish they would have given a complete listing of the songs and their lengths before I wasted my money. The shipping was excellent and the contents in perfect condition...so 3 stars from me.
4,An excellent resource,"One of my favorite books about home education. The author allayed my fears many times when I picked up this book to reassure myself that I wasn't crazy for backing off on the structure and letting my kids learn from what the were doing. Her writing makes you feel as if you are along for the ride, as she shares her thought processes and the experiences that led her to ultimately trust that her children were learning from life. Since this book covers the early years of home education and concludes beyond college entrance, one is given the overall picture. Definitely a must-read. The author will help you find the middle-of-the-road between unstructured and structured learning."
5,Alpha 1 -- the Alpha book of SF story collections,"Anthologies of SF stories are coming out of our ears. Though it is fun to read the best of the year, or the Hugo winners, etc., it is another thing to read stories collected by one of the best writers and editors of SF. The stories have a timelessness that is unusual in SF. These stories are centered around characters with whom we can associate -- even a self-motivated computer, rather than around topical ideas or specific technology. I come back to many of these stories year after year just because they are good."
4,awesome!!,"This toy is great! I got it as a joke for my friend who absolutely hates squid and it isnt broken yet so i can say that it is incredibly durable! Overall a great day, experience, and most importantly, a great toy."
3,Squid rule!,"This was a replacement for a giant squid bought at the Oregon Coast Aquarium.Same thing you'll find at any Zoo/Aquarium. If your kid likes Giant Squid, they'll love this!This is the larger giant squid than the one made by another company. Make sure you read the fine print regarding measurements. It is made of durable plastic, but the long tentacles will come out if pulled hard enough."
4,Six year old loves it,"My grandson asked for this thing for his birthday. As an educational toy it has limited value but he is intensely curious about things with multiple legs, especially sea creatures. It provoked a rash of reading on the subject so I had to admit that it did what we hoped it would, namely inspire his imagination. I recommend the purchase of a book for children on squid, octopus and the like to go along with the model."
5,More of a model than a toy..which is great!,"Love this. I use it as a model for education purposes and helps me also paint the giant squid in my paintings. Yes, I am an artist. This is a great model of a giant squid. Wonderfully detailed. Very realistic. It shows all the suckers all the way down the arms, even you can see it's mouth or ""beak"" underneith all the tentacles/arms. I recommend it."
4,"Reads ""Tam O' Shanter"" too fast--otherwise perfect","Only 4 stars because he reads ""Tam O' Shanter"" a little too fast for my taste. Sure, he's trying to make it a rollicking good time, but if you have to strain--or hold the poem in front of you--to follow along, it's too fast. THAT SAID, the rest of the CD is well-nigh perfect. Cairney's voice suits the material so well, you wonder why he doesn't record the complete works of Burns. Wouldn't that be something?"
2,Comedy tape,"I was disappointed in this one. Most of the routines were really short and some of the content (Whoopie Goldberg) were over the top filthy. Not what I expected. I'm pretty open minded but this one caught me by surprise. There is a great routine by Louie Anderson, but it's not enough to make this item worth the purchase price."
2,Destroyed in 3 days,"I got this for my large dog for a Christmas present. He loved this toy, but he destroyed it in 3 days."
2,Didn't Make It,"I have an 8 lb. Toy Fox Terrier that put a large hole in this in a short time. It was soft, as advertised, but was not durable."
2,horrible,"This fleece toy had a whole in it within two minutes of my lhasopoo chewing it. It was not sewn together well and the stuffing was pulled out by my dog within minutes. I had to throw it away. Very bad quality. Also, the picture is deceiving. This is for one small fleece dog toy....not three as is shown in the picture."
2,Weaver Polar Lens Cap,"I'll keep it simple the, Weaver Polar Lens Cap are great lens covers and that's all.Make no mistake the Yellow-tinted lens is not meant to see through your lucky if you see beyond 25 yards.I hope this helps :)"
3,Uncomfortable Plier Set,"Feel cheap and spring squeak when you clamp down (might be normal). Smaller than I was hoping and uncomfortable to use. Next time I get pliers, after these break, I'll get a better quality set. But for now, they do the job."
2,Save your money,These tools are basically useless unless you want to give them to your son or daughter-Also I did not know Stanley tools are now made in China !! Save your money and buy American made hand tools-they are still out there -you just have to look.
3,The key word here is MINI,"A few things you should be aware of before purchasing these.The key word is MINI. They are small.Bi-Material seems to mean metal tools with rubber grips. Not any nice alloy.Five of the six tools are spring loaded, and Stanley provides no way to keep them closed ( the 2 needle nosed pliers have a little piece of plastic over the tips that you will quickly lose ).The springs look like if they get wet, will quickly rust and/or fall out.The flat nose pliers have sharper edges than the cutting tools and are much easier to cut yourself on them.The groove joint pliers are small enough to be relatively useless.I wouldn't 'even put these up with Stanley's reduced quality standards.Unless you need to have more tools or have spare money to waste, I'd skip this set. Three stars is being quite generous."
2,Name brand but knockoff quality.,"I don't see these lasting very long. They are quite small, and seem intended for a beginner hobbyist. The quality is also very poor considering it is supposed to be name brand. Wire cutters have trouble cutting even the thinnest wires, and the pliers are too small to use for anything serious."
5,A great text,"The biggest problem with most economics textbooks is that the authors just don't shut up. Blanchard is the exception. He writes informally, but doesn't say more than is necessary. As a result, the textbook doesn't feel like a textbook (which makes studying orders of magnitude easier), and it's much shorter. Each chapter is, on average, about 15 pages long, which can be read in less than an hour. And the amazing thing is that you learn just as much macroeconomics as you would anywhere else! Also nice is the history of economics section added at the end, and the role of such economic giants as Samuelson, Solow, Friedman (and lots of other people at MIT, UChicago, and one or two from Stanford and ... psh... Harvard.)"
2,Mediocre learning tool,"Olivier Blanchard (M.I.T.) clearly knows his macro stuff, but he has a hard time articulating some of the more basic - and thus fundamental - elements of macro theory. Blanchard's explanation of the key IS-LM relation is very weak, very confusing- Mankiw does a much neater job. This book is full of complicated algebra and thus will be a huge headache for anyone who doesn't love the more tedious realms of math. Reading through the text, the content frequently waffles between inane digressions and examples, and equally useless mathematical derivations. I do give this book credit, 2 stars that is, for being comprehensive; it covers more than any comparable book."
5,"May be Experimental, but Very Accessible!","The 52 short pieces here cover (mainly) 1940's-1950's Brooklyn. Starting with death, they finish with some of the funniest pieces of paranoid ever. In fact,some could be incredible simply for a stand up comic! Compared to most other ""Experimental"" fiction, this is really a breezy, at times slightly bizarre, but very accessible and amusing, read. For those who enjoy the old musical ""Standards"", try to discover how many titles and lines are hiden in these pages! All in all , very worthy and fun read!"
5,Great read!,"One of the best-looking outdoor books on the market, as well as one of the most funny & entertaining."
5,14mm High Speed Die Review,"I needed a 14mm X 1.0 round die to thread some parts I was fabricating for my vintage motorcycle. Local stores only had octagonal shaped units that were too large to fit my die holder.Getting desperate, I began to search the internet. I came across this unit while searching AMAZON.COM. The dimensions listed about the product made it clear this unit was what I had been looking for.Shipping time was extremely quick. I had the unit in my hands within days of placing my order. My first impressions was that this was a high quality unit. Made in Japan of high quality steel and precison manufacturing, it was a marked contrast to the cheap Chinese made items I had found locally.The die performed flawlessly. It plugged right into my die holder and cut threads into steel with no problems. I can highly recommend this unit and VICTORY MACHINE to anyone searching for items like this."
1,Incredibly Weak,"I was really looking forward to watching this DVD on the land down under, what a disappointment. The film footage is incredibly weak, so dated it seems to have been made in the early 80's. The quality is also poor, with the picture being so grainy I wish I would have bought the video over the DVD so I wouldnt feel as bad about wasting the money. The content overall is mediocre but it was mostly like watching a bad commercial, doing no justice to an amazing country."
2,Mediocre,The material is old and the sections are very short. It's helpful to see some basic footage of each area but it's worthless for trip planning or meaningful information.
2,Complicated Watches and their repair,"Not a very up to date book on watch repair. There are also very few pictures/diagrams available. For those wanting to buy a book about watch repair at a beginners level, I'd suggest you look elsewhere."
4,Better than I thought,"He is better than most of the paintings you usually think of, when you see more of his work.I see lots of critics in these reviews. Funny they don't share their websites where we canlook at theirs, but thats to be expected I guess. What I think is so very funny is, the morethey put him down. The more and more and more, his fans are going to buy it.Why? Because the only thing more irritating than a Kinkade painting, is a self appointedcritic of the same.Kinkade has done something very well. Its started a real debate about what art has to be,and what kind of people you have to be, before you are capable of really understandingwhat you are allowed to enjoy.Those who wish to define it by only a particular social circle, will starve Im afraid, ifonly due to their own harshness. They are painting themselves in a 1% corner.Kinkade has taught people to unite and trade amungst themselves and ignore the critics, and they can'tSTAND it. Good for them, good for him."
1,Eh gads!!,"Ah, Thomas Kinkade's ""art"" -- an oxymoron if one ever existed. While Thom can take comfort in his fortune, his millions will never buy him what he truly seeks -- The respect of the art community. Nope, Kinkade's kitch will never grace the walls of a major museum or art gallery (unless of course he happens to own the place). Instead, his mass-produced, brass-plated monstrosities can found at a mall near you. It's the fine art of ""collecting"" for the art-ignorant -- people who can't wait to dump their kid's college funds on an over-priced ""limited edition"" reproduction from a professional marketer. Those of you that have a Kinkade numbered art-product hanging over your Levitz sofa may like this book. Those with taste in art, run -- run fast."
1,Inferior work and un-original,"While his work could be called beautiful and very exact, it doesn't appear to me as art. Perhaps the original author should be better accredited. Kinkaide's art seems as though he took lessons from a public access telivision show on painting nature scenes. While his paintings are beautiful and masterfully done, and convey some warming emotion - they have little more meaning than a photograph of 'Grandpa's farm', or a small town. For a painter of such talent, he should try originality and see where it takes him."
4,Narwhal,"This toy is very realistic and a great value for the money. I would not suggest it for the everyday child because of the tusk. It is not sharp, but it could very easily rip or break off if not handled properly. It is a great item for a collection, such as my own."
4,ode to giovanni falcone,"It reads life a college History text book. Not a super quick read, many facts and names to bog you down. However if you're interested in the topic it's fascinating to learn the boldness, and extent of Mafia influence. Could you imagine if our prosecutors and police who investigated Organized crime here in the US were continually being killed and blown-up. We would be beside ourselves with indignation and determination to root them out."
5,"War Drums,Piano's,Harmonica's-EVERYTHING!!!","My goodness ""War weighs alot!This is the bands debbut albumwithout Eric Burdon and they try to do ALOT on this album!Thesongs all have very substantial musical ideas and even when theyare more minimal the listener will feel as if they are swimming in this music.Not drowning though-on ""Sun Oh Sun""they start out in one way and suddenly spin into another idea entirely-the piano-based gospel of ""Lonely Feelin'"" is a highly celebretory tunefocusing again on War's newfound independance.""War Drums"",""Videka"" and ""Fidel's Fantasy"",featuring a chanted rap,are all more sonically elaborate numbers and that feeling is only tempered by the pretty ballad ""Back Home"" smack in the middle.But don't be put off-even if loose and artsy ""War"" is definately one of the bands very best albums and a happy omen if you will on the signiture sound this funky band form east LA would formulate in the near future!A must-have!"
1,Dated & Poor Quality,"The images shown on this DVD are quite dated, and of a very poor quality. Many scenes are blurred with very questionable color. Often the DVD uses still photos, with the camera zooming or panning to provide 'movement'. If you are seeking a DVD on Spain, try the Rick Steves titles - the quality is far superior, the info better, and even Rick's older DVDs are more current."
5,Used extensively,This book was used for a class called the biology of flowering plants. We used this book to identify the flowers we found on field trips. It is a great reference book and was broken down in families which helped us identify other flowers not in this book.
5,Simply the best reference,"I live in Austin and have a real love for native Texas plants and flowers and have spent many hours gathering native wildflower seeds by hand in the wild with friends who are experts in the native plants of the Texas Hill Country. Also tore out most of our backyard and planted a native Texas flower garden. When I first started going out on seed gathering trips with my plant expert friends, they said this is THE reference book to have above all others for the flowers of the Hill Country. Since buying my copy, I've added others such as those by Jan Wrede, Geyata Ajilvsgi and the Wasowskis, but Enquist's guide is still my ""wildflower Bible"". The photographs are excellent, and the descriptions are detailed. My only wish is that he would publish a revised edition, as some of the scientific names of flowers have changed. This book is a must-have for anyone serious about the wildflowers of the Texas Hill Country."
5,Best resource for local flower identification,I am a Texas wildflower fanatic! I've identified and collected over 100 flower specimens just in Mills County and this book was very helpful. You don't have to flip through dozens of photos of flowers in the Piney Woods or Coastal Plains since the book only shows flowers in our specific geographic area. I highly recommend it. It's worth the search.
3,Not bad after effort and ingenuity.,"I purchased a pair of these, of course one was the link, the other was the light with the plug. They pair looked lovely in my 14 gallon tank, although 2 sets was overkill. I have run across two problems. Mounting the lights in the tank was a hassle. I screwed them to two small blocks of wood, then screwed a wood screw through the back of the plastic hood and into the block that was attached to the lights. I could actually set the angle of the moonlights by twisting the wood screw. This worked well for about 6 months, which lead to the 2nd problem. The wiring connections in the light had corroded out. Unfortunately, that was the end of the moonlights. The reason I rate this product a three is because of the price. With a little ingenuity, this is a good addition to the tank, but be ready to replace it in six months. I'll probably find a different replacement."
3,Persil Megaperls,"Being German I grew up with the scent of Persil and is is a fabulous product, which works well in conjunction with my Miele front loader. Especially if you want your laundry white without adding bleach. However, charging $ 50.00 is a rip-off that almost leaves me speechless.I have been ordering Persil from Amazon the past ten years, and watched the price slowly but steadily go up from $28.00 to over $40.00. It was understandable, while the exchange rate between Euro and US $ was not favorable for the dollar. Unfortunately the price never went back down again to reflect the most current exchange rates.I just looked on Amazon.de and the same 40load package Persil sells for Euro 12.99 which today equals roughly $18.00..... I would love to continue buying it from Amazon, but I am not willing to pay $50.00 and I wish a few more users would speak up about the unreasonable price increase !"
4,"Works well, strong smell","I like this product. It has been difficult for me to find powdered HE laundry detergent for my front loader. It does a good job cleaning my clothes and it dissolves nicely (no residue left in the detergent cup). I'm not sure that it does any better job than the liquid All Small & Mighty that I had been using before. I find the fragrance to be quite strong, although not objectionable. This box will last me a long time...I have soft water and really don't need to use much (unless the load is REALLY dirty, I'm only needing to use about 1 Tablespoon)."
4,Powdered Persil,"I've been using Persil for only about 10 years. It works amazingly well (cleans and whitens) and I really like the scent. Though I prefer the powder to the liquid version in general - especially for laundry best cleaned by powder - both work great. Why not 5 stars? In my experience, it works as well on dirt as Tide HE powder. I prefer the Persil scent and size of box make sit easy to decant (the new smaller boxes of Tide might tip the scales) but it's a solid 4-star value proposition. Bottom-line: It's the most effective powdered detergent I've used and will continue to be my first choice but no longer a ""must-have"" given new formulas of other brands."
3,great product - but expensive,"To get clean laundry this is the best you can get.You don't need a lot of detergent and you don't need to add bleachto get your laundry clean.I also have a laundry machine that is a front loader and this machine is able to heat the water and controlthe temperature. So I get the best results with Persil - and the fabrics and the laundry machine are preserved well, the stains are gone.The only contra is:the price.In Europe I can get 2.375 kg for under 10 Euro (incl. Taxes), that isunder 15 Dollars.Here I have to pay for 1.2 kg 19.50 Dollar - that is more than twice the price!!!So two stars less for the horrifying price."
1,"this was a gift,but i forgave the person who did it","i don't get it,the same company(i think it is anyway) that puts out the 50 packs i like so much puts these 20 packs which tells me why so many movies are repeated in these 20 packs, but why does the quality get so bad between the two. save your money and buy the 50 pack!!!!!!!"
4,"Fun, cheap, surprising","This is one of the best DVD purchases I've ever made. For less than six bucks (when you figure in shipping), I got a 20-pack of film noir and suspense classics, with such gems as THE MAN ON THE EIFFEL TOWER (Charles Laughton as Inspector Maigret), SUDDENLY (Frank Sinatra as a would-be presidential assassin), PORT OF NEW YORK (has to be one of Yul Brynner's first starring roles), and my two favorites so far, THE STRANGER (a lesser-known Orson Welles movie starring Edward G. Robinson) and, on the other end of the spectrum, the movie I'm watching tonight, JAIL BAIT, written and directed by Edward G. Wood.Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed: the quality of the transfers is FAR from HD quality (some of them are from old prints, like the quality you'd see on an afternoon or late night UHF movie feature, with fuzzy sound, choppy edits, etc).But if you're like me and sometimes you just want to veg on the couch watching an old movie, this set is MORE than worth it."
5,good product,You wont love all the movies but most. It is worth the investment because there is such a nice vareity of different movies that you are nicely surprised . It is a good buy.
4,"Necessary reference material for ""Cyberlawyers""(tm)","Overview: CyberLaw is, indeed, a good reference book, replete with footnotes, that will be useful to business professionals, lawyers, and law students seeking an introduction to the evolving law governing the digital age. It supplements information that is available for free online at http://www.cyberlaw.com/, and a later chapter provides a fascinating chronology of significant events of the 1990s.The full text of this review is online at:http://www.redstreet.com/readingroom/reviews/cyberlaw.htm"
1,Does not work with Adobe Photoshop CS2,"I bought the Spyder 2 Plus believing the Colorvision software would also install on Adobe Photoshop CS2, but it doesn't. I called their support desk and they walked me through the simple procedures unsuccessffully. The person with whom I spoke said that the installation disc was probably corrupted, and I was then directed to their website to download the latest Colorvision Profiler shown, which is dated August 2002. It is a bit behind the times, apparently, to work with CS2, because it also didin't work at all.I don't know what the PlUS is all about, if its latest downloadable program is three years old, and it doesn't funcion with the latest Adobe Photoshop CS2. This important information is not posted anywhere."
3,Implementing a PMO,"Overall a good book, with lots of good advice for those starting or improving a PMO.However it got a bit hung up in the necesity of directly adding value to every project, e.g. by reducing cyckle time and increaing throughput. My organization cleary sees the value of implementing a PMO, but does not necesarily want to change our whole approach to Project Management.Still, not a bad read..."
1,Disappointing,"I have been looking forward to every new series being made available, but series No 7 is a big let-down, mainly because of too many changes in (A)the charactors we all got to love and (B) the plot has become tired - too many ""situations"" of the past being repeated, and this made me decide not to buy series 8 and those which may follow. I will rather start watching all over from series 1 chapter 1 to get all the fantastic laughs all over again."
4,love it.,"This series is wonderful - light entertainment, great for the end of the day when you don't want to have to think hard about anything, but want to have a laugh."
4,Another series in true Allo Allo style,This is another excellect Allo Allo series. It's a shame Captain Bertorelli is a different actor but the series is still full of hysterical moments.
4,Birding the World to the Max,"I had read this book a couple of years ago and just finished the other Phoebe Snetsinger book ""Life List: A Woman's Quest for the World's Most Amazing Birds byOlivia Gentile.In this, Snetsinger's autobiography, she is focused more on her birding, her world travels to see the 8,400+ species she found, and some of the reasons and motivations for her accomplishments. Gentile's book details more of Snetsinger's background, family life, and suppositions for her behavior.I personally found this book the more interesting of the two as I am more interested in world travel and birding. I wanted to know what it would be like if you had the time and money (like Snetsinger)to go wherever you wanted what that life could be like. I appreciated the detail of the travels to Peru, India, Kenya, Australia, Papau New Guinea, rather than the family information presented in Gentile's biography, although other readers that are not interested in birding may find that book more readable."
4,For birder's only,"If you are not a birder this book would be very dry and probably meaningless. However if you bird, even casually, you will be enthralled and eager to get your binoculars out to travel far and wide to catch a glimpse of only a few of the 8,000 species Phoebe saw."
4,"Every now and then, a good dead movie comes along.","Suppose the pipeline from corpse to afterlife suffers gridlock every now and then? And the Angel of Death has to park a few souls somewhere? Now - suppose, after the souls have gotten to know one another, the Angel returns with the news that he took one too many - ? And the souls have to decide - who gets to go back? Robert Forster makes a fine Angel of Death; Hauser, Paul, and the other members of a small cast turn in fine performances as well. See it if you can - own it if possible: a great sick-day treat."
1,OLD very old,This shampoo has not been made in over 15 years old stuff yuck. This was a good shampoo when it was new.
5,Williams Fairey Band,The Williams Fairey Band is one of the finest brass bands in the world and right up there next to the Black Dyke Mills Band. This group has been the winner of many brass band championships. The other reviewer is quite obviously not into the British Band scene and therefore the review should be taken with a grain of salt! This is brass playing of the highest order from start to finish! If you are looking for more of an American brass sound you should check out recordings by the Brass Band of Battle Creek but please do not degrade a first class organization like The Fairey band!
5,Wonder Woman : Mythos (audio cd),Wonder Woman is my favorite character and I love the book! To hear it come to life is mind blowing! It's perfect!
3,Super Reader,"Although a Wonder Woman story, there are parts to play for others in the JLA, Flash, Green Lantern, Superman, et. al. WW finds an island of reverse Amazons, so to speak, and other oddities in the course of this adventure.If the Bermuda Triangle is in a story, it is also pretty much a given that there will be some sort of mystery."
2,disgraceful hack job,"I must be the world's biggest Carol Lay fan. As far as I know, I have everything she's ever done.So naturally I had to have this.I chiefly love Carol Lay for her wacky yet penetrating insights into human nature, but there's not a trace of that here. It's a straight fan-fiction job. It's like it's not even written in Ms. Lay's voice. If you're looking for a wry, irony, Lay-style take on Wonder Woman, you're in for a serious let-down.What a disappointment. I guess she needed the money."
4,Articulate Sophomore,"That Petrol Emotion rose from the meltdown of delightful twerps The Undertones, Derry's own Ramones. Their second and hard to find second album ""Babble"" runs roughshod over the sophomore checkpoint in the road. The first two songs still pound and swirl with guitars in a high wind - the break in ""Spin Cycle"" truly excites. ""Big Decision"", as close as this overlooked group ever got to a ""popular"" hit, is a fine jump-around the joint tune, all despite its fairly serious theme, the decision whether or not to leave the old sod behind. The Petrols could have used a better vocalist. The west coast Yank that they took on unfortunately comes from the Offspring school of thin and reedy obnoxiousness. Undertones vocalist Feargal Sharkey's weird caterwalling was at least endearing. No matter, here and elsewhere (check out ""Manic Pop Thrill"") the lads from the North of Ireland, powered by the brothers O'Neill, mash out a fine guitar sound all their own."
3,Not the Babble I expected,"I bought this expecting for it to be the same group that put out the albums 'Ether' and 'The Stone'. Unfortunately, it is a different group with the same name. It is listenable punk rock style stuff but not what I wanted... Be warned!"
3,Pay attention to the size! This is really tiny.,"This is a beautiful medal and I thought the price was too good to be true... buyer beware... this is a very tiny medal (I have never seen one sooo small!). If that's what you're looking for, you'll be thrilled. When I opened the box, I was amazed... Get out your rulers.. Do you really know what 8mm looks like?"
1,No sub or dub.,"This review rating isn't a reflection of the show.This disc is supposed to be dubbed and it isn't , the menu doesn't even have any language or subtitle options , which is kind of weird since all the writing on the case is in english. I had seen a few episodes online and wanted my own copy because I really enjoyed what I'd seen , it was an interesting premise that I wanted to see to conclusion. But since I'm not fluent in japanese , I guess I'm out of luck for now."
3,Pretty good towels,"The towels are very pretty and I love the diamond blue color I purchased. I got them at a very good price. However, 1 of the towels did start to unravel at the seams after the 1st wash. It's not too bad though and I only use the towels in my bathroom, but I was just surprised to see the seams come apart after only 1 wash. The other towel I ordered is completely fine and in excellent condition. Must just be the luck of the draw."
4,Nice towels,These towels are really good quality and nice-looking. I am very happy with the purchase.
1,DON'T BUY IT,"JUST DON'T BUY IT. It looks that the text was scanned and transformed into Word. Nice try, but it barely reads. Simply, don't buy it!!!"
3,The Hite Report on Shere Hite,I reviewed this book over two weeks ago and you never printed it - what's up with that?
4,The Case for Climate Change,"The book takes a logical stance from the development of observations in science to a political conclusion and what to do about climate change. This is two books. One is the science of global warming and climate change. The other is about politics.The science side is abbreviated. The authors avoid an in-depth discussion and rely mostly on correlations for explanation. A graph on page 74 is stunning. It is a better match than Gore's correlation from An Inconvenient Truth. I had only hoped that the authors had talked about laboratory results of experiments on greenhouse gases.The politics side is wordy and a bit predictable, although Dessler and Parson do a good job in making a very logical and well-developed case."
4,Good overview of the controversy.,"Outlines the uneducted arguments against the existence of climate change and disproves them with SCIENCE. Read this and you will not only understand the issue, but you can tell other people why they are wrong and have no idea what they're talking about."
5,Excellent! Take an arm chair trip!,"Worth the money as this includes extras on the Inside Passage, a history of the gold rush, and a look at the wilderness of Alaska. It was an incredible 2 hours of travel. We have been there and this brought back many fond memories. Enjoy the sights."
3,Pepper Mill - OK,"I bought this pepper mill to use at our dining table. I did not notice when buying it that it did not have a light. Would have been much better if it did. And once you set the size of the grind, it is almost impossible to keep it there. The quality is great, and push come to shove, I would probably buy again."
1,Failure!,Worked fine until the batteries needed changing. Could never figure out how to do this. No instructions included.
5,Best Soundtrack out of this world,"If you are a true wwf fan that brought every single t-shirts of your favourite wrestlers,you sure must not miss not wwf:volume 4 cos this is the best soundtrack that i heard before OH HELL YEAH"
5,BEST WWF CD I HAVE HERD,This Has to be the best CD of WWF music.I love it when THE ROCKStheme song starts to fade out he starts singing his Elvis tunesto HeartBreak hotel.And My favorite tunes our Vince McMahon'smusic and Chris Jericho's and finaly Triple HHH's theme music.......
2,Waste,I bought this as a wart cure... Didn't work then I was warned to stop using it as it will turn your skin blue!
5,Thought provoking,I have only read about a fourth of the book but it only to a couple pages to grab my attention.
2,so drawn out...,"I love Ann Tatlock, but I couldn't even finish this one. Because of the high ratings here on Amazon, I reserved it at my library. They didn't even have it. They had to bring it in from another district in the country. I tried and tried to keep reading. Since I could only renew it once, I didn't finish it. I only made it half way through. Even though the characters were interesting, it just didn't draw me back to read more than a page or two at a time. The chapters were so long that I couldn't even use that as a goal. But I'm not taking Ann Tatlock off my list of great authors."
5,Excellent! I can't wait to read the next one.,"I was totally fascinated by the characters in this good book. I learned so much about the Depression years, and I actually enjoyed learning about this period in our history. This author has a gift. Her next book is already in my shopping cart awaiting purchase. Definitely five stars."
2,2 1/2 stars --- Story is too drawn out --- Lost interest,"I started out praising this book. The writing is really quite lovely. BUT the story is sooooo drawn out. Scenes that could have taken a paragraph or two go on and on and on. I realize a writer has to set the mood but Tatlock goes so overboard in detailing every emotion and happening that it TAKES AWAY from the story. I've read LONG books (over 1000 pages) and the story was so good I didn't want them to end, but this story did not have enough subplots ... or any.. to carry the long windedness.I'm sorry, but because of this major flaw I left this book near the end. By that time I really didn't care what happened to the characters, and I think that is the very WORST THING that can happen to a reader."
1,A cheap knock off of the master's work.,"Unable, or unwilling, to secure the cooperation of Adams' estate, the publishers of this book have used images from the US national archive.These substandard images have been reproduced hair, dust and all! It's an insult to a man who spent his life teaching and promoting quality photography."
3,pocket tester,Tester works fine except it comes with a (warning label) that says test cords are lead based and you shouldwash your hands after using.
4,Good Book,"I love books that help my kids learn about real people from history. This book was fun to read and made you feel like you knew Molly. It focuses on her childhood, but also included the story of her helping the American soldiers during the Revolutionary War after she was grown. My biggest concern is that I don't think it will hold up well over the years because it was printed on low quality paper. It was inexpensive, so I wasn't surprised at the paper quality, but it is the sort of book I'd like to keep around, so we'll see how it holds up."
3,this is sleaze rock!,"This cd is fun, the music is okay (there is no lasting quality, great work, feeling that you will get) but it is a fun, almost perverted work.The title ""Death by Sexy"" and cover artwork is a good representative of what you will get. Not serious, have a good time, riff oriented music.This is a side project for these band members and it sounds like it since the band is obviously having fun.The best songs are ""Want you so Bad"" and ""Sweat"""
3,Not as good as the first album.,I expected more after their debut album - still good but not great by any means.
4,Cherry Cola!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Boys Good news!!!! Eagles Of Death Metal are back!!!!!! this time the formula seems to be reduced to Jesse and Josh only but the result is still Eagles Of Death Metal , perhaps a little colder than Love, Sex, Death metal, the duo offers a collection of songs that goes from hard to pop, from Heavy to Southern with funny lyrics, funny vocals and music not overproduced at all, this is an album to enjoy completelly without thinking really hard on the concept that this duo offers, put it on your equipment and they will do the restHM"
4,Death By Sexy,"If you like your music sexy and danceable, than this is the album for you. One of the many great byproducts of Josh Homme and his many eclectic and talented friends. My favorite track being ""Eagle's Goth."" This is a great album."
1,lame,"awful choice if looking for other sources of Hommes' musical generosity. this album performs oral pleasure. unless you are male and forty-something, in need of revisiting your glory days, this is a mistake to own. kyuss, (pre-2006) qotsa, and even the shrooms/alcohol-induced desert sessions leaves this collection of wasted studio time in the dust. i didn't enjoy the music either."
3,"Okay, but not as expected","This album is good, but that is only because Eagles of Death Metal is a good band.After having listened to the first album this album is obviously subpar. Their first album (Peace, Love, Death Metal) is, in my own opinion, much better written and executed. Overall a good album but most definetly buy the first album as well."
2,just good for the eye candy,"The beginning was good, but after ep. 8 it got boring to me. The only thing that kept me watching was for Lee Minho and Kim Huyn joong. Sorry but the main lead girl's acting didn't do it for me, I think Kim So Eun was so much better"
5,One of the Best,"This is one of the best k-dramas ever made, words can't express Boys Over Flowers, and I can't say enough about the infamous F-4. They are good-looking, rich, and powerful. This is k-drama that's very good from the beginning to the end. There was never a dull moment. Though I wasn't crazy about the ending. (The Japanese version ending was much better). Never the less, it is well written and the actors are good (except for the leading lady). Not to mention the sound track is kick a@@. I highly recommend this k-drama."
4,omar,good toy to use in the pool.It appears durable but time will tell.Size is just right for children.The price a little high but I recommend it
1,Incorrect information,The product you are trying to sell is not starring Eille Norwood as listed but is a more modern collection of Television shows. I made a mistake and bought one.
5,GREAT READ,I HAVE READ THIS BOOK AT LEAST SIX TIME. I LOVE IT BUT NOW I NEED IT IN EBOOK FORMAT SO I CAN ADD IT TO INDIGO AND VIVID. PLEASE.Pat
5,Love it! Love it! Love it!,"I see why everyone gave this book 5 stars because, it's that good and so much more.I gave this book to my sister to read, and she never reads for pleasure, let alone a historical romance. She finished this book in 2 days."
5,UNFORGETABLE...both romantically and historically!,This was one of the most exciting love stories I have read...and I've read scores. I think the reason this story is so powerful is that it is totally believable.
5,BLACK HISTORY HAS NEVER BEEN CAPTURED SO VIVIDLY . THANKS,"BEVERLY JENKINS IS THE GREATEST. I HAVE ACQUIRED A LOT OF HISTORY & KNOWLEDGE, IN ADDITION I WAS ABLE TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESEARCH DUE TO THE BOOKS I READ BY HER. THE ROMANCE IS DONE IN A FASHION THAT EVERY WOMAN (BLACK ESPECIALLY) WOULD LOVE TO BE TREATED & SOME IS TREATED. MS. JENKINS HAS THE TALENT TO WRITE A BOOK THAT MAKES A WOMAN APPRECIATE WHO/WHERE/WHEN SHE CAME. WITH MY HUSBAND HAVING PRIOR MILITARY EXPERIENCE, I HAVE THROUGHLY ENJOYED THE BUFFALO SOLDIER SERIES. I AM WAITING FOR 8/98 RELEASE. I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET OTHER FRIEND & FAMILY INTO READING HER BOOKS. WITH THIS ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONAL PIECE & WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE HISTORY AS WELL AS THE ROMANCE IN THE BOOK. AGAIN, IF YOU WANT GOOD, INTERESTING, EDUCATIONAL AND STIMULATING READING, GO TO THE STORE & REQUEST HER BOOKS. THANKS FOR THE EDUCATION."
4,Chapin pump free industrial compressor sprayer,"I love this pump sprayer. 3.5 gals. Pumps easily & sprays 4 long distances. Being 65 & having the use of only 1 hand, I am able 2 pump this tank enough 2 do my larger areas, (have large acreage), unlike the traditional pump sprayers, in which one has 2b very strong, otherwise u can only spray small areas at a time. I put this on a cart, the one u can buy at Sam's 4 about $20.00 that shows hauling cases of sodas, etc., strapped it w/bungee cords, because this unit is heavy when full. Haven't needed 2 use a compressor....so easy just 2 pump by hand. This is a chemical sprayer & made 4 the use of chemicals. Would've given 5 stars, had the inside metal tube split....possibly just defective....had 2 replace & cost about $15.00. Didn't think 2 call manufacturer 2 see if they would replace. They do have great customer service. It is an awesome looking tank. Neighbor impressed & wants 2 order one. Would still highly recommend."
2,won't last,"We got this for Christmas for our 15 lb. Westie. He loves to fetch. But, he also loves to chew. He chewed through the edges the first time he played with it. It is fun if you just throw it and let them retreive it, but if a dog keeps it for any amount of time it will be chewed up into pieces."
4,Good toy for small yard,"I have read several of the reviews for this product and have noticed that several reviewers gave poor marks to this product because their dog chewed it up. Well most dogs will destroy any toy given enough time. I gave this product 4 stars because it stood up to a great deal of abuse by my two labradors for over a year. I did not allow them to have access to this toy except for once a day when I tossed it to them in the yard for 10-15 minutes. This thing was subjected to some harsh treatment by the pooches as most tosses turn into a tug-of-war at my house. In the end, the corners of the toy got torn a bit and overall the toy is worn. However, the plastic struts that give this toy the rigidity it needs to fly were never snapped by my dogs. This toy is not meant to be flung very far and is probably best at within 50 feet. So if you have a dog that likes to play fetch and you have a small yard, this is a good toy to have. Just put the toy out of reach when you are done."
3,not very durable,"My dog loves this! only reason I give it 3 stars is that it is not very durable. She only played with it once and easily broke part of the frame. After one of those cracks, the frisbee doesn't fly the same and won't go as far when you throw it. It is still useable, just not as fun!"
5,perfect toy,our german shepard loves it. It spins along the ground and she chases it. It holds up well and still works with parts chewed off. Eventually though all is gone. But this is a great toy.
1,For heavy chewers - stay away!!,"Just bought one last week at a big outdoors store. Seemed like fun and hey it came in camo with orange. My dog loved it - started chewing on the squirrel and that was all she wrote. Torn up in no time. One star might be a little low, but what can I say. Spent $13 and in less than a week, it's torn up. Great idea. Lousy durability. If your dog is a 'chewer' spend your money elsewhere!"
1,Destroyed in one day,"My dog loved this toy...but she chewed it apart within two hours. There was no fixing it. The fabric, the plastic points, the frame -- all of it was chewed to pieces. (And my dog -- a three-year-old blue heeler -- is not an aggressive chewer.) If your dog likes to chew rawhides or plush toys, it could destroy this toy in no time flat."
4,My dog loves it,"Our 9-month old puppy loves this toy, and we're on our 3rd one. Unfortunately, she has learned to chew the toy apart by starting on the seam at the back - so these haven't lasted as long as we'd hoped. If your dog isn't a persistent chewer, it's a great toy. It flies much better than a frisbee, is soft for their teeth - and has glow-in-the-dark feet. We try to only let her play with it when we're outside with her. If we leave it with her for hours, she'll chew holes in it."
5,Love the Flying Squirrel,"Great product..my dog loves it.She will only use this product, not other frisbees.A+"
4,Flying Squirrel,Excellent for fetch. Make sure you put your name on it! Or when it goes over the fence you might not get it back!
1,DOES NOT meet normal 'Chuckit' quality expectations,"I own every ball that Chuckit makes, and love them all - no complaints, always very durable and long lasting. Not the case with this item as it lasted all of 5 minutes with my medium sized (65lb) Golden Retriever. He chewed two of the corners off immediately, which of course rendered it useless for flight. I would stay away from this item if your dog is known to destroy toys quickly."
2,My dogs have to have them but could be made much better,They are the only flying toys my border collies will catch. In 2 years I have purchased over 100We play about 2 to 3 hrs a dayI would pay a little more if they improved their construction.the stitching on the plastic feet blow apart with about 5 hrs of play due flimsy thread and light gauge nylon on the bottom.
3,Retribution for Traitors,Sorry Rod....you can't play me with that contrived ending.She was an arrogant reporter...she deserved to go to prison...By the way I was rooting for the Matt Dillon character from the get-go
2,The true story would have been better,"I agree that the real story about the Valerie Plame outing would have been better. I kept relating this to Judith Miller, whom I did not find particularly sympathetic at all. Thus I found it hard to be involved in a character who had no reason to write the story, unrealistically relied on an unreliable source for her information, had no remorse at the outcome for the CIA agent, and spent a lot of time in prison for something she should known was considered a crime."
2,All this suspense for this?!?!?!,"NO short attention span summary. (That's already been done before.)But after this movie was over and ALL this suspense was built up around who was the source of the leak-- do you really mean to tell us that a woman spent nearly a year in jail protecting an 8 year old-- who was not even a proper source and didn't ask for anonymity as a condition of speaking (or, for that matter, who didn't know about what he was speaking)?Give me a break.There are better things to do with 2 hours of your life.The cast was great (Angela Bassett), but if I'd wanted to see her, she acted in better movies.Save your time/ money."
1,COMICAL IN IT'S BIAS !,"The only believable character in this liberal tripe , is Matt Dillon , who is supposed to be cast as a villianous prosecuter.In actuality , he has far more compassion , for this misguided fool than is called for. The silly , self righteous reporter both loses and gets , just what she deserves.Alan Alda is simply embarassing !Horrible Movie !"
1,You'll Need Anti-depressants,"This is the most depressing movie I have ever seen. It's a step by step guide on how the government can completely destroy the life of a person who has done nothing wrong. No happy ending here...just doom, gloom, and destruction. I can certainly understand why this film made no money. You will too if you make the mistake of watching it."
1,A terrible movie,"This is a very bad movie. I saw it several months ago and am still angry about the time I wasted watching it. It is an insult to one's intelligence regardless of one's political bent. There are plenty of reviews of the story that detail its gaping plot holes and absolute lack of good sense and logic, so I won't repeat them here. I'll make a special point to avoid movies made by those responsible for this dreck, even the meat puppets for whom my expectations of intelligence are already low."
2,Ruined by language,"Story good, acting well done but the frequency of inappropriate language ruined it for me. Unnecessary and ruined an otherwise good movie. Watched on instant video but will not be purchasing."
4,Must-see DVD,"The smart, engrossing political thriller in the tradition of All the President's Men has a welcome female twist: two working mommies -- one a DC journalist (Kate Beckinsale), one a CIA agent (Vera Farmiga) -- cross paths on their kids' soccer field with disastrous results. Beckinsale clearly doesn't need a rubber catsuit to be terrific; she's focused, genuine, and sympathetic as the investigative reporter whose first big scoop crumples the career and family of her spook subject, with plenty of collateral damage in her own life when she goes to prison for withholding her source's name. And The Departed's Farmiga balances between dangerous adversary and wounded mother in a volatile supporting role."
3,Hard to agree,"******** SPOILER ALERT ********I have empathy for the woman who must abandon her husband and son for an ideal. I get that. Here is what I don't get: I actually disagree with the ideal. If someone releases top secret information to a reporter, the reporter SHOULD have to reveal her source. Also, as we see in the end, the source would not have gotten into trouble anyway. I liked the movie until I got to that part. It was all in vain. But great performances by Kate Beckinsale, Matt Dillon, and Alan Alda."
4,Rap Declares War,"This is way old school by now but holds up amazingly well.For those who knew and loved the band War, and who like hip hop, this is a great production!"
4,"Good, sturdy disc","This toy lasts longer than a standard Frisbee, but does not fly nearly as well and has a semi-tough learning curve to toss it and for a dog to learn the trajectory of the toy versus another disc. I was under the impression the toy would be more flimsy than it is and act almost as a towel, but it does not. It is plenty flimsy however, which my dog loves. It's also rugged as can be."
2,"DO NOT BUY!!! - Flimsy, waste of money","I have bought other 'Chuckit' products for my dog, such as the rubber balls and the ball launchers.... great products. This 'squirrel' product does NOT match up to the durability of these other Chuckit products. We have a 75lb lab who is a 'medium' chewer, and she was able to chew the plastic ends of the corners in a matter of seconds. This left small plastic pieces that could have easily choked our pet. Also, this product is good for fetch indoors, but does not cover enough space when thrown to be effective outdoors. If you have a dog who does NOT chew and likes fetch indoors, this product might be okay,"
3,"Fun toy, but not very durable","Great toy, but the durability is not ""kong"" level. Dog loved it a bit too much. 5 minutes of unsupervised play and she ripped out the hard plastic edges that allow the chuckit to fly."
4,A favorite toy,"Our 4-year-old yellow lab LOVES her flying squirrel. This is (I think) the fifth one we've purchased. Although they are very sturdy, Dani manages to eventually get the tubing to come out. She's an ace at jumping for the catch, and these fly very well and are excellent for the water. I'm ordering another one (or two!) for Christmas again this year!!"
4,Floppy Frisbee,"Our 8-month old Lab puppy loves ""Chuck"" -- but although she ""retrieves"" it, she'd rather shake it, run with it, and basically play by herself with it than give it back so I can throw it again! The bright (almost fluorescent!) colors make it easy to spot, and it seems quite durable. It doesn't seem to throw quite as far as a normal Frisbee (it may be that I'm just not a good thrower), but our puppy can destroy a regular Frisbee in minutes. In a normal backyard, not being able to throw ""Chuck"" as far as a Frisbee may not be a fault! I think it would be the perfect outdoor toy -- if only I could teach her to give it back to me..."
5,Flying Squirrel Dog Toy,This is the best throwing toy for dogs1 They LOVE them!I purchased two and should have gotten three. this is the only toy I have found that actually encourages dogs to retrieve them immediately so you can throw it again.They are a little hard to fly at first because they are so stiff but after a few days they soften up and are easy to throw.
2,Not at all durable.,"This thing is a blast and my German Shepherd really loves how it flies. It almost hovers sometimes... she could catch it 9/10 throws. Lots of fun.But... it falls apart. I didn't ever let Juno chew this thing, it was a fetch-only toy. She is an aggressive frisbee catcher, I guess, often snapping them out of the air or pouncing on it as it tumbles through its landing. Anyhow, it's weak around the 'feet' and that is where the first tear happened. From there, a similar tear afflicted the other 3 feet and eventually the feet were nearly coming off, exposing the tubes inside. Eventually one section of tube worked itself out of the fabric. It still flies as of today, but it's about 8 or 9 days old. Not exactly an economical choice. I'd recommend this if your dog doesn't actually catch the frisbee... or is extremely gentle with it when it does. Great idea, just not durable enough."
5,Best dog toy of all time.,"I buy about 3 of these a year because my border collie plays with them constantly, sleeps with it etc An excellent toy for hours of excercise, durable (stands up to chewing and tugging ) and can be machine washed and dried ..A fresh new squirrel always brings a big grin to his face. Love this toy!!!!!!!"
2,Doesn't fly like a flying squirrel,"I bought this some months back. I have yet to get this thing to fly very well. Maybe I'm not throwing it right, but it seems to just go up and then plummet back to earth. My dog likes the toy and plays with it, but my friend's dog who likes to catch frisbees in mid-air, is frustrated because it doesn't stay aloft long enough for him to catch it before it hits the ground."
2,"So many asses, so little time!","These are WWF Superstar's entrance themes, circa 1999. They serve their purpose at a wrestling arena, but how do they fare as stand alone music? Not that well, actually. Most of them are rather repetitive, with the same riff playing over and over until the fadeout. But a few of them resemble actual songs, like ""Break Down the Wall"" and ""Oh Hell Yeah"" (not particularly good songs, but songs nonetheless). ""Big"" and ""Ass Man"" are especially stupid. There is a little surprise at the end of the CD, when The Rock sing a bit of ""Heartbreak Hotel"" during the fadeout of his theme music. If you are looking for old WWF entrance themes here they are."
4,Great CD for WWF marks,"Unlike past WWF music releases, this CD contains very up-to-date themes. A lot of this stuff just plain rocks!I'd have given this CD 5 stars if they hadn't put that sucky ""Oh Hell Yeah"" song on there."
4,4 Stars for Volume 4,"This is my first WWF CD purchase and I'm more than pleased with it. Lots of energy in these songs, you can almost picture the star walking to the ring in front of 20,000 screaming fans when to put this disc on.GREAT Tracks - ""Break the Wall Down"" ""This is a Test"" ""Oh Hell Yeah"" ""My Time"" ""On The Edge"" ""Know Your Role""GOOD Tracks - ""No Chance in Hell"" ""Wreck"" ""Danger at The Door"" ""Blood Brother"" ""Wreck"" ""AssMan' ""Ministry""Not Needed - ""Big"" ""Sexual Chocolate""Big and Sexual Chocolate are the only down sides of this CD, without them its a 5 star disc."
2,i was disapointed,"I was very disapointed with this album and would not recomend it to anyone. If you want the best current WWF entrance music buy volume 3. First of all Chris Jericho's music was messed up. When he enters there is that countdown with the noise, a pause and then a big boom before the music. Well none of that is on the album. It should have been because that is what makes Jericho's entrance so great. Stone Cold's entrance was not what he's came out every time I've watched WWF, which is every Monday, Thursday, And Saturday. I have no idea what this song was unless he's about to have a new entrance song. The real current Austin song is on volume 3. ""What did everybody want?"" Al Snow's music, which wasn't on the album. there were a few good songs though, like Triple H, The Rock, Mankind, and The Corporation. Over all I was very disapointed with this album though."
2,Don't put your wallet in a choke hold over this one,The music that's played should be reconisable for striked for the indivisable on a move of the holds for the character...I think the music themes and the game play don't mixxed -up
5,Great CD,"Overall, this cd is great. It captures all the great music in the wwf at this time. I love No Chance In Hell and Assman. I love just about every song on this cd, except for the yucky Steve Austin song. I just wish that there would be more theme music on the cd for other wrestlers...like the Acolytes, Godfather, and Hardy Boys...just to name a few that were left off...but I love the cd anyways, and I recommend it for anybody."
5,Great High Energy,"This is great for when you are doing something really boring,pop this baby in!WWF The Music Vol.4 rocks!"
5,This is ATTITUDE Personified,"Finally, the Rock has taken the WWF back to the top! This CD really helps the WWF publically, cause its such a sweet album. Jericho, HHH, and (surprisingly) Christian have the best themes. And I wouldn't be surprised if the careers of the H-BLOCKX really takes off after ""OH HELL YEAH!"", which is my favorite song on the album. This CD totally lays the smack down on WCW Mayhem, just like RAW does to NITRO in the ratings every week!"
4,Another electrifying CD from WWF!,"This CD is great but it has some weak songs, i.e. Mark Henry, Ministry and Big Show. And why did they put Christian's theme in here? As far as I'm concerned, I don't think I have heard it on TV, not even once! I was disappointed that Bossman and Hardcore Holly's themes didn't make it to Vol. 4 but I hope they will in Vol. 5!"
3,An essential disk for wrestling fans only,"For what it is, this collection of WWF entrance music is fine. The genre is typically nu metal: aggressive, grinding, and sometime catchy. It is hard to seperate the quality of the music from the charisma of the performers, making this an essential disk for wrestling fans only."
2,Oh wow!,"These songs are only worthwile while watching wrestling, but alone, they aren't good at all. It's tiring hearing some entrance songs that are just pale mockups of other band's music, or just trying to be hard when they obviously aren't."
1,As a parent...........,......no thanks! The wrestling show is vulgar enough. I won't allow this CD in my home.
3,I think this CD is a great CD for any wrestling or rock fan,This CD has 14 great songs on it. This CD has 14 of the hottest super stars from the WWF's themes. Any wrestling or hard rock fan can enjoy this CD.
4,Fundamentally Zen,"Very nice, simple read. Friendly little reminder that the world is perfect just the way it is if we would only let it be, but then again, that is what we are doing after all. Learning how to be conscious of this is our challenge. This book will put you to the test."
2,Not user friendly Talk button to small!,I am very technology literate so when i cant figure something out quickly like a simple phone I am a bit disappointed! i like the way the phone looks in the picture but when i opened the box my first impression was it is small and looks cheap. the buttons are all the same size and it is not as easy as it should be to find the talk button. Simple redialing is something i still do not understand and entering numbers in the phone is a pain compared with any other cordless or cell phone i have owned. Why cant everyone be as savvy as apple when it comes to design! If you are looking for a stylish well designed phone keep looking!
3,Good Intially,I purchase this holder and it was not bad. It does not fit all chalk brands and it is difficult to advance the chalk when it is getting low.One other thing if you if you press too hard the chalk will slip back inside. This is especially true if you had it awhile.I think there are better choices out there.
3,NOT A TOY BUT A TOOL,Well to start with this is not a toy but a tool. It is good and does what it was designed to doand don't know how to answer all rate it as a toY!!!!!! But it was a gift and works well!!!!
1,none,"I wouldn't purchase this title. Afi has said several times that they had no imput into this album, that it was ONLY a Nitro Retrospective, and that they didn't really want it made."
3,Pretty Good,"This is a nice AFI collection. It has more of their old work than their new depressing stuff. O well, its still pretty good!"
1,waste...of...money,"just buy the damn cd's on their own. the only ""star"" about this is that it doesn't have anything from STS on it."
5,Not a kid...i can't be bugged with an actual account,"AFI's latest release on Nitro records--- wait...Nitro? Wasn't that their old label? Yes, meaning that AFI did not really have a say in the release of this CD. But look on the bright side, eh. THIS IS A PERFECT HIGHLIGHT OF WHEN DAVEY HAD SHORT HAIR AND CUSSED.It's quite a beautiful thing really. This is a compilation of nothing but their best, high energy songs. Theres not a single bad thing on this. And why shouldn't you buy it? It's new, it's AFI, and it's got rare songs.Only downside is, it doesn't have as many songs off their first album as I'd liek to have seen.Apprehensive? Download ""Totalimmortal"" or ""I wanna get a mohawk"" and see if you like what you hear. Great for AFI veterans and people who wanna check em out."
5,"Guys/Gals, this record was NOT released by AFI","Sure the record is great since it's composed of classic AFI songs. However the band have made it VERY clear that they had nothing to do with this record, and wouldn't have allowed a ""greatest hits"" to be released since they don't feel they wanna look at the past just yet, as they feel they're now just really getting started and looking at the high future.This record is all Dexter/Nitro, AFI had no say in it, didn't even really have an idea when it was under works, and although they don't have a huge problem with it, see nothing from it.Either way, awesome music, and can be great for all fans new/old, I just hope people don't think this is AFI releasing just to cash in as it is in fact the opposite, also I hope it doesn't get in the way of their actual new record coming out seen enough, and I think the track listing could have slightly been better."
5,Great CD To Rediscover AFI,"Alot of people became fans of AFI when Sing the Sorrow hit the charts last year. Before they were signed to major label Dreamworks AFI was on Dexter Holland's (of the Offspring) Nitro Records. The band released five full length albums, and two EPs on Nitro records. This CD takes songs from each album, starting with 2000's The Art of Drowning and working back to 1995's Answer That and Stay Fashionable. Not only that but the CD also has three songs that were never before released on CD, including Rolling Balls, which is an extremely hilarious song.I have to say that I am impressed with the band's choice of songs for this CD. All of my favourites (except Wester) are included. AFI's self titled album offers new listeners a taste of every CD the band released prior to Sing the Sorrow. Old fans will not only find it a great addition to their collection, but will also enjoy the three rare tracks that are included. BUY THIS CD!"
4,Slim Jim (Mild) Flavor - 15 Count Can,"Personally, I prefer the 'hot' kind but the mild one is good too. Simply delicious chewy meat sticks that I wouldn't recommend consuming more than - say two of these at one sitting (for obvious reasons). Here, you get fifteen of these beef jerky goodies to enjoy. Good to munch down while watching late night TV, listening to your left over voice mail messages, waiting for a call you think you might not get, etc."
4,Great Symphonic Metal,"Often compared to Cradle of Filth only because Cradle is more widely known and you can't compare Theatres Des Vampires anyone, you can only contrast. The truth is Theatres Des Vampires are one of the most original bands yet. Tracks like ""Vampirica"" and ""Dracole Waid"" really show that, screaming at the top of your lungs and extremely fast drum beats, isn't necessary for high-quality metal. If your looking for something new and aren't sure what to get, this is something you won't be dissapointed with."
3,Gothic Horror Metal,"Latest full length studio ablum from these up and coming Italians. This is full of vampiric atmosphere and ghostly eerie backdrops that gives it a gothic/ horror style. Lots of Cradle of Filth like language, with perversity about weird sexual vampiric and satantic driven fantasies. Many songs contain choirs and beautiful keyboard melodies which strenghtens the haunting voice of Lord Vampyr. This is a must have for fans of Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir."
5,"I was blown away by the Mystic Upbeat sound ""Of What May Be""","I have followed Creeping Myrtle for some time now. I am really impressed with the way both their lyrics and sound has evolved. I really enjoy how original their music is. I really enjoy the entire album. But ""Of What May Be"" just mesmerizes me."
4,"Good, but...","As others have said, this is a classic manga--many of the CLAMP titles published by TokyoPop are I think required reading for real fans of Japanese comics.There appear to be instances of bad retouching in the book--overstruck characters or text bleeding out of word balloons and the like. They don't detract from enjoying the book too much, but they are a small nuisance. Hopefully TokyoPop will fix this in later editions.Also, fans of Clamp's artwork should check out the chapters of Rayearth that appeard in the old Mixxzine (Mixx being the company that later became Tokyopop). The magazine printed CLAMP's artwork at a full page 8-1/2 by 11 inch format, and it's amazing to see how CLAMP's work fills a page. The small manga format is handy, but it doesn't do their rich artwork much justice."
5,Great book for a person who loves the history of tanks.,"""The Encyclopedia of Tanks and Armored Fighting Vehicles: From World War I to the Present Day"" it's a great book with nice photos aimed not at tanks experts but mostly for those who just want to know more about the history and evolution of the tanks and armored fighting vehicles."
4,Rhino does it again...,"Interesting 44 song history of the band. When they stuck with the soul/rock they were awesome but in my opinion they strayed into psychedelic and political music and even a concept album too often just to be trendy while they should have stayed true to their roots. Rhino does it again with 50 pages of history, background on every song and liner notes by Lenny Kaye."
4,"Almost,but,not quite.","This would be the best Young Rascals anthology if it wasn't for Rhino's idiotic , inexplicable monomania,namely,they release everything they can in Mono.The very idea of releasing ""Good Lovin'"" in mono , which obviates the impact of the ping-pong count off opening , is beyond stupid and down-right criminal.There are a few other monophonic abortions here which mar an otherwise great set.Caveat emptor!"
2,I'm sticking with the Ultimate Rascals,"I thought I'd check this out after hearing cuts played on WDET FM Detroit, on the Willie Wilson program. I bought the Ultimate Rascals over a decade ago and have always been happy with it. It's got 20 songs, everything I wanted to hear from them. By the way, after hearing The Royal Guardsmen do ""Baby Let's Wait"" this Rascals version sure pales in comparison. I guess I was looking for a complete box set with everything they ever did and after looking at some of these reviews I think I'm better off sticking with the Ultimate Rascals. And what is up with some of these reviewers' spelling errors? You people can't even spell a simple three letter word, you need to go back to kindergarten. I see ""to"" where too should be, ""there"" instead of their, and ""their"" in place of they're. Excuse me for being so blunt, but that's just plain ..."
3,NOT RHINO's FINEST MOMENT,"Typically if it says RHINO on the back it's an absolute certainty that the audio quality is going to be perfect or close to it.Not the case with this Anthology.The good news is that it DOES sound better than the dreadful ""Ultimate Rascals"" release which bears the old school late 80's mastering. BUT somehow, Bill and the boys had a tough time with The Rascals. Are the original masters in that bad of shape?Also, where is ""Hold On""? The last great single by the group is not on the Anthology. (Peaked at #29 Cashbox / #51 Billboard)Surely one of those 2nd tier filler cuts could have been dumped for one of the Rascals better moments of funk.The Rascals comp that includes ""Hold On"" is the budget priced ""Groovin and Other Hits""."
3,could have been so much better,"I was so excited when this set came out. Rhino was involved, so I expected the collection to be nonperil, with outstanding sound quality. Rhino doesn't disappoint very often, but they certainly did with this collection. Many songs are in mono, and the sound quality is wretched. What happened, Rhino?I'm so disappointed with this that I'm going to try The Ultimate Rascals, a 20 song single disc collection.Shame on you, Rhino, for giving such a great sixties band such abysmal treatment!"
4,"All the DVD,s I enjoy","All the DVD,s are very good, all of which I will enjoy watching over the years to come. Thank you"
5,The Duke,"Yes, I am a John Wayne fan and have been since I was a little child. My parents encouraged us to watch The Duke in cowboy, army, and other movies.The Hellfighters is one of our favorite movies. My husband and sons can relate to it as they have careers in the gas industry working with dangerously high pressures. The War Wagon and Rooster Cogburn have been on my list to buy forever....Such classics....."
5,Best book on Taharah Hamishpacha,"This is the book that has revolutionized the instruction of Family Purity and Jewish marriage - across the world.Rebbetzin Tehilla Abramov, the renowned instructor to more than 30 thousands of kallah teachers around the world, is the founder of the Jewish Marriage Education Network. [...]Her book sensitively details the Taharas HaMishpacha halachos, with insights to their beauty and wisdom. Appreciate how these laws have a powerful effect on a woman's femininity and the stability of her marriage. Add the moving, true stories - and you have an essential read for every kallah and married woman."
1,Very poor service,"I ordered a VAIO desktop computer. It arrived broken, no big deal, I sent it back, the replacement was never shipped. They lost is at their dock. I had to call every day for three weeks to get the refund for the first computer and to try and find the second computer. I was told something different every time I called. I was continually assured that the replacement computer would ship the next day. I finally got sick of their games and cancelled the order entirely, and I am still waiting for my money back. Would never do business with tiger again."
4,Soundly built,"This was a gift - but I did hook it up for the receiver and the cable seems decently made,"
2,Never Received!,"I never received my product. Although the Ace Hardware Outlet was very responsive, and they did refund my money, it was very cumbersome to have to deal with many emails and phone calls with the United States Postal Service, my local post office, and Ace Hardware Outlet."
2,Ho Hum This Book Is Dumb,"I went through the table of contents highlighting the areas I was interested in. I found many of the sites down or useless to me since I am not an American. All told out of 1001 things to do, I found only 23...........ho hum. It makes a good library donation."
3,MIrror Review,"Bought the mirror for my boyfriend. He said to give it three stars because it still fogs up and the size of the mirror is quite small. For what it's worth, it is quite cheap and it does serve its purpose."
4,Zadro Z300 Wall Mountable Fog Free Mirror,"Works well for the price. Falls off the wall every now and then and fogs up due to soap scum etc after a few weeks, but can't argue for the price."
3,too small...,"that's what she said.now that i got that out of the way, this mirror was far smaller than i had thought it to be. although i hadn't checked the dimensions before buying because i was desperate to reach my the minimum for free super savers shipping. this wasn't worth the money, ross and marshals have similar products that are larger and with lights for the same price. what really upset me was finding the same mirror on clearance at kmart for only a dollar! but that might not be a deal people can replicate.final thoughts:does what it says it does but is too small and over priced."
2,"Works well at first, but peters out over time.","I've had this mirror for about a month, and I've had no issues with it. I have it mounted in the shower, and I actually had a good bit of difficulty getting the suction cup off of the wall to be able to move it. The suction cup has been rock solid for me. The mirror tends to collect a little fog at first, but throwing hot water on it takes care of the fog instantly for the rest of my time in the shower. The mirror also has a little bit of magnification to it, which was a nice little surprise.Edit: After having this mirror up in the shower for about 7 months about 50% of the silver lining has disappeared (about a quarter from each edge), so only half of the mirror is still actually a mirror. I have changed my rating from 5 stars to 1 star, and when I soon replace the mirror, it will be with a different product. At least the suction cup is still of good quality! After 1.5 years there's almost no silver lining left (see image)."
1,Foggy Zardo Mirror,"Don't buy! Don't buy! Don't buy! It fogs up faster than you can say, ""Hey, I can't see anything in this foggy mirror."" Waste of money!!!! Total Waste."
4,Good product for the price,"Item was as expected. Others have complained about the suction cups not working, but have had no such problem. Satisfied with product. Company has GREAT customer service."
2,try again,"Small, the anti fog coating erodes over time and has to be ""replenished"" with a provided tube of goo.The single suction cup was also not strong enough this fell off the tile about once every 3 months."
2,Mirror is ok,"The vacuum holder does not stick at all, to any surface. I have decided to hold it because it falls every single time I try to mount it on the wall"
2,Just ok,"This item is very lightweight because it is made entirely of plastic. The mirror itself is thin plastic so it flexes and is not perfectly flat, which means it's like trying to shave in a fun-house mirror - one orientation makes the face tall and thin, 90 degree turn and the face is comically wide. One wouldn't think that's a problem until you're about to put a razor against your skin and it's hard to judge exactly where the blade is about to land.The fogging isn't an issue for me because I prefer to hold the mirror in my other hand and dunk it in the shower stream if it does start to fog.If you're accustomed to the heft and fidelity of a flat glass mirror, you'll find this one difficult to adapt to."
2,Zadro,So small. Its exactly what you pay for. And there is still fog when you put it on shower. Its Cheap and gets the job done. Its all it really matters.
3,just alright,"this is an OK product. Doesn't really stay ""fog free"" for very long. Useful, but could be better for sure."
2,"quality conscious buyer, try something else","There is nothing to appreciate regarding quality, but it is the cheapest among the competitor product. I am using it and feel it is not even fully fog free."
2,Eventually will be spotty and foggy,"I liked this when I first used this, It lasted for a year and would clear upon putting water on it and stay clear for a bit while in a hot shower. But after a year it no longer stays clear very well and it stays spotted & foggy even if you splash water or wipe it with cleaner.It was good while it lasted and the suction cup did a good job of holding on the tile surface of the shower.I suppose it did its job for the time. Also, it is smaller than you might expect."
2,Not what I expected,"This mirror is a LOT smaller than what I thought it would be. That's okay. But, what is not okay is that the mirror is rather distorted. I do not see a clear picture when I look into it. Its fuzzy and it distorts my face. Its just not what I expected it to be. Thankfully, it didn't cost too much. I will be looking around for something different."
1,STAY AWAY!,"This mirror is so bad, it's not even a real mirror, it's a plastic mirror, that can make your face shape changes depending on the angle you lift your mirror! It's so cheap and is distorted when you lift it away of your face. Don't buy!"
1,Won't Stay on the Wall,"This arrived 2 days ago and yesterday my husband tried it for the first time. The suction cup held onto the (very smooth) shower tile for about 20 seconds before the mirror fell. The mirror and the frame parts (including the decorative parts on the top and bottom of the frame) all separated. He finally found them all and put it back together. (The mirror got scratched, but didn't break.) He tried it on all the other smooth surfaces in the shower, but the suction cup would not hold to anything. It's being returned today."
4,Does the job fine,"My mirror has had no trouble staying mounted on the shower wall. It does the job fine, especially for the price. I suppose it's a little smaller than I thought it would be, since it's only 4x4 including trim. The slight magnification is a nice feature."
2,It's okay,Mirror is okay. Cheap manufacturing but it works.Suction cup is a joke; doesn't stick to anything. You'll have to hold it up if you want to get any use out of it.
4,It works!,"Item was as described. Bought mainly to use the duty cycle feature to measure frequency valve on 1988 VW cabriolet. Seems to give accurate readings, easy to use. Has a harsh plastic odor that has not gone away after a few months. This makes me wonder what harmful Chinese chemical I am being exposed to when I use it. Remember, it requires a 9v battery for some functions, so get one. Probes are the pointed kind but come with gator clip adapters."
5,TV Guide: The Official Collectors Guide,I could not put this book down. The pages are filled with 3700 beautiful full color reproduction of all the digest covers from 1953 to the last issue Oct.9th 2006. I can now finally put a value on my digest collection. A fascinating book. Great job Bangzoom Publishers.Thank You
4,"Great camera, decent software","The camera works well as a stand alone device, considering the money paid. Its simple to operate, and the pictures are fine for the usual family emails, for-sale postings, etc.The software was buggy until I downloaded an upgrade to the SNAPSHOT application. Some of the time, it does not find the camera when you start it. The simple workaround is to disconnect the cable and reconnect it. The rest of the software works well with the upgrade for Windows ME and I am fairly satisfied."
4,Great inexpensive camera,"For the price, this is the best camera out there....Pros: Light weight, long battery life, inexpensive, great software, great pictures under ideal conditions.Cons: The biggest issue with this camera is that it is pretty sensitive to light and does not have a flash. With low light, the pictures come out blurry due to the long exposure time. To remedy this, you have to keep very still for a good amount of time to let the picture expose.When conditions are ideal, this little camera really shines and the picture quality is very good....It's so easy and convenient to use."
4,Great camera with a great price,"The Intel PC Pocket Camera has the greatest webcam quality out there IMHO. It is affordable with a simple and nice design. The batteries last long. The USB connection is a fast and more efficient way for this came. Very user friendly and easy to install.As a digital camera, it is best ONLY for beginners. The quality can be surprising wonderful in the right light. It's portability can let you take quick snap shots of anything quickly. It has 8MB of memory which is about 100 640x480 pics. A great digital camera for anyone starting out and to progressive onto the bigger names, like Kodak and Fujifilm.This camera is great for quick snaps while out, webcam shots and netconferencing. Great deal!"
3,Good Camera but caused an IR conflict with my TV card,"The camera, resolution, and light sensitivity is better than the other two I've tested. However, it caused an IR conflit with my TV card, and worst of all, no change was not allowed for the IR address conflict."
2,Poor Video,"I found the packaging for this camera very misleading. The ""2 minutes"" of video can only be used in 10-second clips. The video does not have sound. The quality of the video is less than expected (even for the price of the camera)."
4,Great webcam quality!,"The Intel PC Pocket Camera has the greatest webcam quality out there IMHO. It is affordable with a simple and nice design. The batteries last long.

3,Too high in carbs for many diabetics,"This cookbook seems to focus on cutting down on fats and oils, but makes only a little attempt to cut down on carbs. (All carbs convert to sugar when digested, except for the fiber part which is not digested.) Most of these recipes would raise my blood sugar too much, especially if I had a typical meal (with moderate carbs) before dessert. Many of the recipes emphasize fruit, or use fruit for some of the sweetening, rather than all sugar. Fruit may have more vitamins that plain sugar, but fructose still raises my blood sugar. The recipes use no artifical sweeteners."
5,The most important game ever created!*says in creepy Burger King ominous voice*,"Seriously, this game is layered. The factions are completely redone and beautifly executed from story board to frame in this exciting game. The quests, main story, faction or anything else never end. There is always something to do. If you like Robert E. Howards Conan books, think of those three books(at least fifty stories) mixed with a splash of DOOM3 and you will get Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion. This seriously is a great game. One review says the game is 'unecessarily gorey', okay. If the game is gory where are the falyed open hearts you covetly point out? Where are the bodies with severed legs hanging from meat hooks, or people with their faces cleaved off? There hardly is gore in this game, but intense violence was well deserved. The entire game is a slice-n-dice gamers dream. Enjoy because this game really is...The most important game ever created!*says in creepy Burger King ominous voice*"
5,The best Xbox 360 game ever!,"First off I would like to say this game dos'nt compare to God of War ,but it comes in a close second. I like the races in this game choosing one is rewarding in some cases. You can create a million possible classes that will affect the way you play your character. Lastly the freedom to move and do anything you wanna rob people go ahead you want to explore caves and old forts by all means. It does'nt matter if you beat the main quest you still got things you could do. There's no way to discribe this feeling everytime I turn on my 360. The only thing I think when playing this game is what to explore next with my Dark Elf my Fav race ever in the game. I suggest people who own a 360 should buy this game it's a must."
1,Poor,"Did not work when I got it. There were multiple scratches on it. However, the company was great in giving me a refund."
5,One of the greatest games ever made!,"I'm not exagerating when I say that this game is one of the best ever. It's purely amazing! The graphics are the best I've ever seen in a video game, the storline is fantastic, and the quests are unforgetable. If you're a fantasy and rpg nut, you defintily need to buy this game. You'll get at least 100 hours of actual gameplay out of this puppy. It's one of those games that you get more game for your money.Even if you're not a huge rpg fan, you still have to play this game. It will blow you away!"
1,Ruined My Lifw,"I loved oblivion while I played it. But, it is way to long. It ruined my life. I didn't eat, I didn't hang with my friends, and I didn't sleep. This game is addictive. A few days ago I was 150 hours in and I deleted my file. I was so proud. Now I'm free. This game is perfect for those with no friends and life. It started to get repetitive, but I still played for countless hours a day."
3,I dont know what all of the fanfare was about.,I don't see why all of the reviews thought that this game was great. The game mainly consists of a bunch of wandering around and once you actually go into the hell type of environment there is very little variety on the monsters and it is way to hard. Also I think that the inventory system is clunky. Pretty much a general rule that I follow anymore is that any game that is touted for having the best graphics on the market is usually just a piece of eye candy with nice visuals but boring game play that gets old very fast.
5,Hold on,Okay well... i never have played this video game but it looks really really cool. I plan to buy it today after i get out of class. I am very excited. My best friend trevor hemish and I are planning to stay up all night playing it(but he has to watch) hehehe. I can't even consentrate at all durring school (thats where im at right now) becuase i am so excited to play this game.PS: love you mom(Happy Birthday)
3,Oblivion Vs Morrowind,"After playing both Oblivion and Morrowind, they both have there pros and cons. Oblivion blows Morrowind out of the water with the graphics, but the game play is almost exactly the same. The story line in Morrowind is WAY better though. It took me almost 6 months to beat every quest in Morrowind and i've already beat Oblivion in under 2... a lot of the quest are eaither the same or almost the same as they were in Morrowind. The creators said that they ""Started Over"" with Oblivion with the quest and story line. altho you start the game the same(as a prisoner). Its like they just took Morrowind and changed the world and made the Graphics better. and the fact that when you are doing a quest the game tells you EXACTLY where you need to go for you mission... Morrowind wasnt like that, you had to work for what you earn. Oblivion is a great game i'll give it that. but Morrowind is a much much better RPG."
1,defective,defective parts - cant reach the companty by phone. Lets see what happens when I try to reach them by email to return these defective parts
1,Useless,"I have gotten away from writting reviews, but I needed a forum to vent my dislike for this book. Fortunately for me, I borrowed a copy from the library. I cannot imagine paying anything for this book. I do not understand the point of the book. I only used listings that had websites and I found them all to charge as much as a local vendor for their products. How this is supposed to be wholesale is beyond me. For auto parts it lists only one site and they were higher than local stores. They listed a textbook selling site that supposedly charges cost, again I can do much better right here at Amazon. I was hoping to find a book telling me how to buy things at wholesale prices, then I would resell them and make extra money. This book told me how to buy things at retail prices, which I had already figured out on my own. I just cannot understand why this book was published."
1,Don't bother,"We purchased this DVD based on the above two positive reviews. We are planning a trip to Greece in several months. We found this DVD to be so tedious and boring that we almost wish we weren't going. It goes out of its way to show badly videographed scenes of tourist sites way too crowded with cheeseball tourists and ancient monuments covered in scaffolding. Interspersed are interviews with native Greeks who share insights like, ""Athens is one of the most beautiful capitals, because it is beautiful and has beautiful buildings."" Or ""I ride a motorcycle because it is very crowded and smoggy and I think the only way to get around is a motorcycle because I like motorcycles."" I am grateful we bought this DVD used and didn't bother to watch the whole thing. Thank God we're going to the islands. Maybe there will be fewer scaffolds and fewer irritating people."
4,Great but easy to lose,"This is a great product, extremely durable, waterproof, and super fast. I like it so much that I'm here buying my second one, even though I now know there is a flaw -- the case is very round, and if you drop the device on an inclined surface, it will roll away. That is how I lost my first one, by dropping it in a parking garage. Probably keeping it attached to the included dog-tag style chain or something like that would prevent this problem from happening again."
2,Biggest disapointment,"It is not as fast as expected. I talked to the Corsair and they ere willing to replace it but would not guaranty the speed. I was also told that they are using a slower memory type now. I belive they switched to SLC from MLC or vice versa.I am still using it but I wish I would not waste my money. Recently when my friend heard this story and saw the drive, he chocked on his food at the moment I told the price."
4,Will Have To Do Until The Real Thing Comes Along,"I bought this CD only because it was the only place to find most of the material from Doug's 1973 Atlantic recording Doug Sahm and The Band. That album featured the likes of David Bromberg, David ""Fathead"" Newman, Flaco Jiminez, Dr John and the infamous Robert Zimmerman. With a cast of legends such as this, it was nearly impossible to live up to the hype. However, I think that session produced more than it's share of standouts. Faded Love, San Antoine, Dealer's Blues and Dylan's great composition Wallflower are all praiseworthy.I did find a copy of Doug Sahm and The Band reissued on the Edsel label. So it's out theresomewhere. Until then, look to this Rhino collection to fill in the gaps."
4,aint given you one red copper cent,"the blues tunes on this disc are pure doug. your friends, san francisco fm blues, and aint that lovin you are as good as it gets. this is the stuff doug used to lay down at the old soap. i can still see him with hat and fender pushing his glasses higher on his nose, telling jack barber or rocky morales how he wanted something done-without missing a lick. there are other good tunes here. if you are a DOUGIE fan you should pick it up."
4,Love Him or Hate Him,"dixon is a one-in-a-kind writer. a friend pointed out to me: he's either doing something radical or just doing something no other writer wants to do. so love him or hate him, he's the type who doesn't give a damn. this book, like most of his other novels, could be quite torturous to read, but the reader will find it rewarding upon finish reading it."
3,"A Long, Strange Trip Indeed","Dixon's INTERSTATE is an intersting read...a novel that held my interest even though I didn't think it could. Confusing at first, but soon finds it's own rhythm, and begins to work on a complete unique path of logic. The first work of Dixon's I've read, I will probably attempt to read the masive FROG, based on the weird strength and twisted characterization found in INTERSTATE."
5,Best kept secret in riot grrrl!,"These adorable Chinese girls are kicking some serious ...! They were featured in the 2002 winter issue of BUST magazine. In the article it talked about how they never realized they were feminists they just knew they were really angry. They have an old school punk sound, such as the Au Pairs or Romeo Void ,but angry feminist lyrics, with a street punk twist. I highly recomend it!"
2,"Decent, but overpriced","I bought this CD a couple weeks ago and though it does fill an interesting niche it isn't totally fulfilling. the sound it pretty rough and at $29 it was a bit of a letdown. If you can find it for less than 10 it is worth a couple weeks of listening, but otherwise your money would best be spent elsewhere."
3,Substituted,"The ribbon we were sent was not Nu-kote as indicated in the description but a cheaper substitute. The ribbon does work in our typewriter. However, I feel the retailer should have told us that the product they were going to send was a substitute for Nu-kote."
4,Nothing better than the classics,"I had heard of these albums for years but never listened to them. A bit before my time you know :) But purchasing their 1998 album made me very curious. These guys are timeless and hilarious, even by today's standards. I still listen to them from time to time when I need some cheering up. I have since given this set as a gift. The price is a bit high I think, but well worth it. I will always have these CDs in my collection."
4,It is still Carl and Mel,"As huge fans of this incredible duo, I was a bit disappointed by these recordings. They really sound like they were recorded at a private party, which I understand was how the 2000 year old man shtick came to be. Not quite as riveting as I had thought it would be."
4,"I like nectarines, too.","Being funny on the spot isn't easy, but Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner succeed marvellously. At its best the collection is striking, at its worst it is at least more than moderately amusing."
1,MP3 link is Bait and Switch,The MP3 link here does not get you the complete product. After you pay and download you find you get only the last album and it does not even include the bonus track!
1,The 2000 year old man,I thought it was great. I had just seen the musical 'The Producers' while in London so decided to get the full set plus two others. Hilarious. I do get funny looks from car drivers when while waiting for the lights to change I am laughing my head off. This is my sense of humour. Thanks for your great service.
4,Great comedy!,"Great improvisational comedy by Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner. Stands up to the test of time, but some of the humor will be lost on people under about 30. Still, very enjoyable for most listeners. I played it for my teen son and friends. They enjoyed the 10 minutes I played for them. Great for a road trip."
5,Good original country song the way country music used to be!,These songs are more like old original country songs. It is not like the new country songs. Album with music to sing along with!
3,Not so Ultimate,"This is the 4th primer I've tried, and I think that a good moisturizer works just as good as this does, and costs a whole lot less. I was not impressed at all with the product, with the feel, or the lasting power. It dried out after about 8 hours, leaving my foundation flaking in spots. So I mix it with my moisturizer when applying. But when it's gone, I won't buy any more."
1,Lalique: The glass of René Lalique (A Rizzoli paperback,"I would like to know more about this title please.How many pictures?Pictures of what? Jewelry, perfume bottles, Vases, assorted ?Thank youRegards,Robert"
4,Very Heavy Cables At Affordable Price,The Hosa XLR cables are affordable and very heavily made.I have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhere.I decided to purchase shorter cables and the Hosa cables 5ft measurement worked perfectly.You really will not be disappointed with these.
5,A stinky treat,"My dogs love this dog food supplement even though it smells anything but good to me. A couple of spoonfuls will make the dry dog food go down. The cans open easily and it stays fresh in the fridge for two- three days. It is not cheap, but it is worth the expense to see the otherwise finicky dogs enjoy their meals and get the right nutrition."
4,Considering...,"...that this is the only in-print bio on Vincent, I have to say this is an excellent book. Despite the tone of the writer at times to try to seem ""country,"" and her habit of not really pointing out too many specific dates (or years even!), I did enjoy this. The extensive after-notes, and interview list were quite impressive and obviously a lot of research went into it. I guess I just wish it seemed more in depth than it read. It will definitely do for now..."
3,Interesting but lame,"Well written, nice stories, but not so realistic and honest I would have liked. Britt Hagarty's earlier biography is much better. This newer bio included some nice interviews transcribed from radio though. They show how seriously ""out"" Gene was at the end of his career."
4,Get it for less at a legitimate listing!,"Will the Circle Be Unbroken, Vol. 2There is no reason to pay so much for this CD.Go to the above link and buy used or even brand new copies of this CD for much less.Why no customer reviews at this listing? Hmmm."
3,"Good Rudimentary Introduction, but...","I learned a good deal of ""basics"" information from this book, which I suppose it what the author intended. However, there was also a good bit of information which I found lacking or not fully explained. For instance, although the author gives you a basic idea of how to determine the degree of aspect when two planets are in conjunction, he isn't particularly clear in advising how to determine aspects that spread across signs. For instance, you'd be left to thinking that you could count HOUSE PLACEMENTS rather than SIGNS to determine the degree of aspect, which is not true. Also, the ""interpretations"" in the last half of the book are very general and tend to become tiresome...so much so that I had to push myself to finish the book. Taken on the whole, it's still a worthy work for someone like me who's baseline knowledge was largely peripheral, but you may have to seek other sources to expound on what he does not explain."
5,Perfect book for the uninitiated,"I picked up this book about 10 years ago. At the time I had about as much knowledge of astrology as you can get from the newspaper i.e. none. It is chock full of information about just about everything. Particularly useful for students starting out is getting familiar with the houses and the signs as they affect factors in your life, not just your overall personality. It does lack some information on nodes but for a beginner's text, that is just fine.I have continued to study and now am an astrologer. I have a considerable library but I still find I use this book for many different reasons. The organization is great and the concise explanations are a godsend. I cannot say enough how glad I am to have bought this book when beginning my studies."
2,"soo basic too basic infact, even for the beginner","This book is ok, but im not too keen on the way he writes - or more precisely the way he views people. He tends to put down those who are different from him, where as other astrologers tend to focus on the difficulties you are experiancing and how to overcome them.The interpretations are about 3 sentances long and to be honest its not really worth the money.I brought parkers astrology which covers the same things and far more for around the same price. I recomend you look into getting this one instead - its great value and also a brilliant resourse for other basic elements of astrology. Plus - its understandable for the beginner. You could also create a birth chart free on line at astro.com and use the parkers book to interpret it. (I sent off the free birth chart voucher that W. Hewit gives you about 6 months ago and still havent recieved it)"
5,transformers,too cool - was received safely and enjoyed - thanks and sorry for the delay in letting you know -
2,doesn't make any sense.;...,"...to have episodes 1-4 on one dvd and 6-9 on the other dvd,what happened to episode #5? sorry like the armada seriesI'm going to wait for a box set of this before even thinking about getting this series,the dvds for energon and armada makes no sense,I will say that energon is slightly better than armada but not much better,at least the animation is better..."
5,Hooray for Hollywood,"As a resident of Los Angeles and a lover of film and the history behind it, this book has been a source of hours of late night reading that lead to hours of next day exploring. You will be amazed to find that your favorite coffee shop sits on a site that was once the location of a great epic or that Cecil B DeMille lived in your neighborhood. this book gives a context and history to Los Angeles and Hollywood that is often forgotten in the current obsessions that the city is associated with today. Not only will you find the address and locations of many famous film locations and movie studios but you will also begin to see the picture of how Hollywood developed and understand the important American cultural history that lies therein.Keep it in the Glove box of your car or next to your bed or both. Truly enjoyable to the resident or the visitor."
4,An Updated Version Of One Of My Favorites,"In the late '80's, I went into Dutton's in Manhattan and found this book as well as its companion piece: New York: The Movie Lover's Guide. Both books got quite a workout on my travels to both coasts and showed a lot of wear including crayon marks from the kids. I often wished I had extra copies of both to pass on to my movie crazy friends. Fast forward 20 years. The kids are out of the house and a new and improved version of both books are available at the bookstore. What makes this book particularly endearing is that it doesn't focus on a particular era of film making/celebrity......it covers it all! Whether you are interested in knowing where Laurel and Hardy filmed THE MUSIC BOX or where Howard Hughes maintained his LA offices, it's all here. This is a great book for the merely curious or the die hard movie fanatic and definitely a must-have for the armchair traveler."
3,The Secret of Mirror Housr,"While I enjoyed the book, it was not up to the excellent standard usually typical of Jennifer Blake. I still recommend it for an unusual and gripping story."
4,Power Probe 2,This is a very handy tool for troubleshooting. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it had a screen like the power probe 3. It uses lights instead.
3,Love the series,Maybe not my favorite of all the books in the series but definitely worth reading the series. Good story overall
4,Keeps you thinking!,"Laura McKay was a widow with a deaf daughter, trying to make their way in a world that seems big, cold and expensive! Ryan Flanagan was a firefighter, trying to find his own way in a family of firefighters, afraid to make a mistake that could hurt someone. Both had turned away from God in their own way. Laura struggled to turn the old building into a saleable apartment and shop so that she could pay for Mandy's cochlear implant surgery. There's an arsonist afoot, can Ryan find out who it is and stop them before his new boss arrests Laura?I found this book especially interesting,Having had both had my husband pass away when my daughter was 2 and having friends on both sides of the cochlear implant debate."
5,Love Limes,"I'm new to the world of wet shaving so my experience with different products is extremely minimal, but I LOVE the T&H; Lime after shave. I got a sample of it from my barber and immediately after trying it ordered a bottle through Amazon Prime.The scent is fantastic, and seems to go perfectly with other products. I love it alone as well as with Ogallala Bay Rum, Blue Sugar, and Hanae Mori HM colognes.Being new to wet shaving, and using some extremely sharp Feather blades, I tend to go overboard from time to time and get my face raw. T&H; aftershave balm is amazing at soothing my burning face after a too aggressive shave, it's almost like magic.I've tried the T&H; Indian Limes cologne as well and was NOT impressed, but this balm is great."
4,Essential early Oates,"The other reviewer is right on: Oates recent work (We Were the Mulvaneys, Middle Age, etc.) feels overly safe in comparison to this novel. J.C. Oates fans should definitely try and pick up this book somewhere to see what she's really capable of. It's horrifying yet impossible to put down."
3,Two out of three,"Fear is violent, it keeps you interested til the end when Mark Wahlberg gets what he deserves. The second movie 'The Watcher' makes you not want to watch it a second time. The character played by James Spader is dull. And the third film 'Raising Cain' turned me off simply because I can't stand watching a movie where one actor plays several different roles. This movie remined me of people who go around talking to themselves."
1,"Worst music all time, that's a big call",It's that bad seriously. I don't know how someone could seriously produce this crap and try to sell. I wish Wesley Willis was around to kick this guy's ass.
3,Not P.T. Amazon .,Got an e.mail from Amazon saying because I've been buying cd's by Porcupine Tree & Steven Wilson I may be interested in Steven Wilsons latest release.....Luckily I checked before buying - This is quite obviously not Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree.Please Amazon - Its not too difficult is it ? I buy Dr.Who dvd's but dont want books or dvd's about Doctors ! Perhaps a little bit of the human touch would be nice from Amazon's e.mails & a little common sense. [Had to give a rating so gave 3 for no reason so ignore this rating]
4,good hardwood floor cleaner,"This is a good hardwood floor cleaner. I use it with theRubbermaid Reveal Spray Mop Kit, FG1M1600GRYRD. It is my second choice and almost as good as my first, but they don't make my first choice anymore. I used to use ""Orange Glo"" Hardwood Floor Everyday Cleaner, but they changed the formula and it now feels sticky with a soapy residue.My floors feel clean with the Armstrong cleaner, not sticky like most cleaners I have tried. I use it once a week after vacuuming and for spot cleaning after a liquid spill."
3,Not as good as a my last case from this company,"I had a case from this company for my old Samsung Omina, and it was AWESOME, I'd give it a 5+ stars. The same can't be said for their Droid X case. The phone doesn't sit squarely in the case, the case blocks the top pull down menu, and the case partially covers the charge port.I cut the little strap of leather below the earpiece speaker so I could easily access my pull down bar. The charger port van still be accessed with the case on, but not easily. And the case isn't exactly a good fit to the phone.pros.material qualityBuild qualitycons.fitdesignThere is a similar case from a company called Fortte. I may try theirs out"
2,Mother of Pearl Pendant,I waited a long time to order this pendant and was disappointed. The gold latch is a little too large and the stone is a very poor piece. It has several different colors and grains going in different directions with different kinds of shines to it. It is not a smooth white piece like the picture.
2,short on effective scares,"Make that short on acting skills as well.The Ferryman is nothing short of an *extremely* underwhelming film. The entire first half is basically nothing but a big party on a boat containing unimportant and totally useless conversations between all the characters.I've been disappointed by horror flicks before, but at least even the worst ones offer *something* interesting from time to time.I can't recommend the Ferryman to anyone except the most dedicated of fans who admire scary storylines involving ships and oceans. Just a total disappointment. Even Ghost Ship was better than this."
4,One major chunk of not thinking things through,"It's always good to make sure the seller and product are kept apart, so that reviewing one does not affect the other. In this case the seller was prompt, logical, and delivered quickly, one of the reasons to buy here, but the movie was mostly interesting, some fairly good effects, and had a huge, central to the story flaw in the how and why of the title character's actions within the film. Down Under horror, interesting, but with a major flaw in thinking it through before they shot."
2,So So,"Good for a rental only. I tend to love horror movies involving water/boats, but this was a letdown. It kept my attention, but the characters and story were just not that interesting or engaging. The story concept is very old - a spirit bouncing through bodies."
1,"Charon, we barely knew ye","I have seen worse. Not much worse, but worse. I have to say that I was disappointed with the lack of screen time given Charon, the fabled Ferryman of the dead. The movie does a fair job of establishing the mood after a strange opening sequence. Once the film starts progressing after John Rhys-Davies' character comes aboard, the plot unravels and never regains its bearings."
5,Nice Surprise,"Since there was no picture with the product I took a chance. I am very pleased. It matches the scarlet, black, white, and I hope the new evergreen."
5,Photographic Cases: A Must-Have for Collectors & Dealers,"This book is a visual delight packed with absorbing, well-written text, a generous sampling of over 460 illustrations, descriptive captions, and values. Adele Kenny infuses her subject with lively and energetic writing and approaches case art from both historical and design perspectives. Thus, the book is a valuable and important resource for photographica enthusiasts, Victoriana and Americana collectors, dealers, artists, and interior designers. This book is impressive for its readability, its content, and the quality of its illustrations."
3,Not recommended for the first time basenji owner...,This book went on a bit about specific basenjis and their blood lines. I found it a bit technical to tell you the truth. The first couple of chapters were excellent though where the author describes the personality of the fabulously independent basenji dog. Probably great if you are a breeder or seriously into the history of the basenji.
1,Cookie Cutter,"Very disappointed. The designs are simply ranch style homes with barrel-tile roofs. The book is divided into four sections: Italian, French, English and Spanish but they are literally the same plans in all sections with just simple modifactions to the front facade. Worse yet, most designs mix elements from all styles. You get a simple floor plan with a watercolor elevation that is often not completely reflective of the design. I particularly noticed that most designs had very large garages that are not rendered proportionally. If you are looking for unique designs that are true to the architecture of Europe this is not the book to buy. If you just want a ""Spanish Look"" to a ranch design this book offers nothing different than what you can find in the check out line of the local super-market. There is nothing unique or authentic in this book."
2,Disappointed!,"The cover claims that there are 65 floorplans, but its more like 22. The same floor plans are shown with different facades for each section. I also would have hoped that the photographs from the front of the book would have been from homes built using the various floorplans, but from what I can tell none of the pictures correspond to a floorplan. Which is too bad, considering the homes pictured were what I was looking for.The renderings are beautifully done, but hardly worth the price.You may want to consider another title before you purchase this one."
3,Reference materials,"I use the book as reference material to work on my house, it give a little help for me only."
2,Disappointing,"I've read most of the Sater books and this is the only one that I feel didn't give me my money's worth. This is supposedly 80 plans but is, in reality, 18-20 plans repeated with a different facade to fit the particular chapter's influence. Also, of the plans that are here, many have been done elsewhere in his other books. Stay away from this one unless you know going in that you'll be getting the same house again and again with a different face."
3,Haven't really used much,Thought we'd use it more than we do. Use a folding aluminum riser instead for most indoor tasks. Maybe it will get put to the better use for outdoor painting and re-roofing the shed.
2,Very cheap quality,"I guess I was expecting more than just the disks! There was no packaging or anything, just three tiny disks in the envelope! They looked like the free things you get from the car wash. I was expecting a better quality product. The smell is as expected and I know these things were cheap - but they are just surprisingly lacking!"
4,Don't know why this gets negative reviews,"Put this in my doggy ""diaper pail"" over a month ago, and my super-sensitive nose is amazed at how well it works. Wish it had a self-mount."
4,smells good works good,"I have the diaper pail in my room and I never smell the stink, these fresheners work great it has been 3 months and I am still using the same disk"
2,"Smells great, but doesn't last long","These discs smell great when you first take them out of the package. I've had a disc in my diaper pail for just over a week, and the deordorizing effect is gone already. The description said each disc should last 3-4 weeks. Not even close. I will never buy these again."
2,Not worth it,"I know these are cheap, but they didn't help with the horrible diaper odor. I would not recommend spending your money on these items. When I opened up our diaper pal there was still a bad smell."
4,deodorize well,I think they work great to mask some of the smell of the nasty diapers. My husband doesn't like the scent... but he never likes any scents. Fits well in our Safety First simple diaper pail.
2,Only Slightly Better Than Nothing,"I bought these to use with my Safety 1st diaper pail with disposable diapers. They fit very nicely in the diaper pail lid, which is nice. And they smell good, a little like oranges. But they barely work. For about the first week, the orange smell is very overwhelming in the nursery. After that, the room smells like a combination of oranges and stinky diapers with the stinky diaper smell finally winning out completely by week 3. I guess they work okay, but not by deodorizing or neutralizing any smells. It just has a very strong smell in itself. There has to be something that works better than these things. I'm going to keep looking."
1,Don't waste your money here!,Bought these for use in my cloth diaper pail. They smelled horrible and did not deoderize anything. Very disappointing. Just glad I only bought one package to try first!
1,Deodorizers?,"I popped open the plastic and enjoyed the way the disk smelled, but when put into a diaper bucket, the scent was overwhelmed. I must conclude that these were designed to deodorize paper diaper buckets, and not cloth diaper buckets."
4,"Way better than nothing, just change when advised","Okay, right now I've had the same disk in the diaper pail for about a month, and at this point it has lost all its noticeable scent, but when I first put them in, they work pretty well for the first 2 weeks, then start getting weaker. So, if you wait longer than 3 weeks they're only slightly better than nothing, but when changed as advised I find them definitely worth it. Plus I like the citrus scent-- I find it much more preferable to a perfumey scent for cutting into the smell of those stinky diapers."
1,too strong!,"I used this and my whole house smelt like it! It's not for me. If you like a citrus smell you might love it but, just to warn you it's a very very strong smell!!"
3,Nice book,"This is a good book for if you have a niece or little girl in your life that enjoys making jewelry or arts and crafts. It has simple instructions and the patterns in it allow for the person to experiment with bead styles or colors. The instructions are very detailed and step-by-step so that you can follow them. And it features the lengths of a bracelet/necklace, how to make a bead loom, and what supplies to use."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"This book is a great beginner book. If you are wanting to learn simple, well-explained projects, this book is for you. They are beginner level projects that would be perfect for children. If you've already learned beading basics, this book would be a waste of your money."
1,Bad Bad Leroy Brown,"Be wary of this book. It is not the Quickscript designed by Kingsley Read for George Bernard Shaw. No books exist on the Shaw Alphabet, or ""Shavian,"" save for one, but it's a translation of a play, and not a learning manual.If you're looking for a quickscript this is a rather lame buy. The book takes cursive writing, removes most vowels and simply destroys the letters turning a into a backwards j and so forth. If you want ""The Quickscript"" many web pages talk about it, and is a simple google search away."
5,duck hunting item,"this purchase was made at amazon for the following reason, this item was used help me do work in getting me duck blind in operational working order for this season of duck hunting."
5,These are really great for the price,"These zip ties are great. 100 is more than enough and they are cheap. Used these to tie down the landing gear for my RC Helicopter. They can be useful for tying down cables, but 4 inches might not be enough, so double check and make sure you get the right size. I am happy with my purchase."
4,Good value,"4 cents per zip tie isn't too bad, and these are fun to play with. Helpful for computer cable management, or just plain getting your order over $25."
1,NOT REUSABLE...,I bought these cable ties because they showed up in my search for REUSABLE cable ties. They DO NOT RELEASE and are not reusable. The only way to get them off is to cut them.
3,buy bigger,"If you're going to buy 100 cable ties, don't buy these... get bigger ones. I have very limited usage for these, they're too small. All the things I thought I could use them for need slightly bigger cable ties, so go for at least the next size up."
3,4 inches?!!!- tiny little suckers,"I didn't know they were quite that small. I would have like them to be a little longer. I guess I will have to use these for something else. Make sure you check the size before ordering. Always better to go longer, as you can always cut off the excess."
1,"Brittle, more than 2/3rds broke","Very brittle, I dont even think I was able to use a 1/3 of them. Locking part kept breaking even when threading through the first few bumps and this is with no tension on the ties."
1,Brittle!,Purchased these awhile back and they have been stored indoors since. Now that I am starting to use them I am finding that the locking tab breaks off before any tension is put on the cable tie. I think this must be a bad batch but they are way too brittle.
1,"Brittle, not the brand shown","I ordered Cables-To-Go brand (Model #43036) cable ties. What came were from Monoprice. If I had known that would be the case, I would have passed on the ties, since I had already had problems with brittle Monoprice ties. They really do break with a only modicum of force. It's like someone used the wrong king of plastic or something. Still they are so cheap, that it's not worth sending them back. I'm just writing to warn others..."
1,Terrible garbage,Sometimes I read reviews and think people want to just be negative and aren't willing to understand that if you pay a cheap price you will get a cheap product. On this product I was WRONG. This product is absolute trash. Not worth anything. Got it for some car audio cables. Immediately when the tail is fed through the tab inside breaks. Not just on one on all five that I tried. Do not buy unless you like having worthless plastic laying around your garage.
1,Completely worthless,"I bought several bags of these, and I just threw away the last two bags (200) unopened. These ties are so brittle that they break before you can even get them zipped. Quite a few of them have broken as I'm bending them just to wrap around the cable, never mind inserting it back into itself. By the way, these are NOT Cables-to-Go brand ties. They're an off brand (Monoprice). And I have never been so dissatisfied with a purchase through Amazon."
3,Adequate,"I'm sure these are fine for wires and cables, but don't use them for anything heavy-duty. I bought them to secure a wire basket to my bike rack (I used about 7) and most of them snapped upon hitting the first real bump of the grocery trip. Most of them broke right where the strip attaches to the square head, so it seems that's a very weak point."
5,Great product for the price!,This is a great product for the price! I cant really complain at all. It does what it is supposed to do. I highly recommend it!
1,Stale,"These were ordered from Electromaster (PRIME offering at time of order). They must have been stale, as they were brittle and 75% snapped and broke trying to use them. Very frustrating - at least they were inexpensive."
5,PERFECT!!,these came in the mail FAST! they work perfectly and are the perfect size for wire management inside my computer case. i used about 30 out of 100 zip ties and none broke unlike other reviews. what a steal for $2!!!
3,Shorter than expected,"I ordered these to better secure a reel on an old fly fishing rod. Make sure you account for the fact that the first inch doesn't have any latches/ zip the thing to latch onto... So essentially, it's a 3 inch zip tie.Even if I hadn't overestimated the above prior to buying, I'm not so sure these would have been hefty/ sturdy enough to hold my reel to the rod all day as they're a bit flimsy. Perfect for bunching up wires, but I wouldn't rely on them to bear any load."
5,They do what a cable tie do.,"These nice looking black cable ties bundle your cables nicely. At 4"" they are good for bundling small cables like audio or ethernet twisted pair cables. Clean and consistent manufacture, not like some I've seen where the mold edges were still on them. These are a pleasure to use."
1,Junk,"Should have listened to the other reviewers who said these cable ties are inferior. After the first two almost every one broke when I tried to tighten them. The package has the Monoprice brand on it and I'm kind of surprised because I've had good luck with Monoprice in the past. The package also states ""do not open until ready for use"", which tells me they have a useful life albeit short. I guess they expect you to use all 100 ties within 5 minutes of opening the package."
4,"Could be a little longer, but a great deal!","I recently had to move my house, and being an aspiring musician, I have a TON of cables to keep track of. These cable ties saved my life. I was able to move everything, and still have enough cable ties to use in my new place. They provide you with 100 cable ties. This seems like a meager number at first, but believe me its more than plenty.My only complaint is that they are a tad shorter than what I would feel comfortable using, especially with thicker, lengthier cables. I really had to compress some of my cords and cables to properly ""fit"" these ties. If they manufactured these with another 2-3 cm, they would be perfect. Still, very useful and worth the price!"
2,Color off,"Product pictured is much more of a ""cherry"" color. Item delivered was very dark and did not match other cherry furniture it was purchased to go with."
2,Cannot recommend,"I didn't expect this cable to be so thin. It's easily 1/2 the thickness of any guitar cable I've used. Not sure about long-term durability or signal loss/interference. If I had the foresight I'd spend a couple extra bucks on a thicker cable. Still, it works and was inexpensive.EDIT: 6 months later and it's dead already. Wire frayed at the right angle jack. You get what you pay for."
4,good cable,Nice cable. I've used it many times with my Les Paul. Good quality also for the price of it. I would buy another with quality this good.
5,"Evelyn Horan - author, Jeannie, a Texas Frontier Girl","A touching and beautifully presented ""love story"" of devotion, caring, self-sacrifice, and loyalty. Inspiring and uplifting. Sure to touch all readers. A must read for all!"
2,Does not mention Workshop nor Portals,"This ""Definitive Guide"" does not mention Portals/portlets nor Weblogic Workshop. I quote:""It is beyond the scope of this book to discuss how to use Weblogic Workshop in depth. It is a powerfull, comprehensive tool that provides a different route to creating applications than described in the rest of this book. (...) Creating web services ... requires coding, descriptor files and Ant build files. On the other hand, you can create web services in Workshop with a few drags of the mouse.""Great. So the most usefull feature of WL 8.1 is not even discussed. And not a word on portals. All the same, it manages to occupy a whopping 800 pages.I strongly recomend you get ""BEA Weblogic Workshop 8.1"" from SAMS publishing (ISBN: 0-672-32622-1)"
3,Hmmmm....let's see....,"First of all - I TRULY enjoyed their very first book, Trying to Sleep in the Bed You Made.I was disappointed with this one (VERY). It was too slow - it took me a month to finish it. The first book I finished in a couple of days, it kept me attention from start to finish.Far From the Tree is good...but I feel that it could have been better and more exciting.I must admit that the book does pick up in the end...close to the end. The book has good characters, a good plot but still something was missing for me.I will wait anxiously for the next one!"
5,Great Sophmore Effort,"I also enjoyed this book. Celeste and Ronnie Fraiser, two sisters different as night and day, their beloved father has died and neither one can understand their mother, Della. Good storyline, and great characters make this story worthwhile and enjoyable reading. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys stories about family misunderstandings, legacies, joy and pains and forgiveness. I hope someone can pick this book up and decide to make a movie. Read and Enjoy!"
4,Excellent book! Read it in less than 24 hours,I found this book by accident while walking through Barnes and Nobles. I was looking on the bargain table for potential Christmas gifts. I saw this book and remembered the authors name from their previous book. I found this one absolutely wonderful. I couldn't put it down. The characters were easy going but well developed. I thought I had the story down but then there were a couple of twists and surprises.I highly recommend this book.
5,family triggers,"I read this book and it was good,but Celeste and her sister Ronnie got on my nerves they made me wanna tell them off.Della was fun reading about her made me think about my own family and their land in the country and what secrets they might have had before i was born.This book was good ,but it left me wanting more and wondering what happens next. I hope the author's write a sequel i intend to write them for a sequel to this."
2,Slow Read,"Interesting plot. However, not the mystery/suspense that ""Lying in the Bed You Made"" or ""Better Than I know Myself"" had. Very slow, uneventful. Hard to finish."
2,Disappointed!!,"I guess I set myself up for this one. I had high expectations for this book because I loved ""tryin to sleep"". I had to force myself to finish this novel. It was definitely below my expectations."
2,Tired of all the Whining,"Why do AFAM books always have to whine? Why does everyone have to be so unhappy...fretting and complaining? I bought this book after hearing a co-worker sing it's praises. Far From The Tree is the second African American book that I've read and it seems that all the characters do is critique and bad mouth each other. Nothing positive seems to go on in these character's lives. The family tree is definitely rotten, growing nothing but apples with worms."
3,"Good, but a little disappointing","I am probably one of the biggest fans of Ms. Deberry and Ms. Grant; however, I must say I was just a little disappointed with this book. It wasn't bad but considering I've been waiting three years for their second work - it didn't live up to my expectations. Tryin to Sleep was such a page turner, it kept my full attention throughout the entire book whereas Far From the Tree was a tad bit slow. I almost had to force myself to pick it back up. I was curious to find out the mom's big secret but other than that no thrills in this book. Good book if you're looking for the slow, non eventful type of read. I still look forward to your future work!"
3,"This was a good book, not great , but good","I thought this book was good, it definitely was not better than ""Tryin to sleep"". It kept me reading because I was curious to find out the big secret and was a little disapointed when I found out what it was. Overall it was good."
4,Well Worth The Wait...,"My book club and I were on pins and needles in anticipation of the 2nd novel authored by DeBerry & Grant. Once it was released, and I made my purchase, I dove into it, but found myself drowning in agonzing disdain for Odella, Celeste (esp. Celeste) and Ronnie! The first chapters of the book, were too drawn out, hence 4 stars vs 5.But things began to rock & roll once the Frazier women made it to a place called HOME! As it turned out, the novel was an Njoyable read, and as indicated, was well worth the wait!"
3,More of A Mystery,"I would say that this book sort of had you guessing, ""What is Della trying to hide from her daughters?"" It was very slow to start and I had to force myself to read it, but as I read on it got a little more interesting as they would go back and forth between the past and present."
4,Excellent Story,"Far From the Tree is an emotionally charged story of family relationships and family secrets. Specifically, the authors explore the tumultuous relationships between mothers, daughters, and siblings.DeBerry and Grant created unique, yet familiar characters that literally sucked me into this story. I enjoyed the consistent and sassy personalities of Della, Ronnie, and Celeste. The authors' description and word choice give the story music. The free flowing dialogue is quip and vivid. I can still recall snippets of conversations that made me laugh, cry, and gasp.Far From the Tree is full of drama, unforgettable characters, and a speedy story line that will entertain you, yet encourage you to think about how you handle your own family perils. Enjoy!"
4,Good Reading!,"I absolutely loved ""Tryin to sleep..."" This book, however, was more realistic which could be why some felt it moved slowly. The characters and situations were people you could find in your own home or next door. Once I got into the book, I found it to be good, interesting reading and I was sorry to get to the last chapter. Keep up the good work ladies! I'll be waiting for the next one!"
4,Are we really who we think we are?,The better question is...Are we who everyone else thinks we are? I loved the story and I loved the fact even more that each issue was either resolved or alluded that it was on the right path to be resolved. The relationship that Della had with her girls. Celeste giving Niki her blessing to live her life. Della dealing with the demons from her past and Ronnie realizing that it was time to let the truth be known.
3,This one left me disappointed,"I consider myself a big fan of Virginia Deberry and Donna Grant. I read and loved ""Tryin to Sleep in the Bed You Made"". I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy of ""Far From the Tree"" but I wish I had checked this one out from the library. The story moved so slow until I had to force myself to finish. The ending was good and I couldn't wait to find out what was the big secret that (Odella) Della was trying very hard to keep hidden. Celeste was such a control freak until she almost lost her family in the mist of it all. Ronnie was searching for a dream that never came. Niki was the only character that I really cared for. She didn't allow her mother to control her life. I also feel that the book was too thick. With that being said, I wish these ladies the best. And I will support future work. God's Blessing."
4,Unique Reading!!,"Virginia deBerry and Donna Grant have done it again! I thought that this book was captivating and refreshing. Also unique because it was about family relationships instead of male/female relationships exclusively. Some of the plot was difficult to believe though, like if Lester really cared that much, i can't see him not trying to contact Odella at some point over the years. I definitely recommend this book"
2,Cute but Useless,"Okay, this product defintely has the cute factor going for it. But it is hardly useful as a breakfast jug. Really, if you are more than one person, how far is a 22 ounce vessel going to go? The jug holds 20 ounces comfortably, but 22 ounces is pushing close to the top where you will have spill overs.The jug is too large to use as a coffee creamer. So it just seems like a piece that can't find a home.I think it would be a brilliant vase, and that is what I will probably end up using it for, lest I don't want to totally throw away $30 bucks.Bottom line.... even if you are a diehard Le Creuset collector, for thirty bucks, save your money. This piece is really worthless."
5,Perfect for everyday use.,"When I purchased this item, I pictured it to be slightly taller than it was when it arrived, but I soon realized that it was perfectly sized for me. Since it is a breakfast jug, I've used it for serving milk, and juice at the table. I also found it to fit perfectly under my juicer attachment for my KitchenAid stand mixer, so that the fresh juice siphons right into the jug, and its size also allows it to go straight to the table to be served, or into the refrigerator to chill for later use. Because it's so functional, I'm thinking of buying another to keep homemade syrups in, also."
2,Flakiest cable I have ever purchased,"I am a guitarist and have owned many dozens of cables.Every cable has a lifespan, a point when the wear and tear on the plugs is a little too much for the construction, and then you have no choice but to repair the cable (not so difficult, really) or buy a new one.Once I bought a cable and it was having trouble after about a month of use, and I thought, ""this is the worst cable I've ever purchased."" But now it's second to this one, which was having problems within *less than a week*.I'm not giving it 1 star because except for the ends, the cable itself seems quite rugged and high-quality. Maybe I got a lemon? But again, this has never happened to me before, so it's hard to believe."
3,Two Greats and a bunch of Also-Rans,The two really great cuts in this collection make it worth owning. That Acapulco Gold by the Rainy Daze and Let It Out (Let it All Hang Out) by the Hombres are true gems of the era. The rest of this stuff is fairly unremarkable.
4,Current and topical,"We hear a lot about the way kids today behave, and people like to blame television for causing this behavior. I know of the author, Dr. DeMars, as a teacher at Sam Houston State University, so I was interested in what his thoughts were. I believe he has provided a realistic evaluation of the role TV has--along with many other factors--in developing members of society into accepting certain behaviors as appropriate or inappropriate. I don't understand all the research terminology, but Dr. DeMars is able to provide enough current examples that non-scholars such as I am will be able to relate to. I think his observations are insightful."
5,"Undestructible, massive chopping block",It's a pleasure to use this tool! Makes chopping easier and lets you arrange the ingredients right there because of its size.I was rubbing it with oil for 2 weeks and it absorbed about 1 quart of vegetable oil on both sides before it was ready.
5,This is a MUST HAVE for the serious cook/chef!,"Of course the 16"" would have been better but too heavy for me to handle. So, I ordered the 15"" which is 1/2 thinner than this 16"".Unfortunately, I was notified by the Wok Shop that the 15"" was no longer available due to the halt for cutting down this near endangered Lignum Vitae tree. However, they still have the 14"" available and that's what I ordered. It's still strong and heavy in weight and in duty.I highly recommend this Chinese Ironwood Chopping Block. It is a 1 piece cut so it remains strong when doing hard and serious chopping. Don't be confused with the John Boos' chopping block which I don't recommend anything that are put together from small pieces.This is a MUST HAVE for the serious cook and chef and those that do alot of chopping. Don't pass it up before they will no longer be available for sale!The Wok Shop is very nice people to deal with too!!!"
3,Okay and Good,"We really love our block but it has a HUGE crack to almost the middle. I contacted the seller who told me to soak it in water. After doing so, the crack came back. I don't think you can have one without a crack! The problem is that food falls in the giant crack and it's impossible to get out! Anyway, it is nice to have and we use it multiple times every day. Just be prepared to have it crack!"
3,Internet Dating .... ugh,"The book had a lot of good suggestions, but the problem is internet dating has no rules of etiquette. Everyone does their own thing. Consequently there is a lot of misunderstanding."
4,"Smooth and creamy, great value!","I love this stuff. It is pure, great quality and lasts a rather long time, considering the size. It is a great texture and goes on very smoothly. My only complaint is that it doesn't moisturize long term- in other words, every time I wash my hands I have to reapply. But I suppose that is normal and typical of all creams and butters.Nevertheless, I will be ordering it again!Also, the wording on the lid seems a bit home-made and amateur. It claims to help with skin conditions, such as eczema. I have some type of dermatitis on my finger but this cream didn't help at all, and I apply it at least 5 times a day."
2,Meh,I use it on my skin sometimes but I dont understand the raving reviews about it. For me it is too greasy and so I dont put it on my face. Like other natural products you only get the results you want over a long period of time. For me in Trinidad its an expensive buy when you add shipping and convert the cost to TT dollars so just becuz of that I may not buy this again.
1,Not Natural/Artificial Color,"This is not natural, unrefined/unprocessed shea butter. Do your research. Shea butter is never yellow unless coloring is added. It's an off-white/beige color with a smoky smell."
3,kind of cool,this stuff is kind of awesoem in theory but after you really look into real shea butter and research it. you realize that this is not the real thing. Also its kind of waxy to the touch and it feels like theres def additives.
3,Came in a flat baggie...,"Just fyi it says it comes in a plastic container, but mine arrived smashed flat in a baggie. The container would have been nicer to store it in."
4,It really moisturizes and skin and helps with swollen muscles.,"The smell is not that bad at all. I received the product in just a week, and I live in an FPO area. It is not grainy, but the application to the skin takes some time. I usually heat it up in the microwave and use it as my moisturizer. I wash it off the next thing I wake up.I am suffering from an intense muscle spasms, and I can barely walk. I applied some on it, and it relieves pain, momentarily, but is better than nothing.I use it on my hair, too. I live it on when I go to sleep and wash it when I wake up. I usually do this when I plan to wash my hair the next day. The results are good! My hair feels relaxed and soft.For the face and neck, I put a palmful on, and wash it the next day as well. I would use a little amount on the face, if you have oily skin.I would recommend this for people who are usually stressed out, people with dry skin, people that has daily facials via chemical peeling, and for muscle spasms."
4,Real Deal,this is the real natural shea butter. the product was delivered before the date. It was displaced some throughout the container but overall I was pleased with the price and product. I use it with Ambi cream to create the perfect glow
5,Awesome for Natural Hair,"I buy this product all the time in the states, so being deployed, I need my hair lotion...this product was the same as if I'd bought it in the states! VERY PLEASED!"
5,Shea Butter,When I was ordering it was the least expensive for what I needed. Will be needing more in time. Made wonderful Lotion bars for friends for Christmas.
1,"Sorry, but it's all about packaging","I feel bad, but I just had to give one star because what I got did not look like the picture. In the picture it shows the shea butter in almost bar form in plastic containers, so I expected it to come that way. Instead, my shea butter was melted in a plasic zip lock bag,.. so unimpressed. This makes it difficult to use and now I have to find something to scoop the mess into. I can totally understand it being melted as it's middle summer, but the zip-lock? It would've nice to know exactly what I was buying.AN UPDATE: after finding a plastic container to put the shea butter in things went well- from my experience this seems to be good quality shea butter and I recommend the SHEA BUTTER, but I will keep my review on the packaging so other buyers are aware of it."
1,"For those sensitive to smell, this isn't for you","This product absolutely stinks. Many of the reviews refer to the smell as ""not unpleasant"" and ""nutty"". well, let me tell you: it's VERY unpleasant. and it smells more like burning rubber than nuts.The package arrived covered in black sticky goo, as if it had been sitting in some sort of dirty decaying sugary substance. Just nasty. Can't believe they shipped it in this condition, and can't believe Amazon sells this stuff.As for the product within, it did spread around relatively nicely. It's thick, but that's what you want when you order shea butter. That's the only good thing I can say about it. If you use it on your hands, you'll smell this burnt rubber smell for the rest of the day. So awful. I returned it the same day."
1,"Way too yellow, not 100% shea butter","<UPDATED REVIEW>After using this for a few more days after posting my original review, I am updating it because I am now fully convinced that yellow coloring has been added to this as well as other ingredients. It actually leaves a yellow stain on my hands and clothes. This is NOT 100% shea butter. I actually went to an african market near me and showed it to them and they compared it with their real shea butter. It is nothing a like. Do not buy from this seller.<ORIGINAL REVIEW>Im a little suspicious of this product, it smells like shea butter and feels like it too, but dont understand why it is so yellow. I have been to africa and seen raw shea butter and its usually greyish or off white. This is way to bright and yellow as though color has been addded to it. Other than that, its still great for hair and skin but I dont think I will buy from this seller again."
3,Couldn't get past the smell.,"I apparently have an extremely sensitive nose or something, because I couldn't even use this product due to the smell. I tried putting in on my legs and feet, thinking it would be far enough away from my nose, but it kept making me gag. NO way was I going to put this on my face like I had intended when I bought it. I've used other items with shea butter in them before and actually thought they smelled nice, but I could not stomach this one. I gave it to my friend because I just did not want the smelly thing in my house. I still gave it three stars because I'm sure it would work fine if I could actually use it."
5,Great!,"I bought this because of an episode of Dr. Oz, my husband has had many skin issues due to his Type #2 diabetes, figured maybe this would work. Well it has been very helpful keeping his issues at bay and soothing. I too use it for my dry cracked heels and it works great!"
3,Just ok!,This Shea butter is ok..nothing special..about the same as what I can get im my area. I would not be purching this shea butter again. The shippment was very quick.
1,Not edible,"Do NOT use this product to make buttercream frosting. The color, scent, texture...everything was off and I even felt a little sick after the party. I'll just sick with regular cow butter next time. I think I may be allergic to shea."
5,Love this stuff,Great product and packaged well. I've received other butters but none that were packaged quite as clean as this one.Love this stuff and will purchase more. Larger quantities
5,Good Value,"I am happy with this product. You pay 3x this price for the same amount (or less!) of shea butter at most bath and body stores. This stuff works great, has a mild pleasant scent, and is a great price."
3,"Good Shea Butter, Container Not Filled Completely","This is already a small container, and the order I received was filled only half way. For my needs, it lasted a short time. Due to this, I prefer the larger size offered by the same vendor. The quality of the shea butter is high. It's smooth and buttery with a nice smokey scent. I use this on my hair, skin, face, and lips. Love it!"
2,Disappointed with product but loved customer service at Nature and Herbs,"I wasn't sure how I would like the product after reading the reviews thought I'd try it. I was disappointed it was to waxy for me. But, I'm writing this review because Nature and Herbs the company I brought the African Shea Butter from was wonderful. They responded quickly and professionally and I look forward to ordering (not the same item) in the future."
5,Pure gold...,"I received it almost immediately, I was going to mix it with some other butters and oils to save my pregnant, itchy belly from further stretch marks. But first I tried it the way it is, and it felt so good on my skin, that I decided not to mix it with anything else. Someone mentioned the smell, and it actually not so bad. To me it smells nutty and chocolaty, it reminds me of a Hershey almond bar for some reason. But if the smell really bothers you, you can emulsify it with rose water or orange blossom water, using the stick blender and that transfer it to the lotion dispenser - makes it easy to use."
3,Delivery to Europe,"Colour varies significantly from that on sites such as the UK based website for ""Total Shea Butter"" a butter which I have bought and found a fantastic moisterizer for both hair and body; while ""Total Shea Butter"" give prompt delivery being a local UK based company, I'm still interested to know if the varying colour ofAfrican Shea Butter Cream 100% Pure & Raw (Gold) 5 oz.gives different benefits in comparison. Any comments from other users will be greatly received."
4,Dry skin? Here's your solution!,"When used in combination with black soap, you will see your skin go from dull to radiant. I don't particularly like the smell so I add a few drops of scented oil to my hands before applying. Shea butter has also been great on my natural hair as well."
2,Not RAW,"I purchased this product because I could not get to my local store for raw shea butter. This product came quickly, but it was not raw. it appears as if they melted raw shea butter and poured it into a container. Raw shea butter is lumpy. When you rub it, it gets creamy and spreads evenly. This product is flaky and falls into pieces. Dont get me wrong, it is real shea butter. But it is NOT RAW shea butter."
3,Real Shea Butter,I like this product. It takes a minute to warm up but as soon as it does it go onto your skin and in it.it feels great and relieves the dry cracked feeling. A little goes a long way. I think you can mix it withyour body lotion and get more out of it.
2,Difficult to use - slow to absorb.,"This is not a cream, it is like a very dry, solid wax. It does not readily absorb into skin (takes at least an hour). The price is low but the usability is low too."
5,great,I bought this to make some lotion bars. I used all but about an ounce and they turned out great. I am now using the remainder as moisturizer. It will probably last me the rest of my life.
2,African Shea Butter not as I expected,I was a little surprised because Ive been using pure shea butter for a while now and this one was very different. It's very grain like and perhaps doesnt work on my hair as does the shea butter Ive used in the past. I am not sure if I would buy this again. Nonetheless it may work for others.
3,Ehhhh... not sold,"I am a shea butter newbie, and I thought I could handle this but it just isnt my thing! Going to stick to the pre-made raw lotions.This comes in little blocks that are difficult to spread, so I followed some directions online using oil etc and tried to turn it into lotion. Boy, was that a bad idea. I am no good at making shea butter lotion so FAIL for me!Also, I am not a huge fan of the smell. It isn't THAT overpowering but again, I think I discovered that this just isn't really my thing. So even if this is the more potent option, I think I am going to just stick to my lotions. Less of a hassle."
5,Fantastic Product,"This is a great product, it clarifies the skin and helps to fade dark spots. Will definitely purchase again, highly recommend it"
4,Shea butter cream?,"Good shea butter. Only thing is, it is not cream, Broken up chunks of shea butter. Really no difference to me. Will be soaping with it over the weekend. Good price."
1,Not real Shea Butter,"I was born and raised in Ghana. I have personally with my own hands picked Karite Fruit from a shea tree and ground it into butter. I have never seen Shea butter in a yellowish gold color until I came into the United States. Shea butter is usually an off white, beige color. The texture is smooth and should melt directly if rubbed in your fingertips. This stuff has more of the texture of coco butter with yellow food coloring. The best Shea Butter I have found since I cant get it shipped from home is on CoastalScents.com. Its the closest thing to what I remember from home."
3,Geat Moisturizing...But No Healing,"Shea butter is well known for it's moisturizing, and more notably, healing properties. Shea butter, in it's natural form, is off-white, pale yellow, or cream colored after processing. It has a unique nutty smell which is not offensive. The smell will degrade over time after application...unless too much has been applied. Golden Shea Butter has palm oil added to it. Also, the healing component(s) of shea butter is quite sensitive. It deteriorates over a short period time or if the final product is altered too much.I've used this product for a year. While a great natural moisturizer, I did not observe any signs of healing. I have a feeling that this shea butter is older or has been altered to the degree of degradation.Once again, *this* shea butter with palm oil seems to be a great natural moisturizer (better than any chemicals in a bottle you might find at a local store), but don't expect any healing of blemishes, scars, etc."
1,african shea butter,I didnt like this because my order came in destroyed. i didnt basically get my shea butter so it was a waste of my money.
1,To greasy and doesn't work!!! (GUY REVIEW),Shipping was FAST but it's super hard and has to warmed up in micro for 15seconds to be able to use it but I got this for 2 stretch marks that I have recently noticed behind my legs and used this product twice a day for 1month and saw no results at all so I threw this junk to garbage where it belongs!
1,aweful crumbly texture,"This is not a cream! I've never seen shea butter like this - when I opened the container the shea butter was dried out and crumbly, not a smooth cream/paste like other shea butters. Because I was in a time crunch I had to use it to make my holiday gifts (lotion), but the final texture of the lotion was also crumbly not smooth due to the low quality shea butter. The lotion moisturizes very well (though I do not know if that is due to the shea or the other oil I added to the lotion), but the texture is awful and I will never use this product again. Spend a little more money for a better product, this one is not worth a penny."
4,Beautifully hypnotic,"The Invisible Man is undoubtedly one of Mark Eitzel's finest albums, with or without American Music Club. Very few artists can mine the inner soul quite as well as Eitzel with such staggeringly consistent results. I don't want to go on about how some music is more real than other music - however, when you listen to this record you don't feel shortchanged for quality and artistic integrity. 'Can You See', 'Shine', 'To the Sea' and 'Sleep' are all utterly spellbinding, ingeniously arranged and lyrically fascinating. Take the time to discover The Invisible Man, it'll be an *illuminating* experience."
5,Great book!,"I found this a helpful, clear guide to self hypnosis. After reading it and following the instructions in the exercises I was able to enter hypnosis and make positive changes. The tape was helpful too. I heartily recommend this to anyone who is interested in experiencing self hypnosis for themselves."
2,"ok,.....but,.....not really impressed,...","Hi,...Maybe its me,..but I was not as happy with this as I thought that I'd be,...I will keep trying to listen to the CD,...& read the book,...though,.just in case,.I haven't given it as fair of a reviewas I should have,...,...LH"
3,An oddly mixed bag,"1. O'Neil should know this character, and the DCU, a lot better than he seems to. Instead, he intentionally veers wildly off from DCU continuity -- not little fanboy stickling, but major pieces of the character and the world vary significantly from the ""canon."" Why?2. The best part of the book, as noted elsewhere, is the beginning, where Kyle is learning how to actually use the ring.3. The weakest part (aside from #1) is the endless Cosmic Stuff -- which, as also noted, takes up much of the book and works far less well in print than it might have with pictures. Or maybe not.4. Kyle's characterization is solid and entertaining. Everyone else (in the JLA, the Oans, Hal Jordan, etc.) are cardboard cut-outs.Not a bad book. Just, disappointingly, not a good one."
2,An OK read till the middle...,"It starts out very well by going into the action and it is well written until you get to the center of the novel. At that time I felt that I needed a college degree to get thru the rest of it. The book goes into a metaphysical, scientifical, and all other ifical reasons and explanations for the origin of heroes.Not what I thought when I saw it. i read one other Justice League novel and it was almost the same way. This has turned me off to this type of novel.Use your money to go and get a comic book, it is better in my opinion.Welty69"
4,a heros quest indeed,"I give this book 4 of 5 because I read it in under 2 days...so that means i was hooked. the beginning was a little shaky, its written from Kyle's point of view. like a memoir or a biography. very strange and it takes some time getting used too. but the plot and characters are strong and well as the setting and the overall theme. i would have preferred that the book be about the bestest green lantern: Hal Jordan, alas it was about Kyle Raynor and its rocky beginning as the new Green Lantern. but, its still good. if the book actually follows the real beginning of Kyle Raynor... I have no idea. I never read his comics. but like I said, I was hooked and loved the fact that I got to see the beginning of Kyle's career. That's also why I loved Helltown, that's about the beginning of The Question. also very cool!"
1,Wow was this bad.,"Ask anyone who knows me - I'm a GL fan. Especially of Kyle. What Dennis O'Neil did to this book almost makes me re-think that. O'Neil decided to, for no particular reason, and not done very well, was completely re-write the origin story for Kyle. The only thing that remained was the bar. Alex is gone. Major Force is gone. Hal is gone. Ganthet is there too much! It's as if O'Neil had a story in mind for the re-vamping of GL all those years ago and this was his version and he wanted everyone to read it. Guess what? Its bad. You don't feel anything for Kyle. In fact, you could care less about him or anyone around him for that matter.I had high hopes for this book and I couldn't have been more dissapointed."
1,why was it wriiten,"This book was so meaningless that the author did not bear in mindaction,adventure etc. There is nothing in this book that I like.I respect the author a great deal, but he blew it with this book.I hope that the next book of his I get ""Batman Begins"" does not disappoint as much as the Green Lantern story did."
1,What the heck were they thinking???,"Ok. Kyle was the GL in the DC Comic book world for a long time. He took over for Hal Jordan who decided to take a long needed vacation (ok, he went crazy and killed a whole bunch of people but hey, my version sounds more real then what this novel did).This novel in one word sucked. It bastardized the entire origin of Kyle Rayner and how he became a Green Lantern. It destroyed what happened to Coast City and how it tied into Superman. It made the Atom seem like a pain in the tucas and the only character that was written correcly was Batman.Hal is in this but not in a good way. Kyle is in this and it too is not in a good way. When did Kyle ever call Ganthet ""Gandy""? And why in the heck did the other Oan's want to remake the universe...wasn't that Hal's job when he became Parallax???In a nut shell if you like Green Lanter, any version of the character, read the comics and put this book down. There are much better novels out there to read."
3,"green lantern, heroes quest","n. ot great, lots of dialogue. kinda goofy. didnt like guardians treated mlike clueless gods."
1,A waste of paper and binding,"Having very little familiarity with the Green Lantern arcs, I was still familiar enough to feel that this story was a complete travesty. I spent most of the book trying to follow the convoluted storyline. I borrowed this and several other Justice League novels from a friend and, with the exception of this one, I rather enjoyed them. I did not enjoy this one at all and am very glad I did not spend any money on it."
2,lame,"do you really want to read a book that has Superman say ""Go ahead, lovers of evil,""??? because I don't, but I did...regretfully. I know that writers are allowed to write poorly, so this isn't an attack at O'Neil, he just seemed uncomfortable writing about the character. So, bottom line, the story is really bad, the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the last paragraph is one of the best paragraphs I'd ever read"
4,Another entry for a fine tribute to Louis Kaufman,"This is the same asStill, Bloch and Porter. See my detailed review thereunder."
2,For beginners only; Experts AVOID THIS ONE!,"WoW! How can somebody gather up secondary sources and call this a book is beyond me! All it is is a listing of the websites where they sell products to you and the sites or stores features. Well gee I can do all that myself with sites like MySimon.com or heck, even Amazon.com whre you can easily compare the lowest prices.The only somewhat useful information I found is the ""What to do if your product didn't arrive,"" your rights, policies, safety etc, but nothing that I already didn't know.So if you are a beginner and know nothing about shopping and how to compare prices, this book is great! If you are an expert, this will be your new doorstop after a day's reading."
5,great voices and great songs,forget those wack remixes the originals are far better and more soulful.these sisters were really solid vocalists.nile rodgers&bernard edwards gave the sisters there anthem we are family.thank you for the full length version.hes the greatest dancer is another jam produced by the genius team of rodgers&edwards.a true soulful cd.
1,Bewarned & beware!,"Yes, something's going down here and I'm not impressed. The reviews inserted onto this page could not refer to this particular download release as they were composed years ago for the audio ""Best of"" which actually has a different tracklisting to this issue. Yes, I've previewed each track on the d/load compile and they are mostly, if not all, live....yet no mention of this on cover artwork or in Amazon page notes.This can only be either an absolute bad botch up or someone at Amazon feels at ease misleading the public. It's one thing to be successful at providing a service to music lovers...it's another to milk it. A disgrace! I'll be keeping a close eye on this shambles.Anyway...the cover artwork is a dead giveaway."
5,Japanese Picture Dictionary,"This book is a necessity for any student of the Japanese language. Hundreds of words each have their own illustrations and most pages have large, beautiful composite drawings great for point 'n' mane practice. The subjects are very diverse and include ""The Make-Believe Castle"", ""The Attic"", and ""The Mouse Hunt"", which list some unusual and fun words. I might just need to say 'fairy princess' while in Japan, or reading manga. The book uses English, romanjij (Japanese words in the Roman alphabet), as well as kana and kanji (Japanese characters) so readers of any skill level can read and use the book. As a beginning student of the language, I found the multiple alphabet format used for each word very helpful. I enjoyed reading and learning from this book very much and I recommend it as an addition to any language student's or child's library."
3,Not what I expected.,"This is actually a very well written and illustrated book. The problem is that I am a beginner. This book has hiragana, katakana, and kanji all mixed on the same pages. I am not quite ready for kanji. If you are, the book is perfect. For the true beginner, you may wish to hold off on this book until you learn hiragana and katakana in complete detail!"
4,Childhood memories <3,"My dictionary arrived yesterday. It is the exact same pictionary from back when I was learning Spanish XD It is EXACTLY the same. Same pictures and everything. The ONLY difference is everything's in Japanese instead of Spanish. But it is the EXACT same thing except that part. XD XDBrings back memories. <3 However, Although it wins points memory wise. A lot of the vocab, you don't need. Like who's wears a ""Top Hat"" anymore? I remember another comment about a man having a Japanese wife who says,""They have words that people don't even use anymore."" That is true. I don't think you are going to need ""movie projector"" or ""spinning wheel."" However, the visual aid is very helpful. But the artist is very lazy. I remember the same pictures from my childhood with the Spanish dictionary. What I mean is, they aren't even Japanese scenes. These are American scenes with Japanese words under them. It would be nicer if they were Japanese pictures instead of American pictures."
3,Good for the Visual Learner,"This purchase was for me and my daughter to learn some basic Japanese words. Although I'm happy to have this book, it does not help in pronunciation. Also, some of the pages are so visually busy, it is hard to keep focus.Overall, this will do the trick - to pick up a few words and start the process of being exposed to another language. Also, since my 2 1/2 year old cannot read words, it is a way to associate the visual with the spoken word.Yes, I know the book says 5 and up, but everyone learns at their own pace. I did not expect the book to teach either of us how to speak Japanese. But, it does allow for fun/learning time without a computer/TV screen."
5,The magnificent four !,"I've known their hits before I get this cd set, but now I love the music of The Manhattan Transfer more than ever. They perform a vast variety of all-time hits- ""evergreens"", more different kinds of their own hits and you never stop wondering of their musical sense, the high quality of each song and also that so many years they are on the stage- almost 30 ! When they visited Moscow in 1997 I was amased by live concert. That was really great performance! I try to vish all members of The Manhattan Transfer to make such great hits untill eternity! Sergei from Moscow. P.S. Buy this CD-set, IT'S GREAT, TOO !!!"
4,It's really nice,"Yeah this is kinda un-Orbital but it's not such a bad thing. The score that they make is creepy and it wouldn't be something you would listen to everyday ( unless you're seriously unstable ) but as a soundtrack it sounds thoroughly listenable and cohesive and not just something random thrown together. They make a good go at it and is worth the effort. It's also got this creepy ambience to it which is almost beautiful. Occasionally it gets into really noisy industrial territory so perhaps you'd have to be a big fan of that particular genre to enjoy this music. However this wouldn't be the best place to start if people are looking to get into Orbital. Look elsewhere if you are a beginner, this is only for the hardened Orbital fan ( and even then people are divided on this )."
3,octane review,"i'ts hard to judge this soundtrack cos it's not what youd like to hear from orbital. think of it as orbital does classical! buy in-sides instead,the best electronic album ever made."
2,Do NOT Import for $35,"This one is pretty much the epitome of mediocrity as far as sound tracks are concerned as it is just that, a soundtrack and little more. It definitely has a movie feel, and only a movie feel. I wish I could say I have seen the movie that this goes with, but that seemes even harder to obtain than this CD.There are maybe two tracks I would consider listenable if you aren't in the mood for pure movie ambience. Those being Moment of Crisis and Initiation.Even if you are a die hard Orbital fan such as myself I would not pay the premimium price to get my hands on this. I'd try Ebay first. It might turn out to be much cheaper that way....If you are looking for good Orbital for listening, look elsewhere."
2,This is just so... NOT orbital.,"When i first heard this, i had to double and triple check whether it was the real Orbital or not. It is. And I don't like it. It's kinda nice for something calm to listen to, but SO not worth $35. Look towards In-Sides for GOOD orbital."
3,"Cheaply made, but they get the job done.","I bought these socks for a costume, and they definitely worked: nice and warm, bright colors. The only problem is they run small, and they are quite long, so the tops of them ended up cutting off the circulation to my knee after a few hours. One time I fell asleep in them, and it genuinely hurt taking them off. Don't do that."
2,basic freestyle swimming technique,"I feeled being cheated when I bought this dvd and another dvd from thesame coache: basic backstrokes swimming technique for these reasons:1. More than half of the 2 dvds are exactly the same things, just a duplicate scenes.2. No underwater camera, can not see the body movements clear.3. A lot of talks that are not useful for learning.4. The prices are too high compared with other sellers.5. More like this dvd aim at teenagers, not for adults"
1,Not even worth 2 stars,"Together, this video and the backstroke one are a total rip-off. Like the other reviewer said, much of the two are exactly the same. They show freestyle swimming on the backstroke DVD and vice versa. The bulk of the instruction is on different drills to do, almost all focusing on hip rotation, with a minuscule amount about kicking. Neither one says anything about arm movement, and you can't get a good idea of what the arm movement is supposed to be from the video. The DVD quality is bad -- it looks like it was converted from an old video tape. I didn't buy this video, just borrowed it from the library, and even for that I could not recommend wasting your time on it."
5,About this tape,"Basic Freestyle Swimming Technique features a progressive system of skills and drills that is focused on perfecting the basic elements of successful and efficient swimming. The program details a systematic process for developing the crawl stroke ""from the inside out."" The fundamentals and techniques involved in efficiently performing the freestyle stroke are also explained and shown.Topics covered: streamlining and body position; balance and rotation; flutter kick and underwater travel; arm stroke and anchoring; rhythm and timing; developmental drills; putting it all together."
5,Pretty great,"Just go this in the mail. I was a little weary of it upon ordering because of the low price, but it seems well-constructed and is every bit as big as I wanted it. In fact, it's actually bigger than I anticipated. I expect that filling it to capacity with gear would make it heavier than the fabric could withstand, but also heavier than would be practical. Not a big deal, but if you order this, expect a really, really big bag. The dimensions listed don't quite do it justice.When I put everything in it, I realized the one shortcoming of this thing: because the bag is constructed long-ways, the stuff inside can shift quite a bit when it's upright. I plan to fix this with a bungie cord or two around the contents inside the bag. Not really a problem.Overall, this is is probably going to solve a lot of problems for me and alleviate a lot of back pain. At around $110, it's a good deal."
3,"Good, but suffers from unnecessary complexity.","I thought the first three chapters did an excellent job of covering advances in knowledge representation. However chapter four is marred by an attempt to present what appears to be virtually every syntax used relating to processes. Somewhere in this gulf of complexity I think he has some basic concepts, but they are hard to reach. It's equivalent to reading a book on algorithms in which the author presents the algorithms in C, Cobol, Fortran, Basic, SAS, etc. Why not just present the concepts within the context of a MINIMUM of syntax? Still the book is worth reading and has good appendixes."
5,A Unique Contribution,"In this book, John Sowa conveys diverse and effective insights within the field of knowledge representation (KR). The frameworks he employs are deeply grounded philosphically. (Sowa's previous work on conceptual structures reactivated and extended the innovative work of Charles Sanders Peirce, which integrates logic and graph theory.) The work reviewed here surveys a wide range of KR issues from basic ontology to agency and processes. Chapter 6, Knowledge Soup, is widely recognized for framing and addressing some of the more demanding, and largely unresolved, challenges in the field.Throughout the book, issues are explored in a coherent, readable way. Of course, KR implies the use of relevant formalisms, and readers with some background in AI research will be better prepared to absorb the book's insights. However, for students and scholars looking for an integrated overview, Sowa makes a unique contribution."
1,you gotta be kidding,"Oh my God! I have a headache. I could not make heads or tails of this book. I know it's written in an older English but I thought I might still get something out of it. No dice. If you're an english language professor you might plow through it and get something for your efforts but for the average well read individual like me, I think not. Save your money and pass on this one."
2,Didn't last,Looks cool but lasted for only 6 months of moderate non gigging use. I couldn't tell any difference on sound. I haven't contacted Hosa and don't intend to as this was a $15 cable.
5,Guitar Cord,Excellent guitar cord with no static background heard while using or moving about. Awesome product and reasonable price. Would recommend product.
4,very nice cables,"bought several for home studio. they are nicely assembled and are sturdy and hold up well to being stepped on. They are not inexpensive--- I think there is likely a good bit of markup for the cloth covering. But, for what they are, if it lasts, it will be worth it. Well-built, if not a bit pricey.M"
4,A very good book with awesome characterization,"This is a story of a smart alek Cobra pilot who is fighting to survive in the air and survive his superior officers with his wise comments. This book will make you bite your nails at one point and rolling over laughing at others, With his heart stopping rescue missions to his shurades trying to make his song be bunk better. I would definetly recomend this book to others and I enjoyed it even though it was a summer reading book for me in high school is one of my favorite books."
5,FANTASTIC!! I could not put it down!,"Apache Sunrise is the best personal account that I have read on Vietnam helicopter aviation. This book combines descriptions of the hard hitting and gutsy combat with the human side of Mr. Boyle's Vietnam Tour. Not only full of facts about tactics and operations, he describes the little things you do not get in most history books! I felt like I was sitting listening to him tell his story in person. His description of his buddies and fellow pilots made them your friends too. Great job Mr. Boyle."
3,Good short segments without much detail,"Explaining globalization is a simple collection of interviews and pseudo- debates about globalization. It is well made, however, don't expect too much. The interviewees are very insightful and they do make strong points, but there isn't enough time to really ""explain"" anything. For example, Hernando De Soto's interview does not even begin to scratch the surface on the issue of property rights in developing and former communist countries, which he considers crucial for their economic development. One gets a better picture by reading his book, ""The Mystery of Capital,"" without out spending as much money."
2,Disappointing,"Four segments--none recent and some as old as ten years. If I had to do it again, I wouldn't buy this one."
4,What we've been waiting for,Just what I and my student colleagues were looking for. I'm going to use the case studies in my next teaching practice. It's the ideal balance between theory and classroom reality.
5,thats just what i needed!,"My old guitar cord broke, and this was just what i needed for a cheap price! high quality and its 10 feet long longer than my old one. The plugs are nice too."
4,"flexible, soft rubber is great.",Cheap and good texture rubber that does not get stiff. Only time will tell how well the soldering is. Sounds fine to me.
5,heavily insulated and sturdy jacks,A 10 foot cable to connect the electric guitar and amp. As it's sturdy and reasonably priced I think it rates well.
4,"If you want it, you've got it!","This is a high quality compilation for those who really dig this genre of music. Personally, I bought the CD just for the two gorgeous songs ""San Francisco"" and ""Love is All Around."" Either one of those would be worth the price of the CD, but there are lots of classics included. A few of the tracks don't seem to stand the test of time particularly well, but may be worthwhile to those who have an historical interest."
3,Psychedelia and the Summer of Love,"There are songs on this CD which will take you right back to the days of Flower Power, peace signs, Love In's and chemical alteration (smile). I was disappointed in a few of the tunes included - not what I would call TOP 40 at all - obsure ones. There were though, enough to get me to purchase it. I simply burned it to my computer, and deleted the few that just didn't reach me. So - if you have a hankering for remembering these days (which I will always have - and not the chemical alteration phase - just the memories of living for something larger than yourself)... buy it."
2,50/50,"This is only a so-so compilation. It does contain a few real, original tracks. But it also has some lame remakes and some songs that were never on the charts in 1967, or any other time. Those who can remember 1967 will find this unsatisfactory."
5,A most Anglo-saxon product!,"If you, like me, are the kind of person who are proud of their Anglo-Saxon heritage and like to wear the clothing indicative of our people, while at the same time enjoying a lovely, comfy and overall beautifully crafted cap, suited for wearing the whole year around, at least in civilized climes, then this product will most definately satisfy you, as it has done for me."
4,Expensive. Superb quality.,I guess you get what you pay for. It was a gift but still a hat... I can see that he has no idea how pricey it was!
1,this is a children's book???????????????,"Basically this book is about a man (Willie) who takes the boots off a dead man who he finds in the woods. Since it is so cold outside, the legs of the dead man snap off when Willie steals the boots and the feet are still inside the boots. Then Willie feeds the feet of the dead man to a cow. Come on parents, wake up!! Is this book really appropriate for children? NO, no it is not."
3,Feet or no feet?,"Cold feet did have a lesson to be learned, and had a surprising ending to it , although the book just kind of ended.Their was no suspense build up to the end , it was just a quick shock and ending.I think the illustrations should of shown in a funny way the corspe trying to catch up with the piper."
4,Come on ... this is good stuff..,"I understand paranoid parenting... but this is a great story, well told, funny and entertaining.. My 6 year old twins loved it... We read tons of books together and little bunny fu fu books just don't cut it. The world is not politically correct, nor should the world pretend otherwise. For the record, he did not dismember the body, the feet broke off.. well sort of.. Some on people, give your kids some credit for understanding life.. Take the opportunity to teach about the setting, the time period, and how some people need make difficult decisions in order to survive.. Or just go back to Little Bunny Fu Fu, I'm sure they will relate better."
1,Even 3rd graders may not be ready??,"This scared the wits out of my son after it was read to him in the school library. I am sure it's a wonderfully scary book for the older crowd, but if my 8 year old is scared, maybe it shouldn't be marketed to third graders unless it comes with a nightlight."
2,Too weird for my five year old,"My son excels as a reader and checked this out on one of his preschool trips to the library. It is definitely for older kids, maybe seven or eight. He didn't understand the plot very well and trying to explain it to him proved to be... interesting. I would suggest steering clear of this if your child is 5 or younger."
1,Not for children - about dismembring a dead body - 0 stars!!,"A morbid book apparently based on an old British folk story about a homeless bagpiper that finds a dead man in the woods and decides to take his boots. Since they won't come off easily he breaks them off, legs and all, and takes the severed limbs with him. When a farmer refuses to let him stay in his house and sends him to the barn, the piper decides to play a joke on him, thaw the feet out and give them to the cow to munch on. The farmer flees in horror. This is a downright creepy and scary book that is not appropriate for children ages 5-8 at all. I'll be throwing my copy in the trash rather than donating it and risk having an innocent child pick it up. Would give it zero stars if I could!"
4,Great toy,My 4 year old son loves this toy! Plays with it in the bath every chance he gets. He has other sharks and they all swim together ;)
2,tiny...,small but my son loves it.. however its so small that he lost it... the length is as described however the girth it so thin...
1,Useless - BUY SOMETHING ELSE!,"I bought iWork for one reason and one reason alone: so that I could read my vast number of appleworks 6 documents. Too bad Pages crashes trying to import about 50% of them. And no, there's nothing special about these documents, they're just text files. Apple has also not put out a bug fix update for this software in months, suggesting they're giving up on it. If you're looking for a word processor, there are a number of better options without having to resort to Microsoft products. I strongly recommend against purchasing this product."
2,No Spreadsheet?!,"Give me a break. I can ""work"" with this application about as well as I can fly on a bicycle. When they have a spreadsheet this may be the real deal. Until then, positive reviews are really the cheerleading of biased MAC evangelicals. That said, the potential with OS X is huge if Apple can deliver the software with hard-core productivity apps."
2,Pages is a weak word Processor!,"I'm a teacher and I use these kind of applications all the time, so when Apple released iWorks I was bought it and was greatly disapointed with ""Pages."" This program is great if your just using it for the ready-made templates, but for straight up word processing power, it sorely lacks. The functions you use the most are missing from the main window (where you need them the most) It felt like a ""Micky Mouse-ish"" wannabe of ""Word"" If you want it just for the Templates then get it, but if your serious about word processing then avoid this program, it's got nothin on Microsoft Office 2004 (even AppleWorks is better for simple word processing)The only good thing about iWorks is Keynotes, this program outdoes PowerPoint."
1,pissed off,"bought the program in good faith,cannot use the program because it will not accept the serial number that came with it. contacted apple and was given wrong info to correct the problem. still not able able to do the work i got it for ...please help :("
2,Great program if Microsoft can develop an imitation,"Keynote and Pages, the two applications included in iWork, were flawless under the Panther operating system. The Keynote app has always suffered from its inability to share with PC users. Oh yeah, I know I can convert a Keynote file to Powerpoint, .swf, QuickTime, or PDF, but the problem is that, especially when converting to PowerPoint, Keynote loses all its buttery-rich goodness. It's a PowerPoint problem, I realize, but without a Keynote viewer, there's no way around it. Thus, Mac folks must rely on Microsoft for slide presentations if they don't want to lug around their Mac laptop.Also, installing Tiger will mess up the purchased Keynote templates you have saved. Even reinstalling them won't help.My humble advice is to wait a couple of years until Apple fixes the bugs in Tiger, then MAYBE think about using a Mac. Until then, I'm switching back from a Mac to a PC."
4,No Microsoft Office replacement.,"What iWorks does great is what Apple does great, it goes to the hard to do things and attacks them with avengance. Everyone can type a work processing document, but what about create a great looking resume, a great promotional flyer for a club, or even stellar presentations? iWorks adds a visual flare to the world of presentations, but it lacks in one major area: a decent word processor. While Pages does an awsome job at creating art, when it comes down to putting a paper together it's odd and cumbersome to operate.In the end I recomend this application if you want help creating advertisements, flyers, and presentations like how iMovie helped you with making movies."
2,Pages Not Quite Publisher,"I bought iWork largely for Pages, which promised to be a good layout tool, and, I hoped, a Microsoft Publisher-like program. (Now, I am a Mac switcher, and not having a consumer-level layout program available for OSX is really a bummer.) It's fine if you like preset layouts and have a deep digital photo collection, but it is difficult to create your own layouts and work with them. I'll wait for Pages 2.0."
2,Pages is a disappointment,"I had high hopes for Pages, Apple's new Word Processing Application, but these hopes were shattered once I tried to design a newsletter with it.I find the interface unintuitive, unlike most Apple software, and the templates are not easily customizable. What's more, the application continues to mysteriously ""erase"" work that I have done, even after I have saved it.Apple, I know you can do better than this..."
2,big & pretty--pretty inaccurate,"Nice coffee table book, but a great deal of Mails' stuff is either made-up or borrowed from squirrely popular romanticizations of Cherokee folks. For a general if ideologically out-dated history, see Grace Steele Woodward, for culture see Mooney, Theda Perdue for work specifically on women, and for straight-up historical scholarship, try William McLoughlin's stuff."
5,Important American Musical Event,"I first heard ""Wings"" when it came out in 1970 while I was studying at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. It influenced me strongly, as it broadened the concept of what large pop/jazz ensemble writing could accomplish. I was greatly impressed with Bill Medley's contribution.This is an important addition to American music, and the influence of the Vietnam war on the piece has current implications. In a perfect world it would be picked up by a major and re-released with full distribution."
1,You do not get what is pictured.,Ordered the seat and all that came was the cushions. I am trying to return it and it said restocking fee of 25%. I going to call amazon. this is bogus.
3,interesting but not definitive,"the author has attempted to prove definitively that Jesus was (and presumably still is) the Messiah. While he tries to write from a historian's perspective in the beginning, and presents much interesting information, his argument ultimately falls into the typical pattern of an apologetic. I found his chapter attempting to quantify the statistical odds of predicting certain events in the life and death of Jesus unconvincing as he assumed absolute historical accuracy of the Gospels. At the very least, that is highly debatable. The author also devotes a whole chapter to the inscriptions of early tombs in Jerusalem, some of which are Christian. That doesn't contribute to the argument. The book is very readable, unlike some other theological material."
3,"Not bad, not great","This is a pretty decent CD, not really a bad song on it, but also not any songs that knock your socks off either. Just a good solid album"
3,It Goes Waap!!!,"Any comp with the fabulous Higsons on it is worth the price of admission! Impossible to find their import vinyl and rarely are they mentioned anywhere, anytime. But they were a fun bunch that I had the pleasure of seeing at a club in Queens, NY around 83-84. Buy it for them & then search their stuff on Amazon. Especially their (semi) hit ""Run You Down""."
2,War Live,Always been a big War fan. However this album was a disappointment. Didn't realize it was recorded back in the 70's. Just didn't get anywhere near the studio grooves. I realize it's a live album but it still doesn't do justice to any of the material you're used to hearing.
4,Absolute Classic !!!,"Having been familiar with War from some of their commercial hits(Lowrider,etc.), I was curious when I came across this album on vinyl at a used record shop about ten years ago. Being a lover of live music I bought the album and hastily went home and dropped it on my turntable. This one of the most powerfully played live sets ever made. ""Cisco Kid"" and ""Slipping Into Darkness"" give listeners a dose of thick basslines and excellent instrumentation, purely high intensity funk/rock at its best. These two songs both exceed ten minutes in length and are worth the price of purchasing the CD alone. That being said, the shorter songs can't quite measure up, but they make for good listening none the less(check out ""All Day Music""). The decade of the 70's brought us some great live albums by artists like Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin, and B.B. King. This album easily ranks among them."
4,"GOOD ALBUM, BUT RIP-OFF FORMAT","I hate it when greedy record companies do this:The total track time of both discs runs under 78 minutes. So, this album could have been consolidated onto one disc, with no editing, and released at a one-disc price."
4,Average,"Been using the cable for about 3 weeks now, it's already all full of kinks and twists. Seems to happen to all of them. Otherwise seems very good, end clips work nice and the cable crimps seem very secure."
1,BREAKS EASILY BY A 13.5 LB DOG!!,"This is the second dog tie out cable I have purchased in 2 months. My dog is 13.5 lbs; he chased after another dog and the cable broke at the end where it attaches to the dog. The cable pulled out of it's anchor. It is obviously a poor quality item when it is made for a dog up to 50 lbs, and my 13.5 lb dog broke it after just 6 weeks!!"
5,Good deal.,"Not much to go wrong with this product, but it was the cheapest at the time and I just want to say it's not a scam."
1,this is not good at all,"this is kiddy rock.It is for little kids.And who wants that?well if you have a lil kid they might like this but little kids might not even like this horrible album.I suggest u let them lil kids llistein to old school classic rock like the cult,AC/DC/ or aerosmith instead of the garbage on this album.so one word of advice:DONT BUY THIS ALBUM.it is horrible!!!"
1,Yuck,"Did not like it. I guess I am sensitive to artifical sweetners because that's all I could taste in this product. Would not buy again, and as a result have become more diligent in label reading before buying!"
4,ONE OF THE BETTER TASTING MEAL REPLACEMENTS,"PEOPLE BRAG AND BOAST ABOUT THE TASTE OF LABRADA MEAL REPLACEMENT PROTEIN. WELL, FOR GOOD REASON. I TEND TO FAVOR VANILLA, AND THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT DISAPPOINT. WHEY ISOLATE IS LISTED FIRST IN THE PROTEIN PROFILE, BUT THIS SHAKE IS NEITHER TOO WATERY OR TOO THICK. 12 GRAMS OF CARBS IS A GOOD AMOUNT FOR A LOW CARB SHAKE, AND THE 4 GRAMS OF FIBER WILL HELP TO KEEP YOUR TUMMY SATISFIED. LABRADA IS ONE OF THE MOST TRUSTED AND RESPECTED COMPANIES IN THE SUPPLEMENT BUSINESS, BOTH IN QUALITY CONTROL AND CARING ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. THE ONLY THING THAT HOLDS ME BACK FROM RATING THIS PRODUCT A 5 STAR IS THAT IT IS A LITTLE PRICY. I ALSO FEEL THAT MIXING FIBER WITH A FAST ACTING PROTEIN LIKE WHEY ISOLATE IS A BIT OF A CONTRADICTION, BUT AT LEAST YOU KNOW YOU'RE GETTING QUALITY INGREDIENTS HERE. IF YOU LIKE YOUR PROTEIN SHAKES TO BE THICKER, DONT GET THE LOW CARB, AND GET THE REGULAR ONE INSTEAD."
3,Tastes Great! but...,That's one of the best tasting meal replacement shakes out there. I got the vanilla ice cream one. The only problem is that for some reason my stomach can't handle it very well. I would recommend it because it tastes great and I know I'm probably one of the few exceptions and so I wouldn't buy it again for myself.
4,Medium,"Took longer than I wanted to ship, but arrived. They were also helpful in responding to my questions."
5,Great protein,Its great for fast breakfast or when you are on the go and just need something to eat/drink fast or after a work out
4,Good Tasting Low Carb Protein Powder,"I was very pleasantly surprised with the taste of the low carb isopure. I'd used the regular chocolate a long time ago. Low carb has come a long way. I'm pretty hard to please with protein bars & shakes and this is pretty good. Slightly overly sweet though. I prefer Myoplex lite, but the carbs are much higher there."
5,Labrada Lean Body,Finally found this product at a reasonable price on Amazon!!! Great for my mobile lifestyle; and it tastes great too! Thanks!
3,Isopure or Labrada reviews?,I was looking at the Labrada Nutrition Carb Watchers Lean Body Hi-Protein Meal Replacement shakes and most of the 88 reviews are for Isopure Protien shakes? Why is that?
4,Wicked Ernest,"John Wardroper has chosen to tread on forbidden paths with ""Wicked Ernest"" and expose the 'Demon Duke' who was accused of incest, murder and, possibly, sodomy. He approaches the topic as a scholar, providing much documented proof and presents it in an easy to read, interesting book about the seldom heard of Prince Ernest, Duke of Cumberland, son of King George III. Extensive research is apparent throughout the work as, understandably, much of the evidence has been destroyed. I liked this book very much and recommend it to history buffs. Thanks, Mr. Wardroper."
5,Quality kitchen tongs,The Cuisipro Silicone Locking Tongs are comfortable to use and easy to lock/unlock.
4,good romance,"Suzanne Hartwell is a dedicated career woman who is going to let nothing stop her from the promotion she wants. To achieve her promotion, she has to convince sexy rancher Rafe McAllister to sell his ranch to the development company she works for so they can build a shopping mall. Rafe has lived his whole life on the Lazy M Ranch. When his father died, the ranch was left on the verge of bankruptcy. Rafe is working hard to keep the ranch and fight off the developers. When Rafe meets sexy Suzanne, he has no idea she's working for the enemy even though he realizes she's on the other side of the development issue. Rafe challenges Suzanne to tour his ranch and see if she still thinks it should be turned into a shopping center. The more time Suzanne spends with Rafe on his ranch, the more she realizes she needs to find a way to help the man she loves save his ranch not destroy it.This book had a good story line. Suzanne's growth as a person was believable."
5,the definitive guide is here!,"The good news about this fantastic compilation by Gail Fitch is that it clearly presents the wide variety of horse molds that the Hartland companies created, in far more colors and variations than most of us thought possible. The bad news is that now we collectors finally know for sure how many of these beauties we don't have in our collections! Ms. Fitch has done another outstanding job cataloguing and presenting this subset of Hartland items. I've been waiting for this since my very first Hartlands so many years ago. Your collection deserves this volume!"
1,Not a top quality book-Helpful ID guide but I've seen better,"Good id guide, but not as well done as the hardcover Breyer book.Maybe worthwhile for the hardcore collector. The writing in parts is overblown and self-aggrandizing if you ask me, but photos helpful. Also a bit overpriced for a softcover guide like this, but the publisher sells it on discount."
4,Gritty and Enjoyable,"Stuart Pawson had a career as a mining engineer He followed this with a spell working for the probation service, before he became a full-time writer. He lives in the pleasant waterside village of Fairburn in Yorkshire. The author's writing is gritty and to the point added to which he has a likeable sense of humour that he usually incorporates into his books, all of which I have found enjoyable.DI Charlie Priest is mulling over the fact that as the saying goes a copper is never off duty. Although supposedly on sick leave he has been asked to keep an eye on a well known drugs courier, who uses the Hull-Rotterdam route on a regular basis. He is also concerned for the safety of his girlfriend as she spies on a tobacco company and their sales operation in Africa.Stuart Pawson's books are to me at least, a cut above the average crime novel. As I said earlier, he has a dry wit that transmits itself to the reader and makes the reading of his books that much more enjoyable an experience."
2,Slicing / Pinching Issues,"These are heavy duty tongs with the perfect length for reaching into and turning items in woks, frying pans and pots in the oven. However, every time I use them, I nearly slice off my pinkie finger, which ruins my enjoyment of cooking. It is extremely painful and I keep forgetting to put on dish or oven gloves before handling these tongs. There is a design flaw that should be corrected for health and safety reasons."
4,Great all around tongs.,"I needed a set of tongs that I could use for multiple purposes. These are just the tongs for everything. They are sturdy enough to turn heavy steaks, and can be used in all pans because of the silicone tips. They grip well, and the locking feature keeps them closed while they are in the drawer. Overall a very well made item."
4,Work well,"These tongs work well. At times they are a bit hard to manage. The silicone is more flexible than metal tongs, so sometimes it's hard to get a good grip on the food, especially if it's a heavy piece of meat. But overall, I like them. At least I know they won't scratch my cookware."
1,A Painful Experience,"Bought a pair of these recently because I wanted soft tongs to use on non-stick cookware. Every few times I squeeze them, the tongs pinch the skin on my middle and ring fingers due to the numskull design of leaving the stainless tong edges sharp. The edges meet one another just like scissors. Because I don't like wasting $13, I will be taking a hammer to the edges and smashing them flat.Buy these if you are a masochistic chef that likes the feeling of your skin being pinched between the jaws of pliers.Otherwise, look elsewhere."
3,Okay.,"The length is just right for most of the things I've used it for and it's easy to clean and feels fairly solid in the hand, but I tried using it to turn a small rump roast while browning and it just wasn't strong enough. This is a problem as that was one of the main tasks I'd planned on using it for when I ordered.It is very useful for lighter use such as removing garlic bread from baking sheets, etc."
5,A magical book for children,"My granddaughters, 26 month-old sisters, adore this book. They sit quietly, turning the pages, naming the objects and colors, fascinated by the mixture of photographed and painted people, fruit, animals, scenery. It's a wonderful book for the imagination and for vocabulary-bulding."
1,From a new teacher,I was very disappointed with this book. There is not much contained in it. All of the examples (which are few) are scribbley pictures done by other teachers--very poorly done.
4,Great Book,"This book is a great book for magicians of all ages. In here, it teaches all of the basics and some more advanced card tricks. Almost a must for the beginning magician."
3,Caution- Trigger is Sharp!,Great trimmer. Packaging was poor from Amazon's supplier and resulted in a bent blade arm. Returned and bought it at the local big box store. Watch out for the sharp edges on the orange plastic around the trigger- I cut my trigger finger fairly deeply. Suggest that buyers sand down the plastic in this area and/or try to wear gloves. The basic hardware store leather gloves didn't fit this handle well for me. I have notified B&D to suggest a product update.
4,So far so good,"This trimmer does an amazing job compared to what I was able to do with hand trimmer. Better results in 1/20th the time. My trimmer arrived by ups and the box had been broken and retaped. I looked closely and the blade was bent about 3/16"" in the same place the box was broken. But it seems to work fine and it cost to much to send it back. So, I'll live with the question mark. If I knew about the flimsy packaging I would have bought it local."
5,The perfect hog!,"I live on a ten acre ranch and there is lots of ""bushy-grassy"" landscaping. Never lets me down. Sure faster and easier than hedge clippers!"
5,Super Trimmer,"I've been using a 18 inch Sears gas trimmer for years. The Hedge Hog beats in hands down in every way. Powerful, fast cutting, light weight and those extra inches comes in very handy. The only negative thing I can think of is that you are tied to a power cord.Buy yourself two fifty foot 12guage extension cords and you will be able to handle most of the jobs around your home. I live on an acre but the 100 foot cord lets me get to about 90 percent of my trimming needs. One other thing, how about a 30 inch (or larger) model ?"
5,Trimming Made Easy,"Wow. What a difference over my old little trimmer. This makes the task of trimming bushes fast, easy, and fun."
4,"Lean and mean, does the job","This trimmer was every bit as good as I had hoped. I don't know if that comes from the fact that this trimmer is better or because he was able to finish the job faster than before, thus less time holding the trimmer. I am impressed! We bought this trimmer for a large row of privet hedges around our yard. Trimming this has always been a dreaded chore but not so much anymore! The 24 in size is great and allows us to trim the top in one pass instead of two. As the hedge has grown larger and older, some of the thicker pieces have been impossible to trim with our old trimmer but this one handled it with no problem. I also noticed that my hands felt less ""shaky"" after using this trimmer."
5,Amazing Trimmer!,"Needed to replace an old B & D trimmer which never really worked very good - so was looking for a different brand name. But, B & D seems to have most of the available trimmers on the market - so in a ""leap-of-faith"" I ordered this B & D model. WHAT A PLESENT SURPRISE!! It WORKS GREAT! The bushes look better then they ever did! So, go ahead and buy it - I am sure you will like it!"
5,great hedgetrimmer,"I've used a gas powered hedgetrimmer for 15 years. It was heavy and hard to trim the hedges evenly. I love this trimmer; it seems just as powerful as the gas powered one, but it is half the weight! It is easier to trim my hedges evenly. Thanks"
3,Heavy hog...,"This thing is a lot heavier than I expected. It cuts well, but it will not come close to cutting 3/4 inch branches as advertised. In fact, it takes multiple efforts to cut 1/2 inch branches. If you need a long hedger, this is a good choice, but remember, it's heavy!"
5,"very powerful, gets the job done","This is pretty much the smallest trimmer with enough power to trim the tall bushes for me. The bushes are often got 7 to 8 feet tall, branches are very thick, this trimmer can get them trimmed although sometime needs several passes but it gets them trimmed."
4,Effective Hedge Trimmer,"This hedge trimmer does exactly what Black&Decker claim it will. It cuts quickly and easily. It can be a touch slow on the bigger branches that are quoted within the size limits. Otherwise, great product so far. I have only used it a couple times and owned it for only a few months, so I can't comment on longterm reliability."
4,more power to ya',"This is a much better choice thanthe cheaper model Hedge Hog. Morecomfortable design and much morepower. Able to cut larger diameterbranches with ease. Pay a littlemore, but get much more performancein return."
4,color me b&d surprised -- very satisfied,"after many tools and many years of low-cost b&d disappointments, this one is a winnah! it replaces a 17"" electric weedeater and cut my time in half. bar length, cutting aperture, and power are nicely matched, making this the right tool for certain trimming jobs. this was great at leveling out my 7' high, 80' long burning bush hedge; fairly easy to reach out from a stepladder for shoulder-level horizontal cuts, and very easy for vertical cuts - good handle ergonomics. it was only ""good"" at my forsythia hedge - too many 5/8 and 3/4 cuts on fibrous woody stems. take the 3/4"" spec with a little skepticism -- rarely will most people get to approach the cut on those at perfect right angles so you may need to mentally ""de-rate"" the spec to 1/2 or or 9/16. even so, the trimmer's a pleasant surprise, and gets the job done. try for a price match at your local bricks+mortar store to get it today and minimize the hassle of returns."
5,Better than expected,"When I first used the B&D HH2450 I was suprized at how easy it cut my shrubs and bushes. The action was very smooth. As long as the branches are not too big, it will cut through them fairly easily. Love the additional 2' of blade. I really thought a corded electric hedger would be cumbersome, but it was not. The HH2450 is ligh and easy to handle. if you are considering a corded hedger, this should be at the top of the list"
4,Almost perfect.,"I'm truly sorry I can't give five stars. The thing that drops it down is the ability of the blade arm to bend up or down accidentally. This is not critical but could cause problems. Plus if the arm is bent the blades cannot move freely, therefore overheating the motor and not being able to cut at its impressive best. Otherwise it works like a hot knife through butter. (Who said that?) One thing I've found helpful is when I'm trimming off the bottoms of my bushes if I just turn over the trimmer the bottom of the handle gives me just as good a grip with two hands as the top. Plus, I don't have as much trouble with triggering it to turn off accidentally when I had it locked on."
5,Wife's new Hedge Hog,"I bought the 24-inch Hedge Hog for my wife to replace the old one she was using. When she held one at the local store she complained that it was too heavy (I hadn't told her that I had already ordered her one). Once the Hedge Hog arrived, and she used it, she fell in love with it because it cut and shaped the headges in a fraction of the time of the old one, plus it vibrated less. She told me it wasn't too heavy in action, thank goodness, or I might have had to take over the yard work. it's great to have a woman who likes yard work."
1,Careful whom you order from,"As you can see by the image, this is supposed to be the metal bodied 24"" trimmer... what the vendor I got it from sent was a plastic housed unit with some swivel setup.. (trash).. I was given an absolute runaround from them and finally gave up on the return process (were setting me up to whack me for 20% return fee) B&D; was USELESS and have never responded to calls or emails. B&D; has always be sufficiently good for home use and some of their stuff even cuts muster for light professional use..They (B&D; and retailer) have really dropped the ball on this and I am really disappointed in the lack of customer service from the retailer especially (Remodelr) This purchase turned out to be a joke and it was on me..."
1,how can this be a problem,The on and off switch is deep in a hole surrounded by hard plastic. Turning it on and off scrapes your thumb. Really ridiculous! Who are these engineers???
1,Inadequate Packaging- Bent Blade Arm,"Poor packaging from the Amazon supplier resulted in the blade arm being bent in transit... Lose, lose situation for everyone involved. Me, UPS, Amazon, and their seller. I have returned this one and will try again in a few weeks to see if they improve the packaging requirements or just go buy one from Home Depot."
1,electric hedge trimmer,The item delivered by ups was damaged. The item was in original box and had been wet and the parts were lying on porch outside box. There were no contact numbers and I didn't know what contents to look for. I called UPS and made them come pick it up. I then called a number and talked to someone who asked me if I wanted a refund or if I wanted another shipped. I requested another one to be shipped. I expressed my dissatisfaction as to the method they used to ship it. There was no wrapping just the box it came in. Very shortly UPS came back with same item and box was taped up but bottom half of box was torn and hanging out. I have not checked the item to see if it works but I will notify you if it is defective. I did not like the way it was shipped or delivered.
5,The Best Trimmer,"This is the best trimmer that I have owned. It trims everything very well. I like the extended cutting bar, the short electrical cord and the powerful motor."
3,Just okay,I purchased this item based on all the high reviews. My experience with using this item was not that complimentary. This hedge trimmer has a very long handle and motor area making it a little cumbersome to use. It's cutting blades and ability to cut through hedge branches show mediocre performance at best. I had an older generic hedge trimmer which was 10 years old and worked as well as this trimmer. Actually I would still be using my old trimmer except for the fact it was stolen. My rating of 3 stars is all this item can muster.
1,Good for about 15 minutes,"Worked great for literally 15 minutes!!I had high hopes for this product. B&D; isn't really known for their quality these days but the reviews seemed to be mostly positive. I guess I shouldn't really knock the product too much since I went the cheap option and got a ""refurbished"" one. Buyer beware. I guess refurbished means buying a formally broken one. If you really want this trimmer forget the $20 you will save by buying a refurbished one. I bought a new one from Home Depot for the same price. At least if it breaks I can just take it back to the store same day. With B&D; that is probably likely."
3,NOT ENOUGH POWER FOR TOUGH JOBS,"LIKED THE REACH YOU GET WITH THIS CUTTER, EASY TO HANDLE AND WILL DO A GREAT JOB OF NEW GROWTH AND MODERATE SIZE HEDGE. NOT ENOUGH POWER FOR LARGER BRANCHES OR TOUGH SHRUBS."
4,STOP THE SHEIK!,"This film, which is part fiction and part documentary, takes us back to the days of Bigtime Wrestling based in Detroit. If you are looking for rare footage of The Sheik, Abdullah The Butcher, The Funks, and Andre The Giant this is required viewing. This tape is not for everyone. Detroit wrestling was EXTREMELY violent, and the blood does flow in I Like To Hurt People. Among the film's highlights; television interviews with a 28 year old Dusty Rhodes, the late Abdullah Farouk (The WWF's Grand Wizard), and the legendary Bobo Brazil."
2,Review of One Sister Too Many!,"I don't think that the book One Sister Too Many by Carol Perry was very good. It had a really good meaning though. It was about two stepsisters that meet each other for the first time and all they do is fight. They eventually forget about everything they were fighting about. The things they fought about were pointless so I didn't like it very much. If you like books like that though, then this would be a good book for you."
1,Classical music not Joe Jackson.,"Its so hard to buy CD's now days, I buy artists I know and like, and it's something different. I noticed that I was only reviewing my favorite CD's all 5 stars. I just noticed the same thing here, if you like classical music you like this one and give it a good reviews. But I would bet that 9 out of 10 Joe Jackson fans don't like this CD. You look it up on amazon it has a 5 star rating you buy it and it's classical music. I laughed when one 5 star rater called this one hard to listen to, then why the 5 star rating?"
4,"not a Technics, but second best","very good table for the money. if you aren't going to spend almost double for a Technics M5G, the best table ever made, then this is a valid alternative.has more ""bells and whistles"" than the Technics, including a reverse feature, amazing pitch range (from +/- 8% up to 50%), and phono/line out switch option. however, the pitch fader just isn't as smooth and precise as a M5G (but then again, nothing is). i've owned a pair and was quite happy with them."
2,Too Old Fashioned for My Taste,"The write up of this book sounded interesting, but the writing was too old fashioned and pretentious for my taste."
2,One gets what one pays for,This was a free loan and its cost is what it was worth. Boring. I expected much more. It is my hope that my pets have a much fuller life.
4,"a little short, but really good","This was a very satisfying read, with the Iron Man and all, but it was a little bit short. This is supposed to be a children's book, but actually, the end expresses Ted Hughes' views on world peace. Very good for a children's story. I think that the part where they trap the IM is a little sad; after all, he does try to escape, and again, the adults laugh with glee, leaving the kid Hogarth to feel guilty."
2,making the simple difficult,"The title is what lured me to start reading this book.Basically, the book is FULL of long difficult words and by no means conversational or ""fun"" to read. It requires the reader to concentrate intensely in the later chapters to understand the message. The book only briefly mentions a few select thoughts by Graham and Buffett and misses a lot of the important insights and timeless wisdom of both men.This book is more focused on the authors aspect of value investing and can be seen by his detailed (and unnecessary 20+ pages) of corporate governance and macro economics.I don't know whether he was trying to write a novel here with all sorts of metaphors, adjectives and 'colorful' descriptions which does not make sense when related to finance and investing.Better value investing books out there for sure."
3,An introduction to Graham & Buffet's Value Investing,"For any reader or beginner who likes to have a very brief idea of what Graham and Buffet preach on value investing, this book is okay.In order to make the book readable and interesting, the author had chosen not to go into details of how but focus mostly on principles. About 35% of the book is spent, in text and no data/graph, on validating value over price as the primary consideration of any investment. I think that's far too much. That makes the part on the assessment of the true value of a stock too simple and short.Anyway, this is just an introduction of value investing (like the first chapter in a 12 chapter book) and far from complete. Stronly suggest any aspired value investor or even trader to read the originals from Graham and Buffet for a full picture before they take up one of the most competitive and demanding job in the world."
1,The title does not keep what it promise,"This book is really disappointing, because it has very little to do with the title of the book. It is a total waste of money. After reading this book, you will hardly thing like Graham and invest like Buffett. No chance! Read the first two books from Hagstrom and Buffett's letters to the shareholders. Don't by this one. Terrible!"
2,Horrible writing style,The author pretends to sound sophisticated throughout the book. I was able to skip paragraphs and still get the main ideas. My middle finger to the author!
3,Good for beginners but ...,"This book might be good for those who are new to Graham and Buffett but once you get some experience with investing, you most likely won't need it.I would suggest getting a used copy and read it.I also agree with another commentor that the writing is way to academic in this book.I also agree that the Warren Buffett essays and annual reports are much better, not to mention directly from the source."
3,Excellent for beginners only !!,"Well, this book is suitable for beginners without reading books of these 2 masters before, with some explanation on fundamental raios (like P/E, Profit Margin, ROE...etc).However, it's not infomative for people like me, who has read the books about Benjamin Graham and Buffett before.Besides, the book is relative poor and vague in stating the investment philosophies of the masters (e.g. Without the descriptions of ""Selection of Criteria"" and ""Margin of Safety"" from Ben).The format is relative poor, it's not easy to have a clear ideas towards the ideas of Ben and Buffett, as well as the differences of their philosophies.However, I really appreciate the book's mention on ""Accounting frauds"" and the ""Differences between the US & European coporations"".If you want to know more about the two investing masters, you'd better read ""Intelligent Investors"" written by Ben as well as ""Buffetology"", ""Warren Buffett's Portfolio"" about Buffett."
2,Disappointing,"I believe that this book might be interesting for someone who is unfamiliar with value investing, but I must warn the more experienced reader that not much of new ideas are to found in this book. What surprises me most of all is that the author devotes the first half of his book to convincing people that marekts are inefficient. But what guy believing in efficient markets would ever consider buying a book on investing in the first place ? Right: anyone interested in this book can skip the first half. The second half is rather superficial and brings nothing new on the table for people familiar with value investing. My advice: avoid this book and buy instead 'The essays of Warren Buffet' of the same author. The latter is really a must-read for anyone serious about investing !"
5,Underestimated,"I believe that this was more action packed and more interesting than the first one. I was very impressed and I also liked the Skaven rivalry as well, which makes it even more interesting."
5,I love this book!,"This easy-to-use book is full of creative play activities that incorporate learning skills. I like this book because the author shows you how to use common household items to make simple artwork. For that reason the projects are spontaneous. You can pick up the book and do a project without a lot of preparation. The accompanying illustrations can be copied or used right out of the book. Each project suggests easy art activities for beginners with tiny fingers -- perfect for toddlers. In the process, children learn letters, shapes, colors, and develop fine motor skills."
3,Public Speaking DVD,A little juvenile but would be great to use in a high school beginning speech class
3,LEGO BIONICLE - Visorak Roporak,"My grandson would NOT put it down until he finished it. His is 10 years old seem to be mechinally inclined, he didn't ask for help."
5,With over 100 black-and-white and color photographs,"Elvis In Hawai'i is a unique look at the life of the legendary rock singer Elvis Presley, focusing especially on his love of the Hawai'ian islands and the people who lived there. Elvis' fondness of his favorite vacation spot is brought to life with over 100 black-and-white and color photographs, some never before published, and an upbeat yet adroitly narrated text by Jerry Hopkins. Elvis In Hawai'i is especially recommended reading for the legions of fans and admirers of ""The King"" of rock 'n roll."
3,Seek and you shall find,"Waite is always informative, sometimes frustrating, and always opinionated. This book is no different. Well thought out, full of rigid opinion, and a disagree with the end premise. I am, however, better off for having read it and do recommend it to students of the Rose and Cross. LVX"
3,Hidden Power for students of photo editing,"Hidden Power was too deep for me, it may best be used as a textbook for a formal class on Photoshop Elements.It sits on a bookshelf with Photoshop Elements Classroom In A Book by Adobe and some other books that I'm saving to read when I'm immobilized with broken legs and I have lots of time to spend reading.My interest in buying this book was it's advertisement stating it has a CD that will add Curves functions to PS4. I couldn't get it to work.If editing photos is a hobby and not your profession, I found the books Easy Photoshop Elements and 50 Fast Digital Photo Techniques with Photoshop Elements to be the fastest and easiest way to learn editing techniques."
1,I have not received my order - so I cannot rate or review it,"My order was supposed to arrive by December 7th. Today is Dec 9th. The order was placed in October - that's a long wait for a start. This is my first order - I am disappointed and totally unimpressed by Amazon's service. Someone else may like to review ""The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 4"" since I cannot.Would be 'they have my money' customer -Leigh de Kraker"
5,Beautiful,Beautiful knives!! They just slice through meat without destroying it! Very happy with my purchas!! They are a tiny bit thinner than I expected but they are still amazing! Love them
3,"Great photos, text could be better","GREAT info for the Nancy Drew lover. This would get 5 stars for the inclusion of photos from the books alone. The writing could have been more detailed and written a bit better. I DID like that the authors included information from the period during which the NDs were written -- the '30s through today -- and how teens were changing over the years. Nancy Drew changed and grew along with today's teens, although die-hard fans wish the syndicate hadn't changed a WORD.I was a little disappointed with the reading of the book, but had just finished ""The Nancy Drew Scrapbook"" which is AWESOME, so that might be why I was expecting more from this book. I LOVED all the photos, tho, lots of nostalgia!"
5,ARETHA STILL THE QUEEN OF SOUL,My name is Reka and I saved to get this cd box Ihave every album but they are worn out. I WISH I COULD GET IN CD THE ALBUM LAUGHING ON THE OUTSIDE//////////
5,Excellent Box Set,"Aretha Franklin is and always will be an excellent singer. The great thing about this box set is it was done correctly. It has everything you would want and more during her 10 years with Atlantic. The packaging is superb and entertaining.All Aretha fans should own this even if you have her studio albums and/or greatest hits albums. By buying this will save you from buying her ""30 greatest hits"" and the two Rhino ""Best Of..."" from the 1960s and 1970s. Highly Recommended."
5,THIS IS IT!!!!,"If you want a serious compilation, a tribute to the gorgeous, sexy, brilliant, earthy, soul sister of sisters, then this is the real thing--this, my friend, is it. The soul of Aretha Franklin, THE QUEEN OF SOUL, is all over this set of impressive, superb recordings. You will need no others. This is absolutely, hands down the best of the very, very best. When you hear this you will understand why she is royalty not only to her fans, but among her peers, if there indeed are any. And I will bet that you will have an awfully hard time staying on the road if you intend to play this music in your car, just as any gathering you might have will turn into party central if you play any of these CDs in your home. ENJOY!!"
5,"A ""must have"" for all Aretha fans","This is the definitive collection. It has all of the classics and some hidden treasures as well. I was initially worried that it would have all the standards and not much beyond that, but not true. There are enough new pieces and all the ones you already know and love that it makes the perfect combination. If you were to own only one CD or CD set of Aretha Franklin, this is the one."
2,Nice visuals - hazy story,"Although there definately *is* a good story somewhere in there, it's often cast-aside as some sort of sub-plot to the imagery, which is unfortunate. Still, I liked the ingenuity of it's visuals and effects, and it's worth renting on that basis. Actually deserves 2.5..."
2,Another poor DVD from Manga Ent.,"I will not go into detail about the film itself - other people have done that. Instead I am going to discuss the EXTREEMLY POOR job MANGA ENT. has done in bringing it to DVD. I recently bought the Japanese DVD of TETSUO 2 and it has got audio commentary by the director, a making-of-documentary and a photo gallery. None of the above are on this DVD which is a shame because TETSUO is cult cinema and a special edition treatment (especially a subtitled audio commentary track a la WINGS OF HONNEAMISE) would have been most welcome. The only good thing I can say about this disc is that MANGA at least offers the original Japanese version with subtitles as opposed to their DVD of the two DEVILMAN OVAs which you have to watch dubbed or not at all (the latter is recommended)."
3,Intense to the point of confusion,"After watching this movie, I was more or less at a loss for words. I thought it was horrible, yet so intense that it left a ""want to see it again"" mark in your brain. It definitely is not for everybody, and people who expect a Futuristic/Cyberpunk genre when looking for movies should completely avoid this. On the other hand, fans of Japanese Anime and just trippy movies in general should not miss a chance at grabbing a copy. I personally liked and disliked it at the same time because I expected a whole different movie, but was still taken in by the originality, presentation, and just sickness of the visuals and plot. I'll keep it safe and give it a neutral score..."
3,fits the price,"It is a great product for its price. The cord binds very easily however, and seems to have more feedback than my other ones. It is perfect for its price though."
5,"Great Guitar Cable, Good Value - Highly Recommended","This Hosa Cable is very well made, with good quality connectors and a nice long length. My son is expanding his collection of amps and effects pedals so needed additional cables to get everything connected. This 25' cable gives him flexibility to move around and it is sturdy enough that it can take being stepped on and pulled around.The cable works well and is a good value for a decent quality cable.Highly Recommended!CFH"
1,Very Cheap,I ordered this today and part of it chipped within 15 minutes. It's very cheap though you get what you pay for.
4,Very practical knife,Great deal for this lightweight folder - very useful for everyday carry and chores. Serrated blade cuts through rope easily. I generally carry it most of the time.
1,Blade is dull and not hard.,I have to disagree with the four and five star reviews on this item. My blade was very dull. It would not cut skin even under considerable force. The blade also chipped and the tip bent on just a little misuse. The pocket clip is handy but mine stretched out within the first week and now it slips easily out of my pocket if anything at all such as seatbelt puts a little force on the knife. The knife does come with a pretty nice thumb action but I would definitely pass on this knife.12/17/12 update. blade lock just broke after knife fell on floor from 4 feet elevation. cheap made in china junk. pass.
3,aaa,"Hi. I must say,that the blade was not really sharped.the plastic handle is very weak. The onely good thing i can sayIT IS VERY LIGHTWEIGHT!!!"
5,love my new knife,"I've had the knife for a few weeks now, and for the price it's an excellent knife! I carry it w/ me everywhere and have used it several times, it comes in very handy! love it! thinking of buying more for gifts!"
3,Maxam Knife,"I bought these to use at my vacuum shop. They were a bit bigger than I thought, but work just fine. The blade does not hold a sharp edge for very long, but it is not an expensive knife. Good feel and easy fold and unfold."
5,Love it!!!,"My four year old loves whales, especially Beluga Whales. This was perfect for her mommy and baby collection. And it is so big, we will have a hard time losing it."
5,"Absolute ""Must have"" for any dog owner.","I love this book.It is easy to read and understand. It starts with evaluation of the dog and assesing the strenght and weakness of his/her learning abilities. Training...or better called teaching-is set of games, what dogs love.I really appreciate the teaching strategy of looking at owner and paying attention- without jerking collar or using prong collars! That's an absolut must in training.There is also part about bad habits. And some Earth energy massage for your dog, if you are into ""chi""."
5,Great,I bought these for my elementary school kids and they love them...I also use them for my neighborhood kids. So far no problems.
5,Pow-Wow!,"By the time I finished CHAPTER 6 (no worries, they are all very short chapters), I feel as if I have used SAP! It's amazingly simple (yet comprehensive) in its explanation and you don't need to be a technological buff to understand SAP/ this book! Highly recommends this INCREDIBLE book to all out there who have always wanted to know about SAP but have no experience with it!Also provides very precise step-to-step guide with pictures of the SAP dialogue box. Whoa!"
1,doesn't explain how SAP works,"I wanted to learn how SAP models a business, e.g., what data are represented and how information flows from one module to another. This book alternates between the overly general (paragraphs that say nothing) and the overly specific (screen shots of what a clerk might see).If you have any kind of programming or computer science background, you'll find this book irritating."
3,it simply describes the ideal world with SAP,"As an absolute beginner I was given this book, the first 250 pages are readable, explaining what SAP is and can do for your company. The examples from ""before SAP"" (panic striking, real life situations) and ""after SAP"" (idyllic world where all problems are solved) are a bit exagerated. For beginners :skip all the detailed work for later (screen, after screen, after screen..) when you have your SAP machine up and running."
3,more than enough..,"very useful if combine usage with the textbook.. alot of practices in terms of grammer, writing, reading and listening (files can be found online, troublesome though but it's better than nothing)..BUT.. the workbook doesnt come with answers.. you have to check it aganist your textbook... which can be kind of troublesome...This series of textbooks/workbooks are more inclined for classroom teaching.. nevertheless it's more than enough for DIY learning as well...."
1,Where is the CD?????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The workbook is meant to be compatible with a cd. The first exercise you are supposed to listen to is a conversation about everyday expressions and circle the expression you hear. Problem is... there is no cd to listen to the conversations!!!!!!! The textbook is well written but not including the cd is really stupid. Why not include the cd or make one available?? Extremely dissapointed with the workbook.
3,"Integrated Korean Workbook, Beginning 1 by Carol Schulz","I NEED YOUR HELP. I BOUGHT THIS BOOK ONLY TO FIND THAT IT SHOULD ACTUALLY COME WITH AUDIOCASSETTES FOR THE LISTENING ACTIVITIES. THE SELLER SAID THEY DID NOT HAVE THE AUDIOCASSETTE. MY QUESTION IS WHERE CAN I GET THE CASSETTE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THIS BOOK IS OF NO USE. I HOPE YOU OR ANYONE WHO READ THIS MESSAGE CAN HELP ME. BY THE WAY, IF YOU HAVE THE E-MAIL OF THE KOREAN LANGUAGE EDUCATION AND RESEARCH CENTER (KLEAR) OR UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI'I PRESS, PLEASE TELL ME. THANK YOU SO MUCH."
1,Not for cold weather,"This worked just fine until the weather gets below freezing (perhaps the worst time to get locked out). The mechanism freezes up and it no longer works, leaving you outside looking in."
4,Good system with some flaws,"I also realized that we need a much better system after seeing ""It Takes a Thief"". We bought this to put a spare key outside and have the key box inside. It is very handy and we have already used it several times. Hopefully its use will taper off as I start remembering to take my keys all the time :PLike the other reviewers, I would love it if the sequence of the numbers would matter in the combination. I also didn't want to have to pay an arm and a leg so this will due. It is much, much better than hiding a key, making copies of keys for people to lose (or copy themselves), etc. We feel like we have much more control over who can get access to our home and who has keys to our home. I would definately recommend for everybody to get one of these little devices and install it. Installation is a breeze."
4,Key box works well,"Easy to install. Feels sturdy and secure. A bit ""fiddley"" to open but I feel I will do better with practice."
5,A must for every homeowner,"This is a must for every homeowner. Your key to your house is safe, secure and you will NEVER be locked out again. Very easy to set combo."
5,Good product. Does what it's meant to.,"I bought this for my parents house. It's very heavy and well-made. It was easy to set up and set the combo. Be aware, however, that a duplicate # will not register. In other words, if you choose 4454, once you hit the 4 the first time, you can't depress the 4 again. No big deal to me--we just chose a combo with no repeats. It's worked like a charm for several months now, so I bought one for my own house. Nice to have an emergency key around that you feel is safe from those who are unathorized."
2,not secure,"this isn't a very secure product. there are only 210 possible combinations, which take about 45 minutes to run through. you'll often find the combination in about 25 minutes. 5040 possible codes, of which 24 are the same (4567 is the same as 7654, 7546, 4675, etc.) = 5040/24 = 210. a simple VB program can list all the combos.keep this lockbox out of sight."
4,emergancy key safe,This will give Police and Fire dept.an emergancy key to enter the house so they dont have to breack down doors.
5,Lock Box is Perfect,"After checking on alot of different styles of lock boxes, my far this one is the best and so easy to use."
3,lockbox,the lock box is fine but the fire departmeny wtll not use it as a way in to our house in case of fire or accident and so it is usless in case i pass out and get to the door.Spare Key Lock Box
1,GE Junk,"It's hard to figure out how to set a code. I gave up. And you have to have five numbers in the passcode and can't repeat any of them, so we can't use any of the codes we use in my family and would need to invent a new one that we will all have to write down somewhere. Only a giant bureaucracy like GE could produce something this user-hostile. Why can't I use the code I want? Why is it so hard to set? Only the GE committee of 17 engineers that designed this clunker know the answer, I guess."
2,lockboxes,Great boxes. Use them in our resorts for late nite guests. Much easier to use then the old dial combo ones. Better price fron Amazon and very fast delivery.
5,5 Stars for Me Too,"GE AccessPoint Slimline KeySafe 2-Key Case, White #001413Great product.- Heavy Duty.- Everything well made.- Combo easy to set and flexible (nothing needed to read).- Easy to install (minutes). Mount on to something via 4 screws. If masonary or drywall, you will need to purchase drill bit and sleeves for screws. This product weighs a pound or two. Its heavy duty.My application:Condo front door. If I forget my key while taking out the trash, lockout service costs $20 - $75 and wait time. This key container was a no-brainer for me. And I did not want the padlock kind. Its a permanent install for me. My neighbors already asking about it."
5,Don't even think about hiding your front door key under a rock,An excellent little product that everyone should consider. Safely and securely allows you to put a set of keys with easy access to you and your family. Perfect for families with kids who have a tendency to lose keys.
2,Seriously dumb,"If you dont mind having your key attached to a weighty piece of concrete (feels like), and you dont mind struggling to hold a button down while taking several tries to put the key back in place, and if you dont mind that the ""combination"" can actually be done in any combination of thr actual one you set, well then this lock box is for you. As for me and my household its a piece of worthless junk!"
3,Tough to swallow,"Naomi is about to run off and marry Joe, but he is suddenly killed in a farming accident. She learns she is pregnant and, to avoid family disgrace, agrees to marry Caleb Evans, a cold, religious man. She has a daughter (Brook), and 19 years later Brook falls in love with Tony. But Caleb disapproves of him, and Naomi tries to get the two to elope. This betrayal of her father makes Brook hate her mother, and she leaves to become a missionary. Up to this point the book is pretty good, though melodramatic. Then it starts to crumble. Jump ahead another 19 years. Brook is a widow about to marry a stuffy old English colonel when she meets the vivacious, headstrong, utterly ""modern"" man Erik. She falls in love with him in two minutes and runs off with him when he demands it. What she sees in him is never revealed and, judging from her personality, seems impossible that she would like him at all. Glaspell writes this soap-opera-ish mess well, though, in a style that's sparse and controlled."
5,Charles-Review,"It is a good book for kids and its description of a freight train very good, particulary its details about a locomotive cab and the caboose and it was in the 1980s that cabooses started being eliminated from freight trains."
3,Comedy movie pack,"Item arrived as promised and in condition agreed on. Movies are all B&W and oldies, which is fine, but some of the movies were not the quality I had expected. (Noisy). It's ok if you like real oldies and the price was good."
5,Good tunes,"If you like civil war music this is a pretty good album Ashokan farwell is my favorite but the others do not all follow the ""fiddle"" music like I had hoped. if you are looking for authentic you got it. if you are looking for fiddle music just get the single with out the live track."
1,not worth it,"Excellent until it breaks. Same problem as many. Spool stops spinning while engine continues to run. Only 4th time i've used it, but am past warranty and not worth the money and time to take up with customer service. A real dissapointment. I would have gladly paid 50 more dollars for a well made trimmer."
1,Unfit for purpose,Nice ergonomics but business end -the trimmer head - spent more time rolling round my garden until it finally dissapaered into a drain. This head unit needs a complete redesign before it is going to be any good
1,Black Crap Decler,"Like everyone else, I bought this junk thinking it would work. It does; but if the string jams, the belt destroys the plastic gear it winds around.Buy 3 or 4 if you want it to last. Black and Decker is worthless and I advise shunning all their products."
1,"Even after recall, Serious problems with auto-feeder","Just wanted to say that I have one with the new cap and I still can't get more than 5 minutes before the nice ""auto-feeder"" either feeds all my line out or just fails to feed at all.It's especially bad when using the sidewalk trimmer mode (rotated 90 degress). In that mode the auto-feeder helps make it impossible to do the job.I've owned a few products from B&D; and for the most part they work fine. But this one is the most infuriating device I've ever used."
2,Buyer beware,Trim line can be used up quite quickly. Make sure to wear long pants when using the trimmer. The protective cap and the spool sometimes will disengage from the unit and fly all over the place.
1,Defective drive belt,"I bought this product at Home Depot two years ago. I've replaced the strings only once, so it's received pretty light use... and today the drive belt failed...shredded. Black & Decker does good marketing, but I've been disappointed with both this product and the hedgehog hedge trimmer. Strong sounding names, weak performance.Black & Decker GH1000 Grass Hog XP 14-Inch 7.2 Amp Electric String Trimmer/Edger"
1,Plastic gear and drive belt are poor quality,Have used my Black and Decker GH1000 for a year or so and it worked fine. I started to use it yesterday but the trimmer shaft did not turn! Took unit apart and found that the plastic gear and belt that allows the trimmer shaft to rotate were bad.I went to the internet and found the belt but the plastic gear comes with the motor (About $48.00). Barf!!!! Plan to send B+D a note but expect this is the end of the line.
1,Absolute Piece of Crap,"This trimmer is the last B&D product I ever buy. It goes through line like mad. It chops off the line in about 2 inch chunks and leaves them all over your yard. One of the replacement spools lasted about 2 trimmings for me and I have a small yard. The replacement spools are about $15 at Home Depot. I think B&D makes most of their money off the replacement spools. As mentioned by other reviewers, you better wear long pants when using this trimmer or you'll end up with welts and cuts on your shins. I got so frustrated with this trimmer I threw it in the trash. On second thought, I should of shipped the thing back to B&D."
3,B&D Grasshog trimmer GH1000,"This machine worked well UNTIL the first time used the cutter guaard fell off because the bolts that hold it on came out. No lock washers were supplied to hold them tight. Called three weeks ago for replacements, still have not arrived. The second time used the cap that holds the trimmer cartridge flew off, couldn't find it. Ordered a relacement . Still have not received it. The two items requested were to be sent in same package but were never shipped until the 20th of this month. Were ordered almost three weeks before. Order never processed on that date, not untill the 20th. Spoke to four different people requireing four different calls. The last call ,6\27/07 , was assured that it was on its way by snail mail I presume or deliverd by hand??? I am supposed to receive to replacement spools of line for the inconvenience????"
1,1 second of pure adrenaline,"I purchased a gh1000 today. What a mistake! I pulled out the cord, got super excited to tackle some of these raging neighboring properties around my home. Plugged it all in. Ready, ... SET, .......NO! This thing spun 10 times out of the box then died. Attempted to contact Black and Decker directly.... Result: finding and taking it to an authorized repair center. This is definitely not on my to do list within 45 minutes of purchasing something. Needless to say I will not waste my time on another of these ever-degrading products from this brand."
4,Great Job,"It took some getting used to this machine, my lawn edges looked bald after the first couple of tries. It is powerful but also well balanced so once the optimum cutting position is achieved it is easy to maneuver.I still haven't noticed the line feed system - there always seems to be the right amount of line even after cutting beside a concrete patio."
1,GH1000 is junk,"I bought this two summers ago to replace my gas powered Ryobi trimmer that works but is a pain to change the spool. Just like others have written, ""the shaft that links the motor to the head has become detached, broken or otherwise malfunctioned. The motor spins freely while the string doesn't move at all."" And, just like other reviewers, I really have used it very little, maybe less than six times. I have never had to replace the line, so I could not have used it that much.Maybe I will luck out and I am still under warranty, but it does not appear the hassle is worth it if I end with the same product."
1,Frustrating and worthless,"The double line spool holds very little line, and it runs out well before I'm done with the yard. My previous single-line lasted for the entire yard. This one lasts for a third of my yard. Trying to load the double-line spool was frustrating and time-consuming. I finally gave up. I returned this to Home Depot and happily got a refund.The engine is powerful, and the balance is very nice. It was great for weed-eating. However, I was unable to get a nice line between the sidewalk and the grass with this double-line design."
1,Absolutely the Worst,"I have the post-recall model, and yet this remains a front runner as the most poorly designed line trimmer being sold. The power of the motor is great, but that power is too much for the rest of the components.To wit: the spool housing is dense plastic connected to a metal ""driveshaft"". After only a few uses the plastic became deformed and stripped out. The driveshaft spins, but the spool does not rotate. The replacement part is about $15.00 delivered. What's the point.Just another problem to add the the growing list of issues with this item.Also, this unit has major line feed problems. I was constantly taking the spool out to re-feed the line. And when it did work, it used way more line than necessary."
1,awful,"Worthless. Worked for about an hour. Initially it fed too much and I wasted an entire spool as the line repeatedly snapped off and the bits of plastic were flung around my yard. Then it stopped feeding altogether. And then when I tried to replace the spool with fresh line it flung the spool off through the air and it landed in the road. A truck then ran over and broke its end piece; I ended up throwing it in the trash after about a week. Really bummed on this product, it deserves no stars."
4,So far so good,"I read these other reviews and found them all to be a little on the vague side. I decided to give this unit a try myself and have so far been very impressed. It is easy to use and I was able to clean up my whole front yard in less than an hour. That is saying a lot because I only just moved into this house and the previous owners did not take good care of the yard. The two-year warranty gives me peace of mind that even if what the other reviews say is true, I will still be covered. With that said, I will have to highly recommend this product. Give it a try!"
1,Dangerous Piece of Equipment,"This is simply a dangerous product. I have the supposedly ""fixed"" version with the orange spool head and tried to use it for the last two summers. The automatic string feed system constantly feeds excessive amounts of string, throwing up to 4-inch shards of string hitting me in the face, legs and body. As you can imagine, this is also a HUGE waste of time and string to frequently have to rethread the spool. I usually cannot complete one edging around my yard without having to rethread. To me this is a tremendous inconvenience and waste of money.I have tried the original B&D; trimmer string and a different brand of string to see if that fixed the problem. I have also tried winding the spool in different ways and nothing has worked.This is by the far the worst string trimmer I have ever used."
1,Horrible string feed mechanism...,This thing worked fine the first time I used it. I pulled it out today and it started feeding line a foot at a time. It got so out of hand that I now have multiple whelps on my legs and a few of them are bleeding. I was gonna try to respool the line but decided to check online for some tips on making it work better. It seems about the best advice anyone can give on this unit is to throw it in the trash before you start walking with a limp.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought mine in Nov 2009. It broke after 2 uses and this is my second grass hog, same problem everyone else is having the motor spins but the drive shaft doesn't. Don't waste your time and money get a better brand."
1,Cheap internals cause premature failure- Buy another brand,"Trimmer broke during 2nd season of weekly use for medium sized yard. I just trim grass with it. The plastic drive pulley melted. 5 cents worth of better materials would've eliminated this problem. Typical cheap Chinese junk with no thought for durability or repairability.Black & Decker will not sell you the pulley or belt, just the whole motor assembly (with cheap plastic pulley).This is not a green product if I can't repair it. I would happily pay a dollar or two more for better quality internals."
1,Avoid this product,"Super low quality. My yard is small, and I used this tool only lightly. Still, the spool melted as stated on many other reviews. Too bad I did not look at reviews before buying."
1,Problem not fixed by recall,"My problem has nothing to do with the recall issue of the string cap flying off.My unit is infrequently used -- I'm just about halfway through the first spool. The motor runs, but the spool doesn't spin.It's a bear to get the case apart -- they hid screws under the label. It's just as hard to get it back together. That is, it's NOT DESIGNED TO BE REPAIRED.The electric motor drives a belt to reduce the shaft speed. My belt slipped off. After re-assembly, it slipped off again in about two seconds.There is FAR TOO MUCH PLASTIC inside -- and significant wear on the inside of the case. I expect low quality on a cheap item, but this was marketed as a deluxe quality item."
1,The worst,"Can't use without their very expensive replacement spool. Torque converter does not work. If I had not spent so much, it would be in the trash."
1,"Recall fixed some problems, but...","After about 6 uses, the spinner stopped spinning, even though the motor was turning. I took it apart, and the plastic pulley that turned drive belt had *melted*. Unfortunately, the pulley itself can't be replaced unless you buy a new motor assembly for at least [...] bucks (just short of the cost of the trimmer itself). DO NOT BUY THIS TRIMMER unless you only plan on using it a few times during the life of the trimmer."
1,Bad product -- Don't buy,"First one taken back after 10 minutes of use. The cutting line somehow snagged the shield and ripped it off.The second one has a problem with the cap and spool flying off; Even during very light use. The motor seems good and the swivel design is nice but the spool mechanism is bad. When the spool cap flys off its like a spinner you had when you were a kid, better watch where it goes."
1,Absolute Garbage.,"The plastic sprocket for the drive belt will melt if you use the trimmer for more than 30 minutes in one day. They tried to save a nickel by using a cheap resin sprocket and in doing so, they turned what would have been a pretty good trimmer into a pile of molten plastic garbage. I got my first one replaced under warranty. I should have known better and been more careful with the replacement, but I eventually used it too long and it failed in the same fashion. I think I'm done with Black & Decker. It's a shame, too... they used to make decent products."
1,Not your Grandpas B&D,"I have a newer model string trimmer - one without the recall. Today was the 3rd time I used it. It broke. The motor runs, but the spool & line does not. I, like others, bought B&D because it WAS a name I respected. After finding the closest repair center is a 100 miles away, I am going to spend half the cost of the trimmer to send it for repairs. (Warranty doesn't cover shipping.) If you go to the B&D website you can see that B&D makes DeWalt and Stanley. If they have gone to making disposable equipment, you may want to avoid their other products."
1,good for six months only,bought at home depot in may 09 and it lasted for about 12 trims of my small yard then would only rotate at slow speed after that. returning it to some distant center is not economically reasonable so I guess a learned a lesson .. no more b&d products.
2,Just OK,"This is the 2nd GH1000 I've owned. The first one bit the dust like previous complaints, it stopped spinning. I bought a new one and turned in the old one. 2nd one is better, but I'm constantly changing spools. I go through about 4-5 when I'm edging the lawn, and that's only in the front! It's not much fun troubleshooting or changing spools. I'm pretty sure my neighbors see my frustration and won't be buying any B&D products. Also, the cutter/plastic protector is broken, I'll be checking for reviews on another product shortly. The only pro about this is the amount of torque these deliver."
1,Continued Problems,"This product still has feed problems. In an hour and a half i spent at least half of the time taking the trimmer head apart. Stuck cord, cord broken off inside, etc. AND it feeds new cord every time to hit the on switch - so it used up a whole spool in one outing. So figure on buying $10 worth of cord for every use. This thing is crap. My old Weedeater (tap and go cord feed) worked for 7 years flawlessly - i finally broke the plastic handle. I'm now going to glue it back together and see if i can get home depot to take the black and decker back:)"
1,String feeder!!,"I bought this product and used it twice then returned it. I was so excited about it because it swivels, its light, and it has great power for an electric trimmer. I got it home tore into my lawn and the spool jammed. I had to take it apart and refeed it. Then it jammed again. I took it apart again. Then is just kept feeding and I ran out of line.....one use. I gave it a second chance because I really like the other positives. I installed a new line and went to work....this time string just kept coming....and coming....and coming. I had 12inch pieces of neon green string all over my yard. Surprise....I ran out before I was finished. The next day I returned it. Oh yeah, I got wacked about 10 times when the string was flying everywhere."
1,Piece of crap,"Who makes a trimmer with a plastic gear placed less than an inch from a motor that gets as hot as an oven when in use? If they ran this thing in testing for more than 30 minutes, they would have seen that it melts right through the gear and belt. What a joke. If only you could give something a zero. I'll never buy something from Black and Decker again."
4,so far so good,"Trimmer works well. It's bigger than I thought, but pretty light. The only real complaint is the instruction sheet. Not very easy to understand. There is an arm that comes down for edging, but the instructions on it are very poor. Also when it came time to put new line on the spool, the instructions were very vague. Those can be overcome, and it seems to work well, but the instructions are frustrating."
1,Review on Grass Trimmer,This is exactly for I was looking for. All I had to do was buy an extension cord for it.
1,Terrible...Find another brand,"The first time I used it one of the screws holding the plastic guard backed out and ruined the guard. Been waiting for replacement part 2 months now and no end in sight. Have written Black & Decker and no response at all.I also have had the bottom spin off multiple times. Also, if the line gets in between the plastic hub and the spool, it ruins the hub and the line gets jammed continously. Absolutely frustrating all on counts. This is the worse product and service I have ever encountered. You live and you learn."
1,Same problem like everyone else,"I purchased this trimmer last month and it worked great the first time, but I used it again and the cap just flew off, and it continued, so I took it back and got another one and the new one didn't last 1 turn and the same thing happened. Plus the cord lock is to small and like everyone else I keep getting unplugged. I called black and decker to log a complaint and highly suggested they take it off the market before someone gets hurt."
2,Lots of Power but Poorly Designed,"Used this for a very small patch of grass in the backyard for a few years. Like many other reviewers, the plastic gear that drives the trimmer shaft eventually melted. It cannot be replaced without replacing the entire motor, which costs as much as the unit does new. I appreciated the power of this electric trimmer but ultimately this cheap plastic component rendered it completely useless!"
1,Didn't even last one season,"Avoid this one, it's a piece of junk. I got this for light-duty yard work like edging and weeds. I didn't even get one full season out of it before it died while edging my tiny lawn. The motor spins, but the head doesn't turn. In reading reviews it seems like a common problem.However, even before it died it was far from perfect. When it gets hold of even a small amount of material (like when doing routine edging of a lawn) it bites in and drags way too much string out of the automatic feeder. It wastes A LOT of string that way.I'm in the market for a new string-trimmer. I won't be looking at Black & Decker models."
1,Don't Buy This Trimmer,"Don't buy the GH 1000, or any other trimmer that feeds the line automatically. The line either feeds too much or too little. This happens when using factory wound spools. The first GH 1000 I bought was replaced by B & D when the unit quit working. The replacement runs OK, but the line feed is a joke. I am trying to find a universal head for this trimmer but all that I find in stores specifically state on the package that it will not fit a GH 1000. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON A GH 1000 !!!"
1,Do Not Buy This Trimmer,"After using this product less than one dozen times, it stopped working. I took it apart (after discovering the ""hidden screw"") to find that a cheap plastic drive gear had warn/melted. But, in trying to buy a replacement, found that the gear must be purchased as part of the ""Motor Assembly"", for over $52.00 (not counting shipping)!This design is an insult to consumers, hiding a cheap part that will fail, forcing the replacement of the entire unit. It makes one wonder when Black and Decker will begin hiring people with engineering degrees to advise them on the desirability of selling products that look good but are designed to fail far before they produce their expected value!A One Star rating is a gift!!"
1,broke quickly,"had it about a year, it was fine the first 4 times I used it but today (probably use#5--it's not heavily used) the engine turns but the string doesn't. I'm going to replace this with a gas powered one. This one was OK power wise but it shouldn't break so quickly..."
1,the trimmer part is the worst....,"I've had the Black & Decker Grass Hog XP GH1000 for two years, and for two years I've been frustrated. The trimmer spool design is horrible. (mine is not on the recall list) At first, I thought it was just me and dealing with a different type of spool, but in reality it is just the spool. Entire chunks of the green trimmer string unwind and break off, which makes it run out faster. Also, when you purchase a new spool and open it, it completely unwinds into a mess. Attempting to re-wind the trimmer string is impossible because it gets tangled and, therefore, useless. Other than the spool, the rest of the machine works fine, but unfortunately without a spool, it's just an expensive, hand-held motor."
1,Belt/Pulley failure,"This item has a design flaw as all these 1 star reviews point out. I have had this trimmer for less than a year and while I was using it for the first time since the fall the string head stopped rotating but the motor kept going. Being an engineer I take everything apart, so I found out that the belt had broken and the pulley had melted. Would a metal pulley really cost that much more? This is one of the most expensive corded trimmers and at the time that I got it the reviews were a little more positive and it had also gotten favorable reviews from consumer reports. I guess they just don't make things to last. Everything else about the trimmer is fine. The reason they don't sell replacement pulleys is because the pulley and the bearings are press fit on the shaft and therefore it is not something the average homeowner will be able to replace."
1,Plastic drive pulley melted - now useless,"I purchased this item in the spring of 2008 for $70. I used it very little over two seasons, so little in fact that I never added new string. It now has a melted plastic drive pulley. Because this pulley is part of the motor assembly it cannot be replaced without replacing the whole motor. Making a critical part of the drive assembly out of cheap plastic was a terrible design flaw that makes this product a disposable item. DO NOT BUY IT."
1,Grass Hog is plastic junk,I gave this an early favorable review ... the quality of this product has forced me to reverse course 100%.It initially seemed to work ... we had two of them ... after about 3 reloads the minute either one encountered any thick vegetation the string would feed out almost constantly ... and we used the right string. Then each one broke ... a small piece of plastic on the ratchet mechanism on one and the grass shield cracked and literally fell off the other.These are total junk ... if you want a good electric weed eater get the one that is made by Stihl.Stihl also makes a 4 cycle ... mid-range size ... gas powered weed eater which handles just about anything and is easy to use ... be sure to get it with the larger accessory guard to keep stuff from coming back at you.As for the Grass Hog ... it's garbage.
5,Old Problems Must Be Gone,"The low ratings on this product must have been solved by the recall and subsequent manufacturing, because we're very impressed with this product. Our neighbor is also happy with his. We had a gas trimmer previously, and this has every bit as much power. Plus, the larger guard keeps it from spitting the weeds back at you. It's lightweight and easy enough for a 73 year old woman to handle, yet strong enough to quickly take down pretty high, damp grasses."
1,Disposable by design,"I'm not sure what convinced me to buy another Black & Decker tool. I knew they were junk. Maybe my kids were distracting me at the store and I just wanted to get out in a hurry. Anyway, it worked a few times, but pretty quickly, the hub stopped engaging, although the motor would still spin. I took it apart and there is a rubber belt that attaches to a plastic gear (that's right - plastic). The belt had shredded and melted the plastic gear. It looks like quite a few other reviewers have had the same problem. These parts stood no chance of lasting under any kind of use. I'm off to hunt for the receipt. Black and Decker should give up on tools and stick to home improvement books."
1,Do Not Buy!,"Do what I did after the spool hub cap flew across the yard after only 20 min. of use, file a complaint with the Consumer Product Safety Commission online. The CPSC are coming to get this trimmer from hell today! A small price to pay if they force a recall!Black and Decker ""help line"" is useless, told to return to retailer! The person at the other end of the line has probably never seen a blade of grass, much less a string trimmer! They were not interested in the safety issue of flying hub caps across the yard at a high rate of speed!Never again will I buy B&D; products!"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,It works great for about 10-20 minutes then it falls apart... literally. As many of the other posts have said the spool feeds too fast then flies off. Lesson learned... Read reviews of products before purchasing if at all possible. Unfortunately you can't always trust in a good brand.
1,absolutely worthless,The worst purchase of my life. Automatic feed? Up yours Black and Decker. Only enjoyment this product brought was smashing it to bits. Will never even touch a Black and Decker product again.
2,It stopped working after a couple of uses,I brought this trimmer about 2 years ago and used it maybe 6 times. Today after around 20 minutes it broke down. The motor runs but the trimmer/string will not spin. And the line if half full. It did a good job when it was working but judging from the other reviewers it doesn't seem to last long.
1,REVIEW FOR CURRENT MODEL,"I will admit, I live in the middle of nowhere and I should have bought a commercial grade weedeater, but I was tired of fighting the gas powered weedeaters I was used to.The auto-feed mechanism died about an hour into the life of the device and twenty minutes into the second season of ownership, the motor spins but the cutting head doesn't. I decided to leave a review after looking online to figure out how to repair this weedeater only to learn that all the internals are junky plastic.On the upside, the spool never fell off while I was weedeating!"
1,Junk Automatic Feed Does Not Work,"Just to echo other reviews, automatic feeder does not work. Spend more time fixing string (factory wound bought new) than trimming lawn. This goes to Goodwill and will be replaced. What absolute junk."
2,too much self feed,I just bought this item and already have problems. The self feed does not know when to stop. It went through all of the line before I was done with half of the yard.
1,Garbage,I purchased this on Amazon a few years ago. It lasted two and a half years before the cheap rubber drive broke inside. I tried to fix it once and it was no use. What a piece of junk. There was even a recall on the string holder and that was nothing compared to the other problems I've had with it.
1,"Confirmed, a real piece of junk",Just want to confirm what others have indicated. Was using the trimmer today when it died. The motor runs but will not drive the head anymore. It has been used maybe a dozen times in a very small yard.
1,Avoid this Junker,"No Stars. I bought this thing a year ago and used it only three times for a small yard. I liked the fact that you didn't need to keep bumping the trimmer wheel on the ground to get more line. HOWEVER. During the third use, the trimmer wheel quit working. The motor spins, but the drive doesn't. Now apparently I will have to try to fix it my self, as the warranty is up. It did get a little warm on the housing, but not so much as to cause concern. Now I'm stuck with no trimmer and I will avoid Black & Decker products in the future. Big disappointment."
1,Motor gear melts,"We have used it for a while - it was not the best tool but OK. However, now it failed completely. I opened it: the gear is plastic made and was completely burned/melted (together with the belt). Replacement parts cost ~70$ and my guess it would melt as well."
1,Melted in 15 minutes,"Plastic gears inside melted instantly, and are not-replaceable. see other reviews on the is issue. just adding my 1 star to the list. Stay away."
1,Waste of my money,"I've had the same problem everybody is complaining about: after 2 months of very light use, the motor is still running but the spool does not. It is a waste of money."
4,The first trimmer I've kept,"I hate weed whackers aka trimmers. I have only had problems with them whether it be starting the thing (gas) or re stringing and changing the string 3 minutes into using it. I was very leery about getting another one but I wasn't ready to pay someone to do my lawn quite yet without another go. I must say, I am impressed. For the first time I was able to use it without any hassle at all. I had zero problems with the string, it of course started right away with it being electric, and was light and easily maneuverable for me (woman). Today is day one, and have not had a go at the grass along the fence, but today was a change in itself! I will make amendments to this review if need be (this weekend), hence the 4 out of 5 stars. I recommend this product!"
5,This must be the newer model,"I love this trimmer. Looking at reviews, I must have the fixed version. Strong. No gas mess. Easy start (just pull the trigger). Easy to load string and I get lots of run time, multiple sessions per load (1/3 acre, front and back several times, using it for both trimming and edging). I'll buy a spare spool for easy load in case I run out mid-trim. And the best part? I use the energy I've produced with my solar system!"
1,Almost a great trimmer... but NOT,"As the other reviews say, everything about this trimmer is good except for the poor design of the head. I used mine for about an hour before taking it back to the store. The ""line hub cap"" flew off FIVE times! I had to rewind the string twice. 3 of the 5 times the cap flew off it was a projectile - hitting me in the leg twice, and the neighbor's house once. After getting hit in the leg for a second time, that was it. I was frustrated and knew this thing was dangerous."
1,NOT A CHANCE IN H______.,I'm glad I dident use it after buying it. I was going to put the gator multi fit blads on and well ya guessed it they did'ent fit.I looked at the workings of the unit read the reviews for it and I know I should of done that first but it looked and read like a great tool to use.And after looking at the parts they seem so thin it couldent hold up to the task at hand.Its sorry to hear others haveing trouble.but thats how we all learn.thks.
2,Motor assembly,"I have the orange cap, but the motor assembly where the belt attaches opposite the drive pulley is plastic and the belt just fried to the assembly and that part is part of the motor assembly and cannot be purchased seperately. whole motor assembbly has to be replaced @$60.20, plus belt, plus shipping is the cost of a new one. Line assembly was not the only issue....It is going to the curb and I will buy something else...."
2,Powerful but short lived,This is a powerful electric trimmer but mine did not last long -- less than 6 hrs of use. The head stopped rotating so took it apart and the belt that transfers power from motor to head shaft had broken plus the plastic gear teeth stripped so not really worth it to repair. It did really consume string as well. It is out of warranty.This is the second B&D; product that died an early death. I plan to get a Stihl.
1,Breaks right aways - don't buy!,"My previous B&D; bought the farm yesterday when a small plastic piece in the line feed mechanism broke. I bought the grass hog XP hoping for more power and better reliability.Right out of the box, the shaft was loose connected to the motor end. Within an hour, the trimmer head stopped rotating while the motor spun. There's no user servicable parts, so back to Lowes it goes. I noticed that Lowes hasn't restocked this item on their shelves. They've probably had enough of the returns and are discontinuing the model."
1,This Thing is a Menace,"I am not one to raise a ruckus, but this thing is an abomination. The dual-line spool hurls itself and its cap like a hockey puck every five minutes, requiring an Easter egg hunt and dual respooling. Fun! Careful, though, when ya go to deal with this, cuz the business end gets so hot, you could burn yourself touching nearly a foot up the shaft.Today was my third stab at using the muther: after two de-spoolings it got creative and the protective cover vibrated off, which allowed it instantly auto-feed out an extra two feet of line and slash at my ankle. And so tonight, bloody and bowed, I brought it back and replaced it with a Troy-Bilt.What's funny is, it was still sorta hard to do, cuz this thing is beautifully balanced, a pleasure to the hand and the eye, and cuts like a maniac. But depending on it is sorta like hiring Ted Bundy as your gardener. A true shame."
1,DANGER WILL ROBINSON,"Dont even think about buying this item I was lucky enough to be able to take it back and get a refund after using it once Wish I had read these reviews before I bought it, would have saved me a return trip to Home Depot. It ate my extension cord, first trimmer to actually cut thru the extension cord BEWARE of this product"
