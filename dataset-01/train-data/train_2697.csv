5,The best of its type,"At the end of the century it is wonderful to be able to look back and marvel at our most recent history, and what better way to do it than with these magnificent pictures. We are fortunate indeed that our history can be recorded in this way.This is not the sort of book to leave on a shelf. Leave it on a coffee table, on a sofa, or on a chair where it will be picked up and looked at with regularity. It's not only educational - there are memories in there for all of us. And being a Life book, they are the best pictures of all."
5,Canadian Summer,"Canadian Summer is about the Mitchells' first, well, Canadian Summer. They rent a cabin, go exploring, fall off a boat, go exploring, meet the Jolicoers, go exploring, meet Mr. Magic, go exploring, get lost, go exploring, lose their dog, go exploring, help Peter with his wounded leg, go exploring, stop a forest fire, go exploring, throw a party, go exploring, get a new house, go exploring, and did I forget to mention that they went exploring?"
1,Disappointed,"I have the regular Avent bottles and I like them. I've been using them since my daughter was born 11 months ago. We are going on a trip and I thought Avent would be the best for disposable bottles. I found two big problems:1. The bottle leaks. I've tried everything and it still leaks. Maybe I'm missing something here because I haven't heard anybody on Amazon having this problem???2. You still need to measure the water or milk in another container because the plastic lining is not accurate. It even says so on the instructions. I think this is a big drawback if you are travelling because you still need to carry a regular bottle to measure the amounts. But I guess this second problem is going to be found in any disposable bottle.Overall I'm disappointed and I'm returning this product, mainly due to problem number 1. It simply doesn't work."
2,I loved them at first . . .,these bottles were great i thought but i have found they leak. i have 5 of these bottles so i know its no just mine. and i know that i am putting the top on right. its very hard to feed a 2 week old in the middle of the night when she gets more on her then in her mouth. i really bought these to be used with the avent pump which i love but it makes me cry when i pump out 5 ozs and she only gets less then 3.
2,Hard to use,I had high hopes for Avent bottles since I'm also breastfeeding and everyone swore they were the best. But the reusable bottles were just too hard to use. The bottom piece makes it nearly impossible to warm the bottle in hot water and forget about trying to push the air out of the bag. I just took them out. In the end I found that my baby took in a lot of air - I think it's just not the right nipple shape for him. Now they're just sitting in the cupboard and we've moved on the Dr. Brown's which are working great.
1,a waste of money!,"I purchased 6 Avent disposable bottles, liners, and Avent on the Go Pump, and Avent Express sterilizer before having my daughter because I heard Avent is the best. I had to introduce my daughter to bottles when she was 3 weeks old because I had to get her used to it for the babysitter. I was dissappointed to find out that the hole in the nipple is too large on the slowest flow nipples. She would drench her face & bib trying to eat and would choke at every feeding. I then tried Playtex nursers and we no longer have that problem. Avent bottles are a waste of money and practically drowned my daughter!"
2,Completely superficial,"The Trial is not meant to be summed or better understood through someone else's interpretation, because there is no conclusion one couldn't arrive at if he or she simply allowed themselves to be enveloped by Kafka's simple matter of fact prose. Using cliff notes for The Trial would be like watching the movie version of the old man and the sea; you get the point, but you don't get the experience. And if one cannot even brave as simple a task as The Trial, maybe he or she should be looking elsewhere, because Kafka deserves better than some lazy college student rushing to pump out another perfunctory piece of trash masquerading as an analysis."
1,shallow and simplistic,"What a disappointment! This book reminds me of a child's illustrated reader--it is definitely not for educated adults. The concepts are treated so briefly, and the illustrations are so large and glossy, that there is little chance of gaining insight or illumination on any topic. The publisher promised ""provocative,"" but the provocation, sadly, is caused by the author's heavy-handed ideological slant that favors opinion over fact. The institution of ""marriage,"" for example, is deemed out-of-date, and to illustrate that fact, we are treated to a nice, big, glossy photo of Michael Douglas and Katherine Zeta-Jones with a caption describing their need for a pre-nuptial agreement. Puleeze!"
4,Enlightening and Fun Read.,"This book focuses on ideas thought to be important or pivotal to the development of history and humans. It's a somewhat cursory examination which is both a blessing and a burden. A blessing from the aspect that you don't get bogged down on one idea for a long period of time and also a burden because sometimes certain ideas interest you to the point where you want to read more about them. The book contains many nice illustrations and captions which tend to liven the subject and make it more alluring. The breadth and scope of ideas covered is another nice feature, however, some ideas (such as those on fascism and national superiority) tend to be overlapping and can become tedious. All-in-all though I would recommend it as a good refresher book or something suitable to get your thinking cap on."
3,Brackets are of poor design,"The bar itself is great, very sturdy. The brackets, however, could be better. First, as mentioned in another review, they are too wide for most doorways, so it may be difficult getting the 3rd screw in.More importantly is the poor design of the latches on the brackets. One of the 2 latches will not properly keep the bar end in the bracket, due to the loose fit of the bar in the bracket. My 11 year old son, who needs to jump up to use the bar, has to be very careful to not unlatch the bar from the bracket.The loose fit means it rattles as used, leaving a poor impression of overall quality.Finally, the brackets look ""industrial"" - ie, rather sloppy. They are not nicely finished and do not add an attractive appearance to my son's bedroom doorway.I will try to rework the brackets a little to result in a better fit of the bar. Hopefully the looseness can be corrected."
2,Cheaply made,"I would not buy this product again. Quality is poor. Forget about using the srews that are provided. I used some 2.5"" wood screws instead. Bar has some play when inserted in the slotted groves of the brackets. This is a problem especially when your trying to work through a vigerous set of chin-ups. My wife at 127lbs reached up to grab the bar and one of the brackets bent! I was able to pound it back into shape with a hammer, but wow! Poor quality! For the money I'd purchase another brand. Especially since they all run about the same price."
2,Poor bracket design,"The brackets holding the bar are poorly designed. There are small curved metal pieces that are supposed to stop the bar from coming up and out, but they are unreliable and can fail to lock, or can flip up and let the bar out at the worst moment. If you only do pull-ups and are careful not to push the bar up, it may be OK, but if you have kids, then you better hold the bar while they are using it, so that you can catch it when it falls out of the brackets.Mounting the brackets to the wall is also something they gave no thought to. There are screws but no instructions. The brackets are too wide for our door molding. If you put the bar between walls in a hallway (like I had to do), then screws are definitely not enough, you need to use drywall anchors. But given the design of the brackets, I can't recommend this bar anyway."
4,pull.....up......,"hey, this is the only way to get your 20 pull ups in the PFT marines!!! Do 5 every time you walk under the bar and a few max sets a day and you should be up to 20 in no more than 6 weeks....unless your a fat body! then you need to go run! Also this fit my 40"" doorway fine, It should fit up to 46"" door easy I only wish the grips were moveable. Until net time.....Stay motivated!!"
4,sturdy and widely adjustable,"I wish it didnit' ahve to be screwed in, but it is sturdy, so i guess its worth it."
4,Box too big.,"The pull up bar came fine and was what was expected. Easy to put up and good price. Our only real drawback was that for some reason it is shipped in a HUMONGOUS box. Seriously, the pull up bar is like 2feet long (before extending) and only a few inches thick but it came in a box around 5ft tall and 3 feet square. Seems like a waste of cardboard."
4,Sturdy Bar,A very sturdy bar.. Excellent for balance when doing squats. I haven't tried it with full body weight yet..
5,Love it!,"Very good quality, feels solid in your hand. I dropped it already a few times and it didn't break. What else can I say?"
4,How Not to Get Sick,"This is a fascinating book about how by following Biblical principles, people can avoid many of the diseaes of modern mankind. So many illnesses are avoidable if people would only avoid doing what causes them in the first place. Even though this book was written well over 50 years ago, it is as relavant today as it was then."
3,Keyboard with mouse,"This is a great price for this combination item. The mouse works great and so does the keyboard. The one thing not mentioned in the item description is the mouse has a USB cord only 36 inches long, so it is completely useless unless you have sitting right beside of the keyboard. The keyboard has a USB inlet."
5,The BEST Physio book that exists.,"I highly recommend this book to any medical student. It's easy to read and understand, and very complete. Some of my friends used the Costanzo physio book, but this book is much more complete and has color photos and clinical cases at the end of each chapter. Besides, Costanzo is just a more complete version of BRS Physio and it doesn't really add anything. This physio book really helps explain some of the key concepts in detail and its the most complete reference book you can find. I don't see how you can survive your 2nd year of medical school without this book. And my Step 1 exam had a TON of physio questions, so I'm really glad I studied physio in detail."
5,TO ONE OF THE BEST NBA STARS IN HISTORY. I LOVE YOU,"WHATZ UP TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN, I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGSTO SAY TO/ABOUT ALLEN IVERSON. I LOVE YOU AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."
3,Acoustic Stories,"Joe Sun has long been a teller of stories, but usually in band setting. This is just him and his guitar. I still love his voice and songwriting, but I've never been big on the artist-and-guitar thing ~ it can start to sound repetitive. I like the variety, the ebb and flow of 4 or 5 instruments backing and supporting a singer.Still, finding any Joe Sun,long after his Ovation years, is a treat -- especially for the download price. His imports (with shipping) are too pricey for me, if available at all.bIGhIG"
2,Altec Lansing Headphones,More for a woman. I truely am afraid I will break them. They just don't seem to be of hogh quality. I'm disappointed.
5,Solid quality,"This device is used to plug in to a 50 A station if your RV has a 30 A power cord. There are 5 or 6 different types of adaptor cables, so be sure you're getting the right one.The male end of this device plugs in to a 50 A camp station outlet box, and you plug your RV power cord into the female end.If you have a long trailer or are often forced into the larger-RV camp sites, this is a must-have device."
4,happy with mocky,"good read. very diff. style of writing, but creatively done. endearing characters you will think about and relate to. a great first effort by the author."
2,Not a fan,"I was assigned this book in a modern literature class. While I thought the author had an original idea, I think the story left something to be desired. The child-spelling was cute for about three sentences and then quickly became annoying."
3,Some rare entries in collection,"This is a collection of nine of the ""Hollywood on Parade"" shorts, all complete, but not at all restored. The numbers of the shorts contained are A-1, A-3, A-4, A-5, two numbered A-6, A-12, B-1 and B-5. I'm not sure why there are two numbered A-6. The first A-6 has Richard Arlen performing as a magician and has (among others) Frances Dee, Clark Gable and Buster Keaton. The second A-6 has Shipwreck Kelly flagpole sitting with various young women who look through a telescope and sight stars such as Charlie Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Harold Lloyd, Charles Farrell, Johnny Weissmuller, Mary Pickford and others. Bing Crosby and Harry Langdon have actual parts in the short. Although some of these shorts are easy to find elsewhere, a few are more rare and it is an entertaining little collection."
3,fun in the 30's,This product was on time and in good condition. It was cool watching jean Harlow golfing and seeing what life was like back in the 30's at the studios.
2,Good Movie..Bad Transfer.,"So obviously if you are looking at this film titled ""Naked Massacre"" you have either seen it or enjoy copious amounts of nudity and massacres. Either way, I think you will enjoy the film. But As there are no other reviews and the title pretty much speaks for itself, I won't review the film itself. But its quality.It is a VHS transfer. There are times where the video shakes, and you can see tracking lines in the image. The actual clarity of the transfer isn't terrible. It is watchable, but I wish more information was given to let us know it was a VHS transfer. There are no special features at all. The sound quality is slightly hollow. This seems to be an ""official"" release. I just wish a better job was done on the transfer. If you can find it fairly cheap, I recommend it as its a decent exploitation flick. But more importantly, if you have a VCR, get the vhs. For you'll be getting about the same quality and VHS box art is always much better."
3,Richard Speck in Belfast,"Gritty and in some ways functioning on a level with Abel Ferrara's ""Driller Killer"". NM transplants Richard Speck's Chicago mass murder to Belfast during a turbulent war torn period in history. Even more disturbing is the director chose to make the antagonist a Viet vet and somewhat sympathetic in a ""Taxi Driver"" vein. Interesting idea not quite carried out to its fullest but nevertheless compelling. Psychological subtext seems at war with its own luridness. It would be interesting to see this film released through a company like Anchor Bay with some extras and a better transfer than whats floating around. A commentary track from the director would be nice too. Oh, and lose that title!"
3,Ciaras OK,"I like it, its growing on me...I think its waaayyy better than some of the other stuff I'm listenin too... Stay Ciara, grow OUT of aaliyah mode... but stay slim and sexy and the dark hair is gorgeous on you!"
2,"Nice Look, but Not So Good for Holding a Charge.","I learned a very valuable lesson when I bought this portable charger. Never buy something just because of the Name. Up until this point, I trusted the Motorola name. I purchased this thing hoping that I could rely on the ability to charge my phone when or if I needed to while on the go. When I received the thing, it would not completely charge. I had it plugged in for about 30 hours, and the light kept flashing ""charging,"" and never changing. I returned it for a replacement. I didn't have any problems getting a ""new"" one in its place, but it wasn't all that either. The initial charge was about 8 hours; normal I guess. Even after a ""full charge"" it would not completely charge anything. The charger went dead quickly. I would not recommend this product to anyone, except maybe a recycling company."
4,A continuous experience,Wow - put your headphones on and listen to this cd. there are a lot of subtle and intricate parts woven into this musical story. several musical influences to listen to and i really liked the vocals of the lead singer-story teller. great for listening to late at night.
1,Offensive,"I for one hate the song ""Love Child"" because I think it sends out a very bad message. Saying that a person is ""never meant to be"" is not only damaging; it is cruel and hurtful.On an impersonal level I understand that the girl of song story is saying she wants to wait prior to having a sexual relationship as she is not ready to take on the responsibility. Well and good. However, I take issue with the lyrics ""...before end up hating the child we may be be creating...Love Child! Never meant to be!"" Saying that suggests that only those born within marriages are valid people and meant to be.Humanity predates marriage, so there was a time when all people were conceived and born ex wedlock. I hate the song and find it very offensive."
4,Great protection,"I've been pleased with this screen guard. It connects @ the usb port of the PSP with 2 little screws that are included. I always have the pelican skin grip on my PSP, which offers decent protection of everything--except the screen. This leather screen cover fits on the PSP without having to take the skin grip off, which is perfect: the screen now is covered during PSP charging, traveling, etc...If you are going to do any heavy transporting of the PSP, I would recommend the logitech play gear case--but for everyday use, this leather screen cover is great when coupled with the skin grip.-MK-"
5,Amazing,"I have seen this movie twice in Poland and even the second time it was an amazing experience. It is about an imrisoned woman being interrogated by one of the political officers. It is a movie heavly embedded in the polish society during the era of communism. The relationship between the prisoner and the interrogator is slowly changing and it can be compared to the relationship between the kindapper and the kidnapped women. There is some brutality shown, but only enough to show the physical conditions of the prison system. I highly reccomand this movie."
1,Has 8 stars,"Compre esta bandera por que vi que era la de 7 estrellas (como sale en la figura) y me llego la de 8 estrellas.I bought this flag because I saw 7 stars in the flag's picture, and I received the flag with 8 stars."
3,Good Product,"I've only used this once, but it worked good. There's no temperature control. It's basically High=cook or Low=warm. Very easily to clean. If you want simple, this is it."
2,Lid is Not Manufactured Properly,"Didn't even plug the unit in. The lid is obviously not machined properly -- it's not wide enough -- resulting in a gap which will allow heat and steam to escape. I suspect this lid is used on several different models and ""pretty much"" fits them all.(The stoneware has four little grooves cut into its lip, which are designed to let out excessive steam. If the lid were about 1/4 inch wider, it would cover the pot nicely with the four little holes available for steam release.)The lid also seems a bit light in weight and doesn't sit perfectly flat on the lip of the pot. I can readily understand other reviewers' complaints about overflow and splatter. Sorry, I'm not willing to take a chance on this and will be returning it."
2,falling apart,"After about 3 years of light usage, the plastic handle on the side of the cooker (not the handle of the crock) is broken so severely that I cannot safely lift the cooker. It is literally about to break off of the cooker at any moment. The ceramic crock is cracked inside. The metal shell is thin and dents easily. This unit works, but you can anticipate the need to replace in a fairly short time. There is no "" keep warm"" setting, only a low setting, which is not that low."
4,Fantastic crock pot,"This slow cooker has been very good for my husband and I. It is the perfect size for most of my crock pot recipes and I like how the crock lifts out so I can set it right on the table when dinner is ready. Two settings is plenty and it is VERY easy to clean. My only complaint is the plastic knob is kind of cheap and cracked, I threw it away and just use the little post that sticks out. But that was after over 3 years of weekly use, definitely add one to your wedding/house warming wish list!"
3,handle broke off,"Hi. This product works great, but the cover slipped out of my hands into the sink, and though it didn't break, the handle broke off. No glue works on it, and crockpot no longer sells this lid as a replacement part. The silliest thing is that they don't sell the handle as a replacement part even though it's attached by a screw and so completely removable. The offered me a discount on a new pot, but that is so wasteful!"
1,Melting crockpot,The handles melted on first use. I was very disappointed and wondered if the thermostat was faulty. I'm now very afraid to use it. What would you recommend?
4,Mr,"Excelent slow cooker. Very pleased. Easy to set up, Ideal for 2 people,Even heat transfer to the insert.Insert easly broken. Care must be taken. Pleased it is dishwasher usable.Larry"
2,"Lid leaks, again!","This is the second Rival crock pot I've gotten and both had the same problem - there is a 1/8 inch gap between the lid and the ceramic base. This lets out a lot of steam during the slow-cook period, so the food can dry out and it is less efficient of our energy. It seems it wouldn't be much more effort for them to make a lid that actually fit the base without that gap!"
2,Works OK but cheap plastic handles,"This slow cooker works as advertised but the handles are incredibly cheaply made. Mine cracked after three uses. When I called customer service, they said that was just too bad."
4,Gift,"Borrowed an almost identical crockpot and chipped the insert while washing it. This replacement is .5 quarts bigger, but friend did not seem to mind."
5,Works just great.,"I prefer simple slow cookers. One that has off, low and high. Of course I never use the high. It's a slow cooker. The thing I like about this one is that it is a 3 1/2 quart size, and oval in shape. This means it can accept all kinds of meat in it. It did a great job as my photos illustrate, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a simple medium-size slow cooker. JMC"
2,review,Did not seem to heat up in the high mode. Appears to be a defective model. I would not recommend this item.
5,Cooks Well,"I've used this crock pot a few times now, it has cooked the meals with great results every time I have used it. The product feels of good quality when I pick it up and I feel like it will last a long time."
2,Boy was I fooled.,"Ordered this Crock-pot as it's advertised as being made by Rival, which is a made in the USA company. Well surprise, when I receive the item, it's made in CHINA!No mention of RIVAL anywhere in paperwork or on the Crock-pot as shown in the picture. Company on sticker is Sunbeam, which has apparently taken over RIVALand now manufactures the items in china.,,,,, very disappointed as I was trying to buy American made product.I'm not going to return it, as other reviews state it's a very reliable item, but I am disappointed in the way it is advertised."
2,cheap lids and handles,"Cheap, cheap, cheap constructions of the handles. I bought two of these, one for me and one for my Mother. I envisioned cooking up a meal in mine and swapping it out for my Mother's when I went to visit. When I opened the box one lid was loose. I tightened it with a Phillips screwdriver, and washed both pots and lids, as instructed. Now both the handles are loose, dishwater collects underneath them, and my Mother can't be bothered to pull out a Phillips screwdriver every time she washes the pot and lid. Wish I had never bought them."
2,Takes the 'slow' out of Slow cooking.,"If all you make in your crock is soups and stews, this would probably be fine for you. However, if you want a crock-pot you can get creative in or one you can leave on while you're at work this isn't the one for you. I made steel-cut oatmeal that should have cooked on low for 8-9 hours, it was done in 4.5! Since I was home it wasn't a big deal but I can't imagine what this would have looked like after 8 hours! It is usable if you are home with it, but if I had known how hot and fast this would cook I wouldn't have purchased it. That said, I do love the size and removable pot. I have not had issues with the lid as other people have mentioned, but mine is a good 6 or 7 years old now so it could be a newer issue."
3,single folks get a smaller one,I am a single fellow that has tried several recipes in this cooker. It is certainly straightforward and easy to clean but unless you are cooking something up that you intend on having a lunch and dinner leftover buy a smaller crockpot. It is bigger than I thought and cooks wierd if it's not full enough. Other than that it would be great if you're feeding four at a time.
1,not edible,"i found this product doing a search for ""edible gold leaf."" i decided to purchase after reading rave reviews about food items that were created using it. HOWEVER.. it is clearly marked ""NOT to be consumed"" and ""for decorative use only."" so this is a misleading product."
3,"PRETTY, BUT NOT EDIBLE! ???","I am new to the cake decorating business. I did a search for ""edible cake decor"". These popped up all over the place. When I received them, I saw bod print on the label saying NOT FOR CONSUMPTION& & DO NOT EAT. Now, I had to spend more money on 5 lbs of fondant, cake rounds & parchment paper so I could make a removable fondant top for the cakes to decorate."
2,Very small quantity,"The picture shows that plastic cube to be full of the product, but it is only about one third full, a very small amount."
5,Get the real answers of fuel injection,"This was one of my textbooks at Denver Automotive and Diesel College. Steve Hatch was my instructor in the course. Avoid yahoo stories like it is the bubonic plague when it comes to automotive. Especially yahoo answers or similar things on google. If you want to learn, buy it. I had an older edition of the book. The electrical does not change. A depletion zone of semi conductor is the same. What changes is when manufacturers go to different systems using the same fundamentals of electricity/electronics."
5,Fine tuned,"The writing evokes such a strong sense of place, time and character. The story builds up without rush, layer by layer, befitting the slower-paced Southern atmosphere--while at the same time, the characters' sense of their lives possibly passing them by, is developed. Of course, music plays a part in this story about a piano teacher. Like anticipating a coming crescendo in an exciting new piece of music, the various layers of the story-telling come together beautifully and don't disappoint."
4,"blonde wigs, luv hut, and one dead squirrel",This is a great summer read that tricks you into thinking it is more obvious than it really is. Anyone with an appreciation of southern nuance will love this book. The little details creep up on you and then you suddenly realize it is rich in subliminal character and context. It is interesting to see that the writer really taps into relationships wraped around the concept of a murder mystery. It's fun and the first scene with the dead squirrel totally cracked me up.
2,"Good review of the horrors of war, but....","Vogt ignores the fact that that Quantrill raid, while cruel, was in retaliation for atrocities committed by Union troops, who had incarcerated innocent women because of their relationship to members of Quantrill's band in a ramshackle warehouse that later collapsed and killed several of them (who were only teenage girls!). This and the stereotypical portrayal of Union soldiers as pure-hearted saviors and all Confederates as evil slaveholders (less than 10 percent of them were)prevents me from giving a better rating to this novel. Although the romance is moving, authors should study the Civil War before they try to write about it."
5,Black & White Sheltie water bottle,The picture is wonderful. It is very hard to fine just a black & white Sheltie picture. The water bottle is the right size.
3,The Wake Lock picked? Well...,"Burrell has written a truly remarkable book, no doubt about it. You don't see the riddles of Finnegans Wake solved this fast and easy every day. And yet. Burrell himself says this: ""Readers must approach the text with the resolute conviction that Joyce intended his basic level of narrative to be his own peculiar transcription of Genesis. If they seek, they'll find."" Burrell has found Adam, Eve, God and the snake on every page, he managaes to explain the entire opus almost line-by-line with his basic narrative. But it wont' work. Seek, and you'll find lots and lots of other possible basic plots. Yes, Genesis is one of the major motifs of FW. But no, it is not the *basic* motif, the underlying structure, the meaning of it all. It is a major achievement to explain FW by one simple structure, but that doesn't mean that it is the Truth."
1,not good at all!,"I recieved the glass canopy and when i opened the box, I found all the glass to be shattered. The box was not even marked ""fragile"" or ""glass"" inside. The glass was shipped in a box without any padding whatsoever. The company admitted inexperience in shipping glass items and did, however, give me a prompt refund."
3,a mixed bag,"This was my first FC2 book but as I am an experimental poet I wanted to approach it open mindedly. I was immediately disappointed with the first story, whose three simultaneous voices were more theoretical than pratical and seemed to be devoid of imagery or concrete anything. Then I really enjoyed a few of the things in this book -- the story of an addict and her lover, told in images, in fragments, in memories. A man's lost eye. Departure from the vernacular, but in a meaningful way. Then, once again, I find she is abstractin' around."
5,Makes you feel like dancing!,"This workout is so much fun. The choregraphy does take multiple attempts to master, but that's what keeps you interested. Don't get discouraged, do your best, hit rewind until you get it, and have a blast! I know I probably look like a fool, but I feel like a dancer!"
2,A Big Disappointment,This video was disappointing as it was very fast with little explanation of difficult moves. I have taken a lot of dance classes and found it frustrating to keep up with even after several viewings. Many of the moves are accomplished while turning repeatedly. The instructor is irritating at best as she giggles throughout and gives no information on proper alignment. The background dancers are bored.
4,Richard Harris segment,"Charlie Rose talks to the veteran actor Richard Harris about his part in the movie , ""Cry the Beloved Country"". Harris talks about his co- star James Earl Jones, and also about his admiration for Nelson Mandela. At some point in the interview Harris talks about Acting as Avocation, and about the real Vocation as 'living'. It is strange that Harris uses the past tense here. It may be that Harris already knows about the fatal illness which will take his life. He also does an amusing rating of Shakespearean actors as Charlie Rose reads the list out. Harris talks about those who are technical actors only , and do not bring real passion to their roles. He also speaks a bit about the British empire and how it persecuted the Irish.Charlie Rose is as usual understanding and appreciative. But there is somehow a hint of sadness in this interview with a character who so celebrated life."
2,Lady emmanuelle,"Lady Emmanuelle,would have been a good movie,but I was disappoited with the censors,they have cut 14 minutes from the original.And yet they claim its x rated..In Italy is for the fourteen years olds.Can someone please tell me where to get the original version,,,,So I can claim my money back for this version..Mario"
2,Could write songs from a deeper place ................,"All I can say is that people are very liberal with 5 star ratings. I think it's a 2. There is only one good track, one track that shows some passion. That track is Chicken Joe, written by Joe about his passion for fried chicken. And when you listen to it you'll know he really loves that stuff, because his playing is very classy and he shows a beautiful sense of rhythm in front of a great arrangement.But all the other songs, all but one written by Joe, are very uninvolving. They are so ordinary that not even guests Peter White and Rick Braun on the same song can give it a lift. He has a good voice but his singing is average. This is my only cd of his, so I don't know whether it is an anomaly, or typical. But at a one in ten track strike rate, I won't be buying any more unless someone can point me in the right direction."
3,Only good for some metals,I bought this cloth to polish my gold up. It actually made my gold look dull. It did however make a silver necklace my boyfriend had look BRAND new. And his silver earrings too. I just wouldn't recommend it for gold.
5,It's Like Magic!,"I was skeptical about this taking the tarnish off my silver, thinking how can a simple cloth take off what seemed to look permanent, without damaging it? But I'm VERY impressed with it and how quickly it came off and made my silver look brand new! I took pictures and sent them to my sister who had seen the tarnish a few days before. She was amazed that it was the same piece of jewelry. I couldn't be happier with this product AND the price for that matter! For the miracle it seemed to work on my silver I would have thought I had to pay an arm or a leg for. I would recommend this to everyone that has any tarnished silver, you will be amazed!The only downside to this is it didn't work on my necklace like it did on my rings. It took some of the tarnish off, but after a day of wearing it, I had a little green tint around my neck again. Nonetheless, I will be buying more of these cloths!"
2,There are better ones,"Due to its small size, the cloth is relatively good at cleaning a few small items, i.e. spoons and the like. Ok for lightly tarnished small items when done with lots of rubbing. Yet, it very quickly absorbs the tarnish and is not longer effective. (And, yes, the tarnish does get on your hands.) I suggest spending a bit more and getting a larger size. Regardless of product claims, once these cloths gets 'goopy', give 'em up."
2,Average,Gets the silver clean with elbow greese and your hands black. I tried wearing gloves but they made my hands sweaty and uncomfortable. I probably would try another product next time.
4,Does the job!,"This polishing cloth is actually 5x7 and not 5x8 as stated in the description. It doesn't really make that much of a difference.....All in all, the cloth did a great job cleaning a 10k gold ring I had. It is now sparkly and looks new. It is really easy to use....a no brainer. Just rub the ring or whatever across the cloth and wallah! Just be aware that your fingers will get black when you do this. I would buy another if I needed to."
5,Fantastic,"I clean my engagement and wedding rings about once a week, and I was SHOCKED at all the crud that came off when I used this. My rings haven't looked so clean and shiny since my husband proposed. Also, it seems to have buffed out a few of the smaller scratches. Love this, would definitely buy again."
4,The Sunshine cloth,"I really like the Sunshine cloth because you can see all the dirt that is coming off what you are cleaning. I use it on my clarinet, and literally, after one use, it goes from old to new! The package didn't have any information about what to do when the cloth is completely dirty and black. The main thing I DO NOT like about this product is that you cannot wash it and have the ability to use it again. Once is once."
3,Decent learning tool.,"This CD is easy to use with several varied options for study techniques. FYI - you can download this learning program for FREE from the icanspeakfrench website. The free download AND this CD course has limitations. However, you can also purchase the full version (prompted on CD) from the product website. I wouldn't buy this again - I'd download for free or buy the full version."
5,A Very Good for Hispnic Teens,As a librarian I am always looking for books for Lation Kids. The short stories in this book are fun. Great characters and plots. Latino teens will enjoy reading this particular book!!!
3,Boring,I had to skim large sections of this book. It was very slow. The second half is better than the first but still not great.
1,needs moisture proof liner,"This brief does absorb; the challenge with itis that it has no water / liquid proof liner to keep the moisture from transferring to clothing, furniture and or bedding.I would not purchase it again."
3,Not sure what to think,"I purchased these for my parents for a present, however for some weird reason they are unable to cut through a double layer plastic bag (the soft type plastic bag). I have to use a normal cheapo scissors and it will cut through that same bag with no problem.These shears don't appear to be dull, I'm not sure why it isn't able to cut through a double layer plastic. Maybe the pair we got is just defective or something.I like the fact that it seperates in two parts if you want, so you can wash/clean it better."
1,Quality not so good,"This hat was not quite what I expected. I noticed that when I put it on it did not look right. The top portion was too soft, and kind of ""mushroomed"" out when I put it on my head, making it kind of silly looking. I returned it. At least that was easy."
3,ok cap,This cap is ok. The price is great.I don't like how the front is attached to the rest of the cap. I will look for a different model.
2,retro,"typical story of a girl with a crush on her father and her jealousy toward the woman in his life.she wanted him to bed her but he being a good ,straight laced father ignored her advances and she started having sex with women,including her fathers girlfriend"
1,Daddy Darling,The DVD is terrible quality. There are lines and flakes through the entire DVD. Would not recommend this video at all.
5,pump,"Pump works great, easy to install. Would absolutely recommend it for the money. Received it quickly and my husband has nothing bad to say about it."
3,Meh,"I give this one a 2.5, which is halfway. It isnt incredible, it isnt the worst thing I've ever heard. Its ok. There isnt anything origional, and thats ok. THey still help define the genre, somewhat. His screaming can sound incredibly forced at times, breaking up and crackling. Not attractive when you sound like a cat. Ive seen them a few times, and enjoyed their performances alot more than their cd. His singing can be fairly well, he can hit some decent notes. This isnt a waste of money if you buy it, but then again, it isnt a goldmine either."
2,Nothing special,"Silverstein isn't really that great. When i first put the cd into my cd player it started off strong. The first song is full of energy, it's a very good song in my opinion. Then until song 6 all of the songs slow down, its a real mood killer. After song 6 there are a few pretty good songs, in my opinion there just isnt enough to make me want to listen to this cd over and over again, i'd suggest you burn this from a friend instead of wasting your money on it. There's better stuff out there"
4,Canadian quartet stretch post-hardcore's boundaries,"Taking Back Sunday's ""Tell All Your Friends"" is the fastest-selling album in the history of Victory Records. Continued critical acclaim of Thursday's angular catharsis proves there's further cause to champion the light to the menacing shade of Hatebreed et al, all provided by the Chicago hardcore stable.Add Silverstein to that list. Like Thursday with, well, a set of balls, ""When Broken Is Easily Fixed"" is a justifiably confident debut, stitching driving post-hardcore to more straightforward bouts of melody-making with a dexterous, gut-wrenching performance from vocalist and driving force Shane Told, epitomised when he manages to make lyrics like ""My heart bleeds no more/Now it's been turned to stone"" sound like a true confessional.They deserve to make it big. The best part is they probably will."
1,Stay broken...you have no replay value...,"My friend called me one night and was screaming at me about how much he fell in love with this CD by Silverstein called ""When Broken Is Easily Fixed"". Well, I usually listen to him because he is into the same stuff I am, and we are both big fans of Victory Records. Well, at first listen, I really, really liked the CD. After listening to the CD religiously for 3 days, I fell out of love with it. Yes, it is very catchy at first, but it has no replay value at all. I thought it was just me, but I called my friend and asked him if he still was listening to Silverstein, and he told me that he sold it to some kid. This isn't Silverstein's fault, but the producers. Silverstein is a very talented band with a very good vocalist, and Ill make sure I listen to their new CD (if it ever comes out) instead of buying it...Stand Out Track - My Heart Bleeds No MoreI recommend: Atreyu - ""The Curse"""
1,silverstein when broken is easily fixed .....disapointment,"I did not receive the quality of product I was led to believe i would receive. The outside casing, inside casing and cd itself where covered in labels, stickers and metal security strips.I was not able to remove these without ripping the album artwork replacing the cd casing and leaving the cd with a sticky residue. I'm very disappointed."
4,"If you like Story of the Year, this band is for you","I found out about this band when i bought Taking Back Sunday's record ""Tell All Your Friends."" Inside was a Vicotry Records Sampler Cd. There were four songs from four different bands, and while all were good this is the one that really stook out. My Favorite band is Story of the YEar (SOTY), and whn i first heard this song i thought it was a Stoy of the year playing. I'm going to buy this cd as it has a sound resembling SOTY, but from the music samples i can tell its not as good, but it's still hecka cool."
3,"Good music, bad screaming.","I like listening to all kinds of music and figured if my son listened to this it is bound to be good right? Well the music I really enjoyed but the screaming and yelling and cussing! Whew! Too bad. This bunch sounds like they have some good tunes but all that hollering can give a guy a headache. I like the album cover. Guys, you`re good. You don`t have to YELL."
1,ehhh...,"i heard this cd and i realized that the most generic sceamo was made... this is awful,the music isnt good but man the lyrics are totally awful. victory needs to go back and sign the good bands that once ruled their label and get rid of generic trash like this.."
1,SUCKY.,"i never recieved my cd, and i messaged them and they said i'd get a full refund, but i never did get that either. wouldnt recommend this vendor!!"
1,Should Have Left Broken,In all honesty it was hard to hear the music with all of my booing. BOOOOOOO!!!!! This band sucks.
2,I'm gonna be honest.,"This cd isn't what I expected. I thought it was going to kick some ass and that the singles were just misleading because it was to get the mainstream people interested. WRONG! This cd can be worth a spin in your player if you're into this type of thing. The singer is the downfall of this band. The lyrics are so BLAND! I mean: ""You never made me happy"" in the MOST annoying tone of voice. The music is great: the driving to pounding guitars to the smashing drums and bass, but the singer throws it all off. The difference between this band and Boys Night Out and Grade etc. is that those bands were GOOD at the whole scream/sing thing and it wasn't quite ""emo"". This is straight up whiny. I think this is proof that hardcore and emo can't mix. I like the sound; just not the voice. I'd rather be listening to this than Limp Bizkit's new album though."
4,good; greatness is ahead,"This is a really good album whoever said it was released last year as Silence In Black and White was an idiot this was released almost a year before Hawthorne Heights first full length. I really enjoy this cdSmashed into pieces: 10/10 ""I'll slit my throat with the knife I took out of my spine""Red light pledge: 10/10 ""Promise me you will be there until the red light will change. I would wait forever""Giving up: 10/10 ""Velvet walls surround my sorrow""November: 9/10 ""I can see it in your eyes. You're broken down; your hands are tied""Last days of summer: 8/10 ""This gaping hole in my chest is filled with deceit""Bleeds no more: 9/10 ""Your stomach feels sick for someone else""Hear me out: 8/10 ""Now that you left. Make me feel like I'm gone""The weak and the wounded: 9/10 ""Struggle till the end. I scare myself""Wish I could forget you: 7/10 ""Its getting too late and its time to move on""When broken is easily fixed: 10/10 ""Emotion conquers my soul robs me of myself"""
1,Absolute value of -1 star is the same,"Listening to this band makes me want to punch the record executive that got drunk at a local high school party and signed them. Maybe he just broke up with his girl/guy friend and the Milwaukee's Best soaked feelings appreciated some of the ""soft little tulip meets inappropriately shaved lion"" dichotomy. I'm frail, I'M NOT FRAIL. Repeat. If you combined all of Dorothy's cohorts into a sound, but never let them reach Oz, this would be it.Look for a documentary that features two dudes following these guys on tour just to heckle them. Yes, it's worth it."
5,wow emo sounds good,if u dont like emo dont right about it dh i like this cd and i like other emo cd
1,scary. what were these guys thinking?,Bad Screaming. It just sounds bad. I regret wanting this album. The vocals have no talent really and I just like the drums. The lyrics sound goth to me. Again the screaming solos just sound terrible.--Sound like Ramstein-or whatever tht punk band name is.download a song by these guys before you buy the album.Sorry Silverstein
4,Not Great...Not Bad...,"I don't know really what to think of Silverstein. They start off with a punch with ""Smashed into Pieces"" and then fade off with generic music, with a few good songs here and there. There not bad, but there not great, and there straight from the book.They make up for this with at least some decent shouting (though From First to Last is better) and nice guitar, but please give me a full album of ""Smashed into Pieces"" and ""Bleed No More"" and I'll be glad to call you a great band.Close, but no cigar..."
3,85% hype...15% rock.,"With all the excellent reviews I thought silverstein would be a great musical act..but I was disappointed. The main discrepency I found in this album was lack of musical diversity from track to track. I find myself saying ""Didnt I just hear this song?.."" several times. The vocals are mediocre, with little variance in key, and a definite only two types of vocals - singing and screaming - both of which sound exactly the same in every song. Every song is about a girl...which is a lyrical failure in my eyes. It is my view that this band could have done much better, because they obviously have talent - but this go around was disappointing to say the least. Save your 12$. *Unless you like really cool artwork.*"
5,Awesome,"Their headliner is accurate. They do have the drive of Poison the Well, definitely catchiness of Saves the Day, and the 100% emotion of Thursday. You can sense all sorts of musical influences from great bands of the past. The 6/8 time throughout most of the songs is a plus, because not too many bands bother to change things up. Hell, I barely ever see 3/4 anymore. But anyway, this cd is very agressive, yet melodic, sincere yet pissed. If you're having an awry and jumbled day, this is probably a perfect cd for it. get this immediately, because it's a sure bet."
3,Oxigen sensor,"When I made the order, on the picture, you show one with the conector, ready to plug in, but when I take it out of the box, it was different, I have to make magic to re-use the old conector. In any place, you told that the conector was not included. You may have to show the real part that costomer was buing !!!!!!!"
3,"Re-worked version of ""Genius..."" plus a bit more","HFOS is a partially re-recorded version of the songs on their 1995 release ""Genius of America"". A few lyric alterations have been made, the arrangements are a bit different on some songs, and a song from Fee Waybill's 1996 solo disc ""Don't Be Scared By These Hands"" is included. The title track, which sounds like it could have been a missing track from ""Genius.."" is okay but not great.Lord knows I love The Tubes, but this disc is a collectible for the serious fan only. It will be interesting to us Tubes fans, but it will not serve as a good introduction to the band for potential new fans.Of course, you should still buy it! I mean, c'mon! Support The Tubes any and every chance you get! But for a better representative sample of their work try their stuff from their early demos to their 1983 album ""Outside/Inside""."
5,Soap box,"'Gone' is a fantastic read. Courageous, painful, hilarious and sincere; I was driven to finish the novel in one sitting. Roper's character Stephen, embodies every man's search for meaning and every man's quest to conquer his/her past--hope to shape what may come. Einstien's theory of relativity, simply, very simply put, makes the argument that there are no pitching-posts in Life, that the universe, all that it may include, moves infinately. We might try to set anchors here or there to create order, meaning, only to pull them up, move on. We are here and then gone. The book is dear to me for many reasons. I look forward to his next."
1,not really good....,"I am an avid reader of all types of books but I have to say this left me wanting to get on to a new book really quickly- there was no real character love, no real plot, no real yearning to keep reading; I did however. In the end this seemed like a poor version of a journal that was unread. Who did he care for, what did he want? I didn't like the character enough to care WTF he was doing or feeling... there was ~2 good quotes but that was it"
2,Seems cheap material,"plastic feel to it. Its ok if you decide to hang it on a pole outside but if its indoors, save yourself the embarrassment"
2,BORING,"I never thought I'd write one of these reviews, but after watching this video I just have to. I bought the tape because I liked what I read about it, but after doing the routine I'm really disappointed. To me, the most exciting part of the workout was the warm up. The rest of the tape is simply boring, because it's too repetitive. Imagine having a 30 minute workout with only 10 moves! That means you have to do the each step for 3 minutes - and I don't mean step-combinations, I mean steps. Even with the choice of ""different intensity levels"", it's just too slow for me. Plus I think the intensity levels are choices I would make on my own anyway. For example I didn't see the point in spending 3 minutes for doing ""over the tops""; first with regular step, then with power step, and finally with jumping over the step. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it more than I did..."
4,Interval workout,"This video is definitely for advanced steppers. It uses interval training--high intense bursts of energy alternating with lower intensity. It does several sets of this. Instructor demonstrates different moves to make it harder or easier. They recommend using this video with a two day break in between because it is intense. I am happy with it because I know I will really sweat and not waste any time. I won't ""out grow"" this video since the intensity can be altered. Buy it!"
2,Trying too Hard!,"Hmm. This video tries way too hard to come up with new stuff. ""Jump in the air, somersault, backflip, land in the splits, etc."" Definitely a choice for inconsistent exercisers who say they get ""bored"" easily. Arrogant instructor."
1,Anal Ease Gives It To Me In The Rear!,"Anal Ease has no numbing effect as is stated in the product descruption. The seller, Natural Health Shoppe has not responded to my e-mail. Therefore, they don't stand behind(no pun intended)the products they sell. Beware! Don't waste your money."
2,OKay,THis item was purchased because it claimed to relieve pain and discomfort while attempting anal sex. The only thing this product did was make the area slippery and sticky. Uhhhh!
1,Doesn't Work,"This did nothing for me. It was as thick as usual chap stick and kind of clumpy if you added lube. It numbed slightly for a minute, but not anywhere near enough to be worth buying a bottle."
1,Extremely poor quality and service,"I received this necklace as a birthday gift from my daughter. When I tried it on, the clasp and one of the links broke. I sent it back to the west coast and my daughter apparently returned it to Gem Avenue. Yesterday I received a box containing the original broken necklace along with a note that said returns were only good for 30 days. Because of the cross-country travel and busy schedules, 30 days wasn't a realistic turnaround. I now have an extremely tarnished, broken necklace and a form letter from Gem Avenue thanking me for my understanding. I discourage anyone from using this vendor."
3,The jury is still out on this one,"I tried this product for the first time today. What I can tell you is:1. It is easy to assemble.2. It does get snow off the roof. It's kind of cool to watch big blocks of snow slide off the roof.3. It has 4 extension tubes, but with 3 of them on it starts to get a bit unwieldy (the instructions warned me about that.)4. It does not work well in windy conditions (15 mph and up). The plastic strip that you can see hanging down in the video blows all around and gets twisted so that when you roll it up the roof and back down, one edge gets bent over and gets a crease in it.5. The plastic rips rather easily, especially around the edge. The company recommends cutting the ripped portion off and reattaching what's left to the rod.My recommendation is to use it right after it snows or on the first calm day (little or no wind.) Avoid trying to use it on a windy day, or you will not be a happy camper."
3,Not for mountain snows!,"The Avalanch worked great for fresh snowfalls of a foot or so, but at my mountain cabin (Colorado), it was overwhelmed by the two and three foot snowfalls that are common. I was wishing for aluminum rather than fibre glass poles. The fibre glass is just too flexible and heavy creating a cumbersome and unwieldy tool. It didn't take long to crack one of the poles. If the manufacture used lighter, sturdier poles, I would give this product a rousing recommendation. As it stands, the Avalanch did not meet my needs."
5,It really works!!!,Since the whole town was sold out of snow rakes I ordered this and a traditional rake from Amazon .My husband and son thought this was too wierd to work. But we all enjoyed how it worked really well!!Seems like it could rip easily so just go slow. It goes so fast compaired to traditional snow rakes that you can easily take your time. It works just like the video.
5,Avalanche parts,"Parts can be ordered from the Avalanche company, located in Plymouth, Minnesota. Their number is 1-800-378-3088."
5,Unbelievable! This is a must have for snow country!,My father is 67 suffers many physical ailments which prompted him to purchase this product. He cleared his entire roof in less than 30 minutes! He's called twice raving about the ease of this product! Without a doubt worth every dollar spent and then some. Anyone living in snow country knows how costly hiring someone to clean your roof can be. His only regret with purchasing this was that he paid more than Amazon is selling it for right now with free shipping by purchasing is locally. The drawback he's faced with now is the neighbors all borrowing it~ . Highly reccomend this!
5,jeepman,I've used this shampoo for a number of years... I was just getting tired of paying $10.00 per 10oz bottle and Amazon had a company who sold it for alot less. That's what convinced me!
4,Nexxus VitaStress Biotin Shampoo,"In Just one month there is a noticable improvement. I have used other Biotin shampoo's, but this is the first one where I have actually noticed the difference that fast."
5,Good Product,"I really think this is a great shampoo for those of us who have fine, thin hair. Even if you do not get the entire system, the shampoo (and the mousse is a fav of mine too) will be helpful. If your hair starts feeling dry, make sure you use lots of conditioner. VitaTress doesn't really have a real conditioner no matter how they are labeled."
3,It's ok,I have noticed less hair falling out in the shower etc but my hair also feels greasy - I usually only wash every other day or so and I can't do that with this shampoo my hair feels greasy and flat the next day
5,Works great,"This shampoo is great for thin hair. I love this shampoo, my hair looks wonderful and smells very inviting. You'll love it too."
4,Works well - a little drying.,"Definitely gives my hair more body/lift, but a little drying. I like the fragrance better than most Nexxus. I think I like Exoil better, even though it's supposed to be more clarifying, I don't think it dries as much."
5,Nexxus Vita Tress Biotin Shampoo,I have been using this shampoo for about a year now. I began using it because of thinning hair. This shampoo has really helped my hair by adding volume and shine. I highly recommend this product if you are experiencing this problem.
3,biotin,Personally I like nioxin better i think for shampoos it also has DHT inhibitors and think that biotin is better when taken orally as a vitamin supplement. I am a board certified MD and have thin hair myself.here is the link:[...]
3,nice shampoo,"Does a good job cleaning your hair, a little expensive for that. Using this product I didn't see any different for helping out thinning hair."
3,Doesn't lather,I wasn't able to use this long enough to determine if it worked to alleviate the symptoms of my stress induced hair loss because I was too impatient with the fact it doesn't lather. I don't feel like my hair gets clean without a nice lather!
5,Vita Tress Biotin Shampoo,"I have used this product for many years and in my opinion, ""IT ROCKS!"" The only problem is, it's becoming kinda' hard to find. I hope they NEVER DISCONTINUE IT!!! AWESOME for fine hair!"
4,shampoo for winter/dry hair,"The Nexxus VitaTress Biotin shampoo was given me 2 years ago by a friend - I have since re-ordered twice for myself and for family members as I have found it a real help with restoring strength and lustre to winter/dry hair. .....i.e., hair subjected to a hairdryer on a weekly, sometimes daily basis, when the indoors is low in humidity. Thanks Nexxus!"
1,These LEAK! Buyer beware!!!,"I bought these in 3 colors; all of which I found leak. I found out when tucking my son into bed and noticed his sheets were glowing in certain spots. I also had one sitting on my daughter's end table which left a smudge mark. When wiping it off, I found it STRIPPED THE PAINT OFF WHERE IT LEAKED!!!Take my advice and buy either a LED glowstick for around $3, or get a glow in the dark engraved wrist band if these are for your kids."
2,one long advertisement,"I am an educator who works specifically with learning disabled children, and I am always on the lookout for new techniques and approaches. I bought this book hoping for some practical recommendations.This book is one long advertisement for the DOre program. It contains very little practical information. I am annoyed at having spent ten dollars for what amounts to propoganda.Instead of this book, I recommend the Brain Gym books. The approach appears to be similar, and the books they publish contain practical, easy to implement recommendations and activities for remediating learning problems. The Brain Gym website links to independent studies supporting the efficacy of their approach."
1,"Save Your Money, It's Not a Miracle Cure","This is Winfore Dore's attempt to justify charging $4,000 and up for a system of exercises that has absolutely no effect on reading ability.The approach has been widely publicized in the US, the UK (its origination) and in Australia.If you are looking for help for your dyslexic child, I commend to you any Orton-Gillingham based multisensory teaching; Lindamood Bell (good track record); and Susan Barton's DVD-based training for parents, The Barton Method for Reading and Spelling"
3,Puzzle review,"I was very disappointed because instead of 2 assorted scene puzzles I received 2 of the same puzzle. I sent many emails to try to get this resolved and also left voicemails for the vendor, and I did not receive any reply"
3,What's Up John??,"I am a huge fan of John P. Kee. I must say that he is the baddest in the gospel industry. I wasn't feeling this CD at all. It was only three tracks on this one that I liked. ""It's in his Name"" is my favorite. I guess I didn't care for this as much because this is my first time hearing him sing solo. I'm sure he has something better coming for us. It's not a horrible CD and I still recommend people to buy it."
3,Won't play on modern computers.,"Well I got this game because I like the genre (tactical games) and a more fantasy style game seemed like it would be a lot of fun. Unfortunately the game will not run on my computer as the game has problems with vista/windows 7 systems with more than 4 gb ram. I also think it has a problem with my modern video card. And sadly even though I know only a few small modifications to the 1 mb exe file would make this game run properly. I know this because Silent Storm and Hammer & Sickle both have fan patches that fix the same problem. Sadly, the company has stated it is not going to fix the issue. And I have been unable to find a fan patch for this game. So I give the game 3 stars because i'm sure it's fun, but the lack of support is worth noting."
5,The Compassion of Animals,"I recommend this book highly but be prepared to cry when you read some of the stories. In one story, a dog gets in front of a rattlesnake to save a little baby and gives up his own life doing so.The author does a splendid job of explaning how animals have compassion for other animals and human beings."
5,For people who love animals,"These stories are warm and inspiring. My 12 year old daughter has read it a few times now, cover to cover. Great for anyone to read who loves and appreciates animals. This book really grabbed me."
3,Heartwarming but also a bit far-fetched.,"Some of the stories are so hard to believe I wonder if they are even true at all.And, the author also gushed a little too much about how animals are so selfless they are actually willing to give up their lives for the suffering humans as well as being so supersensitive they can even detect mental ailments long before the humans were actually aware of them, so I want to do a little more research on heroic animals to be certain.Needless to say, it's very nice to know that animals can also be very caring as well as intelligent."
2,Weak,"I bought this book because I like the work of Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson. But the book is very disappointing. Some of the stories are so weak. An example would be about the dog who gives jelly babies to a person who suffers from diabetis, and collapses. The dogs gives the person 2 jelly babys, wakes the person and the 2 jelly babies give the person enough strenght to reach for a more substantial bar of sweets. My wife suffers from diabetis and we both had to shake our head of reading so much nonsense. Also the conclusions the authors draws from the stories are very questionable. Don't get me wrong, as I said before I love the work of Masson and I think that other species have as much feelings as human beings (just another animal, i.e. species) have. But this book was too much for me."
5,Great watch,I couldn't be more pleased. Very accurate and I can't tell you how many times I've banged this against sharp metal corners. It seems the more I try to avoid them the more I hit them. I would look down at the watch and see what looks like a long scratch but it turns out to be just the white paint from the metal railing I keep hitting it against. Rubs right off the glass without a hint of an actual scratch. I've also received a lot of compliments on the looks.
3,Eh,I listened to these guys back in high school. It was better then. I love the music but I can't take the singer so much in large doses. This is my favorite record of this band.
4,Suspenseful read,"This is a well written and suspenseful book, with a richness of detail reminiscent of Stephen King. The fighter pilot sequences are especially exciting. I look forward to more books by Mr. Bailey."
4,Interesting topic and characters,"What an interesting look at an ancient horror. Bailey puts a different spin on the old monster genre and presents some pretty compelling characters. For those familiar with Ft. Worth like me, it is a real treat to read about familiar landmarks and real places. The book reads fast and easily and is very entertaining. It was the perfect companion for the wife and I during a road trip last week. Gave her the creeps. If you like horror with a twist, check it out."
5,Works great,"I was a little uncertain how ordering this would go, since the reviews had been varied, and the product looks a little shady (e.g. the pastoral cover drawing). Still, this was the only place I could find that sells beneficial nematodes in small quantities and thus for less than $50/pop - we did not need much, since all we were dealing with was our fruit-fly-infected worm bin - so I took a chance. Long story short, the nematodes worked a small miracle and about two weeks after applying the mixture to our worm bin, we are fruit fly free. For those interested, the worms did not appear negatively affected by this nematode mixture, either."
3,Hirt response to questions is spot on,I've read reviews of people complaining about the rudeness or lack or help figuring out how to deal with this product. Well I've emailed twice and received a response within a few hours from Mark Hirt. His response is short but direct and I appreciate his taking the time to do this even on a Sunday night. The product was just put down and will respond later about it effectiveness. I feel pretty good about it and very good about the company!
4,It works!,I had tons of moths in my potted jasmine brush and after a week... they were gone. Some bugs returned 2 months after applying... so I reapplied.
4,hungry little buggers...,I purchased these to take care of fungus gnats larvae that was in the compost i had purchased.they seemed to do their job in conjunction with sticky traps and better attention to proper watering.I would purchase these again if needed.
2,Didn't Help With Gnats - Insufficient Cooling Means Dead on Arrival?,"I ordered this with hopes it would fix a serious gnat problem I've been having with my indoor plants. I followed the instructions, but even after a few days there didn't seem to be any change in the number of gnats hatching from my plants (and has never been, weeks later). I think the problem may have been insufficient cooling on the way here. I ordered the product in early summer in Las Vegas, when temperatures were in the high 90s Fahrenheit. Even though I picked it up from my mailbox only a couple hours after it was delivered, I believe it got too hot and killed the critters. There was only a tiny ice cube sized cool pack in the box, which was warm to the touch."
4,Bugs be gone!,"The first time I used this product, it worked like a charm. The bugs seemed to go away and the grass quit dying. The second time I used it, it didn't go as well, however i think the extreme heat of the days using it contributed to the problem. I still think this is a very usable product and will try again when the weather isn't so intense."
5,"Slow, but very effective","I bought these last fall, when we developed a huge flea problem. Treated the cat for the indoor fleas, but they would attack us the moment we walked into the yard ... sometimes more than a dozen flea bites in under 5 minutes. I spread the nematodes around according to the directions around in September 2009. I do have to say that they don't go as far as you would hope, but we have a small yard so it wasn't a problem.This year (2010) we have nary a flea. The winter killed the adult fleas and the nematodes killed the flea larvae in the soil.If you need a quick fix, especially for fleas, this may not be for you, but if you want something to apply in the fall to prevent the fleas from coming back in the spring, these worms can't be beat."
2,who knows,This product's success is very elusive to determine. We had a problem with fleas in our backyard and this product did not seem to help.
3,Okay?,"I like the concept of using nature against nature, but I can't tell if it worked or not. Bought this a few months ago and we still have a large population of cucumber baby beetles... I know every insect control isn't 100% and I could tell a decrease in population... I also wish the nematodes would overwinter, but I can't really find information saying that's probable."
3,Scanmask Review,"Easy purchase, delivered quickly, yet harder to apply than anticipated. Long shelf life, thorough instructions. My research of various nematode products indicated that most arrive in sponge form which are sprayed on areas desired to be treated. This product is a granular type form. For me it was difficult to apply the first round, but I have enough left over to try again at a later date. I have not been able to notice a difference since applying, then again, I am not sure if I applied it correctly. I will be trying again in the coming weeks."
1,Didn't work this time...,"Beneficial nematodes are great! Last year, I used them on my lawn in late spring, and our two dogs didn't have a flea for about 10 months. It was heavenly and it was a different brand.This year, I applied them again expecting the same great results. We were disappointed when the first application didn't make a dent in our flea population. The seller kindly refunded my money and I bought a second application, thinking it would do the trick. Unfortunately, it didn't. We saw no change after two applications. Now we're stuck using toxic flea remedies because it's now too hot to apply them.I do commend the seller, however. He was quick to respond to email questions and was also quick to refund my money."
1,"Killed some plants, still have pests","I applied this product to all my indoor plants a couple months ago per the instructions on the box. Two of my plants died shortly after application (a chili pepper plant and a succulent), which I had kept in good condition for years (really, how do you kill a succulent??). Now, I still have pests flying around my home and two fewer plants. Customer service was neither helpful nor understanding when I called. I will not buy from these guys again.**Update: As an experiment I bought a small, healthy succulent to replace one that was killed and put it in the same soil. It died within two weeks. There is something seriously wrong here."
5,fungus gnats are gone,"it does work in worm bin. do not use water application so, use peat moth or the medium itself when you get it soaked and make your 2 gallon of water solution. took care of my fungus gnats problem in house plants too. it worked where gnat-roll did not. gnats will go in 2 weeks+, the adults need to die off (that's 12 days or so), also the dirt need to be moist, nematodes need water to establish.do not see it very effective on composting mites so, maybe there are little less of it maybe not, hard to tell, gnats are gone so."
5,Am glad we purchased this interesting items on Amazon,Our staff said the stuff worked...! No chemicals. Am glad we purchased this interesting items on Amazon. You should buy some of the stuff too...!
1,Does not work for me,It's been a week now since I started the treatment and I still see millions gnats roaming around the pots that I brought inside for the winter season. I'm going to try gnatrol to see if it may work better.
4,duck hunting all my life,"i was raised hunting by my stepfather and father. i enjoyed this game. it is fun and exciting. it is very close to the same as real duck hunitng, minus a few things, but overall this game is perfect for anyone who likes to hunt. it would be great for fathers teaching younger kids the sport of hunting."
4,"Great book, different outlook on the man+his work","Oustanding commentary, well researched and insightful. The text here is mighty different from other commentaries on Wright, and feels much more substantive. Ony con: not enough images + some floorplans are reproduced too small to read clearly. - not a photo overview, a study on the man."
3,This book needs a proofreader!,"The content of this book was pretty good but it is in dire need of a proofreader. There are so many typographical, spelling, grammatical and factual errors that it distracts from the enjoyment of the book. Like for example, Kurt Busch's crew chief is Jimmy Fennig, not Fenning. It is the Charlie Daniels Band, not Charley. There are many spelling errors: championship is spelled championshiop. There's a whole paragraph about the author running into Jack Roush at a bar that has nothing to do with anything else in the chapter. The author seems to be very judgmental of Nascar fans - feeding into the stereotype that all Nascar fans are beer-drinking redneck southerners. The whole 40-some page introduction was very diary-like, not very professional at all. I have enjoyed reading the book and have learned a lot about Nascar that I did not know before but the errors really stand out."
2,Get the Facts Right!,"The factual errors in this book are amazing, especially coming from a heavy-duty dude at Newsweek magazine. Contrary to what the book reports; the Cup all-star race and Coca-Cola 600 are not held in July, Terry Labonte did not win the 1990 Daytona 500 when Dale Earnhardt ran out of gas on the last lap and the 1996 championship was not settled by a margin of eight points.The book also reads like a series of magazine articles strung together. Moving from one chapter to the next, the reader is forced to read through too much information that was already reported in the previous chapter. Yes, for example, I know Dale Earnhardt was killed in the 2001 Daytona 500; please don't feel required to tell me that in every chapter.Confidential to the ""Editor of the International Edition of Newsweek Magazine"": Don't quit your day job."
2,Very disappointing...,"I do switched on schoolhouse classes nearly everyday and I often come out with mixed feelings about the setting and methods of the ciriculum. Maybe because I started this at an older age, I didn't appreciate it much, however, I was expecting a bit more from this.Basically you start out learning basic greetings and phrases, however, things turn down from there. After only a few useful lessons, important things are skipped, such as how to ask for directions, counting, and even how to have a REAL conversation. Instead we get to learn about the farm, how to name the animals and describe their actions. I'm no professional, but my cousin only just started that section in the public schools and she's on her third or fourth year!Do not get this ciriculum for Spainish, it's really lame."
2,film: 2.5 video quality: 2,This film by Hungarian filmmaker Márta Mészáros has a simple plot. A girl who works at a factory meets a university student at a college party. At first she lies to him about her position and tells him she is a student also. Even when she tells him the truth he would rather have her continue on with the deception. The social commentary is the best thing about the movie.Now I'm not the type who is usually fussy about video quality but with this picture it's a different story. White on black and white subtitles aren't a good idea. I couldn't read more about half the subtitles of this movie. This takes away from the enjoyment of the movie.
3,Doesn't fit all Art of Shaving brushes,"I bought this thinking it would fit all brushes (I didn't know there were different sizes), it doesn't. My husbands brush rests on its bristles and isn't held up like it should be."
5,Great Timing!,"Fast, Easy, Quality.This is a great way to help organize your bathroom! I would recommend one to anyone shaving!"
4,Works as it should,It's plastic - therefore won't rust.Doesn't fall down.Fits my badger brush with ease (got the art of shaving brush as a gift)Recommended over competitors because of price.
5,"As described, and what you would expect.",This is exactly as the description and picture. What you would expect. Shiny plastic holds shaving brush perfectly. Fair price for the item.
4,It's plastic that holds a brush,"But it's so much more....well not really. I got this to put in my dopp kit (hey, brushes need to dry properly, even on the road) and it does the job. It doesn't take up much room at all (in the bag or out). I gave it 4 out of 5 because I think this is a $5 product instead of $10."
1,Cheap.,Don't buy something just because it is made by a reputable company. Not worth the plastic it's made out of.
4,great brush holder,"this little holder is very functional and sturdy. I have been using it for a number of months, and the only thing I can think that is wrong is that it is a bit short so if you have a long handled brush it could be an issue. However, it more than handles the standard shaving brush and I would recommend to get it."
1,really,"Just recieved this item today and the first thing I thought was ""really"" what was I thinking? 8.50 plus shipping and handling for this dinky piece of plastic. Save your money and find something similiar local. Then you wont kick yourself for way over paying for something you can find in the dollar store............"
1,"If you want to workout, don't buy this tape.","I have always bought Petra's tapes without a second thought. Not anymore! A veteran stepper, I spent more time trying to figure out what she was doing than I did stepping. I gave it a second chance - simply too fast, too complicated and not much of a workout."
3,Fun and challenging.,"This tape has some challenging routines that make you want to keep on doing it till you get them. It is fun, the time goes by quickly but it is a little low keyed and doesn't get my heart rate up as much as most tapes I've done."
2,Too dancey moves,"I have been doing step for so long I thought I should give this one a shot, but I am dissapointed in the video. The moves are too dancey. It makes you fee like sit down and watch it again and again before you do them fluently. Who has time for that? Being a mom of 2 kids I need something practical and easy to follow to ,so I can break a sweat before my little ones wake up. This video leaves me frusturated and makes me feel that I didn't get a good workout. I guess I won't be using this tape very much. I reccomend this tape for people who love dancing and have been dancing for sometime..."
2,Too complicated,"This video is too hard to follow. The instuctor is more concerned about getting fancy choreography into this workout than actually getting on the step. I used this video about three times before I said forget it, I'm not enjoying my workout at all!"
5,Using this tape for over a year & still my favorite!,"I bought this tape about a year ago. I was NOT a dancer, and I was a beginner/intermediate stepper. It took me several run-throughs to get the moves down, but the effort was well worth it. I've lost that last 10 pounds & kept it off. This tape is as challenging as you make it. It's still my favorite tape. Great cardio workout--heart pumping."
1,crappy,i am very upset with this video it was very hard and annoying and I am an adanced stepper. Too dancy and pointless!!! Sorry!! Don't waste your time because I wanted to hurt this tape really bad!
1,My least favorite step video !,"I consider myself an intermediate to advanced stepper , so I was disappointed in this video . Choppy , hoppy and not much fun ."
2,Very difficult to understand the instructor,This is the first Gin Miller exercise video I have purchased (and will certainly be the last). It was very diffucult for me to understand Ms. Miller. The camera moved around too much - it was difficult to follow the moves and I couldn't understand the instructor - not a good purchase - save your money -
4,Size,"This shirt runs really big. I bought it for my husband in a size medium an it swallowed him. A small would probably have fit, but elected to return it for a refund as the postage back and forth adds up."
4,Music for all moments!!!,"The Frenéticas were a brazilian girl group from the 70's...This album contains some of their greatest songs that can make you move all night with the simple but cheerful 70's beat with a brazilian spice that makes them unique...If u like the easy listening 70's groove, that's for you...And I garantee you that this album will cheer you up for the whole day...and night!!!"
3,Assembly problems,"Unless you are mechanically handy, do not buy a bike in a box. Also, the wrong pedals were sent in this box apparently they were 1/2"" instead of 3/8"" threads. I found this out when I went to pay $40 to have this bike assembled. We like the bike OK, but it cost quite a bit to have assembled and the pedals were wrong."
1,Very poor craftsmenship,"I had to send this bike back because the holes for the pedals to attach to the bike were not drilled large enough for them to fit through! I did not bother to replace it after that. Schwinn was good about the return though, good customer service."
4,Son really liked it.....,"my son got this for his birthday. He like the story, read it the whole way through. And for him thats a great book, he's never sits that long. I do not believe in telling about the story...but if your child is now begining to read well, and enjoys spooky things, then do them a favor buy something they will enjoy."
4,The Science of Radio,I thought the history of radio was as good as the description of how it works. I was in college in the 50's; there was a lot that I did not learn about AM radio. For me the book was excellent. Prentiss Robinson
3,a good book with bad opinions,"This is an excellent book which combines the history, themathematics and the physics of radio. It is not a textbookand you need to know calculus and physics to understand itstechnical chapters. It has ten appendices, they explain the""bottom"" material or background needed in the book. However,the all book is well written and it has an excellent presentation.I think that the author's opinions about theradio developers such as Marconi, DeForest and Teslaare out of place in a book like this. So I gave three starts."
3,Really three-and-a-half stars out of four. Pete Special and Jon Brant work well together. But where is 'Rebel Come Back'?!,"Local Chicago talent Pete Special has beendemo-ing cuts for many years. He and JonBrant never did get that one disk out yearsago but were on Chicago radio. A girl I knowsent me an audio copy. Great stuff. That wasafter the Bun E. Carlos Experience did abootleg Live LP with Jon on it. Pete doesreal good work on Mozart Street. It's longoverdue. Don't take Offence to the threestar rating here on Amazon, Pete S. fans.They won't give me half starts. Good stuff,Pete! Now, where's Pete Comita?!"
4,His distinctive voice and musical flair rank with the best,"I was totally floored when I first heard this CD.His distinctive voice coupled with his polished delivery on songs like Mozart Street,When Something is Wrong With My Baby make you forget your surroundings.His playfulness on the songs Hold on and Inside out make me want to get up and dance. Soulfully delightful.Music to my ears."
5,Great watch winder!!,The winder does exactly what the description says. I've read other reviews that say it is loud. I put it on my dresser a few feet from my bed and I don't hear it at all. I even listened to it closely and heard nothing. It's beautiful and exactly what I was looking for. I very highly recommend it!
5,Works and Looks Great,No problems after 7 months of ownership. The winder is very quiet and looks great on the dresser. Very classy looking and the little drawer is very convenient. Bought it as a gift and would reccomend it.
4,Husband Loves It!,"This is a very nice watch winder (the same one is in SkyMall magazine for $400+!). We sleep with it about 2 feet from the bed...it does have a soft humming noise when it turns. But if anything, it's soothing- far from annoying :) I have to mention that the cherry wood color is more like a dark brown (mine doesn't have a reddish tint at all)- so something to consider. Still very elegant looking!"
4,Great Looking and Quiet Watchwinder,"This is my first watch winder and I am very satisfied. It is a VERY quiet motor, which barely makes a sound when in operation. It also looks great on my counter. I would recommend it!"
2,Quad Automatic Watch Winder,"This winder works just fine, but it is getting progressively louder. Since it is in my bedroom, it tends to keep me awake if it starts running while trying to go to sleep. It does its job just fine, but the noise is unacceptable.I cannot recommend this winder--unless it is in another room."
2,"seller, Ace Photo","Review concerns the seller, not the product. Received notice today that my purchase for a package of cotton gloves ($12.95) was shipped at a charge of $10.99. That doubles the cost, and nowhere did I, nor do I now, see a notice indicating shipping charges in that amount. At that charge I would not have ordered from this retailer! Ridiculous!"
4,"Great book, great price.",Shipment was fast. Product was as described in the written description. Enjoy the quality of the book and the inside information.
5,Superb Book on Jackie's Clothes,"Beautiful photographs of the dresses, suits, coats, hats and gowns worn by Jackie before and during the White House years. Descriptions of the fabrics and the construction of each garment reveal the thought and attention to detail that this most stylish of our first ladies gave to her clothing. No fashion victim was she. It is clear from the narrative that Jackie had a perfect sense of who she was and a definite idea of how she wanted to look. Amazing when one considers she was only 31 when she entered the White House. Truly deserving of her iconic status."
1,"Well, if you want to know who SEWED her clothes.....","...then this is the book for you. Another reviewer was right, this is a fashion text book, for fashion students and design students, but it's a lot of money to spend on a text book and it is written in a highly technical style and is not an easy, fun or elegant book to read. And I guess it's not really a book, it's a museum catalogue.Fine for some people, or some fashion school libraries, but not for me...a purchase ""faux-pas""."
3,Lovely Photos but Sterile,"I enjoyed this book greatly for the detailed photographs of Jackie's clothes--I think it makes the perfect companion to Oleg Cassini's A Thousand Days of Magic, which has terrific sketches and period photos but not many detailed pictures. The essays are disappointing, but in my opinion the photos make it worth owning."
1,"Nice, but a little dull","This is a nice book about Jackie Kennedy's clothes, but the overall impression it leaves is one of sterility and standoffishness... almost as if everyone is apologizing that she was such a fashion icon...The clothes are presented in a very museum-y way with big photographs of clothes on mannequins and little tiny pictures of Jackie actually in the clothes...after a while, it becomes a little dull to keep reading and reading about pleats and a-lines and technical dressmaking terms when you really want to hear some of the stories behind the clothes...like how much they cost (it must have been a bundle)...The whole thing looks a little like leftovers...it's an odd collection of some hats, some gowns, some dresses, some really old clothes that aren't from the White House years...It's not worth the... I spent on it..."
1,"Too ""Inside Fashion"" for most tastes...","If you want to know who sewed all of Jackie's clothes, then I guess this is the book for you...This book is much more academic and fusty than I expected it to be, the tone is serious serious serious and it's all about bust darts and seaming and inner construction and linings, etc., but it says very little about Jackie as a person, and nothing really about all the interesting things she did in the White House.Very expensive too, so, unless you're a fashion historian, try JACKIE STYLE, or even better, JACKIE'S CAMELOT CLOTHES."
5,Beautiful book,This makes a wonderful gift. Beautiful collection of photos and stories of Jacqueline Kennedy while in the white house. .
1,"There are other, better outlets and suppliers","This is not what was advertised. Instead of coming in a blue, velvet box it came in a cheap, flimsy, red-striped box. When I returned it, Amazon kept nearly half the money for a ""return charge"".I won't order anything from this company,or Amazon, again."
3,Artsy Tubes effort,"On this effort, the Tubes cover multiple genres. There's lots of lush piano (""Smoke"", ""Hit Parade""), twangy, blusey guitars (""Golden Boy"", ""Strung Out On Strings""- an often overlooked Tubes gem), eclectic odd-ball ditties (""My Head Is My Only House Unless It Rains"", ""Cathy's Clone"", ""I'm Just A Mess""), a take on Sinatra (""This Town""), and a song about a frail guy with large genitalia (""Pound Of Flesh""). This hodgepodge comes together on the closer, ""You're No Fun"" (if Steeley Dan and the Ramones had a baby, it would sound like this), which somehow combines over-the-top prog-rock synthesizers and 1970s jazz-rock, capped by a frenetic neo-punk rock climax. This commercial dud doesn't match the grandiose bombastic genius of the band's debut, and bears no resemblence to the pop-funk of their 80's efforts. But for true fans, this is a long over-due release of an interesting and strangely compelling disc."
5,Can't go wrong with Petra,"I must admit that after enjoying a very short segment of Petra on the Push DVD's, I have gotten hooked on her methods. She is happy but not over the top. She does moves that take a little thinking but aren't exceptionally hard. She is logical in how she teaches a new move, step by step. You do NOT have to repeat over and over and over. This particular DVD is separated into segments so you can choose how long you want the workout to be. And I love it that her back-up exercisers look like normal people!You can't go wrong with Petra."
1,Not A Good Value,"When this 15oz can of product is fully dispensed - there is only about 7.24 ounces of actual product that reamins. The rest is propellant, carrier and dispersant. This was tested by using a 7 foot length of 1"" OD flexible tubing that has an ID of .75. When measured after fully dispensing the product there is about 7.24 ounces left of actual parts cleaner. Buying a case of this product will yield you about 86.8 ounces of parts cleaner versus 180 ounces of gross product. I'm using ounces as a measure of volume, not weight. Most of what you are paying for is evaporated as the product is dispensing. Talking to many mechanics, the reason they like this product is because they believe it's in-expensive. I'll let the public decide."
4,Together..again!,An interesting thing Motown did back in the 60's... they reunited two acts that began their careers singing together on the streets of Detroit. On these two classic albums combined on one disc you'll hear the Supremes exchange melodies with the Tempts on classic songs like I'LL TRY SOMETHING NEW and I'M GONNA MAKE YOU LOVE ME. An even more poignant moment occurs when the two super groups perform THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM...something they had dared to do...and at this point in their careers they had certainly come to the realization (except for poor Florence Ballard) that some dreams do come true.
2,where are all the good songs?,This CD had some good songs on it but I was disappointed in most of the selections that were on it. There were many good songs from the seventies that could have been on this CD.
3,Interesting topic - average writing,"The story of Manute Bol leaving Sudan to end up playing in the NBA with a seven figure salary is interesting subject material, even if you're not a basketball fan. I enjoyed the book, although the writing is weak due to the author's failure to address the story in a straightforward manner. In what I believe is the author's attempt at cleverness in trying to punctuate the story with short, declarative sentences and phrases, the flow and movement of Manute's story is compromised. The end result is a choppy, somewhat rambling story that left me with the feeling I had most of the story and most of the facts, but I needed to organize and restructure them. That is the author's job, not the reader."
1,Manute: the center of two worlds,"This is not so much a comment about the product as of the service. The book never arrived. The loss in money was slight, but still a disappointment."
3,aa all the way,i enjoyed this book.I was a huge fan of the Horsemen in the 80's and was hoping to get some dirt. However arn simply tells story lines as if they were real life.the curtain was raised years ago on pro wrestling so arns stories are a little disapointing because he writes them like the readers still arent in on the secret.all in all i still enjoyed hearing arns side of things.HORSEMEN-4-EVER
3,"A good book, but a little disapointed","If you are a profesional wrestling fan, I would recomend reading this book, though if you are a ""smart mark"" you may be a little frustrated that he doesn't really break ""Kay-fabe"". If you don't know what these two words means, then you will love this book. Enjoy reading about Arn Anderson and the Four Horseman!"
2,Not a must,"I knew what to expect when I bought this book, but I still wanted to have it in my collection. It's that kind of book, good to have, but not a must. It's all written in kayfabe, and that's uncomfortable to read after all the great books that came shortly after. To give you an idea, he never even said was his real last name is. There are some interesting stories, but Arn protects everyone with cover-up stories and that becomes fast uninteresting. The cover shows tons of great pictures in small print, but unfortunatly you won't find any good picture inside. At least you get a grasp of his passion for wrestling. The title says it all:that's just a small, very small look behind the curtain, by a man who had obviously so much more to tell."
1,Sizes unrealistic and very bad customer service,"I am a size 12 woman. I used the Galaxy Army Navy sizing chart (which was VERY confusing) and chose a size large- very typical for me. When the shirt arrived, it was the same size as one of my daughter's Child's size Medium!! It is cut way too small for an average woman.When I called to get help from the company, our conversations were very frustrating. He cut off my sentences, kept telling me I had the correct size - ""it has spandex and will stretch to fit"", and that their size charts are accurate. (Although he had a hard time finding the correct chart to use, too! He was not willing to help or listen to my concerns. I was still willing to order another shirt so I asked for the ""specs"" on another style. Almost 2 weeks later.... no specs. A very frustrating dealing with this company....I doubt I'll get my refund...we'll see...."
5,The best visual book on Napoleon Bonaparte,"There are numerous books on Napoleon Bonaparte, but this is THE book that I had to possess on the great man himself. The visual feast of illustrations compiled in this book alone more than justifies the ridiculously low price of the book relative to other pictorial books on the same subject. The judicious use of illustrations and the careful editing of two writing styles, one by Meneval (Napoleon's secretary) and the other by Constant (Napoloen's valet), by Proctor-Jones has transformed what could have been a boring translation of two French diaries into a vivid account of Napoleon's life as Emperor of Rome. Both accounts may have been biased in favour of the Emperor but Proctor-Jones was clever in not interjecting any of his personal opinions as editor and thereby, has created a classic work on the subject."
4,John Leguizamo LIVE,"First of all, John Leguizamo is a pure comedic genious. Although he uses alot of so called ""toilet humor"" and talks about alot of sexual and somewhat perverted things, you can't help but laugh at this great, funny album!Throughout the whole album John talks about his childlife, his parents, his weird family, him becoming an adult, and amoung other things talks about his farting problems in a track called ""Fart Asphyxiation"", which is hilarious! He talks alot about sex, believe me, and the humor he uses in those tracks is very offensive to some people. But we have to remember that this is all in pure, good fun, it is not put out there to offend anyone. Plus John is talking about himself, not someone else!Overall: A purely hilarious album from comedic genious John Leguizamo!Grade: B+"
2,Big Clip,"The clip with this cover is very bulky causing it to stick out too far. Also, clip is made of what seems to be a really cheap plastic and would easily break off."
4,The Lobotomist,Very good short history of lobotomies. It was rather short in length and left me wanting to learn more. It is also pretty graphic and I had to look away at times.
4,Israel Academy Winner,"Based on a story by the Czech writers Pavel and Yelena Kohout. Winner of Israel's 1996 equivalent of the Academy Award. A futuristic Israeli film about a clairvoyant seventh grader named Clara, a Russian immigrant to a small Israeli town in the Negev Desert who lives in a trailer at the edge of town. Like many adolescents, she hates her teachers and principal at Golda Meir High School. The town is thrown into a tumult by her arrival (i.e. - is this a metaphor for the arrival of new immigrants? Does Golda Meir High represent the old Labor Party?), and she must deal with her fame as a fortune teller (forseeing the winning Lotto numbers), and must choose whether to lose her gifts in return for the love of the local rebel hunk (i.e.- is this a metaphor for assimilation) or to keep her mystical powers. A story of teen love of the anarchic rebellion punk variety. (Lots of nutty Russian characters from Israel's Gesher Theatre Troupe)"
2,I wish I'd liked this book as much as Kirkus did,"I love Carl Reiner's work, and I especially loved ""Enter Laughing,"" both the novel and the film. But this sequel doesn't have any of the charm of the original-- it's more a memoir than a novel, which means it has no real dramatic structure; it's a series of anecdotes told in the third person with names changed. A grave disappointment from a terrifically talented man."
3,Good and bad,"I like this magazine and just renewed my subscription. Two things I don't like ...1. The cover titles are deceiving. Example: They'll say someone is ""leaving forever"" when they're not leaving the show ... just leaving a relationship. Many articles are not what they seem based on the cover's titles. But, that's OK. The articles are usually pretty good anyway.2. The news is often old by the time it's printed. That happens because it only comes out every 2 weeks. I also read Soap Opera Digest, which is weekly and more up to the minute.But, overall I like this magazine because of the feature articles on each show. I like that they are all ABC shows. I don't care about shows on other channels so magazines that feature those are just waste of paper for my tastes."
2,Biased...IMHO,"IMHO...the magazine has creepy bias towards one ABC soap actress, her character and the character's wannabe pairing in particular. The interviews seem skewed and edited to make some look good and others not so much. Not gonna waste my hard earned money on the musings of some glorified fangirls. I want something objective, fair, and unbiased something to match what I see onscreen."
1,have not received the item yet!!!!!!,Would love to review if I had received it but I have not gotten the first issue yet!! Any idea why?
1,Second time failure,This is the second time I have tried to get a complete works of William Shakespeare in Spanish and they send me the English edition. I paid 29.29 cents to return a set of books that cost only 22 dollars to purchase. Not happy. Dan C
1,Too Bulky,"I purchased for my 14 year-old son, and this watch is extremely heavy and bulky. It looks fine in the picture, but the head is way to big."
3,Super Size Sports Chronograph with Super Weak Crystal,"Received my items in 3 working days from order, superb shipping from UPS.I was very impressed with the watch. It has 46mm bezel, just like i wanted it. But one week after i bought it, accidentally i lightly bumped my left hand where i wore the watch to a building pillar. Checked my watch thereafter and found scratches mark on the crystal, proved that the mineral crystal is very prone to scratches."
2,big and heavy,"This watch looked nice, but was big and heavy. I did not think my husband would want such a heavy watch so I sent it back."
5,Alternate Elvis,"Elvis Presley never recorded the same song twice, as evidenced in the numerous alternate takes from his 1960-68 Nashville sessions. ""Long Lonely Highway"" reveals several hidden treasures, such as Presley's radically different approach to Chuck Berry's ""Too Much Monkey Business"" and an intriguing slow version of ""Stay Away."" Other highlights include previously unreleased takes of ""It's Now or Never,"" ""She's Not You"" and ""Fools Fall in Love."" Though no longer in print, this CD remains among the best Elvis imports you're likely to find."
1,Am I reading the price right?,"I have buying the Dark Shadows DVD sets and then I see DVD set# 22.. and it is priced at $ 99.00 dollars! What? I bought lots of them used , some as low as 7.99. Why the huge price for this set? What am I missing???help."
5,Yeah Dark Shadows,You have to love a show that doesn't take it's self seriously. I grew up watching this show with my mom and now I'm watching it with my daughter who just loves it too.
4,The longest climax possible! Screams Movie!,"The book was quite good. It held my interest, which is hard to do. The climax of the book lasted for over 200 pages. I just couldn't put the book down. The only thing I didn't like was that it seemed to have a little too much of a Christian theme to it near the end. It seemed to almost preach religion here and there, but other than that, I say it's an excellent book. I recommend it. The characters were very well developed. It also alost seems perfect for a movie."
3,Solar fizzle,"Each of Larry Burkett's books seems to be a little less enjoyable and a bit more predictable than the last. I loved The Illuminati and I liked The Thor Conspiracy, but I could take or leave Solar Flare. The writing is a bit too simplistic, melodramatic, and repetitive for me. But if you enjoy Christian fiction, it's still a decent read."
5,Excellent reading,"First, you have to realize the Christian basis for this book.Second, once you take the Christian basis for this into account, then you can realize where others have problems with this book. Religion is always a sticky point for some people.It is VERY well written, well thought out, excellent story line and not difficult to follow or keep reading. Much of what was read in this book could very well be what we may see in our near future, without the need of a solar flare to push things over the edge."
4,Good Science Fiction - Overdone Social Commentary,"The solutions to social problems were simplistic, but that didn't spoil the story for me. I enjoyed the fantasy that seventeenth century justice could solve all the worlds problems. Don't know if the science was accurate, but it was believeable."
1,Novel falls far short of goals,"One of the worst novels I have ever read. As an evangelical Christian I can appreciate the urge to promote Christian principles and ideals especially since there is a definite anti-Christian bias in the media both in TV and secular novels but this novel isn't the answer. It is so badly written that it is almost laughable. It's impossible to take it seriously. The characters are simply not believable -- they are stereotypes and caricatures. Better choices are Grisham's ""The Testament"", any of Frank Peretti's novels or the novels of Jan Karron."
3,"Good, not his best","The story line was interesting, not well developed. My husband and I read Solarflare together over the course of 2 months as we would travel in the car together, so we were always interested in the next segment of the drama. We enjoyed Illumiati much more. One other reviewer said this would be a good book for a teen, we tend to agree."
1,Please don't waste your time reading this!,"It's quite possible that this is worst book I have ever read. The premise is a very good one-a solar flare causing a return to 19th century technology in the US. However, Burkett writes in such a sloppy style that the topic begs for another writer to craft a decent story. Burkett's transitions are abrupt (and, at times, nonexistent), characters are undeveloped and occasionally given to nearly schizophrenic ""out-of-characterness,"" and his dubious preaching shoves honest storytelling out of the way. The characters often seemed to be merely fictional mouthpieces for Burkett's own opinions. I was so disgusted with this book that I couldn't finish it (extremely rare for me). I realize ""Solar Flare"" is intended as ""Christian"" fiction (using Burkett's extremely narrow definition of Christianity), but the result is poor fiction."
2,"Great idea, terribly executed.","The only reason this book gets two stars is because of the premise of the story. The characters were rediculous. I am a conservative, but I don't enjoy reading about totally virtuous conservatives and totally depraved liberals. The author, whoever that may be, SCREAMED points that should have been whispered. Not only should the author find another line of work, but the editor should do the same. There were many obvious errors and repetitions. I don't read a lot of novels and was very displeased to have picked such a bad one."
2,Disappointing,"I was anxious to read thie book since I loved The Illuminati, but were the two books even written by the same author? It was not the exciting story I had hoped for. The same cliches were repeated about every 3 pages. The book had almost no Christian emphasis. There were needless accounts of murders, one right after the other. I wanted to say, ""Okay, we got the point 150 pages ago. Now get on to something interesting."" Too little plot + too many pages = disaster."
1,Solar Flare: A Boring Time Waster,"Reading Solar Flare was a reading assignment for a portion of my studies in my 8th Grade Science class. I was continuously bored while reading this 456 page book. I think that the characters were developed much too quickly and often new characters were added. Confusion was not a rare occurrence. I also found that every conversation was repeated atleast 15 times throughout the entire book. I have read better short stories written by fellow writing students in my 8th Grade class. I learned nothing about solar flares ,really, that I didnt already know. But I give Mr. Burkett a mercy point. I feel sorry for a man who spent that much time on a book that is undeveloped as far as character sketches and plot. I don't think Larry Burkett should try to go beyond his scientific professionality and try to double as a writer. People just aren't interested in that. But if you really want to read something to pass the time and entertain yourself, dont get this book to read."
1,Thinly veiled political trash,"Burkett's novel Solar Flare is nothing but strident conservativism thinly disguised as speculative fiction. Not worth buying. Or, if you like this sort of thing, just pick up a copy of The Turner Diaries."
3,Okay,"Overall, the DVD includes several good episodes of Franklin. However, the cover of the dvd has Franklin's little sister Harriett on it so I was hoping that meant she was in the dvd episodes. My daughter loves her character, but unfortunately she did not appear in them so I was a bit disappointed."
5,Extremely well written and performed.,This movie draws the viewer in from the beginning to the end with its vintage-view footage and protrayal of emotions that the famous Roosevelt family experienced. The cinematograpy and music adaptation are the perfect element added to this skilled cast! Well done.
3,Chicago Cutlery paring knife,I don't think this product lives up to the name of Chicago Cutlery. I found the knife to be dull after being used only a few times
5,excellent product,"I am very pleased with my new Cellet Stingray cover for my Nokia 6030 cell phone. I looked at several different stores, including the cellular store where I live plus at least two large stores in a metro area, and could not find a protective cover made exclusively for my telephone. I finally found it on Amazon.com -- the first time I ordered it the store didn't have it in stock, but when I ordered a second time (this time from Accessory Export) I received the item I wanted in a timely manner."
2,I had hopes...,"I had hopes that this would be a documentary minus all the twaddle of PBS leftist but no such luck.The usual pontificating leftist professors brought up ""SOCIAL JUSTICE"" code word for communism.(SEE Yuri Bezmenov former KGB agent video on Google video and you tube.)The vocabulary of Saul Alanski is used repetitiously as they try to link the political left to His cause.There is the usual leftist rant about other political activists such as Desmond Tutu a known communist and others who are affiliated with the communist agenda. They bring up as examples of those men who later followed Wilberforce's example.They try to portray Wilberforce as a follower of Humanism and not a Good Christian.His Christianity gets in the way of some of the Professors that are the talking heads on this video.The fact William Wilberforce is on a calling from God is degraded with the phase"" In spite of being a Christian Wilberforce did the work of a political activist.""PBS needs to be defunded."
5,Exciting ride through love and danger,This was a great read for suspense and romance lovers. LC Martin has created an exiting adventure with true to life characters. Great Job!
5,classy quality,I was pleasantly surprised at the quality & classy appeal of this set. I purchased 2 sets and immediately put them in the guest room. I would buy again and for the price they are a steal
2,not good as expected,"This product is not that good as the one seen in the image. Don't keep lot of expectations, i found even better deals with good quality in other online shops. If you are looking for a luxury look comforter then this not the right one for you. This is for regular use only..."
5,CHANGED MY LIFE,"After spending the last 35 years with fine-but-thick, bleached-and-frizzy hair, I finally have a product THAT WORKS, when I want to either crunch curly or blow-dry straight. The summer frizz is gone. I am happy."
3,Bedhead,Well not to crazy about this product it's very sticky and hard to get off your hands water water water!! I sold the other bottle I got still using it once in a while I love BedHead products but this one not really
5,great,"smells like blueberry, its great and keeps your hair clean for about 2 days so youll havo extra time in shower cuz theres no need to clean it every day or two"
3,"It is good, but not great as I thought.","My friend introduced me this producte. She said it was great for curly hair.But after I used it, I found that my hair was not so shine as usual, but it did keep my hair good stlye the whole day."
5,This product is great!,This product is great! It does everything it says it will do. The fragrance is lovely too! I have recommended this to many friends and they agree their hair looks better than it ever has. I plan to buy this product again and again!
5,A kitchen must have,"This aluminum jelly roll pan works great for cookies and other things in the kitchen. I have about 8 of them. The really hold up well compared to other bakeware I've used and they don't brown the bottoms at all. They are a little on the expensive side, but well worth it for how long the last and hold up."
1,Big Louie Strikes Again!,"Do yourself a favor before watching this steaming hunk of (...) and hit it with a hammer: HARD. There, now you've saved yourself the pain of sitting through 90 minutes of Lou's *ahem* FANTASTIC FIGHTING which includes 1)punch 2)half-arsed kick 3)ELBOW SMASH!!...and let's not even talk about anyone else in the movie. Lame fighting scenes, lame acting, lame plot. Now, where's my painkiller...?"
1,Not for Administrators in a Corporate environment,"If your need is a ""classroom in a book"" on basic command line operation - then this book may be for you as it is filled with examples and labs (although $... is a bit steep for the privilege). However, administrators in corporate environments will find the book too simplistic for their needs."
4,If you've always wanted to learn DOS....,The book is easy to follow and the hands-on exercies really help solidify the concepts in your head. HUGE book - how many pounds does this thing weigh? A must-read for those who've never used DOS but want to learn.
1,WindowXP Command line is Dumb,"Ok from an IT and fundamental stand point this has to be the biggest book printed about the most unused subject in IT. First of all if you are learning XP command line your wasting your time. While it still is used by some people it's pointless. You would be better spent learning UNIX of Linux and then figuring out how to do it on Windows. See UNIX, LInux and many other main stream OSes use the same commands. Windows does not. They have made you unlearn everything you know about commands to do it their way and their way is of course the wrong way ergo this book is of course useless and even in some cases makes you do things the long way for no apparent reason. I needed this book for college and had to buy it. It's a huge waste of any geeks time."
4,A Solid Start,"For some reason, I really like this CD. I agree with some of the other reviewers that there is no real hook and that the songs are not very memorable. But, something still draws me to the music. Maybe its the musicianship and the interesting compositional style. Or maybe its my unspoken desire to find a modern band in the style of classic Yes. Whatever, the reason, I somehow like that this CD is part of my collection. And, for now, that's good enough. I look forward to seeing what these guys come up with next. For Under The Sun, their second album will likely make or break them. Here's hoping they make it a good one!"
5,Now and Forever,"I was fortunate enough to see Under The Sun live at NEARfeast (North East Art Rock Festival)along with several other great prog artists, Porcupine Tree ,The California Guitar Trio with Tony Levin to name couple.At the time I was only familier with them VIA magazine articles and interviews. They struck me as very articulate and interesting.Live these guys pretty much blew up the stage. What a performance. The rythmn section was absolutely acrobatic! Not to take away from the guitar work by any means, Chris definitely has a command of his instrument.I did end up purchasing the CD (and meeting the band!) after the show (sorry Amazon)Spread the word! Get Some Sun!!!!!!!!"
3,Under The Sun - self-titled (Vinyl Tap) 3 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1979,as far as I could tell,this may have very well been the UK band's only lp.Best described as progressive pop,with a psych element intact.I thought the song structure sort of reminded me of some of the late poet/songwriter Robert Calvert's better work.But,that's just me.Best cut here is ""Species Deportation"",a tune about how Earth should maybe relocate to space(or something like that).Other good tracks are ""Scorcerer"",""Sun Hole"",""Time No Time"" and the band's namesake ""Under The Sun"".Notice the vocals were actually pretty good.Line-up:Andy Baker-flute&vocals,Rob Cairns-guitar,Howard Grigg-rhythm guitar,Paul Jackson-bass,Neil Griffith-synthesizer&piano and Steve Price-drums&cymbals.Check it out."
2,The Difference Between Great Music and Great Musicians,"Probably the saddest aspect of prog rock music is the often poor translation between excellent musicians and the music they compose. ""Under the Sun"" are undeniably superb musicians and the production is flawless. Unfortunately, the music is unimaginative in terms of a melodic line or thematic development. If listenting to well executed songs by excellent musicians is enough, you may actually enjoy this group. The difference between Under the Sun and prog groups such as Jadis, Spocks Beard or Oblivion Sun is that the later groups write memorable music that gets under your skin."
4,Generally solid...,"Like others, this CD reminded me of certain other albums I've heard; for me, it was somewhat reminicent of the Kansas albums during the later Steve Walsh years. There's a good mix of hard guitar sound and synths, and the quality level is highly professional. I don't know if this particular album will get a lot of radio play, since I don't think there's a top-40- friendly song in the collection; at the same time, I don't know if I'd label them ""progressive rock"", either.Regardless, there's clearly a lot of talent in this band."
3,Weak songs played by strong musicians,"Having been a fan of progressive music for some time, I realize there are albums that need to be listened to a few times before they can be fully appreciated. But after having listened to Under The Sun for at least ten times, their music still does not appeals to me as much as I expected. From a musicianship point of view the album is flawless, however their songs lack character and strength. Under The Sun's music may have a lot of elegance, but it doesn't have a lot of passion.There is a lot to admire here, I just don't think this is an album that can hypnotize or captivate your mind."
2,very boring...,"the truth is that in my personal opinion this is a very boring cd,. other reviewers seem to have liked it a lot, but unfortunately I can't share that opinion, the vocals are very bad and lack power or feeling, the music itself may have certain interesting complex parts but is not melodic at all, I regret having bought this cd, maybe just for my particular taste its not good,but for others it may be..I think you should check out Shadow Gallery or Ice Age instead."
2,Too many bogus reviews,"If you notice that most all the people who give this five stars, this is their only review. Bravo! If you also notice these five star reviews all get approximately the same number of helpful votes. Bravo! It's obvious these are bogus reviews, and I agree with `progger88', that these reviews and votes are from friends, family, or the band mates themselves. Yes, they are entitled to write a review like anyone else, but I find it hard to believe this is their real opinion of this disc. This is not a bad album but not a good one either. The music is prog-ish with leanings towards hard rock or metal. The players are decent, the vocalist is different (not my cup of tea), but their songs don't impress me. I've heard this style before, but done better. If my predictions are correct, I'm assuming about a dozen not helpful votes for this review."
2,OK freshman effort...,"With all due respect to the glowing reviews here, this disc has alot of the plodding styles that modern Rush and Pink Floyd have fallen into. While the singer's Ozzy Osborne-like wail and occasional instrumental flourishes were amusing, it was hard to come away from this music with a memorable hook. OK prog, but there is better out there."
1,Bored To Tears,"I dont know. I tried to get into this cd thinking it would grow on me, but it just left me flat every time.I honestly ended up giving my copy away.Taking into consideration that this band has supposedly been at it for twenty five years, (as one reviewer mentions) the music and lyrics sound extremely juvenile to me. It just bored me to tears.It's not a terrible cd, but I would have to disagree with the majority of the rave reviews.On that note, I also have to wonder how many of the more positive reviews here were written by friends of the band, or even by the band members themselves. I myself would not recommend this cd to anyone.I would on the other hand, highly recommend another California based band, Cairo.Unlike Under The Sun, This is a REAL progressive rock cd from beginning to end."
1,OH MY GOD...WHAT A NICE COASTER,WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP THIS IS....MEANDERING SONGS PRETENTIOUS LYRICS A VOCALIST THAT SOUNDS LIKE HE JUST CAME FROM THE MICKEY MOUSE CLUB....COVER ART THAT LOOKS LIKE A PILE OF DOG CRAP..... I MEAN IM A PROG-HEAD BUT THIS IS SOME SERIOUS JUNK HERE!!!! 16.99??? I OFFERED TO PAY THE GUY BACK .30 CENTS FOR THE BLANK CD HE GAVE IT TO ME ON AND I STILL THINK IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH
5,Something new under the sun!!!,"This band from LA brings a new sound to proggressive rock. A 4-piece, consisting of drums, guitar, bass, and keys, they all write (and write well) _Seeing Eye God_ has one of those hooks in it that will find you humming the song for days after you first hear it. Their music is somewhere between prog and progmetal, with complex themes and instrumentation. Guaranteed not to disappoint!"
5,A wonderful masterpiece,"Wim Mertens has composed one of his very best works. You can listen to this album over and over again, and you will always find a new melody that captures your heart. Some moments are of pure magic, and show this man is absolutely gifted. You won't be disappointed!"
1,Outdated & Poor material,"I really waste my money in this very poor DVD material.To benifint from this material you should be a person who is a dummy enough and don't know what is a car look like! or at very best this DVD is a very basic video explanation for the meaning of ""Car Detailing"".My advice, don't waste your time and money with this material unless you are comming from Mars and need to know what is the meaning of car detailing!"
4,Great Band,"Great album. Be sure to check out their complilation CD, Spectators of Life, which I like even more!"
3,carpe the diem!,"whoa nowwhere's the wang chung?I, for one, am offended.eh, what the hell.3 stars.I'm in a good mood."
3,What kind of soundtrack forgets one of the main songs?,"I was disappointed. Being an Old97s fan, I was excited to hear them in the movie. Even thought of getting the soundtrack when Weezer and Jimmy Eat World were played over and over in the movie. But that's all this soundtrack has going for it. The CD is plain disappointing when one of the main songs from the movie (Old97s) isn't on it at all."
3,Whats the name of that song?,What is the name of the song that is played through all the romantic scenes in Mexico.... it is also played on the juvebox.
5,good movie good soundtrack,if you liked the movie you will like the soundtrack...everytime you will listen to one of the songs it will remind you of the movie. the soundtrack is full of songs for all the ages...remember only buy the soundtrack if you liked the movie...personally i saw it 3 times in a row!
3,Get it for the Eve 6 track.....IT ROCKS,"Ok, first off I don't think this is that spectacular, but the Eve 6 track makes it worth buying for me. In addition, the Andrew WK, Sum 41 and Jimmy Eat World songs are pretty good as well. Oh yeah, so's Lit. Bottom Line: Get it....just."
3,previous review: a.k.a. how to cry while living in the past,"guess what, kurt cobain is dead. the foo fighters are a seperate entity entirely, and their song ""win or loose"" is a nice departure from their usual not all too disimilar from ""i'm on your back"" from the x-files soundtrack. this soundtrack is nothing special but it does have its moments and the music will be better for you if you've seen the movie (i've seen it twice: great fun) definatly worth the cash."
4,Jenny at Dinner,I am looking for who sings the song when Jenny is stood up by Rick at dinner. I have heard of it before but i cant think of the name. And is this song on the cd? Any help would be great
3,Out Cold,"Hi there, I'd just like to say a few words on the ""Out Cold"" OST. I hope you don't mind. First off the movie was awesome and the producer really had an inside view of what snowboarding 20 somethings listen to when he chose the tracks for the CD. And second, I definately recomend picking up the movie and the soundtrack. That being said, one of the key tracks from the movie was left out of the soundtrack. Weezer's Island in the Sun cannot be found on the album. I dont know if it was left out because Weezer is not on the label that the soundtrack is on or if the person in charge of mixing the cd thought that it didnt mesh well its not my problem. I just think that if a song is in the movie it should be on the soundtrack. But I could be wrong."
3,Where's Jack?,A good movie with a great soundtrack....to bad the soundtrack is not well represented on this CD. Most of the songs that played in the movie were from Jack Johnson (if you haven't checked him out yet GET ON IT). I think they played at least 6 different songs from Jack (some of them not available on his CD) and the one they chose for the Out Cold CD is already on his Brushfire Fairytales CD. Sad. And to not have Weezer on this is criminal.
4,"Found the ""Jenny @ Dinner"" song...","I think I've found the song some were looking for...Flake, by Jack JohnsonAlbum: Brushfire FairytalesIt's been awhile since I've seen the movie..if not it is still a good song."
4,Nice,"I liked this cd much. It was very delightful. Only, being the weezer fan that I am, I was quite distrot to find that Island In A Sun was not on the album. :( It's still a good cd. It's just not complete that's all."
3,Ben's Lesbian Chatroom Song Request,"Ben, the song that is playing when those dudes are in the lesbian chatroom is the Beastie Boys, it is on the cd ""The In Sound from Way Out."" That whole cd is instrumental tracks like that one, I am not sure about the actual name of the song though.About the cd, as everyone is saying, it is missing some of my top picks for the cd."
3,somebody help me out,"this is a pretty good soundtrack, but i really want to know the name of the song that's playing when pigpen and the weird dude are talking to eachother on the lesbian pornsite. not falling in love, but the funky instrumental that's playing before that one. please help me out."
4,Buy Me!,"This soundtrack is great! Eve 6 - Anytime has to be my favourite song at the moment, it's AMAZING. Another great song on the soundtrack is Lit - Lipstick and Bruises. Sum 41 - Makes no difference, is also excellent. If you liked the film, you'll probably like the soundtrack just as much!And to the lady who can't figure out the song; I think the one your thinking of is SirMixAlot - I Like Big Butts"
3,-,"i'm really disapointed that they didn't put WEEZER's Island in the Sun song and the Baby's got Back by Sir-Mix-a-Lot [but mostly the weezer one] on this album but other then its awsome!yeah to everyone, the rap song is BABY GOT BACK by SIR MIX-A-LOT its an olldd song hehe and yeah cuz i notice ppl are like asking about it so yeah"
4,name of that song?,does anybody know the name and artist of the song that plays when inga walks into the bar?please help
4,WHAT IS THAT SONG??,"WHAT IS THE SONG THEY PLAY IN THE BACKGROUND WHEN THE BLONDE GETS STOOD UP FOR DINNER, I DONT THINK IT IS ON THE SOUNDTRACK?????"
4,Fits the movie,"I think that this soundtrack accomplishes its purpose. The music on it does a great job of representing one of the funniest movies in a long time. The soundtrack is full of great songs that capture the energy of snowboarding and drinking. Overall, I have to say that I'm glad I bought this CD and I'll buy the movie as soon as it comes out too."
4,"Somewhat repetitive, but pretty detailed","the book could get very repetitive when giving recipes about the fish on sushi parts, but there was also a lot of variety in working with sushi"
3,Not Enough Information,"Theis review is not a criticism of the music which is of the highest quality and sounds excellent, but of the sparse nature of the liner notes. Yes, they reveal that Valerie Simpson sings on most of ""Easy,"" but they do not say which songs she sings. If she doesn't sing all of the songs, who does? Is it Tammi, or someone else? If it is Tammi, when was it recorded, and are they true duets, or did Marvin overdub as he did on the second album? Motown also provides a list of backup singers, but fails to indicate who sings on which songs. In this day and age of endless repackaging, there is really no excuse for omitting detailed track information."
3,Some bad songs,"The first CD is great, the second one, not so much. Tammi Terrell really had something off. There are some pretty bad songs, but good collection"
3,This DVD covers only basic obedience.,"Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't list very much information about this DVD before you buy it. I was under the impression that the DVD was about teaching service dog skills. The DVD is actually about how to teach basic obedience skills (sit, down, stay, walk on a leash) if you are in a wheelchair or have otherwise limited mobility. The cover of the DVD doesn't really make this clear either.I'm sure it's very helpful for people looking for that sort of thing, but it wasn't what I was after. I've watched the whole DVD, and it's good, but my dog is already trained in all basic obedience, so it wasn't useful to me. Apparently the ""Teamwork II"" DVD covers the sorts of things that I was interested in. Just thought I'd post a review to make that clear to other people looking to buy this DVD."
2,For the handicapped??,"While I thought the DVD was informative. It did not have captions, therefore anybody that is deaf or hard of hearing is unable to hear most of the DVD. I don't think a DVD that is geared towards handicapped people and does not have captions is pretty worthless. For the price of the DVD the publishers should have thought this one through. If you need captions, DO NOT BUY this DVD."
5,Perfect...or at least a great start!!,This is the perfect DVD for basic obedience training for a service dog. I think sometimes we try to go straight for the SD assistance exercises and the basics get short-changed ending up with a dog that's not under good control (I learned this the hard way). These guys have a new DVD now with captioning for the hearing impaired - good for you guys!! I enjoyed this DVD alot and think it's a great start and was very professionally done. Good job!!!!
1,Can't review what I have not received!,"We were looking forward to trying to teach our dog a few things to help our disabled teen.This was the first thing I ever ordered from Amazon, and I never received it.I was afraid to ever order anything from Amazon ever again, but have since had nothing but good service from them.So I don't know what happened....was it the maker of the book or Amazon that caused the problem? I am definitely afraid to order the book again! :("
1,didn't work,I recieved the first one and try to play it and it didn't play in either my computer or my dvd player. I sent it back and got another one and it had the same problem. We never did see it.
1,Dissapointed,"It's a shame that whoever did this DVD missed the opportunity to do something right. Many divers go to the Bay Islands and there is a lot of information on books and the internet, but no DVDs showing the beauty of the islands both above and under water.This is more a commercial add for the Dolphin Experience in Roatan. Having watched THE COVE, and being aware how much dolphins really suffer without their freedom, I'm not interested.There are so many other things to see and do on each of these islands (too many to describe in an Amazon review) it almost seems that the people behind this DVD went out of their way to create something mediocre. To top things off, the background music is pretty bad.The sad thing is that they did have a pretty good cameraman and excellent video equipment, which makes it unforgivable to have done such a bad job."
5,A must,"Mysterious, evocative and haunting. Takes ""Jewish"" music to a new level of depth and expressiveness. Must be heard to be appreciated."
4,Beauriful,"Simply beautiful.So beautiful, I am relunctant to write in it.When the moment is Zen, I will."
1,Disappointing,I ordered this journal over 1 month ago and still haven't received it. I've also wrote parchment Journals and they never replied. I will probably never order from them again. I am deployed right now and we look forward to mail but this was just a bad case of customer service.
1,Completely useless...,The top falls off--almost from the start--this happened with one I purchased some years ago as well--pointless to try a third time--is there less than one star?
1,Worked great for half an hour,Worked wonderfully well giving good steam for 30 minutes before stopping forever. Then I threw it away. Now I'm looking for something that doesn't break as easily.
4,Mabis Steam Inhaler,"My ENT physician recommended this make when she told me I should be using a steamer for good vocal hygiene. It arrived quickly and in good condition, and once I figured out how to make it go, it worked as advertised. Produces a good steady stream of steam, very warm. The manual could have been more specific about identifying all the parts. It also assumes you know what a steam inhaler is for and how to use it therapeutically. This model allows you to use a saline solution or an aroma therapy solution instead of plain water, but it gives no information about what you would use either of those for or whether they should be breathed in through the mouth or the nose."
1,Mabis steam inhaler,"This steam inhaler was totally useless. I got more steam from the hot water faucet. Returning it immediately, won't buy another product like this ever again online. I wish I had read more reviews before I made the purchase, the good ones simply don't apply to me, mine had barely any steam."
2,Big flaw,Poorly designed top comes off much too easily which can result in dangerous spills of scalding water.Although this item produces a good amount of steam it should be used very carefully because of the design flaw.
5,Steam Relief,"My throat and lungs are prone to illness in dry, cold climates. Whenever I feel the dryness coming on, I use my steam inhaler. This little product provides relief and benefit as it creates steam in a minute which can easily be inhaled. You feel the relief instantly. I've had this steam inhaler for a year now, it's simple to use, reliable (sporadic use), and relatively easy to clean."
3,<1 year and not working,We used this product about 10 times. It has sat unused for about 6 months now. Started it up the other day and it is not working.It was good while it lasted. Since I am still under warranty (1 year) then I'll go try to hunt down that fix.
3,Pretty good,"I have never owned a steamer so I have nothing to compare it to. After using it a few time the plastic smell it has has gone away, and it seems to be easier to use. At first I was burning my nose. I set the steam control switch to the up position and now I can put my nose right into the mask.My biggest compaint and why I gave it 3 stars is because the top of the unit simply falls off every time I use it, and there is no way to secure it, so I have to hold it very carfully when using it, seems like a design flaw."
1,IT LITERALLY BURNED THE S*** OUT OF ME (Can't believe I had to give it 1 star in order to review)),"Ummm.....It broke while I was using it and shot a sharp stream of boiling water at my lip and chin and yes there is a burn that I will have to be worried about for awhile at least. I just looked on the mabis website and they make the same sort of things for kids. So that being said they will be receiving a call from me very soon. I wouldn't really be that worried about it if the burn wasn't on my FACE. I hope there won't be any medical cost. Not sure if I'm the only case, but DO NOT BUY. I would post pics of the burn if I could, but I don't see the option."
1,Never Worked,"I have terrible sinus infection's and at the time I purchased this I was so sick therefore I purchased this item. I paid extra to have this items shipped ASAP - Immediately after receiving I opened it up, reviewed the instructions & plugged it in and WAITED & WAITED for something to happen, no light came on - I then reviewed the troubleshooting area's - Basically it NEVER worked - Don't waste your money or your time, I finally received a FULL REFUND from the seller. VERY UPSET, as I still need something, But I wouldn't recommend this product."
3,"Effective ,but flimsy design and my unit stopped working after 1 week.","Yes Sinus problems are awful but just after 1 use I felt better , only thing is this unit is not that sturdy, it stopped working after 1 week, I am currently waiting on a replacement, if it happens again i will have to search for a different brand. After the replacement this unit started to rust on the inside not to mention that the parts can come apart in the middle of treatment and I got bad burns more than 2 times from this model.I had to purchase a different model elsewhere , although steam helps sinus's a great deal this little device has too many design flaws and does not last."
2,Not Much Steam,"I wasn't that thrilled with this product. I don't think it puts out that much steam, nor is it hot enough. I think the hot steam vaporizers put out more hot steam than this. I was quite disappointed. I expected to see hot steam billowing out of this machine that would really clear out my sinuses."
1,Defective,"When I plugged the unit in, the light went on for a few seconds and there was a vague warmth at the base, then it died. Permanently."
1,Mabis 92-741-000 Steam Inhaler Product Feedback,I am not happy with this product. The steam flow is very poor and there is no benefit I got using this product which I expected as per the product feature
3,Mabis Steam Inhaler,"I bought this Steam Inhaler for my wife who suffers from MCS or IEI (depending on your perception of this complaint.) She has not used it much as yet so I cannot say whether it is helpful or not but I am concerned that others may fall into the same trap as I have done. Nowhere in the specification for this item do the manufacturers (or retailers) mention that it is rated at 120volts. One might have assumed it obvious, as the goods come from the USA, but I, in my innocence, never gave it a thought. I would have expected the supplier, knowing the goods were bound for the UK could have issued a warning. So you will need a transformer probably costing anther 50 at least. Also be prepared for the addition of 20% VAT - another 10. Never have I been more aware of the term 'caveat emptor'."
3,Is hot steam actually good for your nose?,"This inhaler does seem to produce lots of very hot steam, but is that actually a good thing for your nose? If it hurts maybe it's bad. If you do want to use it, it is awkward to adjust with its loose fitting parts."
1,Mabis Steam Inhaler,This is the WORST design possible. I've purchased three in the last three years. The last one spilled on my leg and I got second degree burns. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,MABIS+MENTHOL CRYTALS OPENED MY NASAL/LUNG PASSAGES,"I had been looking for an aroma therapy solution to use with my mabis steam inhaler. My wife bought some menthol crystals. I melted some menthol crystals in heated water (after I let it come to a good boil then filled the aroma therapy chamber w/ 60ml of the solution; ONLY USE A LITTLE BIT OF MENTHOL CRYSTAL, NOT MUCH!) Almost as soon as I started using my mabis steam inhaler w/ the menthol crystals solution, it seemed as if my nasal/lung passages started opening up instantly.AGAIN, IF YOU USE MENTHOL CRYSTALS IN THE AROMA THERAPY CHAMBER, ONLY USE A SMALL AMOUNT. TOO MUCH WILL CAUSE A STRONG UNCOMFORTABLE BURNING SENSATION IN YOUR LUNGS AND NOSE."
5,Great product,This inhaler is the first I ever used and I was very impressed with the amount of steam it generates. I am very hopeful that it will cut down on my calls to the doctor for antibiotics when my sinus problems act up.
5,Mabis 92-741-000 Steam Inhaler,This Mabis Steam Inhaler REALLY puts out the steam!I am very satisfied and would heartily reccommend this item to anyone looking for a steam inhaler.
1,Could not open aromatherapy compartment,Aromatherapy compartment got fused together with the main body of the inhaler after first use. Bad Chinese plastic product - no quality.
5,Nice Steam,"I have been using this unit since I bought this one (like 3 months back)I waited this long to right this review, so I'll know any drawbacks.Pros1. Packaging and Shipping - Well packaged and came right on time2. Usage - easy to use and easy to maintain (cleaning etc)3. Steam - Steams in 1 min and you get lot of steam.4. You can put any oils/perfumes in the front compartmentConsWater Compartments are little smaller in sizeI want to give 4.5 stars only for that reason, other than that is a 5 star for me"
4,Good steam inhaler for the money,"We have used our new Mabis Steam Inhaler for 30 days. The product warms up fast and creates a safe steam my young children can use. Our only minor concern is that, if you pick up and hold the unit by the top half (or breathing tube) it falls apart. We have found that our Mabis needs to be on a table top for safe use."
5,Steam inhaler,Quickly produces steam. Love the angled spout which provides more comfort when using the inhaler.
2,limited,"this item produces too little steam, and more importantly, even adjusted (to longest mask) the vapor is too hot. the facepiece easily comes loose - not broken, but simply too easily detached."
1,lili,"I have read a lot of good reviews for this product, and I decided to purchase it. After receiving this product and using it for several days the pieces of the plastic part start falling, and I was not able to close the top. Anyway I had to return it."
1,Good only while it lasted,"The plastic casing cracked in several plasces by the time I used it a dozen times. Once the plastic tab that locks the upper & lower halves to each other broke, I could only use it while carefully holding it together. After doing that a couple of times, I decided the risk of getting burned wasn't worht the benefit.But it did work wonders...while it lasted."
1,NO CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Don't buy this product. There is no customer service. I called the customer care number: 800-622-4714, but no one answered. I had to left a voice message telling them to call back with my phone. No one ever called back.Don't buy this product! There are better and cheaper brands out there."
4,Good lil steamer,I use this thing to give myself a weekly facial. The steam was really coming out of there! Clean up and maintenance is also very easy. I'd recommend.
4,Heavy,"This is one heavy album. Full of energy, great loops, crisp breaks, what more can you ask for? Definitely worth a purchase; get involved."
4,"Captain, it doesn't even look real.","This episode has always been a favorite of mine. It is one of the weirdest episodes, but it will keep you entertained. Even though the alien parasites look like egg omelets with blood on them, they are still kind of scary.The ending to this episode was funny. If Star Trek had been canceled after this episode, it would have been a cool way to go out."
3,This episode gets a C+ grade and is ranked 47th out of 80,"Arriving at the planet Deneva, home of Kirk's only brother Samand his family, the U.S.S. Enterprise picks up a transmission from aDenevan pilot who has steered his craft into the sun to destroy some unknown menace."
3,Poor Quality!,"I was so excited to get this bike for my son. He had always wanted a Mongoose. I purchased it as a Christmas gift but unfortunately he couldn't use it until there was no snow on thr ground :( The FIRST time he rode it, the derailler broke. I called Mongoose and they said there was nothing I could do about it because it was 6 months old (again this was the FIRST time we could use it because we live in MICHIGAN).We ended up taking the bike to a bike shop for repairs and it ended up costing us $75.00.My son prefers his OLD bike to this one now and I need to just get rid of it.It is poorly constructed and not what I expected quality wise overall.Amazon.com on the other hand is great!! It arrived in 3 days AND I got free shipping!! I buy everything on Amazon!!"
3,bike review,"timely shipping. made in china, poor quality, poor assembly instructions. Item did not last the summer before breaking on my son"
1,Worthless,"Cheaply made. Self destroyed in the first ride. Rear shifter got caught in the wheel, spun around and bent everything in the process. Returned."
1,baddest bike ever,stay away from this bike its a very bad bike it came with no pedals no seat i had an extra seat that i was able to use for this bike and i had to order new pedals because i didnt want to deal with costumer service my son used the bike for 2 weeks and it broke down complete brakes were bad couldnt adjust them and the gears broke the bike is in a very bad shape and its only been 3 weeks so im returnig this bike back to amazon i hope i get a refund
1,Poor Shimano Equipment,"I purchased this bike as my son's 2012 Christmas present. He probably has less than 1 mile on it in 45 days of use. The Shimano equipment is the poorest I've ever seen. I should have listened to previous reviews before we bought. I finally took it to a bike shop, spent $60 to have it fixed, and they said ""nope, it can't be fixed"". The rear derailleur continually goes to positions it shouldn't go and hangs up in the back spokes. The chain comes off every 15 minutes, and the rear hanger is bent. I'm a road bike guy and have ridden 1000's of mile on Shimano equipment...but DON'T buy this...go elsewhere. I'm working on returning the bike and buying a Trek."
3,"Great performance, poor recording","This must have been a great show. The band is tight. It's wonderful to hear Rickie in a live ensemble setting. Her voice is strong and lovely. This would be a favorite CD of mine if not for the quality of the recording itself.I enjoy ""raw"" live recordings like those from bands like moe. But this CD could have used a scrubbing in post-production. It sounds like a bootleg. And that would be okay, too, but for the too frequent dropouts in the left or right channel (really noticeable with headphones), and the subtle but all too present hum of the amplifiers in the background.My advice is to check out this recording for yourself before buying it. You may love it. But it left me feeling a bit annoyed and disappointed."
4,Rickie Lee Live,"Excellent sound although a bit too much of the audience for my taste. But hey, this is a live CD. There are about ten additional Rickie Lee Jones songs I wish would have been included which is a testament to her genius. But it is a good overview of the breadth and depth of her work. Can you imagine anyone today producing the level of work she (and Joni, Laura, and Carole) produced? Think about it, her self-titled debut, followed by Pirates, The Magazine, Flying Cowboys, and Traffic From Paradise. Sometimes I feel it is so defeating that no one seems to care or is listening and then I hear ""Horses"" in Jerry McGuire or ""Stewart's Coat"" in a Meg Ryan film and I then realize, it's getting out there. Good work will always find a place. But then again, I like having her all to myself. To those who only know Chuck E have really missed an incredible talent."
2,the label must have made her...,"This is rock star Rickie. Loud crowd noise. Overproduced pop hits.If you want the radio version of Rickie Lee Jones, by all means, be my guest. But if you've bought her last five CDs and prefer the introspective, thoughtful, clever and occasionally disturbing Rickie Lee, then you really need her acoustic live CD.It made me sad to listen to this, because I can't image that RLJ really wanted to make this CD. If she did, I can't wait to hear her next studio CD, which I'm sure would be both a crowd pleaser and insightful. As it is, this belongs on Top 40, I'm afraid."
4,cute!,"Cute pendant, but it did NOT come with a chain as described in the description. I think only pendants with the title indicating a chain will include a chain.Also, because it's hollow, there is a tiny hole on the bottom, but it's not noticeable when wearing.The other problem was the bail which was too big for the pendant itself. The back of the bail bent and it fell off the chain. I had to replace it with a smaller ring bail. Other pendants have more permanent sauderized bails which won't fall off. But this was a cheap pendant and you get what you pay for.Shipping was very quick, and I still recommend ordering from them."
1,Didn't work for me.,"I was excited when I saw that this solution would keep my goggles fog-free. Unfortunately, having used this repeatedly, I can see absolutely no difference in my goggles. Save your money. In my opinion, this doesn't work."
2,Antif fog for swim mask,"This product worked fair for my swim mask, it was'nt long before the mask fogged again."
1,Aqua Sphere Anti Fog,I applied this to my Aqua Sphere goggles while swimming indoors and after applying the product as directedmy goggles have fogged up worse then they did before I applied this product.I am very dsisatisfied and feel this product is a hoax. If there are certain conditions when this wouldn't work then the customer should be told in advance.
1,Hmmm - not quite sure about this ...,"I dunno if i'm not using this stuff correctly or not, but my googles still fog up?? Ive read the instructions over and over, but no joy ?"
1,Doesn't work,"I've had much better anti fog stuff. I swim 2-3 times a week and I've used a bunch of different stuff. If you want something that works, don't get this stuff."
2,it's ok,"was a little disappointed. worked for 2 weeks, reapplied, and didn't really help after second application"
1,Doesn't Work,"Just bought and used in Tulum, went through application process diligently and the product just doesn't work."
5,DEAR EMI: COPY PROTECTION PREVENTS PLAY ON COMPUTERS-DO YOU HATE YOUR CONSUMERS?,"1. I LOVE Kasey Chambers2. I am unable to find the live and unreleased b-sides that she releases via EMI Australia import via American releases, so I am forced to buy ""copy protected"" CDs (URGH!)3.Come on EMI...wake up and smell the coffee..it's 2005...you wanna know why the music business is in the toilet? Because you are WAY OUT OF TOUCH with how your customers listen to music (on their computers).4.If you wanna truly break Kasey and other artists....why make it so difficult for people to hear and buy the music?"
3,"worthy, but a challenge at times","An intriguing overview of how Glasgow has been portrayed in fiction, specifically those works set in the city. Burgess traces not only the stereotypes and truths presented in novels and short stories, but the public and literary responses to them. A reader unfamiliar with the works she discusses will get their flavor through excerpts and the author's commentary. However, this book is intended for a local-ish audience rather than an international readership. Those unfamiliar with Glesca vocabulary will be mystified by ""kenspeckle"", ""gallus"", ""douce"", etc., and a surface knowledge of Lowland history, while not required, would certainly be useful. If there had been a glossary, I'd have rated it 4 stars, because the book is a fascinating portrait of how Glasgow's social and cultural evolution has been reflected in literature of all stripes."
2,Don't grow in humid climates,"I thought this would be a great educational Christmas gift for my sons since I thought the plant would be low-maintenance and hard to kill, even if they forgot to water them. The fern did unfold and turn green, which fascinated them. However, even though we rinsed them and changed the water daily, within 3 weeks both plants had developed white mold (FYI, we live in Georgia). We plan to plant them outside in the yard (after I check to make sure that's legal) so the mold doesn't grow in the house. Definitely NOT low-maintenance, and not for homes with high humidity/mold issues."
3,Doesn't look like picture on box.,"I do think this is a cool product... but doesn't look like the picture on the box. I actually bought it for myself as a conversation piece for my desk at work. I'm horrible about remembering to water plants so it's perfect for me. It does open up and do what you'd expect - but the picture on the box is a lush green plant... and in reality, it's a flat brown plant. The first few times I watered it, it looked greenish, but now it just unfurls it's ""leaves"" and stays brown. I would still recommend it bc it's interesting and inexpensive, but does not look like the picture."
3,Not impressed,"it didnt grow.. it unfolded...seemed a little ""over advertised"" I wouldnt say false but definately made it seem more than what it really was..."
2,Dinosaur plant,Plant turned green first then turned brown after a couple of weeks. Dealer said to let it rest then water it again. It is resting now.
2,Not what i orderded.,I ordered 30 year anniversary dvd with extra footage. They shipped original edition of dvd. I allready own this edition. Not what i expected to happen. The pic and description said 30 year edition of dvd.
3,Swim Goggle Case,This fits the Aqua Sphere Seal XP Swim Mask well without bending it so it can keep its shape. Only 3 stars as it could be redesigned to have a better closing top that would close more tightly so you could store keys in it while you are in the pool or earplugs/nose plug when you get out. The current opening leaves large gaps that the small items can fall out of.
3,"Too big for goggles, too small for swim masks.","This case is slightly too big for my swim goggles. I can actually fit an adult- and two kid-sized goggles in it. One pair of goggles sort of bounce around inside the thing, and could fall out of it if the Velcro weren't adjusted properly. But it's convenient, and has a nice clip with which to hang the device from my swim bag."
3,Should've been designed as a hard case to protect the mask.,"Although it fits my Aqua Sphere Seal mask, it doesn't provide protection due to the soft case design. They should've made it a hard case. I have better protection from the original resealable packaging of the Seal mask & doubles as a protective hard case for my prescription eyeglass when I'm using my Seal mask at the beach or swimming pool. The only minor plus side to it is that you have the option to clip it to your bag."
2,too small,"I couldn't get my mask in this case. I'm sending it back. I do not have a large mask, it's average size."
2,"Great bag, just NOT worth the money!!!!!!","I got this bag, and was very excited. All my friends loved it, and so did. BUT, I have used this bag for less than 6 months, and it is falling apart. The leather handle started to peel away, which I have glued now twice. I even went as far as taking it to a leather store, to see if they could fix it. The guy said it is only bonded leather, and it is going to continue to do what it is doing. Then said, I hope you didn't pay alot of money for the bag. I didn't reply. IT GETS BETTER, the other day, one of the metal studs by the handle fell off, and I can't find it. So I have this hole by the handle now. If I knew it was going to do this, I would have never spent the money. And I would NOT spend over $100 for it, it should be less in my opinion."
1,What purpose does it serve?,"After installing these it looked great on the car, but during the first rain it proved to serve no purpose. As installed per instructions (I understand there is room for error but this isn't my first deflector install), windows can not be left cracked if there is even a chance of rain because it'll just rain into the window. I bought this for somebody else, they like to keep windows cracked to smoke when it's raining, unfortunately for her she can't even get fresh air when its raining unless she uses the dash vents to get exterior air. Again, it's a 1 star because it doesn't do what it is intended to do."
4,"A pre-Catch-22 WW II story: comic, tragic and ironic.","Great book but not perfect. Story follows fellow (named Turvey, Private Thomas Leadbeater) from enlistment at the beginning of WW II to his dischargment at war's end. Through seemingly unending bad luck (and lots of strange but funny mishaps), he unwittingly misses a personal introduction to the true horrors of war: death, maiming, injury and depravation. Seeing these horrors pile up around him (the death of his best buddy, the maiming of another, etc.), the comic becomes tinged with the tragic. Like Turvey's perpetual grin, Turvey avoids the morbid by exposing the absurd of army life with a good-natured smile,and yet the same exposure brings to light his growing disgust of war. By war's end, Turvey wants out as badly as he wanted in.Really a good book. Won the Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour (1949)."
4,another mis-marketed film,"This is the second film I watched this week that was mis-marketed with a misguiding box cover and press. Variety is neither a ""a Daring Departure Into the Dark, Obsessional World of Female Fantasy,"" nor is it a""sexually-charged tale"" in the sense one thinks of sexually-charged tales. It's intent is not to titillate.It's a character study and a very interesting one. I see parallels here to Taxi Driver; a depiction of urban (NYC) alienation and isolation and an individual's reaction to their environment. Here the character is turning to sex instead of violence. Which is to say Variety is not a sexually charged tale, in the same way Taxi Driver is not an action movie.It's cerebral, character-driven, meditatively paced. It's not Scorcese ...but ... it's not boring."
4,Female Gaze,"A must for anyone who loves avant-garde author Kathy Acker since she wrote the script. The book centres on the world of pornography and draws an interesting feminist critique. Many film critiques deal with the ""male gaze"" but this film centres on the ""female gaze"": the protagonist's objectification of the men who are objectifying her by their pornographic interests. A long, slow meditation this film inverts male-female power structures and gives one a non-sensationalized look of the hegemonic male world of pornography. The film does aptly well for having been shot on a shoe-string budget, and the soundtrack is by the same guy that did Jarmucsh's ""Down By Law."""
2,Not Good,"This was a late night purchase when I was lonely and on the road. Very sexy synaps and photo. I thought this would be something that might help me relieve myself watching, but instead it put me to sleep. There are absolutely no nude women in this movie at all."
5,Excellent introduction,"This book allows a person with a general technical background to quickly grasp the fundamentals of wireless (cellular) communications. The book does not go into too much detail, but the main idea is always clearly emphasized. The author's intellectual curiosity and sense of humour make this book fun to read."
4,Very good anthology,I really enjoyed this anthology. Shannon McKenna's story is her first and I look forward to reading her next. Suzanne Forster's story was well done. My favorite story was Lori Foster. Somehow she is able to write both long books and shorter stories for anthologies without losing her wonderful voice. Thea Devine's story is not for the gentle reader.
2,Very Disappointing,"If you like romance with a touch of the erotic, you're going to be very disappointed by this one. The first two stories are awful, even though they are by some of my favorite authors. The third story is ok, but not erotic by any stretch. Only the last story lives up to its advertising. It's HOT.So my recommendation is skip this one entirely, unless you don't mind losing money on 3 out of 4."
1,Bad,A cop investigates the disappearance of a Japanese tourist and finds it becomes very personal. Terrible acting and stupid story that I had to fast forward to get through.
1,Misleading product,"I had ordered a different cable then what they sent me. It will be a big time drain to send this back and get Amozon to fix this situation, I am very displeased. I do not have time for a while to get what I wanted and have this refunded, in the meantime I do not have the equpiment I originally intended to purchase."
3,Not as advertised,"I purchased these soup plates to replace four clear glass soup bowls I have which are 9 inches in diameter. I just received the shipment of the 12 soup plates which are slightly less than 7 inches in diameter. They were advertised as being 8 inches. I'll probably keep them even though I would have preferred a slightly larger bowl for soup. The seller should offer a more accurate description of the product, including the outside dimensions and capacity."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was expecting a light, shallow story about fashion and life in the city judging from the title and the cover, but I was pleasantly surprised to discover there was more than met the eye to this story about two women who are forced to move from the city to the country and inadvertently start up a successful natural cosmetics business. Okay, maybe the author(s)-- it's actually written by two women under a joint name -- spends a little too much time describing how they get the ingredients for their cosmetics; the British slang is a little hard to decipher; and the ending is less than satisfactory. And they have an annoying habit of jumping ahead in time without letting you know until later on in the sentence. But all in all it was a good attempt at describing what life is like for working women with young children and portraying the bonds that can develop between women. An above average ""chick lit"" book."
2,WHAT?,BORING book! I can't get past the first 87 pages because it is going sooo slowly. I tried to continue reading but it is tooo boring. I don't know what the other reviews are talking about!
3,Library Checkout,"I really do not know what to say about this book. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. It was certainly not a light fluffy novel about fashion as I thought from the title. It was a great story of friendship, but the story dragged big time in places, and there was not a very clear plot. It is certainly not a horrible book, but it isn't good enough to be a must in anyone's collection. I'd recommend checking it out from the library if you insist on reading it."
3,Funny Chick Lit,Better than most other chick lit stories out there. Has some unexpected twists. Quick fun read!
1,I spent 15 bucks on this?,"Ordered this movie and thought it was supposed to be a decent film. Wrong. The seller was great but this is one i should have watched because someone else rented it. I should have saved my money. Watching it is like watching a home video that uses three different scenes, the kitchen, the living room and the front yard. Acting was very poor and ""where is all the lesbian action""? more about a lonely woman that gained a lot of weight and was miserable so she ate more. She happened to know a girl from school ten yrs prior that happened to be gay. Very boring. I dont expect porn or even make out scenes but the story was SLOW, boring and not a gay enough story line. I mean i'd like movies like Kissing Jessica Stein, Chutney Popcorn, The incredible true adventures of two girls in love, The Journey, Treading Water, DEBS, Claires Moon, Aimee and Jaguar!!! The Gymnast, Gray matters. All these were worth spending my gay dollars on!!!!"
3,clear movie,wasn't what I was expecting but the movie was in top shape no glitches in the movie at all thanks
1,One of the worst lesbian slanted films ever,"I considered buying this film but then decided to rent it instead. I am so thankful I did that. My partner and I endured this film to the end. She got up about a 1/4 of the way through and I made her sit back down. It really took all my strenghth to actually watch it to the end. This film is about two high school friends,who we are told shared a kiss at some graduation function. 10 yrs pass and they meet up again on the premise of a reunion. Their lives took extremely different routes but neither ever got past the moment they shared. Blah Blah Blah. They fight almost continuously from the moment they reconnect. Then after all is said and done they part ways again mysteriously healed. Absolutely lame, should not be listed under gay and lesbian catagory. Its really about to friends who really don't know one another."
3,Rent this one if you can,"I was looking forward to this one, especially since I'm an aussie, I was expecting a little more, but ended up somewhat disappointed. Everything about it was ..... bland, but then again I suppose that's life for most, it's quite ordinary. It was good to see two lead actresses who weren't godesses and a storyline which was believable, even if painful at times."
2,What happen with the quality?,"If you take-off the remix of Thievery Corporation it will be difficult to have a positive opinion of this CD. Maybe you can be hooked if you know the taste of Sola Rosa or the talent of Peter Kruder(producer of one track) but this is not a good dub selection. The other four sessions were better in all the senses.It's the fist record of Guidance that I do not want to recommend,well, a black point in the superb catalogue of the label."
1,I was disapointed,The book rambled and got off track often. I would have liked more practical and useable information.
1,Disappointed,I found the book to have only basic information that I had already read on my own from the internet. It didnt give you any insight to anything. You can get this information for free. You dont need to buy the book
2,DISAPPOINTING,"This book was not as I expected. It only explained how the credit agencies work, not much info on how to actually repair credit and did not give many examples on which forms to use or the procedure for removing negative information. I almost sent it back for a refund."
2,"Much theatrical & musical presentations, much advocacy","I expected a travel video of the same quality I'm used to seeing, and was quite disappointed. Much time is spent on small, not very professional theatrical and musical presentations, some on politics with an interview with & presentation by the then president, some with the ministers of information (tourism) and economic development. Oh, yeah, some time is spent on the forts and castles built by the Europeans for the slave trade. Much of the narration and some of the interviews are not very audible, and Glover pronounces ""personify"" PER-son-if-y!"
4,Good stuff.,Although Mr.Wolf may be past his prime on this one there's still more than enough fire in his belly to make these songs fly. Apparently there was some friction between Wolf and the english super star rockers during the recording of this cd? And at one point you hear Howlin belittling Eric Clapton by telling him all ya gotta do is count it off? Some great moments on this offering and for my money Highway 49 tops the bill here. Although Sittin on top of the World and Poor Boy ain't half bad either.
3,Buy only the album,"If you are into big name rockers playing together with master bluesmen, then this album is a must for your collection. Eric Clapton and Hubert Sumlin provide super guitar chops. Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts provide the backbeat on a host of tracks.You may not find anything extra-ordinary here, but Howlin' Wolf's brilliance comes across in snatches.Stick to buying the single edition album and not the deluxe edition or the rarities edition."
4,Great Intro. to The Blues,"If you like Classic Rock and Roll and are looking to get into The Blues this is a great place to start. Chess Records, in following the success of Fathers and Sons, ships both Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters to play with a who's who of British Rock. On this album, Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Charlie Watts, and more accompany Howlin for a set of his classic tunes. While this may not be Howlin Wolf's best material it is still fun. The take out of Little Red Rooster is great where Eric and others try to talk Howlin into play along. Steve Winwood really shines on this album. Howlin while not at his peak is still a force of the blues. This is a great place to start and a great way to get someone into the blues. Won't spare the expense of the delux version."
3,"Primitive, powerful.A tribute of Rock greats to a Blues King","I must admit this sounded better on a scratchy record in 1973.Of course, we were all younger and less sophisticated and a whole lot higher."
5,The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions,"In my efforts to replace my vinyl LP's with CD's - this was a treasured LP, now a valued CD."
4,An intro to da' Wolf,"This is album/CD for white kids who think that they might want to listen to some real blues. Wolf is pretty good but sounds aged. Eric Clapton, is his usual, well, overrated self playing a whiny style riff that lacks power. (However, in all fairness, this is, in my opinion, Clapton's second best recording ever. See John Mayall's Blues Breakers.) It is apparent from the recording that the backing musicians know they are in the presence of a great blues man and strive to be worthy. For the most part, they turn in a suitable performance. The one real gem on this record is the outtake on Little Red Rooster. If you want an intro to da blooz, this is a good starter. Then, go get the real stuff. Get Wolf's original recordings with a real blues guitarist, Hubert Sumlin."
4,Blue-eyed Bluesmen workin with the Real Deal,"Howlin' Wolf / The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions featuring Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts (Gold Disc with 3 bonus tracks): While this is not the classic sound of Howlin' Wolf, it is Wolf's chance to play with the kids of rock, and the kids chance to play with another great Blues legend. The rock legends play with restraint and respect and Howlin' seems to enjoy the reverence they give to him. There recordings are also filled with respect and restraint and so the songs never reach full steam, but they are a very good set of songs and very enjoyable to listen to."
4,Wang Wang Doodle,"After the success of Muddy Waters'Fathers and Sonsalbum, Chess Records decided to do something similar with Howlin' Wolf. So, they got young rock stars like Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts to record with Wolf. The results were good, although not as good as Wolf's older recordings. Practically all of these songs had been recorded by Wolf before, in better versions. Wolf's voice was not quite as strong as it once was, and the younger musicians didn't quite mesh with Wolf as well as the old bluesmen he usually worked with did. But this is still an enjoyable album that blues fans should enjoy."
2,Quality of Product,"After I purchased the product & downloaded it to itunes, the sound quality was not good at all.I have the product on wax in an album form, but as you know after a while they lose quality from use. This is why I choose to purchase it from you guys thinking it would be a good quality digitized product.The products I've purchased from Amazon in the past have been wonderful."
3,Worth the money,"Cover collections are never a sure thing, but with the artists enlisted for these tracks I guessed correctly, the CD was worth the cash."
5,Good rechargeable,"As I've said in another post, I don't really like Sony products (my preference) but I can not complain about these batteries. I have about 16 of these and they all work great, along with the Sony charger. Use them in my camera, remotes, and other electronics. Great NiMh battery!"
2,Why don't they keep a charge for long?,I bought them to replace the ones I got with my Sony Sureshot camera.. Yet they don't seem to last as long as the original ones that came with my camera.
5,Great batteries,I bought these to use in our digital camera and have not been disappointed. A single charge lasts for 150 photos. The batteries have had regular use for nearly 3 years and have only just recently started to show that they were not holding a charge for as long as they used to. Pretty good IMO!
5,Sony rechargeable batteries are the best!,"Fast and easy! Properly packed. Sony batteries are higher power than the ""name brand"" 2500 mAh. Last longer per charge."
5,Best deal for the buck,Purchased these and Energizer rechargables last year. The Sony are still going strong vrs the Energizer. Highly recommended. I use them for my digital camera which are notorious for draining batteries. 1 full year and still going strong! Get them!
3,Great when newly charged,"I have owned these for about four months. Mostly they are used in a DSLR camera.I find that, when freshly charged, they are superb, giving lots of life and fast performance in the DSLR, which relies heavily on good battery power. They also charge fine, with no memory problems, in the Sony charger.However, these batteries lose power when not in use. Most AAA rechargeables do, of course. But there are a new sort on the market that minimize the power drain when not in use. I have tried some, the eneloops.They are just plain better than these Sony batteries. Eneloops fire right up and last longer even when they have not been in use for days or weeks. I find this makes a big difference because I don't have to recharge every time I start out a day with my camera.Hope you find this helpful."
2,average,"I sae this image and ordered , it was different battery of sony and not the shown image one so I returned."
3,not so much in the picture,"Not so much in the picture.Sent battery gray that come with the charger {Sony Cycle Energy Power Charger with 4 2500 mAh AA Batteries}.That is, the previous version.In principle, good battery.&#1057;harge about 2100-2300 mAh."
1,Unreliable,"I reached into my camera bag yesterday to replace the 4 AA batteries in my Canon camera. I had 2 sets of these Sony batteries in reserve, and all were unusable. If these batteries cannot be stored, what use are they? I have Power 2000 and CTA batteries (both sets purchased from Amazon) and they perform better. I thought the Sony brand would be a step up, but I was wrong."
5,Great product.,We had purchased the 2300 mah version with charger 3 years ago. We needed some more batteries that were compatible with charger. These 2500 mah work fine with the existing charger we had.
5,Long lasting great quality,These batteries last much longer than any other recharable batteries I have purchased before. I purchased the Sony charger and have many of these 2500 mAH batteries to go with it.
5,Great batteries,"These are excellent batteries. The NiMH batteries in general are great, but these seem to work a little better. It's hard to say. I've been using these batteries for about a year and I haven't had any problems. I've also been pleased with the performance but I don't run any battery benchmarks so there's not much else to say."
4,Seem to be working fine,"I've only used these batteries for a short time, but they seem to be charging and working fine."
5,Very good batteries,"I have only had the batteries for a few weeks, but so far, they are definetely lasting as long as I wanted. Seems to be a good battery."
1,Sony 2500 AH AA Bateries,The batteries were a good brand but they will not run the solar lights all night like they should. The originals ones did for almost two years. These failed the first week so I would never buy these. They were 2500AH and the ones I relplaced were only 600AH.I spent $30 bucks for nothing as the new ones will last half a night.
5,I think they're good,Works for me. Takes a while to charger with some chargers but so far so good. Decent amp hours. Can't complain
5,great long-lasting rechargeables,I use these batteries in my canon 430ex flash unit and I am amazed at how many shots I can get out of a single charge. I photographed nine football teams in one afternoon (team and individual pictures) and never had to change my batteries and I used the flash (as fill flash) on each and every picure. I'd highly recommend these to anyone needing reliable batteries that last a long time on a charge.
2,When compared to Sanyo 2700 there is no comparison,I have 12 of these Sony batteries.I got them without checking out the reviews.Then I got the LaCrosse battery charger which allows you to charge at different rates and actually see how much the milliampHour is stored.I also read the reviews and got interested in the Sanyo 2700.Bottom Line:If you are uninformed you will like the Sony'sI regret purchasing before becoming informed.Take note that there are two typesRechargable around 2700 maHandPreCharged around 2000 maHThe PreCharged will hold self life over a year from what I have read here.Don't waste you time with anything besides Sanyo.You're on your own now...at least you have been informed.
1,Horrible at maintaining the Charge,"I got these with the charger I bought. These are horrible at maintaining charge. I have a pair of Sanyos which I use to and Once fully charged they retain charge for a week or two at least. Not these though, even refreshing before the charging has no effect on the outcome. They may keep the charge for 1-1.5 days at the most which I think is pathetic performance for 2500 mAh batteries. Am staying of these."
4,Ok so far...,I use these in my Sony Remote Commander and recharge them every month or so. The regular carbon-zinc batteries last only two or three months. I have saved a bundle already!
5,Works great,I use it for my Wii remote controllers. It has good battery life and charges quickly. I think it would be suitable for a camera flash as well since it has a high 2500 mAh.
3,Dead in under a year....,"When I click on the item page, Amazon reminds me...""You purchased this item on November 29, 2007""The batteries died today.Not even the La Crosse BC-900 I used to charge these things with can bring them back to life.As others have stated, the new hybrid batteries are the better choice anyway, though think twice about buying these in particular.I'm GOOD about not using crummy chargers and using these batteries in a reasonable manner (digicam, xbox controller, GPS...etc.)These weren't fried in a 15 minute charger or shorted out in faulty equipment. Buyer beware.I'm giving them 3 stars because they did work for a while.I should have been able to get another year or so out of them though."
1,Drain down to 20% in a week unused,"I use AA rechargeable batteries in my Aviation Headset.Rayovac, UltraLast, and now Sony. A pair of AA's would last about 4 days of flying, and most of my trips were 4 day trips.I bought the Sony because they claim a bit more charge (2500mAh) than the others, thinking I'd have a better chance of them making it through the 4th day of flights.First time I used them. Fine. Second time, maybe OK.But then I started noticing that these ""charged"" Sony batteries would only last thru the 2nd day of flights.And if I had charged them a week ago (sat unused for a week) the would be discharged within a few hours of use.I love the Sony Charger that came with them (charges 4 independently) but the batteries are pathetic.Your electronics are great, but when you buy batteries from an EOM and put your name on them, you'd better start doing your homework before selling them to your customers.Sorry Sony, your AA's get an ""F""."
4,batteries on time,these are really good rechargeable batteries and no complaints at all.try them and you see very good quality performance from your equipment.
2,"1st ones were good, these are not",This is the second time I've bought these batteries. The first batch are about 2-3 years old and won't hold a charge at all. These new batteries do not hold a charge for as long as the first batch; maybe 2 days. I do not recommend these batteries.
2,Battery Performance,"My son's school science project this year was to test a set of rechargeable batteries. He conducted two tests on Duracell, Sony, Energizer and Lenmar: 1. Long term storage test where the batteries were fully charged and stored for two weeks before measuring the voltage. 2. Capacity test where randomly selected two batteries were fully charged and put on a regular flashlight until a complete discharge happened. The first test was inconclusive. He repeated the capacity test mutiple times and the clear winner was the Energizer NH15BP-4 and the Duracell came in second. BTW, the manufacture's claim on the overall capacity was not even close to the measured capacity. This Sony battery was the last one. It performed consistenly without being overcharged, but the overall capacity was not very good."
5,"Great product, decent price","The batteries recharge great. i only use for my remote controls so cant say how good they work with digital cameras but have charged them with my energizer charger and they took about 8 hours to charge, i then kept them plugged in for weeks before using them for my remote controls and the remotes have had them in there with no problem for months now."
2,Poor Battries,"Brought these four batteries from amazon, they are under performing batteries. They drain out too quickly. Have some old rechargeable one which perform better than these new ones. Will look into another brand.thanks-"
2,Many Failures.,I have bought several packs of these batteries and have seven batteries that have failed so far. They are good to start with but after a couple of charges some of them seem to fail. I am using a La Crosse BC-900 charger.
2,Beware! it is 1.2volts NOT 1.5volts,I bought the Rayovac PS3 charger and two of these 4packs of 2500mA AA Nimh batteries by sony to work with it. My son's RC toys use most of our batteries and that was the main purpose of this investment. I discovered that these batteries (like most other Nimh rechargeables) are 1.2volts and not 1.5volts required to run RC toys/synthesizers/ other battery operated toys. These are useless for me! I need to buy 1.5volt rechargeables.
2,WHY INCORRECT ADRESS DESCRIBED?,"I DON'T RECEIVED MY PRODUCT YET, AND THE TRACKING SYSTEM SAY ""INCORRECT ADRESS"". HOW THIS ADRESS IS INCORRECT IF I BUY ANY ITENS SAME TIME AND ONLY THIS PRODUCT SAY IT?"
4,Good batteries,"Not opened them yet, since I got the charger/batteries package and they are still going on."
2,Pass on This one,"I reviewed this one somewhere before and I got a hate letter (the battery company, not Amazon)from them saying that it's my fought for not reading the small print about shipping and the fact that they send it via regular mail at $10.00+. (They said Amazon told them how much to charge for shipping; yea yea sure)Only restraint on my part kept me from answering them."
1,Why pay more for SONY name? Batteries made by Sanyo,"Well, I hate when companies try to profit off a brand name, and not off inovation.I think SANYO should be given the credit for the performance of these batteries, after all SANYO makes them, then sony puts their label on it and jacks the price up.Check out the Energizer E2 batteries. Also SAYNO rebrands, and much cheaper.Anything that is made in japan and 2500mah is made by SANYO.Be wary of batteries made in china that claim extremely high ratings. Most of the time, they dont perform as advertised. I spent lots of time looking for excellent quality AA batteries, and anything made by SANYO seems to be the best."
1,Will not charge after only 6 months of use,Sanyo Eneloop are the best and somewhat expensive - but worth it. Amazon Basics are decent and priced right. These Sony rechargables are garbage - don't waste your money!
5,Excelentes y buen precio,"Las compre para los controles del WII. Hasta ahora están funcionando super bien. Muy buen precio. Tengo pilas recargables de otras marcas que ya no sirven, pero tengo otros juegos de pilas recargables sony y todavía funcionan perfectamente."
2,Sold as 2500 mah but only 1950 to 2150mah,"I bought these about a year ago and have used them about 10-15 times. I just bought the MAHA 9000 charger which allows for a complete break-in cycle which actually measures the capacity of each cell.I've cyled all of them a few times and found that the MAHA rates them between 1950 and 2150. I've got 12 of them and none rated higher than the 2150.They work well and seem to supply power well, but if they are sold as 2500mah they should provide that much. If you don't mind the lower capacity they seem fine, but you'll have to recharge them more often."
2,No flattery for the batteries,So far I'm disappointed in the batteries. They don't seem to keep a charge very well. Maybe it's the camera but I find I have to bring extra ones with me to an event like a party. I'm not a big picture taker so I think the batteries should last the whole event but they don't. I'm stuck with them now so I'll have to make the best of it. The charger does work well though.
2,Sony Batteries dissapointing,I fully charged a pair of these AA Sony Batteries and used them in my small flashlight. Was very dissapointed in that the batteries did not last as long as I expected. It was about 1/4 the time that regular Duracell bateries have lasted in the past. I am not sure they are worth the money.
5,Very nice quality and long lasting,"I have used these for about a year and during that time these batteries have held up well. After many chargings they still come close to their rated capacity. Do yourself a favor and use a ""smart"" charger."
4,An Endless Dream,"As with most products these days by the time I make an honest appraisal it's already replaced by the manufacturer with an upgrade or no longer available. However, I can say of this product that since receiving these batteries six weeks ago and fully charging them then placing them into my wireless desktop, digital camera and mini-disc player that they have yet to require recharging! In my digital camera they give me clear, crisp and vibrant pictures frame after frame. In the mini-disc player and wireless desktop they seem to be endless at this point and here I better stop to leave well enough alone... Hope this helps!"
3,not impressive,"I mainly use these on my camera flash, i dont take lots of pictures with flash, but i think these are ok.one thing i'm not happy is they are not low discharge, i placed them in my drawer, full charged while they are not being used. however, after a week or two, I will have to recharge them before use."
3,not so good replacement,"This rechargeable does not last long. I have to recharge it almost every other day after 30 to 40 shots with flash. The original sony rechargeable batteries used to last very long, but this one just lasts a quarter of original sony batteries came with camera. It's not that cheap but feels like I got what I paid.Not so much recommended but just better than nothing."
3,"Great at first, not so reliable in the long run","I sometimes use these for weeks in the camera without having to change them. I've been using this brand and model for several years. It took over two years for the first set to wear out (and not hold a charge well).[UPDATE]. After using these batteries for over a year and a half, I find that many of them died prematurely and won't hold a charge more than a couple of days. I switched over the Eneloop and have much better results."
1,Junk,"Do not buy these batteries for a camera. They state that they will work better than regular batteries, but after I charged them they only took 5 or 6 pictures. I recharged them and the same thing happened. Maybe I just received bad batteries, but I would rate them as junk."
5,Back in business again.,"I have tried several different brands of batteries for my Sony digital camera and they were just not holding up very long, especially when I would use the flash. For a while I thought my camera was defective, so when everything else fails, read the manual. Of course Sony will recommend their own line of batteries so I purchased this item to see how they worked. They are great!The camera now works like it did when brand new. I have not kept track of how many images I can take before I need to change batteries, but I would say that it is at the maximum as listed in the owner's manual."
2,Loose power,"I bought these rechargeable batteries for my digital camera. They loose power very quickly, even after fully charging them before use. My very old Panasonic rechargeable batteries last much longer than these new Sony batteries do. I will not purchase them again. Maybe they sent me some very out of date batteries."
1,Works ok.,These batteries are not for use in a high drain camera or flash unit. Buy the Sanyo 2800 mah batteries for that. These are ok for low drain use.
2,These don't give more life than alkalines.,New to the rechargeable game and read that certain ones gave more life than alkalines. These do not.
1,These batteries are garbage.,"Based on the stellar reviews on Amazon and the 2500mAH capacity, I decided to get a couple 4-packs of these over the eneloops that most photographers rave about. I have tried using these rechargeables in camera flashes, but also point & shoot cameras and other things that take AAs. These don't hold a charge at ALL once you put it into a device. After even a day of just sitting, the batteries lose their charge and you have to recharge them. These are junk, get eneloops."
1,Never held a charge properly,"I got these to replace some old worn out Sony Batteries, but they wouldn't hold a charge overnight. I think they were old stock. Sent back to Amazon for a refund, ordered replacements directly from Sony."
4,Works as good as described,shipped on time...I bought it for my uncle and so far I havent heard any complain from him...
4,They didn't ship the batteries shown in the image,"The batteries are good, not 100% good, but they do what they advertise. I use them on my apple wireless keyboard and mouse but they they never show a 100% power, they alway star at 70% or so.My only complaint is that they sent me a different product as the one in the image. The product was with the same characteristics, but with a different package. This is how they look like: [...]It also had the holographic sticker, that proves its original, but still the batteries are different, they even have a Cycle Energy label."
1,Stale batteries don't hold a charge,"I was looking forward to a fresh pack of Sony's 2500 mAh AA Rechargeable Nimh Batteries as I had used Sony's 2500 and 2700 mAh AA Rechargeable Nimh Batteries with my Canon A710 IS in the past with excellent results. These batteries are usually fantastic and feature a high energy density and long lifespan, but not the latest pack I received in the mail. This latest pack won't hold a charge for more than 2 days (even without use) and can't seem to take more than a dozen pictures before the dead battery warning starts flashing and the camera shuts itself down. This is in stark contrast to the last pack I purchased that would hold a charge for 2 weeks and easily take 100+ pictures between charges. Needless to say, I'm more disappointed in the vendor than I am Sony as I know Sony can make a great rechargeable battery. Caveat Emptor, my friends."
4,Different than shown in image,Just got these batteries... Although these are 2500mAh but are not same as shown in the imageDont know about how these will perform but for excellent delivery I am giving 4 stars.
1,Crappy Battery,Batteries last 1/2 the time I replaced them with. The ones I replaced were over a year old and still lasted twice as long as these.
2,After some month you have to charge it the day you need it,"The title says it all. I have Varta batteries that have more than 5 years, and still work greate, every sony has now this problem, they don't last 2 days charged. Several (I have more than 20) at 3 month were useless, or at least that says the sony charger, where the LCD flash saying that you have to replace it. Go for eneloop instead of this one, or if you like sony, I believe that Sony has the equivalent of the eneloop. Ihave Sanyo eneloop, since one year ago, and I can use it even in a flash lite, where stays there with no use, but when you turn it on, it works!, you don't have to go to the charger and wait for having some light."
4,They work,"How do you judge batteries? They charge up, fit in the device and provide power. Haven't done any timed endurance trials so who knows if they have the rated power. Best thing about them was the free shipping."
2,Battery Life Doesn't Last Long,"Basically if you're paying a cheap cost for rechargeable batteries, you're getting a cheap product and cheap life. The battery doesn't last long before needing to be recharged again. I use it for my mac keyboard and mouse, and have to recharge it every week - 1.5 weeks. Not worth the frustration...."
1,rechargeable batteries,I used these batteries in 2 different applications and I didn't find them to perform as expected -- that from an degreed electronic engineer.
2,Disappointing Maynard Programmer,"""Phantom Thunderbolt"" (1933) promises more than it delivers - especially for a Saturday Matinee Western. The engaging exploits of Ken Maynard and Tarzan the Wonder Horse are hamstrung by a weak script and limited production values. There's plenty of hokey fisticuffs, but little of the traditional Maynard action. Stick with ""Tombstone Canyon"" or ""Come On, Tarzan."""
3,"not the best ""Hazar Fazar"" choreography","I first watched Raqia Hassan's choreography to the same music, which was fantastic and which I danced, so I wanted to compare and eventually learn a new version to dance it too some day but I was very disappointed. I guess it reflects the choreographer's mood and personality but this choreography looks messy and sometimes out of place, like when Nourhan uses her hands like guns that she pulls out of imaginary pockets and shoots! Not very tasteful for this classical music.A lot of people may find it overpriced, as other Yousry Sharif's videos.Otherwise the DVD is well made, with clear instruction, it is just the choreography that I didn't like."
4,"comprehensive, well illustrated","Discusses dance in colonial America, the 1800s, Loie Fuller, Isadora Duncan, Denis-Shawn and other early moderns, Black dance, foundations of American ballet, regional ballet , ethnic dances, the dance scene in 1976."
1,charger never worked,"I switched the charger to 220V and pluged in ,but never worked on 110V or 220V. Was a bad deal for me at least."
5,"Silver Wing was wonderful, I expected nothing less....","Silver Wing was wonderful, I expected nothing less from Cassie Edwards. I have read all of her Indian Romances. This particular book keeps you wondering what will happen next. I loved it, and if you like Indian Romance novels, you will love it to."
3,This is a game for beginners,"I think I am a little too advanced a bridge player to enjoy this game for long. It's fine for someone just starting out, but there are more sophisticated versions that are better-suited to someone who has my level of experience.I am by no means a master player and always feel there is something to be learned, but this is for players with a very low level of expertise.I bought this Used from Amazon, and don't have a lot of money invested."
1,Not for Windows 7,HOYLE BridgeI used this product with Windows 95 but when I upgraded to 7 it wouldn't work. The description given didn't say this so I was stuck with something that didn't work. However when i emailed Amazon about it they refunded my money. Amazing company.
3,Contract Bridge CD,"When I received the CD I played many games and all was well. When my computer with Windows XP died, I purchased another one, but it was Windows 7.Well, the CD does not work with Windows 7, so I can no longer use the CD."
1,Unable to view Hoyle Bridge,I have Windows 7. Tried to install this product. Was unable to install. Got message that this version was not compatable with my windows 7. Not techi enough to know what to do now.
4,Learning bridge,"Through my whole adult life people have tried to get me to learn bridge. I've finally decided to give it a try. The Hoyle CD is a good primer. I haven't worked my way through very much of it, but I'm beginning to get the hang of bidding and scoring."
4,Good Basic,This is an excellent game for beginner to intermediate players. It can be good practice for all or instructional for beginners.
2,Bridge game Sharif,I liked the graphics and the game overall with one exception. There were very few good hands dealt!. I liked it better than Hoyles.
5,Super wall unit,"Stores tons of papers & files, folders etc. Well made, steady, easy to mount with either suggested cubicle brackets, or to a wall with screws. Holds the most for the least money!!"
5,Buddy Products Mirage 7 Pocket Wall Rack,This wall rack holds letter-sized files and is devoted to my husband's paperwork and documents that he needs for his medical and other Veterans Administration files. It provides a handy all-in-one-place filing spot in our home office.
2,Seeing what sticks after thrown,"Lengthy 2000 release finds the highly experimental composer in full-out schizo-noise mode, providing more than a few compellingly abrasive textures though rarely anything musically cohesive past that."
2,Battery sucks,"After a few months, my battery life dropped to 5-6 hours, a tech at Verizon told me I could purchase a ""heavy duty"" battery for a mere $50 or so. No thanks: would you buy a car if the dealer asked if you wanted to upgrade to a heavy duty battery?Also, the touchpad on my chocolate goes brain dead intermittently, hope the replacement is better. In summary, I DO NOT recommend the chocolate."
2,For college...,I took the brita to college. It is not that durable. the filter is really slow. water tastes ok. it is kinda bulky for a mini fridge.
1,Drinking purified charcoal,"I followed the instructions exactly. Every pitcher of water (about 20 so far) has pieces of charcoal/carbon in it, mostly gathered around the filter in the top filling tank, some black ""dust"" smeared around the lid, and a few chunks at the bottom of the pitcher itself and in my water glass! I'm taking them up on their warranty, getting my money back, and buying a different brand."
1,I HATE this thing.,"First off, no matter how properly or carefully you ""secure"" the lid, you will often have it pop off, having water explode all over the countertop. Also, its filtering powers are overrated. After my girlfriend purchased this, I did some online research that only confirmed my own opinion. Thirdly, there are charcoal particles floating all around, from the filter. I hate this thing. Really.I'm going back to buying Crystal Geyser."
1,Poorly made.,"This basic pitcher was poorly designed and did not live up to its name. When you tried to pour, the lid fell off and made a mess."
1,Bad design,Whoever designed brita pitchers must re-take the design class. Period. The lid is so easy to fall off during usage. It falls into pieces from time to time.
1,Warning: Will probably BREAK if you try to clean it!,"Over the past 15 years I have used 3-4 of the original Brita pitchers that this ""attractive"" model is supposed to replace, so when it came time to replace the current one I bought this one. It *looks* like an improvement--at least aesthetically--but in reality this model is garbage. The plastic is so much flimsier than the old models, and if you take out the reservoir (standard cleaning procedure), half of the handle is attached to it, so you will be left with two parts (reservoir and basin) with flimsy ""half handles"" that are way too easy to break if you're hand washing. (I didn't even think about trying the dishwasher because it warped my last old-model Brita, and that plastic was much thicker.)Save your money for something better than this straight-to-landfill model."
1,black powder? Really?,"I spent for the pitcher and a 6 pack of filters only to come home and find I'm drinking black powder? Really? If you don't think it's there, pour it into a white cup and see. Let it settle and don't drink the last sip! After these filters are done a year from now I'm switching to something else. I hope Brita goes bankrupt."
2,Filtered water Still tastes like tap,"Recently bought the 10-cup large pitcher plus 2 filters from Costco with a coupon. Will be returning them. The system seems ok, but the main function and reason for purchasing this product is not satisfactorily met: the ""filtered"" water tastes close to exactly the same as from the tap itself, and you may wonder - the answer is yes we followed each step-by-step direction methodically. We thought perhaps give it a few times. So we dumped out quite a few pitcher-fulls of water in an attempt to see if it was just that the filter wasn't getting going. This wasn't the case.Too bad, the Brita water I tasted in a different part of the countrytasted well - and that may be more that their tap water tasted better. Disappointed. Will go back to refilling at the store."
4,Handy Dandy,"I am happy with this little pitcher. My previous Brita Deluxe pitcher was 10+years old, and I figured it was time for a replacement. I like the round shape of the Brita Classic. I don't keep my water in the refrigerator; I keep it on my kitchen counter. The Deluxe pitcher is heavier and actually a bit harder for me to handle with one hand than the Classic model. The Classic also has a smaller footprint on my counter. I have very hard water where I live. I don't necessarily use the Brita to drink water, as much as to take out some of the calcium and magnesium salts that destroy so much equipment where I live. I use the Brita water for cooking, pet water, my fish tank, plants, etc. I also use bottled water, but that can get expensive. I am very pleased with my purchase."
1,Brita 35548,"I read all the reviews and decided to replace my old Brita with this pitcher. The old Brita was many yrs old and finally a minute crack had become long and it was leaking. Unpacked this pitcher, washed by hand and started to dry it. As I am drying the pitcher, the handle cracked and now I am without a pitcher. Maybe it was a defect caused in manufacturing. I am glad that I did not have it filled with water. I will replace with Brita..have the filters and do not intend to waste them."
2,Typically lame A&E/History Channel hack job,"The list price of this is $24.95, but copies are available for $2. There's a reason for that $2 price, but I'd say that is too much to pay. I watched it included in the 2-disc set of The AviatorThe Aviator (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)and like usual, the people who did the disc pack it with inaccuracies and half-truths. Among their gaffes are calling Hughes ""the inventor of the seaplane"". Huh? Of course, I'm of an age where I remember when A&E; stood for Arts & Entertainment, before the channel became devoted to ""reality"" TV, and this is a perfect example of A&E;'s penchant for poorly researched so-called facts."
5,One of the best.,"THis was one of the most informative books I have read. I already knew a lot about the struggle for Irish Freedom and this book was packed with more first hand knowlege. A wonderful and easy to read book. It does get a little slow in spots but quickly picks the pace back up. A must read for anyone that is interested in Irish history, especially during and after the troubles."
5,Review of Rebel Hearts,"I have read many books on the struggles in Northern Ireland but this book stands apart from them all. Toolis has the unique ability to remain both objective and passionate about this topic. As the subtitle suggests he truly gets into the soul of the IRA. His book is based on research, interviews and perosnal experiences that could have placed Toolis himself in harms way. Some may see this as a weakness, but Toolis's conclusions are clear. Prior to reading this book I knew a lot of facts about the struggles of the IRA. After reading Toolis's book I suddenly understood some of what created and continues to fuel these struggles. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Irish History, the history of the IRA or interested in the violent struggles that mark the 20th century."
1,not even close,"the doll I received looks like someone took an Animal body and glued an Elmo head on it. Really, it looks nothing like the picture in the add. I am very disappointed. It was going to be a gift, but I just threw it in the closet. I would never buy anything from this source again. I spent 40.00 for a doll that looks nothing like Animal."
2,Skip This Book!,"Over the years I've been a fan of William Bayer's books and particularly his Janek mysteries. However, Mirror Maze is definitey a book to skip. The plot was much too disjointed, the characters (even Janek in thsi book) were mostly uninteresting and not very credible, and the action was too sporadic to make me care much about what was going to happen next. I felt like I was in a maze reading this book and all I wanted to do was get out of it so I can move on to my next book. Finally, I took the easy way out and gave up on the book about 2/3s of the way through it."
2,"Works, but over priced.","I found the same thing in a higher dose at my local grocery forless then half the price I paid for this. It does seem to work,but look else for it."
5,Great Product,This product is easy to use and works very well. Make sure you don't let the cord dangle from your computer. We have stepped on a few of these and broken them.
1,this sucks don't buy it,this piece of junk came broken first of all and second it was cheap plastic. You get what you pay for and don't pay for it like I did. Im never buying from this company again and i suggest you do the same
2,Shuffle Dock,"This is the third or fourth dock we have purchased in less than a year. They are not built very sturdy at all, and the pin coming up gets bent or broken easily. The shuffle is nice, though."
3,works but..,"Not the same quality as the original by a long shot. Do not like the fact that the plastic is colored blue - that was not in the description. It works though, and is a less expensive alternative to the original."
3,It is what it says it is,It sure was expensive for what it is... sadly it was just what it said it was- but there was NO Apple packaging anywhere...
2,IPOD DOCK,"Received Ipod docking station in a timely fashion, and am pleased with the product.It is in great working condition, and I have my ipod charged again."
2,"Okay product, ridiculous price","Given the amount of people who have had issues with these breaking (mine did), the cost for a replacement is ridiculous. At nearly half the price of a brand new shuffle, the cost/quality ratio is shameful."
1,"Bad Quality, screws with my computer","Really bad quality, cheap flimsy plastic. It also screws with my internet connection every time its plugged in. Spend a little extra to get a better brand!"
2,"Good item, terrible price","i think the dock has some good item quality, but the price is insane...come on. There is a item out there that is $5.oo and you don't need any cords. It connects the Shuffle straight into the computer from the usb without and necessary cords!"
2,Does the job but...,"$30 for this ""dock""??? PLEASE. That's almost half the price of the shuffle, which is packaged with the same product!!! 2 stars for a good product with a ridiculously bloated pricetag."
1,Apple iPod Shuffle Dock - Works but Overpriced,"The replacement dock provided by Apple for the Shuffle is as overpriced as the Shuffle is. This product does work, but there are alternatives ranging from 40 cents to $5 that will do the same job.This fills a product need created by Apple. If this was made better the Docks wouldn't break so easily. Normal USB adapters should have been included with the product instead of the mini-doc, or at least backup cables. A standard USB port connection could also have been used.Check out the alternatives which are much more reasonably priced.USB adapter for the 2 Gen Apple iPod ShuffleAPPLE Ipod Premium White USB Data / Charging Adapter Adaptor for Apple 2nd Generation ShuffleIncipioBud USB adapter for the 2 Gen Apple iPod ShuffleHaving a backup dock or adapter is a must for your iPod shuffle. It just doesn't make sense to buy this replacement from Apple.Good luck!"
3,Standard Apple Design...,"Sleek and what you would except from Apple, but watch out cause these things break easy. Very easy to snap off the connector and the base is somewhat awkward to stand alone on your desk when the iPod is not in the base. I agree it is a little bit pricy for 30 bucks, especially when you paid 79 for the entire iPod/Base combo."
5,IPod dock,"Have read other reviews that aren't favorable but this is the exact dock I used to have - at a great price and it works just fine! I don't use it a real lot though - have another dock for Ipod to play on so this is just for charging. However, I don't see how it can break - it isn't fragile!"
5,The right piece at last,"I had misplaced the charger for my IPod Shuffle my daughter got me a couple of years ago. I looked at local stores and even purchased the ""correct"" piece according to a clerk at a local store. It did not charge my IPod. My daughter suggested I order it from Amazon. I found it right away and my IPod was finally working again. Thank you Amazon."
1,cheap,"I had them a couple of months and they fell apart. The earbuds also didn't fit well either, but that became a mute point after they stopped working."
4,"Great concise book, not totally accurate however.","This book lists all Mauser made Lugers as having strawed small parts which is only partially correct. Many Military issue Lugers made after 1937 had blued parts. I found the remainder to be accurate, informative and especially concise. Provides a real benefit to the gun show shopper!"
2,Confused,I bouhgt this book because I am very new to Lugers. I should have read the reviews first. How can a book be rated at such extremes? Either great or terrible. Who do you believe?
3,"Good book, but ...","Este libro tiene una buena cantidad de informacion, pero le falta apoyo fotografico o dibujos."
5,Wonderful!,"I have ankylosing spondylitis and need to maintain flexibility to avoid further fusion of my vertebrae. However, due to pain from the condition regular yoga dvd's have not been helpful. This DVD was and is amazing. I've gotten my flexibility back and am now able to walk without pain. I attribute 50% of my healing to using this DVD 3 times a week. I would recommend this DVD to anyone with a muscular-skeletal condition."
3,Hoped for more from this dvd.,"This dvd is ok for Fibro sufferers, but not what i expected. I could not do alot of the dvd."
5,Great for Fibromyalgia,"I have fibromyalgia and that is the reason I purchased this DVD.It is very informative and gives detailed instructions on each stance and how to do it. It has soothing background music and is very relaxing.The poses are simple, but challenging.I also appreciate the fact that the instructor also has fibromyalgia, so she understands what we are going through.I highly recommend this DVD."
5,Perfect for getting back into the flow....,"I used to have a very strong practice until I became ill and have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. As anyone who suffers from fibro knows, the weight gain, pain, and lethargy are so difficult to deal with. I'm so happy I found this DVD!! I can practice again! There are several practices on the DVD, varying in length and what you are looking for out of your practice, either energy or relaxation. I'm so glad I ordered this, I hope to build my strength back up to be able to do the longer practices on the DVD. Highly recommend."
2,Led astray and let down,I was expecting a lot more from this DVD based on the reviews and the fact that it was priced significantly higher than others of the same description. The props used in the poses are difficult to find and also expensive. I will probably not bothering to view it again because of this.
2,Horrible,"I'm a pretty big Pigface fan, actually. And I expected that the quality of this DVD wouldn't be terribly amazing, but come on! my main beef was with the sound. People buy music DVDs largley for the music, you know? The music on this DVD constantly cuts in and out, twitches and skips making it moreless unwatchable (testes on 3 seperate players - just to make sure) Another beef.. The packaging lists two Public Image LTD covers under extras.. Those covers do not exist on this DVD. I was quite looking forward to seeing them and it was a deciding factor in my purchase...and they wonder why people download DVDs instead of buying..."
3,Good enough for die hard fans.,"Maybe I missed the point of the DVD. The titles ""Glitch"" and ""Son of a Glitch"" are correct if it means that this is super low quality DVD and there are many glitches that seem intentional. Maybe I just have a bad copy. But at least seeing Ogre and Reznor singing on stage made my day, that's the only reason this DVD got my 3 stars."
5,THIS BOOK HAS IT ALL!!,"This is truly one of the BEST books Ive ever purchased.It has information not only how the XBox was hacked buton FPGAs, Cryptography, fabbing PCBs, and so much more!And throughout, its beautifully written and organized.If Andrew (Bunnie) ever writes another book, Ill be the first to order!"
4,Good Reading,"Very good book if you are a beginner at computer/xbox mods. Need to have a little electrical knowledge to understand a lot of what is in the book. It is not a how-to book, but a book that will make you think and try stuff on your own. Lot of information on copyrights, DCMA and stuff like that. A great book to show how to get started, methods that can be used, and computer structure. If you are a computer wiz, then this book would seem basic, if not this would be a good book to read before you start hacking."
4,"Has a lot of Info, but is old","This book was published a couple of years ago, so it's problem is that it doesn't cover the newer 1.6 Xboxes and doesn't contain Microsoft Dashboard 5960 hacks. Otherwise, it's a wonderful book for someone looking to do something more interesting with their old Xbox, I mean, now that it's place is being taken by the newer 360."
4,hacking the xbox,"I did not read this book cover to cover, but its very insiteful is how to hack the xbox and possible other electronics. It's a more technical look in to what it takes to devise a hack. Interesting reading and an understanding of electronics and circutry is helpful."
2,Hacking the Xbox,The author tries to give a basic idea of reverse engineering but with gapping holes on code due to fear of prosecution from Microsoft; only a basic idea is given. If one would know the rest of the puzzle then one would not need the book.
5,very cool book,This is a very cool book with a tons of great xb hacks.You will love it and use it a lot.
3,"Fascinating read, short on actual projects","I purchased this book because I would like to learn about reverse engineering without getting a degree. Tinkering with an Xbox, which can be purchased for less than $50, sounds like a great idea. The book, sadly, is short on actual projects to learn from. The vast majority is about hacking, reverse engineering, and legal issues related to these activities. The book is well written and the arguments for the freedom to reverse engineer and invent in your own garage beautifully argued. It made for a really great read but left me wanting regarding the original reason I purchased it."
4,d/k why people don't like these album much,"i love these album,d/k why people weren't happy with it because its really good,refreshing,and different than her other ones.don't be scared go ahead buy it"
3,I agree with others,"I agree with others when saying the Album wasn't what I anticipated it to be considering her beautiful gift of song. KeKe is an awesome awesome singer. I really hope she has better people working with her on her sophmore album. She is way too talented to not have a #1 CD this time around. Ghetto Rose is a great song and I must say she sings the hell out of this song when she performs it live. I really hope she comes out on top because she definately has the voice for it. Maybe she should have stayed with Destiny's Child while she was with them. She could've been what Beyonce is today. Because she definately out sings Beyonce. There isn't too many singers these days that can compete with KeKe. That's with the exception of Fantasia and Whitney Houston, of course."
2,Why?????,"I am giving this CD 2 stars simply because there are only 2 songs that I care for on this whole CD... Self Explanitory... do not but this one...not hardly what I expected, especially after the song she did with Avant..."
4,This CD Is Worth Buying,"I would recommend this cd to any one who is into R&B music. The CD has some really nice tracks on it. I especially like the song she did with avant and the ""If Only You Knew"" (Remake). KeKe can really sing so if you like artist like Faith Evans,Blu Cantrell and Alicia Keys then I think you'd enjoy this album."
3,A Big fan,I think that CD is very good. Being from Indianapolis and knowing her makes it even better. My favorite songs are Nothing in this World and If Only You Knew. Everybody that was doubting her look at her now. You go girl
2,Soul Sista - actually 2.5 stars,"This is an ok debut. I was expecting a little more given the fact that I've only heard KeKe sing 'MY FIRST LOVE' with Avant and was impressed. This disc contains only 3 songs that really stood out to me: DON'T TAKE YOUR LOVE - showcases her beautiful voice very well; I CAN'T WAIT - she & Avant's voices really complement one another, their duets sound beautiful; CALL ON ME.Overall, I felt that the songs were too similar sounding and didn't make full use of her voice. The only other song that I can comment on is her horrible rendition of Patti Labelle's IF ONLY YOU KNEW - KeKe sang it in a higher register that was very unpleasant to listen to. It was almost like she was trying to sing it just like Patti does but she doesn't have the vocal skill or range of Patti so it sounded like a cat drowning to me. She gets ""props"" for taking on a legend but her version falls flat.I hope she gets to work with producers who can make better use of her voice for her sophomore set."
2,Wallows In Mediocrity...,"Ah well, I guess they can't all be winners. Too bad, but this lackluster collection further drives home the point that modern soul music, for the most part, stinks. The overrated, oversung and exhausting duet with Avant (another half-talent currently clogging up the music highway) ""Nothing In This World"", is the most tiring, embarrassing piece of dreck you're likely to hear this year and unfortunately you can't get away from it, but it, like the rest of this insulting 'product' can be ignored. Well, at least she's good looking (if still somewhat ghetto) so black audiences will eat this up."
2,Expected More,"When Ketara decided to release her debut album -=Soul Sista=- i was extremely excitecd. i took off all my clothes and did some self pleasuring.i was expecting more so i didn't push it to far after i got the cd but keke is weak. only a few good tracks, the only stand out one being ""if only you knew"" a remakei'll keep the close on next time and my fingers to my self"
2,keke wyatt,hey girl whats up with you me im doing just fine and i think that your cd is very good and i seen you on one o 6 aand park yesterday im a big fan of yours well have to go get back to me when you could
2,I'm glad this was on sale....,"... I don't think its her, it the material that she had to work with. Somebody with great vocals, should be singing songs where they can show off a bit. I think she's a terrific singer; but other than ""Nothing in this world"", she doesn't really get a chance to shine. Too often we go out a buy a CD because of that one good song on the radio and end up disappointed. Trust me, you'd be better off buying a single this time."
2,Disappointing,"This CD left much to be desired!! I purchased this CD because of her two tracks with Avant, My First Love and Nothing in This World. However, after listening to the whole CD, I immediately wanted to return it. She sounds like she was holding back from singing as well as I think she can. And in my opinion, her remake of Patti's If Only You Knew, was an insult. She should have left that song alone..."
4,Great listening,"I only heard 3 cuts from this cd, Nothing in this world, the re-make of Patti Labelle's If only you knew & Used to love me. I immediately ran out and brought the entire cd. I fell in love with the soulful voice of Keke Wyatt when I heard her on Avant's, My first love. Her voice is just another reason why I love r&b. I like the entire cd. She sings with feeling and a whole lot of soul. I just added her to the list of my favorite artists, which include Aaliyah, Faith, Mary J. Blige, Janet Jackson, Melissa ""Missy"" Elliot and so many more."
3,Good first effort,"Keke Wyatt's first album was very well done. Most of this album consists of ballads. I like Talkin' Bout Love the most and the soulful If Only You Knew. The reason I'm taking one star off to make it three stars is that sometimes the songs are too identical, that thump-thump-thump of Steve Huff's production so evident. Did Steve just go ""thump-thump-thump--that's a wrap, next song, thump-thump-thump--good, next song"" when he recorded Keke's album? I say that since Huff produced three different R&B albums in 2001-2002 for Avant, Sparkle and Wyatt. Entire albums of those three! And sometimes Keke's songs could have fit on either Avant or Sparkle's albums when you think that Huff produced some 30+ songs of nearly the same kinds of rhythms and beats. Sometimes there's a blandness to some of Huff's monontonous thump-thump-thump ballads that doesn't work for Keke. But Keke's strong singing outdoes whatever weak spots Huff provided to the project."
4,happy with the filer,we have been drink these filer water since 2009. the only bad thing is we would have no way to know the correct timing to change a new filter.
2,They've Downgraded the Product!!,"These used to say they filtered out cryptosporidia & giardia as advertised, but the package now says you should not use them in microbiologically unsafe water. Maybe they just changed the packaging in a CYA maneuver, but you can't advertise one thing on Amazon and another on the front of the box. Stand behind your product!"
4,could be better,"should last longer seems these new ones do not last as long as the previous ones I have purchased It is the system I have , so no choice but to buy these"
1,Arrived broken,"The PUR CRF-950Z 2-Stage Water Pitcher Replacement Filter, 3-Pack arrived broken. The blue granules poured out when I opened the package. My hope is that it will be replaced. I bought this item through Amazon. I have bought these filters from Amazon before, and they had arrived in good condition."
3,Not Up to Present Drinking Water Needs,"I've used this product for a long time, but now communties are increasingly faced with radionucleides in their water - such as URANIUM. Although, levels in most parts of the nation are low, with stastically low threats, and the EPA is watching it, some states like Texas override the EPA with their own water quality standards, and do not publish adequate, responsible information - like what should consumers do when we recieve such notices.PUR does not filter out what Americans increasingly are faced with, and it is wise to go to Reverse Osmosis -- buying bottled water does nothing to protect us, either. It's like another ""BPer!"""
4,"Clean, filtered water.",I can't get along without the Pur system. These filters were shipped quickly and are reliable as far as I can tell.
4,I thought they were defective,"I have two pitchers so when my order arrived, I opened two packages and found the filters to be moist. I've never noticed this before and was afraid to use them. I tried to call but it was late afternoon on a Friday and I had to wait until Monday to call again. I tried e-mailing.When I did call on Monday, I was on hold for 20 minutes before someone told me that they shipped that way. These filters are not cheap and I stood to lose 2 of the 3 had I waited the 3 weeks for an e-mail response.Maybe it's noted somewhere on the packaging that they ship wet but I couldn't find it. I love the pitchers but the customer service leaves a lot to be desired."
3,"Good product, got at great price from amazon","I have been using this product for more than 6 years. Good for household use. This filter has a ring with marker, which shows how much of the total capacity is used. As we use the filter, the marker moves and when it reaches the end, we need to replace the filter. Idea is good. This marker, as it moves towards the end makes the filteration slower. When it is around 2/3 level, it really starts getting annoyingly slow. We have to wait forever to filter few cups of water.You can cope with it if you fill the upper tank in the night or you have to replace the filter when about 2/3s of it is used."
1,Filtering slows to a crawl after 2 weeks,"I was debating between Pur and Brita when I was originally deciding between water purification systems, and I chose Pur. When my first Pur filter slowed to a crawl after about 2 weeks of usage, I shrugged it off as a defect. However, I am now on my second Pur filter, and it takes 10-15 minutes to filter through 20 ounces of water. I wish I was exaggerating, but at this point I am so fed up waiting for water that I am going back to Brita. Brita filters are cheaper too: 6 pack for $26.99 ($4.50/filter), compared to $19.99 for 3 Pur filters ($6.66 each)."
3,pur pitcher filter,"The current pur pitcher filters work well, but don't last as long as those that had the marker that let you know when the filters had been totally used up."
4,really good item,"i have the pur pitcher and i thought that is was a good price for 3 filters. i use the pictcher all the time. the filters are larfe, so make sure yu have a large enough container to soak the fiter in before use in the pitcher."
1,"Dont do it, you will regret it",Filters are defective right of the box. Its a known problem that the company refuses to fix.Problem: after about two weeks the filters will take forever filter water(quality of water doesnt matter). To fill this pitcher it will take about 3 to 4 hours to fill if you are lucky
3,PUR Water Pitcher Filters - Watch S&H costs,"Although I am very pleased that I was able to find these from this vendor online, be very aware of shipping and handling costs before making your final decision.Unfortunately for me, I eventually found single-pack filters at my local Ace Hardware. The price for one, multiplied three times, was the same cost as this 3-pack BEFORE S&H; costs.The average life of a single filter is about 2 months, so this 3-pack yields 6 months of filtered water. But in today's economy I know that pennies count, so just do the math and determine if online mail order is the way to go for your situation."
1,No Filter Replacement Indicator,"The Pur Filter Pitcher comes with a filter that has an indicator on it indicating when it needs to be replaced. That is the reason we bought it rather than buying the Brita. However, these filters, which are advertised as being replacement filters for the Pur Pitcher, have no indicator on them."
1,Maybe not so Pur,I've had these only a month and gone through all 4. They get clogged after a week. At first I thought it was a just a bad filter but they all are like it. I wonder if these are actually real PUR filters or just an immitation. No way to really tell but the ones purchased from an actual store have never clogged on me. I recommend not purchasing these from Amazon.
1,Not what it used to be,Only a year ago a PUR filter would easily last for 2 months. Now it barely gets to the end of a single month!!! Screwing customers... no good.
5,PUR filters,"these are great. just like the filter i got with the water pitcher. the price was wonderful, cheapest i've found."
5,PUR Replacement Filters,After searching for them locally I found Amazon to have the best pricing. I'll buy them this way again as long as I get Super Saver Free Shipping.
2,A good fliter with a slow filteration process,I have been using this filter and the 2 stage dispenser for a month now.The filter works really well. But it takes upto 12 hours to filter one batch of water.Extremely slow.Please be wary of that.
4,PUR CRF-905Z Cartridges,I have used PUR filters for 5 years. The filter was goodoriginally and has evolved to a better one. PUR still works for me. The price is right and the quality is great.
4,Good Alternative,I've been using this products for many years. Today is the water I give to my toddler.It's great that I can get it through Amazon. Before I have to go out of my way to get it.
2,Not a complete filter,These filters only filter out heavy metals and chlorine. Not flouride. That's unfortunate because flouride is toxic.
3,Same here,Allow me to echo what others have said: NO MONITOR! INFERIOR! NOT WHAT I EXPECTED TO GET.Have a nice day.
1,"October 3, 2012 Review: Not so hot -- going for another brand.","October 2012: For some reason, this review is being posted for January 2012 -- don't know why, but here's my review.After going through two four-packs, AND several replacement orders due to the filters continually not working -- clogging after only several weeks -- I've pulled the plug on this brand. Out of curiousity, I am going to purchase a Pur filter from a local store and see if there's a difference vs. 'economy' packs online.As for now, I have a new Brita pitcher and filter; the water filtered with the Pur was better. Wish the Pur filters would last more than two weeks. Will stick with Brita until I find another water filter system.Thank you!"
4,Filters water slower,"This filter is different from the one I got with the 18 cup dispenser. Instead of the water coming out of the sides of the filter, it drips water from the bottom of the filter. Because of this it takes much longer than usual so I have to keep an eye out of when to fill the dispenser so I won't be left with an empty dispenser. Other than that, I save money and water still tastes great."
1,Filter performance changed,"When I first began using the filters, they would last 2-3 months. Now, they only last 2 weeks. They completely clog in about 3 weeks to where they won't even filter the water anymore and it remains stuck in the top basin. I would like a replacement for my purchase (I ordered 2 boxes of 3 filters each. Lot #21284333D1). If the problem persists, I have no other choice but to change to another water filtration system, because it is no longer cost effective to have filters that only last 2 weeks."
1,Make SURE this filter fits your pitcher,"I have a PUR pitcher and I change the filter regularly. I bought these filters as a replacement. My ""filtered"" water tastes like tap because the filter allows water to run around it into the bottom of the pitcher. I called PUR's 1-800# to find out if I had bought the wrong filter. The rep told me they didn't make filters for my pitcher anymore (which was interesting considering I buy and replace the filter regularly because I use the pitcher daily). The rep's response to me, ""Sorry, buy a new pitcher."" I will be doing my very best to avoid this company in the future."
3,Pitcher filters used for dispensers,"I own the Pur DS-1800Z Water Dispenser. Previously I purchased the Pur Premium 2 Stage Filters (Model CRF-950Z) as replacement filters. Now, confusingly, this filter model comes in a box labelled ""Pur Pitcher Refill"". But it says on the box that ""All Pur pitcher filters fit in all Pur pitchers, including Flavor Options and Dispenser."" So, it appears that my dispenser is a pitcher and uses the pitcher filter.Also, Pur has discontinued it's Premium 2 Stage Filters according to info on the new filter package. However, Amazon still labels the product online as 2 stage filters. What a mess!PUR CRF-950Z 2-Stage Water Pitcher Replacement Filter, 3-Pack"
4,Does it!,"Can't complain about this product! If you have a calendar, just make a note to yourself (write it down) - ""change filters every 2 months!"" Simple as that! How you can tell that filters need to be changed - easy!!! Filtrating's slowing down tremendously, (about 45-60 days later). You'll notice that!I give it 4 stars only, 'cause I wish it came with some kind of tester, so we all know, how clean and clear the water is!"
4,They work well,"Pro: They work. I have tried other filters on our hard city water tap, but these are the only ones that work.Con: They don't work long. I get about 3 weeks per filter. After that, I'm back to a chalky residue in the water pot."
4,product fit,"I don't know if they've changed the filters but these are different than others I've bought, but they fit and they work. They are not easy to find in stores so I'm happy to buy them from Amazon."
5,Water has great taste!,Pur puts out the best in water filtration. Their filters get out all manner of impurities and cysts. Great price on the filters plus I got free shipping. Price beats Walmart and other retailers. Amazon does a great job also. Fast service.
2,more than dented - one was completely opened!,"like most people shopping for PUR water pitcher pitchers, i was looking for those with the u-ring monitor on top. well, these guys finally fixed the picture associated with it with the correct one, but this wasn't the case when i purchased mine. because they fixed it, i gave them an extra star.the bad thing was, when i got the items, one of the boxes was completely opened, with two of the individual filters also opened inside the box! so i returned everything, even though i ended up paying for shipping myself. however, they did refund my purchase price including shipping when they first sent out the item.while the product description was confusing and the item was totally opened (and not just dented), i decided to give it 2 stars since they seem to be a nice store. btw, PUR stopped making those u-ring monitored filters in june 2006 or something."
3,Performs as expected,"The product performs as expected: replacement filters for PUR. Now how much of an improvement PUR filters make... is arguable depending on a variety of factors. Unfortunately, the 4-pack (or larger) was not available as that is more cost effective than the 3-pack."
4,"good product, poor shipping","good product, each filter lasts around a month.this time, the shipping was bad. it was shipped in a big envelope,the product box was damaged. But Amazon did send a replacement,hassle free."
5,Great Product!,This product is a great alternative to bottled water. Not only is this product great but it is an inexpensive way to be environmentally friendly. I highly recommend this product-Annie
4,Pur Water Pitcher Filters...,I'm very satisfied with these filters. I got them for a great price. Only thing the filters take a tad longer to filter than some I bought in the store - but I can live with that. The water is great tasting after and I will be back for more after they are gone.
1,dirty water,"Upon opening the package, the inside of the filter came spilling out. It was a black granular substance and created quite a mess!"
4,"Want great water, get this product","This product doesn't use the traditional dial that tells you when to change it but it comes with a sticker and reading a sticker is as easy to me as reading the top of the filter itself. Anyhow, it didn't fit just right but I managed and it still does a great job filtering. Hopefully they'll get the size right and it'll fit better. Besides those two things, it's completely fine."
2,pur water pitcher filters,i was surprised to see the price as $19.99 for Pur water pitcher filters since the regular price for these at Walmart is $15.00
2,Happy Water,"I've been using my PUR water pitcher for about 5 years now, and wouldn't want to do without it. The faucet water does not taste good and the filter pitcher removes every bit of taste plus the lime and other minerals.Thanks for continuing to offer these products - even if they are not available in local stores. Using AMAZON to purchase was amazingly easy and fast with fast delivery.Gretchen Dickinson"
3,PUR 2 Review,I had bought these before thru Amazon but this time it doesn't seem to do the job. Water does not taste good and it's hard to remember when to change these.
1,Incorrect Item based on the picture,"Advertisement reflected the original Item ""Ultimate Pure"" 2 stage filters with a picture of that Item, however when product arrived it was not correct filter as shown on image, and we have original filters."
4,Not bad!,"I purchased a PuR water cooler that uses 2 of these filters together. So far I must say that the system works great. The water is refreshing and I don't have intestinal cramping like I do with tap water. This truely filters out enough detrimental cysts and chemicals to make water very safe and tolerable for people to drink.The only thing I don't like is how they are labelled, are all of these styles the ""ultra"" or not?Great product!"
3,"Just OK, not great.","Update: I was overly optimistic when I submitted initial review. In reality, judging by water clarity and residues left in tea thermos, I believe these filters are only good for about a month using Carpinteria, CA, district water. I believe the 2 month/40 gallon replacement schedule is at best, a guideline. Replacement frequency will depend on water quality being filtered. I've downgraded product to 3 stars, as it's just OK.Intitial review: I've used R.O. and faucet attachments, but think this will be the easiest, less maintenance, set up for a limited amount of drinking water. Rather than use two month interval, believe I will track liters/gallons run through the filter to time replacement. I estimate I will only use 40 gallons every 3-4 months. Using two month replacement schedule does not account for usage or water quality going into the filter, which are I believe are more relevant factors. Another advantage to pitcher is it can be taken on trips away from the home."
5,Cheaper Water,"We have been using Pur for several years now and are very happy with the quality of our drinking water and the savings we've realized.We've purchased Pur filters at Amazon, but discovered recently that they are available at a cheaper price (even with sales tax) at our local Wal-Mart. (Prices have been creeping up on Amazon.com.)"
1,False Advertising PUR CRF-950Z,"This PUR water filter is the only one that can be used in the large PUR dispenser. PUR claims that it filters 40 gallons - this is a bogus claim - it stops working after 3 or 4 refills. PUR claims it will work for 2 months - it slows to almost nothing after one week! I thought there was something wrong with my water but, after reading other reviews about slow filtering, I know my claim is valid. Something is wrong with manufacturing (in Mexico) or design. I expected better quality from Brand P&G - no longer. I like the dispenser but sure don't want to pay $350 or more per year for filters - not to mention the amount of plastic material used. I read with disgust how PUR answered one consumer by telling them that most users like the new design better - I don't believe them."
1,Bad product!,"Used to love it! But recently, their filters start blocking already in weeks (even 2-3!). I changed them, and they still do not filter water, except extremely slow, or not at all.Had to change to Britta! Their containers are not that well designed, but the filters do work! Moreover, Pur is not everywhere, Britta is!Sorry!"
1,It is not new filter,"I have use this product for a year. I was very happy with it. However, some water was coming out when I open the new pack. I guess they are not new filter but only refurbish the old new or even just pack the old filter. really disappointed."
2,two thirds of what I paid for,"out of the three filters that come in the pack, one filter clogged after a couple of days, don't know why but it did.that is the reason for the 2 stars, other than that, doing business with Amazon is (for me) the only way to fly."
5,Clean Water,I've had the PUR 2 stage water pitcher for about two years now. It works well and the filters do a great job. Replace more often than you think to keep the water fresh tasting.
3,The jury is still out!,"I purchased 2 of the tank filter systems along with the package of 4 filters. Before ordering I read that several of the reviews mentioned problems with the water filtering very slowly. I did not experience this problem with my filters. I have just changed the filter on both tanks and am beginning to experience problems. One of my systems works well. The second tank and filter is taking about 2 hours to filter the water. The other tank only takes about 20 minutes. Hopefully this lengthy filtering will improve. May be it is a faulty filter.....the jury is still out. One thing for sure, it really makes the water taste wonderful."
4,No effectiveness gauge,"The stickers that go on the pitcher are handy for letting you know when you last changed the filter, but a means of determining the filter's effectiveness would be a better way of knowing when to change the filter."
4,Works For Me,"The filters work just like the original which came with the Pur Pitcher. Like the original filter, sometimes it doesn't want to filter some or all the water you pour in the top container. I just shake it lightly once or twice and it will continue to filter down into the lower container. If not for this flaw I would have given the product five stars."
4,"Good, but too expensive","I have always found these to be quality water filters for my pitcher.The only problem is that they are too expensive for what they are. They say they are good up to 40 gallons, which is not a lot for a full family + dogs."
5,One of the Best,PUR is better than Britta. Their filters take out more impurities and do not leave that grey charcoal water in the first pitcher of water when the new filter is added.
2,Wished they all worked,"Usually at leasrt one out of each package doesn't work for more than 2-3 uses. When it takes 24 to 30 hours for the water to filter through, I do get impatient. Usually I just take the one that doesn't work, throw it in the trash and proceed with another one."
1,water accumulated in the upper tank,water does not get through the filter smoothly. most of time it got clogged. these 3-packs are not as good as the original filters. will not buy them again
4,Filter 2-pack,"Well, I guess the best review i can write about a water filter is to say that it does exactly what it is supposed to. They are not cheaply made and the 2-pack is a good value"
5,Never buy bottled water for your house,Years ago I used to lug gallon water bottles from the store every week. With a product like PUR there is no reason to do that. PUR makes my local water drinkable. Highly recommend. Paired with one of those new soda machines that you can make your own carbonated soda/soft drinks at home... there is no reason to buy sodas in stores either.
2,At least I got a bad one,"The one I installed was fine for the first a few Liters, then water cannot go done even though when there is space in the pitcher. Haven't tried the other two but hope those are working fine. Plus, trying to find the contact information and it took me a while and not explicit at all."
3,PUR filters hard to find,"The folters I received don't exactly look like the ones I was just using. The new ones don't have the red knob (indicator) on top of the unit to show that the filter is being used up. These specific filters are so hard to find since they don't sell them in retail stores anymore. Actually, I can't really tell if they work or not!!??"
5,no need to buy bottles of water,most of us have a refarator(ice box) and we like cold water .so having a ref.water bottle w/a filter. it's cost much less to buy filters. in doing so we save land fill space for other things
1,Terrible.,"Two of the three filters did not work. Checked with PUR customer service and their policy is to mail back the filters (at my expense) and then they would send a replacement. Unacceptable....as not only do I have to deal with the issue of receiving a low quality product....but now I'm supposed to pay double shipping? And on top of that, according to them, this was a one-time courtesy?? Businesses that do not stand behind their products are not worth the headache. Look elsewhere..."
4,filter,"hard to tell how well it filters out the bad things in the water, but the water does taste much better after going through the filter."
2,Expensive ... get a better filter system.,I've tried several such items (including these).If you look for the under sink kind of filter (Omni was what I went with) you can get a nice .5 micron filter system for about $50 for the whole kit.Filters are about $15 and do 550-750 gallons each (ie last 4-6 months for most people) ...Bottom line you buy one for $50 and install it (pretty easy if you're at all handy ... handy 101 ... basic stuff) ...then for about $45 per year you have lot's of very high quality filtered water.THIS THING DOES LIKE 40 GALLONS ... DO THE MATH ... IT'S EXPENSIVE AND A PAIN IN THE b&## ... AND DOESN'T DO AS MUCH AS A HIGHER GRADE FILTER.
2,Why so pricey,"I saw these at walmart the three pack for $15-$17. They were well packaged and last me a long time, but definitely cheaper in a store!"
2,Sneaky sneaky!!!,"Seriously PUR! SERIOUSLY!!! I have been using these 2 stage filters for 4+ yrs now and over the past few months it's apparent that Proctor & Gamble have let their corporate greed take priority. Don't get me wrong these filters used to be the best I have seen (key word being USED) but what once worked for 2 to 4 months depending on use now only works for 2 or 3 weeks, if you're lucky. As other reviewers here have mentioned I also thought it may be an issue with a particular batch or lot number, but having gone through 6 filters (2 sets of 3) ordered from both Target and online and having the same issue with all 6 it's obvious that someone in a boardroom asked why make a product that lasts as long as it does when we can sell the same thing with a shortened life span for the same $ increasing profits 3 fold....Sad but that's the case.*Hopefully if enough people voice their disapproval, PUR might revert back to what once was an awesome product."
2,This is not the item pictured - wrong model,"This filter is NOT the item pictured (flatter top with the orange indicator) but the new and awful dome top style that starts filtering slowly (to where it takes days to filter a tank) after much less use and doesn't seem to produce water that tastes as good as the old style.PUR has discontinued the orange indicator model, it looks like Amazon doesn't sell from a supply of these older and better ones."
1,Clog in a Week,"Just made the mistake a second time to buy these replacement filters for my 2-stage pur water pitcher. For whatever reason these filters always clog up in about a week, where water just sits in the top and won't run through. I am very careful with my pre-soaking, letting water run through first for 15 seconds, making sure they never get dry, but they still clog every time.I bought my last replacement 3-pack from target and had no problems at all, the filters lasting over 1-month.But then I forgot and went back to the convenience of Amazon...won't make that mistake again."
1,Not the item pictured!,"The item pictured here is not what you will receive. You will receive a different model that has a different external and possibly internal design. Most important is that the model you get will NOT have the little orange change filter indicator. This very important feature takes the guess-work out of when to change the filter. Don't buy this item from this seller if you expect to get what is pictured. Thanks, pj-berk."
2,Wrong filters,The product I ordered was misrepresented. The filters I received weren't the filters I ordered. They look like an older model. But I do have the correct filters and they seem to work fine.
3,Pur vs Brita,"I started using filtered water so that I would stop buying drinking water in plastic bottles. I went with Pur over Brita, because I felt that Pur filtered more impurities. Now I have learned that Brita has a recycling program for it's used filters. I, also, feel that the filters are not lasting as long as the filters I used a year ago."
4,Great price!,Great price for my water pitcher filters- half as much as at Target or one of the other big box stores
4,Great Buy and Quality,I liked it because of quality and cost. I saved by buying the 4-pack rather than buying the individual pack and by knowing that the cost does not reduce the quality of the product.
2,No replacement monitor,"When I opened the box I thought Amazon had sent me the wrong item. Where was the orange thingee at the top that tells me when to replace it?? After a little research it appears that PUR has changed the design of their pitcher filters and has removed that feature. Not happy! I count on that stupid orange thing to let me know it's time to replace my filter (don't pay attention to the user supplied picture that clearly shows the replacement indicator!).So now I'll either not change it enough (ewww) or change it too often (gee, that couldn't be PUR's master plan could it?? nawwww). I guess I'll set myself up with a monthly email reminder to change the filter and begin my search for a friendlier water filtration system."
1,"Were great ,now BAD","Like many of the reviews the last set of 3 filters I got from amazon were defective ,had black granules in water, don't last as long and water taste different ,so the company better go back to old product,I am going to call them, to complain looks like they have a Big problem."
4,60 days of clear...great tasting water...,"Ordering these in a 3 pack saves a bit of money and it really isn't that expensive. This is my first filter replacement. I have the 18cup pitcher for my fridge which allows me to get a drink of clear and great tasting water anytime. I noticed after about 2 months(60 days), the water didn't filter very fast and didn't taste as good. Ordered these, replaced the filter and it was like new again(I noticed when I shook the old filter after I took it out the rocks on the inside wouldn't move and it looked dirty on the inside). I drink alot of water and these 3 filters should last me about 6 months(180 days) which is a GREAT value."
2,Clogs within a month,"I have been using PUR filters for many years. The new version, clogs up within a couple of weeks. No, it is not an indicator that you have maxed out rated quantity of quantity of water - I hardly drink so much. Just another arm twist strategy to buy more of it."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I HAVE PURCHASED TWO OF THESE REPLACEMENT FILTERS AT TARGET AND A WEEK LATER ALL THAT FILTERS ARE DROP BY DROP AND HAS LET MY FAMILY THIRSTY. I HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY WATER CUASE THIS DARN THING DONT FILTER ENOUGH WATER. IM VERY DISSAPOINTED!! I WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO BRITA! BOOOOOOOO, VERY POOR FILTERS!!"
5,A Lot of water for your buck,We drink a lot of water in our household. These filters are not only difficult to find in retail stores they are also more expensive than what Amazon offers. This 4 pack is a very good deal. The filters work well and last about 8 monts.
5,Awesome water filters,"The product does the job as described, great price and free shipping, what else can you ask for?"
5,"PUR 2 Stage Water Pitcher Replacement Filters # CRF-950Z, 4 pack","This is a great deal, buying in quantity. Amazon had the best pricing on these filters. I will be buying my future replacement filters here."
4,Great product,I have a PUR dispenser and these replacement filters fit like a glove. Super fast shipping and good packaging from the seller. I highly recommend.
1,Not Happy,"When I received the product, the box was open but I thought it would be okay since each of the filters was sealed within a foil wrapper. However, one of the filters was a dud."
2,Not that impressive,Does not change the taste and could not feel any improvement in filtered water from the perspective of odor and taste. These are too small cartridges and they do not last longer. I would not buy this product again
2,bad,This filter is the worst one I have ever used! It only last about 3 weeks and then the filter stops filtering. I only use the water for drinking and make a couple cups of coffee. Terrible filter!
1,something weird,"I bought this and obviously using it as usual. It doesn't fit the water pitcher the right way so water seeps through w out being filtered properly. I ended up writing to PUR and they sent me a coupon for a replacement, but this was weird. Never again buying this kind of stuff from Amazon. Not the first time people said stuff like this."
1,Wouldn't buy from Amazon,"Very disappointed with this purchase. When the individual filter package was opened there were water droplets on the packaging, we've purchased filters for 9+ years and never saw water droplets before. This made me suspicious of the filter, could it have been used? Not sure. Proceeded to use the filter in the dispenser and the water tasted as if it's time to replace the filter. I would not recommend buying these filters from Amazon, but from a retail store. The savings wasn't worth it since the filters are not quality filters. We didn't use the filter till it was past the 30 day return period, if I purchased it from a retail store I would have at least 90 days for returns."
1,super costly filter!,"Each filter is only last 1 week, and it stops filtering completely after 2 weeks.Although I like the water taste better but can't afford to spend $7 every week for a new filter!!PUR saying I need to change to Stage-1 filter but I can't find it anywhere, even Amazon doesn't carry it.It's a useless advice.I'm giving it 1 star for taste of water.I'm going back to Brita!"
2,Filter with short lifespan,"I agree with other reviewers about the shortened life of these filters. I thought something was wrong with my water! After 3 weeks of filtering 2 gallons a day, the water was coming through the filter excruciatingly slow. I didn't notice a significant change in taste, so I am assuming the filter still works to some extent. You just need to wait A LONG TIME for a glass. PUR needs to reconsider this tactic, this current and greedy one does not sit well with me.Until convinced otherwise, I won't be buying another set."
2,2 Filters are deffective,In general I like this water. It does significantly improve the taste of Los Angeles water. Perhaps I bought the defective one but 2 filters out of 4 didn't serve the full length and just stopped filtering water shortly after installation.
4,pur filter replacement,"The Pur filter replacement does not have an indicator, as mentioned, but is vastly better than Brita, which does not taste nearly as good and leaves a charcoal residue. It locks into the pitcher instead of falling out or having to be held by hand, as with the Brita. I use my filters for about 1.5 months for a family of 4, and replace them when the filtration process takes a long time. This system is well worth the slightly higher cost."
2,Not as good as previous model,"I've always loved my PUR filters and large refrigerator tank. The newer filters, however, are terrible. The water filters through very, very slowly, and by a month's time, they stop filtering the water at all. So instead of changing the filter every 3 months as I previously did, I am now changing them about once a month.Unless PUR comes up with a better filter, I'll be researching another water pitcher."
3,Slow at filtering,"Overall, water taste the same which is great. The filter don't seem to last that long. First week or so, it filters easily, after that it takes a while for it to filter water."
4,Easy to use,"Although it is easy to use and does its job, it is a bit too expensive and that is why I gave it a four star rating."
1,Very Limited Shelf-Life,"Out of four Pur water filters I used in the last two months, three clogged within a couple of weeks. I live in New England, receiving water from the Quabbin Reservoir, an excellent water source. As such, these filters were simply an insurance policy. I would highly recommend choosing another product.At this writing, due to favorable reviews, I will try the 'Mavea' product line. Hopefully, I will have better results."
2,Not working,"I purchased the 3-pack and I'm on my second filter. The first two have suddenly stopped working. I contacted Pur directly and they will send me a ""one time"" replacement.I'm not sure what to do for the second filter."
4,Good filter but have had some failures,"I have used these filters with the DS-1800Z water dispenser for 2+ years. I live in a Third World country and all our drinking water, tea, coffee, etc. comes from these filters. They do a good job. I give them a 4-star rating because we get about a 10-20% failure rate when we 'first' install them. We follow the directions (soaking and rinsing them before installation) but they appear to be clogged and will not pass water. Nothing can be done except to throw them away and try another. I have written to Customer Support but haven't heard back from them yet. Yet, they are a good filter and I will continue to use them even though 1 in 5-6 is bad. In fact, I just bought 12 more from Amazon."
1,"These filters work well for one week max, not 1 month as claimed","I saw on the Today show that the Pure pitcher these filters go to is the best on the market. Unfortunately, each of these filters is supposed to last one month. After 5-6 days, they slow down drastically.Initially these filters can filter the whole pitcher in about 2 minutes. After 5-6 days, the filters take 25-30 minutes to filter a single pitcher. I don't know if I received a defective batch, but I should have only replaced 1 filter according to the printed guidelines. Instead I have gone through 4 filters."
5,These work great,I think they are better than the britta filters. I like the taste and the purity of the pur filters.
5,Pur filters,We have used these filters and frig pitcher for years.The pitcher fills fairly quickly and the filter holds particulate and minerals so the water tastes great.
1,Clogs after a couple of weeks,"I'm with the other reviewers who complained about how the flow slows to a drip after a couple of weeks. Very disappointed with this, considering that our Brita pitcher filters never have this problem."
3,Nice product but...,I have owned the pitcher for these filters for a few years and enjoy the water. The only problem is that sometimes one of the replacement filters will be a dud; the water will not flow through at a reasonable rate and I wind up having to change the filter early to stop the aggravation.
1,NOT GOOD AT ALL,I recently purchased These filters along with a PUR picture for my office.I have literally used 4 filters in 5 weeks - after 10 days water will not flow through the filter.I called PUR and received the typical call center rep in a foreign country.She offered to give me a coupon for 1 free filter and then said they would send another coupon for a buy on get one free.The rep told me it was my water's fault I filter NYC tap water)I would recommend you purchase a Brita and avoid the PUR system.
4,Cheaper by the 1-Pack?!,"I'm a died-in-the-wool Pur user. I have a Brita pitcher as well, which I was forced to buy when Pur had some kind of epic distribution failure and couldn't stock replacement filters here or any retailer that I could find.The Brita pitcher is flimsy and cheaply made. Pur water - from Los Angeles DWP tapwater, at least - simply tastes better than Brita.But here's a wacky thing: As of this writing, filters in 4-packs cost $1.50 each MORE than filters in 3- and 2-packs. Filters in one-packs are the best deal of all! They cost $0.60 less than 2- or -3 packs, and OVER $2.00 LESS per filter, than buying the 4-pack!Crazy, isn't it? Sure wish I'd noticed that *before* I ordered that 4-pack, for an extra $8!!!Do you see that, too? Or is this an example of Amazon's mythical Customer-specific pricing?Anyway, caveat emptor, fellow Pur users!"
1,"Design was changed, so now they only last a month regardless of use","I've bought replacement filters for years. They were able to work for quite some time, which is good because I don't use a lot of filtered water.The new ones, as many other people have found, now stop flowing after a month. This seems to happen regardless of how much you actually use them, in my experience.I bet the company would say ""we're just ensuring that you have properly filtered water."" really?I imagine someone with a spreadsheet figured this would be good for sales, to have the filters stop flowing after a monnth. I'm going to find another solution from a different company. Goodbye Pur."
1,"Once good, no longer...","We used to really like these filters but my last 2 orders have started clogging up after just a couple weeks of use, really disappointing. Will be ordering Brita I guess..."
1,only 1 out of 3 filters works,2 of the filters were defective and no water would drain from the top. called customer service and they sent only 1 replacement. very disappointing and a waste of money.
1,Used to be great,"I have used Pur filters for a long time and have always loved them. Not sure if it's a new design or what, but they are now only lasting about two weeks and then they stop filtering. The water just stays at the top of the pitcher and doesn't go down. I googled to see if anyone else was having similar problems and they are. Back to the drawing board, designers. Your new design stinks!"
3,"Some are crazy slow, some not","Been using these for a couple of years now, and my only complaint is that sometimes they take 12 -24 hours to filter one gallon of water - and although one might expect that as the filter got dirty it would clog up and slow down, it seems completely arbitrary - one filter will get that slow after 2 days use, while another might take 2 weeks, and yet another will never slow down, and I'll just change it because it's time. So, probably 8 out of 10 times I'm changing the filter before it should be needed because I can't stand to wait so long for it to do it's job. I asked customer service about this when I first started using them, and they said to take it out of the the pitcher and shake it up, but that does nothing.Still it's a better deal than bottled water, so until I hear of a better one, I guess I'll keep using them..."
1,Usage indicator,"I like to old design better, too. The one with the usage indicator. You can still find these on eBay! Not sure what I'll do when I can't find these anymore. Who wants to use write down how many gallons have been filtered? These things are too expensive not to have an easier way of determining the life of the filter."
4,"Yes, yes, there's no indicator: Time to move on, people","It is obvious from the current listing that Amazon is selling the CRF-950Z, which lacks the red usage indicator on the top, and not the old design, which has been discontinued for a while now. Plenty of Amazon reviewers already have mentioned that the indicator is gone. It's time to accept that fact and move on. The change in design merits at most a one-star deduction. It's really not difficult to tell when the filter needs to be replaced: If the water flow through the unit starts getting slow, it's done. For those who don't know how to use a calendar, Pur includes stickers in the box that you can place on the pitcher as a reminder. The bottom line is that the CRF-950Z a good product and is superior in performance to Brita."
1,FILTERS ARE DEFECTIVE...DO NOT BUY,Do not waste your money on these filters because they do no work. I bought a four-pack and the filters are so slow that literally hours after filling the tank the water hasn't filtered. Totally useless.
1,"Buy ""Clear 2 O"" instead","Consumer Reports rates Clear 2 O much higher on quality and price. Part of the price problem may be that PUR has tacked on a mandatory welfare donation for Africa. If you agree that such donations should be up to the individual, buy the more effective, less expensive Clear 2 O!"
1,Used filter,"I was surprised when I opened the packet, as there were water droplet all around. It seems that they sealed pack the old one. Packaging was good and it arrived even before the expected time."
2,Does the pitcher contain bisphenol-A?,"I loved these filters and the pitchers, and it removed more contaminants than Brita. However, I just read this month's Consumer Reports. It said that the only water pitcher type filter that was not made of thought-to-be-toxic bisphenol-A was Zero Water brand.Please say this isn't so!"
3,"PUR CRF-950Z 2-Stage Water Pitcher Replacement Filter, 3-Pack",Quick delivery - gift mailed directly to recipient did not see item - recipient happy. Would recommend this seller to others.
3,Works Great,"These filters for the Pur water filtration systems are really easy to install, my only complaint is that there is not a recycling program for these filters."
5,Works just fine. Taste like bottle water to me.,"In my opinion this filter does a very good job. I originally bought to used while I'm hospitalize because I have never like the water the hospital would serve me so I got this. It works and that's what counts, considering that it works with gravity and not water pressure it will filter somewhat slow. So if you need something faster you might want to look elsewhere."
5,Great Product - Much Better Than Brita,"I've been using Pur filters for years, since I read about the technology they use. I have a pourable pitcher in the bathroom and a countertop model in the kitchen. I'm sad that I can no longer buy replacement filters locally (western San Jose, CA). Drugstores, Target, Costco and the rest now seem to carry only Brita. Too bad--Brita-filtered water at friends' homes tastes noticeably worse.Filtering really is worth it. Big savings vis-a-vis bottled water and much better for the environment (less plastic). I find Pur a good compromise between bottled and the very expensive filtering systems."
3,They last 3 weeks.,"I've owned my dispenser for a few years and even though I know I am being ripped off with the filters, I still wouldn't go back to the gallon water because I hate knowing the empty plastic jugs are going to waste. I hate hauling the jugs home from the market and I hate how much space they take up in the recycling bags. I live in a neglected part of NYC and occasionally, the tap water will be brown or yellow. I filtered yellow tap water today and it turned into clear water that I used to make my beverage."
4,Very good quanitity and value,"You go to buy these individually (or sometimes in packs of 2) in the store, and the prices are ridiculous. If you know you're going to need these filters down the road, then this is the pack for you!"
5,Filters work well,I've been using these water filters for a couple of years now. I have both a PUR water pitcher and a PUR water dispenser. The water tastes good after running through these filters. I live in a suburban area on the outside of the capitol city of our state. We have a relatively new water treatment plant but our water still isn't as good without some filteration.
1,Confirm Filter last only 2 Weeks !!! Horrible..Waste Money,"Water does taste great, but within 2 WEEKS, it clogs up!!!I tried to shake it, no use...I am so disappointed consider water does taste great.This end up costing more than a 2.5 galloon I can get from the market..DO NOT BUY.."
1,extremely short filter life!,I've tried 2 different boxes of filters and finally complained to the company. They responded with a form letter! The filters are expensive as well and you'll see many similar complaints.
1,New design is bad news!!,"After noticing that I was going through filters around 2X faster than normal, I decided to check the Amazon reviews and see if it was just me or my water - based on the reviews I suppose not! These filters are just too expensive to go through so quickly. I am definitely going to be shopping around for a different brand of water filtration pitchers."
2,Why is the 4 pack more expensive compared to 3 packs?,Did anyone else noticed this? Let me know if I misinterpret the price on these filters.3 packs = 17.99/3 = $64 packs = 34.67/4 = $8.67Am I missing something? How am I saving $4.32 (11%)on pack of 4.Thanks
2,I like the old ones better,"Since you have no choice, if you have a PUR pitcher you'll probably have to buy these. The old ones were far better because they included and indicator and the water that ran through them tasted far better. These filters give the water a mild metallic taste. Yuck."
2,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it...well, they did","I don't know what else to say other than I am now having to shop for a new way to filter water. One of the main reasons I used the PUR filters was the indicator on the filter. I am the only one in the house who uses the pitcher so the insipid stickers don't do me much good. When they factor in the use of the filter, I'm sure they use a family of four formula. This is why I liked the indicator.I'm now going to look at the Aquasana brand. Even though it costs a bit more, it filters out all the stuff I want filtered out that PUR didn't do anyway!"
1,PUR 2-Stage Water Pitcher Filters,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!I Bought a 3-pack on August 27th and had to order more on September 21st because these filters get clogged up too fast... It's a shame or sham because I love how the water tastes from my PUR pitcher. The only reason why I still use my PUR system is because I have a Frigidaire refrigerator and the inline filter does the same thing these filters do... get clogged way before they should. And Frigidaire does not sell a filter bypass. So I'm stuck ordering these things. I gave a rating of one only because the water tastes good...
5,Wonderful price with efficient filter,Water tastes wonderful with this filter. It has good quaility and it does not spit out carbon particle. Only week point of this filter is life. It last two months and I wish I can use at least three months.
1,Takes Hours to Filter,"I bought the Pur pitcher, followed the instructions to prepare it, but it takes FOREVER to filter.There's something wrong with this filter design. I have a friend with the same pitcher and the same problem. You can fill the pitcher to the top and it will still be 95% unfiltered hours later. We live in NYC and the water is not abnormally dirty, .I've used Brita filters before this and it filtered fine, much faster. I will be going back to Brita filters."
1,Filters go bad in about a month everytime!,Apparently the company changed the replacement filter as recently the filters stop working 2 weeks to a month now.Im not blowing money on this again!Seriously just get a aquasana countertop filter off amazon $100 you buy replacement filter every 6 monthes.ALso go to aquasana.com and they are currently having a 20% off sale. if you buy the counter filter and get the water for life its less than $90 but with shipping about $94
1,The old design was better.,When I got these we wondered what was up with the missing indicator on top. I did some research and discovered it was a new design. I definitely liked the older one better because it showed usage based on flow through the filter. With this one you just end up guessing how much water you have run through it. Also these filters keep leaking their guts into the pitcher. I never had that happen with the old ones. It looks like salt and pepper all over the bottom of the pitcher. You have to be careful pouring so you don't get it into your glass. If the filters guts are leaking out into the pitcher what else is getting into the water? Once this pack is gone I will seek out another filtering solution. It is a shame because the old design was nice. I wrote P&G and they don't seem to care.
2,PUR not so pure,"The filters delivered were below the quality of the filters that I have been using for years. The filters did not have the replacement indicator that has been on every filter that I have had before. While that might be acceptable, the real problem is a very fine carbon residue that was deposited in the container. I probably will not order these again."
1,Terrible,"All three of these filters stopped filtering water within a week of use. The water just sits at the top of the carafe and slowly filters over days (DAYS!). I found that I could temporarily fix this problem by taking out the filters and shaking them, but the problem comes back shortly after. I researched this problem and found that many other people seem to be having this exact same problem with PUR filters. I purchased a Mavea pitcher and filters to replace my PUR pitcher and won't be purchasing anything from PUR in the future."
1,This filter is ridiculously slow,"I was happy owner of 18-cup dispenser until I decided to replace filter with CRF-950Z.I noticed clogging issue on day 1 - the water flow was ridiculous right out of the box.After 2 weeks it takes more than 20 hours to filter the upper reservoir.What a shame, PUR!"
2,Water Filters,"I have had pretty good luck with this product in the past but the order before this one, 3 out of the 4 filters only worked about 3 to 4 times. The charchol filler kept running out and much was in the box when I opened it.When I held it up to the light, it was only half full on three of the filters. I was very disappointed with this performance as I said,I have had pretty good luck with this product before. If this latest batch of (4) does the same thing , I will consider a different brand filter. It's a lot of money to spend on a filter that only lasts less than HALF the time it is suposed to.I guess I would not recomend it unless things improve.I also feel some sort of compensation would be due under the circumstances.Sincerely,James D. Mack"
2,GREAT TASTE TERRIBLE FILTERING TIME,"I love the taste from PUR water filters. I've been using them for about 18 months and in that time I have had a bad time with over half of them. The problem doesn't develop right away, but will manifest itself after 1 to 3 weeks of use. The water suddenly begins to drain from the top through the filter VERY SLOWLY. It can take over 3 hours for the top of a small pitcher to drain through. A rigorous shaking sometimes improves things temporarily. When this 3-pack is done I will be switching to another brand."
1,Doesn't last for the time specified,"The literature that comes with this product indicates that it should last at least 2 months, or a specified number of gallons. Since there are only two people in our household, and we live in NYC where the water quality is superb, I am thinking that the filters should last 2 months. They don't. After only three weeks the flow slows to a crawl. After 4 weeks they are useless!!!I have contacted customer service which referred me to the literature that comes with the product sent in an email. They offered no explanation and no replacement of the filters.I am switching back to Brita.I definitely would think twice and read some other reviews before reading this."
1,Que pasa con mi pedido,hasta cuando voy a seguir esperando? se suponía que llegaba el 22 de Septiembre y aun no llega... Esta vez espero hasta este fin de semana y cancelo la orden..
1,Filters the water to slowly,"I have had used the PUR filters for at least a year and most of the time I get maybe three weeks before the start to slow down considerably. It takes at least 30 minutes to filter the quart of water (it starts off maybe taking 5 minutes). I fill the pitcher maybe 2 -3 times a day so I am getting about 20 gallons before it starts going really slow. This is pretty standard for most of the filters maybe twice I have gotten 6 weeks out of a filter and this is with it going slow the last week. I am not going to use the PUR system anymore, my Brita was much better but since the Brita doesn't filter out a lot of things I am going to look for something different. I liked that the PUR filters out more material, but it is a lot more expensive since I have to replace it every three weeks to a month (I wait about a week with is going really slow before replacing it)."
3,Filters the water VERY slow,I have been using these filters for over a year now and for some reason the last set that I bought take a very long time to filter the water. Typically the water filters pretty quickly. With this last shipment it could take over 30 minutes and possibly up to an hour for the water to filter. I am hoping the next time I order these this won't happen.I would give the product 5 stars if these filters filtered quicker like the others I have ordered in the past.
2,"PUR CRF-950Z 2-Stage Water Pitcher Replacement Filter, 3-Pack","I've been using this filter for years with no problem. But I notice that right after the design change, the filters don't last like before. The filter usually last a month to two but I went through 3 filters in last month. I have 3 more filters left and if they don't last like they did before, I'm buying something else."
3,Not Sure if Original Product,"Not sure if this is original product. The packaging, look and feel is completely different from what we get in Target/Walmart. Even the way it writes PUR is different than usual. Just change yesterday. Still to find how it works"
4,"Performs Well, But...","These filters perform well.Separately, and in comparison to the older model units (with the replacement indicator), my experience is that water runs through these filters faster and need to be replaced weeks earlier."
2,"Makes for Better Taste, BUT....","It doesn't remove chlorine (just the taste and smell -- see updated package), neither does it remove flouride, which regardless of what you hear, has NEVER shown any positive benefit to being added to our water. It just makes heart patients unable to drink it safely. Unit price also has increased again and the product is disappearing from store shelves in 3-pack.Where can one get water that's just water?? In my opinion this filter is better than nothing, but still a far cry than bottled spring water. I want the chlorine and flouride out. If you want to do some interesting reading, do some responsible research on the web about flouride."
2,PUR Filter,"Unhappy that the product carries the number for our water dispenser, but does not fit. The dome on top hits the water resevoir. I modified the filter to work, but will not buy this product again."
4,Pur water replacement filter,"Very happy with the product. It does a nice job of providing clean, good tasting water."
5,PUR Water Filters(CRF-950Z),Amazon sent my filters right away and I received them right on time. This was my second purchase of the filters and I think they work great. I live alone so they work longer than normal which is a plus. Highly recommend.
4,"Good price, good product.","Nothing too fancy, but they're good enough to keep the current PUR model around and not go looking for a new one."
5,Excellent as usual,"I really love those filters. After using PUR I prefer it over Brita as it has less coal floating in the water (not aying that it is harmful, but it is annoying!)"
4,Easy to use,Product arrived promptly. These filters are a breeze to use and it's better for the environment-bottled water is such a waste. Water tastes great!
4,Pur filters rated best by independent testers,"I have no way of actually measuring the voc's so cant say with any certainty how well this filter performs. I can only go by results given be several online test sites that rate it the highest when it comes to removing some of the nasty chemical stuff (VOC's, volatile organic compounds)I was previously a fan of zero water but found it did not do as good a job on voc's and just removed almost all disolved solids,(TDS) some of which are minerals good for youThe PUR pitcher is a little better designed in that it is possible to pour filtered water while unfiltered water is still in the resevoir on top----cant do it if full but almost impossible to do it with any water in zero water's pitcher resevoir"
5,Won't Use Any Other,Best quality and good price. I won't use any other. Can't make a cup of coffee without my filtered water.
5,"Great product and price, but Amazon does not carry the 2-filter package anymore","This is a great product; I use it with the big PUR pitcher, and it works fine. However, Amazon do not carry the package that I used to buy anymore! The 2-filter package used to be 11.50, so less than 6 dollars per filter. Now Amazon only carries the bigger 3 and 4 filter packages, but they end up being more expensive actually, at 7+ dollars a piece. Moreover, I prefer to buy filters as I need them, not have them lying around. I am sure that people who try this filtration system for the first time would also appreciate a smaller 1 or 2 filter ""sampler-type"" package."
4,Price for health & peace of mind,"I ask myself, is the water potable (term used by public health officials for ""drinkable"")? I personally feel better when the water has gone through a filtration process at home. Pur, I feel does it well. I don't say that because I have tested the water quality after it gets filtered by Pur, but due to an unde influence by the advertising claims. Now to come to the point - why 4 stars? We are a family of 2 and each refill lasts just 3 weeks. Perhaps our usage is high because the coffee is made from Pur water. Note: each filter is supposed to filter 40 gallons of water. I wish it would last longer (or that I adjusted my usage for it to last longer)! But it is the price I am willing to pay for my peace of mind..."
1,bad,"When I opened the bag of filter, all of three had water drops and sand on it.....They looked like already have been used!!!!I have ordered this item so many times, and never has the experience that this time.I have just order another "" PUR 2-Stage Water Pitcher Replacement Filter, 1-Pack "" and hope the situation today won't happen again."
2,This batch doesn't last long,"Just as others have been noting, this filter barely lasted 2 weeks, and now it's taking forever to filter water. Previous filters (purchased from target) lasted months."
1,Filters clog up shortly after purchase,"I bought the pitcher version of PUR although we have very clean water here, to get rid of the fluoride taste. After 2 weeks, no water filtering through anymore. When I called their customer service, I got promised a filter replacement, and instead they sent me a 2 for 1 coupon. Bought a new filter, which clogged up again after only 10 days. What is going on here? Their faucet version holds up to 6 months if you take the filter out after 3 months and shake it. Not so with the pitcher!"
4,A lot for the money,"A very nice value for the money. I have only needed to do it once or twice during the life of a filter. The filters do their job well. Of the pitcher systems I have tried, this 2-stage system produces the best tasting water. These filters really make water taste clean. The only problem is that they occasionally begin to filter more slowly. The solution is to remove the filter and give it a couple shakes. Not a big deal -"
1,Become Super Slow After 2 Weeks,The filter became super slow and not usable after two weeks. I use New York city water.
3,Now lacks use indicator,"I've been using PUR water filters for years. The price for a 3 pack filter was VERY good at Amazon, so I bought a couple packs. The NEW packs do NOT have the use indicator. As someone who is constantly struggling to intake more water, I use it less than most folks. Now I'm back to counting the number of pitchers I use. They used to be hassel-free, now I'm back to counting."
3,just so-so,"I had been purchasing PUR replacement filter cartridges from Target and WalMart, but had been having an increasingly difficult time finding them in stock, or at a decent price. The price here is much cheaper and, I think, overall worth the money for that reason. However, the downsides are: 1) There is no indicator to show when to replace the cartridge (I guess I'll have to wait until the water starts to drain into the pitcher too slowly.). 2)Call me crazy, but this water doesn't taste as crisp as the water from the cartridge that does have the orange indicator-- which costs a little more, but supposedly filters out less."
1,Rip Off - they're all clogged,"This really makes me angry. These filters are like flushing money down the toilet. Only the very top filter holes work or else they are used with a lousy refurbish job. I tolerated the first one far too long, then put in a new one and it didn't work after about two fills. I still have one left but can assume by the first two that it's useless too. Now I cannot return them because it's been too long since I purchased.My advice: buy your filters from a bricks and mortar store where you can be assured they're new!"
1,Too Many Functions,Too many competing functions and an unintelligible set of instructions make this product impractical and almost impossible to use.
3,Examination made easy for students,An easy and amusing read for students but requires a prior grounding in clinical skills. Useful but certainly not a must have and not the sort of book students can carry and refer to on the ward. Would have benefited from more appropriate tables and flow charts to refer to in the clinical setting.
3,Ok majhonng game,"I was hoping this would be an interesting twist on classic majhonng. But some levels were extremely difficult to complete! I like a challenge and I don't mind something being difficult. It's frustrating to not be able to get past a level no matter how many different ways you try to do so! There are some other minor issues that need work. If not for these, it would be an awesome version of majhonng!!"
4,Great Bottle- where do you get replacement filters?,"Strong,reliable and leak proof, these bottles fit very nicely in bicycle cages. When touring, these bottles do a wonderful job of reducing the chemical flavor of many local municipalities water supplies, especially in the mountains. Although the carbon filters reduce the water flow slightly, a good squeeze will quench your thurst..."
5,stands the test of time,"i loved this book at age 12, and i just reread it now - it's extremely good. raymond jardine is a top-rate literary character. i might not be able to go so far as the reviewer who called Gordon Korman ""the best fiction author of the 20th and 21st centuries,"" but he definitely has something really special."
5,One of the greatest books out there. I swear.,This is one of the only books that has ever made me laugh out loud. I have read it at least six times and it just keeps getting better. HOW COULD A CLASSIC LIKE THIS GO OUT OF PRINT! THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!
5,It couldn't get better...,"I read this, a saint at a time, to my 5 and 8 year old sons at bedtime. They loved it and want more, more, more. The eight year old proposed the title of this review. I liked it because the saints are not saccharin but they are hereos of virtue and the author makes them touchable. I'm at Amazon now to order the sequel."
3,A little bit disappointed,"I am a little bit disappointed after reading all the stories. The disappointment was due to my high expectation after seeing the high ratings given by the other reviewers. To me, the stories are nice, but not as phenomenal as they said. Maybe I have too high standard for stories since I have read so many stories from West and East.And the pictures are disappointing. They could have been better. I intended to purchase the sequel, but now I have changed my mind."
5,Great books and beautiful ilitrations.,My 5 year old granddaughter loved reading these books to her sister and I. So it was good reading for young and old
1,dud,never would charge--charge light came on heat light came on. For vibration it makes a good doorstop and it is of course not returnable. on't be buying anything else from the seller--sae yourself some irritation and avoid this product and seller.
1,Horrible writing and acting.,"Truly disappointed when I see black people act like this, so amateur. No story to this play. makes you so unhappy to have bought this DVD."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,This movie was absolutely horrible. Horrible acting. Horrible script. Horrible music (given the title and the fact that the story is supposed to revolve around a group of black kids and a group of Latino kids who unwillingly join together to form a choir - the horrible music is unforgivable). Do not waste your time or money on this bomb. The only bright spot is that it includes a black father who has a strong and loving presence in his child's life. That's not enough to build this movie on.
1,This movie is a waste of time!,"This movie is horrible! Bad acting, bad sound, bad singing. No punch-line. Complete mockery of the church. HORRIBLE!!!!! There was so much going on in this movie. I can't believe Laman Rucker attached his name to this garbage."
3,Ok Movie,This movie was ok the acting was not the greatest and the plot was missing something. Its a movie that everyone can watch but it is definitely low budget and could possibly offend some religious groups (Christian) because of the limited view on Christianity and Women's roles.
2,Not great,"This movie was terribly done. I thought the story idea sounded great which was why I rented it but the way in which it was done ruined it. The editing was terrible, the continuity was even messed up in some jump shots. This was very amateur. It seemed like it wasn't looked over enough during the editing. I also thought there was too much going on and there were scenes that were really unnecessary. Instead of having all of the unnecessary scenes and situations there could have been more situations they could have went more in depth on. Then the film would've been much better."
5,"An attention engaging, thoroughly entertaining read","Blast Man Standing is a thrilling, techno-terrorism drama by Robert V. Spelleri that kicks off with a nighttime ambush and escalates into a desperate battle as Tom Malone struggles to save his family and his own life. An action-packed saga rife with looming threats and sudden twists, Blast Man Standing is deftly written, attention engaging, thoroughly entertaining read."
1,Still haven't received the item.,"I am very disappointed. I have not received my cd and it has been quite a while since my order. I have tried to contact the seller twice and have not received a reply. In light of the holidays, I would have expected to have it by now. It has been almost a month. I would not advise dealing with this seller due to lack of customer service and non-delivery."
1,BEWARE!!! RERECORDINGS.,this Club Nouveau/Timex Social Club greatest hits on Thump records is all rerecorded vocals by a different front man. Sounds awful. AVOID.
1,Waste of Money,This CD is a waste of money. Its not the origional you hear. You buy and then listen to find out its not what is advertised. Then you find out your stuck with it. Happy joy joy.
2,Dots fell off,I purchased 3 balls. All the dots have fallen off after an hr or so of not-to-heavy use. So far the core of the balls have held up but I'm not impressed so far.
4,Hard to beat - so easy.,After researching for the best gate kit I decided on the Homax No-Sag kit to replace the gate that was here when we bought the house 3 years ago. The gate would only open partially because it was dragging on the driveway. The EasyGate kit took about 30 minutes to assemble and works great!
1,Sagging Gates,This kit is easy to build but the gate sagged about 2 inches. The hinges are cheap and they bent substantially. Enough that I have had to rebuild the whole gate. Very frustrating and a waste of money.
5,amazing gate,"I have buit many gates in my life, but using the ""EasyGate"" truly makes it simple and foolproof!And, like the advertising says, the gate is square, and can't sag!"
4,Perfect for any wood gate,After installing a privitcy fence I needed a double gate entrance. I ordered 2 kits and got the look I needed. The instructions were easy to follow and install. I would recommend this product to anyone needing to create a gate.
4,Hinges are worthless but otherwise the kit is good,"I made a gate for a picket fence using regular (not treated) pine, so it was fairly light. The gate's about four feet wide, or so. The hinges were welded on and made so that you cannot knock out the pins; they were flimsy and simply could not take the fairly light weight of my gate without warping a great deal. I finally took it down, used my angle grinder to take off the hinges, and used some regular outdoor strap hinges from a hardware store.The great thing is that the gate has not warped even a little bit in three years, and continues to work well. So, I gave it four stars. If they made a model without welded on hinges, I'd easily give it five stars."
4,Good setup,This is really a pretty easy way to make a gate. Just make sure you have relatively straight wood.
2,Great idea...poor quality,I purchased this to build two gates in my newly constructed fence.It seemed like a great idea and an easy way to build a gate.Poor quality killed the concept. The supplied wood screws were VERY cheap. I twisted the heads off of two of them during installation. Then once built and installed they rust. My gates have been up less than three months and most all of the screws are rusting. I will be replacing them with the same screws I used to build the fence.Then the other day I discovered that one of the welds on the brackets had broken. Essentially making the bracket worthless for carrying any weight on that corner or for keeping the gate in plane. The weld spots are rusting on the other brackets so I expect them to fail in the same way soon.The hinges are integrated (very convenient) but they too are showing rust. I sprayed in some wax lube in hopes that it will prevent further rust.Its a great idea but needs significantly better quality.
3,"Helpful, but could use some improvement","This gate kit will indeed help you create your gate. But the kits are not without problems. As others have noted, not every brace is square. I ended up ordering one more than I needed and returning one kit full of non-square parts. Also, the hinges barely get the job done - they are simply front door hinges. One person suggested cutting off the hinges with a hacksaw and using regular gate hinges."
1,Bad quality,We had 4 gates to build in our new fence and I thought that this would be a great way to do it. The idea of it was great but none of the brackets were square or straight so I had a lot of shimming and poor fitting corners to address. Until they improve their quality I would not recommend this product.
3,This man can really write,"It's unusual for me to read a Western. Movies and TV series, great! But Western books? It's rare for me to read one.I liked SHANE. I liked a book my brother loaned me about 25 or 30 years ago about a lawman who refused to use a gun. I had the privilege of editing for Dusty Rhodes. I also loved TRIED AND TRUE, which I read for Books Unbound, and I apologize to the author for forgetting her name, but I'm writing this review while I'm without Internet access.Those are the only Westerns I've enjoyed reading, except for one I recently reviewed by Elmore Leonard. I found this one in Shanghai last week, and it's not as good as all that, but it's readable enough. I wouldn't make a special point of finding it, though."
3,Altec Lansing Performance,"The sound produced by the Altec Lansing IM4 portable speaker system was adequate, although I expected better Bass response. The Volume was good compared to the built in speaker on my HP Pavillion. The size and compactness of the system was great. Very easily include in most laptop carrying bag. I also liked the dual power options. The system will run on 4 aa batteries ( not included ) or the supplied Ac Power adapter."
5,Altec Lansing IM4,Purchased the Altec Lansing IM4 for my wife so she could plug her Creative Zen W into it to have some external speakers with some decent volume. The unit works great and she loves it.
4,very nice set of travel speakers,"I spend a lot of time on planes and in hotel rooms, and my Zen Micro is a lifesaver. I wanted music in the hotel room, however, and bought these after some study.Sound quality is excellent, with good bass. Physical design is also very convenient: folds into a flat package, fits into a soft cloth bag, takes up very little room in my suitcase. When open for business, the non-slip plastic on the top of the center unit is an excellent place to set your music player. The plug-in is a short cord that retracts into the main unit when not in use.The external power adapater is an especially clever design, with 'snap in' plug adapters for US, UK & other AC plug types.May also be powered by 4 AA batteries, but in this regard I've had less luck: left the unit 'on' by accident when I unplugged it, and when I returned to my hotel room, the batteries were exhausted."
4,It Is No Stereo But........!,"If a person has a non Ipod MP3 player i.e. Creative, Dell, or Iriver and does wants to hear music out in the open the choices are pretty limited. The sound of these portable speakers are more extended than the Creative Travelmate in the bass and treble but still are a bit on the thin side sonically but what can you expect for $70 to $80? Dell is asking $100 for this product which is too much. The specs say that the bass goes down to 60 hz which I find hard to believe. Probably 100 hz is more realisitic. For listening to music while traveling or for casual listening in out of the way rooms of your home this is worth the money otherwise buy a real stereo."
4,Very durable,"I bought this about 4 years ago and they are still going strong. I've taken them overseas, in high heat areas, dropped them, etc. I like the fact everything is made of hard plastic and has a rubber padding on the bottom to prevent sliding. They are perfect if you are on the road. You can also install batteries for those long road trips."
2,Not good,"I bought and returned this item, of course still waiting to get my money. Sound is horrible. I bought this because I like Altec speakers a lot, but this turned out to be a worthless piece, not sure if I got the 1/100 bad pieces."
4,King of Hearts,As a former heart surgeon this book was delightful to read for the clear explanation of much of recent medical history and some of the sad personal details of Dr. Lillehei's personal history. A great story about a great human being despite his very human frailties.
1,Books showed up damaged and seller won't answer my emails or calls,"I am a professional in the medical device industry and I ordered two paperbacks of the King of Hearts to give as gifts to Cardiovascular Surgeons. The book itself is wonderful! However, when I received the books, they were packaged in a bubble envelope together with severe crease marks in both books. The seller will not acknowledge my voice mail or email. First and last experience purchasing books through Amazon!!"
3,Dr. Lillehei: A surgeon--but a man,I found the beginning of the book tedious at times. The author's need for accurate documentation made my mind wander. By the middle of the book things became more interesting and began to flow. The need for animal experimentation and human lives opens your eyes to the price of advancement in the medical field.
4,This satisfies your reading craving,"I was a bit apprehensive about reading a book based solely on open heart surgery at first. You see, I am the type who is squeamish about blood. However, when I delved into King of Hearts I found it to be the kind of book that you are oddly compelled to read. Right when I sat down I seemed to forget my surroundings. I was drawn to the stories of the men, women, and children who played a part in the quest for open heart surgery. The plot thickened as page after page turned beneath my fingers, and I anxiously awaited the climax . Isn't that what great reading is all about?"
5,"king of hearts, a great book","this book was both interesting and informative. it is about one of the first cardic surgeons, walt lillehei. he did so much for people yet so little is known about him. dr lillehei was such a complex man. it was fascinating to learn about his many different faces. i was impressed with the courage of the first cardic surgeons and the risks they took. this non fiction book held my interest the way a fiction book does. i would highly reccommend this book."
5,Page-Turning Bio of a Visionary Surgeon,"Written in a style so lively, you feel like you're reading a suspense thriller, KING OF HEARTS chronicles the life and achievements of Walt Lillehei, the heart surgeon who made open-heart surgery almost commonplace. His story is filled with daring vision, incredible hubris, pathos, and even wry humor. This book makes the reader appreciate the Promethean effort and daring the innovators of open-heart surgery assumed and perfomred on a daily basis. KING OF HEARTS is a heroic story featuring a larger-than-life character who wears his flaws as well as his accomplishments boldy on his sleeves. A must read!"
4,Beyond Acceptance - A Book,I bought this book for a friend of mine who appreciated it very much. I didn't read it through and through before I gave it to my friend but I did review chapters and felt it was a very thought provoking and insightful book.
3,Beyond Acceptance: Parents of Lesbians and gays Talk about their Experiences,I didn't find this book as informative as I thought I would. I found it to be a collection of exerts of letters by parents who have a gay child with a few opinions expert opinions thrown in. I was very disappointed with the content of this book.
4,Department 56 Snow Village Phone Company,This is a great addition to any holiday village display with the typical Department 56 attention to detail on the building itself. It comes with one phone pole and some wire to attach it to the phone company building. I would have given it 5 stars if it was designed to come with more phone poles and more wire to string throughout the little town.
3,Cute light read,"I have to disagree with the previous reviewer's 2-star rating. I'd give it a 3 and a half, if that were possible. It's true there is very little suspense in this story, and the 'mystery' is not all that important, but it is a cute, lightweight read - a pleasure. A favorite of mine - I've read it a few times - a nice diversion. You do have to like this particular kind of off the wall silly humor."
1,Disappointed,I bought this product and it took longer to receive than expected. I installed it in my Mustang and the clock did not work. I was told to send it to AutoMeter (my cost of $19 dollars) and I received a new one. I feel Amazon.com should have paid to send it to the dealer. Amazon made it clear for me to take care of the damaged product Disappointed!!!
5,Street Survivors,"A great cd from Lynyrd Skynyrd, Street Survivors. Even better the Deluxe Edition. Giving you extra tracks which are great. Also great service as well. Thank you."
2,"Interesting, but...","I've always loved this album. I was listening to it when news of the accident came on TV. If you don't already have the original version, this one is worth getting just for disc 1 and having a chance to listen to disc 2. But if it is the live versions of the songs form ""Street Survivors"" that you were looking forward to hearing (I was), you are better off getting the ""Freebird - The Movie"" soundtrack. The unreleased version is interesting, but at the price of this set, I'd think twice."
5,A Must-Have CD for certain,"Street Survivors is arguably their best CD featuring the incredible Steve Gains (who has co-lead vocals on You Got That Right). Throw in the 2nd CD (aka the ""Deluxe"" Part) and not only do you get original versions of most of those songs but you get some live versions as well plus a bonus track that I don't believe was ever released before. Great studio work plus, there is nothing better than Live Skynyrd. Like I said, a must-have CD........and worth the extra $ IMHO."
3,The infamous cover,"They might have been street survivor but not plane crash survivors. This is one of the biggest tragedies in rock and roll music to me. This album is awesome. It is a great listen for anyone who loves southern rock. My more favorite tunes on this album are not ones you would ever hear on the radio like ""aint no good life"".I will still be thinking what it? This album always brings back those memories."
1,SKIP THIS ONE,"TERRIBLE!! NOT JUST SOME PARTS - THE WHOLE THING WAS TERRIBLE. I REALIZE THAT THIS MOVIE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE A PLOT, BUT THIS ISN'T EVEN INTERESTING. NOTHING GOOD ABOUT IT"
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"The description of this so called movie is misleading. Do not waste your time or money. The ""acting"" is atrocious and the camera work is the same. I could not even get past 7 minutes before I turned it off, ejected it, broke the disk up into several pieces and threw it in the trash."
5,classic,"Think of this as bohemian chamber music for martians. This is an EP but despite short length and high price is worth every cent.The music here is based on strings and some light tablas. It is not twelve tone, and not Indian music either. But the unusual juxtaposing of instruments and the eccentric vocals make this highly original and compelling.The music floats on air--there is no percussion backbone, as the tablas work more as pepper to the strings and vocals, but the structure is extremely solid. You warm instantly, as this is so inventive, yet equally accessible.GET IT!"
4,Good resource,"I happened upon this title in my college town's used book-store and even though I had read (and owned) previous historical accounts of the GLBT movmenet, I was drawn to the fluid layout of the book.Befiting the sponsoring magazine's name, this book does not simply chronicle the past, but inspires readers to become contributors for a better future. Also helpful is the concious decision to focus on events in the entire country, as opposed to only the East and West Coasts.The only problem I had with the book was the selective ommission of interviews towards the present day. In 1993, Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain vocally expressed his support for GLBT freedom/opposition to Oregon's homophobic Ballot Measure 9 (among other progressive views) in a cover-story/interview, but nothing was mentioned about his influence on our generation in a time when the right was flush with zeal attempting these strategies, themselves trying to influence the youth vote."
1,Don't buy this garbage,"At the second oportunity to use this piece of garbage, I fill it just with ice in squares not bigger than 1x1 each dice, and no longer than 1 block walking with, it went ripping out by the left side showing the lining out. If you buy it this garbage is like throw your money in a rubbish cannister. Avoid to spend your money in this stuff. I remark than 1 star in my review is obliged it. This product doesn't deserve neither half a star."
4,So far so good,Big and spacious. My boyfriend works outside in construction for 12 hour days. He needed a new cooler that could hold all his drinks and snacks and keep them cool in the summer. So far we love the size of it and the convienence lid at the top. Hopefully it continues to hold up six months from now.
3,"Ok, but not as good as the old design","We used to own two older soft coolers from this same manufacturer, so decided to use them again after years of use. The new ones are cheaper construction, more difficult to fold, looser/sloppier lining and no compartment to hold a freezer pack. So, they work fine but the food can contact the freezer pack unless you lay sometihng over it. They were inexpensive, so I guess you get what you pay for. We'd probably look at other products to replace these in the future."
2,Unable to Select Colour of Cooler,Well I got this from Amazon and you are unable to select the colour/color of the cooler. I did want blue but got an ugly orange cooler. Lame but I well be using this cooler in 2 weeks so we'll see how it goes. I didn't notice any tears and this 36-can cooler didn't come with any partition inside. I'll be using it mainly for inside a hotel room where ice is plentiful.
4,cooler bag,"nice bag, keeps drinks cold all day, comes with a shoulder strap, and two external storage pockets, inside there is a removable divider, with a velcro lid on one side for easy access."
1,TRIFORCE MAKES CATS CRAZY,"I bought this for my cats who enjoy to go outdoors under my supervision. The minute I opened it, it came out very quickly and there was not enough to go on the recommended treated areas. My cats then began jumping around and constantly itching their necks. The smell is very strong, and it really irritated the cats fur and made them nervous. It alsmost seems as if it is too toxic. Next time I will spend a liitle more money so that my furry friends are not irriated with this cheap product."
3,"Works,... But need to follow-up","This product is only effective IF, You make sure to get rid of the fleas at all surrounding areas of your house. Otherwise your pet can be infested again after about a week."
1,did not work at all,"I received my product on time and in good condition, but the product did not work at all. In the future, I will know to just buy Frontline or Advantage and that I should not try to save money on these items."
4,Samsung TV Stand,"Great engineering. Can be used for sets ranging from 46"" to 56"". Good quality construction. The directions could be better. plan on taking sections apart and redoing them a few times. It took 90 minutes to assemble, but looks good and functions well."
5,DLP TV STAND,Got stand on-time and in good shape. It was easy enough for me to assembly in a short period of time. I like it and will order again from this site.
2,Great if you like overpriced stuff!,This is a nice $80 tv stand for over $200. It's not particularly well made and is not very stable. It doesn't exactly line up with my Samsung because it's made to fit several models/sizes. But it looks cool and you should consider buying one if you don't mind giving up your hard-earned money to help boost Samsung's profits.
4,Looks Good But Takes Time And Patience To Assemble,"The stand is sturdy and well constructed. It would have been better if the shelves were adjustable to allow me to stack my receiver and DVD player. You have to read and follow the instructions carefully to assemble it with the hex wrench that was provided. It is easy to make a mistake, if you don't look at the parts and identification labels carefully when laying out the pieces. It took about an hour and a half to assemble."
1,Beautifully designed; poorly engineered!,"I have used this stand for 5 months now. It matches the Samsung 67 series DLP TVS perfectly,but my TV is beginning to sag in the center, after only a few months of use, due to the lack of center support.Samsung is working with the manufacturer to develop a solution. The temporary fix I received from the manufacturer is inadequate, a couple of blocks to insert in the corners between the floating stand and the TV. There is stll no center support, and the TV will still bow. The manufacture could not tell me how long it will be until a newly designed top with support will arrive. I will have to keep checking back. Avoid this product until the problem is solved!"
1,An Excellent book for testing your beliefs.,"If you feel any part of this book is true, or maybe could be true, or is a little bit true you are either a non-believer, apostate or oblivious. The prevailing ignorance of todays ""christian"" allows this book to exist."
4,Hard-hitting exposition of the Real War,"I'm left with two senses after reading this book: (1) sadness licked with fear -- the world as we know and love it is disappearing, almost gone. At least in the West. (2) Resolve renewed and steeled that we can and MUST join the jihad against the Great Satan by embracing God's cause most earnesly in our personal lives (metanoia, charity) and in the public square. A particularly brilliant summary of what Christians can and must find in common with Conficianism, Buddhism, Islam, and Judaism. A delightful dialogue with Conficius, Buddha, Mohammed and Moses, as well as a trialogue with Martin Luther, Thomas Aquinas, and CS Lewis. Nothing is more urgent or more important, and Kreeft makes the case convincingly."
5,Light Enjoyable Mystery,This was an enjoyable light mystery that kept my attention throughout the book. I have just started reading the Regan O'Reilly books and look forward to read the other books in the series.
4,Decked was very entertaining,Again Carol Higgins Clark writes a great story for Reign Reily to solve. I would recommend this book to all my friends. i always look for Ms Clark's books everywhere. I have never been disappointed.
3,"Good story, bad editor.","Was this book even edited? For example, one of the characters is named Hardwick. In one paragraph it will be spelled Hard wick. In another it was spelled Hard-wick, and in some it was spelled correctly. There are many spelling, and grammatical errors, you get distracted from the story.My other issues are with the author. She is too wordy with her descriptions. The ""witty banter"" that the characters have together is just so ridiculous. I just think, ""has this woman ever had a real conversation with anyone?"" She also uses so many words that just make her sound pompous, like she is trying to show that she is smarter than the reader. One of my biggest pet peeves is that she uses septuagenarian and octogenarian, instead of just saying 70 or 80 year old.All in all, the story was good, but I will be looking for better author, while I wait for more books by Sue Grafton or Michael Connelly."
5,"Wonderful, witty, fun, refreshing! Excellent read!","This young author has been given the talent to hold her readers' attention. As I read this book, I was left wondering ""who dunit"". It's lighthearted, witty, trilling....well, you get the picture. The characters are first-class. The plot is original. I enjoyed this book because it was an excellent mystery and just plain fun to read. I didn't want to put it down until the end. Reagen Rielly is a refreshing change from the other P.I. She's a young woman made for the crime world. I indeed had a wonderful time reading this book. It's for anyone who wants a trilling, page-turning mystery."
1,snozzzzz,I found I couldn't keep from falling asleep trying to get into this book. I finally had to hang it up after the third chapter when it couldn't hold my interest. To be fair I did buy the first book after a friend raved about the 8th book because I wanted to get in on the beginning of the series. I guess Ms. Higgins-Clark got better as the sequels moved on but I'm not interested enough to move on with her.
2,"Not horrible, but okay","I admit that I read the book because of Carol Higgins Clark's mother, but the book wasn't horrible as I think all of us have read far worse. The problem with the book is that you won't really like any of the charachters and that causes a bit of disinterest. The pros are that the book has a plot but it lacks sparkle."
4,Loved it!!!!!!,A great page turner for anyone who loves a good mystery. This book will keep the pages turning while also keeping you on the edge of your seat!
2,dissapointed,"i bought this for my husband, as a gift, it was one of his favorite childhood toys, one of the boxers came with a defect, you can{t wind him, his legs get stuck so he doesn't fight... not that it was intended to be use for actual play, more of an office ornament."
3,Blah,"What I really wanted I never got from this book. While a nice, survey of the events of the cold war, never once, does the author attempt to explain the root of the conflict in the arena of ideas. Never does he try to go beyond political dogma. After reading an excellent biography of Eisenhower, which did much more justice to the small part of the cold war involved ...I found this work lacking. It is also particularly myopic in that the author never revised the work in view of the collaspe of soviet union as a whole."
4,"A ""Must-Have"" For Anyone Learning and Teaching the Old Ways","Stewart Farrar breaks down in detail the cycles of birth, death, and rebirth in his book. The necessity of learning the paths of the moon and the seasons soon reflects how many of us have lost our way in today's technological society.For those reaching back into time, to uncover the Old Ways, to bring them back to Today, this book is a good place to start. It is not the end-all be-all of sabbat books, but is suffiecient as as both a reference guide and a teaching manual.Stewart discusses not only the eight Holy Days of witches (members of the religion, Wicca), but also the holy ceremonies of Wiccaning (baptism), Hanfasting (marriage), and Crossing the Bridge (funereal).As a teacher of the Craft, I continue to assign this book to my students as required reading, and recommend it to anyone with the thirst to re-awaken to Old Ways."
4,Excellent Overview,"A compendium of Alexandrian rituals for the the Sabbats and Esbats throughout the year with nice summaries of what each represent. While it can be dry to read cover to cover, it makes for a very nice start in understanding each of the holidays as well as provides an excellent framework for practicing/crafting your own rituals."
2,One dry reading book,"This is one dry reading book. It is a good book I suppose but it is so dry and not much fun to read. It's a real grind to get through the pages and mostly it puts me to sleep. This book has a lot to offer but in the desert landscape it is in, I find it very difficult to read."
4,MJ Cole's distinctive sound is a cut above the rest,"Excellent, this is the last 3 years of UK garage building up in the underground and un-leashed to an international audience. The main tracks to look out for are ""Tired games"", ""Hold on to Me"" and ""Crazy Love"" with the immaculate voice of Elizabeth Troy on Vocals. ""Mj Fm Interlude"" takes you underground and into the pirate radio scene in London where UK Garage planted it's roots and of course not forgetting the tittle track ""Sincere"". This album definitely not for our average Cheezy raver and you have to have some sort of understanding of where the music is coming from to appreciate it, However for those who do it will certainly have you clucking for more !"
4,Artful..Sting being Sting,"Backed by an excellent band sting reworks a few of his old hits. This album would have been better were it not for the circumstances surrounding the date of its recording but still it is worth picking up if just for some of the beautiful, evocative tracks like ""Fragile"", ""A Thousand Years"", ""Perfect Love... Gone Wrong"", the old Police hits ""Don't Stand So Close To Me"" and ""Roxanne"". Unfortunately for US/Canada ""Mad About You"", perhaps the band's best (and most fun) performance, has been left out.Could have been better but all in all still an exceedingly worthy album"
4,Great recording of some intimate performances,"As others have mentioned, the performance on this live CD took place on September 11, 2001. As a result, it has a somewhat somber, introspective tone and doesn't include some Sting/Police work that might otherwise have been used, but seemed inappropriate in light of that day's events.The result, though, is a joy to listen to and worth putting on repeat in your CD player. The songs have all been re-worked to be more jazzy in their arrangement and instrumentation and several songs seem to have been given a complete overhaul.My only criticism is that two songs that were shown being rehearsed on the DVD weren't included on the music CD -- Mad About You (from the Soul Cages) and Desert Rose (from Brand New Day)."
1,"I wish ""0 Stars"" was an option","This is an awful CD, unless you want ""jazz lite"" which is what Sting's music has become. It just meanders emotionlessly from track to track, sounding more smug and self-congratulatory with each passing minute.Do not, under any circumstances, waste your money on this dog of a CD."
1,Worst Sting album I've ever heard,"I like Sting, but this is awful. The pacing seems too ""artsy"" and self indulgent for words. About the 60th time he repeated the same refrain at the end of I'll Be Watching You (Like he thought I couldn't get enough of it!) I snatched it out of the player and stuck it in my ""Sell"" pile."
3,I SO wanted to like this.....,".... and found myself responding in the same way I do to most of Sting's work: appreciating his talent as a composer, the superb arrangements and musicianship, the great sound/production values. But this work, like nearly all of it, leaves me cold - like watching a film performance where I never stop thinking about the actor and his career, rather than falling deeply for the character, the role, - or in Sting's case, the musical moment. It all feel so so calculated. I so wanted to like this one...."
5,Capturing a Daydream,"Having been a Sting fan for many years; I am still amazed at how little his creativity is mostly un-appreciated. For an artist to have the ability to steal our imaginations, and dreams, and turn them into songs is mind boggling. ""All This Time"" speaks volumnes in this area. I wish that more musicians would re-visit their older recordings. Props to Sting for speaking to my soul through his artistry. ""Fragile"", is one of the greatest songs ever written."
3,"its ok, lacking energy...","Perhaps due to the circumstances of the day it was recorded, this live disc is lacking ""life"", from the audience, from Sting.Featuring 13 of his most notable songs (excluding Denda and Hounds of Winter), Sting reworks most of them into jazz standards, sometimes it works, more often however it does not.As a great Sting fan, I was compelled to pick it up without delay, however All This Time is not intergal to your music collection."
2,"All this time..., and showing it","After a couple of listens, this strikes me as awfully lightweight. I can understand Sting was probably subdued given that the show was recorded on 9/11 but there's just not much here that demands future plays. The recording itself is excellent, and the song selection acceptable. However, in retrospect, Sting should have rescheduled this recording date for a time when the 9/11 tragedy was not so fresh, and likely to effect his performance. It's certainly interesting to contrast this with his earlier live album recorded after Dream of the Blue Turtles, which was far more upbeat. However, this performance just lacks the passion of his earlier works. I've been a Sting fan since early in his Police days and have seen him live 4 or 5 times, but this performance disappoints. This CD just seems to be another step in Sting's progression from an innovative ""new wave"" rocker to being a strictly adult-contempory artist."
1,Boring,"How does an exciting musician that has brought so much to the music industry become such a settled boring clone? The only answer can be that money has changed the man. And on a much louder note, how do his two sidkicks of Police become so unrecognized? The answer is they are not, and with a little leap of faith, you will pick up OYSTERHEAD instead of this weak album."
2,yawn....,"You know, I really wanted to like this album. Sting's last live effort, Bring on the Night, was outstanding. He had a crack band made up of some of the best contemporary jazz musicians around, and everyone involved turned in an inspired performance. On his latest effort, he's still got a great band, but this time it's as if they're daring you to fall asleep. One of the coolest things about a Sting concert is the way he reworks his material. He does that here as well on several tracks, but in every case, the original versions are better. Too often, he seems like he's just going through the motions. Even newer songs like ""Brand New Day"" (one of the best things he's written recently) are played at a faster tempo, as if he's just trying to get them over with. The songs themselves are the biggest problem, though. Sting has seemed determined to put us to sleep with his last few albums, and unfortunately, he continues the trend here. Recommended only you're having trouble sleeping."
1,.....all this time> what a waste of money,"Wow...I can't believe I wasted [dollar amount] on this cd! Sting let his fans down with this one. He goes off on this Jazz binge. I have been to many Un-Plugged shows and been super happy, but I would have been let down seeing this one. Sting needs to be in touch with his fans who made him rich and not think everyone will keep buying his music because he put it out. This cd is less than 12 hours purchased and getting exchanged. [...]"
4,Gordon Sumner meets Jazz,"I must say that this album is great. I was'nt a real fan of sting's until the released of ""Ten Summoner's Tales"" back in 93. Before, I had seen earlier police videos, but I did'nt really take any notice. So my taste in his music does not linger on his band from the early 80's for those of you who keep dragging the ""police"" stigma around ever time you review one of his albums. Over all, this album is great. I like the jazz reworking of his ealier stuff. The addition of Christan Mcbride (one of todays leading bassist) was and awesome idea. I would have preferred the extra tracks included in the U.S. release though. But still, I highly recommend this album."
5,GREAT!!!,This is definitely a must-buy cd. Every song on it is excellent. Every note brings out the heart and soul of one of the most talented singer/songwriters of our time. I have listened to this cd over and over again and it just seems to get better every time. I highly recommend it!!
2,rip off,"when i learned Sting was releasing a cd from the Tuscany show,i was thrilled since his live renditions are usually better than the studio versions.my happiness soon faded to disappointment when i learned of the 3 different versions.of course,the U.S. version has the least songs.just 15.europe version 17,japanese 18.so i ended up getting the japanese import....it just so happened that one of my favorite Sting songs""Seven Days""wasn't on the U.S.version.why do the record companies do that?5 Stars for the japanese version."
5,Always worth a listen,This is a very good collection of new interpretations of his work. Listen with a new ear.
5,"Forget Clapton, Sting is God","The man truly understands his music. Rearranging songs written decades ago into truly contemporary and jazz styles which will blow your mind, and give you renewed pleasure and interest in listening to them. The man is either one of the greatest musicians ever, or a great marketing genious and we're simply too dumb to recognize it. Either way, I'm thoroughly enjoying his music!"
3,Not what I was expecting.,"This album is ""interesting"" and ""different"" and contains a lot of gospel music. It's great from the cerebral, Sting-is-a-genius point of view, but for regular listening I prefer the albums."
3,Just didn't mesh,"Yes yes, kudos to Sting for trying something new--I mean, that's why we love him, right? But I just don't think this new sound meshes well with the old favorites. I know ""Roxanne"" too well to hear it completely redefined, and worse yet--you can't sing along to them. Maybe it's just my style preference, but don't expect to get misty-eyed hearing ""Every Breath You Take"" mixed up and sped up. I wouldn't reccomend buying this album unless you like the idea of combining Sting Classics with Jazz."
2,All this time and nothing new,I was hoping for some new moves on some old tunes but it was the same stuff I already have sitting on my shelves in my CD library.
2,Tired Sting ?,"Wow I wasn't exspecting him to redo these good songs and talk through half of them he even ruined his brand new day song. My advice, buy original recordings only, this one was tired and lazy by singer and band."
3,"Great definition, no detangler","Great curl definition. I have very fine, curly hair (read: frizzy) and this helps a lot. Biggest drawback is that unlike most curly hair conditioners, it doesn't have a detangler. The description claims it does, but if so, it is very ineffective. Also, for those who wonder since the description doesn't say- it smells like lemon meringue."
4,TIGI Catwalk Curls Rock Curly Hair Conditioner,This conditioning product worked well and has a pleasant fragrance. Was easily able to get a comb through my hair after use.
4,In The Folds Of The Flesh,"Highly recommended film, full of plot twists and intrigue. Definitely not for the kiddies. You got animal killings, decapitations, flashbacks of cyanide poisonings, etc.. Whatever disturbing thing you can imagine somehow ends up in this film. The transfer is widescreen and not bad for the material. Good value for the buck."
2,Overpriced,"Got this ""bargain"" in the mail today. Only $19.08 plus shipping. Shipping couldn't cost too much, since all that a buyer gets is a cd in a thin, flimsy carboard sleeve. No liner notes inside; nothing but the cd. I guess the producers couldn't afford to package the cd in a plastic jewel case. This is my third ""1964"": The Tribute purchase (all different) and this is the only one I would rate ""cheesey"". Buy the other versions, but skip this one and save the money for tickets to one of this band's concerts, instead."
4,"Even with all its faults, another treasure.","Vol.2 was good too, although sometimes I guess I'm a little too liberal with my reviews, oh well. Some episodes (once again) are better than others. The one where Dr.Arcane faces his demons in court was pretty funny, with Tressa Kipp as the judge. I do agree with another reviewer about storyline continuence and tying up loose ends, but even if they don't in Vol.3, I'm still happy to have finally seen the series in its entirety. We'll see what happens."
4,Less than volume 1,"The first Season was much better especially with some sort of storyline competency. The 2nd volume is a must for the collection, but Swamp Thing lost its soryline by dropping ""Jim."" The dropping of mutants was a plus, but its substitution was just not penciled well. However, I am greatly looking forward to the next volume."
5,A fun read,"This tiny book makes some fun reading on the sincere but hilarious kooks that parade and tout their money-making ""religions"" at your door and through your airwaves. Each ""religion"" is given an introduction and the irrationality of believing in each of them looks obvious. Not a comprehensive study though."
3,"academically interesting, but slightly dated","i've read a majority of this book as part of an english course. i would consider it reasonably well varied and interesting in the context of academia, but by no means groundbreaking or anything i wouldn't expect. this is a collection of papers about the internet, generally with emphasis on sociology, so this isn't exactly leisure reading. it is also becoming slowly dated -- today's frequent users of the internet will find this book as only support for now common perceptions about the internet which may have been new at the time of writing. it also lacks any articles on media invented since the book's writing and now commonplace, such as instant messaging."
2,intereresting material but title incredibly missleading,"The title of the DVD is ""Brain Fitness Program"" and if you read the back cover it suggests that you are going to get an excercise program designed by ""50 leading scientists to help improve your brain"" . However when you actually get the dvd it is simply an hour long documantary about recent studies showing that the Brain can be improved. Nowhere on the dvd is any ""fitness program"" or any ""mental excersizes"". I am surprised at this being that it was originally a PBS show and yet it comes across as a bit if an hour long promotion or infomercial and by the end you are interested and intrigued and also angry at the lack of the ""program"" that the title and description seem to promise.Oddly the only place they refer to an actual program is in the title and back cover. The people in the documentary don't really even refer to it. I did enjoy the documentary but I felt ripped off."
1,The Brain Fitness Program,"After watching the program on PBS, I thought the DVD would have the brain exercises, which it didn't. I was disappointed."
4,"Great Documentary, Misleading Title","This is a fascinating documentary about the human brain, how it functions, how it ages, and how to slow that process. However, the title is misleading. I was expecting specific exercises to sharpen the viewer's mind, maybe some memory or concentration drills. But there is none of that on the disc. The viewer is left to pretty much figure out what to do on their own, although it is mentioned that physical activity helps keep the brain younger.There are several extra features running from 1-25 minutes each, which may be leftover material from the main feature. A ""play all"" feature should have been included for those, since all together they are less than an hour.If you enjoy documentaries, such as programs that run on the Discovery or National Geographic Channels, this is an interesting study of the brain. If not, you may find it dry or boring.If you're looking for an actual brain fitness program with exercises to do, this is not it."
4,"interesting, informative","Entertaining and full of good info, presented at a level anyone can understand. Well done. I use it for a graduate psychology class as the concepts are very current."
1,Brain Fitness Program,"Three years ago, after seeing the documentary on PBS, I paid $400 for the full program. It was forty, 1-hour interactive sessions, and I saw a definite improvement in my memory. I would love to go through it again, but we switched from PC to Mac and I don't think it is available in Mac."
3,Balance Sticks for Brain Fitness,The Brain Fitness series on PBS was packed full of information that supported the work I do with clients in the field of Therapeutic Recreation.I use and supply a brain exercise instrument that is not only good for your brain and your body but it is fun for all ages and abilities! For $25 - $50 you can get a set of Balance Sticks for real Brain Fitness and an instructional video at www.simplyamazingkids.com. Navagate through my web pages and you will see the scientific and therapeutic connection to my work and the Brain Fitness series on PBS.
2,"Beautiful, BUT Flawed","No doubt staub makes a beautiful pot. The problem is poor design. Why? The metal-chrome-plated handles are attached to the pot in a way in which the handles form a loop around a peg on the pot. As part of the pot, this peg is ceramic coated cast-iron. As the metal handle opens and closes, the chrome metal rotates on the ceramic painted pot. You don't need to be an engineer to figure-out that chrome-metal rotating on ceramic paint is clearly an area of high-wear which will rust-out in the long run. Mine started to wear with only 3 openings of the handle. Hope they fix this design. This pot gets five stars for aesthetics, one star for functional durability for the reasons just noted."
4,Teatime for Lumberjacks!,"This kettle is beautiful. It is absolutely an industrial pick, though. If you want tea and an upper body workout, this is your kettle. When I pour for cocoa and tea, I can feel the muscles across my shoulders getting involved. I will keep this forever and die strong."
4,"Liked the pot, the color was a little less vibrant than one I had previously seen.","Looks good in a cherry wood kitchen, is heavy duty and practical. It keeps your water pretty warm for a ""tea touch up""."
4,very good but not great.,it does everything great but the top of the picture needs some work it's not fasend. keeps falling off.
3,good but...,"at least they lost the clock... but what is with the new filter... i liked a usage meter... the bottom cracks easily and can flood your fridge nicely... i want to know, with the plastic filter and the repetitivly cooled and warmed plastic body, how many dioxins et al the system adds to the filtered water?"
3,light pitcher but fragile,"It is light weight and easy to handle. But after 2 months, it started to leak. The bottom had a crack. It was never droped to the floor. The bottom hit the sink or the dishes inside the sink occasionally when I filled it. I guess the crack was created by such contacts with the objects in the sink. So the bottom is not strong. Consider the height of the pitcher, its bottom is easy to touch the dishes in the sink. I am looking for another water picther with a bit thicker bottom."
5,"Clean, Clear Water","I like this better than the other brand that I had before. It filters more bad out of the water than the other one did. The water is so clean & clear with no odd taste. The bottle is nice and thin so it fits nicely into the refergerator. It is a little slow for the water to filter but, well worth the wait. Pur is the only brand that I will buy."
4,PLEASED,"LOOKED AND lOOKED, THIS WATER PITCHER WITH FILTER SEEMED TO FIT OUR NEEDS AND WE HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH IT, TO DATE. SURE BEATS THE PRICES OF BOTTLED WATER AND NO PROBLEMS AT ALL. WE HAVE HAD IT FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND USE IT ALL THE TIME. WE DO RECOMMEND IT...AND WE ARE FROM MAINE AND TAKE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS, VERY SERIOUSLY."
4,A little small,"I found this pitcher a little small and I am the only one that uses it. My solution, a three dollar plastic pitcher from the grocery store which I keep full with filtered cold water. Yes, this is a hacky solution in retrospect I would have gotten a filtered pitcher with a bigger reservoir. But the pitcher does what it is supposed to and works great."
5,Excellent but smaller than you think,"I've experienced no problems with this product after three months of nightly usage. I will tell you that it's worth it to get a larger pitcher as this one can only fill about 2.5 glasses. If you're eating dinner with a friend, you'll find yourself resorting to tap water with this tiny pitcher. At first I noticed a slight chemical taste not present in Brita filtration but after a couple weeks either the taste went away or I became desensitized to it. Excellent product, no problems."
5,A classic,"Great Album, Freebird ROX! This is one of Skynyrd's Best Albums, Classic Skynyrd through and threw, not any of the boring ""Vicious Cylcle"" crap that Johnny wrote. I should mention that the viewer who gave this album 1 star (Himo Pohonen) never gave any of the items he has reviewed more than 3 stars. He is clearly biased and only likes Led Zeppelin(Not that liking Led Zeppelin is a bad thing, thier cool). Buy this album, Second Helping, or 1 More for the road, stay clear of any Skynyrd album made past 1987."
5,A classic among classics!,"Pronounced by Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd, is one of the greatest albums ever made its as simple as that! Every song here is a classic! This is Lynyrd Skynyrds best album ever, hands down! Not a weak moment. Even the demos of 'FreeBird' are good!'Freebird,' well what can you really say about it? Its one of the greatest songs ever made! Amazing lyrics, great slide guitar at the beginning, and the guitar solo! Oh my God the guitar solo is just....its...just damn insane is what it is! ITs over the top and more. Its got build and everything a solo should have its just great.Dont get me wrong all the other songs on the album are great two but its kinda hard to stand out when you are on the same album as 'FreeBird'"
4,took a while but it came,I didn't realize this seller was in the UK. Guess I should have read the fine print. Despite being delayed in the mail I received item just as described. Seems like a good company just be patient.
4,"......excuse me, but.........",i find it odd that none of you jackasses mention the name 'al kooper'....
5,LYNYRD SKYNYRD ARE FANTASTIC,"LYNYRD SKYNYRD WERE THE GREATEST SOUTHERN ROCK BAND ALONG WITH THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND AND THEY MADE SEVERAL TERRIFIC ALBUMS WITH ANTHEMS LIKE FREE BIRD,SWEET HOME ALABAMA,GIMME THREE STEPS,TUESDAY'S GONE,SIMPLE MAN.THEY ARE BETTER THAN GUNS N ROSES BY A MILE.GET ALL THEIR ALBUMS.ignore the one star reviews for this album."
5,From an old timer..........,"........ who has been with Skynyrd from the beginning. Between '73 and '75 I saw them live twice in San Diego, while I was still in the Navy, and 3 or 4 times since then, both the original group and the rebuilt one. If I had to describe the authenticity, and brute HONESTY of this band, I would simply quote something Ronnie said in an interview way back when. The interviewer asked him why he always performed bare-foot on stage, while performing. His reply was awesome: ""Because I want to feel the stage BURN under my feet. I need to feel the HEAT!"", or words very similar to that (the interview was a long time ago). There was not an ounce of fake in the man, anywhere, nor in his band. Remember the man, and save a thought for Steve Gaines, his sister Cassie, Leon, Billy, Allan, and Hughie, also. Don't ever forget Hughie. Thanks for your attention......."
5,Chicago Cutlery Steak Knives,"These are a good quality non-serrated steak knife. I personally can't stand serrated knives unless they are for bread. These sharpen well and keep a good edge (especially if you use an electric sharpener like the chefschoice models). I have noticed some rust spotting occasionally, but I've found that it's usually from other utensils that are by it in the dishwasher and it wipes away without leaving any kind of pitting. Good stuff."
2,Internet Security Suite,"I've been happy with the AV in this suite, but the firewall has been a nightmare to install, or should I say fail to install, as I have not been able to get it to install. I had been using the free version zone alarm, but now that will no lnger work or re-install either after the failed install of the ca firewall. What a mess....."
5,"Solid, flexible and perfect for trim/panel removals","I bought these un-reviewed as the Neiko brand similar tools shared much of the same feedback; the Neiko brand was too flexible.I am glad I took my leap. These OTC tools were perfect for my task; fixing a broken door handle and broken window limiter (electric window rails/holder).These tools are firm and perfect for removing wood trim and door panels. Nothing got broken in my car using these tools and they were invaluable in getting the job done right the first time.The set includes a full range of tools and the tool ends work on many different jobs (disconnecting fittings for example). They are all plastic and won't scratch or damage your car/paint.I highly recommend these as I've used them twice now, even fixing a broken fuel hatch spring on my wife's truck.Every do-it-yourself-er needs these in their arsenal."
4,An interesting read into the minds of those that were there,"Really interesting book if you're interested in Japanese culture. The book is divided into the victim's stories, a bit of Murakami's perspective on Japanese society, and finally a few testimonies from Aum followers themselves.It was really interesting but a little long-winded reading through the victim section, a bit cumbersome going through Murakami's bit, and really interesting looking at it through the eyes of Aum followers themselves.It was a really good read and I recommend reading it if you are interested in, or living in Japan. A lot of the stories gave pretty good insight on the Japanese way of thinking. I found myself thinking many of the contributor's responses as 'so Japanese'. Good book."
4,"Great story, annoying errors","This book is amazing. It's a very touching story showing the thoughts and feelings of victims of this event no one can imagine going through. I read it all in two days. The only reason I gave this four stars is because the Kindle version has so many errors and it's quite annoying. Words are misspelled (came is spelled carne once) and there is weird punctuation and things. However, the story is great and definitely a good read."
3,Underground,"A valuable glimpse of the Japanese psyche and the effects of impure Sarin dispersed by terrorists. The difference in signs and symptoms, as the impure Sarin was inhaled @ varying concentrations, brought new insights to nerve agent chemical exposure and it's effects."
3,not creamy,"the texture was like eating broken pieces of rice in liquid. I did not enjoy it at all by itself or with milk, sugar due to this."
3,Thick!,"I have had many different kinds of farina, but this one is thick! I keep experimenting with the amounts of water. Very paste like. Maybe needs more maple syrup?? =)"
3,"Sent by mistake, but won't take back!","I ordered Bob's Red Mill Organic Brown Rice Flour for my Fiancee to make organic dog biscuits for our older dog on a diet. I got this instead and since It is food I am stuck with it. Not sure how it is fair that I got charged for what I DID NOT order and cannot return it either, but that is the facts and I am STILL looking for someone that eats it."
4,alternative to oatmeal,"It's easy to make, a warm cereal for someone who does not tolerate oat or wheat. I whip an egg in it & add fruit & honey. Makes a wholesome breakfast."
4,Space saver that does the job,"I lap swim 3 times a week and used to take an old bath towel which went right into the laundry and took up lots of room in my swim gear bag. This dries me off just fine, takes up way less room, and I simply rinse in clear water and hang to dry at home and only launder every other week. It's large enough to wear as a turban around wet hair. It's not wide enough to wrap around female full torso for modesty. Tip: I waited till I ordered something else and would have to pay shipping, then added this item to qualify for free shipping so I got it for about half price. If you are looking to buy a Speedo swim gear bag this type of towel might allow you to get by with the smaller bag."
2,Not a good swimmer's towel,"I bought this for my daughter, who's just started diving. All of the divers have swim towels. I thought this was a bargain because it's less expensive and much larger than standard swim towels. Well, it just doesn't do the job. It's not very absorbent, doesn't wring out as well as the other divers' towels. Her coach suggested a Nike or Speedo towel. Waste of my money!"
2,Could be better,I have an Aquis brand towel that is quick drying but much more absorbent. This towel basically just pushes the water around on your body instead of soaking it up. Also it is really small for the price. This purchase was for use at swim team practice. Not very impressed.
4,"works, easy to pack",This towel is the size that it's advertised and works fine to towel off quickly when getting out of the pool.
5,Dries as promised but it's tiny!,"This is not a beach towel by any means, it's got a couple of inches on a hand towel. It does much better when you throw it in with your wet swimsuit in a bag than a regular towel, though, and it's very easy to carry. Also, the towel definitely stands the test of time."
4,perfect,the towel is perfect for aqua sports its is soft and big compare to others towels. I recomendd
3,Just righ for the price,Towels from REI can absorb more. I absorbs water okay. It is just right for the price I guess....
4,Great for the price; get bigger size,"The towel is very absorbent and has a tiny footprint (storage). I use it at the gym and when traveling. It is easily <10% of a regular towel's volume. I would get a larger one next time, since it won't add that much to the towel's occupancy in my bag."
3,Cheap for a reason,"I bought this towel andAquis Adventure Microfiber Towel, Graphite, Medium (15 x 29-Inches)at the same time, and I think the Aquis towel is worth the extra money. This towel is fine, but I think it's a little on the small side and doesn't dry as well as the Aquis one."
1,DIMENSIONS ARE CONFUSING,"Wanted to order this item but looking at the product description on the Dimensions it says""A full 16"" x 32""- One of the largest towels on the market""Then further detailed description below item statesProduct size : 9"" x 2.3"" x 2.3""These two dimensions are such a huge contradiction. The saving factor for not buying is to read reviewswhich indicate it is a small little piece and NOT a large towel...Sigh... !"
1,Shazam,Just ordered this product ... Hope it is a good product and works well for my truck ... By the way buddy who says that his remote only works from 10 foot away ... Try moving your sensor wire some where else ...
5,Long Live the Champ!,"'Champ' is one of my favorites, a laugh-out-loud book with a lot to say about the state of social thought and behavior. Jim Riva has a definite (if somewhat unconventional) knack for telling a tale (check out his 'The Geographer'), and his major characters are unique, to say the least, and likeable in an eccentric-relative sort of way. In the course of this romp through small-town America (or is it? ), the 'superhero' Champion of Reason takes on the small-mindedness of every dogmatic thought system plaguing modern society. Riva draws things together in a satisfying way, and when you finish you'll be ready to start again."
5,Great book,"This is a great book, if you know about cisco. Is perfect to estudy for the certification"
4,"Well organized and written, but has one problem","This is a very handy book to keep on a network admin's desk. Shows the format and meaning of many Cisco IOS commands for routers and switches. It could be better - like many Cisco Press books, it lacks an index. Other than that, it's a great book to have around."
5,Excelente material de ayuda rápida,"Excelente producto, conciso, de forma rápida es posible ubicar los temas de interes para resolver algún topico especifico, facil de llevar a las áreas de trabajo, material resistente. Lo recomiendo."
3,CCNA Portable Command Guide (2nd Edition),It has all the commands you'll need but it's not very user friendly. You have to go through every chapter to find a command. An index would be nice to lookup the specific command you're looking for.
5,Excellent,"This product only has one word to describe itself, ""EXCELLENT"". If you really want to have a bonifide supplemental reading to what ever Cisco Training your pursuing...this will definitely suffice all of your ambitions and endeavors. Not only does the author make the material legible and understandable, he simplifies it by giving real world application (which is the best type of training in my eye)."
5,CCNA Portable Command Guide (2nd Edition),I was very happy with my purchase of this book. The seller' descriptions of this item was spot-on. And I would purchase other items from this seller. Keep up the good work. Thanks
2,Wait Before You Buy,"This book has some valuable information in it. However, it is probably an obsolete book because everything you need is readily available online using your smartphone, iPad, computer, etc. If you can't find what you need without this book, you probably need to find another occupational pursuit."
3,Very helpful,The ccna portable command guide seems to have a lot of commands but not all. As well the index is somewhat non existent. I was hoping for an index that would show me specific commands and the page number to find the command. For example: show ip route pg. 75. You kind of have to fish through book to find what your looking for. Not the fastest command reference guide but it has most of what you need.
4,Great book,"explain every subject in the ccna test in a nutshell, really good to have this book next to you when configuring your network, Great Desktop Reference book,"
4,Great!,It came in well packaged and actually a good 3 to 4 days early. The ring looks better in person and it fits perfectly. If this is the type of thing you're interested in I 100% recommend it!
3,It was okay,"I bought this ring cause I love sunflowers. I'm a size 7 in rings, so that's what I bought, and it was too large. And the wrong size is not grounds to have them pay for the return. It also seemed like the stones would fall out over time, but I didn't keep it long enough to see if they would."
5,It helped me...,"I found this book to be quite helpful in alleviating those third year jitters. So much of the third year is spent trying to figure out your role on the team, and how to look like a star. This book gives some useful pointers.If you have liked other books from the First Aid series, this book will also be well liked and used. Well written and to the point.Each chapter gives pointers for a particular clinical rotation - explaining the role of a student as well as who the typical other team members will be. Also, gives a general breakdown of what to expect for a typical day.Each chapter then has some vital clinical information that you need to know for each rotation. The chapters end with a review of which text books are most helpful for you to read.Good book!"
3,"Ok, but you will definitely need other books.","This book is far from comprehensive. If you only read this book for your clinical rotations, you would without doubt fail the rotation shelf exam, and probably not impress your residents/attendings. The only use for this book was to read before starting a new rotation to get a general overview before proceeding on to read other sources such as the blueprints book."
4,Plasma TV's,"This TV has one of the best pictures I've ever seen on any TV. It also has great stereo or 3D mono, whichever sound you prefer. The only drawback that I've seen with my TV is the power consumption. I haven't been able to find a source for the watts consumed, but one thing I know for sure...my power meter REALLY speeds up when I turn this TV on! I also have a 32"" LCD TV and it consumes so little power, the power meter never changes speed when I turn it on. If anyone has any information about the watts or amps used by this Samsung TV, PLEASE post a comment."
1,Don't buy this product,"Don't buy this product! The picture of the thermal air brush on the website shows a chrome-type barrel with bristles coming out of round holes in it. That is the reason I purchased it. I received a totally different type of brush with some rows of stiff plastic bristle-type things and some rows of thick horse-hair type bristles. It was blue, not chrome, and had long vents instead of round holes. I CAN'T EVEN USE IT --IT LEAVES RIDGES IN MY HAIR! I feel this was gross misrepresentation and am toally dissatisfied."
2,It's ok...,"I like the fact that it's dual voltage. I bought it mostly for travel, but at 110 it just takes too long to dry my short hair! Hope it's better at 220--haven't had a chance to try it yet."
1,"Conair 1 1/4"" Hot Air Thermal Brush","I was very disappointed in this product and do not even use it. A few years back I had purchased a Conair Hot Air brush that was remarkable but this is nothing like it at all. It gets tangled in your hair, does not heat up like the first one I had and does not even look like the first one.I would not recommend this product and would be happy to return if I could get my money back."
4,A hard-to-find blast from the past...,"I've search many places for 'Before you turn off the lights'. Michele before she blew up, Tha Dr. (Dre)and remnants of NWA. There were also forgotten treats, like 'Cabbage Patch'. This album took me back and I'm glad I purchased it..."
1,A Recipe For Disaster,"A poor choice....period.The author is an arrogant, egomaniacal ""expert"" who never stops blowing his horn about how qualified he is to assess and treat ADD in adults while portraying them as a sad lot of aimless, undisciplined human beings in need of his ""boot camp"" and ""tough love"" directives. Fat chance.I can only wonder how many ADD adults chose this title, believing it credible, only to be repulsed by the tone of Glenn Hunsucker's smarmy self-satisfaction and caustic diatribe.It's the very worst choice any man, woman, or child could make for assistance in living with and managing ADD and it's my sincerest hope you never heed a single word from this volume of vitriol if you had the misfortune of actually reading Unfulfilled Potential. It's that bad.And yes, I read every word."
3,A little stiff,Good quality however need to be softer and certainly can only be used by a larger adultGood for both swimming and using power tools
2,Disappointing...,The plugs are fairly dark in color and not nearly as translucent as the image made them appear. They are also very rigid and difficult to keep in my ears during routine pool swims.
5,good stuff,i get frequent ear infections any time i get water in my ears. i took these to a water park and they worked perfect. They are very soft and wont make your ear sore.
3,Popped out!,"As soon as I started swimming and popped up for water, I realized that one plug had fallen out despite having tightly secured it in! The other one remained in my ear, so I had to alternate; the one I had left, however, did work rather well."
2,Comfortable. Just need to work better.,"I have a few sets of Speedo earplugs. They hurt, but they work.These are very comfortable in comparison. But one of them failed to keep all of the water out of my ear, letting just a wee bit in. I have a hole in my eardrum... so I'll take a little discomfort to avoid any water getting in there.Worth trying, as they're $5, and your ear may be shaped differently than mine."
3,"Good for plane, OK for swimming","I purchased these ear plugs to use while practicing my open water swim. They keep the water out, but they stick out pretty far. (I have small ears.) They were also comfortable, but my arm would sometimes bump them while swimming my laps. They did keep noise out so I use them while traveling."
3,Some very snug ear plugs!,"I use these plugs to study in noisy houses and in noisy restaurants. They work really well, almost too well. I find that they create a lot of suction when they seal. Almost to the point that if I remove them too quickly I am afraid I may also remove an ear drum. Still a very good product and value."
5,Not my first pair of Aqua Sphere's Ear Plugs,I have a hole in my eardrum. I have been using ear plugs since I was 7 years old. These are the first and only pair to 1)Never fall out and 2) never let the water in. They do their job perfectly and they are very comfortable. I have even went so far as to have gotten an ear mold for personalized ear plugs and these are better than them. Great job Aqua Sphere. Never gonna trust anything else.
3,Keeps water out but doesn't stay on well,"Had the same problem with these ear plugs as I have had with several others that I have tried before. The ear plugs are hard to keep in the ears and keep coming loose after only a lap or so. While they're on, they work great and keep water out. But as soon as they become loose, there are small pockets where water gets in. Not sure what other product I should be buying that will not have this problem."
3,keep the water out,"these are good earplugs, but sometimes difficult to get into place. once in place, they work great. easy to see b/c of color, in case you drop one."
2,Don't fit in ear well,"Of course ear plugs should be obvious on how to use them, but I tried many ways and they just didn't fit in my ears very well. I ended up going to the local grocery store and getting the wax earplugs and those keep the water out for about the same price..."
3,Not a Happy Lesbian Movie,"Don't let the trailer fool you, that was the only happy clip. This movie was downright depressing and ended abruptly in a disturbing manner. Nazi invasion of France, lot's of fear and hiding, strangely open lesbian relationship, more fear, extremely rude ss officers and.. more general sadness. Also, movie begins suddenly with no opening title or anything. I do not think it was edited to be streamed correctly. If you want an okay nazi regime france takeover movie with a lesbian twist, watch this, it's not poorly made, but it's not joyful."
1,A painfully bad production,"The premise is good, but the film is not. The scene shifts are abrupt; the transitions, non-existent. The acting? Christiane Millet (Férial) shines in scenes that do not involve Gabriele Osburg (November). Gabriele Osburg never shines. She's just awful. (Not surprisingly, Millet has made a number of films; Osburg, three.) The women simply have no chemistry. The characters they play are supposedly passionately in love with each other, but their attempts to portray and convey that passion are stilted and contrived.A side note. The quality of the DVD is terrible: it is quite literally VHS on a disc."
1,Not Good,"I found this movie to be quite depressing. This film does not have a flowing plot- nor even an artistic plot. It is possible that budgetary constraints as well as technical ones (given the year it was filmed) had a great impact on the film. All in all, the film lacked an amount of believability. The ending was harsh."
3,pretty watch,"It is pretty, but It gets dirty very easy. I have a very small wrist, then it is big for me."
4,"I liked it, but I'm a DeLuise fan","Then again, if you're thinking of buying this there's a good chance you're a fan too.Cute made for TV movie, predictable but enjoyable. DVD comes with commentary by Dom, Carol and David DeLuise, also worth a listen."
3,McQ,"Excuse me but I don't speak english and I buy yours DVD only , when are subtitles in french. For this reason,I talk about McQ in french. C'est un excellent film policier réalisé par un director de talent, John Sturges dont j'apprécie toujours les films (The Magnificent Seven, Bad Day at Black Rock, Backlash, Gunfight at the OK Corral etc.) Il est aussi brillant dans les westerns que dans ses autres films d'action comme celui-ci. John Wayne qui a démissionné de la police, est embauché par un ami détective privé. Il va se lancer dans une passionnante enqute sur un trafic de drogue dont les commanditaires ne sont pas ceux que l'on croyait Malgrè l'ge et la maladie, John Wayne a beaucoup de présence dans ce film qui comporte une scène de poursuite très réussie"
4,John Wayne Legnndary Collection,"What can you say about movies with the Duke?I love the Duke's movies.I now have more than 75 Titeles in my DVD collection, Plus some colerized copies taken from TCM And AMC. I have edited the commercials out and burned them to DVD. I also have many of these on VHS tape."
3,Paul Desmond Not On It,"Despite the listing, Paul Desmond is not on the Immortal Concerts CD. The cuts are from Montreux Switzerland, July 22 82, with Dave, Bill Smith, CHris Brubeck and Randy Jones."
5,Sounds for Summer,"If you like the Beach Boys and especially Brian Wilson's solo work, then you will absolutely enjoy this double CD of Chris Rainbow's. Guaranteed.This package, with its beautiful harmonies and well constructed songs is an ideal listening experience on a hot summers day, driving in the countryside or down to the shore with windows down.I've been listening to a lot of these tracks since 1980 and they are still as fresh and vibrant as the day I first heard them. Search out his website for further information on this talented singer/songwriter. Highly recommended. (I mean it!)"
2,NOT the Orignial Memphis Belle Documentary,"This in NOT the orginial Memphis Belle documentary! This is a British remake/rehash of the original with altered narration and altered editing.It appears most of the original footage is included (I _wish_ I had the orginal to compare--it's the one I thought I was getting), but the original narration has been replaced, eliminating some of the most affecting parts (the WWII blood-donor pitch, for one--about how blood donations from the folks at home might have saved some of the returning wounded fliers), as well as the first-hand, on-the-scene sense of tension that the original had.This version isn't terrible, and does continue the Memphis Belle story past their successful final bombing mission, and includes some extra b&w; footage. But is--I repeat--NOT the original."
5,An excellent documentary,"There were many war time documentaries put together during world war two. Many were either not very good or were pure propagandafilms. But this one, along with a few others, stand out. They did an excellent job depicting the events covered and the peopleinvolved. And when you get right down to it, that is about as high of praise as can be given to a documentary.This is the story of the Memphis Belle, her crew, and to an extent, the others in their airbase and airgroup. Real life in a badsituation."
5,Life is What You Make It,"The Memphis Belle says it all. In war the winds of death blow each way you turn and it holds true in everyday life. We've got to work with the team, not against it. Some of us will make it, some wont'.The crew of the Memphis Belle was a team and a team has to work together in war if you hope to win the battle against an enemy you can't see. Somebody always gets hurt. But with a little help from your crew mates you can make it. In war life and death are always staring you in the face, telling you don't count on anything. If you make it call it luck. In war you live or die. Nobody knows if you're going to make it. In my case I made it. I was lucky. The guys on the Memphis Belle made it. They were lucky. It could have gone the the other way, like the plane that got cut in two by a damaged enemy plane.War is the great enemy. Whoever wins turns out to be a loser.Call it luck on a plate of ice.Best wishes."
1,There are Rocks in My Socks,The book is still as wonderful as it always has been. The condition of the book is what was disappointing to me...The binding was torn off on the top. And several pages had been heavily colored on. Is there any rating system in place when you put a used book up for sale that you could rate its condition so the buyer would have some idea what condition the book is in before purchasing it?
2,A Terrifying Glimpse into the Animal Kingdom,Imagine the sheer terror your unsuspecting child will feel when the little tyke opens this book to discover images of gangrenous limbs made raw by inferior footwear laden with stones. Oh the horror! God forgive us. God forgive us all.
5,Out Loud Fun,"This book is a tongue-twisting, ham-it-up with funny voices and sound effects, must for anyone who reads to children. The words themselves roll from the tongue in sheer joy; and although there may be deeper messages in the book, it's just plain fun to read. I've seldom found a book I enjoyed reading out loud more than this one, and I can't wait to read it to my granddaughter!"
4,Fun for younger children learning to identify rhyming words.,"I have lost my personal copy of this wonderful book and I miss it as I would a good friend. My students want to hear the story over and over again -- and I never tire of reading the comical verses written by Patricia Thomas. Our library, thankfully, still has a ""well-loved"" copy."
1,This book is missing the personal experiences of a memoir.,"After reading the book, I had very little insight into what the author's direct experiences were. The book would have benefited from descriptions of what exactly happened to him."
4,My father was a member of the same battalion & company.,"I have enjoyed the book because my father was a member of the 692nd TD Battalion, Company A. On page 172 it tells of the time Dick Potts was nearly killed. He was pulled to safety by my father, the driver of Potts tank, and his assistant driver.Parts of the book are a little hard to follow and I too would have liked to hear more of the day-to-day details of this ""journey"". My father told me some of his experiences but there is much more I would like to know. He passed away last June so I am searching other sources to find information."
4,Kept my daughter interested,"I bought this one along with another forensics book when she first started showing an interest in forensics. The other book failed where this one succeeded. The material was written well enough to catch her interest, and the stories were well told. As far as forensic detail, she said it was a little lacking, but that it was still fun to read and kept her interested in the subject. If you're looking for textbook type writing, this isn't it. It's not a research tool. But it is fun, and it should make for a good read if you like the nuts and bolts of how the science helped solve crimes."
5,Makes CSI come to life,Good to see that science can be used in the cases and solve them in some cases.
3,Don't think the author had all his facts straight,"It's an entertaining book, but I don't know how factual it is. The identification of the Romanov remains is not the same story as in ""Dead Men Do Tell Tales"" and a Discovery channel special I watched. The author claims four different times in the book that ""this is the first case in which a man was convicted without a body."" I don't think the author checked all his stories thoroughly or else I don't think his grasp on forensics is enough to understand and relate the cases he is describing. But it's an interesting read."
4,page turner; bit sparse,"I really liked this book. It was one of those 'can't put it down situations.' I am now looking for more material on the subject though because this book is a bit sparse. After reading each case one is left wanting more. Each case occupies only about 2 or 3 pages and though they are good, I would have liked to go more in depth. Alas, I do not think that was the author's intent. Very good, quick read."
3,A Basic Intro to the Realm of Forensic Science,"The book is a basic introduction into the multiple aspects of forensic detection. While well-written, I was hoping for a bit more detail as to the technical processes utilized to analyze the evidence. I would recommend the book, albeit not to someone in the field. The book is a nice overview of the history of the field of forensic science."
4,The Evaluation,The casebook of Forensic Detection is a very detailed book with great description.My daughter enjoyed it very much.
3,Casebook of Forensic Detection,The book is very complete in the author's normal style. The cases are sorted according to forensic evidence type. Most of the cases are pretty old though.
3,Interesting case studies in forensic science...,"As someone who finds forensic science interesting, I found this book to be entertaining. Unfortunately, some of the stories I already knew about from watching forensic science shows such as ""The New Detectives"". This was probably the main drawback for me. Otherwise, many of the stories were quite interesting. If you enjoy forensic science, I think you will enjoy this book. However, if you're like me and have watched many shows with forensic science cases, you will probably already know many of the stories."
2,"Good, but Slightly Disappointing","The book was somewhat well-written, and parts were certainly enjoyable, but there is nothing that you can find here that you cannot find in greater detail and with more useful information somewhere else. The case notes were frequently short enough that you would have no real interest in the case, and it read more like a How-To book for someone interested in writing a medico-legal thriller, as long as the person writing that just wanted a lot of really general information without actually knowing enough of what they are talking about. If you really want a good general interest forensics book, check out What The Corpse Revealed by Hugh Miller. In short, the book had a lot of information in it, but none of it was unavailable or more useful here than other sources."
5,classic collection,absolutely love this cd of recordings.Its Muddy raw and young.I recommend this to anyone that likes Mississippi Delta blues.
3,historical interest but not much more,"Willie Dixon as a songwriter and arranger was near-genius. Willie Dixon, as a performer, had problems, not the least of which was his lackadaisical voice. This recording is interesting in a historical sense, but nearly all of the songs here were done better by other artists in the Chess stable.It may seem hard to say that about Dixon, but wishful thinking will not make these recordings more important or interesting than they really are. A few cuts on here are flat out novelty songs and could have languished in the vaults, or been issued on compilations sandwiched in between much better songs (as on the Willie Dixon box set).Overall, proof once more that Dixon's talent was in songwriting and arranging, but not as a frontman."
4,"Against my better judgement, I love this book","First, let me establish that I am a pro-gun control liberal -- who just happens to like guns. I bought this book when I starting feeling the irresistable urge to buy a single action revolver. I felt that I needed to read up on the subject, and look at some nice pictures of sixguns.Boy, did this book pay off -- in spades. It looks like a coffee table book, has pretty pictures like a coffee table book, but -- jeez, this guy knows a lot about sixguns!The only problem with this book is that, in my opinion, it should have been organized differently. This is the first book I've ever felt I wanted to type into my computer and edit for my own use.My point is that this book has something to offer, even if you are not a ""true sixgunner"". (As I said, I'm a left-wing, pro-gun control city boy, and I want to customize my six-shooter -- even before I've bought one!)"
5,Buy this every year,Been ordering one per year to keep my razor functioning well as the battery runs out of its life. I highly recommend
3,replacement heads,"the product was not in the original packaging as in the image. It was in a clear unmarked plastic package. When i pointed this out, a replacement was cheerfully delivered, but alas in the same condition. Was never sure this was factory original, but seemed to work fine."
3,lots to learn from,"This book has a lot of information on the connections between spirituality and religion and how some go hand in hand and some are separated from the culture. But very interesting and helpful for a better understanding that in this nursing profession, the mind has to be open and no judgment and be willing to teach and educate both the patient and the nurse as well."
4,ok,was expecting a brand new book because that's what i thought i purchased but it was definitely used. still in great condition though.
1,Garbage!,"Let me first say that we have 3 Emerson Research clocks and we love them. I have had 2 stop working, but purchased new ones. I wanted another, but I can't find them in the stores, now I know why. This clock should be on the correct date and time when plugged in. It wasn't, in fact it was almost 3 months off. The default time zone should be on Eastern, it wasn't. So I tried to change it to the correct time zone, it wouldn't let me. I couldn't change the month or the date. It wouldn't do anything. I am in the process of returning this."
4,Alarm clock,"This unit is so simple its amazing, the very SECOND you plug it in the wall BOOM its done! It sets itself & nothing else left to do ... only ONE LITTLE PROBLEM ... it's not ready for the NEW daylight savings time schedule, so you must do that part manually. Otherwise, best alarm clock I ever owned!"
1,If it could ony keep the time.,"We bought 4 of these, since it seemed like such a good idea . everytime the power goes out, it resets atuomaticall. the only problem is that it keeps terrible time . all of them. we have had them 3 months and they are all 12 minutes off."
1,Died in 1 day!!,"Got this clock for Christmas.....It looked really nice.And it worked for all of 24 hours!! It then died, and has not come back to life. Stay away from this product."
2,Not reliable,"Got this clock as a christmas gift. Worked great for 2 months. But it does have problems:1) I agree w/ other reviewers about the LED brightness. Even in the dim mode it will light up the room. Drives my wife crazy. (If my refrigerator can auto adjust its nightlight brightness, why cant this?)2) The time setting isn't reliable. It recently auto adjusted its time exactly 2hrs ahead. This skipped past my morning alarm. Inexcusable for an ALARM clock and a serious software bug. All of the other atomic clocks in the house work fine. Im going to have to unplug the antenna to make sure this never happens again.3) The alarm off buttons are TINY. My wife can't ever find hers in the dark. I need to glue a larger button on top of it.Good try, but a weak implementation and not really worth the money.SMD"
2,Doesn't work with new Daylight Saving Time dates,"I have owned this clock since 2001, and it has worked great. The best feature was being able to plug it in and have the date and time automatically set. Power outages no longer cleared the date/time, and it used to adjust properly for Daylight Saving Time. I say used to, because when Congress changed the dates in 2006, the clock no longer resets properly. In the Fall, it adjusts a week ahead of schedule, and vice versa in the Spring. So my ""automatically adjusting clock"" is not ""mostly automatically adjusting"" - twice a year you need to manually set the time. As this was the biggest selling point to me, the clock is now essentially worthless. Avoid this product and find a clock that truly sets itself using radio waves, not internally hard-coded dates."
2,Don't buy this if you want to use the AM tuner!,"This thing is a hunk of junk. The AM tuner is atrocious, and I don't think that you can set the time to anything but what is coming out of your wall socket. I wish that I could link to an example of the AM radio that I made--it gets worse reception than a $5 earpiece radio the size of my thumb. It gets two stars because it does tell the time, and you can use it for an alarm."
1,Garbage,"I bought this clock at Target last year, the numbers are sporatically lit now. It's nearly impossible to tell what time it is. Seems to be dying from first number (invisible now) to last (still lit). Total burn. First few months it was great, but the lighting issue makes this a waste."
1,Great idea but needs some refurbishing,"First of all, I must say that this is a great idea for a clock. It really is great how it sets itself the minute you plug it in. It's easy to read but put on the dimmer switch -it is way too bright. With that said, the actual product is made very poorly. We didn't have ours very long, about 3 months, before the buttons to set the alarm dropped down inside the clock and well, it's nonfunctional. Plus now, the time is off by about 20 minutes and it just isn't worth the kind of money they're asking. It's cheaper on QVC but they don't stand behind it either. It only has a 90 day warranty and believe me, you'll need it! I bought one for a gift, however, and it is holding up fine so maybe I got a lemon. Don't know because others have had the same problem as I have. I'm going to reorder it and try again, keeping my fingers crossed. But I'm also ordering an atomic clock to be sure."
1,Misleading Feature,"to say that this clock ""sets itself automatically"" is a bit misleading. that is, mine arrived with a big flyer warning that when daylight savings time changes (new law for 2006), it won't be able to automatically set itself. therefore, the flyer warns, it will be necessary to set time four times per year--the correct dst changes (twice), then the old dst changes (twice more).my best guess is that this thing has a factory set, built-in clock that automatically sets the digital readout when it's plugged in. it preys on folks who think they're buying a clock with a receiver for wwv time signals (which my parents, who gave this to me, thought the clock had)."
1,display malfunction,"After about 1 month the display numbers were unreadable due to portions of the digits being burnt out, like when a light bulb goes out. Once that happened, the unit became unusable to me. Also, even after the burn-outs, the display was way too bright to be on my nightstand. I went to a window tinting place and they gave me a scrap piece of dark tint which I put over the display and that made it just about right-easily readable, but not too bright."
2,"GOOD CLOCK, BUT THE RADIO IS A CLUCK","Well what else can I say other then the clock is great and the alarm is very dependable and I like the alarms settings as you can set it to sound on weekdays, weekends or all seven days a week. As for the radio, well that's another story, the engineer that designed the antenna (Built Inside The AC Cord) needs to see the poor job it's doing picking up radio stations, it'll pick up high powered radio station but only if they're local, as far as the distance radio stations......forget it. Overall the clock is great but the radio needs a regular antenna, not this so called new and improved engineer special class. Oh and last but not least. This clock radio only cost about $14.98 at Walmart based on years of 2004-2005, I just thought you should know that."
3,"Great, except too bright at night","I would have loved this clock if it hadn't been so bright that it casts shadows on the wall, even on 'dim'! The auto time worked like a charm, and the dual alarms and radio features were great. The green LED read out was nice and big, and the controls were easy to operate. If they ever make a not so bright (maybe with a red LED?) version, I will be the first to buy it. I had to turn the clock around at night, which makes a quick glance to see the time impossible, and the alarms are hard to operate backwards."
1,Unreliable,"I've tried two of these clocks, and both ended up being unreliable. The first clock worked fine for a few months; then one of the alarms stopped functioning (on the dual alarm function). I did like the clock overall, so I purchased another one, thinking perhaps this was a fluke. After just one use, the alarm on the second clock failed to go off. I'm very disappointed in this product."
2,Not Worth the Money!,"I really liked this clock when I first bought it, however, like some of the other users, the buttons for the alarm have now dropped into the clock, making them unfunctional. Recently, several of the other buttons have stopped working. I liked several features of this clock, but its not worth it to have to buy a new one every 2 years!"
1,Not impressed,I got this clock radio from QVC because of the automatic set feature. That part worked great but it would not keep accurate time. I could set it to the correct time on Monday and by Friday it would be off 30 minutes. Finally got tired of reseting it and it' now in a landfill somewhere.
4,"This thing is awesome, except for the green glow","I love the fact that this clock sets the time automatically, and even remembers your alarm settings when the power goes out, but the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the VERY bright display, i have never taken mine off the ""dim"" setting, you must need sunglasses to sleep with the ""normal"" setting. That said I still love this clock, I like the dual alarms and have just learned to sleep turned away from the clock.UPDATE: this clock is pretty much worthless now that the days for Daylight Savings Time changed. You have to change the time yourself on those days, which isn't that big a deal. The bigger issue is that the time still changes on the old DST days. Pain the rear end to keep up with, so this ended up in a garage sale."
5,Like a kid again!!!,"The Lost World is an escaping drama. It takes you back to being a kid again and enjoying it. The DVD is great. Alot of adventure on one disk. Fictional episodes full of action and a alot of prehistoric coolness. Veronica is a must in this wild jungle world and a good kick boxer also. If she can really kick like that. Yes, go girl. Margarite is a clever mysterious beauty also and all the men better say on their toes to stay ahead of all the adventures wherever they may go. Highly recommended DVD for those who love the fiction in us."
5,Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World,Excellent series for those who want a good time in the jungle with interesting characters and pretty decent special effects - especially for a TV series.Count on each episode to have a dinosaur and a good looking woman running around!
1,Be FOREWARNED,"Buyers beware: The versions of The Lost World on DVD are NOT the original pay-per-view versions that aired on DirecTV before they aired in syndication on WGN and local stations. The original DTV versions contained nudity and other extended content, while the scenes were obviously edited down or replaced for syndication. The DVD producers should have used the original episodes instead of the edited ones, in order to create more value for the DVDs. In fact, this point is never even mentioned on the box or packaging.There's nothing worse than a DVD of a TV series that does not include uncut episodes, and that goes for network TV DVDs too. I'd rather have had the choice of seeing TLW uncut than to be stuck with ONLY the syndicated versions that most people saw. There's a huge audience of people that never saw the show as it was originally intended, and the show is unlikely to ever be released again, and that's a shame."
2,Only region 1.....,"The Lost world is really popular here in Brazil, we all read Conan Doyle's book as kids for school and even though the show has almost nothing to do with it, it's still wonderful entertainment for all ages. I was really excited about beeing able to have it on DVD, but unfortunatelly it's not available to us anymore.(Since they changed it,Nov 14th)Why it was ""all regions"" and now it is ""region 1"" only ??? Well, I guess all I can do is wait for it to be released here ( if I'm that lucky)."
3,The Lost World - FINALLY FOUND!,"My boyfriend had been looking for this one for years and now, it's here!!! Excellent! Really enjoying the show from the beginning!"
5,Pleased With Purchase!,Product arrived in excellent condition and I have had no problems with it. I would buy again!
5,Anyone know the name of the music played during the credits?,"This is a wonderful soundtrack, but I don't see/hear the great rock and roll music played during the end credits. Does anyone know the title/artist?"
4,"Fabulous soundtrack by Harry Greeson-William, great composer","Excellent movie, made even better by extraordinary soundtrack by Harry Greeson-William.As a huge fan of Hans Zimmer and Rolf Kent, always have an ear out great composers,so delighted to be turned on to this amazing score."
4,Excellent,"I am probably one of the few people that bought the soundtrack before even seeing the movie. Just knowing that Harry Gregson-Williams made this original score, it has got to be good. It has a similar beat to 'Enemy of the State's theme. But it doesn't have that ""added"" Hans Zimmer build-up power theme in 'The Rock.' A few of the first 11 tracks had somewhat a 'Gladiator' sound (by Hans Zimmer) i.e. Progeny, Earth, and Sorrow tracks(but not the heavy battle and pride tracks). The lonely piano scores is an excellent side i have first heard from Gregson-Williams. There is a scattered selection techno-beat tracks that don't disappoint. If you are a fan of Hans Zimmer and his apprentices, this is a soundtrack worth getting.- One of the Bad Boys II TV trailer - Spy Game: track 4 - Red Shirt. Hey they used it. Awesome how the screenplay tied in with the composition."
5,Makes you want to be in the movie...,"Definitely an excellent soundtrack. I highly recommend watching the movie first, however. It puts all the music in such wonderful (and tightly cohesive) context.A lot of other reviews (on other sites) have criticized this soundtrack because it sounds disjointed. They haven't even watched the movie with the soundtrack - they don't know what they're missing.Definitely a 5/5 and must listen."
3,Does Obscure Equal Interesting?,"If you think not, then avoid this book at all costs. While there is much to like in Harcourt-Smith's wartime books, this one is a real snoozer."
4,Gave 'counter-culture' a professional sound/edge,"Take an utterly beautiful, soulful band like the Fifth Dimension and add a heavy, professionally-crafted theatrical sheen, and you've got Rotary Connection. One of my amazingly astute and lively college companions/girlfriends was heavily into theatre - and was wild about them. If you like listening to music that's reminiscent of 'Hair' and/or 'Jesus Christ Superstar', RC will be right up your alley - they're definitely a very artistic/dramatic/appealing element of the late 60's counter-cultural ethos.It's also notable that some of the instrumental breaks and harmonic underpinnings veer a bit in the direction of folks like Van Dyke Parks - quite an avant-garde touch, as it were, and quite flavorful, if that's were your tastes lie."
4,Best of the 60's,"This is one of the great 60's musical experiments that blossomed not suprisingly at the peak of the psychedelic era. I know very little about the group or the artists, but I do know it is one of the few albums I enjoy listening to now as much as I did almost 35 years ago when it was first released. Absolutely awesome orchestration with great overtures, powerful vocals, and superb harmonies. Best Tracks are covers for ""Soul Man"" and ""Like a Rollin' Stone"", (the latter is argueably the best Dylan cover ever, right after the Byrds' version of ""Mr. Tamborine Man""). I would like to know more about the group, where they came from and what happened to them, if anyone knows."
4,Fantastic tool,"Excellent sander! Tons of power, nice balance and feel, a total quality product all the way. I bought one that was listed as ""factory reconditioned"", but I can't tell that it wasn't brand new. This tool is obviously going to last the rest of my life and probably get passed down a couple of generations. Its that good.There is one minor discrepancy to the picture: The product photo shows a small section of pipe between the sander and the dust bag. On mine, the dust bag connects directly to the sander. No big deal, but they should update the product photo.I do wish this was available with a factory case. Add that, and this becomes a five-star review."
3,uneven weight,"Powerful, quieter than most, tracks perfect. CON- super heavy on the left side from the belt drive and motor. occasionally leaves a sand mark on project wider than the 3 inches."
3,THREE AND A HALF STARS,"THIS CD FEATURES MUSIC RECORDED ON THE CHICAGO BASED CHESS LABEL OF ARTISTS IN NEW ORLEANS IN THE EARLY 50'S. NOT A LOT OF WELL KNOWN STUFF HERE, I NEVER HEARD OF ANY OF THESE SONGS OUTSIDE OF CLARENCE FROGMAN HENRY'S ""AIN'T GOT A HOME"". MOSTLY UPBEAT R&B STUFF WITH A NEW ORLEANS FLAVOR, KIND OF LIKE EARLY FATS DOMINO AND OTHERS FROM THAT ERA. A LOT OF IT IS REALLY GOOD, BUT SOME OF THE SONGS ARE A BIT WEAK, SO I WILL GIVE THIS CD THREE AND A HALF STARS"
4,GOOD VIDEO,"I enjoyed watching this video, but it was a little pricey. If you wait long enough, it will replay on ""American Justice,"" the series, for free. Enough Said."
3,ok i guess,my hair is still dry and when i comg it with the conditioner hair still comes out. maybe i need to try it under heat for 30min. just didnt do must for my not so afro hair
2,golly miss hathaway i am a big star!,"well jethro did a little better on the beverly hillbillies and least he made us laugh. max plays a narrow minded sherrif in this movie, but it does show some of the small town mentalities of the 50s and 60s. still worth watching."
2,Not a stable software,There is something wrong with the software.My system is Pentium 4 w/Windows XP.I have to re-install the software each time I use.
5,Huge difference in the quality of life,This is a medication that was recommended for my aging terrier. This product has really helped his overall quality of life. For a 14 year old dog I can still see a strong difference in his energy level and this has stopped his problems with anemia. Great product!
4,Vet approved Marin,"I have had 2 vets recommend Marin for liver function in my cocker spanial. They explanned how it helps with keeping the liver production of bile in keeping it from being too thick. The product helped with the flow of bile but ultimatly his gall bladder needed to be removed. I have been told to continue Marin for the rest of his life (he is 11 now) so that the bile does not turn back into sludge and grit. So far after 8-months of use, he seems to be doing fine with only slightly elevated liver enzymes levels (130's and 150's now and before they were off the chart, in the 5000 and 8000 range instead of the normal lower 100's.)"
1,Application information incorrect.,"This is listed as fitting application for 2001 Toyota Camry 4cyl engine, but the plug is incorrect and does not fit on the car, requiring me to return it at my own cost."
3,"DVD release is THE worst I have seen, so-so movie","The film is a lot slower than I expected, i guess it was a made for tv movie or so it seemed, but overall its so-so (watch once only) however the DVD release was very bad, i havent seen the VHS version but the sound was choppy, the picture quality was the worst I have ever seen on DVD (with picture echoes) and teh sound cut at the important parts of the film...Shame on the studios for releasing such a DVD..."
5,The Impossible Spy,"This movies was well written and gave the viewer a glimpse into the desperation and lengths the Jewish people will take to protect their homeland. It will cause you to search your heart and ask, "" Why do other nations persecute the Jews so?""."
1,Very disappointing,"The Youtube clips that are on the product website for this release were very misleading. They showed the 80s culture...from Pac Man to big hair. However, the majority of this 90 minute documentary is dedicated to Ronald Reagan and IBM. There's a short intro about pop culture, music, etc...but that's it. The rest is seriously computers and politics. Not exactly what I care about when I think of the 80s. For those that want to watch Ronald Reagan give a State of the Union address in full, or learn about Chemical Codes and double helix DNA, then this is for you. That's not a joke."
3,"Not as good as the other 4 - still, I liked it","I actually bought (at first) the 1940 one(to see what my parents were like as young folks) -- then got the 50's one since I was a late 50's brat, then the 60's for my early teens and then the 70's for my high school days, and ended up with the 80's for my college daze. The narration, content and music were all impresive in how they were done and they stuck with issues relevant to the social development in a way - that was at NO time, boring. And I'm such a Retro Hound - that this was a real treat. The extra features are great and for over 4 hours of extras PLUS the long documentary ---for the price, there is just no way you can lose out on having these if you are a retro lover or, just curious. Now - I just wish they'd do a 1910 - 1920 - 1930 series, too."
3,Low quality binding.,"First at all, I have to say the quality of the binding is very low. To put it in other words, in its current state, if the book drops from my hands, it would be very tedious to me to put the pages it their right order. With respect to its writing, on one hand I like it because it is very concise, but in the other is somewhat difficult to digest. I prefer much more Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen et al.)."
1,One of the worst textbooks,"One has to read reviews of textbooks with a great deal of skepticism. The students reviewing it are often struggling with the material and shift at least some of the blame to the textbook. Another common complaint about this specific subject is the text does not cover enough topics. To me, neither of these apply here.The book truly is terrible in and of itself. The text does not flow, the examples are poorly written, and the whole is largely incomprehensible. This is neither a good reference nor a useful didactic text.I recommendAlgorithms[Johnsonbaugh & Schaefer; 2003] first, as it's a clear text and the pseudocode is quite readable. My second recommendation would beIntroduction to Algorithms[Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein; 2009].I had this text in graduate school. I have not looked at it again. Nearly 10 years, and this text stands out as the worst I've ever had."
2,"not too good,","Not the worst, but there are better algorithm books out thereie. algorithms by dasgupti"
1,A student use this book to learn algorithms,"I'm a student at department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University.We took the course ""Algorithms"",and used this book as a text book.After a semister learning, i never heard any good comments for this book.The most word given to this book is""This book can make easy to hard!""We'll never choose this book as a text book again."
4,Such an easy solution to dog breath,Just put a spoonful or two in your dog's water dish and your dog's breath will stop smelling like what it licks all day long. I was skeptical until I got some and LeRoy's stank mouth was gone 24 hours later.
3,OK but they could be better,The tray is nice in the tool chest. The casting and machine work at the box end is poor. The opening in some of the box ends is not machined in the center. They are shiny but could be made better. Not as bad as the metric stubby wrenches I bought the same time.
2,Missing a part,"Despite the product description, all I can buy is the foil screen and not the cutter blades. I can't get those anywhere, it seems, for this very good but very old electric shaver. The foil is very good and is an exact replacement part. But I would really have liked to get the cutter head as well.And now they are not available from Amazon any longer. Guess I'll have to deep-six this loyal old shaver when this last foil wears through. Sad to see it go."
4,Brings back old times!!!,"One of my favorites shows when I was growing up.It brought back alot of memories. ""Just the facts Mame""DVD's were what I thought..1/2 hour episodes..Good deal!!Joe Friday..Badge 714"
2,Published in ole Inglish --- Oh my God,"While this book might be interesting to the surveying expert I found it tiresome trying to translate Elizabethian English to modern text. I was hoping for some useful hands-on information you might find in old text but missing in the new stuff. This might be especially useful if you're working in a refinery and don't want to bother with permits to use electronic equipment; old optical methods are all there is then.I don't really care if George Washington used this book or not. Unless you are a history buff avoid this book.He'd be the first to admit it: be practical.If this review was helpful, please add your vote.Thanks."
1,warnings,"The author is supposedly a native teacher of Mohawk, but this set is bad because:1. Mohawk pronunciation is really simple and the tapes are expensive2. The book gives very few words, its basically a grammar, not a full one either3. Perhaps to justify the tapes the author creates a writing system which requires transcription (a real linguist would ship phonemic sounds)Better go directly to 1000 Words of Mohawk, that book has a grammar intro too"
1,Really bad,"Awful record. It's just not strong. The strength of muddy waters work is undermined and diluted by some really awful guitar work. It's just inappropriate. Blues with a feeling it ain't. It's like the guys with the guitars were at a different session. The guitar sounds totally unrelated to Muddy's vocal delivery, or the tension of the song. I don't even think its an album really. It's apparently a big influential record for the black keys. Sheesh! Really? I think they are much better than anything on this record.I love blues. I love psych rock. This is neither. It's like muddy waters in one room and a mad river record playing in the other room and you're in a room between going crazy."
5,Great Record out of HIstory!,"Well mastered CD version of historic Muddy Waters album. The original ""I Just Wanna Make Love To You"". Really a great collection!"
1,Garbage,The lead guitar work on this CD is so annoying I just can not listen to it. There is nothing worse than a guitar sound like this. It is like driving a rusty nail into my ear drums. Avoid this CD unless you like Electric dribble
4,Psychedelic Mud,"This Muddy Waters disc was released in 1968, which should tell you a lot about it. Marshall Chess wanted to create a concept album that would hit big with the hippy rockers, people listening to Hendrix and Cream and the like. And it was a big seller, but not critically acclaimed. In short, this disc is not Muddy Waters' finest. In fact, from what I can tell, he barely even plays guitar on this album. Pete Cosey plays some great funky wah-wah guitar. Most of the songs are classic Muddy tunes, and even a Rolling Stones cover thrown in for good measure. Muddy sings well, though it doesn't quite mesh ideally with the busy guitar. It's definitely geared more toward the rock crowd; by no means is it a pure blues album. But for those of you into Jimi, Cream, Zeppelin and the like who also dig blues music and rockin' blues, this is a fun disc to pick up and listen to. Just don't let it be the definitive Muddy Waters cd in your collection."
2,I Don't Get It. This Sure Ain't The Muddy I Know & Love,"Just a lot of fuzz-tone and reverb...over-done, over-produced...over rated."
1,In Muddy's Own Words,"From the new Muddy Waters biography, CAN'T BE SATISFIED, I quote from Muddy himself (page 207, second paragraph): ""That Electric Mud record I did, that one was dogs--t. But when it first came out, it started selling like wild, and then they started sending them back. They said, 'This can't be Muddy Waters with all this s--t going on--all this wow-wow and fuzztone.""I agree."
2,Psychedelic Debris,"Muddy is always great but this CD is a little sad. I bought it when it first came out and it was disappionting then. I think it an attempt to cash in on white performers sucess with ""electric"" versions of classic blues tunes. The fuzz-tone guitars are just out of place with Muddy's robust blues voice. It has some historical value given the unique nature of the collaboration but other than that forget it. For the real thing get ""Mississippi Muddy Waters"" a great live album with Pinetop Perkins and Johnny Winter. It's 100 proof."
1,A Crime Against Humanity!!,"The reviewers below must be joking. This is an abomination - probably the worst album I've ever heard. I'm not a purist, just a lover of good music - and even Muddy recognised that this was awful. Much maligned? It really can't be maligned enough. By any standard this is truly dreadul - an attempt by an ill-informed record label to make Muddy Waters more accessible to white audiences. How? Who knows. Do yourself a favour, if you're after ""Electric Mud"", go for either ""Hard Again"" or ""I'm Ready"" (both produced by Johnny Winters). Poisoned chalk and an epicurist's cheese!"
3,good,"This is a blues purist's nightmare. SOmeone decided in the late 1960s to make Muddy Waters psychadelic, and the result was ELectric Mud.This is Chicago Blues with phase shifting, wha whas, any effect you can throw in--done and done badly, like zooming the camara in and out fast to simulate an acid freak out. This is like hearing 60s electronics with 50s know how.But for sampling, novalty appeal, or just plain love of 60s wierdness, you probably want to get this.WARNING: If just getting into the great Muddy Waters, DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, START WITH THIS.Hard AgainorAt Newportare no lose bets."
5,Watch out- this is not Keane the new Band from England!!,I just wanted to put a warning on this listing because these guys have the same name as the band Keane that has a hit single on the charts for 2005- this is not them!!! Read carefully and you will see. The real Keane album is called Hopes and Fears and it totally rules! Listen to the samples of that one and buy it!!! aloha
1,Wrong Fan,"The product was fine, but it was the wrong fan.Amazon.com handled it Great. They sent me a new fan still wrong.This site even asked again for make, model, etc. The returning of both Fans could not be better. I will buy everything I can From Amazon.com because thier customer service was the BEST"
2,"The ""over rated"" guy is right","I don't get it, there is nothing special about the IM project. None of the albums did I think were anything more than redundant psy. Nothing really stands out and nothing is There are some neat sounds but its not really catchy and it pales in comparison to Man with No Name(MWNN), Juno Reactor (old), and Astral Projection (AP). I don't recommend any IM stuff. Get AP or MWNN and you won't miss IM ever."
5,Best Album Ever In All Music Genres !!,Infected Mushroom Are And Will Still Be The Best Group In The Universe ! Infected Roxz !
3,1 movie worth the whole package,"While it may seem wasteful to buy this package for one movie, it was the only way to get a DVD copy of ""The Werewolf"" starring Steven Rich.The others were pretty awful, although we got some laughs out of the one (The Giant Claw) with the flying buzzard...LOL.The Werewolf was one of my all-time favorite monster films, combining better than usual acting with a well thought out plot, a script that was actually pretty realistic considering the subject, and some fantastic makeup for the time period when it was made...much better than Lon Chaney Jr.'s werewolf look.In short, if you want one of the best werewolf films for your collection then buy this set, otherwise, don't waste your money."
4,Couldn't be happier,"Would really have enjoyed some audio commentaries, but a great set for the price-- and the movies, well, they just... wow. Giant Claw rules, by the way. I don't care what anybody says."
3,3 stars,Picture was good but stories were fair... not to bad for the price though...... over all good buy. wanted the movie for my collection.
2,Vert slow read,"Ok so there was a lot of hype about this movie coming put about a boy a boat and a tiger. I prefer to read the book from which movies are lately being made from before I actually see the movie. However I think this movie might just be better than the book. Way too many chapters about nothing. A slow read. Very boring to tell you the truth. I kept waiting for something, anything, to happen."
4,"""Life of Pi""",I really liked the book and most of the ideas presented. I could have done w/out the more graphic description of the killing/death of the animals.
5,Amazing Journey,"This quite possibly the best book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Without giving anything away, the story has so much heart, so much soul, and is so rich in detail that it is easy to immerse yourself and empathize with Pi's plight.It is an amazing story laced with mythical and fablelike qualities that one read may not do it justice. I especially enjoyed the section in which Pi makes a ""botanical discovery."" This particular portion is written so descriptively you feel as though you are sitting with Pi in his lush surroundings.This book stays with you. I finished reading it in May. Now it is August and I am still thinking about it writing a review. As soon as I am finished with my current book, I am going to reread it.Enjoy it, pass it on, and share the experience"
2,Pretentious and Manipulative,"Before anyone sends me nasty comments, I will preface by saying I do not dislike this book because I ""missed the point."" The author makes it patently impossible to miss his point by laboriously repeating it over and over for hundreds of pages. I applaud Martel for attempting something bigger than the usual drivel that is published and delving into symbol and allegory, but his attempt seemed heavy-handed to me. From the beginning author's note with its red-herring promise of a story to ""make you believe in God"" to its warm-fuzzy insistence that all religion is story and all story is metaphor to its flights of absurdist fantasy I felt I was being manipulated by a fake story to get me to some kind of ""point."" And, lo and behold, when I got to the end, I found I was right. Apparently, many people find this book not just good but great; however, I am firmly in the minority that felt this was more a clunky attempt at sleight-of-hand than a gripping novel."
4,=3.14156,"The Life of Pi is somewhere between an adventure tale and an allegory. Pi sets out with his family on a boat, which wrecks. His father's zoo animals ride the lifeboat with him for almost a year, sort of.Yann Martel, a non-Desi, did a good job examining the vagraties of life in India and as an Indian, but not perfect. His take on the language in the prologue is amusing but incompletely correct. I felt that some of Pi's reactions were more Western than those of a young boy raised in Pondicherry, Madras, India.All in all, this is a good book and enjoyable. It should not be read as a glimpse into Indian culture but as an enjoyable fable.Minna"
