5,"Great way to build a jazz vocabulary, esp in/outside approaches to solos","I 've been looking for some serious jazz material for sometime... this is it! You can hear the sounds you love and hear how to play them, then you can even figure out the theory behind it so you can use similar passages in your improvs... this book is seriously educational and practical..."
5,Wolf Marshall is doing it again! Now in Jazz,"I have always admired the skills of Wolf Marshall in all his educating career, magazine articles, books...etc.; especially in the eightees when rock guitar was booming. But I never thought of Wolf as a real Jazz Author, so recently I purchased both 'Best of Jazz' and another on Wes Montogomery and to be honest I was skeptical that he would deliver!I was 100% wrong and the books were fantastic and Wolf did it again! The quality of subscription, playing and production is super stuff. A must for any serious guitarist who passed the journey of Rock shredding, and now in the phase of playing classic jazz (Maybe getting a bit older as well!!)Both books are highly recommended and I would grade them more than 5 stars, if that was availableFinally, Wolf if you write down any other books regarding Jazz, reserve me a copy."
3,"book ok, cd terrible","The transcriptions in this book are ok I guess (alltough you'll learn even more by trancribing yourself). The comments are not so 'in-depth' but pretty interesting.The audio-cd however is not good. The comping is ok but Wolf Marshall's playing is very bad. He has terrible timing. And since good timing is probably the single most important element in playing jazz it sounds pretty awful. If you want to learn these solos, get the original recordings and listen to them carefully (and maybe use the backing track for practice).I was very dissapointed with the level of playing on the cd..."
5,The careers bible,"This book is a bible for those who want to boost a career. Life is too short to learn from all mistakes. So this books helps you do prevent mistakes and leads to insight how to use the best office politics without losing your self-respect.It's full of clear real-life situations to make office-politics-rules understandable. I should have had this book when a started my career after the University. It would have saved me time, being fired and frustration.Iv'e recommended this book to all my brothers and my best-friend."
5,A Key Resource on Mastering Office Politics,"This book is one of two key resources I recommend to my clients, in my capacity as a professional motivational speaker. The other is:The Secret Handshake: Mastering the Politics of the Business Inner Circleby Kathleen Kelly Phd ReardonAs a set these two books cover the fundamentals of mastering corporate and office politics, With Dr Reardon's Book covering the Big Picture and Dr DuBrin's covering the details.As a set these two books, will put you securely on the road to Political Mastery.In Everything Truth, Faith and LoveDestin"
5,Saddle Club DVD,My daughter loves to watch the Saddle Club DVD's and so she put this one on her list for Christmas. She just loves it.
4,"The Hot Flash Club, a novel","This is an easy read, and if you are 50 years or older, you would love this book. The friend of the Hot Flash Club are all different types of females,from a scientist to a local massage woman. There are other books from the author, and you will enjoy all of it!"
2,Moves very slowly,"Reading this book now...Usually enjoy her books, but this one moves too slowly and is not keeping my attention. Don't find myself waiting for free time to pick it up again."
2,Just not her best work,"I've really enjoyed the author's other work, but this is pretty terrible. The characters all have unforgivable flaws, like lying and adultery, with no remorse for any of it. I read the whole thing only because I was hoping it would some how get better at the end. No luck there, I am afraid. Read her other works, skip the hot flash books."
4,FIFTY IS HOT!,"""The Hot Flash Club"" should be mandatory reading for every woman over 50! If one doesn't feel good about themselves before reading this little gem, they will love themselves afterwards.Contrary to popular belief---mature women are vital, sexual, and outrageously, deliciously dynamic! Nancy Thayer creates memorable characters whom the reader will identfy with, laugh with, cry with, and love. Several story lines are woven in ""THFC"" like a colorful, unexpected quilt--quick, witty dialouge, fun, fun, fun!Nothing is over, baby. Even if a few things are drooping, wrinkled, and not the same as when you were 20 years old---they are still very much alive, lovely and lush.You are still a tigress--only at 50--you are more wise and wonderful!"
3,cute book-except for the ending,"This book was cute, and very entertaining. I enjoyed reading it and laughed aloud at some parts of this book. I think the biggest problem with this book was the ending. It ended too soon. I believe it needed another chapter where they tell what each character is up to 5 years later. We need to find out how everything turned out for them! What also was sort of unbelievable was how these women became ""fast"" friends. I still think it's a fun read, just think the story could have been improved upon."
3,Ok read,"I was prepared to like this book from the title alone and it did cover many of the aspects of the ""going over"" from your 40ties to your 50ties. I especially liked the accurate description of how invisible you become. The growing friendship of these very diverse women was nice to watch unfold but, bland nice is how I would describe this book. There were for me major problems with how some significant issues were glossed over the first one that comes to mind is infidelity. The message seemed to be if it felt right and you are basically a nice person well, instead of parental or friends indignation you got a milder reaction. I still don't understand Alan's vehement reaction to his mother's complicity (again rather mildly) letting Jennifer meet part of the family she was so keen on destroying. Jersey girl reaction this isn't nor is it particularly power to the sisterhood either. I probably won't seek out another in the series unless someone drops it on my desk as a trade read."
4,easy read,I have read all the books in this series. It's very well written. entertaining easy to follow. I enjoyed!!
3,Easy Read,It was okay. A little long in some parts. The characters needed more depth. Not sure if I will read the next book.
2,Insipid Book...,"Any book with a character (Shirley) who repeatedly says ""jeez louise"" needs some serious editing. This book in no way compares to Thayer's earlier books. I agree with the reviewer who wrote that the writing was dumbed down to suit a wider audience."
5,Boy can I Relate!,"I read this book in two days and was sorry to see it end. I now eagerly await the chance to read the second book. Nancy Thayer has written a gem and it should be given to every woman going through that time of life. In reading this book I realize that I am not alone in my feelings about my body, my emotions and all the rest. It made me laugh, cry and THINK. Romance, feeling good about yourself and pursuing dreams do not have to die when you hit 50. That age can give you more freedom than you have ever had and this book celebrates all of that and more. For once someone has written a book about something other than sleek young things and all I can say ""It's about time!"" Nancy... you go girl!"
2,All you wanted to know about menopause but were afraid toask,"I am not near the ""hot flash"" stage of life, but I thought this looked like it would be a good/funny book. It was a quick read, but it seemed a bit silly & contrived to me. I laughed out loud a few times but only because it was so predictable. The story moved quickly, though, and it is a good beach escape. It just lacks depth. And by reading this book, you WILL read all about everything that happens in the hot flash stage of life ... and I mean everything!"
5,Absolutely delightful!,"This is the first book I've read by Nancy Thayer (and, certainly, will not be the last). Besides the great and humorous writing, I probably liked the fact that she's the only author I remember reading, lately, who uses correct grammar. Being the general age of the four members of The Hot Flash Club, I could relate to many of their concerns, but I really believe that someone in her 20's could enjoy the book just as much. The women really have very little in common but when they decide that each will take on another member's problem, it gives them a bond.I had a hard time putting the book down and kept relating the story to my husband as I read."
3,"morality play -- shallow, some drama, very light reading","Four women almost all over 60 get together and try to solve each other's personal, family, and work problems. Good for raising awareness of what women may really struggle with: men, and attractiveness to them, always matters -- no matter what age or social position. (The cover photo unwittingly makes that clear -- even to get you to take the book off the shelf, they couldn't put a realistic picture -- those are not 60-year-old legs!) The detective-story-like drama does make you want to find out what happens. And I liked the Boston/Cambridge setting -- a familiar location is always fun. But the characters are two-dimensional, and the stories tie up too quickly and neatly. If you want a modern morality play that friendship and faithfulness do still matter, fine. But for real character and plot development, while addressing women's experience, I'd say look elsewhere."
4,Fun,You'll laugh with these ladies. You can also relate on some levelif you're over 50. It's light and fun. You'll laugh and cheerthem on.
2,don't say I didn't warn you,"I don't know what movie the other reviewers watched, but this was a horrible movie. A waste of $1.99- ""I could've had a V8""."
1,Seriously,It was awful. You now have stolen some of my life and I want it back. I will haunt you after death.
1,is there a negative stars option?,"The only way anyone would give this movie a positive rating is if they stand to benefit financially from it or they are so brain dead they themselves might as well be zombies.Move along, nothing of any value to see here."
4,the american plague the terrifying story of the yellow fever epidemic of 1793,"this book was kind of ok to me i rated it a 4 because it wasn't the best book I've read it could be better . It was kind of intresting when I found out how they got the name and who studied the disease and found some what of a cure and how many people died from this dreadful illness , I felt kind of sad because, I know that some of those people were my ancestors and they died because of this illness that they took many years to find a cure to it.thanks fo listening or reading my review.ttyl"
3,Reliving the Yellow Fever,"An American Plague was definitely an informative book about the Yellow Fever and how it affected the city of Philadelphia. The details of the content in the novel is evidence that the author, Jim Murphy, did his research on the topic of the yellow fever. I like that Murphy also included first hand testimonies from the time period such as newspaper clippings that gives readers a meaningful experience.This book was really easy to get into and once I started, I wanted to read and learn more and more!I usually like to watch the history channel as well as read books that are centered around a historical event, so this book was right up my alley. Even for those who don't enjoy history, I think that this book would be entertaining to a variety of audiences.As an aspiring teacher, I would use this book to combine literature and various social studies lessons in my classroom. I think this book is a great book that combines a story with accurate researched information."
2,This Book is painfully boring!!!!!!!!!!!,"An American Plague is about the yellow fever epidemic of 1749 in Philadelphia. The only thing I did like about this book is it goes into very specific detail about everything from the era, the culture, and how they treated the disease and those who had it. The following is a quote from the book with alot of detail "" In Philadelphia an increasing number of cats were dropping everyday, attracting, one Philadelphian complained an amazing number of flies and other insects.Mosquitoes wereevery where, though their high-pitched whirring was particularly load near rain barrels, gutters, and open sewers"".In this book I learned that people didn't always have cures for diseases right away.When this did happen people would flee.If I was the author of this book I would make the story about one person and the city around them instead of just about the city. I think the format the author wrote it in made the book very dull and not fun to read."
3,This book is alright,"From what I've read of the book, An American Plague by Jim Murphy I think this book is okay. I thought that all the pictures in the story were unnecessary. But I liked the information it gave, in most stories the author won't show every theory from scientists. If you are really interested in the yellow fever it is recommended that you buy this book."
2,An American Plague,"The book is about the 1793 Philadelphia outbreak of yellow fever. What I like about how this book is written is that it is detailed and accurate. It also includes clues as to how the disease came to Philly and from where. I am going to put a few passages from the book in: ""The swamps and marshes had already lost a great deal of water due to the intense heat, while the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers had receeded to reveal long stretches of their muddy, root choked banks."" Here is another qoute from the book: ""Mosquitoes were everywhere though their loud pitched whirring was mostly near rain barrels, gutters, and open sewers."" I learned that they have a slow way of dealing with those types of things. If this was my book I would have less talking about things that don't really matter much in the book. I rated this book a two because it is really boring and there is no action or anything. I just think it could have more interesting parts somewhere in the book."
5,A non-fiction book that reads like good fiction,"This is the story of the Yellow Fever epidemic of 1793 that decimated Philadelphia. Most folks don't know much about this plague; I didn't til I had to research it for a class I'm taking (for a class I would teach).This book, written for young adults, is captivating. The illustrations are relevant and extremely interesting; the text flows and is full of foreshadowing and detail that are the hallmarks of good writing. It's short enough to finish in a timely manner, and has all sorts of ""excerpt"" quality passages that one could read to students.Although it would be best placed as a resource book in a classroom, I found it entirely readable as a book on its own. Though I got it for a class, it will stay on my shelf as a favorite. That's a rare accomplishment for non-fiction, in my world!(*)>"
4,Great album of an unforgetable deep bluesman!!!,"Many of the great bluesmen weren't recognized.In spite of this fact they've left a great treasure of good moments and Sleepy John Estes was one of them.This album shows Este's way to play and sing with intensity heart feelings,his great songs with soulful lyrics almost all of them of his own composition.We must thanks the opportunity that Bob Koester gave to bluesfans to hear and know something more about this legendary bluesman,died December 1,1977,at 77.Rest in peace John Estes,you've passed by....so your music, will be eternal!!!"
3,only 2 audio tracks plus video,there aren't 4 tracks on this single despite what the summary states.1 - point of view point (edit)2 - point of view point (yann tomita mix)3 - data track with point of view point quicktime video
4,Handy,"I just wanted a small bag that my daughter could store her Gameboy, games, and power cord in an organized way and with a large shoulder strap so that she could carry it bandolier style. This fits the bill rather well and is durable. Imagine my severe irritation when I found it on the clearance rack at our local videogame shop for $1.50 and minus the rape of the crazy shipping cost. Grrr!"
5,A+,Such a great wagon at a great price. Cheaper than others but just as strong and good looking. We always get compliments on it. It worked great pulling the baby and his stuff to the beach through he sand.
4,John Deere wagon,"This wagon is well constructed. It is just the right size to pull my grandchildren in. The side boards needed a coat of Polyeurothane and the tires needed some air, other than that, it was good to go... I did increase the turning radius."
2,Nice but thought it would be a little more durable.,It is a nice basic wagon....gets the job done...but we were hoping for something a little more sturdy. We use it to pull the kids in but if you turn too quickly it is possible to tip over.
4,Nice wagon,Our son likes being pulled around in this wagon. The quality is good for the money. The only negative is the turning radius.
3,"Just a good product, could be a better value.","The John Deere Wagon is a good product, but priced too high for the quality. The sheet metal it is made of is relatively thin gauged. It flexes a great deal when exposed to the slightest stress. The welds appear to be of high quality, but the sheet metal around the welds flexes a great deal. The wooden rails are unfinished wood. This seems unacceptable for a product that will be used outside and may be left in the weather. During assembly my greatest concern was of getting grease or soil on the unfinished wood as any stains will likely remain permanent. The list on this item is $129.00. While this vendor sold it for only $89.00, I was disappointed in the quality of an item bearing the John Deere and Ertl logos. I expect higher quality and better value from these companies."
5,2 in 1,"We wanted a durable wagon for our toddler and this fits the bill. We also use it to haul yard waste, plant materials and whatnot around. So far its held up well. Cost much less than what we could get the Radio Flyer for and its the only one on the block. One of the review questions was to rate its 'educational value'. I dont know if its made her any smarter, but she does enjoy it."
3,John Deere Wagon Review,"I had good luck with the shipping. Initially, the ship date was scheduled for up to a month after I placed the order. I was happy when I received it after just a brief wait.However, when I was putting the wagon together, I noticed that one of the sides had been ""dented"". If this were a gift, I would have immediately returned it. However, I had the whole wagon just about put together (I did it by myself which is really time consuming) when I discovered the dent. Because I am using it as a puppy carrier, I did not return it. However, I would highly recommend that all buyers thoroughly check the product before putting it together."
4,Great Wagon,"GOOD:When compared to other new wagon's this wagon is very well made. It is all metal.The tires are better quality than any other new wagon I could find. They have steel wheels and rubber tires.Bad:One thing I wish the description would have been more clear on is the wooden sides are not easily removal. To remove them, there are 10 screws that have to be removed.The handle does not fold completely under the wagon. I cannot fit the wagon into the trunk of my car without removing the sides and handle.The wagon does not turn very sharp. It's fine for making a big turn but for a sharp corner I left to front off the ground."
2,Unstable - CHEAP- Made in China -,"I thought a John Deere Wagon was the Best. This wagon is CHEAP - Raw unknown wood stakes - unsafe - My hands do not fit in the wagons pull. The pull only fits 3 fingers. The worst is that this wagon does not turn freely. It only has a 3"" lead side to side. So you always have to pick up the front end of the wagon to move it. I am thinking that since this is made in China that tells me that the paint is LEAD.John Deere sucks!"
5,THIS BOOK,"You know what I'm looking for. If you find it, please email atpineapple35205@yahoo.comAny help will be greatly appreciated. MONEY IS NO OBJECT (as long as it doesn't exceed the national debt)."
5,This book was one of my faverit books!,I got this book a long time ago. But I let someone read it. I never got it back. I was hopeing to find it agen. I didn't get to read two of the storys. In it. If you find it love it as much as I did. I was hopping Del James would have put out more books. He is very good.
5,In the same boat as everyone else it seems....,"If anyone happens to have a copy, I would really appreciate them letting me know how much they want for it. One great book. Go figure living outside of one of the biggest cities in the US and I'm still having problems finding this book!"
5,Excellent Collection of Short Stories,"I purchased this book in February 1995, shortly after it's release. Like so many others, I was interested in this novel because of the Don't Cry and November Rain videos, and wanted to know the rest of the story. I was not let down.James has the unique ability of portraying reality and realism in a grasping way for his readers. The ""horror"" of his stories are not found in blood and gore, but in the fact that the tales he weaves are real; they can and do happen almost daily. He is a very observant person and displays his observations keenly. His discriptions are at once catching, something that is very difficult for even the most talented of writers. There are no boring scenes found here!There is a reason why this collection is so well sought after now. Not because it's a brief interlude in GNR history, but because James has a real aptitude as an author. I am troubled that he has never published anything else. Hopefully, someday he will!"
5,I found it!,"After looking for this book for 3 years, I have finally found a copy of it but have not read it yet. Just about every review online that I have seen consists of people wondering where they can find this book. If you're looking for this book, I'm betting you're a Guns n' Roses fan, looking for clues to the November Rain video. You did not find this by chance, and whether or not the short stories in it receive good or bad reviews here, you will continue to search for this book. A bookstore in Chicago that specializes in new and used sci-fi, fantasy, and horror books had at least one copy for me. The bookstore's name is ""The Stars Our Destination."" Good Luck!"
2,Not As Good As Hoped,"Bought this for my son in college as he had heard about it and was anxious to read it especially since Axl Rose recommends it. My son is an avid reader, but it's taking him some time to muddle through this one. He says it is not as well written as expected. I can tell he was disappointed in it and he says he's had enough of Del James for awhile!"
5,Not a Step-By-Step Book,"This is not a how-to book and Tom Dorrance said up front that it was not. This is the next step in the journey and I can see how it would be a disappointment for those that are looking for the equine version of mapquest to get where Tom's going to go.He does repeat himself several times, but based on several of the reviews for apparently obvious reasons. The senses are unique to each person based on their backgrounds and their beliefs. The feel between myself and my horse and how we get there is not going to be the same journey as my friend and her horse.This book was designed for the person who is ready to take their equine relationship to the next level."
2,Tom Dorrance can not explain his theory and practise.,"This book is a disappointment. Tom Dorrance keeps searching for words to explain what seems to be his metaphysical relationship with horses and comes up short. Then, students who have studied with Tom give their version of the Dorrance philosophy and training methods. Midway through, I laid the book down in exasperation. I wanted to help Tom with words as his struggle is so apparent. A truly unique pioneer, a humble man but not a good book."
4,"Good book, informative.","I liked this book and loved the way it was written. It was very clear and definitely a good read for any horse lover, western or english!"
2,A Disappointment,"Mr. Dorrance could not describe his relationship with horses, just that it was a ""feel"" thing. I think I made it through 2 chapters before I said ""forget it"". I don't know how he could teach other riders what he means if he couldn't even write down what he means. Very frustrating to read (what I did read)."
4,True Unity hard to read but worth it,"I liked this book because Dorrance tries to explain how a horse thinks. This is not an easy task and he gives lots of examples of this. Horses think in pictures. It all comes down to that. If we can see them doing what we want consistently, then it can happen. It's all about understanding the horse. Not an easy book to read but worth taking the time to try and understand what a true horseman is telling us."
2,YUCK!!,EEWWWW I HATE TAMAGACHIS THEY ARE STUPID!!!!!! THEY POOP SOOOO MUCH AND IT SMELLS HORRIBLE!!! I JUST WANNA TOOT ON THEIR HEAD!! YUCK TAMAGACHIS ARE DUMB!!! DONT BUY THEM
2,Content exellent but quality of filming very poor,"The most interesting thing is the author explaining his own work. As I am unable to go to America and meet Neale Donal Walsh himself. I found it interesting to be able to watch him explain his books. The contents of which is not only thought provoking , but hopefully will help change the way we relate to each other and how we view what ""GOD"" means to each of us,no matter what name we choose to call him by. Even if you are not religious, I feel that these DVD's together with his books will become a journey of self discovery which would benefit even the strongest atheist.My only criticism is the poor quality of the filming and sound in places which made me feel at one point that this must have been filmed by amateurs, but other than that, I would highly recommend it."
3,Not that impressed.,"It does the job, but I am really not that impressed, it was priced O.K. I had a little trouble getting it to come on the first time, had to push the on button really hard and it mad a loud snap that sounded like something broke inside, but other than that it seems to work fine, it is no better or worse than any of the other LCD monitors that I have seen. LCD is cool because it saves space, and doesn't hurt your eyes like a tube will, but I am really not that impressed with this monitor."
4,how to pay,I lived in Viet Nam. I want to buy it but i don't have account. May i give you the money after you bring it to me. if not you can tell me the other way to cash for it.
2,Cheap looking,"It's a very cheap looking lamp - the brass finish looks very fake. It isn't flexible - all you can do is tilt the lamp top a little bit. It works OK, but I would not have ordered it had I actually seen it first. I didn't want to go to the trouble of taking it apart and packaging it up to return to the vendor, so I just put it in a corner. It was not a good value."
5,easy and fast,For me the first time I ordered trough Amazon.comItem was send just a few hours after ordering and arrived overseas in just a couple of days. Super!!! Only negative thing is that you can not pay trough pay-pall so you have to give your creditcardnumber over the internet.
2,Good to look at but leave it in the store.,I did enjoy seeing the cute pics.. however the this book is rather out dated with info. It is filled with family info but not good for a mom to be or a mom in the first few years. It does have a few funny answers to the questions that moms of multiples seem to get a lot! It was fun to look at and read for the enjoyment of it..
3,Good if you like pictures....,This book didn't provide much useful information on how to survive the daily life with twins. It's focus is mainly the emotional health of the family-- which *is* important. But I was wanting a book that would help me deal with the trivial things we take for granted before having twins. It is a nicely laid out book-- I loved the pictures. But the information *I* wanted just wasn't there.
2,an inadequate reference for pre-delivery,"Fortunately, someone loaned me the book and I didn't have to buy it myself. I'm only nine weeks pregnant with twins, as a result of fertility treatment, and for my questions, the book is basically useless. There are approximately five pages dealing with pre-delivery issues, and those pages are mostly dedicated to the question of who has multiples and why. I'm sure it will be a decent resouce seven months from now, but I need a source that tells me what I should do today. If you're fewer than eight months pregnant with multiples, I wouldn't recommend this book at all. I wish I had a good recommendation for you, but I'm still looking myself. The Elizabeth Noble book, which someone also thankfully loaned to me, has a very little bit more about the pregnancy with multiples, but it's not much better."
4,Fun book to read,A friend gave me this book and told me to read it. Pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Fun to read. Bought a copy to give as a gift.
4,Great Purchase,I bought this for my husband. He is very happy with it and would definitely recommend it. I did not give it 5 stars because he is not able to shave the tips of his ears like his previous shaver.........none the less it shaves great.
3,"good, but a bit dated","This is the first and only edition of this book, which, while it explains all the theory behind retrosynthesis quite well, is a bit lacking in some of the techniques that have (I presume) been discovered since it was published some 25 years ago. It's mostly there, but just make sure you consult some different sources for specific things, like 1,4 relationships (there's no mention of 1,3-dithianes at all in this book). All in all though, a thorough and reasonably accessible treatment of the topic."
4,"Excellent, definitive","An amazing and incisive description of retrosynthetic techniques, written at the advanced undergraduate level.My criticisms would be:(1) Rather too terse at some points; a few more words would make it flow more smoothly;(2) As the book progresses, there are increasing references to ""Strategy and Control"", and more annoyingly, the workbook; the text is not entirely self contained, and I should not have to purchase the workbook for simple clarification;(3) The index is really poor. This is the book's principal failing, and makes hunting around for cross references much harder than it should be.Nevertheless, this is a wonderful work on an exciting and important area of organic chemistry, and I heartily recommend it."
4,CLEAR!,Absolutly fantastic! It's clear and useful for those students who want learn more about total synthesis! ! ! ! 1
1,Poor Quality Tool,"I purchased this product to cut a seven year old 2 1/2"" tailpipe. It was unable to cut the tailpipe and the tool actually failed before a single successful cut. The tool is poorly designed and one of the arms collapsed as the tool was tightened around the pipe. I can not recommen this tool. It may work better with a 2"" tailpipe or smaller. The tool is too fragile to be considered a serious automotive speacialty tool. Lisle makes great products, but this is not one of them."
5,Great Tool,"I finally got around to using this exhaust pipe cutter,it worked very well.Be sure to use lubricant on the pipe, tighten the handle 1/4 turn for every revolution.It took me about two minutes to cut a 2"" exhaust pipe. Take your time.The tool is sturdy enough for occasional use."
4,exhaust cutt off tool,I worked great for the first cut but did not do so good for the second and third. I was cutting stainelsss and it was twice as think as the oem that came out of he vehicle. I would recomend it for 2.25in and below diameter. Cutting wheels did not look like they could be repalced either.
2,"ok tool, but flimsey...get what you pay for","Got this to replace my broken chain type exhaust cutter. This tool is very flimsey. You really have to take your time to make sure your cuts will be lined up even while your cutting & if your not careful you can easily make the pipe out of round. On the positive it gets the job done and its less tedious then using a handsaw, but the same if not better results can be had with a cutoff wheel. If you want a nice clean cut I strongly suggest paying the extra for a decent chain type exhaust cutter. This was on an aluminized steel piping, I seriously doubt it would cut through any kind of stainless steel. What can I say, you get what you pay for"
4,Did the job,"I used this tool to make three cuts in 2-inch stainless piping. The tool worked as advertised and did the trick. My only complaint is that it is difficult to get a perfectly square cut. Meaning, I ended up with a slight ""spiral"" cut. You can get a really clean cut when you are cutting pipe off the car as you can check all sides of the pipe to make sure the wheels are all lined up in the same groove. But if you're under the car and working in limited space, it may not be so easy to get the tool square with the pipe to get an absolutely clean cut."
4,Easiest Tool I've Ever Used!,This tool is the easiest hand tool I've ever used. It makes quicker and cleaner cuts than a hacksaw and works great in tight spaces.
2,"Good Academic History, Boring Story Telling","I was a little hard for me to read this book.Altough the author makes a very good book in terms of a scholar work, the work lacks life and vigor.Probably the Punic Wars is not an easy sell to readers but still, the author could have done a better job in presenting a more colorful and living history.I am not saying that he should turn the Punic Wars into an Indiana Jones movie, but the book is too scholarly,too Oxford, which makes for a pretty boring book.I found myself reading a couple of pages and then putting down the book for another time.It took me almost 5 months to finish it.If you are looking for a college course, this is your book.If you want living history get another book"
3,False Advertising!,"We had recieved a Diaper Genie I from my sister-in-law when we had our son. This product advertises a picture of the ""Stage 2"" diaper genie refills...which they're not. Apparently there is only one type of refill now for the Genie I. They need to change the picture!! I was hoping to find something that worked better, that smelled less...but I recieved the same refills that I buy in the store - that don't specify any stage or anything. Totally disappointed. Genie I is an okay product. We place one of the refrigerator Arm & Hammer boxes in the bottom of the Genie to help with the smell and it works out okay. (We change the Genie 1-2x a week)."
1,Painful time i will never get back!!!,"Why oh why do they keep making this type of movies???. Seriously, you will have a better time staring at a rock. This movie is just plain dull and stupid. I do have to say it would have been better if it was a book..."
4,Guerrilla Cinema,"Primer is an experiment. Attempt to judge it in any other context and you have failed to see the point.What Aaron and Abe create in the movie is fascinating because it is capable of doing the impossible. The very same principle is what makes Primer such a remarkable piece of work.Making a truly thought-provoking film with a budget of $7,000 and a running time of 78 minutes just does not happen in Hollywood.And while Primer is ultimately a small step rather than a giant leap for independent filmmaking, it is encouraging to see even the most obscure of ideas find a home (or at least a garage) on the silver screen.[from the trailer]What is truly wanted?To repair it all."
5,Excellent film... For the patient.,"If you're a fan of ""messy"" time-travel flicks, this is the movie for you.That said, at least two viewings may be required before you understand what's going on in the last hour.Also a great example of compelling sci-fi filmmaking on a low budget."
2,"2 Stars Watching, 5 Stars Making","I like puzzles, time travel, science, and intellegent movies. I watched the complete DVD. I liked the realistic camera work. I'm sure all the cast and crew had fun and learned a lot making this film, too bad they didn't get an experienced editor and writer - it could have been a very good movie.If you love to watch movies multiple times and puzzle over every nuance in an attempt to grasp the unknowable, this is the perfect move for you. I just don't want to spend more time in the PRIMER time loop to crack a so called ""code"" that's a result of inexperience in story telling.I'm glad I just rented it. I recommend it with 5 stars as a training film for all first time movie makers."
3,Original but it could have been better!,"This movie suffers from lame soundtrack, less than optimal audio during some dialogue and very dry and sterile overall rendition of the concept. I really like the idea of the chaotic time travel paradoxes it portrait, but it does so in an unecessary and overwhelming confusing way. The soundtrack does not build up the moment at any point during the movie and the dialogue did not need to be so technical. I still find this movie captivating in a strange way, I just wished that it was a little more polished. Overall: DECENT!"
3,subpar,"I didn't care for this movie, it's slow and confusing and the acting is subpar.I like independent movies but I don't understand the big hype around this one.I tried listening to the directors commentary to get some insight but just left feeling frustratedI want my .99 cent rental fee back."
3,To understand movie requires time travel with rewind button,"The movie is a big practical joke that nobody really gets. In order to understand the movie's plot you need to go back in time, multiple times. Ironically (or not), this is also what the characters do in the movie. Maybe the whole puropose is to play with viewers' minds and get them to watch it over and over again.It's like a 3-D onomatopoeia..."
2,Confusing.,I was interested in some time travel movies so a friend recommended this in addition to Back to the Future and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. This one was the most confusing and boring out of the three. I persevered and watched the entire thing even though I was tempted to turn it off. I thought the telephone booth in Bill and Ted's was a dumb vehicle for time travel but the boxes in this were a little less imaginative than that even. On the whole I think time travel movies are hard to follow with people coming in and out of the past future and seeing duplicates of themselves. This movie added a whole other level to that kind of confusion. It was recommended I watch it again but I think I may just move on.
5,Amazing!,"This movie is the best and most consistent time travel movie i have ever seen. Stupid people tend to not like it because they cannot understand the complexities of time paradoxes, but for engineers and other intelligent types, this is the movie of the century!"
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad!",Worst film ever do not rent or buy this film. cheap production and bad acting. DO NOT watch even for free.
3,"Great idea, good story","Interesting film, the story was a bit confusing, but really good idea, overall I liked it. may have to watch a few more times to full get it"
2,"Very little action, hard to follow","I'm a time travel aficionado and a fairly intelligent man. Time travel movies and scenarios are not new to me. Having said that, I'd have to watch this movie numerous times to figure it out completely. There is almost no action so it is not ""fun"" to rewatch. I'd recommend going to Wikipedia after watching and reading their synopsis plus viewing the time travel diagram they have posted. This helps a lot!"
1,"Sorry, not good","This was a boring piece of crap. Unlike some other SF movies like Buckaroo Banzai and Starship Troopers which don't make complete sense but challenge you into trying make sense out of them, this one was deliberately, pretentiously obfuscatory but in no way made it enticing to attempt to find out the details. At the end all we felt was relief that it was over and no desire to understand everything that happened."
1,Still awake.,"I found the deepest moment in this film to be in the following line: ""Should we be wearing googles?"" I think googles would be fine followed by a long nap."
1,Worst time travel movie ever made,"This boring movie is totally drek. A complete waste of time. It is FAR worse than the time travel movie in one of those Mystery Science Theater 3000 sets.The extremely low budget of this movie is very apparent throughout. The film makes little sense, the acting is terrible, the wardrobe consists of the 2 dullard stars wearing the same shirt and tie throughout, no matter what the occasion.Almost the first half hour is a bunch of dull guys talking dull stuff in a kitchen!!! And the movie hardly improves from this!This movie won a prize? I can't believe it. Did people actually pay to see this in a theater?I would say to the movie's maker: Don't quit your day job!"
1,"Not worth it's total production budget..$7,000","Arguably one of the top five worst Sci Fi films ever made. It's even worse than John Carpenters 1974 bomb, ""Dark Star!"" In a nutshell..disjointed plot, rapid unending (often unintelligible) dialogue, impovished visual landscape (takes place in a garage), musical score (what's that)?This film does have one virtue however. If you have trouble falling asleep, you'll definitely want to buy it!"
4,"Good,although confusing, film",This is a film you need to see more than once to piece together information.If you start watching this film dont be scared away by the techno babble just sit back and comprehend what you can.The real shocker is that it looks so good for such a low budget.It is a real good story and it deserves the praise it is getting.Give this film a try and flex your brain muscles.
1,"Good try, but didn't do it for me","I do respect what they are trying to do in this movie, but it doesn't come to fruition in my opinion. It is definitely true that you will have to watch it at least twice to get it all, but I am not sure you will want to after the first viewing....I didn't. This is a movie that had great potential, but in my opinion it never reached it. You may disagree.I don't mind depth and intricacy in a movie plot, or even a little misdirection in order to keep it exciting (e.g. Sixth Sense), but I do mind confusion. And it was not just confusing, in the end, despite a nice attempt and maybe a few moments of drama, to me it was just plain boring. Alot of my boredom may just be attributable to the minimalist approach to this whole movie, nevertheless, it bored me. It relied to heavily on the story and the acting, neither of which were bad, but not nearly good enough to make up for the lack of visual interest in this movie."
1,77 minutes I'll never get back,I love time travel stories/movies but this was awful. My friend and I sat through this and didn't understand it. Then we read the wikipedia page and we still barely understood it. Too esoteric.
5,Awesome movie!,I loved this movie. I also learned a lot about filmmaking by watching the movie. I think it's a must for anyone that is interested in making movies. Great writing. Give Shane a bigger budget and let's see what he can do!!!!
2,Hunh?,"I'm a smart guy. I like complex, even vague, plots. I'm a SF nut. I think they just lost it somewhere in there. Watched it twice."
2,101 syfi,Sorry I had to pay for this rental. watching and listening to the characters was very frustrating. actually gave me a headache. felt like my thoughts of what was acting was in a blender on puree. yes that bad.
3,"quirky, but?","This was an interesting and quirky film, but I don't know that the premise is particularly plausible, no matter how much reality I suspend. I don't mind the time-travel bit, but the plot holes that are never addressed effectively. Some things just happen and there is no logical (despite what I think was intended as an explanation) connection between some plot elements. You'll probably be shaking your head, and thinking a second viewing is needed to better understand it, and that's fine, but it wasn't engaging enough for me to warrant that second viewing."
5,A modern masterpeice. A legend already.,"Primer is a brilliant film. It is a true sci-fi film. After seeing it I was changed. This movie reknewed my faultering belief that there are people more intellegent than me in the world! There are, and they have made a ultra-low budget sci-fi movie."
3,The key to the movie,I think being a computer systems engineer and programmer is a real plus [requirement?] to undertanding the movie. The key phrase in the movie for me is when Aaron says the problem is recursive.IBM definition of recursive: see recursiveor: A process which contains a step within itself which causes the process to re-invoke itself.refer to Goedel Escher and Bach chapter on pushcorn and popcorn.
3,This was a surprisingly decent movie but really fell flat in parts.,Better than I expected but fell flat of the potential. The main problem is the story has many plot holes that are never filled and the acting is wooden and it was hard to feel or relate to the characters. not bad but had a lot of potential that fell flat for me.
5,Mindbending,"Wow, what can I say. Definitely a movie my girlfriend and I will be watching over and over. Very gripping, tense, and complex. Still trying to figure out some of it. I can't wait to watch it again, this time with the commentary track."
5,Causes and Effects...,"Two men crack the secret of time travel, only to have their discovery hopelessly complicate their lives. PRIMER is the best, low budget brain-blaster I've seen since IDAHO TRANSFER! Although things start off innocuously enough, there is an atmosphere of unknown dread hanging over the entire film, increasing in density as events grow more uncontrollable. Definitely worth multiple viewings, PRIMER scratches that itchy cerebrum..."
3,"Good concept, but confusing and poorly acted.",Not a bad indy release. They could have explained things better.
1,"Boring, tedious & confusing.","No doubt this film will have it's die hard followers, but I think the average viewer will find it boring, tedious and confusing. I had to make a real effort to watch it the whole way through and felt utterly unrewarded."
1,Geeky dialog could not have been worse!,"Hated it! When I have to turn on subtitles for an American film to have the slightest idea of what is going on, then something's wrong in my book. This talky, nowhere film may have an appeal to some, but I vehemently hated it. Sundance Award or no Sundance Award, ""Primer"" would have never won in my book."
1,Pseudo-intellectual Excrement,"This movie does prove a point. Two geniuses having a brilliant discussion on theoretical physics can be made into a boring film. Time travel has always fascinated me. This film does not. It is, in fact, the worst movie I have seen. Smart topic, dumb movie."
5,Brilliant insight into 3D Graphics and Animation,"Reading this book gives one an awareness of the many aspects of 3D. It awakens the senses of observation such as lighting, textures and motion. The effects are very intuitive and well chosen. The book does require prior knowledge of Studio Max and is aimed at the 3D artist wanting to take the software a little further. As a lecturer in Multimedia it is a must-buy for my students when it comes to 3D effects."
3,"Lots of pretty pictures, poor tutorials","This book isn't much more than a picutre book, showing what 3D Studio MAX R3 is capable of. The tutorials are poorly put together, and some of them are missing steps which for some users might not be able to complete them. Not a book I recommend buying."
1,problems with the tutorials,"The only reason i would'nt recommend this book is because i have done 3 tutorials and BARELY finished one. The instructions are either missing steps (the blackbird) or the steps are in the wrong order (the disintegrating ball). Most of the other students at the college that i go to that have used this book have agreed with me. That is unfortunate because of the really cool content of the book and tutorials. So, unless you're an excellent problem solver, or an experienced Max user i'd have to reccomend leaving this book on the shelf for now."
2,Money badly spent,"I specifically targeted this book because of the disintegrate material effect but was unable to follow it cos of missing parts in the tutorials/scenes. upon trying to work it out my self , I still havent I will have to put this book in the toilet as emergency toilet paper. I was really dissappointed when I sent emails to coriolis to try and get the proper tut file scenes (2 years ago) and still havent recieved any feedback, this is so frustrating. I'll never buy another coriolis text again."
2,all eyes and no ears,"This recording sounds like it was done with all walls and surfaces covered with carpet and using only one microphone which is also trying to pick up percussion being played in the next room. The only thing coming thru is a bunch of midrange and oddly the high ""tsst"" of the lead vocals. Horrible mastering and/or recording. I purchased this because of the very dynamic performance captured on John D's Echoes radio show and am now regretting the lost dough. Looks like I'll have my cassette deck on standby to capture the re-broadcast of that moment and will box this CD up for used grabs."
4,Love it!,"These ladies have some fantastic talent! I love their fresh, folksy sound, and these sisters harmonize so well together. So fun!"
5,Great record,Wonderful record by a really innovative and original sounding band. No guitars on the record at all. Looking forward to the next one!
5,Excellent new young group!,"I have also seen these ""sisters"" several times live. First was at Lilith Fair in Denver and I had, at that time, never heard of them. Well that sure changed. They stole the show and were amazing. I've seen them a few times since and they contiue to grow as songwriters and musicians, although they are already very talented in the musician sense.I thought to myself, after the first time I heard them, if they're not the next big thing, (or at least make it big), there has to be a problem.My highest recommendation!!!"
1,Kindle edition is not the Signet,"A search for the wonderful Signet edition of Shakespeare's works turns up a ""Kindle edition"".It is not the Signet class with its criticism and notes. In fact, the lines are not numbered. Difficulty to use for teaching. Not what I think I was led to believe it was -- a Signet classic."
1,"Junk, may be okay for point and shoots but too flimsy for a DSLR","Great idea, but I bought one of these and was highly disappointed with it, it's cheaply made in China. It will probably work well enough with a lightweight point and shoot camera, but a DSLR is way too heavy for this mount. The small ball tightening screw cannot be tightened enough to hold a DSLR steady. Save yourself both time and aggravation and buy a solidly built rugged unit like ones from Manfrotto or Bogan. They may cost a lot more, but they're worth every penny of it."
5,A Great Little Charger,"This charger is better than the one that came with my 5yo son's Arctic Cat Powerwheel. It charges the battery very quickly, and has indicator lights to tell us when the battery has enough juice to use, and when it is fully charged and ready to unplug. We had lost the original charger and a duplicate would have cost a small fortune. These are not cheap, but they are cheaper than the one I lost and work quite a bit better."
2,Worked once,Bought this charger to keep the Power Wheels running and it worked great one time. I went to use it again and it was still red after 4 hrs. I hope it didnt ruin the battery. I guess I will go back to the original charger. What a rip-off!!!!!!!
3,Quick Charger,"We have used this charger several times and it does work, however the charge does not last as long as it does when you use the original charger for 14 hours."
4,Decent,"A little pricey in my opinion, but still cheaper than the store, but works great and charges our little kids truck battery."
5,Power Wheels Jeep 12v Battery & Charger,"VERY fast delivery. The battery and charger for the kids Power Wheels Jeep is ... a battery. Works great, but expensive (regardless where you buy it)."
4,Replacement Power Wheel's 12V charger for Fisher Price 4-Wheeler,This made my grandson smile because now he can ride the 4-wheeler that his neighbor gave him. His mom is greatly relieved!!
5,"Charger works, diagnostics simple","I like this charger as it gets the power wheels battery charged fast and easy. The diagnostic lights are a bit simple, but can be easily misread or even mis-diagnosed. If you get a flashing red, the charger will still give a charge. The solid red, of course, means that it is charging a good battery. Sometimes, even new batteries can get a bad battery signal. But, just keep charging with the flashing red. It will turn green eventually. You can use a meter to verify this if unsure on both battery and charger. You should get something like 14 volts for a fully charged battery. This is how I figured I needed a new charger since I got the power wheels second-handedly. The charger shuts down when the indicator is green to protect the battery from overcharging. The important thing is to not let lead-acid batteries lose too much charge where the chemical process is irreversible. So keep the power wheels batteries charged before storing for long periods."
1,Bad charger,"Ordered this from amazon a couple of weeks ago. It worked a whole five minutes. After that the indicator light wouldn't come on. Waste of 40 bucks! I had to go out to Walmart and buy a brand new one. That one seems to be working fine so far. Hopefully it doesn't quit on us, or else we will be out 80 bucks in powerwheels chargers."
5,don't buy here,the item didn't work. wouldn't charge the battery for my grandsons' favorite toy. i only bought the charger for this company.
3,Very Helpful,"We were doing a program on the stain glass windows in the Alabama Presbyterian Church, in Choudrant, Louisiana. There was no information in the church to tell us the meaning of the symbols. Many of them were found here. The information was most helpful. The book was in good shape."
2,Not for frequent use,"I want to love this blanket SO badly, but I just can't. This throw is triple layer which means that the first layer is orange, the second is white, and the top layer is navy. So when you're only looking at the front of the throw, it's great. But turn it around and it is bright, bright, orange. I machine washed this (on gentle) after receiving it and noticed some stray pieces of yarn in the dryer. Didn't think much of it until, after barely using it on our couch for two weeks, I have started noticing threads pulling out from all over the thing. I mean, you can seriously grab a thread from one end, give it a little tug, and the whole thing will come out. I am so disappointed as this was a gift for my husband and I feel like it could have been so much better. I feel like it is too delicate to be used regularly. I recommend looking at the fleece throws instead. I would buy one in a heartbeat if I could get my money back from this one."
3,MEANT FOR TLC BUT THEY TURNED JA DOWN,if you're tired of ja rule singing look elsewhere but if you like his sentimental side with a little bit of mary j blige go 4 it.
3,its ok it shrank,it shrunk on me im only 5'9 180 and i bought a xxl and it shrank somethin does add up
4,David Elliott was great,Pretty good flick. David Elliott saved it from being boring. He elevated the story and made it much better than a stock horror movie.
3,Will Palm stay ahead?,"My previous Palm served me faithfully for 6 years, so I upgraded to the Zire 71 as the best value Palm PDA. The design is superb, the display brilliant, it has/can add everything you want save perhaps a microphone. However, the PalmOS is not as reliable or sensible as before. Several times in the last month it has reset, removing all data and applications, resetting the clock, etc., ie, when plugging in an SDIO card or removing a PalmOS5-incompatible application. Grafitti2 makes some excellent usability changes, but loses some sensible things unnecessarily (eg, U-backwards is no longer V---why?!?) and cannot allow ""old-style"" T, even though third-party add-ons can... how superficial is that? It also has silly bugs (capital letters in password lock desktop!) and the support people (phone AND email) appear helpful but are woefully ignorant. I despise Microsoft, but I will look carefully at a Pocket-PC PDA next time, Palm may have dropped the ball with OS5."
1,Lasted only one week,"Unit went totally dead after only the first week of use. All data gone. Now I'm stuck having to do it all over again, but this time, I'm shopping for another brand of PDA."
1,Very Unhappy!,"In early January I had purchased the Palm Zire 71. As soon as I brought it home the darn thing broke. So I returned it for the same model. Again, when I brought it home it broke. The problem was that on the screen nothing would register as I would touch it. On both PDA's the same problem occured. I had it with Palm! So I purchased a Sony Clie and I love it!!"
2,trading it in,"I recently received a Palm Zire 71 for Father's Day...I thought it was an unexpected great gift...I am dissatisfied. The software that comes with the Zire seems to work without a hitch...just try to load ""compatible"" software...nothing but crashes. I estimate that only 25% of the software I have tried to load works....software companies are not yet ready for the Zire...I could wait 6 months for them to work out glitches, but I don't have the time"
2,cannot install on an athlon motherboard,"my system has an amd athlon motherboard with via kt133 chipset. or so I am told. The palm absolutely refuses to load on my system. It works great with my husband's system, a P4 with a slightly different via chipset. This does me absolutely no good. We have upgraded the bios, the usb drivers, and received absolutely no help from PALM. I think this is their problem, and they should fix it. We had one long telephone conversation and then no follow up on their part."
5,Palm Zire 71--best yet!,"Okay, so......I wanted a zire 21 at first, then I also wanted a digital camera......I couldn't afford both, but then I found this little puppy. The camera is great! Better even than regular ones because the viewer is much larger. I also got an expansion card, and was able to put my CD collection onto it and listen to it whenever. The graffiti 2 system works well, and I am pleased with all of its regular features. I also downloaded audible, and can now listen to audiobooks. I also like eBooks, but I prefer the smell of regular paper. But having games on is a problem......the game cards are overpriced. But realArcade had free demos of games that expire after 10 uses. But you can just keep downloading the demos instead of paying 10 bucks for the game....Definitely worth it, this zire is great for those people who would like a 72, but can't afford it..."
5,Bad Luck To Some!,"I think that for the features you get with the Zire 71 it is an excellent product. Camera, PDA, MP-3, audio books, games, books etc.(...) The Zire 71 is light-years ahead of my old 130.The only drawback are problems with RealPlayer Plus and downloading music. Their security codes tend to make the system crash alot.As far as the negative comments- I have no problem with XP, syncing or any other problems associated with the negative reviews.If you are looking for a PDA with more bang for your buck you can't beat the Zire 71."
2,Don't Give Up Your Paper Calendar,Buyer please beware: Palm Pilots crash repeatedly for no apparent reason. I bought one last year with the hopes of retiring my paper calendar. But I had so many crashes and I spent so much time performing the 'hot sync' function that it was not cost effective to use an electronic calendar. I don't think that I had a defective unit because I've heard similar tales from other Palm customers.
1,No voice memo - big bummer !,They put so many things into this small piece and didn't include so important tool as an organizer - VOICE MEMO !What a big bummer ! I consider it as a pinnacle ofa idiosynchrocy and stupidity.
1,Defective product,"My new Zire 71 has had a problem with the battery since I purchased it - it loses charge rapidly and unexpectedly and causes all data to be lost. In calling Palm support to get it repaired I was told there is a huge backlog for this repair. It seems to be a very prevalent problem so be aware that if you buy the Zire 71, and need it repaired (which sounds like it is likely to happen), it's going to take awhile."
3,good PDA,"I bought 2 palm zire 71 for me and my boyfriend, we think that they have everything that we need. While the camera is not perfect, it's good enough for quick snapshots...If you want a good camera...buy a digital one.The only drawback is that the material is very slick and i am worried of accidentally dropping it....but it's a wonderful device, well worth what I paid for it.I am writing this review again after I had to repair my PDA...the problem was that I had to send the palm 3 times because the palm support gave me a damage palm for 3 times... the 4th one is fine."
2,Operating system can not be upgraded,"At first glance the Zire appears to be a Godsend. Fast Processor, Beautiful screen, hidden camera, however Palm again made a mistake by not offering this unit with a flash Rom. PALM is steadily behind. There are normally tradeoffs with features from model to model, but this issue causes concern for me. PALM is regularly releasing hardware that is not ready for the consumer market such as the Zire 71, Tungsten C, (Lack of stereo headphone out or mic and clicking problem. I am just not impressed anymore and decided to finally go with a Dell Axim 5 and completely move away from PALM OS."
1,It stops working just after the warranty is over,"After one year and two months of little and careful use, my Zire 71 stop recognizing any touch on the screen. I researched in the internet and discovered that a lot of people who bought a Zire 71 around the same date have the same problem as I do. PalmOne just said that I would have to pay 1/3 of the purchase value if I wanted to get it fixed.So, do not buy anything from a company which does not respect your rights as a customer. This is obviously a project flaw or a defect in production batch, but they do not admit it. Ethics? I do not think they know this word..."
2,Kinda disappointed,"This is a bit pricey but I was intrigued by the slick little camera and tired of the size, weight and poor battery life of my Dell Axim, so I got one. As another reviewer pointed out, the camera is just a toy. I was hoping to at least be able to take the occasional throwaway snapshot to e-mail to someone, but it's unacceptable even for that. Routine PDA functions like calendaring, contacts, desktop synchronization and such are fine, and the screen is good. Don't know what I'll replace it with, but it will probably be sooner rather than later and I've only had it a couple of months. Too expensive for what you get."
1,Doesn't Hot Sync with Windows XP,"The handheld is great, but after 6 weeks, it suddenly stopped Hot Sync-ing with my computer. Many hours and 3 days later on the phone with Palm Support and I've been told ""sometimes this happens with Windows XP"". I'm still at it, currently downloading all sorts of updates to Windows and Drivers for the USB Port (my computer is about 14 months old). I've been told to ""take it back"" if it doesn't work, but all my data that I rely on is there in a form that can't be backed up or transferred. Despite the fun with the camera (I'd email a photo, but I can't upload those either!) the Palm is essentially worthless. Even if I do get it to HotSync, it's been many hours on the phone with Tech Support and many more hours of aggrevation. How can Palm sell a product that can't work on XP? I've been a huge Palm Fan for years, but I may be back to pencil and paper from here."
4,Give Us the Old Razzle Dazzle,"I am enjoying the step up to the Zire 71 after my M505 was stolen. The speed, colors and camera are all a great improvements. It is a pretty, bright and shiny toy with lots of snazzy extras. The following comments reflect the down side of the upgrade:1) The power supply was not upgraded. So, whereas I could go a week between charging my 505, I have to charge this one daily.2) As noted by others, the above problem is exacerbated by the provided case actually turning the device on when you put it away. ( I have solved this with a soft universal case. The addition of velcro on the back for the case has helped me hold onto the slick little devil too.)3) I hope that more accessories are coming from Palm."
1,Now it Froze!,"I wrote a review below called ""Doesn't Hot Sync with XP"". I took the Zire 71 back to [local store] and they offered to give me a new one (actually I had to buy the new one to transfer the data, then return the first one after I cleaned out the data). I was happy with this, but now my second Zire 71 is 3 weeks old, and suddenly Froze, completely. I called Palm Support (they're all my familiar friends across the globe by now) and resetting in a variety of ways didn't work. I was told what to do (I should know in 5-6 hours if it works) but this entailed losing the data in the handheld and I hadn't Hot Sync'd in a few days. This time I bought a service contract, so I guess I'll just get a third new one since December, if this doesn't work. I generally have decent luck with these things, but I think my Zire 71 is jinxed. Stay Away."
2,Zire 71 Loses Data Regularly,"I agree with having had the repeated frustrating experience of having something in my purse hit the toggle, turn on the power, and then lose the charge in my battery. But what is worse is that I bought the Zire 71 to help me remember appointments and organize my addressess book, yet random items completely drop out of the memory. It is just awful! I tried downloading repair patches and they seemed to help a little, but there has been no cure. If this product is as leaky as my brain, then what good is it?"
1,"Great Palm for a year, then adios.....","When I first got my Zire71 two years ago, I loved it. The camera was neat and convenient, I was totally organized. Then, after about 18 months, all of the sudden the screen wouldn't recognize the stylus and acted like something was pressing in the middle. The only fix was to let the battery drain all of the way down, recharge, and sync. Then it would work for a week or two before going into convulsions again.I would definitely NOT recommend purchasing a Zire71. I am currently shopping for a new PDA -- camera, WI-FI, Bluetooth ?? Palm does offer the Zire72 - but with no WI-FI, I may be looking into a new Sony Cliè. Besides...... I'm not sure I want to keep on buying a new Palm every couple of years."
5,In regards to hot syncing with xp,"There was no problems hot syncing with my xp machine and palm does a great job updating their software. The camera can slow down quite a bit once software is added. The movie and mp3 support comes in handy, but does not have built applications I can recommend. The basic features are nice and the layout is very comfortable and functional. I recommend this handheld to anyone looking for a great deal. But if you want top of the line and the big price tag I would look else where."
3,terrible software and terrible support,"I am quite pleased with the handheld itself and have never had any major issues with it. The desktop softare, however, is downright terrible. I can't switch to a yearly or monthly calendar view without having it crash. I have reinstalled several times to no avail.I contacted tech support but they never seem to understand the problem, insisting I reinstall their software even though that is what I have already told them I've been doing. I filled out a survey telling them I was unhappy because they hadn't been able to solve my problems and never heard from them again.If a decent competitor arrives on scene with better software, and better tech support, palm will quickly be a thing of the past."
5,Sweet Product,"Palm gets PDA and mobile devices. While other manufactures tout the hardware specs (microprocessor spend, RAM amount, screen size, etc) of their products, Palm delivers what's important to most of us - functionality. The integrated camera is simply an engineering and ergonomic marvel, which tends to be mutually exclusive on most technology products. And the OS, having used both Palm and Pocket PC devices, is by far the easiest and most intuitive to use.Zire 71 is not prefect, and nothing is. But if you are looking for a PDA without wireless capabilities, Zire is the best there is today."
1,Eats power and freezes without warning,"This device eats through power like there is no tomorrow, and generally needs to be recharged every 2 - 3 days. Make sure you have a charging cable with you if you travel, otherwise you'll be stuck schlepping around the heavy and bulky hotsync cradle all the time.I've had the unit for about 6 months, and it has recently decided to freeze on. None of the buttons work, it will not shut off, and resetting the palm with a paper clip (both soft reset and hard reset) only makes it get stuck on the introductory flash screen. The only way to fix it is to let the rechargable battery drain completely, then reset the system.I'm off to buy a new handheld computer -- probably from a competitor of Palm. I've been using Palm products for several years, and am sorely disappointed with this one."
3,A Short Life...,"I purchased my Zire 71 in July. I have had several pda's... the Palm Professional (remember that one?), the Palm V, the Sony Clie, and most recently, the Zire. The resolution was great, nice functionality, etc. Unfortunately, 2 months shy of its 1st birthday, it locked up & died.... This is my second Palm product where the system has just locked up and stopped working. A very serious design flaw. Too bad...."
3,It has potential,"On paper this device is almost as good as the Sony Clie PEG-NX70V. The camera is a nice feature (though it is a low resolution), as well as having MP3 playback. There are some problems with transferring and playing back MP3 files (more than I discovered after visiting a chat room). Some people (myself included) seem to need to download an extention patch to read any files on the SD card. In my case it didn't help, and before I could even use my handheld, I had to send it in for repairs. At least customer service was good. However you have to pay the postage to return any device for repair, which I find poor. Transferring music from your files to the device is tiresome. There are a lot of steps involved, and it's time consuming. Overall, I think it's a great handheld for the money. If you're willing and able to pay more, go for the above Sony Clie. They are not as problematic. Perhaps Palm will iron out any problems they have with this PDA by next year."
2,"Good for 18 months, then went belly up.","The Zire 71 was a pretty good PDA for the first 18 months of its life. The camera was kind of a ""wow"" feature when I first got it, but the picture quality is poor. I haven't found much use for the camera, but overall the Zire 71 worked pretty well.The problem is that the touchscreen has gone haywire. It no longer responds appropriately or predictably to the stylus and the PDA has been rendered useless by this problem. Unfortunately it is not worth the $125 that palm charges for non-warranty repair."
1,disturbing to say the least,During #10 an older boy gropes a young girl's chest. Then the other boy does the same thing to the point that the girl has to move his hand away. I had to rewind it several times to make sure I wasn't seeing things!
5,Inspiring Patterns,I purchased this book because it contains a pattern I've seen on line. The book has pattern after pattern that I want to try. Lots of cables and color - and all sweaters/jackets that a person would actually wear - not crazy stuff. This is an excellent knitting book.
2,worth the rental cost just for the bad acting!,"This movie is hilarious. Pity that it isn't supposed to be. The acting-especially the police chief-is so terrible at times that it almost makes up for the rest of the ""plot"".Just a bad movie overall."
4,creepy movie with an awesome ending,"This is about a woman named Agnus who believes to be a reincarnation of Jack the Ripper's mistress, helping him commiting crimes. In the present day, Agnus thinks her pychiatrist is the reincarnation of Jack. The film making is very stylish and moody, especially the visuals of England in the 1800's (I thought they made this scenery better than From Hell). Without giving anymore away, I recomend this movie to anyone interested in Horror or Artistic films."
1,Sucks,"On a scale of 1-5, 5 being the highest, the thriller""Hell's Gate"" gets a solid ""SUCKS!"" Don't give it asecond thought. The acting is s-o-o-o-o bad, RodneyDangerfield would toss in his grave. A bomb...a totalnosedive into oblivion. This one should go straightto &^%$!!!.I'm not normally this blunt and cruel with a review, but trust me, you will echo my sentiments once (if) you watch this abomination!"
1,Hated the Movie,The product arrived safely and in relatively good shape. The content was what I had anticapated and the very reason it was ordered. I believe it can be assumed that I enjoy the DVD/CD(s). You probably have figured out that I strongly dislike being made to write these reviews. I can see reviewing a book or a product that is being tried for the first time.
2,Pretty dreadful!,"I looked forward to this film because of 2 factors.A:It's based on a book by Douglas Clegg,a fine horror writer.B:John Hough has directed some good horror movies.I can forgive a movie for being silly,but NOT boring!I haven't read the source novel but I'm sure it got butchered.Don't waste your time and money."
4,Terrific melodic metal album,"This album follows a familiar script for melodic metal. It steps in the footprints made by bands like Gamma Ray, Savatage, Allen/Lande and even Dream Theater. The music is decent, but not groundbreaking, which is why I give it 4 stars, not 5, even though I enjoy it greatly. The solos are great, the rhythm guitars are strong, and the drumming/bass is solid as a rock. The album is very well produced. However, the biggest reason I enjoy it so much is DC Cooper's vocals. He's one of the best (if not THE best) out there. His voice is just perfect for this style of music. If you're into melodic metal, I think you'd like this album a great deal."
4,Leatherworking kit,My son and I had a great time putting together the various items in the kit. Good instructions on all the items EXCEPT one (the wallet) which there were no instructions.
4,Fun with a Parent,"This is a great craft, but children under 13 need a little help and a lot of praise! Find one for $15 or less and you'll be pleased!"
4,Positive Experience,Quick delivery! Stamping set was for niece who really is pleased overall. Quality merchandise. Would order from vendor again. Thank you.
1,"Would be fine if the included parts were, well, included.","The materials that did come with the product were fine, though of eseentially no use since the whole point of this kit is to allow kids to decorate the leather with the metal design stamps. It says the stamps are included inside, and also says they are included on the manual. No stamps. Thus, kind of useless."
5,Ink Cartridge Review,The Brother Model IN710c Multicolor Ink Cartridge worked great in my word processor. It is a shame howver that I need only black ink for the items I half to print out and that this type of Ink Cartridge is so hard to find and is so expensive. It makes it hard for a budding authors to try and write their books if they can't get what the need to do so and for the reason that it is so expensive.
4,Caballé & How To Sing Opera...,"Unfortunately this DVD lasts quite 43 min. only. Picture and sound are not very focused and the top notes have some distorsions. But, what a rarity and what a gorgeous singing by Caballé in her golden years!!! Unbelievable perfect technique and breathing, bright top notes, beautiful pianos and pianissimos... I regret, but this is a dream for today's opera goers!!!"
4,Marv Albert video sports blunders!,"If you enjoyed Alberts ""Late Night"" spots, you'll love this tape! Starring a pre-disgrace Albert, co-starring his smirk and toupee, with appearances by a pre-disgrace O.J. Simpson, as well as Charles Barkley, Bob Costas, Chuck Daly, Mike Ditka, Mike Fratella, Ahmad Rashad, and many more. Great clips from a multitude of different sports. Too many goofy sketches with the co-stars, in my opinion, but the clips are priceless!"
4,A Nice Heavy Dose of Sarcasm,"This book, while a quick read, was quite enjoyable. Taking the opposite approach from the other books that tell you what to do to maintain a healthy loving relationship, Ben goes through all of the most common things that people do to ruin a relationship, or even to keep out of a relationship at all. Everybody should be able to relate to this book in some way. I know I've been guilty of some of these behaviors, and I've certainly been a victim of some of them, too. If you want to learn a little more about how good relationships work without getting bogged down by some tedious psycho-babble nonsense, Ben's book is a very entertaining way to go about it. He even manages to squeeze in a nice little plug for Jimmy Kimmel."
3,HAPPY CONSUMER,THIS IS MY FIRST PORTABLE CD PLAYER I LOVE IT THE REMOTE CONTROL WORKS WELL. I CAN OPERATE THE NON REMOTE FEATURES IN THE DARK AND THE UNIT SHUTS OFF IF NOT PLAYING ON A REPEATING MODE. THIS IS NICE TO GO TO SLEEP TO. THE UNIT DOES NOT SKIP ITS ALL AROUND GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY.
5,Great for intermediate/advanced C++ programers,"This book is great for intermediate/advanced C++ programmers. Very readable and informative. I'd recommend it even if your compiler of choice is not terribly standard compliant, i.e. Visual C++. You'll learn more about the standard and refresh your memory on some things about C++ you've forgotten."
5,The Best,"This book has a reference manual style. This is one of the best c++ books I've read, because, as I'm already a C++ programmer, I don't want all that bloat that comes with another non-manual books.It contains very good, direct and compacted explanatory material, covering a lot of internal details.I miss it so much for C++11."
4,A good book for C++ programmer,"ANSI/ISO C++ Professional Programmer's Handbook is a very good, quite excellent book for C++ programmer, who have been for an advanced C++ programmer, I think. The book describes almost all of aspects and features of C++, which are overlooked in general by people. At the same time, it is facile, easy to understand. In its content, it can compare beauty with Effective C++. Besides, it contains a chapter, C Language Compatibility Issues.And this chapter is splendid, too.All in all, it's a good book. But I wonder why it is NOT Recommended in ACCU.The unique regret is the name of the book. I think it should have a better and more appropriate name."
3,Cute but difficult to read the time..,"Bought this watch a while ago. Expected the immage to rotate which it did not. So it looks cute but it is difficult to read the time sometimes. Good use though, very solid."
3,"Entertaining, But Pretty Formulaic","I enjoyed reading this, but after finishing it, I couldn't help but feel like it was the book equivalent of an ""After School Special"".There were all the stock types--the tough on the outside but caring teacher, the best friend who gets into trouble, the brainy, not so flashy guy who turns out to be the ideal boyfriend, etcetera, etcetera. And let's not forget the would be rap star who ends up bagging groceries, to teach the kids a good moral lesson about why they should stay in school!And then of course, we have to have a happy, happy ending where Tee gets the guy, the car, the college acceptance AND her mother's approval.Kids will enjoy this. But I've read far, far better stuff."
3,"good product, bad if your wrx is 02 or 03",Every website I visited said this product model would fit my 02 wrx. Turns out eibach discontinued the coilover kit for the 2002-2003 wrx models and I needed to buy a replacement upper mount that was originally for an 04 wrx so it could fit my car. it cost a little over $100 for the replacement mount... not happy.
3,A bit disappointing,"While the fingerwork on this disk is phenomenal, the songwriting is uneven. There are 2 or 3 outstanding tracks, i.e., great songs as well as brilliantly played. But the songwriting by and large is uninspired and immature. Structurally, the compositions are very simple. Perhaps some will find the quirky childishness charming. I was expecting Opus One and I got Yellow Tail."
5,totally engulfed,"I begin reading Lacroix because the writer was a co-worker of mine. By choice, I would not have choosen a horror book to read. However, when I begin to read Lacroix, I found myself totally engulfed in the book. It was so intriguing that I found myself unable to put it down.If you're looking for a good book to read, I strongly recommend Lacroix. It is full of excitement, drama, romance, and mystery."
3,Okay..,"This eyebrow pencil is easy to use, and has nice staying power, however the color is off. It's not a 'khaki' {taupe} like Sephora claims, it DOES have a red/orange tinge to it that needs correcting through eyeshadow."
5,Sephora Eyebrow Pencil,I bought a couple of these while I was visiting USA last year and liked them so bought some more.
5,"A ""must have"" guidebook for Leeward Islands","I wish I had met this book before I went to St. Kitts & Nevis for the first time. It tells you everything about them and you can count on it. Very easy to find out what to do, where to go, stay and eat. Very organized and easy to read. Many pictures in this book."
5,Great book even for returning visitors,I have been traveling to Anguilla for several years but just found some new discoveries in this guidebook.
4,Good for perfecting makeup lines,"They are good for perfecting makeup lines, but I did have to get used to using them. They are not as soft as QTips (which I still use for just underneath my eye to perfect eyeliner smudges). I mostly use the rounded edge as opposed to the pointed tip (which is exactly that - pointy - you have to be careful not to poke yourself). To be fair I have not used them to actually apply makeup."
4,I was slightly disappointed in this product.,"I like these applicators because one end is pointed, the other round and flat like a paddle. The only thing I do not like is sometimes a tiny cotton fiber comes loose from the end and gets caught in my eyelash or in my eye, which is irritating if I am in a hurry and irritating to my eye! Otherwise, I am ok with this product and would recommend them to a friend with the one caveat about the fibers coming loose."
5,Great Product,I keep these in my makeup bag and use them as needed. Great if you smudge a little eyeliner or get a mascara fleck on your cheek or something. I recommend every girl keeping these in her makeup bag :-)
5,Eyes!,I absolutely love this product! I have used them for a long time and do not know what I would do without them!
4,"This book was great, for all WoD games",I liked this book because it helped me to understand the World of Darkness better. It helped my Chronical to reach new heights. I made me relize how cool this game could really be. Look whoevers reading this if you are new to the World of Darkness or just need new ideas then this book is for you.This is the long lost holy grail for WoD
1,Not for 2 1/2 exhaust pipe,"If you are trying to fit 2 1/2"" exhaust pipe this device will not work even if you ensure it is well lubricated. The standard pipe here is about 2mm thick and I had to go to a muffler shop to get it expanded. What happened was the pipe expanded about 1mm or less then the bolt snapped and the spreader popped out and ended up in the muffler, this took a bit to get out as I was assembling the exhaust and had to remove a section of pipe to get to the muffler in the exhaust tunnel. I would probably recommend getting a grade 8 or higher bolt and see if it works but I think the bolt it comes with is about a grade 3 bolt."
4,Quotable Runner,"I gave this book to my son, he enjoyed it! He was always quoting runners before, one quote at a time, now he has a book full of quotes, and it has also given him ideas about other books to read based on some of the quotes. The section on cross country was favorite."
2,"Well intended, but ultimately uninspiring.",I ended up returning this one to the bookstore after trying to push through the first few chapters...I've had easier marathons.Most of the quotes in here are long winded personal accounts that don't provide the pithy punch and true quotability I was looking for from the title.
3,Interesting...,"This book a collection of cartoons that depict people playing tricks on one another. Some are funny, but one almost feels guilty laughing at them. Since it is out of print, you can either borrow a copy from a friend or buy a used copy for a penny. Either way, it's worth it."
4,Great Cookie Iron,"A little different than my 25 year old one that burned out RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS! It took some getting used to - I had forgotten it takes a little bit to get them 'primed'! But once I got going, it was marvelous!"
3,it's just ok,"i am extremely pleased with my purchase, it is better than expected. Fast shipping, product in perfect condition, very good quality. would recommend."
5,A terrific read.,"Once I started this book, I could not put it down. Jack was a person with a great deal of athletic and intellectual talent. However, I thought he blurred the line between life and the game of basketball.I was never interested in sports when I was growing up, but this book has certainly sparked my interest. It was a mind opening experience.How did I come to read this book, considering my lack of interest in sports? I heard it reviewed on Nat'l. Public Radio. When I heard the name Jack Molinas, I remembered an athletically inclined boy that attended PS 33 and PS 79 with me. My memories of him in school were good so I think of his life as he felt compelled to live it as a tragedy."
1,Factually Inaccurate,"Caveat Emptor: This book is based in large part on interviews conducted by the late New York Post sports columnist Milton Gross, my father. They were used without the permission of his heirs, and were never checked against the audiotapes on which they were based which are in my possession and have been for almost thirty years. But what's worse is that the book is factually innacurate and the author did not even attempt to confirm what he printed. Instead of thanking the person whose work he based his book on, Rosen prints untruths about him. One example: on the last page of the book, Rosen has Milton Gross skipping Molinas' funeral and instead, attempting to cash in on his death. Milton Gross had been dead for over two years when Molinas died. He would have had to make that call from his grave."
2,fiction disguised as fact,"This book is a work of fiction.The list of errorsis too great to warrant a non-fiction label.The author makes the case that Molinas is a habitual liar.So,why would Rosen print Molinas comments in interviews other sports writers had with him without corroboration.There is no doubt that Molinas was an unusual character with huge talents who preferred to break all the rules,making him a tragic figure.It is hard to enjoy this read,because there is no way to discern truth from fantasy.I think Molinas had the last laugh with his creative tales to writers.He figured they would accept his stories as the gospel...Bob Reiss"
3,Who to believe??,"I read this book on the life of Jack Molinas over a year ago. Now, as I get ready to write a review and recommend it I find many people reporting in the reviews here that info in the book is not true. I saw Molinas play and he could control a game even in the NBA. If the truth about his life could ever be arrived at his story is a fascinating one. Norm Jones author of Growing Up in Indiana: The Culture & Hoosier Hysteria Revisited"
1,wrong book,"Sent me the wrong book. Sent message, but no reply at all.The least they should do is make contact and try to correct the error."
5,the horror on badly written movie island,"This movie was so full of lolz. I didn't die of fright but from laughter...movie was horrible one of the worst I've seen, but the commentary was so funny. Never really watched mystery science theater before but now I'm definitely a fan...will watch more for sure."
1,stupid movie,I did not purchase this stupid movie and if I could I would not have rated it anything. I would rate it ZERO.
5,A great history book that is both entertaining and informative,"As the great-great-great-great grandson of one of the very first European settlers of the Great Black Swamp (not to mention a descendent of Native Americans of the same area), I have always been interested in the history of NW Ohio. Mr. Mollenkopf is a great storyteller, and this book is filled with snippets of what life was like in NW Ohio way back when as well as historical tidbits (such as the ""Toledo War""). But it's not just for people with a strong interest in this little corner of Ohio, as it is an entertaining read for anyone."
2,Tired,"Oh God, more of this snotty New Yorker kind of humor. Grab some Perrier and chuckle at these Babbitlike witty amusements."
4,Very Good Reading,"Despite the fact that Amazon.com made the most moronic mistake I've ever seen on the internet (mispelling Lillehammer as Little Hammer) that doesn't diminish the fact that this is truly one great book. The stories are interesting and keep you hooked (I read it from beginning to end once). The only bad thing about this book is the fact that some of the pictures are not very good (most are taken straight off the TV broadcast). Other then that, if you're an Olympics buff or just a Canadian sports fan in general, this book is for you."
1,Printer Ink Review,The product did not work in my word processor like it was said that it would. The catridge fit but no ink would come out when I tried to print something.
5,Finally - A Father's Perspective,"I love my daughter. And finally I've found a resource to help me stay connected while she takes this important step...the first time in her life that I'm at a loss for words. I'm sure there are many more fathers like me that forever will thankfully remember when their daughter's first period was transformed from being her first step away to celebrating her First Moon. We all love your book. I'm sure others will, too."
2,Why religion is in this book? non-sense,"I was about to buy the book and I look inside and the intro says ""goodess menses delivers once a month...."" Why religion to explain a natural cycle of a girl's body. Mormons can buy it i won't!! B"
1,library book,This book was from a library in CA. I bought this book to replace a library book that got damaged at my house. I could not use it for my intended purchase becuase it had stickers and bar codes from another library and my library would not take it It was probably stolen since no efforts were made to remove the tags.
2,For beginners,Although the general material is comprehensive - the title is misleading - implying that it is for people studying the blues for a while without the proper information. One thing that bothered me are several mistakes in the first couple of chapters. Perhaps have an editor go through it next time.Ok for blues beginners - students already well situated in the pentatonics - take a passp.s - The Great Depression was the 30's not the 20's...
5,The best DOWN TO EARTH training book ever,"I have read a million training book and this one, by far, takes the cake. It is so clear cut and down to earth. Somehow it manages to cover every subject and keep your interest, even on subjects that you have no interest in. I would recommend this book to ANYONE who owns or works with horses. This is definately a MUST-HAVE!"
4,"Looking at Atget, again.","If you are a dyed in the wool Atget fan, and have over, let's say, 10 books of his work in your personal library, this is another you'll like to add to your collection. For those just getting into Atget, there are other, less expensive books to start with, that are not as in depth, and do not include the highly specialized section about the physical properties of the actual prints in the museum's collection. As a photographer, I found that section interesting, but the average viewer probably does not need this information."
1,I COULD JUST DIE FOR A CIGARETTE,"Angus Lynch (Joel D. Wynkoop) escapes police custody during a prison transfer. He is a pyschopathic killer who teams up with his stripper silicon sister Kasha (porn star/ prostitute Kathy Willets). Yes, there is a subplot involving policewoman Jackie Ketchum (Patricia Paul) who has a bad day when she loses her badge and boyfriend. The names are so clever, it hurts.The film has lots of blood, but the killings were low tech. It is a low budget slasher with a very irratating soundtrack. Not worth watching for free.Parental Guide: No f-bombs or nudity. Car sex scene/near nudity."
1,Creep,"This movie is terrible! I couldn't watching the hole thing and had to shut it off. First, the filming and angles were atrocious. It was like taking my old VHS camera and just start filming. Second, the acting was so bad it made Sofia Coppola look like an Oscar winner. Last, there was no plot. The script must have been written on the spot. If you want a good Sub Rosa film, go buy Undertow or Backwoods!."
5,WOW!,I saw this film in 1995 and it was Great! I can't wait for the DVD with all the extras! The Director Tim Ritter is KING! This movie is a classic.
5,pretty but-,"this is a nice looking ring and i do like the design. however i assumed it was connected or soldered together where the silver overlaps since there were different sizes. it is not connected and so the ring is unstable in my opinion and i am afraid that movement back and forth will sooner or later break the ring. sadly, i will be returning this one."
4,Silver Ring,Great price for a nice product. Shipping was quick and the ring arrived in perfect condition.
4,"History is good, mystery is mediocre....","I purchased this book via ""used"" selection. I am an Anglo junkie including reading history of early Brits, i.e. Celts. If you enjoy the history of this period (7th Century, after Arthur -- Anglo-Saxons in charge) and also like a little mystery, you might like ABSOLUTION BY MURDER. The plot hangs together well, although the identity of the perpetrator was obvious to me from the gitgo. The characters, including Fidelma, are not well developed, but perhaps the reader will learn more as she goes along. I did not find Sister Fidelma nearly as interesting as Cadfael, let alone Miss Marple.I found this story comparable to those by Candace Robb who writes the Owen Archer series, although the APOTHECARY ROSE was much better. If you like Archer, you will probably like Fidelma."
4,absolution by murder,"""Absolution by Murder"" will probably be enjoyable to anyone interested in ancient Ireland & ""England"" (Picts, Celts, Saxons, ect.)The mystery was so obvious & not all that interesting. However, there is much information on the early Church that I found interesting. Above all, this series is the only one I have found that is set in ancient Ireland & England. I would give the mystery 3 stars & the history 5."
3,Entertaining but a bit irritating.,"My first impression of this series was that the books were interesting, entertaining, and the balance between mystery and history done fairly well. The plots are sound (if not the theology, though I cannot say I am well informed about the ancient Celts). The main irritation about the books is the writing style, which detracted (at least for me) from Sister Fidelma's adventures. Tremayne's diction is not great. And in the start of every book of his that I've read he describes Fidelma as having ""rebellious strands of red hair"" peeking out from under her headpiece. That gets tiresome. Even if it is a trademark, he could phrase it differently. Still, the books are a fun read and I would recommend them. I still have to read ""The Subtle Serpent"" and ""The Spider's Web"" and ""Suffer Little Children""."
4,a good mystery with a hard to decipher plot set in 6th centu,a6th century mystery set in ireland with a female heroine.Historically well documented and the plot is much better than most of the historical mysteries i have read.Buy the first and i guarantee you will buy the next two
3,Not too Bad for a First Effort,"This book wasn't too bad for a first effort. The era is an interesting one, and there is some pretty good history here if you're interested in early Christianity and Ancient English history. Sister Fidelma is no Brother Cadfael, and her tame puppy partner (Brother Eadulf) is not Brother Michael (Susanna Gregory's secondary character), but there is something here that bears reading at least another in the series. I found that I had the murderer long before the unveiling, but I still enjoyed reading how they were going to prove it. The motive was also pretty apparent. I will reserve judgement until after I've read one or two more in this series."
2,"Interesting history, clunky writing","The Sister Fidelma books are about a fascinating period in history, but Tremayne is one of the most excruciating and clunky writers I've ever had the misfortune to encounter. I spent one book counting the number of times he uses the word ""grimaced"" (approximately once every ten pages and often incorrectly: she grimaced bashfully). The guy's a knowledgeable historian but not a novelist. There's a LOT of repetition, not just within one book, but from one book to the next -- he just lifts chunks of text and transposes them, as if it's too much trouble to write something new. I've read the first handful of these books and then just gave up expecting him to improve as a writer. The introductions to the time period and conditions in Ireland are far more interesting than the stories."
3,"Background is good, characters so-so","Tremayne brings a wealth of knowledge and interesting history to his stories, but his characters breathe no life. While he *says* Fidelma has a sense of humor, her face shows youth and enthusiasm, she never *shows* that in her actions. Her character always seems forbidding, steeped in ancient writings and law, without much use for love or warmth. It's too bad these flaws exist, as again, the background is truly remarkable."
4,Sufi Healing,"A great window from a good insider into Sufism and its outlook on human health being a state of body, mind and soul on a quest for unity with the Divine.A perspective with time tested advice good for all times."
5,I have loved this recording since I got it on vinyl years ago,"Mose Allison recorded other versions of the song ""The Seventh Son"" but to my mind none to equal this one. I no longer have a turntable, but I would have bought the CD just to hear that one song. That the CD has a rich list has others, such as the memorable ""If You Live"" plus a long list of delicious instrumental numbers as well, makes this one of my favorite jazz recordings.Mose Allison is a unique artist. There is no one quite like him."
2,I clicked on the size I needed and received a shoe two sizes bigger,"I clicked on size 5.5 but received a 7.5 I'm a girl so this was a little big. The shoe was great, but because of the sizing issues I ended up giving these to my niece (whom they would fit) and bought a similar shoe through Journeys."
3,Police Ground combat,Recieved this produce in a timly manner. My computer DVD software needs repareTherefor i can not watch this DVD to evaluate it.
5,"Colorful, imaginative, and very fun!","A science fiction/comic book style story that teaches a bit of science and maybe a moral lesson or two along the way.The illustrations are colorful combinations of computer graphics and hand drawn illustrations, with lots of hidden details.The ""blobbie"" characters are fun, good natured, and very attractive to kids.There are 2 pages with information on geometric shapes and 2 pages with information about colors and personality.The hardcover book comes with a cd with computer games and the fun ""Blobbiesong""."
2,Here Come The Blobbies,I was thinking it would be suited to a very young child. The words used were more suited to an older child that would already be reading. You find yourself having to stop frequently to interpret words used. I would have appreciated an estimated age range listed. Interesting story line for an older child.
1,Awful,"A mindless, inane book. The story is dull. The focus on terminology of complex shapes was lost on our young children. All they got out of this book is that there are ""bad blobbies"" out there. Great, more nightmares. Don't buy this book."
1,Simply awful,"I've read dozens of books to my kids and this by far is the worst. There is no subtlety in the story, as well as the artwork, and quite frankly, I find the ""video gamey"" subject matter for the book inappropriate for a young child. I really regret buying this book."
1,Buyer Beware,"First off, its rusting, secondly, the door broke off its hinge. I am very disappointed in the quality and would not recommend purchasing this item."
5,More than I expected.,"Absolutely nice firepit, it looks great and it is ready to be used, very light weight and easy to assemble together."
1,Poor Quality,I received the merchandise quickly. After 10 or 11 fires the screen door hinge broke. I contacted Kay directly and they guaranteed me a new part. I'm still waiting for the part. Don't waste your money.
4,Outdoor entertaining,The fireplace was purchased as a housewarming gift. They love it. Looks good and works very well. Great for evening entertaining on cool evenings.
3,"still ""breaking"" them in...","Sheets are a great price - look great...Quite stiff and rough on the skin. I am still giving them the benefit of the doubt, hoping that continued washing will soften them up. Obviously, they will last, but I wonder if they will every feel as ""luxurious"" as my 400 ct sets?"
4,A TEEN-AGER WHO GETS INSTRUCTIONS FROM HER ALTER-EGO,"Faith Duckle is the main character and ""the fat girl"" is her alter-ego. No one ever sees the fat girl, but she is a main force in the story. I have a tough time with many novels, but this one I enjoyed all the way through. A young teen aged girl, not socially acceptable, has many problems with most everyone including her mother. Half way through the book she earns stability through her own efforts after hooking up with a circus. You could certainly say that Faith is a mixed up kid and in the end she is an excited, accepted young lady. A good read."
5,excellent runaway story,"it's the classic setup- running away to join the circus- with a twist. a young girl with a weight problem raped under the bleadchers has lost weight and become a new person after an attempted suicide attempt and a stay at a mental hospital. she is faced with her ever present, ever eating shadow of her former fat self who whispers things to her about who to trust and what to do to get revenge. when she carries out this revenge on the guy who pinned her down she has to escape her hometown so she sets off to join the circus. her journey to find the circus is tough and upsetting but she grows up and begins a new life along the way"
3,not to be redundant...,"...but I also had a problem with the ending of this book. Its starts of wonderfully - and I even enjoy the circus part of the book - but why do we need to know so much about the circus soap opera? And if you are to be indulged by the side melodrama, then give me more. Don't just nit-pick and tell me parts of stories - tell me the whole thing. From beginning to end. I didn't feel like any part of the story was completely resolved - what she'd done before she left, her relationship with her mother, her relationship with Charlie or herself, any drama at the circus, or even her random new found love. Where did he come from?And Charlie's real secret was obvious from the beginning - I really wanted it to be more complex than that.Had real potential to be very good with a different type of story line, but it just falls short."
4,We'll Miss Her,I thought this was a lovely book and looked forward to more from Amanda Davis. Just read that she was killed in a plane crash with her parents on February 18th 2003.
1,Stunning in its utter lack of insights,"What a forgettable waste of paper (and my time). There isn't one insight, one surprise, one bit of pathos between the two covers. And obvious? The book practically jumps out of your hands and conks you on the head with its lack of subtlety. If you're looking for an interesting, meaningful and riveting tale about a journey, try Life of Pi. (Or The Odyssey.)"
5,From Bookreporter.com,"""Davis has created a lucid, compelling page-turner that defies categorization.This is a stunning novel and Faith's story is uncomfortably tragic, brutallyhonest and beautifully rendered. It is about pain and rebirth and the realitybehind all illusions. WONDER WHEN YOU'LL MISS ME is, quite simply, a greatnovel.""--- Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman"
3,Terribly sad beginning,"This is a book that begins with the revelation of a horrible event in a young girl's life. The details unfold as the novel progresses, and the reader is able to feel the pain and to understand the fragmentation of her personality to include ""the fat girl."" Joining the circus is an effort to belong somewhere after commiting an act of violence herself. This book has several levels, but it does come together at the end when the adolescent ""coming of age"" evolves and the dual personality is merged. I did have a little trouble keeping all the circus characters straight once they began to interact with ""Annabelle."" This is a book that would do well in sequel form. I am interested in finding out how Faith's life continues to evolve."
3,mmmm...it's ok,"I am a fan of Kathy's and I have to be honest and say that I am much more impressed with her website and ""La Casa Loca"" than I am with this book."
2,Disappointing,"I should have taken the advice of the ""mean"" review. The photography is nice and it would be a good book to use with children, but beyond that I was not impressed with the projects. I'd want them around my house about as much as a macrame owl plant hanger. I do think the ""Soldier's Prayer Shrine"" is a nice idea given the current climate of our country. The ""Ultimate RV Shrine"" in the gallery is interesting and I would have appreciated directions for it!"
4,From Country to City: Comments on Migration to Ashtabula Co,"I have just completed reading Carl Feather's Mountain People in a Flat Land. This book tells the stories of migrants from West Virginia, who left for the jobs in Ashtabula County, Ohio. As one who was born and raised in Ashtabula County during 1948-1971, it brought back memories. Many of the people were people I worked with at the Electromet, or were with friends with my parents. I could hear the noise and the danger,as my father worked there for 25 years. It is a wonderful addition to anyone looking for works on local history. While it does not have the scope of Studs Terkel,one realixes not all migration was to the big cities, but to the many small towns in Ohio who had similiar factories. While I enjoyed reading the book, I was left with a sadness, since many of the shops no longer exist nor do many of the people including my parents."
3,Knockoff of the Magic Bullet,"The product itself is functional, for small parties. If you want to hold a big party like you see on the infomercials, get a few of them. There is NO recepe book with the Miracle Bullet, so you will have to find your own recepes. Better yet, buy the Magic Bullet package instead. I don't own a Magic Bullet, but it seems to do the same thing.I brought this item on sale at the end of March 2006. The product description said there are 23-pieces. That's more than what you'd find in stores and on other websites. But the description is false! There are only 19 pieces in the box. It says 19-piece ON THE BOX. I asked Amazon for an exchange, and again they sent me a 19-piece box. After several strong worded emails, the credited me for the purchase. I don't think the 23-pieces set exists, it's just faulse advertisement on Amazon's part and now a month later, Amazon is still haven't change the description."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I bought this machine hoping to use it for a variety of chores.1. Chop vegetables like onions, peppers, etc for omelets and basic recipes.2. Grind coffee3. To make protein shakes and smoothies.When I try to chop vegetables it makes them into a soupy mess. When I try to simply pulse the machine it sticks or locks and instead of pulsing it purees and wont stop until I turn it a bit and unlock the mechanism. By the time I make the machine stop the vegetables are a mess and the machine smells like it is burning rubber if I unlock it too fast. This is because the gear keeps moving and rubs against the lid piece. I feel this could break within a week of use, but I wont find out because I am going to return it today. So I didnt bother to check out if if would grind coffee or make shakes, it already failed my first test."
5,Best release by Mr. Welling to date,"I have been a big fan of Mr Wellings childrens books since a local grade school turned my daughter on to a copy of 'Andrew McGroundhog and his shady shadow'. I was then in touch with the author via his website (http://www.peterjwelling.com), and he notifies me of upcoming projects. This book, his latest, is my facorite to date because of my love for indy-car type racing. Although I am primarily a CART fan, this book is more 'general', and references 500 history in general, including a touching dedication to Tony Bettenhausen. His works are so refreshing compared to most childrens books, which are repetitive and boring. A must have for anyone with children, and a thirst for challenging reading that teaches AND entertains, something that is hard to accomplish and rare to find. A five star read. Cant wait to find out whats next........."
3,Unobtainable Beauty,My copy of this was one of the limited edition collectors series and sadly the only thing I can play it on is the computer. My Philips system refuses to recognise the disc. To hear the album I have had to burn a copy to play on my Stereo system. This appears to be a problem with the disc as nothing else creates this problem.The music itself is pure beauty. I would highly recommend that everyone finds a way of hearing this album but be wary of the numbered collectors edition.
5,Great Record,"I just found a VG Sleeve, NM Record, original on Kapp of this at my local Record Shop. Great record. Maybe I should keep this original copy after reading about suspect sound quality on the reissues.Anyway great stuff. Very impressive."
2,Great Music Bad Sound,"I love Linda Perhacs voice and music. I'm not sure what cd they are listening to in the Product Description ""so here we come with a gorgeous, tremendous sounding reissue of the legendary album""Yes her voice sounds amazingly clear but the cd suffers from that ""seashell"" sound in the background. I listen to my music with good Audio Technica headphones and its really quite distracting."
5,A Thing of Beauty...,"...is a joy forever. Linda Perhac's voice is pure and true; this album is a long-lost treasure from the sixties and yet, like the work of Nick Drake, the songs are both timeless and contemporary. ""Hey Who Really Cares"" is one of the most poignant and moving tracks I have ever heard; and is just crying out to be included in an important mainstream movie soundtrack. Inventive harmonies, spiralling guitars, trippy touches, and above all written from a woman's point of view, light some candles and allow Linda's pitch perfect voice to enfold you. Linda, if you're reading this, please please record some more music as the world is a lesser place without your talent."
4,Classic stories by a talented writer. Some of them very good.,"I was particularly interested by the Minority Report story (having seen the movie first). It's rare to find unique plots. The stories are pretty hit or miss, but there are a few gems."
2,Nothing special,"Was hoping for a sensible sturdy picture frame, this Barely passed for the price looked and felt cheap, saw something in target for the same price and the quality was south better"
2,Disappointing,This book wastes too many pages covering general Grid Computing history and direction. Not enough detail on Oracle-specific Grid computing.
2,Put it back on the shelf,"Yeah, I liked this book better when it was called Rebel, and even then, Rebel wasn't so great either. Granted, romance novels are generally churned out with similar plots, similar characters, etc... however; Heather Graham basically takes the characters from Rebel, renames them and then switches their loyalties. Basically, Risa is sweet and boring and Jerome is a weaker Ian. I wouldn't recommend this book. Pick up one of her Shannon Drake novels instead."
2,too many repetitions,"This book has a nice begining (about 30 first pages out of about 300). What happens afterwards, seems a movement on a spiral. With a refren ""you are a rebel; no, you are a rebel"", all the sexual encounters of the heros consistenly occur in the same setting: close to water (ocean, lake - whatever). Plus several rather predictable splits and reconciliations. All in all it becomes a rather boring read. The historical setting is rather fresh (Florida, Civil War), however, it is described rather vaguely and not very believable."
5,Haven't read Surrender yet,I have read Captive and Runaway. I have Rebel but there seems to be a book missing because Runaway ended in the 1930s as did Captive. Rebel seems to start in the 1860s. Is there a book in between? I know Glory is the fifth book. Which is 4th and which is 3rd. Is there a book that talks of James's and Jarrett's kids growing up?
1,I've seen better.,"This is just another ""kit"" with very useless things in it. Honestly I only wanted the nail clippers and the brush/comb. I should have gone with a cuter set for a girl. I used the medication syringe for a med for my 4yo and it didn't even hold the medicine, it leaked out all over the place (no suction like a syringe should have). As a pediatric nurse I'd prefer a higher quality medication administration kit. Also the bulb syringe in this kit is small and won't be very useful. Use the one from the hospital if you deliver in one (we're having a homebirth and I ordered a hospital grade bulb syringe instead). This kit was a waste of money, in my opinion."
2,Cheap,"Although the idea of having all of these handy items in a nice case is a good one, the items in the case are pretty cheap and the case takes up too much space unnecessarily.The bulb syringe doesn't suck anything and its very stiff. The thermometer takes forever to take the temperature and I am not convinced it does it accurately. The nail clippers were difficult to use on soft newborn nails, but now that our baby is 3 months old its a little easier to clip her nails with it.The comb and brush are not bad.As for the rest of the stuff in the kit, an opportunity to use them has not come up.As for the case, I recycled it.I would have rather gotten a good bulb syringe (which I am about to order) and a very good nail clipper like the Tweezerman brand (though they are quite expensive compared to this)."
3,It's ok,"I like the kit, but it does not get 5 stars b/c the thermometer never worked and the aspirator is not as big as it should so it takes more effort to get the job done, and it's annoying."
3,Wouldn't have put it on the registry if I knew better,"Some of the products within the kit are good (the brush, the nail clipper, and the thermometer), but many of the others are useless. Also, the kit itself is IMPOSSIBLE to open. I ended up throwing it out and putting all the items in a bag on the changing table. Seriously! I can't open it without my husband's help. It's absurd!"
1,2005 Was Much Better,"Not Moving. Not Funny. Not worth the money. Go with the 2005 Short Films. ""Our Time is Up"" is phenomenal."
2,Keep looking,"These earrings looked perfect in the picture. They were well shaped and not too big. I am not a fan of large earrings. Their only failing is that they don't match in color. One of the earrings is almost black and the other is a little darker than royal blue. When you put them together, it looks like you put on one earring each from a different set. I have even had comments. I would say that you need to look for a different manufacturer that does a better job of matching the earring pair."
4,Analogies,"I purchased this book for my daughter who is starting Kindergarten this year to work on during the summer. She and I had a lot of fun with this book. Some of the activities require you to cut out pictures from a page, but there is a different activity on the back of that page. So you kinda have to work around the cutting by numbering them or something. All in all it was appropriate for her skill level, so we might try the next one in the series."
4,Good beginner's workbook,I have a very bright and capable 5 years old who loves doing logic and critical thinking workbooks. She has done one analogies book before and then I bought this one (based on some previous review). I am happy with this one and it is a good starter for beginners.
4,Japanese Import version of A Tribute to the Priest,"This particular cd is the Japanese version of A Tribute to the Priest that has a blue cover with the picture of a priest on it. The tracks on it are the same with the exception of track 3. The product description by Amazon has track 3 listed as the Sentinel which is incorrect. Actually, on this version track 3 is Beyond the Realms of Death covered by Onmyo-za, vice the live track of Delivering the Goods covered by Skid Row. Onmyo-za does an excellent job. Musically they nail it and the vocals are very good as well. If the cd actually included both songs along with the rest of them, it would be a five star rating for sure. Both versions of the cd are very good. It was annoying having to pay over [...] bucks just to get the one track but when I heard Onmyo-za's version on You Tube I bit the bullet and got it."
1,stupid nonsense,"Everything you need to know about this preposterous weapon of Satan that is isolationist, backward, un-Christian KJV-Only-ism can be learned by James White ministries."
4,Great Commentary,Phillips is the standard in Bible commentaries in that he consistantly gives a biblical perspective in an easy to understand format.
4,Hebrews Commentary,Phillips does a good job - has several good illustrations and stories to help paint a clear picture of Hebrews.
5,HP 8250i Internal IDE is awesome!,"This burner was amazingly easy to install and easy to use. It writes flawlessly at 4x speeds. I can use my computer to surf the net, or do other things while a burn is taking place even though I have only 32mb RAM. It acts like a SCSI drive. I would HIGHLY recommend this drive as a good starter CD-RW. It's fast, easy to use, and not too expensive. I'm a VERY satisfied customer."
4,Good quality CD burner from the reputable HP,"yeah i think this burner is good quality. everywhere i looked for burners, HP scored high in quality and value. so i like this burner. as jar jar binks would say: mesa likesa thisa burner a lotsa! my only complaint, like the preevious review, is of the software. with adaptec 3.5, you cant drag and drop mp3s, you have to convert them into wav format. WACK! other than that, good burner, easy to install."
2,Terrible Support -,"I bought an external version of this product and returned it for the iomega product - which works fine.While the software that comes with this may be OK for recording music - it is not sufficient for creating CD's with software on them. Specifically, one cannot write a customized volume label on the CD - It writes one for you. So your CD is labeled X56zsFSFD: (or something similar) when you open it in ""my computer"" (or explore it in the windows explorer).The worst part is the customer service! I educated quite a few HP technicians on what a volume label was. Every single one thought it was a sticky label that you paste on the front of the CD. It took about 1 zillion emails to HP ""support"" - each one with a different technician - to find out that their product just couldn't do the job. All this while I was on a tight schedule to deliver the CD's!I bought the HP CD writer without much research - I thought, ""It's an HP how bad can it be?"" Well I found out."
3,HP support stinks!,"I've had this CD-Writer for about a year now therefore my guarantee is over. I never had trouble with this unit, in fact i was delighted with because it had never corrupted a CD-R while burning it until it stoped burning them. I called HP support (that's long distance, cause I live in the Dominican Republic) and mailed them a thousand times and they couldn't help me so when they saw they couldn't do nothing they just told me i'm sorry there's nothing we could do and didn't even recommend a store were I could take drive to fix. That also happened with my HP 49G Calculator. So my advice after all this is don't spend 180 dollars like I did on a pretty good drive that someday soon is gonna wreck and you'll be left high and dry but HP support."
4,From the cover,"From the back of the book:Despite the frequent use of the term ""children of God"" to describe graced human existence, Christian theologians rarely consider childhood as an explicity theological topic. The author argues that vulnerability is a dimension of the imageo Dei, and suggests that childhood provides a window for understanding the shapes of graced human life and the violence that inhibits life. By offering a fresh understanding of the vulnerable child in the image of God, he presents a compelling reinterpretation of sin, church practice, and Christian witness in a world in which the threats to children's lives-poverty, child labor, war, and the sex trade-seem overwhelming."
5,Inspiring Book,One of the most profound books I've read. I bought three copies to give to friends. Will order more of his books for future reading and inspiration.
5,It has changed my life,What a look at the three persons in the parable and how we are all of them! I have never experienced a book that so magnificently gave me the message of being God's Beloved and being welcomed into His light and home. Nouwen's images are powerful as usual.
2,Do you agree?,Not one of the best of Nouwen's books. I expected him to tell more about the parable and not about his reaction to the painting.
3,"the ""other"" son","Best part: the chapter on the elder son, the one stayed, the one who demands penance from his little brother, the one who doesn't understand his father's tremendous compassion and forgiveness"
1,Bad edition,The edges of the pages are all of them mismatched. Thit is the reason that make this book a bad election for a gift.
5,The Return of the Prodigal Son: A Story of Homecoming,"This book was enlightening and life changing. It's a wonderful, and I believe, accurate picture of Who our heavenly Father is: I think that God is often and very unfortunately inaccurately/insufficiently portrayed by our churches and elsewhere. The challenge is to become like our Father as Nouwen suggests. (I tried it at my workplace)! thank you so very much for making this book available at an affordable cost.Elizabeth Kaiser"
5,The Return of the Prodigal Son,A wonderful book and a good read for anyone who is uncertain about their purpose in life.
3,A Forced Work,"Though a Nouwen classic, and one that many find life changing, I was left cold by what seemed to be a forcing of ideas into the parable of the prodigal and Rembrandt's painting. Both forms are open to interpretation, with is part of the appeal of parable and painting, but some of Nouwen's conclusions seem very out of the realm of both sources. As with most readers of the parable, Nouwen sees parts of himself in both the prodigal son and in the elder son. Nouwen then expresses a desire to be more like the father. These seem, 18 years after publication, to be well accepted interpretations. What is not common is Nouwen's assertion that both sons are examples of Jesus. Stretches like this left me questioning. Nouwen does have wonderful insight on how we miss so much joy around us and the struggle of forgiveness."
4,Response to Mr. Landrum,"In spite of what he (Mr. Landrum) may say, I think he may have possibly missed the entire point of Mr. Nouwen's book. Forgiveness. Even if you didn't agree with Mr. Nouwen, why rip the man in half? If you read the Bible more often, you might realize Christ's point is forgiveness, and love. No where does Christ tear someone down in the way you have done. Use Christ as your model please.That being said, I feel this book is good, however, I feel many Nouwen books are good for teaching us new ways to apply old classic stories, as he has done in this book with the story of the podigal son. This was my first introduction to Henri J.M. Nouwen. I use Nouwen as a quick read to introduce new thoughts into my spiritual life, and this book does just that. I recommend it as a great introduction to Nouwen, use it. I only rate it as a four b/c I couldn't give it a five, there are minor problems with it, but those problems are just that, minor, hardly worth a rating of 1."
5,I haven't read another book that changed my life so much.,"I was given the book as a gift. I would not have thought to buy it on my own. I was surprised and amazed at the ability of the author to speak so easily and personally to the reader. The flow of the book was so natural that it was easy to lose track of the time spent reading. It touches on parts of personality that are inherent in all people, which makes it relevant to all people. It is a terrific book that takes you on a tour of your conscience and characteristics, good and bad. I see the potential for everyone in my life to benefit from this book, from my husband to my parents to my boss to my friends."
4,Decent Book,"Purchased this book only because i needed it for a class. I didn't buy it new, but the used copy i purchased was in good condition. Almost new. I didn't even pay the cost of half the price of a new book. Thanks Amazon. Book was ok, found that it dragged out but again, it was for a class."
5,The Compassionate Father,"Nouwen brings a wonderful focus on the father as the focal point of Rembrandt's masterpiece. His face aglow with love, his hands both comforting and compassionate, the aged man welcomes the repentant son back into his fold, while the dramatic gaze of the elder brother radiates resentment. As one seeking to be a father-type to God's people, I was deeply moved by the insights that God gave Nouwen through his meditation on this painting. Like many, I have walked the journey from forgiven prodigal to self-righteous elder brother to, hopefully, a tender, accepting father seeking to model and extend the unfailing love of my Heavenly Father."
5,A beautiful invitation to enter into the love of God,"This is my favorite book of all time. Through sharing his painful experiences and his soul searching, Father Nouwen invites the reader to begin to experience the embrace of the all loving Father. He asks us to begin our journey to our own homecoming. I have read this book several times and each time brings new spiritual insight."
3,don't be fooled!,"note that even though this audio interface claims 4 inputs and 4 outputs, the output channels all reference the same audio stream (i.e., you can't have two independent stereo outs, like a dj might use in cue'ing tracks). Seemed like a good, solid tool, but I sent it back before using it because I was deceived by the claim of 4 output channels."
3,It's Good,"I'm having trouble figuring out how to get it to sync with my Logic Express software. I wish there was a tutorial that walked you through the process. Otherwise it seems to be a pretty good product. I just haven't been able to use it yet. I didn't care for the Cubase LE software that was free with it and didn't want to pay to upgrade, that's why I went with Logic because I think it's more user friendly."
1,Not Windows 7 Compatible,PreSonus has terrible customer support and has not released drivers for Windows 7. Check out their tech support forum and you will notice many unhappy customers. Look elsewhere for a recording interface.
1,Never Judge a movie by it's cover,I love horror movies and when I saw the cover of the DVD had a clown on it I thought to myself I have to have it.. I was very disappointed when I got home and started watching it. I didn't even finish the whole movie. It was a waste of time and money!! I wish I would of read more about it online..
1,well......,"Where do I start? It can't be called a horror movie because nothing scary happens. It can't be called a slasher because even when a head gets cut off there is no blood. It's not a porn even though there are 3 sex scenes (1 of which has minimal nudity). The actors probably aren't good enough to act in a porn flick. The writing is horrible. For example, a 5 minute conversation takes place where every form of the word do, (do, did, does, don't didn't) is used about 10 times each. (did you do this, no i didn't do this, i don't do this stuff, who does this stuff, I don't know) i didn't exagurate that at all. At one point, the clown ambushes someone in the woods. He rips through a random wall of black construction paper in the middle of the woods. hmmm....big sheet of construction paper, plus woods, doesn't make sense. This would be 5 stars as a comedy. It is absolutely hillarious to hear these people act. GET THIS DVD AND ADD IT TO YOUR COMEDY COLLECTION!!!!!!"
1,RETARDS SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO MAKE MOVIES!!!!,"I WOULD RATE THIS CRAP NEGATIVE 5 STARS IF I COULD. THIS MOVIE IS A PIECE OF TRASH!!! THEY NAMED THIS MOVIE ""SICK"" BECAUSE THE VIEWER IS GUARNTEED TO GET SICK BY WATCHING A VERY POORLY MADE, SORRY EXCUSE FOR A FILM. THE ACTING,THE STORY, AND THE CAMERA WORK IS PITIFUL. MY DOG COULD MAKE A BETTER MOVIE THAN THIS. ANYONE WHO WAS INVOLVED IN MAKING THIS CRAP SHOULD BE DRUG OUT INTO THE STREET AND SHOT. IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT COMMITING SUICIDE, THIS WILL PUT YOU OVER THE TOP. IF YOU LIKE THIS GARBAGE, THEN YOU NEED MENTAL ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY!!!! WHY THIS IS EVEN FOR SALE IS CRAZY. WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD BUY THIS. I WOULDN'T TAKE IT IF SOMEONE PAID ME TO. IF YOU RUN ACROSS A COPY OF THIS TRASH, DO MANKIND A FAVOR AND TAKE IT OUT AND BURN IT!!"
2,Looks are decieving,"I was hoping for cheesy and campy, but this was just plain bad, i love cheesy horror movies, and all this was, was a horror soap opera! it was by far the dumbest movie i have seen in a very long time! seriously, i know it looks really cool but its not! its horrific! and its not scary in the least bit! its not funny either! just really really slow moving and dumb! if you like soap opera's then check it out, other wise stay away from it! this movie doesn't even deserve half of a star!"
1,Very bad movie,"Ok, I don't normally rip B movies that have some sort of thought put into them, but this one is just plain bad!!! Everything sucked about this movie. Don't waste your time or money buying or renting it. Go with ""Silent Hill""."
1,Pure Garbage!!!!,"This miserable exuse for a movie is not worth watching! Do not waste your money or your time. I bought this garbage at blockbuster because the back synapse sounded pretty good. I knew it was a low-budget movie but some of those turn out pretty good (i.e. ""CARVER"") but this was soo bad. The actors were horrible, the effects stunk, and the story didnt even make sense. I tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other mom & pop store that buys used DVD's and neither would take it. So I threw it out. I dont know who would even agree to do a film as bad as this. I love Horror movies and books and trust me this was GARBAGE!!!!!!"
1,worst movie ever....,"worst movie I've ever watched in my life...and I actually like cheesy horror films. But this was a waste of time.. I want my 120 minutes back. They must have spend more money on the cool cover design than what they paid the actors/crew. It's sad that people will invest money into a movie like this to get it out in store shelves, with a cool cover that makes it seem like the movie is worth watching..and yet grab some random actors from the streets and record them saying random like with a home camcorder.Please don't waste your money.. there is nothing funny about this movie either, even though the acting is terrible. I'd much rather watch the Head-On commercials in repeat mode than watch this movie again."
1,Yet another homemade low budget horror movie,"I have to say, I don't mind low budget, but I REALLY HATE homemade quality films. I felt like I was watching something with the quality of a used car lot commercial. Anyway, they just don't make them like they used to. I'm not going to give you a run down of the film because that's what a synopsis is for, right? I'll just say that if you're looking for something well made and scary this isn't it. Look elsewhere people."
2,Mixed feelings,"Personnally, I wouldn't want to give this movie any less than 4/10 (a fact worth mentioning since 'X out of 10' seems to be more popular than 'X out of 5', even if this site uses 'X out of 5'.That said, this movie really, really isn't for everyone. It's not even for the majority of people. It's not the usual slasher stuuf, so I guess it could be seen as dissappointing in the same way Halloween 3 is dissappointing.I personnally liked the scenes with the chacacter interaction, even if it was most of the movie.Okay, I guess its time to stop rambling... I gave this movie 2 stars and not three, because, although I personnally like it, I wouldn't recommend it to the majority."
1,Oh Man......Whoa,"This movie sucked. Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I don't think the star of this movie will be winning any Oscars any time soon. Story was kind of a ripoff of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, only it sucked. Very low budget, matter of fact I think it had no budget. This and TCM 2 are the worst movies I have ever seen, horror or otherwise. Good thing I didn't pay anything to watch it."
1,S.I.C.K 101,"This movie should've been called, B.A.D(Boring Absolute Disaster). This movie was about 80 minutes too long. I am all for low budget B-flik movies, but come on.For those who are even condisering renting this movie, only rent it if you really want to laugh. The tag line reads, ""Unlike other horror movies, this is really, REALLY, Scary."" That's bull. This movie is very predictable, and has been made before. Ever seen Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is it, but with a clown.You've been warned."
1,this was lame,"THis was really lame, dont let the links with ""SAW"" make you think that this is anygood at all. look at the average customer rating!!!If you want to see something sick i saw this the other day -http://thesickestthing.blogspot.com/looks like it could become quite interesting..."
1,OMG,Please note that I have a very big tolerance for b-slasher movies... But this was terrible. The acting was so bad that it was almost funny (note i said almost). They tried some comedy in it but failed horribly. Had some hot girls in it but thats about it. Please avoid this movie at all costs. S.I.C.K. makes me sick (no pun intended of course....)
1,SKIP THIS MOVIE AND BUY FOOD INSTEAD,"DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THIS FILM. It's not even a film. It is some bit of trash that was captured, badly, on someone's cam corder purchased hours earlier at the local Best Buy.I'm not kidding.Don't get me wrong, I LOVE HORROR...I have over 500+ DVD titles and most are scary films. THIS FLICK WAS STUPID AS YOU KNOW WHAT.There is ""ghosting"" all over the place...like television was before cable. The picture looks as if it's being being broadcast to an antenna on top of your tv.My God, and to think that ARTISAN ENTERTAINMENT distributed this.Yes, the acting is bad. If you like to see unemployed people say things badly, then go for it and buy the movie.CABIN FEVER wasn't all that fantastic, but it was a heck of a lot better than S.I.C.K.A fun movie to buy would be WRONG TURN. Now that was a good horror movie.mike"
2,Wow,"Ok, I just finished watching this movie and it was terrible. I had to give it 2 stars though because I was cracking up through the whole movie. It was so corny it was nearly like-able.I wouldn't buy it...the ending is horrid."
1,"Run away, now!!","I really don't even know what to say about this movie. I apologize for not following my usual format, but this is a warning to everyone who happens to stop by and read this :PLEASE, AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!I cannot stress this enough. Acting was terrible, horrendous, I have found ""acting"" in adults movies better than this film. The music? Think late night Cinemax. Exactly. Clowns? Where are the evil clowns? Oh my, this would be the ONLY time in my life I can utter the words "" I KNOW I could make a better film than this one.Rating? NOTHING! It gets a big, fat, nothing. A bomb, a turkey, call it what you want. If you have been a bad little boy or girl this year than you may just find this movie in your stocking, although coal has more value than this movie!"
3,WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS WEEKEND!??,"I WOULD SAY THAT THIS MOVIE HAS SOME OF THE CHEESIEST ACTING I HAVE EVER SEEN COUPLED WITH SOME OF THE WORST CAMERA WORK EVER, BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT KEPT ME INTERESTED AND I AM GLAD I STUCK IT THRU BECAUSE THE ENDING WAS PRETTY DAMN GOOD (CONSIDERING THE MOVIE IT FOLLOWED!).THE MOVIE GETS 1 STAR THE ENDING GETS 2. I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THE ONE THING THAT REALLY BOTHERED ME WAS HOW THEY TOTALLY RIPPED OFF OFFICE SPACE IN THE BEGINING OF THE MOVIE, BECAUSE THEN I COULDN'T SHAKE THE IDEA THAT ""BRANDON"" WAS TRYING TO IMPERSONATE RON LIVINGSTON WITH HIS ""ACTING"""
3,Entertaining,"I saw this film and it actually entertained me. It maybe did not scare me that much, but it had everything you should expect from this type of movie. It actually made me laugh a few times, and for that reason only I recommend it. If you do rent or buy this just lighten up and have a good time with it. I did."
3,Bad... but in a good way!,"Great artwork and packaging mask yet another poverty row horror effort. ""SICK"" has the interesting premise of a fat psycho clown terrorizing some uninteresting characters out in the woods. Pretty standard plot, but hey... the killer Bozo is a nice touch!As bad as this movie seems on the surface, there's just something about it that I like. There's an uneasy tension throughout the film that makes the viewer actually care about what's going to happen next. Also there's a surprise ending that I didn't see coming.Adventurous viewers may want to check ""SICK"" out. It does, at the very least, live up to it's title."
1,One of the worst horror movies I've ever seen.,"If you feel like a horror movie, but don't want to worry about a storyline and plot, this may be the movie for you. I actually had to go back to understand who the ""stars"" of the movie were; they didn't really explain where most of them came from, plus they all looked like the same person.This low-budget looking film was a disgrace to horror films of any generation. Just think about it... you watch a movie with a great looking title and coverbox, and get a dud. You don't even see the killer until close to the end of the movie. It was just another amateur flick that wanted to get young viewers to see women sleep with everyone in the movie within a 5 minute span.Again, don't even waste your time in watching this movie. It's one of the worst movies I've seen since ""Dumb and Dumberer"" and ""The Scheme"" (featuring Jimmy Fallon)."
3,A Fun Movie,"What more can you expect from a horror movie. Nudity, sex and people getting killed. I actually saw this movie twice now and I liked it better the 2nd time I saw it. Yes, the acting isn't the best but it is entertaining enough for me to watch it twice. A nice suprise ending had me shocked at the end. For horror movie goers, this is a must see so give it a chance...invite me over and I'd even watch it a 3rd time."
3,good for a gross out moment,"I could not eat my dinner after seeing the entrails on the table. For grossing me out that much I give this move 3 stars. Oh, and the unnecessary T & A, I loved it!"
3,Sounds ok,When I first saw this movie it was pretty predictable on what was goona happen. It's about a few friends sitting around a campfire telling stories. One girl says she has a great idea for a horror movie. It's about a clown who is sent to entertain a little girl. The parents leave her alone and when they return the girl is gone. The men of the town take the clown into the woods and beat him. After the story the real clown comes and starts hacking people off. You get the picture. The effects are good .... C+
1,A Great Dissapointment,"First of all I have to say I am a serious fan of horror movies, every once in a while I get a chance, I go and visit the horror section on local stores. I don't know what I was thinking but I bought this movie. Perhaps it was because of the title and artwork that made it look so great. This is not my first dissapointment with horror movies, but it certainly is the greatest. The clown hardly makes any appearence, the gore is totally zero, and the characters are stupid. I consider this film to be very disrespectful toward those true horror fans like me. My warning : buy it only because you liked the artwork..."
1,Enticing cover-Horrible movie,"If you were to take porn stars & have them attempt to act in an average movie- S-I-C-K is what you'd end up with. The acting is so bad, I got through maybe the first 10 minutes before I had to take a break. There are a few nudie enticements, but you really have to suffer for it. Effects= extremely poor. All in all- I wish I had avoided this one."
1,Lion's Gate are a crappy company.,"Lion's Gate should be shot for putting out this crud. They buy all kinds of junk horror films shot on mini dv, like this and Zodiac Killer. I am banning all their crap. They can't be trusted. Maybe 1 in 100 films they put out is good or great (like SAW) but then they ruin it by releasing almost all dog feces."
1,Worst movie i ever saw,I baught this movie in a store in the mall to find out that it is the worst movie i could ever see its not scary and its looks like something i could go out side and make the acting is gay. The acters all suck really bad and i could fall asleep i never baught a movie aging without watching it 1st. Please dont watch it save your money and time
1,BAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDD !,"PFFF ! The actors are bad, the movie is bad, and the SPECIAL EFFECTS are BAD ! S.I.C.K is a bad movie !!!"
3,"Some good tips, but ....","Some good tips, but not a workout video I used more than once or twice. The video quality is mediocre."
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT ON WALKING IN HIGH HEELS,"The initial 10 second clip that we can all see IS the only part that you will see in this video talking about how to walk in high heels. This DVD is a workout video for your legs and DOES NOT FOCUS ON HOW TO WALK IN HIGH HEELS!!! I'm looking for a video that will show me how to pivot, stand straight and walk properly at the same time and how to walk in different shoe heel lengths. This video does not do it at all!!! It is a waste of money!!! I'd like to see a video that teaches people how to possibly walk in heels up or down a few flight of stairs without falling on your face. Plus learning how many inches a basic two step in high heels would help. There are a lot of people who would LOVE to learn the art of walking in high heels and feel confident at doing it, but this video DOES NOT TEACH YOU THE TECHNIQUE IN DEPTH. THIS WAS A WASTE OF MY 20 BUCKS!!! IT'S JUST A LEG VIDEO, YOU CAN WATCH THAT ON THE EXERCISE CHANNEL ON DEMAND!!!"
5,"Five minutes, and it was installed!","I just had to have a 2 line answering machine, and despite the one negative review, the Casio seemed like the best bet. It arrived, and it was up and running in 5 minutes. It offered more than I expected, and the sound quality is very good.One person said it was hard to setup and program. It's easier than a VCR, it's easier than a home computer, it's easier than most microwaves. My phone setup is kinda ugly.... the manual covered the different installation options clearly - including my unusual phone setup, and following the instructions was a snap.All in all, I think the guy who said it was awful either didn't read the manual, or got a lemon."
1,dissapointed,"My husband isn't much in the kitchen, but he means well. When I was looking for a coolbook for him I should have looked for something with a more ""for dummies"" bent. This book is something you could make yourself with a book of index cards. The content is nothing special. In fact, the recipes are about as unremarkable as they get. The only bonus is the fact that the book is one of those little flip books that stands up, so you can reference it while it's sitting on the counter. If given the choice again, after seeing the book, I would have made my own recipe book for my husband, and the gift would have been more meaninful, and it would have set me back a buck and some well invested time. Not to mention the recipes enclosed would be things we actually eat and enjoy. This book is no five star miracle."
1,BEWARE!!!,"CHECK THE BACK OF YOUR TRANSMITTER! IF THE NUMBERS READ ""REV2"", IT IS DEFECTIVE. We were sent a defective transmitter, our dog (who had been trained on the system for over a year) ran the road, was hit by a car and has a broken leg. We are lucky he is still alive. When we called the Havahart rep, she told us that a defective transmitter was sent to us."
2,"Hard to see, short battery life","I had this setup and returned it; besides the tiny display and uncertain use-time, the setup interferred with the operation of the normal funtioning of my other phones insofar as being able to pick up and talk on any extension after my phonemate 9800 had started its message-you are supposed to be able to pick up any extension and press * to shut off the machine and answer the line. While the 200 was hooked up, it was impossible to stop the answering machine, or talk to the caller...unless you were using one of those two Casio handsets. Since I have three other 2-line phones, this was intolerable."
3,"OK, but not terrific","Good points:- Lot's of color photographs showing not just architecture, but art as well.- Many different sites presented.- Enough text (about 10-15%), but not too much.Disappointments:- Thoroughness is sacrificed in favor of including more sites - I would prefer more pictures of each site.- Pictures quality is only fair to good. I was very disappointed that colors are washed out (low color saturation) even though the book is printed on heavy matte stock.- A majority of the pictures are not aerial, though that doesn't detract much for me.- Only recent photos - would have liked to have seen early photos of sites prior to excavation.- Some pictures are mislabeled.Overall, worth checking out of the library or buying used, but probably not worth purchasing new."
5,Cheap and good,It is what it is. It was cheap and the person I bought it for liked it. What more is can I say?
5,Great gifts!,"For some reason, this size frame was really hard to find in the stores. These were perfect for family gifts that I made for the holidays."
4,Allowing creativity,"This was a great frame. It was sturdy and because it was made of wood, I was able to add my creative touch my painting the border with acrylic paints to customize it. I gave it as a Christmas present and my sister loved it."
4,"Good, not Great.","I thought this product was good, but not great, I liked the wood they used and how it came shipped, but they need to work on the delivery. Took an extra two days from when it said it'd be shipped. Other than that, it was perfect for what I needed!"
1,Sent me a broke one!,"The power button was broke,I never got it replaced,thanks! First it was late now I'm stuck with useless junk,for a 100, thanks amazon."
3,"Fun, for awhile..just a big toy","I was looking for an affordable synth and this definitely is! When i got it i loved it, i was always playing with. but after a week or 2, i was bored. its very limited. theres only so many sounds, and you get bored with them kinda fast. you can only loop 8beats(2-4/4measures)and after more than 2 or 3 sounds stacked on each other the sound gets gross. i tried just running into garageband to be able to mix the sounds and all, but there are still few sounds, and theyre somewhat similiar. it is affordable and very fun for awhile, but it does get boring, kind of just an expensive toy. but if you dj are somehting, may be a good cheap little tool, just for trying to write music, not the best choice. I love korg so i dont want to bash too much, just not the greatest thing ever."
2,not as good,I waited 3 months for this to come out.when I got it I was like yesss.I was messing around with it the sound was not good an I vould only use about 20 sounds out of it out of 150.ki was not happy at all.I found myself going back to the first one the korg koss-1 it had better sounds to me.
5,Love this hat,"It is nice, sturdy, and looks great on my son. It fit pretty good when he was 6 months but fits perfect now that he is 1! Great buy!"
5,Its a good read,"If you like the Sisterhood series, this one is a good one. I always look forward to what happens with each lady and how she will come to rectify the past and those who wronged her. The series is based on what I believe is something that each of us would want to do if money, people and resources were available."
5,Sisterhood,excellent continuation of the series a must read if you thought the underdog had no options like these ladies thought untill they got together
2,Enough of Sisterhood!,"Not much different than the others in the series. Fern needs to hire another publisher as there were 5 spelling errors in this book (pages 79,85,90,112,and 151). Discouraging to find a published work with so many errors."
2,Lethal Justice- -yawn--Fern Michaels has a ghost writer!,"This book and the one just before it, are nothing of the caliber of the previous books in this revenge of the sisterhood series. Who wrote this? It doesn't read or feel like the others, and it's a big boring and not well written at all. If I'd read these two last ones first, I'd never have read the others in the series!Fern, get off your duff--you're starting to write very boring and ride on your name!"
5,Lethal Justice,Great read. Liked being able to follow the series and remembering things from past books in series. Cann't wait for next one!
4,Relax and enjoy,"I can't tell you that this book is a real thriller, but it keeps you reading.I can't tell you that it doesn't have flaws or things unexplained, but you won't be able to close it.I can't tell you that you'd love the good guys -or was it the bad guys? But you'll root and cheer for them all the way.So just relax and enjoy this reading."
5,LETHAL JUSTICE,I ORDERED THIS THRU AMAZON BUT IT WAS SOLD BY SUPER-FLY-BOOKS. NOT ONLY WAS IT OVERSIZED BUT IT WAS LIKE BRAND NEW. WOULD DEFINATELY ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!
1,Awful narrator for audio edition,"This is a review focused on the audiobook.This was a disappointing story to begin with (see other low rated reviews), but the narrator for the audio edition made it worse. The main character sounds like a feeble, tremulous 90 year old, rather than a vibrant 60 something. I think the narrator was attempting to channel Audrey Hepburn in ""On Golden Pond"" but that character was nearly 80! The narrator's version of the Japanese gal was distracting. You'll find yourself trying to figure out what exactly that accent could possible be - and it changes from chapter to chapter - rather than listening to the story. It goes downhill from there.BTW, many libraries now have this book available on CD for loan or download."
3,Big Disappointment!,"I think this was a big disappointment! The plot wasn't expanded as the others were, it seemed rushed and there were many, many typos which there have never been in any of her sisterhood books. I think it was rushed and I really don't think she wrote all of it. It simply didn't have the full Fern Michaels touch. I was disappointed completely!"
2,Lethal Justice,"Recently purchased the Kindle version for my iPhone. While the story is as good as the other Sisterhood books in the series, the type O's leave something to be desired. There are a lot of misspellings and completely incorrect words in the text making it difficult to read.I have found this in other Kindle versions as well, however this is by far the worst."
1,Yawn!,"I don't understand all the good reviews about a not very good book. If the typeface were any larger and the margins slightly bigger, the entire book would proably come in at 20-25 pages. The writing is not very good, the plot is not gripping and it is all so predictable. It seems as though we have not all been reading the same book. This was my first book by this author and also my last."
1,Absolute junk. Stay away.,Purchasing this product was a mistake. It works very poorly and was a waste of time.
1,Don't waste your time and money!,"I first bought this product from Office Depot thinking that the quality of the product would be the same as OEM. It isn't! I tried two ink cartridges with no success whatsoever. There are streaks, smudges, and lines across the page. Finally I went back and bought the OEM. Don't believe guarantees will make this the same quality as OEM!"
2,What crap! One of the worst horror films ever! such a rip-off!,"I cannot believe how crappy this low budget horror film is! This movie also is such a SUPER rip off of Friday the 13th, I think they should sue! I mean come on! ""Jason Voorhees""! ""Trevor Moorehouse""! The people who thought this one up were totally retarded! DER!!! The film was only about 23% enjoyable, and the gore was not that scary. The ending did not make sense and the there was a huge plot hole! I mean...what? This movie is not even a good rental. If you just want to see every horror movie that comes out might as well rent this and see how dumb it is."
1,Direct to video garbage,Don't waste your money. Katie Woodruff is cute but you'll hate yourself if you sit through this rubbish.
3,"Not Bad, But Could Have Been Better",I just saw this movie for the first time and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Let me just say that Katy Woodruff is HOT!!! ...
2,Even Funnier than the first!,"This is so funny, and it is bloody, so get out there and have a good laugh. It has alot of gore, some good twists terrible acting, but the acting is good when it's time for a person to die. Trevor is actually the killer in this one, but they changed his mask! I hope they make another one, but they need more kills!"
1,this is a horror film!!??,bloody murder 2 was a ok movie i give it a d+ cause the killer had a kool looking mask the chainsaw kills were great and the boob shots were awsome but it lacked a good plot cause there was people just getting killed and the ending was boreing it just ended with out any good mystery or anything it was just trevor kill his father and walks off and the remaining living people just simply walk away its really a waste of money just watch it if it was for free or if someone else is watching it
4,The Camp Right Next Door To Camp Crystal Lake...,"I got this movie strictly because It contains horror-goddess Tiffany Shepis (Delta Delta Die!, The Hazing, Abominable, Home Sick, etc.). Ms. Shepis has plenty of screen time, both clothed and sans attire. This beautiful creature never disappoints, (even when a particular movie she's in happens to stink). In BLOODY MURDER 2, Tiffany plays the wild Angela, a slutty gal w/ a heart of gold. While not the central female character, Angela is the most interesting of the bunch. BM2 is a decent film anyway, w/ its masked murderer and ample supply of knife-fodder. A fun way to waste a Saturday afternoon..."
2,Better then the 1st but thats not saying much,"This movie is betetr then the first bloody murder.this one at least has blood and gore.the story is still non exsistant and the killers mask for some reason has changed.the killer in both movies isent even who they say it is and they never even show any backstory or anyting.at least rent this one if your curious but just stay away from the first ""bloodless murder""."
4,Above average teen slasher flick,"This is an entertaining example of the teen slasher genre. A bunch of teenagers are isolated in a holiday camp cleaning up after the summer activities and closing the site down. Predictably, the one by one murder of the teenage characters by an unknown killer provides the suspense and drives the plot along. The murders seem quite well depicted and occur sometimes unexpectedly with a harder more full-on edge than in some similar movies. The movie also contains some full frontal sex scenes that spice up the camp a bit. Overall the first hour or so is entertaining and well written. The last 20 minutes are somewhat predictable as the remaining teen survivor battles to escape from the killer, struggling to find the keys to the truck etc. At this point you could probably turn it off. Overall, this is worthwhile watching, and has some intelligently crafted bits in it."
3,"I expected better film,but it is OK","As I say I expected better film,but it is OK.It has some cool gory moments/finally someone use chainsaw and machetes/,perfect setting/I love woods and camps/,but somewhere in the middle it has too much asking,talking,young detectives and so.But as I say it has his moments,and it is totally OK."
5,Blaque - Bring It All To Me (GER) Remix,"THIS REMIX IS WORTH THE MONEY! Awesome Remix's of Blaque's""Bring It All To Me."" If you loved the remix for 808, thissophmore remix WILL NOT disappoint! This is the (GER) import. Track listings as follows:1)Bring It All To Me - Main Edit ((3:47) This is the video version with just the girls singing. No N'Synch in hearing range.2)Bring It All To Me - Remix (feat. 50 Cent)(4:10) AWESOME! A well done remix, TOTALLY different sounding than the LP version. This is truly a REMIX. ""..dance with me, come and dance with me, romance with me, don't be shy, it's a natural high.."" If you love R&B that makes you want to get down, BUY THIS! Great rap between Blaque and 50 Cent really highlight this remix!3)Bring It All To Me - Remix (feat. freejazzyglaze) (4:32) - Same infectious groove as the other remix, but with more, and all female rap. The rap in this is a little harder,(...) You won't want to stop listening to this!4) Bring It All To Me - Remix (Instrumental) END"
4,"""Bring It All To Me"" without N'Sync","I bought this CD and I love the song ""Bring it all to me."" It's a great groove. However, for those of you who WANT the song with N'SYNC singing the second chorus, you NEED to get the full CD, NOT this import. I like this version because it doesn't have N'Sync, not that I don't like them...they are great. But I like the song with the girls singing all the lyrics. I really like this import. The other three mixes I don't really care for. It's not even close to the original versions, more like a different song totally with ""bring it all to me"" sung in the background once in a great while."
4,comfortable but not much art support,"These are very light and comfortable sandals but there isn't any arch support at all. They are very flat inside the shoe. They dot cut or rub your feet in any way, nor do they smell from wearing them with no socks. They naturally fray giving them a cooler look."
5,Great shoe,"These are the only shoes my husband wears when it's not snowy out! He loves the comfort and the way they breathe. I do wish they'd last a bit longer, I usually have to buy 2 pairs a year."
4,Size matters,"This is my third pair of Sanuks. I love them but it is hard to figure out their sizes. My Chibas were exactly right. My Standards ran too small. After reading the reviews here, I bought these Vagabonds a size up and when they came they were WAY too big. They do not run small! They should *just* fit because they will stretch."
5,Great sandals not shoes,"Love these sandals. Super comfortable and light weight. Not sure about the durability seeing I just got them today, but from the looks of them the design is spot on with no flaws. Now for the sizing issues that everyone seems to have much debate about. I'll straighten it out once and for all. Measuring my foot in inches with a ruler they are exactly 11.5 inches heal to big toe. That makes me an 12.5 or 13 on your average shoe sizing scale these days. I like my shoes snug with minimal room in the front to prevent blisters. So I ordered a 12 and they are a perfect fit. I can still wiggle my toes and there is about a half an inch or less at the top. So depending on how you like your shoes to fit go from there. In my opinion the sizing is true. Now that that's cleared up, I would recommend to anyone that wants a great sandal that looks like a somewhat dressy shoe, that looks great with both shorts or jeans."
1,Returned,Not to my liking. Therefore I returned. Picture did NOT do the shoe justice. Was disappointed when I opened the box.
4,I can only give a partial review..,"I can only give a partial review due to the fact that I ordered this product for a christmas gift and the person has yet to open the gift. But, I can say it arrived within the appropriate amount of shipping time and everything in the box looked good so far."
4,nice shoes,"I got my sanuks at a local department store and there is only one thing I don't like about them. They are a little too big but thats the way I bought them so... I usually wear a 10.5 but they don't have half sizes witch I don't like. My foot is still growing and if I bought a size 10 I'd outgrow them by the summer probably, so I ended up buying a size 11. They are very comfy but big. Here in a couple months they should fit better. I would give it 5 stars they are too big, other than that I would give them 5 stars."
3,Not for me..,"I purchased these sandals a while back now, have worn them twice. I have to admit, comfort is great, ive worn them on 2 occasions that involved alot of walking, while others were tired, my feets wanted to keep going.The shoe is very bulky and clumsy looking, Its hard for me personally, to find anything to wear with them. Ive only worn shorts with these sandals and my feets looked like duck feets lol. I guess Im not used to wearing sandals like these, However the comfort makes up for the weird appearance.Over all, im semi-satisfied with the purchase. I'll continue to wear them for long walks or at the beach, but def. not for casual wear."
2,Sweaty,"I really like the idea/concept, because I love just strolling around in sandals. But the problem for me was my feet got too sweaty inside. This isn't a problem for regular sandals since there's a lot of air, but when it's enclosed like a shoe it gets all sweaty. Suppose you could wear socks, but that defeats the purpose of sandals."
2,They look HUGE,I was surprised how huge these made my teen son's feet. Looked like clown shoes! We returned immediately for another brand.
5,Best sandals ever,"They are the most comfortable shoes I have. I have some never damage in my right foot. Regular shoes cause it to get inflamed, the Sanuk's are so comfortable that I can wear them all the time like my flip flops that I normally have to wear."
5,Love Sanuks!,Our entire family wears Sanuk sandals/shoes. We have purchased multiple pairs for the ladies (2) and gentlemen (3) in our brood. They are comfortable and versatile. I appreciate the Sanuk Company and their values. These shoes accomodate a wider foot and are able to be cleaned after excessive wear. My husband wore his (a lot!) until there was a hole in the bottom and then bought the same pair again to enjoy.
4,Great,They were shipped quickly. I got them for my husband and he really likes them and they are comfortable. Great casual shoe
5,Exactly What I Was Expecting,"I have several pairs of Sanuk sandals but had not been able to find a pair in black. Great price on a great pair of sandals and received them within 3 days, love the fast shipping!!!"
5,Great shoes...er...sandals,"Very pleased at the comfort these things provide. The fabric is slightly stretchy so that it conforms to your foot, and the sole is slightly spongy so it cushions your foot nicely. A little pricey, which I think is due to an attempt to be somewhat 'exclusive' among footwear, although the uniqueness of the design already accomplishes that for them. I only gripe about that because I want a second pair, but dropping another fifty bucks isn't what I'd prefer to do at the moment. Glad I bought the first pair, though."
5,Almost Like Going Barefoot,"These were recommended by my daughter for her dad who doesn't like shoes. He wanted something easy to slip on, a sole for outdoors, and something light. These Sanuks are just that. He used to wear his slippers when he was out and about, even to ball games. Now he wears the Sanuks. Thank you, Sanuk!"
5,Super Sanuks.,"Husband loves these shoes. ""Best shoes ever owned"" Very comfortable says He, look great too. Went back and bought another pair."
4,Best shoes I own,Super comfy! Super light-weight! Its like wearing sandals. I can wear these with dressy shirts and dark jeans or with shorts and a T. Simply the best shoes I've ever had. I will knock a star off though as they do wear on the bottoms a little quick.
5,walking on air,"these sandals are like walking on air. they don't even need to be broken in. they also allow you to go into places that have a no sandal policy. i wear them everywhere, love them"
3,"Absolute comfort, doesn't last long.","I got my Sanuk Vagabonds at a clearance store for $20. Having been told about them in near-legendary terms, I absolutely had to try them. They're extremely comfortable, possibly moreso than any other footwear I've had other than feyue shoes. Unfortunately, after 2 months of wearing them like I'd expect to wear any kind of sandals, the ball of my foot began to hurt. I took it off and noticed there was a big nasty bruise right on the ball of my foot. On the sandal, it had worn through more in just that spot than anywhere else. There's streaks of white showing in various spots on the shoes (sandals).I'm mitigating the issue by inserting a pair of Birkenstock insoles from a pair of clogs I used to wear. It's extended the life, but I have NO idea how anyone can get the 2-3 years they claim they get out of these unless they're wearing them for one day a week."
5,Walking on Clouds,"These are one of the greatest things to ever touch my feet. Easy to slip on, even easier to forget they're still on your feet 10 hrs later. If you need a casual shoe that's good for any occasion then this shoe and any other from Sanuk is great. When ordering just be aware to go at least one size up compared to your normal."
4,Dress down look,"My husband saw them, took me awhile to order them, but now that he has them he trys to wear them with everything he wears and everywhere he goes. Ordering them online was $20.00 cheaper. Not worth the $67.00 in the stores."
2,Sizing is different than last several pairs I've purchased,I have had several pairs of this brand shoe before and have loved them. This recent pair is noticably tighter than the previous size 13 that I usually purchased. Not sure if they have changed something in their sizing or it's just the Vagabond model. Hopefully they will stretch out as they are not the usual super comfortable shoes I love from Sanuk.
5,A book To Use For Life,"I love Robert Camp book. This book is so interesting and tells you so much. I know, I will use this book for life. It is a very important book. I was very amazed about, What I learned and now understand much more about my relationships.Its a book to know yourself and your relationships with others. Look up anyone that you want to know about and you will find out much. How that person relates to you. I can't say enough about this book. Get this book and change your life for the good. Everyone should have a copy of this Great book. Thanks so much Robert Camp for this book."
4,Missing data on 2 of diamonds.,"I like every part of the book...it seems very accurate and insightful...even with relationships...I did notice while comparing relationships...the 2 of diamonds were wrong...it's a misprint...it is exactly like the 2 of spades...so, if the author is reading this review...please fix this...thank you."
5,Love Cards Accuracy Review,"I was quite impressed with the accuracy of this book. I have the book in my car, and when I go to a friend's house, we will literally ""do research"" on ourselves or other people we know. It seems to answer the question ""why do I do the things I do?"" It's not negative in any way,and it's not judgemental. It's quite involved with the planets, and signs, etc. I am just learning about them, (in relation to myself). But the author takes you through this step by step."
1,Love Cards,This book is amazing. Look up the birthday of any person and see how things are between the 2 of you. It is uncanny how accurate it has been for me. It's an innocent enough thing to ask someone when their birthday is. Then to look up what this book says. It takes a lot of stress off because it is describing things and I don't have to take things that happen in the relationship so personally.
5,Better than Nylon,"I bought Nylon recently and it was a BIG disappointment;so I bought Kravgi and lo! the Holy Grail of Greek music was revealed to me!It's a great mix of disco,operatic,and traditional Greek music.Her voice has incredible power at times.Sad to say,going by Nylon,her voice seems to have reached it's peak here on Kravgi.All her albums previous to this one are highly recommended too.The problem is getting hold of them!Also try Natassa Theodoridou,who in my opinion, has a superior voice."
3,Was great at first but broke easily,"This product was really great at first, it didn't get jammed or anything, but after a month it broke. I felt like it was too long since I had purchased it to try and exchange it, so we just went to a hardware store to get one, but it would have been nice to get a product with a lifespan of longer than a month.Other than that, it was fast shipping, so hopefully I just got the one bad key carrier."
2,Unpredictable??,"A fairytale of a story. Details in this story that would naturally provide the background environment and setting for this story was non-existent. It left me with no mental picture of who the characters were. Because of the lack of character development, I felt nothing for them. I neither felt happy, sad, sympathetic or anxious for them. I felt as if I was reading a summary or synopsis of something greater. The potential was there but the story felt rushed through. At times, very unrealistic, including the extremely passive, 'stand by your man' attitude of the main character's wife Adrian- a 90's woman???? Mr. Fisher, I am an aspiring writer and I commend you on having published a book; I wish you the best luck on your future projects and I hope that one day someone may read my work and be as blunt as I think I just was."
4,Delta Squad,"The commandos do not bend below the waist. They have full articulation from the waist up. Their Packs are removable, but they do not have removable helmets. Weapons that come with them are the Commando weapons, really cool. The characters match the ""Star Wars Republic Commando"" video game, also ""Sev"" the red commando has a shoulder movable piece on his pack that comes off really easily. Their paint jobs are awesome.My favorite Star Wars action figures.Very playable. They are cool."
4,"Cool, but not necessarily worth it","Only get this if you want the clone commandos because the other three figures disappoint, and all clone figures are nicely detailed, but are slightly lackluster in movement."
2,Can't play cd-r's,If you want to play your own cd's (cd-r's) look for another brand that can. Technics tech support says that NONE of their units are designed to play cd-r's
2,Do Not Buy From This Guy,"The book was supposed to be ""like new"" and i came all bent up on all corners and there was a coffee stain inside one front cover and on the first couple of pages. This book has question and answer sections and you need a special paper to see the answers and this guy didnt even put it in there so basically the book is worthless to me. I am not happy at all and you wont be either."
2,plastic Brio made in China,"By looks not impressive (I cannot judge the light and sound feature because I did not open the package), made of plastic in China (though Brio) and therefore in my opinion too expensive."
5,Great Fun,"If you have a lot of train pieces, this is a great piece to have for your set. Three kids have played with this for years and it has been a steady go to piece. It has survived and is still going strong.It is battery run and the controls on the top are easy enough for little chubby fingers to operate. It has enough power that it can pull quite a few train pieces behind it.We have this one and the red one that is like this and they are both quality pieces that have lasted a long time and do a great job."
5,Fantastic reference book,This is a must have information book for any serious NASCAR fan. The text is easy to follow and it also features numerous photos and interesting details on dozens of tracks...
5,great collection but where is blackout,i loved this show mainly because of johnny depp but where is seasons 4/5 episode blackout. but overall a great series if you r a fan of depp then u must have it.
4,Decent,"Going through this you'd be amazed at how many famous people guest starred on it. I'm watching about 6 episodes a day. Got this after watching the movie come out. Great to relive my childhood in a way. As I write this I'm thinking man, I also watched that stupid show Fame around the same time."
4,Jumped back in time,I was only a toddler when this show was on but I have totally enjoyed traveling back in time with the cast. 21 Jumpstreet I would say was an awesome show of it's time. The sellers have great customer services skills and are willing to work out any issues if they arise. The only thing I do not like is that the disc come in separate sleeves and are all in one big box. Anyway you are sure to get multiple hours of action. I still have several discs to go.
4,"Interestin show, great DVD value","The morons who were running Fox in the late 1980s really crippled this show. It was fresh (not really a Mod Squad clone) with a fine young cast. But the ""suits"" made their first big mistake by replacing Frederick Forrest after 6 eposodes. The ridiculous explanation was that audience input indicated a need for a traditional top cop. Audience input? An audience of primarily teenagers who don't like or respect authority and would not mind a laid-back former hippie police captain? Add a character who took so much time away from the young actors? Just stupid! Fox just couldn't let the show be that original! No wonder Depp, Nguyen and P. DeLuise were happy to get off the show. The upcoming movie version is not something for which I am holding my breath. Maybe it will be a pleasant surprise?"
4,"Good, but suspicious","I am enjoying 21 Jump Street again, with my 17 year old daughter. The picture and sound quality are good, but there has been some dubbing to the curse words. There has been a change from PG-13 words to G rated versions. I do not understand why this dubbing has been done. No other problems have been spotted, so far, (we are still viewing the episodes on disk one). The disks are in black paper envelopes, inside the plastic box cover.21 Jump Street: The Complete Series"
3,The more you know....,"As you probably have read, this set does not have its original music.The thought and effort put into filling the shows music is kinda weak.you'll be watching car chase scenes set to ballads. Some music has lyricswhich compete with the dialog you are trying to listen to in the show.Its distracting, and you can't help but wonder how the original was.If you think you can get past it... you are good to go.I thought I could...but its really really noticeable.and not in a good way."
5,21 Jump Street TV series,Have really enjoyed rewatching the series. Recieved the DVD's in excellent shape and in a timely fashion.
4,great price for 5 season set,I recently picked this up from Best BUY for $25.99. Can't argue for that price so I am very pleased with my purchase!
4,Entertaining,"Slightly cheesy at times, but there is always a life lesson involved, and many are lessons still needed today in our society."
5,"Great, LoVè it.","I got it super fast, couple of days... And it has all the episodes. It took me like 2weeks so I could watch all these.."
5,perfect,"Exactly as described. It shipped super fast. I was extremely satisfied! I can't stop watching it, and it was a really great price"
1,"Low quality backing, don't expect it to last longer...","Than the end of 2007. Mine has faded away to be almost unreadable.Love the message, but the messenger is just scamming good, politcally motivated folks."
1,Didn't care for this book,"As a professional crafter I found no new ideas here. The money card is neat but I already knew how to make it(might be worth the price of the book). The only other card I liked was the heart one on the cover and the fresh sprigs of evergreen glued in a circle to make a wreath(not a new idea).There is one birthday card with 3 balloons and 2 Christmas cards(I just mentioned one of them).I thought the cards were not attractive, and my 16 year old daughter agreed. Unfortunately I listened to the other reviews when I bought this book. I personally love Sandi Genovese book ""Creative Greeting Cards"" which never fails to inspire me. Although Sandi's ideas use mostly die cuts,which can be expensive or tedious to cut yourself, there are plenty of unique ideas to adapt using stickers,stencils, rubber stamps or photos instead."
5,Fabulous Grill!,"This grill is the best! Holds way more food than does the original single size, and yet the footprint on the counter is not much bigger. Love it. Easy to clean and super fast to grill."
3,Grill is satisfactory but 5 burger photo is deceiving.,"The grill works fine. No complaints.But the reason I'm giving it a 3 stars is b/c the photo showing 5 burgers is deceiving at best, and false advertising at worst.If you use White Castle slider size burgers, you can probably fit 5 burgers in there, but if you're using an everyday sized burger, 3 (maybe 4) is the best you can expect and not have raw meat hanging out the side of the grill."
3,ok,"I got this item as a gift for someone and apparently with the condition it arrived in they thought it was used and asked me about it. I was very embarrassed about this. On the positive side, the person really likes the grill and uses it frequently. He even told me that he no longer uses his toaster and substitutes the grill instead."
3,cooking surface is very small,"The cooking surface is very small and the cleaning is next to impossible. If you don't attempt to clean it while its hot, you may as well throw it away. There is no temperature setting either so it cooks everything fast or it will leave burn marks on your food. I so wanted to like this product because I wanted to eat healthier but this product doesn't live up to expectations."
1,One man's opinion,"Beyond Mr. Barnes' statements there is no documentation whatsoever of his story. The bulk of the book is a collection of documents, including Mr. Barnes' address book with purported names and phone numbers of high government officials. Even if the names and addresses are real, there is no way to know if he ever contacted or was contacted by them.You can either believe this to be true or not. To me, it has the same texture of the 'Philadelphia Experiment' story; namely factual data surrounded by a mist of heresay and rumor."
3,Fine sham.,I have two of these shams. They are nice and look good on my bed. One caution lint and hair seem to stick to the chino-like material. Other than that it is exactly as pictured.
4,Beautiful poetry about every day living,"The songs from this CD are little poems with easy music. Easy but not silly. It's really amazaing how some words can creato so emotion. The voices are great, the letter's too. Maybe this is a handicap for not-spanish people, or people who don't speak spanish, but it's just like dream, like be in peace with everything around you. A CD very easy to listen. But a little diamond."
2,EN-9110,"Personally I think this monitor is horrible. It seemed great at first but then I began to notice the horrible ghosting that the monitor produced. While the monitor does have vinrant colors I wish Envision could have added a backlight for this, the montior is way too bright."
2,"Great Price, Poor Quality","I bought the Envision because of the price and what you get as far as specs.The first one I brought home would not power on. So I took it back and got a different one.The quality of the product is not that great. The plastic casing of the flat panel is just cheap. The cover on the back where you tuck in the cables has really small tabs that break off very easily, so be careful.I wish I would have spent a little extra and bought a Sony or Viewsonic"
5,Incredible music by extraordinary guys!,"This is the first band I've come across that actually combines Christianity with the musical stylings I love most - Metal. These guys are absolutely incredible and I can't wait to get the rest of their albums. If you're looking for music for your kids to listen to, get this and they'll get what they want and you'll get what you want. :) Or, if you're tired of the BS spewed by most Metal bands, get this and you'll be incredibly happy."
5,Rock Me Amadeus,"Another awesome release from Tourniquet. Tons of double bass, killer riffs and vocals. Pick up your copy today!"
5,metalheads beware!,"Tourniquet is back with a cd that could make the boys in Metallica look a little old. There is some extremely thought provoking lyrics, killer metal riffs, and some drumming that'll make your arms & legs sore. Do yourself a favor and get this METAL MASTERPIECE...no home should be w/o it!"
4,Not as good as it looks,"I was so excited when I was told that a friend had bought this for me from my wish list and although I love it and it is exactly what I wanted and it works perfectly, it sadly does have some faults. In my opinion it is made of flimsy material - that being that it looks to be made of metal but it is really made of thin plastic. The touch screen is really a press hard screen and the screen is not backlit. These are not big things but if you are aware of these things you may think twice.The only other thing that was of concern to me was that product does not come with the cord to download to your computer - but this is just another case of buyer beware.But over all it is a fine product in the sense that it does what it says it was going to just not as nicely as it looks like it would"
1,Not worth it.,The first HealthFit counter unit I bought was defective. The touch screen would freeze and type the wrong letters. I returned that unit for a replacement. The second unit was the same. I had to keep pressing the letters 4-5 times before it would register. I bought this for convenience and I don't have the time to fuss with this. It took 10 minutes just to enter 1 food entry. It would be much easier to just write it all down in a paper journal. It was not worth the money. There must be something better out there.
1,Disappointing,"It did all that I wanted it to do but I had to replace the batteries every day. First I thought it was the cheap ones that came with it so I put Duracells in but the next day, those were dead too. I'll be sending it back for a refund."
1,Waste of money,I bought an Hp Deskjet 610cl Back in Aug-99 its now Nov and my printer wont work ive checked out the Hp's forum and the entire thing is full of complaints about the 610s and 612s models. Ive always liked and recommended Hps i see this as a BIG stain on hps reputation. I highly recommend not buying the 610s or the 612s
1,"had it for 2 months ,now it dosn't work,less than 50 copies","I purchased this product ( a Hewlett Pacard 610cl), in August of 1999. It is now Oct.1999. I have printed less than fifty copies with my "" NEW "" printer and now it doesn't work.It is possible that maybe I have the one, ""lemon"" in the bunch, but it is still disappointing to see a strong name like H.P. have a product that could die before the first ink cartridge did. Personally I would not recomend this to anyone ( unless I didn't like them ). I have gone back to my Old Epson---maybe not the print quality I want, But it's reliable."
1,HP Deskjet 693C,"I purchesed one and have the same problem. The thing clicks and bangs when it prints ""If it does"" and when it does the print quality is low. When it prints it drags all over the place and i get lines of ink through my text. Its not worth it to buy 1. If you want a real print the hp 880's are excellent and they work great under mass use."
3,Not THAT bad,"I am a very loyal HP printer customer. I recently got a 610CL ""free"" with the purchase of my new computer. My older HP printer, the discontinued 820cse, is now hooked up to my new computer, and the ""free"" one went to son with the old computer. Although I wouldn't personally use the 610, for my son it is working perfectly fine. The quality is decent for an elementary school kid, and although very noisy, it has worked perfectly. I wouldn't buy it for a primary printer unless you're really low in cash, but for for an older computer or a child, it is perfectly fine."
3,Deskjet 610CL isn't at all bad for 20 year old technology.,"I have used this printer since 1999, and it has given excellent service. BUT IT IS OLD. Granted, it makes noise, the cartridges are expensive and hard to find. BUT what do you expect? This is NOT a new printer. Its technology is 19 years out of date. But the cartridges aren't chipped as many new ink jet printers are. You can use generic ink cartridges if you like and you can refill them if you want to risk the mess. I'll keep using it until it quits. Then I'll replace it."
3,So far so good,The HP 610cl is my first printer... it was a gift. I've ran 2 copies so far and haven't had any problems yet. If the same holds true I'll be looking for a new one come the end of February.Maybe HP ought to have a recall the same way GM has with all its vehicles.
3,Loaded with inaccuraccies,"Well-intentioned with some engaging characters, but the level of research in an historical novel exploring different cultures is very poor. The most significant errors are in the author's understanding of First Nations cultures. He seems confused between Haida and Tsimshian (they are very distinct) and puts forward some absurd notions. eg. ""Both the Tsimshian and Haida believe in many things. [well, who doesn't] When a Tsimshian dies, if he's led a good life, he comes back to earth as an eagle or a raven or another one of the creatures of the forest or ocean."" This is simply preposterous and an insult to Tsimshian people by its ignorance. One more laughable example: Quite a bit is made of the main character hunting rabbits. Well, if the author had done a modicum of research he would have found that rabbits do not exist on the north coast, and that the hunting scenes in the book would have been impossible."
5,O Melhor single de Trance,"Vale a pena comprar esse single,os novos remixes dele so ducaralho.Vale a pena mesmo..."
5,An Ordinary-Dysfunctional American Family,"This book is a testament to the uniqueness and isolation of each ""ordinary"" American family. The author perfectly captures the claustrophobia of a dysfunctional family. The whole family seems trapped in a childlike powerlessness to change their destinies or control events;you forgive the children, you have difficulty forgiving the parents. World War II seems a small thing in comparison to the larger war on Collins Drive."
5,My Fathers War,"For the sons and daughters of WW II combat veterans this book is a must read. The author vividly details the pain and suffering many combat veterans' lived with through out their lives, and the effects on their families. In her writing you can see how the sufferings of some of these veterans' struggle with until death; witch was their only relief.Ms Collins and I have a few things in common. Both are Grandfathers were close friends. They both were businessmen on Main St in the center of Branford CT, and had sons over seas in the Marine Corps. They spent many hours comforting each other that their sons would survive the way and return home safely to Branford. In fact my family celebrated VJ day at the Collin's home in Pine Orchard."
5,No Prisoners Taken,"Without 20:20 hindsight or wishful thinking, Julia Collins has written a graceful and moving work that stares straight into the failings of her father as a war hero, breadwinner and parent and somehow manages to elevate and dignify the person her dad was. This challenge made all the more difficult by requiring Jerry Collins to pose for a portrait that in life, he would never have held. “My Father’s War” is not the retelling of one ex-Marine’s pointless miseries but wisdom collected from the perspective of the point-blank battles that raged on the homefront long after the formal surrender of any proclaimed American enemy."
4,nice tie a little short,"Nice tie but it is a little short. I have a big neck > 19"" so it may just be me! Tie holds it shape."
1,Head Vases,"It was an out dated book, therefore the price guide was useless in determining the current values of the items."
2,Nice pictures but difficult to find a specific head vase.,The pictures were very nice but it is not easy to find your head vase by maker or number; you have to look through entire book. Not all makers represented. Disappointed overall.
3,Head Vase guide missing something,"Has beautiful color pictures and information. Also many different 'odd' head vases I have not seen in other books. I found it rather difficult to find what you are looking for though, as you have to thumb through the entire book. Would have been more helpful to have the identification numbers of each head vase listed in index style with page reference, as other books of this type have. There is no index of any kind, and 'categories' are very vague."
3,Reissue of selections from early Meyerbeer,"This CD is a compilation of selections from Opera Rara's complete recording of Il Crociato (several tracks) and the 1811-1820 and 1821-1830 volumes in the `100 Years of Italian Opera' series. As a survey of all six of Meyerbeer's early operas written in Italy, it is unique in the catalogue. But really at full-price it was an unfortunate decision to cut the texts and translations. Given that these are not Meyerbeer's best works, something for specialist collectors only."
4,"It's doesn't just review VINYL, you goofballs","""Record Guide"" is simply the title. as in Album, Record, Recording, etc. it's not the format that is covered. they're ALL records. I'm sure there are better jazz and blues guides out there, but this one does a very good job of going over many of the essential jazz CD's. definitely worth finding if you can get ahold of a copy. covers all eras of jazz and blues."
2,Not a book for the true carnie,"I was intrigued by the title of this book and had heard good things about it. However, being a true carnival worker myself, the life depicted in the book is not even close to the life of a real carnival con artist. For 12 years I have worked at the guess your weight booth at a traveling carnival. Let me tell you it is no easy life, nor is it glamorous and sexy as this book would have you believe. Also, people eat really fatty foods when they come to the carnival and that makes my job so very difficult. You may enjoy this book, but if you have friends who are real carnies, tell them they are better off spending their money at their own carnival and winning a goldfish that will die within a week. That will be more exciting than this book. Then again, since I don't read very well, I did have someone read it out loud to me so I hope they were really reading what was on the page and not making things up as they went along."
5,Super funny and fun read.,I loved this book. I laughed out loud quite often at the situations and shenanigans those two boys got into. A lot of carney talk and authentic mid-way 'education'.
3,When My Spirit Starts to Flee,"Cindy Woolf's music has an old-timey charm similar to artists like Adie Grey, Gillian Welch or Iris DeMent. Ten tracks were written by Woolf. Her sound is soft & slow. Her voice is as unvarnished as The Little Brown Church. While DeMent grips me with her amazing songwriting, Woolf's is plodding most of the time as on the highly repetitive ""On the Floor of the Sea."" Even when she sounds pretty good as on the lovely ""Cloudy Head,"" the melodies sound like you've heard them before. ""Nobody's Wife"" is a very good track that has some pep and an intriguing chorus, ""Jesus hold me; When my spirit starts to flee, lift my poor soul to your side."" George Jones wrote ""You Done Me Wrong,"" which sounds pleasant. Songs like ""First Impressions,"" ""Fun for a Few Days,"" ""In the Attic,"" ""January"" & the title track would work well for naptime. The musicianship is excellent; Woolf's voice is pleasant, but the songwriting makes ""Simple & Few"" easy to forget. Enjoy!"
4,Excellent Learning Tool,"I am thoroughly impressed with the ""Baby Road Trip"" series...and so is my 23 month old. She started watching this series when she was 18 months old and she can count, knows shapes, colors, and words for things I didn't think was possible for a 1 year old. We have the whole series and her favorite is ""City"" and ""Circus."" It's even fun for parents to watch now and again. It has alot of variety and isn't too ""ADD."" And the price is right!! Thank you amazon!!"
4,Griffin as a historical novelist,"Griffin has created an action filled and entertaining story against some of the darkest days in the history of this country. His main characters are products of the novel and he strives to keep this obvious. However, the surrounding details of his research and their presentation is most unique in that his facts are very often dead bang on target and demonstrate an understanding of the times and the interaction of the personalities of senior officers in the naval service.This book is strongly recommended to those who want to get a feeling for these most trying times."
5,"Great condition, and quality...","I ordered this book used, and it was listed as acceptable quality, but I received a book it almost new quality. The only damage was the paper cover protector was tore a little bit. The book itself is in great condition, and I am excited to read through it. I've read the previous books in the series, and absolutely love them, I can't imagine WEB Griffin did himself any injustice in these three books. Will update after I read through the books. Definately recommend WEB Griffin to any WWII buff, war/spy novel enthusiasts, and anyone who just likes extended book series with extremely interesting, suspenseful, and gripping storytelling."
3,Get the facts straight,"I am a bit late in reading W.E Griffen ---particularly ""Close Combat"" and "" Honor Bound "" I am aware these are works of fiction BUT there are MAJOR differences between a P-40 and a P-39 maybe I could help you guys edit //review other works of fictionilization vs factualization of this Genrephotonxc@aol.com Richard"
5,A variety of characters tugging at your emotions,"The fictional story of human and alien relationships seems far fetched at first, but what a ride you take when you delve into this book. It's a saga that doesn't want to end. There is a hunger to finish what is started. I'd like to say this is a book for everyone, but it is not. It is an adult book with adult emotions. There is a dare to understand the characters and their language. They are full of fun and excitement and a lust for romantic adventure. Put it down before you are through and you'll be dreaming about the potential events that could occur. There has never been anything like this book. Some parts describe information that you may not be aware of. You may think some of this fiction could be actually true, or was it imagination? Easy to read and worth the price."
5,"Their hearts are locked, their souls entwined...","And their love is dangerous! ""Chasing The Cosmic Wind"" is a thought-provoking, extraordinary love story laced with humor, action and government cover-up. Be prepared to laugh and to cry as you read about what happens when the alien known as Vogarr invades the body of a beautiful earthling with red hair named Karen. From the first page to the last you will think and dream about the Cosmic Wind. You'll wish you could experience it yourself. And when you're finished, you'll want more!"
5,I'm AMAZED!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this set of dvd's for Gastro Intestinal/Depression a few weeks ago. They are absolutely amazing. The postures have really helped improve the chronic stomache problems which I have had for years.I can't begin to say how thankful I am!!!!!!!!!I recommend these dvd's to everyone, they will change your life."
4,Nice sequence of postures with excellent pacing,"This is a simple, easy to follow yoga routine. There are a lot of relaxation poses integrated in the workout, so one doesn't get too tired...nevertheless, one does get a workout!, especially on the abdominals. Unlike a lot of high speed/flow yoga DVDs, this one really gives you the time to get into the pose, feel its effect and move out of it mindfully. I give the instructor an A+ for her pacing/timing. The only drawback? her English!!! A lot of words are mispronounced...'internal massage' sounds like ""internet message""...touch your 'ankles""/uncles, etc. This being said, this DVD is really well done and I am sure that I will use it repeatedly."
3,"Nice Video, But I prefer a flow class","I'm used to yoga flow classes - hatha yoga, and this was a unique experience. Each pose is held only once through the whole hour. Not exactly the style I'm used to, but I think it's nice to try out different things.I wish I had an easier time understanding the instructors accent.I'm so happy Amazon has free yoga instruction for prime members."
3,Same as my other review this series,"Same set, same problems with voice, acoustics, and soundtrack.3 stars for being traditional yoga by traditionalist yogi.but i can't take that music this time of day. i did not watch all of this one."
1,Cut-Off Tool,"The wrong tool was shipped to us, because the wrong picture was in the Amazon.com site. This was not the tool we wanted. We returned the tool and received notification of credit granted, but have not received any refund as yet."
4,This Saw Met My Needs.,"I have had this saw for over a year and it worked well for what I needed it for. The blade cuts smoothly and does not ruin the edges. As some have noted, the table is not smooth, but that did not affect my cuts. I will say that the sawdust bag does not work all that well. Most of the sawdust never makes it to the bag, so I recommend that you use this outside. It does fold down for easy storage and transport. I am looking forward to using on much larger projects..."
5,Honest Seller,This seller sold me this LS 120 and I had no problems and it was in excellent condition!
1,You've got to be kidding.,"After reading only a few of the fourteen selections, I would like to (for the first time) return a book due to sheer lack of quality. I can't even find the effort to pick up this book and give it another try."
3,Have a paper bag handy,"I must admit that this book is very well written. Yet, as the story continues to unfold, Naomi's manipulative, promiscuous treachery and Joji's dwindled assertion has you gagging and wretching to the end; you learn to hate them both!"
3,The Hardy Boys for adults.,"Ambrose Bierce is a cynical writer for the San Francisco Examiner who likes to investigate mysteries. In this story, set in 1891, he delves into the murder of a notorious British yachtsman who is luring young ladies to his boat. The story is told from the perspective of his fellow reporter and side-kick, Tom Redmond, who falls in love with the mysterious Eliza Lindley, which is half the story. Bierce is also smitten by another reporter. The book is mildly amusing and a quick, easy read, but not memorable and therefore hard to recommend."
2,false advertising,The plot is predictable; the setting ill-developed; and the characters are shallow. The novel could have been as easily set in the LA of the 1930s as SF of the 1890s. Each chapter is preceded by an entry from the Devil's Dictionary the relevance of which for any given chapter is often problematic. What really rankles me is that although Ambrose Bierce is featured in the title he is a VERY minor character in the novel coming across as a somewhat cynical middle aged de facto bachelor smitten by a rather supercilious newspaperwoman. On the positive side the novel is short and not demanding--a perfect soporific.
3,Difficult setup,"I had great difficulty setting up the parameters for AT&T wireless, very frustrating. Now that it is configured it has been working fine. The distance is a little short though."
1,Absolute P.O.S,Absolute P.O.S ... got it connected to my computer and set it up. Unfortunately it wouldnt connect to my Belkin Wireless router. Kept saying 0% signal and it was only about 10 feet away with nothing in the way. So i put it right next to it....still no signal....finally connected for a moment but kept disconnecting and stated only a weak signal even though it was right next to the wireless router. Tried updating firmware but nothing...read that it has issues with WPA and im not going to turn that off so its going back.
1,Does not work with DGL-4300 with latest firmware.,"I picked this up on sale to use as a bridge from the garage to my D-Link DGL-4300. With the latest firmware on the 4300 (1.8) the 3420 will not connect in WPA mode, all it does is reboot every 20 seconds. D-Link supports answer was to either select WEP mode or downgrade the firmware in the 4300 to version 1.6. also the interface on the 3420 is not compatible with Firefox, you have to use IE to configure."
4,"It works, and thats what matters",Its smiple and thats what make it work well.Plug it in and set it up and forget.Very easy to use.
2,Only for those with D-Link routers,"If your router is not by D-Link, and particularly if you use WPA encryption with that router, do not purchase the DGL-3420. I have tested it with both the Linksys WRT54G and the SMC 2804WMBP-G, and WPA fails with both of them. D-Link technical support, in fact, has confirmed that THEY know the adapter doesn't work using WPA with the WRT54G.Besides, for significantly less money you can get a wireless bridge with a lot more functionality. After this product failed for me, I purchased the Netgear WGPS606, which can connect FOUR items (X-Box, computer, whatever) to your wireless network AND two wireless print servers, all for $20 less (on Amazon)."
4,T4 fluorescent tube,"I was happy that Amazon was able to ship this item quickly and safely, (Think about it: a light bulb by mail.) since I had not been able to find it at any local suppliers (Lowe's, Home Depot, Lamps Plus). Unfortunately, it turned out that the problem was the lamp itself, and I had to dispose of the entire unit and get a new LED spot lamp for use in my kitchen."
4,A Great Power Ballad,"This song caught me by surprise. The pop remix sounds like it could have been recorded by one of the great early 90's pop metal bands. All that is missing is a killer guitar solo in the middle. I still have not decided whether the song would have sounded better with John Waite (Bad English) singing lead. Nevertheless, if you enjoy huge power ballads in the vain of Bad English or Damn Yankees, then the pop version of ""Amazed"" by Lonestar is a good choice. It certainly is nice to hear this type of music again."
2,Unfortunately legalistic,"Unfortunately this book is to the extreme even for the fundamentalist. Better books on the subject would be _Heart Disease in Christ's Body_ by Jack VanImpe and _Witchunt_ by the Passantino family. Pickering basically takes ""coming out and being separate"" to a form of protestant monasticism where you only hang out with folk who so totally agree with you that it not longer becomes about Jesus Christ, but about all the peripheral subjects."
4,Nothing special,"I bought this book for a Social Studies teaching class. This was the only mandatory book. Other students have found the material to be dense and information packed. I do not. I find it to be a standard MODERN book on teaching methodology. It gives some good ideas, but nothing out of the ordinary. All in all, it delivers what it promises."
2,Yu-Gi-Oh!!!!!!!!!!,"Well, as you can see, I didn't find this cardholder extremely educational but it would be very functional if I owned Yu-Gi-Oh cards, that much I can see for sure. So, for the most part I would def. recommend these if you are worried about bending your cards or sullying them or even losing track off them."
3,nothing crazy,just some exercise and various techniques. Advanced and will not improve your playing right away. Great for Satriani guitar playing fans. Once again some advanced exercises.
5,Useful Shortcuts to essential guitar knowledge,"I have been looking for books dealing with Joe Satriani guitar technique for some time, and not really technique, but essential guitar knowledge that can be applied to any style. Speed, coordination, and theory all exist in this collection of magazine excerpts. Awesome shiz-nit."
2,not what i expected,"when i looked over this book i was dissapointed. it is too short and i found most everything to be confusing and boring. there were no examples to help you understand and the explainations were not clear. I do not reccommend this book, instead check out Metal Lead Guitar by Troy Stetina, that book is alot better"
2,not too good,"I didnt really care for this book. I am a big fan of Joe's but this book didnt help me or appeal to me. Its first of all, too short, and it is more for advanced guitarists."
2,"Good book for beginners, but certainly no ""secrets""","I was disappointed by this book. He covers some scales, modes and exercises which may be beneficial for beginners who are learning to play some solos, but there's really no ""guitar secrets"" in this book. I would not recommend this for an intermediate or advanced player."
4,Short lessons to expand musical knowledge & creativity,"Short lessons compilation from Guitar For The Practicing Musician magazine published in 1987-1990.An interesting book plenty of ideas for expanding your musical knowledge and creativity but not a virtuoso technique book. It's approached to experiment by yourself applying the concepts explained. Many lessons don't contain examples. So don't expect to find a lot of speed, arpeggio or scale exercises as it is not that kind of book. Notice that it is not a guitar method.Probably many musicians already know much of what is shown here but they'll surely learn some useful ideas or work in what they already know but they haven't cared of.The table of contents is well structured but lessons are ordered chronologically which makes it less comfortable."
3,Hard lessons,"Joe Satriani is undoubtedly one of the greatest guitar players of our time, that said this book is useful yet a bit hard to get into. First of all, it consists of 40+ lessons which sounds nice, but in reality each lesson is not much more than a small blurb. The lessons are, after all, a compilation of columns that Joe wrote for a guitar magazine so they are very brief. Joe focuses very much on guitar theory and emphasizes memorization of modes and scales and memorizing the fretboard in general. I found myself reading an article, then working on the lesson for days (even months) trying to memorize different things, and it ended up feeling kind of like work instead of fun which defeats the purpose if you ask me.Bottom line: Good insight, poor delivery."
1,read the fine print,"Beware the stated capacity of pint jars. The fine print says they are based on standard mouth jars. Had I read that I would not have purchased this. Instead of the advertised 7 jars, if you use wide-mouth (which everyone I know does) it holds only five. Nowhere is the capacity for wide-mouth jars stated, not even in the manual.Good advertising gives the purchased all the information they need, not just what works to the advantage of the seller, even if it is ""the truth."" One star."
2,Multivariate data analysis without equations. Not practical.,"I have some mathematical background and a very basic statistical formation (undergrad class). I bought this book because I needed to actually do some multivariate data analysis, but I obviously bought the wrong book. For starters... the book doesn't have any equations! There are hundreds of pages of prose used to explain concepts that could have been summarized with simple formulas. This is a good book if you are interested in getting an idea of how statisticians or scientist analyze complex data sets, but I doubt it will help you to really understand the techniques, and let alone, implement them. If you are interested in actually using MVDA, then don't waste your money on this book and buy Johnson and Wichern's book instead."
5,"Alas, I understand the application of statistics.",The book helped me get through the different statistical options for my dissertation- and understand them!
5,Evening with the Greats,"A terrific opportunity to see numerous blues greats organized by an energetic and cheerful John Mayall. Super playing and teamwork, a fantastic buy at this price; real piece of history."
3,Brit Blues takes the honours,"John Mayall and his band do the usual homage to black US blues and blues artists in the usual self-deprecating, ingratiating way. However in a mixed bag of guest performances, Etta James and Sippy Wallace are mediocre/poor respectively (ok sippy was 80+, but Etta James poor choice of material), Albert King is very good but Mick Taylor absolutely blows him and Buddy Guy away and is probably by far the best guitarist on stage. In fact he appears to be holding back. Its about time Brit guitarists, while acknowledging their contributions to the Blues, stopped overrating and sucking up to the Albert Kings, Albert Collins and Buddy Guys of the world."
5,Classic Crooner,"This CD is essential for any Dick Haymes fan. It contains the original recordings of his most famous Decca tunes (with a few from his tenure with Capitol), featuring duets with Helen Forrest."
4,Hard to put this book down,Good read. Interesting story line. Thought I was going to be disappointed. When reading overlook the grammatical errors.
3,Somwhat Entertaining If You Can Suspend Disbelief,"The ""mystery"" of the story, and the coincidences are absolutely ridiculous and laughable. With that said, I did find it somewhat entertaining once I suspended disbelief! The sex scenes were the only believable aspects of this book! I'm not recommending it."
2,Change The Cover,"I probably would have rated the book with just one more star if the cover wasn't so ridiculous. The story was rather boring and the characters uninteresting. Half way through, I actually didn't care what happened to them and I struggled to get through it. The sex scenes had more detail than the actual story. I am beginning to believe what they say about if they have to put a gorgeous hunk on the front, usually that is as good as it gets."
3,Afterlife Experiments,"It was interesting to see clips from some of the experiments I've read about. As a paranormal researcher, I was also interested to see how others (historically) approached research. It was interesting but not overly stimulating; you really can learn from others' mistakes."
3,Quick Delivery,"This speaker pillow got here pretty quick. It seems to work well, but it was alot smaller than I thought it would be, but that's my fault for not checking out the size a little more. My daughter was pleased, and that's all that really matters."
3,Needed detailed pressure transducer info,"I bought this for the pressure section. I needed mechanical / manufacturing detail on a piezoresistive diaphragm type, but it wasn't detailed enough for my needs. I haven't found a book that is new within the last 15 years, and has more than 10 pages on pressure sensors. For a general sensor book, it is modern and seems like it will be a useful reference."
2,"Poor design. Too big, Too Loose, Too bad...","I've owned the Rio 500 and I liked it. If you MUST own a RIO get a 500 atleast you can use smart media cards. Its bad enough that the 600 uses a RIO only method for expanding storage, but the design of such is bad. They had to put a weird plastic peice of junk around the battery. The pins are very easily bent or broken when reloading batteries or upgrading the back panel. The device is physically larger than it should be, and it is made of the WORST plastic possible. A soft compound that would not be durable. OVERALL BAD PRODUCT. PLEASE SHOP AROUND. AND CHECK OUT REVIEWS. DIAMOND gets what they deserve for letting this peice of junk make it all the way to market."
1,Get a MINI DISC PLAYER,"My Friend has an MP3 player and I have a MiniDisc player. We both agree I made the better choice.MP3s are smaller, but Mini Disc players can fit in any pocket and weigh less than a pound. I can carry my Mini Disc player and a few extra discs in my front pocket (up to 5 hours), but I rarely have that much.MP3s have limited space (32MB=about 32 Minutes @ 128KPS). To expand this you can buy a $90 memory disc for some MP3s. A 74 minute Mini Disc is $1.50-$2 each. I have tranfered many full CDs (mine and my friends')to MD. I have SNL skits, live preformances, voice recordings, songs by genre and artist and also full CDs all on assorted Mini DiscsMP3s can only get songs from a computer. MDs can get any audio from anything with an audio line out (all computers and most CD players, TVs, VCRs, DVD players, and others.MINI DISC IS BETTER"
3,"Nice, but buggy...","I have enjoyed this product for a few days now. It has it's problems. 1) It ships with software that isn't a full version. 2) It is buggy as hell (the Rio software, not the bundled software). downloading often fails, fast forward will jam the machine (have to pull the battery pack off to reset it), tunes often have loud pops and noises at the end of them, and tunes often get skipped before their ends are reached. 3) 32MB is goofy. 64MB is useful, 32MB is too small.On the good side, it works well, (as soon as you throw away the garbage earphones), USB works well (when it works), sound quality is acceptable for active use."
1,I reluctantly give it one star...,"The first Rio I bought was easy to use and pretty quick. Fun stuff! When I went running (the indicator said 78% battery power), it suddenly indicated 0% power and shut off. I changed the battery and yet, the darn thing kept shutting off. Tech support was really unhelpful. They recommended I upload the firmware. This did not help. Frustrated, I reasoned that I probably just got a lemon. So I exchanged it. For another lemon. The new one distorted the sound (sounded like a tape being chewed up) and eventually stopped playing. After that horrendous experience, I returned it and shelled out double the money for an Intel Pocket Concert. It just seems sturdier. Equally easy to use -- more memory. And it works like a dream!! Completely worth the extra cash!! Save yourselves, people!!"
1,"Rollercoaster of Emotions. Good, Static, Won't Stay On","I got the Rio 600 for my girlfriend for valentine's day. She really wanted an MP3 player she could use at school. At first the Rio 600 was great, it took her alittle while to get use to the software but that was fine. Then all it did was play static. Now it won't stay on for more than a few seconds. A real piece of ... and I'm stuck looking like a jerk, because this thing doesn't work and trying to reach Diamond about the issue is like trying to get blood from a stone. Buy something else. A few weeks later my cousin bought the same unit, and he is experiencing the same problems."
1,Serious technical problems,"I've been through 5 Rio600s already, and each one of them has had the same problem, after about 2 weeks the unit suddenly stops functioning. All the unit produces is static. You can barely hear the music if you turn the volume up to about three times normal, but it's barely recognizable. Diamond has replaced each unit, sending a packing slip every, but each time I talk to tech support they say it's the first time they've heard of this problem, even though I've heard similar stories from other people.I'm trying to compile a list of people who've encountered the same issue, that that this problem may be made public. If you've experienced this defect in the Diamond Rio600 MP3 player, or think you have, please email me at grahamdrew@yahoo.com."
1,"Maybe I'm Unlucky, But...","I was very happy with my PMP300, which I bought the week they were released, but I wanted to upgrade to USB and WMA format capability. So I bought a 600 at Best Buy.The FIRST unit kept turning itself off after a few seconds. Oh well, I thought, a rare dud, and I took it back the same day for a replacement.The SECOND was better. Not only wouldn't it play, my hand immediately detected intense heat. I opened it up and the battery was redhot. I made certain I had it in the right direction, which it was. Then I tried a new battery and again it turned redhot in 30 seconds. Needless to say, I took it back the smae day, and gave up!I just bought a Compaq iPaq (USB, WMA compatible, 64Megs) and it works great, looks great, is the size of a pager, and appears to be much more durable than other players."
2,Great at first....,"I received this as a Holiday gift recently and initially was very impressed. Cool design, and easy to install and use software. Music capacity is defintely skimpy, however. MP3 format takes up much more memory than WMA format, so it helps to search for music in WMA format. Even more helpful would be the upgrade, and frankly they should make it with the higher memory to start. Out of the box I would say the memory capacity can sometimes be closer to 30 minutes than 60 minutes. Biggest problem: after only a couple of weeks of using it, it died. No warning, it wasn't dropped. Everything appears to be fine except that no sound comes out of it. Tech support was very matter-of-fact about the problem as if it happened all the time and said they would authorize a replacement, though I have yet to get the paperwork that will allow me to send it back. Bottom line seems to be: good product with quality control problems!"
2,Static Player Too,I purchased two RIO 600's for my kids (Christmas). At first I was impressed with the intuitive software and sound quality of the player. THEN.. after 4 days my son's RIO audio output became all static. I tried different headphones and re-loading the playlist with no luck. I took it back and the replacement has now started the same symptoms. I am giving up on RIO!
3,Static Player,"Sure the Rio600 is pretty cool and can play digital music but I think that Rio should still be de bugging it. When I first got it for chrismas it worked perfectly and I thought it was the coolest thing. 3 days later all im hearing is static that sounds like the beat of the music. Obiously its defective, so I'm sending it back. Another thing that was wierd was that each time I set my clock it always went back to the time it came with and even if the thing had no music in it, it still says it takes up space. What really stinks is that it can only really play up to 9 MP3 songs! I hope they send me a better one."
4,You get what you get and you dont throw a fit.,"This is a great little guy for taking a single disk on the road with you when you travel, work out or mow the lawn. I was not looking for a place to store my complete music collection, just something to use while waiting at the barber shop, doctor, oil change etc. This works perfectly.If you upgrade to the latest version of Windows Media Player you can interface directly with this unit and not have to be bothered with additional software. Using the WMA format it sounds just fine.It is not easily expanded, but if that is what you are after get a mini-disc so that expansion is as simple as buying additional, low cost, discs."
2,MP3 Players Are Great...Just Not This One!,"I got this player as a gift and was SO excited about it. I read some bad reviews and went, ""whatever."" MY personal experience was that it was a really good player at the beginning, good software [once I figured out how to use it...took me awhile as I'm not very technically inclined], and looked great. Then, the buttons got really hard to push/broke entirely...fast forward to now: it's practically un-usable. The thing sits on my bookshelf 24/7/365...which stinks. What ticks me off worse is that I wrote various e-mails to the company about a replacement or refund and received really stinky customer service e-mails back...vague and super unhelpful. The player also eats up the AA batteries pretty fast. I really don't recommend this player...don't get me wrong...buy an MP3 player [the idea rocks!] but make sure you get one from a more reliable company and one that got better Amazon.com reviews!"
4,Good player,"A lot of people are having problems with downloading songs to the Rio 600 but in the book it says that if you are having problems you should go to the Options and change the Device to Rio 600. Sometimes it works without this but if you do it, it should work no matter what. I have had a few problems but i think that most of you people are just idiots and don't know how to use the Rio 600. It works great.Also, whoever said that they had one that came without a case and they think it was previously returned, you are an idiot. At first they were released with no case and 1.01 firmware. Then when they release it with 1.15 firmware, it had a case. The case is only in the one with 1.15 or greater firmware. I've returned my Rio 5 times and the one with the new firmware and case is much better and possibly completely bug free."
5,very good product with 64MB,"I have the Rio 600 and bought the 32MB backpack, so I have 64MB. In WMA 64bps (that still gives me a great sound) I can store up to 30 songs, also the reachargable battery is a nice feature with the 32MB backpack. Installation on my win98SE PC also worked fine. What is also very nice is the download speed, compared with my old Rio 300 this is ingreadible fast."
1,"Maybe I'm Just Unlucky, But...","I bought a 600 at Best Buy and it kept turning itself off. I tried a new battery, but it still malfunctioned. I figured it was a rare dud (my PMP300 worked perfectly) and I took it back for a replacement.The SECOND unit was even better. Not only didn't it work, I felt heat while holding it and poened it up to discover a red-hot battery. I made certain it was in the right direction and tried another battery. Same problem, so I returned it and gave up.I just bought a Compaq iPaq ---the size of a pager, USB, 64 Megs---and it works great."
4,"Great Player, but it has a problem.","I just got the Rio 600, and it is great. It transfers files quickly and plays them perfectly.I like all of the features, especially the cool display and menus. The only problem I'm having is that the circular button combo thing is always jammed. The Play/Pause button, the rewind button, and the stop button have worked fine, but the fast forward/next track button doesn't work right. It somehow makes the songs Play or Pause too.That really doesn't matter though because the remote control will replace all the buttons and it should be fine."
3,S3 Rio 600 review,"The Rio 600 is a very good product. It has a low price $169.99, very good sound quality,and, is above all easy to use. I did at first experience a few problems with the whole song not playing, but after a few painless calls to service and support, all the problems were fixed. The software is fairly easy to use and because of the USB connectivity, downloads only take a few seconds. You can also swap the blue faceplate for other faceplates that are available at riostuff.com. This player is definitely a fashion statement. The reason I'm giving this player 3 stars is it's meager on-board memory. There are memory back packs available to boost it's on-board memory,but it would have been a lot easier if it just supported Compact Flash cards. But, if its combination of low price, stylishness, and ease of use has won you over, just use WMA files like Drew said to compensate for its slightly lacking memory."
2,LASTED ABOUT A WEEK!,"I wish I had waited and read the reviews earlier as I too, would NOT have purchased this item. It's a roll of the dice from what I've read. You might wind up with a Rio 600 that functions for you at the level expected. Or you might not. It may last a few days, or as in my case a bit over one week! The sound quality went from really great to TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE! The Joy pad does not function well at all. Sometimes not taking input at all, sometimes responding with wrong results. I would consider this item's quality control to be non-existant."
3,Don't replace those headphones just yet,"After reading the online and print pans of the Rio 600's headphones, I ordered a pair of Sennheiser MX-3's when I ordered my Rio. I found the standard 600 headphones to be excellent. The Sennheisers offer slightly better bass but were much more uncomfortable to wear. I ditched the Sennheisers and am sticking with the stock earbuds. My only complaint with the 600 is its tendency to spontaneously advance to the next song in mid-recording--very annoying. I'm sending mine back for a replacement."
1,Buggy,"I bought this product from a local Best Buy store and experianced nothing but trouble from both the product and the Best Buy store. I was one of the people that suffered from the USB bug and contacted Tech Support from Diamond. They were very unhelpful and ran me around the bush when it came to getting a fix for the bug ""it will be out in a day or two"" (two weeks later still no fix).I tired then to return the product to Best Buy but since they have a very poor 30 day return policy were unwilling to help me out (i returned it 5 days over their 30 day agreement) I even showed them pages and pages of email between myself and Diamond. Needless to say do not shop at Best Buy beacuse they are unwilling to do that little extra for the customer.On a positive note, Diamond was willing to refund the purchase price of my unit without any problems. Maybe Best Buy should learn from them."
4,Great for audio books!,I use the rio 600 to listen to audio books that I download from audible.com. It works well for this purpose. My main complaint is that I can't get the volume loud enough for situations where there is a lot of fairly loud background noise (e.g. traffic on a busy street).
2,Poor Software and Customer support,"I wish I could tell you how this product performs. Unfortunately the software, real Jukebox that comes with it or the Windows Media player intermittingly does not recognize the device. It took me several hours to figure out how to load songs onto the device. The Real Jukebox software is very intrusive, loading many things onto your computer. When I tried updating the software, it would only give me a 14-day trial to the new software and asked me for a credit card. I am a literate computer user and fond this device to be very difficult to load songs. Customer support give you the wrong email address and cannot forward you email to the proper division."
2,"Nice, but reliability problems","I had a problem from the day I bought it, when the battery gets to about 60% power, the player would restart when pressing the play button. Happens every time when this situation exists. I have sent a couple of e-mails to the company asking how I can get the player fixed, but no reply yet after about a week. I am quite unhappy because of the product being defective out of the box.Not counting the reliability problems, it seems like a nice player, but 32meg is not enough. I cannot put one album on the player at higher quality levels."
2,"spend more, get more","POS. Pause is a joke with this thing. 75 percent of the time pausing just gets you back to the beginning of the file. Also once the battery is down to 50 percent it just shuts off.I notice the used price keeps dropping. Once it gets to ""free"" I might suggest it as something good for throwning."
3,Not Rio's best offering,"The 600, and it's big sister the 800, may be sturdier than the 300 and 500, but are otherwise inferior products. The backpacks (as opposed to the cards used by most other players) are expensive and bulky, and the whole is just plain ugly. There's no point to the ridiculous snap-on snap-off face plates that can be bought for the Rio 600. Also, I've found that a small but sturdy (attached)belt clip is more convenient than the little bag that comes with the Rio 600. What in the world were the manufacturers thinking? Who in the world did they think they were marketing this thing to?"
2,satisfied but,"I like it a lot, it dos not bother me that it only holds 6 to 8 snngs , but i cant seam to get any length of play time out of my batteries if i let it sit for a few days without use the battery goes dead."
3,The Rio 600 is good but the program stinks,"When i was givin my rio i was really excited. I opened it and quickly download songs onto it from ""NAPSTER"". As soon as the songs were downloaded i started to listen. I had the same songs on it for a few weeks so i decided to change them. As soon as the songs were done i listened and ALL OF THE SONGS had big skips. i was really P/O so i tryed it again. This time half of the songs didn't even download and the ones that did had skips. Theats when i decided to reinstall it. when i reinstalled it, it wouldn't install. It came up with an error message saying that the cd was not working. so i checked for a scratch and there wasn't one. So now i am going to call rio and ask for a refund."
1,The third time's the charm?,"My pre-teen son saved his money for quite some time to be able to buy himself an MP-3 player. He bought an open box Rio 600 the first time,(saved $25) and it never worked for more than 1 hour. There was either no sound or alot of crackling/popping sounds. Thinking that it was due to the open box or the headphones, we returned it and were able to exchange it for a new Rio 600 (and he bought new headphones). This one had the identical problems as well as a great deal of trouble turning off and on. Once again, we returned it. We decided that this couldn't possibly happen again, and tried one last time. Although, the power switch seemed lose,it worked for about a month, then the switch completely broke (you can hear the plastic rattling around inside). Tech support has been NO help at all, and my son has learned an important but expensive lesson...stick with a company which will support its products (not Sonicblue)."
1,Flawed Design - Beware!,"I've been through three of these little suckers in six weeks! All broke in exactly the same way: the on/off switch drops out, and eventually the unit won't power up. Despite the fact that Amazon and Rio have been great about shipping replacements, this is an essentially flawed product (as corroborated by Rio's customer support - who today offered to ship me unit #4).Look elsewhere!"
2,Non-Existent support from Diamond MM,"I bought a Diamond Rio 500, but since those are not being sold now I thought I should let you know that support for these devices is non-existent from Diamond / SonicBlue. I have still not been able to register the device to unlock its software to allow me to continue making MP3 files from CD. There is no documentation that comes with it, there is virtually no on-line documentation, and there is no technical support. I have gotten three on-line responses so far from people who obviously did not even read my question and problem. The device seems to be working ok so far, but the software to use it and the technical support are garbage."
3,average mp3 player,"Rio 600 32 MB is an average MP3 player.Its got more Cons than Pros!!!Cons:-Rio Audio Manager software is sooo useless, even amateurs can write better software than this.-The buttons(play/pause,stop,next track etc) are soo difficult to use since they dont have the feel of a button at all. They are more like a dial which is really stupid.-Earplugs given with this product is soo stupid and get entangled all the time.Pros:+Low battery consumption(about 9-10Hrs on a single battery)+Windows Media player 9.0 detects this player immediately and is easy to transfer files(takes 10 secs to transfer a song)+Supports WMA (Windows Media Audio) which has better compression at 64kbps.Also I see most people pointing out that 32MB is too low to listen to a lot of songs but thats all you can do when you have a 32 MB player. Its not the fault of RIO mp3 player."
1,Just got one...,"I just bought one of these at a local electronics store. I can't say for the device (since it hasn't worked, yet), but the software is trash. If you get one you should know that you will:a) have to register it with the manufacturer with unique ID codes and your email before it will run. (before that, it will just crash anytime you try to send data to the device. But, SURPRISE, once you register it, it works perfectly! Or, at least, it starts working at all...)b) pay them a monthly fee to use the software. You are allowed a free mode, disabling several features, including storing data on CD's, but to use the rest of the features, you have to pay a monthly [fee]...P>Just keep these things in mind, when you're considering the low upfront price of this device."
3,Be wary of defective players,"If you get one that works, it's great...quick downloads, easy to use, good quality music. However, my first one had TONS of problems (music would ""disappear,"" pushing play would shut the thing off, it would freeze, etc, etc, etc.) If you start noticing problems early on, return it IMMEDIATELY because the problems only get worse. My new one is great...let's just hope I don't have problems down the road."
2,they have been better,"About a month ago, I purchased a Dimond Rio 600 mp3 player. At first, I was very excited about this product, because it is compact, lightweight and sporty. But after using this product I have found several flouts, one thing is the material the manufactures have chosen to use, it might be lightweight but it's too soft to maintain its structure. Sometimes the player would turn off by it self because the battery would separate and loss connection. Also the Rio 600 does not use flash media cards, instead it uses a memory back pack which is not currently sold in stores, and since the only way to upgrade your rio is to buy the back pack from Riohome.com, Rio have managed a system that doesn't allow any competitors to create a similar product which allow them to push up the prices for this memory pack. Currently Rio is developing a new Rio 800, which I hope is better than the 600."
1,Most horrible thing I ever bought,"This was a horrible and udderly usless piece of junk. When I first got mine (the first one i got) it worked for about 3 days. Then it just stopped working and i just heard static when i wanted the song to play. Along with that, the software didn't work (i have a PC). I tried countless times to upgrade on its site, called costumer support(which was very inconsiderate and didn't care if it got fixed or not), and did everything possible to fix it. Then I got another one, thinking this one was just a bad one. I was wrong. Same problems with the software, and it worked for 5 days, then i just got static again.All in all, don't buy this one and get an archos or something (archos work very well.)even if it is a little more money."
2,"Unless you love headaches, go look at another MP3 player","One word sums up this player: unreliable. It is very temperamental. Some days it'll work fine, while others it will just turn off by itself with no provocation. It's not funny when you are in the middle of a song, then having to turn the switch to off and then backs to on, then pressing the fwd button until you reach the point you want. I've only had one problem with a song not downloading properly, so it's not a major problem with my unit. A battery will last a good day, two to three with moderate playtime. However, Rio could've found a better place to put the battery. Every time I replace the battery, I'm afraid of breaking the golden pins on the battery side of the unit. Overall, if you want a really good investment for your dollar, don't buy this product. Go look somewhere else."
1,and got a rio volt,"I bought this 'cool rio' thinking is was going to be the end to my audio needs. I soon learned it was comparable to the title. It coulnd't handle the everyday use. Like say the backpack of a high school student. It broke within a month and rio wouldnt help me out. I'm not even gonna mention 32 mb of storage, and 64 mb upgrages cost as much as a new unit itself. I got smart and trashed that and got a rio volt. best sound investment ever."
1,so far 2 rio600's both trash,"My first rio600 waas improperly put together... The thing is light-weight plastic to begin with, but this one was not sealed properly and the on-hold-off button could just fall out unretained. Back to the store for a replacement.The second one is having all of the problems others have reported: (1) the introduction of painfully loud pops and crackles into the music, and (2) the inability to play MP3 files to completion.Anyone heard anything from S3 about these problems? I sent them a support email from their webpage, but no answer so far...So far this product looks like a rush job to fill the super-low-end market.Others seem to like it, so maybe I've just been unlucky. But the premature song termination problem seems reasonably wide-spread.I recommend buying this one from someplace you won't have any trouble returning it to if you have problems!Marc"
1,"Too many problems!!! The ""Yugo"" of MP3 players!!","This is my first gripe review. The backpack slips off when jogging, working out at the gym, or walking across a room holding it in your hand. The little ""slider"" that switched the player on and off, upload, somehow slipped into the molding. The only way I've been able to turn it on is with a small eyeglass screwdriver. NOW, two days ago, the unit began unexpectedly turning itself off!!Unless your immobile and treat this like its a Tiffany vase, DON'T BUY IT!! I'm already looking for a replacement and never buying anything else from this company, EVER!"
1,Is that the best you can do?,"At first, the Rio 600 seemed like a dream come true. It was very simple to transfer songs from the computer to the device. The only major problem(or so I thought)was that it used up a lot of AA batteries in one week. After about 3 months, I was no longer able to add songs to the Rio library, therefore making it so I could no longer listen to newly downloaded songs, only old ones. I could still transfer songs that I had downloaded before though. About a month later, I was unable to transfer any songs to the device. It said on my computer screen that the songs were being transferred, yet they failed to find their way to my player. Now, the mp3 player won't even turn on. I've tried putting in new batteries, but nothing will get it to turn back on. Too bad there wasn't a four month warranty."
3,Good for the price,"I got this player and I had a few problems so far. The software is a bit buggy but once you get the hang of it it works fine. The fact that it dosent take digital cards but you have to buy a special extra memory pack dose kinda suck, and the player will skip a song if it detects a problem so be sure if your downloading an MP3 its as clean a download as possible it wont except even the slightes corrupted file!"
2,"Decent, but you could buy much better","+'s: small, looks cool, good sound quality-'s: i am running win 98, pII 400, 256 ram... the software (audio manager) which is the only way to transfer music is very buggy, slow, and eats up to many resources (feels like written in JAVA awt). 25% success rate transferring songs over 6 megs. if i turn off the player in the middle of playing a song, the player will not play that song anymore... ie: it will start playing and then 30 sec in it will jump automatically to next track.--go buy an mp3 cdplayer like pine technology's"
1,RIO 600 IS JUNK,"I got a Rio 600 and I have not had it for more than one month. Why??? It keeps breaking, first the light, than the firmware. I cannot stand it. THEN THE SOFTWARE AND HEADPHONES BROKE!!! I would never by this product again. However I do like the player size and function but it is junk. THINK ELSEWARE!!!"
2,Dave,"The Diamond Rio 600 is great looking, compact and easy to use. Unfortunately, all its good points have been offset by a flimsy on/off switch. The on/off switch on our first DR 600 broke the day after it was received. The on/off switch on the replacement DR 600 broke after less than a week. Too bad, because otherwise it seems like a good product.Dave"
1,Unaccessible customer service,"This was a wildly expected Christmas present, but 2 months later we have yet to be able to get customer service to help with the software which doesnt work! Can you imagine a customer service unit which is not available at lunch time? Totally frustrating experience for my daughter and for Santa Claus."
3,Good.....But it dosen't WORK!,"Well I was extremely excited when I bought this product. I just couldn't wait to tear it out of the box and plug it in. Well I wasm't around my computer so I just put the battery in, and wow, there were some songs ( 7 )allready on the thing. So I decided to play them, thare was a neat toutorial, and some rock and other stuff. Well I thought that after this it would be a great product....WRONG! I pluged it in my computer and the computer didn't even know that it was there. I tried all the stuff on the FAQ's and other manuals, but none of the suggestions worked. So know I am listening to the same seven songs over and over again countin the hours till I can return it. Though not including this MINOR problem, there are some nice features on the RIO. Maby I got a faulty product.. But now I will either replace it, or get a Samsung Yepp. Well if you chose to buy this GoOd LuCk."
1,Some bad units out there,"I purchased a Rio 600 at CompUSA and returned it a week later. It exhibited the same problems a few of you have commented on: (1) the introduction of painfully loud pops and crackles into the music, and (2) the inability to play MP3 files to completion. The software is not too great. I assume, from the overwhelming positive reviews, that not everyone has this problem but beware."
1,"If you like shoddy craftsmanship, then purchase this player","I bought this player off of Tigerdirect, and it was great for about 3 months. (minus horrible battery life and small storage capacity, even w/ the extra 32mb backpack). After the first three months, it simply stopped working. Wouldn't turn on, no response at all.Wrote SonicBlue, after a couple of weeks of going back and forth and finally convincing them that it wasn't a firmware update issue, they agreed to 'let' me mail it to them (at my cost) and they would repair or send me a replacement. i guess they did replace it, but after about three months of use, i am getting the same problems again. I wish I had believed other reviews about this product. If you're into masochism, then by all means, get this thing. if not, save up for an iPod or anything else but Rio. You get what you pay for... (paid $70)"
1,No good!,"Yes, the headphones are unusable and don't fit human ears, but most importantly, I had to return 2 of these units because they died after anywhere between 5 and 14 days of use. I changed the battery and that didn't help, either, so there is some defect in the manufacturing process which makes these things blow up relatively quickly.Save the money on this dud until they get it right."
1,"Has a great first run, then watch out!","I was on cloud 9 with this product for about a week: wma compatible, nice headphones, etc. Then I needed to change the battery, and all hell broke loose. The backpack failed to snap back on after replacing the battery, then the off/on switch snapped and wouldn't work anymore. Within a week, this had turned into one useless product. So I took it back and exchanged it for the Intel 3000: it may look a little clunkier and the headphones aren't as nice, but it's been great so far, and I haven't had any problems changing batteries.Buyer beware!"
1,Broke in One Day,"The item worked for the first day and no longer. I wrote email to SonicBlue and get no response. Earphones worked on other MP3 player. Recorded songs, but playback had nothing but static. Burns you up when a company won't support it's products."
1,Static electricity broke mine (within days),I've run into the same problem as the other guys. All of sudden all it plays is STATIC...poor quality instrument. My kid's main Christmas gift and now he had nothing!
2,short of expectations,"The Rio 600 was a bit of a disappointment. First of all, within a week or two, the supplied earplugs separated and the control pad used to play the songs became increasingly more difficult to depress. Getting a song to play was at times almost impossible. One thing that I really did not like was the inaccurate power monitor for the batteries. When the Rio said that I had < 4 hrs playing time, it would not play. According to the power monitor, the battery still had 1/3 of its power, but yet the Rio did not play. I must say that I have been dissappointed with the Rio. I would recommend the Rio as a[n]..alternative to people..."
2,Wait for More Memory,"Most MP3 players are not made that well, RIO is the best of the lot. The 600 is functional but has little memory, and as of yet, expansion memory is not available, and no prices are set for it as well; you really don't know what you're going to be charged. There is an 800 model coming out with twice the memory, definitely worth waiting for. Buy a RIO, just not this one, yet. Wait for more information."
1,"terrible service, terrible player",I bought this player hoping to end my mp3 woes but to my surprise. the sound quality died in one week. I e-mailed rio and talked to a technician in town and he said send it to them. but they charged me 30 dollars just to send it to them. what a sham. poor software that always crashes. please try look into a different player
2,ok player when it works that is!,"I got mine from audible.com, it was refurbished and it truly will work when it wants to, regardless of new battery or position."
4,great audio,"it is the kick a** mp3 player of the 2000 year , when i got it in japan i brought it to my computer and started loding and playing mp3's , it was the easy to use."
4,"Great Product, Where's the Upgrades?","I bought it, I love it, but when the hell are the upgrades going to come out? I've been waiting for months, what is the deal? They advertise that its upgradable to 300+MB but they have NO upgrades available. They should have at least made the external 32MB available before they shipped this. The 32MB that comes with it doesn't cut it.I bought it because it was inexpensive and I figured it could be upgradable. If you want a MP3 player I suggest getting one with at least 64MB's."
2,a great product but...,"I was looking for an inexpensive MP3 player for when I go to the gym or beach. Something that if I dropped it in the parking lot I wouldn't be heartbroken or bankrupt over the loss. This was the player for me. What they didn't tell you is that the software and Windows XP don't play well together. I tried downloading different drivers and such from their website. I just made a bigger mess than I had before. Long and short...I had to borrow a friends computer running Windows Me to get things to work. Once it did, I loved my little gadget. It was just a long process to get there."
1,Great Product - while it worked,I have had the same experience with this player that others have written about regarding the higher end players. Everything was going along fine when suddenly the player emitted a high shriek and ceased to work. This problem is not documented at all and there is no way to troubleshoot it. Nothing fixes it and it is dead in the water....
1,SUCKS!,"A poorly designed product doesn't require a whole lot wrong to be utterly worthless, so please be aware of the sheer number of problems with this piece of crap before you buy it: - Early versions (mine) have a rubberized skin that shreds the first time you put it in your pocket. It looks terrible after one day. - The product looks nice (which should impress ID magazine) but the software (PC) is heinous, counter-intuitive & circumlocutious. It is awesomely bad. - The Rio inexplicably ceases loading tunes after about thirty songs have been pushed on to it, and tells you you must get an upgrade. - The e-mail support for this product is terrible. The clueless replies answer questions you didn't even ask and skip answering the one you did submit. - My Rio has stiopped working and my call back to replace it is now overdue. - AVOID THIS PRODUCT AND PUNISH THE COMPANY BY CHOOSING ANOTHER BRAND. THEY DON'T DESERVE YOUR PATRONAGE."
4,Rio 600,"I like the device but have a couple complaints: not enough memory 32 is just too small and I can't find the upgrade modules yet. No belt clip, a case is extra $$ I'm hoping the fm tuner remote and extra memory modules will be out soon and be affordable. (can`t be too soon for me). I use a Mac and already use the included soundjam software, the usb download was fast and software easy to use, I just need more memory! The price was reasonable as well, but we'll see when I add-in the extras I want."
3,Mad in Miami,"If it didn't cost so much, I would chuck this thing. I was a happy listener for 6 days. Although the battery life is like 2 minutes, I was happy with the great sound and I was able to put about 27 songs. (Mixture of MP3s and WMAs) BUT now... for no reason, the only sound I get is STATIC and POPS. It seems like I am not the only one. I am not sure that I want them to replace this again. I think I will look elsewhere in the future. The 2 stars are for the sound - when it works!!"
3,"Good product so far, extra memory too expensive","I just purchased the RIO 600 yesterday, and it works like it'ssupposed to--sounds great, gets about 55 min. of WMA audio at64kb/s. The 'joypad' which selects FF/play/pause and stop is a littlehard to use--you have to touch in just the right spot or you will skipto the next or previous track instead of playing or pausing. Mybiggest complaint is that the extra memory 'backpacks' are sopricey. $... for another 32MB!! 64MB costs as much as the playeritself. It's scary to contemplate what the 340 MB backpack might cost,if it ever is released. If you can get by with 45-55 minutes of musicto take with you, it's a good buy. If you need more memory, buy aplayer that uses smart media cards--they're about a dollar a megabyte"
2,Not really worth it,"Presumably the only reason someone would buy this is for the b-sides. Well, unlike the previous Hail to the Thief singles, the b-sides here are junk. Even though Myxomatosis is one of the best tracks on HTTF, the remix doesn't really do it justice (a very mellow approach). The demo of ""There There"" is interesting, but not much more than that (it's not something I'd want to listen to more than once or twice). If you absolutely have to have every Radiohead release, I'm sure you've bought this already. Otherwise stay away!"
2,a let down in the b-side department,"If you're buying this, you're most likely interested in the b-sides. Radiohead is normally reliable in this department, so it was a surprise to me that both b-sides were underwhelming. 'remyxomatosis' i wouldn't necessarily call mild, just a bit scattered--off-kilter beats that don't really hold, and eerie keyboards. 'there there' truly has a demo-ish sound to it, with one fuzzy guitar to the left, and quieter scratch vocals with harmonies. the percussion was in place early on for this song, and is nice enough. in sum, their b-sides are still better than most people's a-sides, but these rank as some of their thinner efforts."
2,"Lots of scatter, no brain","The b-sides on part 2 are slightly better than part one, but still not worth shelling out the cash for. The Scatterbrained remix is pretty good and fits well with the track, but it's nothing special. ""I Will"" has the full band backing and some alternate vocals, and is maybe the best of the 4 ""2+2"" b-sides, but remember that there's a reason they used the other version on the LP -- it's better. So buy this if you must, otherwise stay away.And can someone tell me why the greedy record companies can't just release all the tracks on one darn CD? This is getting out of control."
4,A great demo version of There There,"This part one of two CDs, features a great remix of Myxomatosisthat sounds even more scary than the original, with amazing vocalefx, and beats. Track 3 is the very first demo of There There, which is interesting to listen to, very groovy and over 7 minutes long. The vocals singing 'We are accidents waiting to happen' at the end are so haunting it makes you feel like closing you eyes, like a cat..."
4,Finally that remix of scatterbrain...,"First of all, let me say that im a huge radiohead fan, so imnot easilly deceived... I've been waiting for this single to come up for quite a while now, and i got exactly whut i expectedin this single, unfortunatly sliced in two parts ($$). Thissecond part of the single include the amazing remix SKTTRBRAIN,that sounds like the original, but more electronica. The vocal at the end is sampled and played in a way that reminds me ofthe live version of EVERYTHING IN ITS RIGHT PLACE. The Third track is the original uncut demo version of I WILL, called here the 'Los Angeles version', which sounds even more haunting thanthe original version. For any big Radiohead fan such as i, thisis definitly a great buy."
2,"Unfortunately, these are not good single...","The latest two single of Radiohead are not like the other ones. No new songs, just remixes. CD One is a bit be more interesting than CD Two just because of the first version of There There, but it doesn't sound good and it's not worth it. So this duet of single doesn't worth it..."
3,My Futile Aspirations Confirmed,"Anyone that loves golf and shoots a good round here and there has experienced the ""why can't I do that every time"" mentality. In ""The Fine Green Line"", John Newport takes that belief to the next level and puts into proper perspective the difficulty of ""mastering"" the addictive and occassionally rewarding game. I recommend this book for the regular or avid golfer who may be helplessly addicted and wants a humorous and very real account of just how mentally difficult consistently good golf can be."
5,The Quest,"John Paul Newport's wonderful tale about his pursuit of excellence in the game of golf shows great insight into everyone's desire for success and the consequent self esteem that accompanies it. An adventure from beginning to end, in its reading we learn much about the game, about John and, hopefully, about ourselves."
1,Painful,"I actually found this one hard to finish. The authors obsession and anal-retentiveness make for a hard read. Here is a three- handicapper that decides to take the plunge and do what all of us golfers dream about. He then procedes to ruin his game and the story by being obsessed with every bit of minutia about his swing and then analyzing his swing to death. It just goes on and on. There are much better books than this on the subject. Try ""Tin Cup Dreams"" and ""Bud, Sweat and Tees""."
3,Good read but less than inspiring,"Mr. Newport is certainly a golfer of the caliber I would like to attain and an even better writer! After reading this book I realized he must have been a definite wizard with the English language for me not to walk away from his never ending self defeating diatribe, nothing very inspiring thank you. He does however not blame anything else than himself for his performances (a conclusion definitely not along the lines of his political beliefs) and does not preach equalizing legislation! This is not an inspiring book for golfers. There are never-ending descriptions of hooks, slices, missed putts and rounds in the 80's. I do admire the respect and endorsement he received from his direct family. But all in all I feel more like I sponsored his trek by purchasing his book then anything I will ever get out of it. Then again I'm the only one responsible for my actions."
4,Book review,"Book in adequate shape, great value for price! All pages intact. Arrived within time frame. Book itself is great if your a golf addict!!"
3,"I enjoyed it, but you might not","I think many reviewers have oversold the book. I enjoyed it and I would recommend it to other golfers. If you are not a golfer or are a golfer who does not have a strong interest in reading about other people playing golf, then I would not recommend the book to you. The author devotes a year to seeing how good he can get at golf. I don't think he ever believed he would become a tour pro, but he thought he would improve dramatically (as I am sure we all believe). You will read about many rounds of golf (details about specific shots and scores), golf lessons, golf psychologists, etc. If you do not golf, I think you would hate the book. It is not a 'journey' book in that you do not necessarily enjoy his 'journey' through the process,you enjoy living golf when you read the book. I golf and enjoy reading about it, so I liked the book a lot. This is a four star book for one audience and a one star book for another, so I settled on three."
2,A Revelation in Failure,"How can a 3 handicapper spend a year preparing & then shoot 96 & 88 in Q school ? - read the book & find out - however , golfers beware as you know what negative mental thoughts can do in golf - this book has enough for a lifetime !! I think we need success stories & not this detailed failure ! the author must have gotten an upfront payment & commitment to publish, because most would reject. i suggest "" a miracle on the 17th Green"" for a better read."
1,Worst Golf Book Ever?,"This book is painful to read. Ending up skipping many paragraphs that were the author totally overanalyzing his swing or own mental state, as I wanted to finish the book figuring it would be fun to learn about the mini-tours -- golf's single-A leagues. Learned a little, but most of the book is the author self-flaggelating blather about his mental state, or lack thereof. Was hoping to hear about the background and dreams of the various cast of characters on the tours -- there might be five pages of that in a 300-page sleep-aid. Spends a full page explaining how his choice of socks ruined his round. This book is incorrectly titled. It should be ""Fine Green Gap: The Pipe Dreams of a Three-Handicap and How He Got to Write a Book About It."""
4,"Interesting, amusing book","It's an entertaining, easy, fun to read book. Funny parts, poignant parts, interesting and insightful parts on the nature of golf and the professionals who dream to play the game well. The author writes skillfully, hinting that he writes better than indicated in the book. He falls into that trap of many a golf writer, writing down to an imagined audience of dumb golf nuts. Give the numbskull run of the mill non-literate golfer the quick easy non-challenging golf book they want...after all that's what'll sell. For this reason, I'd have to say that while JP Newport is a great mass-market golf writer, he's unlikely to generate a prose style within the category of a GREAT one. Fun book!"
1,Boring,"I would not recommend this book. I found it a waste of time, another guy takes a year and thinks he can become a pro. His story is boring and predictable."
1,"Made in USA, Defective","Bought this product at the gun show in Del Mar, if I remember correctly, a couple of years ago. Jams in both my Romanian SAR1's (AK-47) chambers badly, live ammo manually cycles fine. This problem wasn't easy to figure out unless you know what to look for.CNC machined made in USA. Products like this gives the Made in USA label a bad name. Apparently there was no QC inspection at all on these snap caps and I'm not the only one by any means. The angle of the shoulder is incorrect. I found this from a single blog that runs many pages long and finally toward the end they found the problem. Normally I archive info in HTML on my storage devices but for some unknown reason I can't find this specific file.Will update with a link if and when I find the file. Meanwhile best to return the product to the vendor for a replacement or find another seller that will exchange the product for you."
2,OUCH!!!,THIS IS A TOTALLY BEAUTIFUL SHOE. HOWEVER THE SHOE SEEMS TO RUN SMALL AND THE QUALITY IS COMPARABLE TO TARGET OR PAYLESS. THANK GOD IT IS ON SALE.
2,Summary more than an article,"Good content, but this is much more of a summary than an article. I found some of the content to be a little helpful, but most of the information was based on the authors company and may not apply universally. I did not think it was worth $5.99."
1,Not Very Happy,"We actually purchased 2 of the exact same product for the same location. The first one lasted 1 hour before it failed, so I ordered another one this one lasted 1 day before failing. My customer decided to go else where."
1,Terrible,"My daughter hated this movie. She thought it would be an all-around good kid movie to watch with her friends during a sleepover. But it ended up being ""one of the worst movies"" she's ever seen. Most of the movie was about Big Foot. How ridiculous! Overall, she said the movie was terrible and she would not recommend it to anyone. Big let-down!"
2,Did not work for us....,"Saw this movie with an eight and a seven year old girl. They read Judy Moody books, but this movie just did not work for them, or for me. They were grossed out by some of the scenes, instead of laughing. Honestly, the girls tolerated the movie because the other option was to not watch anything at all!"
1,I HATE IT.,"This is the WORST movie that i have seen. I thought it was going to be good when i saw the commercials, so i went to the movie theaters and absoulutely NOTHING WAS FUNNNY AT ALL. All what they try to do is they make games of the movie and soooo much advertisements to make money, so you know it will be terrible and it allready is."
3,A Fun Summer Movie For Kids!!!,"This movie was about what I expected. Full of hyper kids trying to have a fun summer. Jordana Beatty was a pretty good choice for Judy. When Judy Moody's friends go away for the summer, she tries her best to have fun with her aunt Opal, and brother Stink. They try to get 'thrill points' by hunting for Bigfoot, riding a rollercoaster, and watching horror movies. If you like silly kids movies, you might like JUDY MOODY AND THE NOT BUMMER SUMMER!!!"
4,VERY GOOD! FUNNY MOVIE!,MY DAUGHTER REALLY ENJOYS THIS MOVIE. VERY GOOD CHOICE FOR A YOUNG GIRL. PARENT CHOICE FOR SURE AS WELL. YAY!
5,Judy Moody,I love this movie. I could watch it everyday! It was very funny and entertaining. I am so glad I rented and watched it on my Apple. Thank you
5,Fun Movie,"For whatever reason me, my sister and a couple of friends decided to watch this movie. I was really surprised how much we enjoyed it. It's a fun movie. So I've added it to my collection."
5,great birthday gift,"Bought this for my grand daughters birthday, was on her wish list so I was a hit. Love getting books she loves to read."
3,daughter loves,"My daughter loves this movie, she is 7 and says she thinks it would be fun to come up with some of the stuff Judy does"
1,Astral Odyssey,"The author of this book spent way too much time on dreams and way to little time on actual astral travel. Her attempts at astral travel seem to be little better than vivd dreams. I was really dissapointed by this book. If you are looking for a book to help you astral travel, leave this one on the shelf and find a btter one. Although I am sure the author was sincere, the book fell short of what I wanted."
2,The jury is still out on this one...,"The author seems to confuse Out of Body Experiences and higher Lucid dreaming in her book. Much of her OBE experiences seems to end in failure and nothing seems to come of them. While this may be her experiences, it isn't what I was expecting from an author on Out of Body Experiences. This is a fair book if you have much material on OBE and want to continue reading about it... Beginners stay away please!"
1,Should have been called Astral Phoney!,"This is a perfect example of the true meaning ""Don't judge a book by its cover"". The amount of people that have bought this very book (which is in its millions), show how many are beguiled by front covers. I'll be the first to admit that I fell into the trap regarding this book.""Astral Odyssey"" is 95% nonsense regarding dreams and the other 5% mentions everything you probably already know about astral projection (OBE's).The front cover has the copy ""Exploring out-of-body experiences"" and within Chapter 1 'Discovery of a hidden realm', you do believe you're onto a winner of a book, until page 3 (of 255 pages), where it all goes down hill. Obviously 'OBE' books sell more than 'dream' books, at least this would explain why this dream book has been marketed towards people with OBE interest.A complete phoney...don't be fooled."
1,Will The Real Don Imus Please Stand Up,In my humble opinon this book does not even touch the mean streak and obnoxiousness that was Don Imus during the 60's and 70's as a former intern at WNBC there are many things that the author of this book either did not know about the real Don Imus or did know but did not publish it.
1,Not worth the money,"Being an Imus fan I was looking for something a little more substatnial than this. If you're interested in the book, go to the library and check it out. Don't bother buying it,"
4,Highly recommended for all Imus fans,"Although this is Reed's first foray into the world of publishing, the material is delivered in an informative and interesting style. It is a very enjoyable read for all fans of Don Imus."
1,An insult to the written word,"Sure, I'm an I-fan. Okay, maybe there are some tidbits of trivia in this book that are of some interest. However, this has to be one of the worst-written books ever to see the light of day. As intriguing as the subject matter might be, Jim Reed has done no favors for Don Imus by producing this terribly written book. Don't waste your time or money. Just listen to WFAN and get it from the horse's mouth (or other part of the anatomy)."
2,YOU CAN DO BETTER,"PAY ATTENTION TO THE ""CONS"" LISTED IN THE PRODUCT REVIEW. THEY ARE TWO OF ITS BIGGEST DRAWBACKS. ALSO: DISC TITLE INPUT IS SLOW AND TEDIOUS. (THE COMPARABLEY PRICED SONY MODELS HAVE A KEYBOARD INPUT!) YOU HAVE TO STOP THE DISC TO CHANGE PLAY MODES. FOR A A FEW EXTRA BUCKS YOU CAN GET A LOT MORE FOR YOUR MONEY."
1,Very sensitive unit.,Your CDs better be perfect to play correctly. I have 200 CDs installed. 5 percent of the CDs skip. I am talking about new CDs here with no scratches. Other complaints are loud loading mechanism. If I had to do it over again I would have bought something else.
3,"Good player, but does not do CDRs","This is a good player overall; it's a bit noisy, and it doesn't like scratched CDs. This player simply DOES NOT PLAY cdrs; it makes a really nasty clunking noise and spits it out. I've written to JVC about this with no response; it doesn't make sense that they make a device for recording CDRs, then their own players won't handle them."
2,Too many problems,"When this unit jammed the first time, I took it in under warranty. Now it is jammed again and I am ready to give it to my local high school eletronics class and get a better one.It also skipped a lot for no reason. Another dissappointment: it cant play a random selection of a particular genre or user group. I am very dissappointed in JVC."
2,Apparent solution to the skipping problems!,"Like many reviewers I encountered the apparently fatal skipping problems during playback. They started around the time the warranty expired and only got worse. Very frustrating.Years later, after learning what caused a similar problem with a DVD player (different brand), I discovered a fix. I removed the many CD boxes that I had piled on top of the player. Apparently the weight was too much. It has not skipped since!!Aside from that, the player itself/functions and sound quality are decent. Probably would have been 4 stars."
4,Great Device But...,"This is a great device for the price it costs. It indeed plays CDRs with no problem. This device allows you to organize your CDs by Genre, Author and CD name. Its remote control is compact and complete. Finally, it has a beautiful design.Some annoying stuff:- noisy when changing a CD (but it is not an important stuff, and sometimes it makes you feel like in a Robocop movie due to the mecanism sound)- doesn't have an RS232 interface for data input. It is painful to input each CD information using arrows and an enter button...- doesn't have memory for the CDs based on their serial number. If you change a CD place, the system won't recognize it so you will need to re-input all the information."
1,creasy carrousel,"I bough this product and it work well for only 8 months, at this moment the carrousel is all creasy and the discs don't plays."
2,Lacking,"Aside from the fact that as soon as the warranty expired the CD player started jamming often, I was disappointed with it from the beginning. Although one can categorize each CD by genre one can't have the player play a random selection of a particular genre which makes the random function rather useless it's difficult to have a dinner party and have the CD player skip from Miles davis to Red Hot Chilli Peppers to Chopin. These days there are players with even larger capacities. One can do better..."
4,JVC XL-MC334BK CD Changer,"The XL-MC334BK CD Changer is a nice product at a really good price. It works good, the only drawbacks are the inability to play random within groups of CD's and the lack of an RS232 interface to load all of the CD title,author,track etc info. It plays CDR's just fine, the person who said it doesn't is absolutely WRONG."
2,Skip to the Loo JVC,"I bought this changer over a year ago to replace a Sony 10 disk that had burnt out. Figured I'd go with a different manufacturer this time. BIG mistake. I have NEVER seen a CD player skip as much as this one. Other reviewers who have mentioned this know what I mean. I can put a brand new disk in there and it will skip. I put the same disk in my cheap portable or my car changer and there's no problem. A disk has to be completly perfect for this player. And, like someone else said, it does not like CD-R's. It will play some just fine, but skip more than not. This is the LAST JVC CD player I will ever buy, and I'm looking to get rid of it already. Stay away!"
5,power wheel charger,good product and very quick to charge. you no longer have to worry about charging up your power wheel battery the night before
5,easy to use,this is one easy to use plug. when the battery is done you just plug it in to this cord. nothing confusing to set up. a kid can use this.
1,Car battery charger,Very disappointed that the charger was not the correct one even though the web site indicated it was appropriate. I'm sure it would work on somebody's car. Now I am stuck with it.
3,Why is it this does not have Re-Arranged on it?,"No one probably cares about this, but this is an overpriced import for the phat song Re-Arranged. However, this is the second part of the import, so it does not even contain the song Re-arrnaged. Instead it contains the Nookie, two videos and two remixes of the Counterfiet. All of these songs / videos and more can be found on the import of Significant Other's bonus disc which you can get for $25. As for the videos, they are played in a very small screen on your computer which you cannot resize. This item is really only for a collector."
5,This is truly a shawl!,"The shawl is bigger than we expected and that's a good thing. Very soft and warm. A beautiful purple. Not to bright. Very subtle. The fringe on the end is just the right size. My wife is 5'3"" and with it around her shoulders, up around her neck, the back hangs below her derriere. This is a true shawl, not an oversized scarf! Amazing value. Great customer service!"
5,My wife's favorite color,"We had been talking about alpaca when this shawl showed up in Amazon's great buys. Since this particular shade of purple is my wife's favorite color I just had to order it. The seller immediately contacted me to let me know that the item had been shipped via airmail from Ecuador. He also gave a good idea of the transit time. It was well worth the short wait (it arrived sooner than expected). The shawl is very well made, soft and warm. The construction is excellent, the color wonderful and material incredibly soft. In addition to detailed care instructions there was a cute little Ecuadorian decorative pin as a little thank you bonus. If you are in the market for alpaca don't hesitate. You won't be disappointed."
1,Poor quality with material of chemical fiber,"Three weeks ago, I ordered the Extra 40% Off Super Soft Baby Alpaca Wool Reversible Shawl Wrap Cape sold and shipped by Great Gift idea Etc from Amazon. After I received it, I find its material is chemical fibers but not 100% pure natural alpaca wool as described on the Amazon internet and the label on them. The chemical products are not worth of so high price.And also, it is difficult to return it because you should make sure your returned stuffs can be received by Great Gift Ideas Etc (not in US, address is Suite 11-B, Ave Gonzalez N31-55 y Gonnessiat, Quito, Ecuador) within 30 days. Anyway, if you want to buy it, think it over!"
3,Beautiful but not too practical,This incense burner is beautiful but does not catch all of the burned incense leaving a good portion on the counter top or table where you are burning it. I have to burn it so it extends most of the incense over the sink or a bowl to catch the extra incense.
1,A big disappointment,"I loved Family Feud and was very excited to get this game.. it was a big disappointment! The description says ""features the voice and likeness of your favorite game show host!"" The ""host"" doesn't look like any of the past hosts and all of the questions are typed - there's no ""voice"". It takes forever to get to the question, and then if you don't type it exactly the way the game has it typed you get it wrong. You can customize your ""family"" but it doesn't save the changes, so why bother. I'd say don't bother with the game at all."
2,Fusturating To Play,"I was really looking forward to getting Family Feud since I used to watch the TV show. The game can be fun at time but the fusturation ruins the game. The answers have to be exact to count. One question asked something that can get on your windshield. I said ""bugs"" and got an X. The computer says bug which is the top answer on the board. For a modern game to not be programmed to allow slight variations is annoying.Even worse is some of the answers on the top answer board. Many don't even make sense and almost seem like they are made up. One that stands out is to answer something twin boys might share growing up. One of the answers on the board is a girlfriend! There are many type of answers that will confuse you.The game claims to have 1000 different questions yet I have gotten many repeats only after a few weeks of owning the game.I was expecting a much better game."
3,Just make sure it's the right stuff!,"I've been using this product for 4 years now. It's the only product from Meguiar's that my car will tolerate. All other Meguiar's products basically fail on my car because the factory paint is just un-friendly. I like this product, but I've managed to find 5 bottles within a 4 year span that had a different solution in it than what it's supposed to have. Meguiar's Quik Detailer should be white in color. When applied, it should be easy to wipe off with no streaks. The 5 bad bottles I've come across had a blue solution in it and if applied leaves horrible streaks. In order to get rid of these streaks, I had to give my car a good wash and use a pre wax cleanser to remove the streaks plus the light film haze it also produced. In short, when purchasing Meguiar's Quik Detailer just make sure the solution inside is white and not blue."
3,Better than Water?,"I like to keep my car looking as nice as possible all the time so that when I hit the road, my Lexus GX 470 stands out on the road. Fine. I bought this product simply to avoid having to wash the car everytime I go through a puddle or my kids paw the car doors.Now, does the product work? Absolutely. Would water work? Probably. This is why I only gave it three stars. The question is, will I buy another bottle when this one runs out? Um...probably. Just in case this product does do a better job cleaning up little messes, I'll stick with it. Maybe it does protect the wax layer I have on. Maybe it does add a little bit of protection. Maybe it does give a little shine. I can't tell. But to be on the safe side, I'll hand over the dough just the same."
2,Mixed impression,"I ordered this floppy drive in order to save data to an external media with an iMac running OS X. The drive itself seems well constructed, although I was disappointed that it did not come with a grape ""skin"".OS X interoperability is poor, however. OS X recognizes the drive when it is plugged in to the usb port, and recognizes the disk if it is inserted when the drive is plugged in. HOWEVER, ejecting a disk after it is connected to the computer doesn't work.Some of this may be because OS X is expecting software-controlled ejects, but it is still disappointing. VST still doesn't have an OS X driver available (as of 7/30/01). Unfortunately, this seems to be the only game in town."
5,Great Upright Bass Work,If you like jazz and upright bass then this is a must have CD for your collection. This CD is one of my faves X)
3,Bike Tire,This is listed as OEM for my bike I found it on Amazon for a good price. The only thing about the Exedra G722 is I only get about 5500 to 6200 miles on the rear tire so for the price I guess its exceptable.
1,Amazon should be embarissed that they're selling this...,"Out of OVER 30 CDs I have wasted on this driver, only three have successfully completed. I think that says it all"
1,Horrible worst ever DON'T BUY Instead Buy the HP 9150i cd-rw,Drive was horribe destroyed 10 disks software was really bad was on hold for 3 hours for 10 cents a minute on my phone bill.
3,ok i guess,i thought is was a great cd- burner but it can't beet the HP'S they are the best you should get the HP9301i it really kicks
5,Works as advertised,"This product works. I was skeptical because of the D-link brand, but this thing is great. I installed it to allow wireless @ our marina, and we get full signal over the entire area, just under 2 acres. The unit itself is made very well, everything you need comes in the box, POE, antenna's, cables, lightning protection, all there.."
5,"Good company, good product.",I have purchased 3 of these antennas for my small business. I am very happy with them.Can recommend.
3,for hard core fans,"I love Michael Roe's music and the 77's are a classic band from my high school era, but this is better left for the ""completists"". If you want all of the hard to find cd's, pick this up (currently selling for around $10 which is a good deal imo). With that said, if you're looking at picking up your first, or second 77's disc you'd be better served starting with ""Pray Naked"", ""The 77's"". ""Sticks & Stones"", or ""Drowning with Land in Sight"".The only song that really stands out here to me is ""miserable"", but that's probably personal preference more than universal appeal."
4,A good book in need of an update,"This is a good book in an interesting format - a collection of comic strips that chronicles Lisa's battle with breast cancer. This format is more accessible for many who read comic books or strips. There are several strips in Lisa's Story that are NOT available on the King Features website. The strips are from 1999, the book 2000. In 2006, there was a ""second chapter"" in the story: recurrence. I hope that Mr. Batiuk publishes an updated version of Lisa's Story collecting all of the strips, including the ones from 2006. Now out of print, but definitely worth ordering at the available prices - I ordered one for me, and two for the local oncology center's lending library. UPDATE: Please note that an update was published in late 2007."
3,Be careful,There is a different book with a very similar title--Lisa's Story: the Other Shoe. I was disappointed when I received this book as a gift. It tells only part of Lisa's story.
1,"a cutesy/powderpuff look at primary, early-stage bc","Like so many breast cancer books out there, this one fuels one of the great myths of breast cancer today: Lisa survives the disease and they all live happily ever after. This and many of the texts on breast cancer tend to gloss over the reality: that no one is ever really safe from the possibility of their cancer returning. And if it does, there's really nothing funny about it.If, like me, you stumbled upon this one while trying to find books on advanced breast cancer...don't waste your time or money. They don't deal with that reality here.To their credit, the book does include an extensive list of references -- though only one dealt with the subject I am trying to research and it, as well as a few other Web sites I tried, were out-of-date and/or the information wasn't available."
4,Does it really make a difference?,"Does this product really make a difference with menopause symptoms? I don't know. Hot flashes do seem to be lessening, but that may be because I'm getting older."
3,WARNING: HUGE PILLS,"I bought Solaray because I trust their quality and have tried several other estrogen replacements with no success. I'll report on the effectiveness of this product when the bottle is all used up. But for now I just want to warn other shoppers that the softgels are literally one inch long. I have a hard time swallowing pills, and if I had known they were this big, I would not have bought them. I have to be honest that I kinda hope they don't work so I don't have to choke them down for years to come."
1,I hate reviews,"Ordered this for my post-menopausal wife, you'd have to ask her. Must be working, she's not snapping my head off."
1,It really doesn't fit.....,Received the ash tray. Its small. It rattles around in the cup holder. It's hard to hit with a cigerette. Impossible to hit with a cigar. Not impressed....
5,Husband Loves it,This was a gift for my husband (he picked it out himself) and he loves it. He keeps it in the cupholder next to him and is lost without it. (This was actually a replacement because the old one was accidentally tossed at the car wash!)
5,Fantastic side of WWII every student and history buff should,This is an award-winner! What a great story. Women were the backbone of the military effort in WWII and this video is a great tribute to them.
5,Geri Is Sure To Bag Up Number One!,I love this song by Geri! I love every song if I think about it! LOL But I really like this song. 'Look At Me' & 'Bag It Up' are the two GREAT songs on the album. Make sure you buy this single!Girl Power Forever!
2,domestic album is worth a few dollars more.,"Sure, 'Bag It Up' is one of the highlights from the first Spice Girl solo album. However, for just a few dollars more for the domestic pressing of the entire album you'll get more highlights than you will here. 'These Boots Are Made For Walking', an unoriginal choice for a cover, is featured here in an out-dated, stiff production; 'Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps' simply demonstrates Halliwell's straightjacket vocal limitations as much as the latter mentioned does her flatness. Five stars? Please!"
3,Reading = Passing,"I bought this book recently because I was going to take the test which coincides with it. Exam Cram still makes the best books for studying for Microsoft tests. However, I recently read SMS 2003 is going to be out in beta this summer and then release sometime next year at which time the cert in SMS 2.0 will be extinct. My advice to you is don't take the SMS test right now; wait for the next version of SMS and the next SMS test. This book is still worth the purchase if only to better understand SMS technologies in preparation for the upcoming SMS which is still a viable Microsoft product and will be fully AD integrated upon its release. If you are looking for a quick elective to complete the MCSE track SMS 2.0 may be an easy one to get and this book will definitely get you one step closer to completing the test. Your choice - wait for SMS 2003 or plunge into SMS 2.0."
5,i think this book would b one of da best computers book,there is something that i dont like about this book is that its not published and i need it badly i need to take exam for it next week and i dont still have a book now i dont even know what or how would i pass da exam if you kan hurry da hell up and have it published i would really appericiate it please reply me wid da info about this book on my email address abshahid@aol.com
1,big regret,"Lots of dropped packets, SPI kills most good outbound connections. Had a really bad experience with this. No firmware updates since 2006 - so don't expect any fixes."
3,Does a good job....,"Does a good job of protecting your PC and runs everything in Stealth Mode. Only problem I am having with is setting up or getting a PS3 to connect to the Internet. The Router won't recognize the PS3 for some reason and the UPNP Mode does not work right, in turn your PlayStation 3 cannot get setup through the router. If anyone knows how to do this please email me on how to do it. Thanks in advance!"
5,Poor Support. Tech could barely speak english. Amazon sent me another one.,The unit would connect to the internet but the internal web server that provides configuration settings didn't work [...] produced nothing. Returned it to Amazon for exchange. I just hope the replacement is better!Amazon's return process is easy and quick.After receiving my second unit I found it wasn't to difficult to set up my static IP and port forwarding. They call it virtual server.I don't do any gaming. So now only time will tell if it works well or not.THANKS TO AMAZON FOR SUPERIOR SUPPORT IN THE REPLACEMENT OF THE FIRST UNIT!
1,D-Link dont stand behind there produck,I had this worked good for five months then could not get on internet call them and sent it back they sent it back to me and still dont work i no it is the d link because i put my cisco router back on and internet working fine i call them about this and all i got was a runaround and it was all scratch up i want never buy noing from d link a gain.D-Link DGL-4100 4-Port GamerLounge Broadband Gigabit Gaming Router
5,THE BEST ROUTER I HAVE USED !!!,"I bought this router because I was trying to get (2) X-Box 360's running on my single cable internet connection. This was something I could never do with my previous router. It works flawlessly Setup was as easy as plugging it in Done! I can now run (2) X-Box 360's on the same connection, host a match and be downloading music on my computer at the same time with no problem at all! I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMEND TO ANY SERIOUS GAMERS!!!!"
2,I'm on my second one...,"...and it is starting to freeze up as well. I'd avoid the H/W Ver A1 as it seems to be prone to problems, if their tech support is to be believed. Router works great, and does seem to reprioritize traffic as advertised... for about a day. After that it freezes tight as a drum (no response through the web admin page) and will only work again if hard reset. This is the second one to show the same symptoms.On the plus side, a breeze to set up. One wizard and a plethora of configuration options. Most of the recent games are available through the pulldowns in the gamefuel section. Really well designed and thought out, just not very reliable. Yet. I hope.This looks like it could be a great product if D-Link can resolve these freezes."
5,Great Value for the $$!,"Powerfull and robust, this router is worth every penny. My ping times in most games are sub 70ms at all times. Loaded with great firewall options, you'll find this not your standard run of the mill consumer router. Between Gamefuel, and the security options your network will be faster and more secure than with other Linksys and Netgear options in the same price range."
1,Bad access controls and tech support,"As a speedy router, the DGL-4100 is okay. However, creating firewall rules to control my kids' access is terrible. One cannot allow certain protocols, like SMTP to let them get email, while denying other types of access. The manual says if you create a schedule for a computer, access will be denied if access is requested outside of the schedule times; not so, I had to set up a blocking schedule. Tech support is offshore from USA, probably India, and the support techs do not know the product, cannot answer questions, have questionable English skills and my calls were dropped twice. I'm returning the router."
4,"Easy setup, vpn issue, cust svc sucks.","Decided to gig my backbone at home, bought this with the 5 and 8 port gig dlink switches. Easy setup. Ran into a problem though using vpn. It connected w/out issues using TCP, but would not connect using UDP. Tech support was clueless (hence 4 out of 5 stars) till i asked them how to turn IPSEC off for VPN using ALG (helps if you read the manual). They put me on hold till they figured that one out themselves. Once i turned that off, UDP connection works great.Overall, great product, great price."
3,Unhappy teacher,"Wow, I thought this was an awesome poster with a good reminder about how our thoughts can impact out lives. I now find myself having to read it and remind myself that my thoughts are becoming words after seeing the shipping costs for this $3.49 poster is $13.99. Lesson learned. It was also rolled and crinkled as several other reviews have mentioned. Seems like it should have arrived in perfect condition for that much shipping expense."
1,"ROLLED UP, TIED WITH A RUBBER BAND AND PACKED IN A BOX",I could not believe my eyes when the package came. The box looked ok from the outside. When I opened it the poster was wrapped up like a cylinder and held closed (squished) with a rubber band. It was put in the box diagonally and THERE WAS NO PACKING MATERIAL. I have never gotten the poster to lay flat so that I could put it on the wall. The rubber band made a permanent crease. The poster is PERMANENTLY CURLED. NEVER buy a poster from these people.
1,Bent Poster,The poster was not packed very well for shipping and did not arrive without bent corners and wrinkled edges.
3,"Good vitamin, very hard to swallow","Metagenics vitamins were recommended by my doctor. I feel confident about the quality and the make up of the vitamin itself; however, I find it difficult to take the 6-tablet daily dose. I end up taking 2-3/day. I will probably change to a different vitamin as a result."
4,Good for newborns,"If you dont want to use pre-moistioned wipes, then this is a really good option - you just need a bowl of hot water - the wipes hold up well to moisture. The hospital was using these wipes, and I found them here on amazon. a good buy. prevents diaper rash."
5,Excellent,"A brilliant discussion of Toynbee, Spengler & Sorokin. Particularly good on the background to these thinkers."
5,A spectacular piece of hardware,"Before I begin, beware: This watch is NOT a woman's watch!I bought this watch about three years ago while I was down in the Caribbean, and I must say that it was an excellent find. The watch is the perfect size, has considerable weight making it seem like it isn't a piece of junk, and it goes along well with just about anything you wear: dress or casual. I get many compliments on this watch and I must agree with all those who give me the compliments, for this is truly a beautiful and terrific timepiece.The only complaint that I have that it gets gunk in between the links that comprise the wristband--but I say this is worth it considering the price and style that this watch has to offer."
1,Wrong watch,"I bought a womans Fossil and got the men's watch instead, tried to send it back never got a response."
2,"Beautifull, but had problems","This watch is beautiful, but the machine have problems. its delaying some second every hour. sometimes its ok and sometimes it delays.El reloj es bonito, pero se esta atrasando unos segundos. lo hace aveces cada hora o cada dos horas. aveces dura mucho sin atrasarse pero luego lo hace."
1,Awfull transfer,"This is one of the worst transfers I have seen. Just don't bother to buy it. The VHS quality of the picture is much better. It is a shame that the company made no effort whatsoever to credit one of the best western profile, Lee van Cleef."
1,False Advertising,"Supposedly this dvd set is closed captioned and is advertised as such under the format information. The dvd boxes even have the closed captioning symbol. Unfortunately it's not closed captioned. This is a deliberate rip off by the seller ""rightpricedvd"". BUYER BEWARE."
3,Good Transfer,"Ok All John Wayne fans out there. This DVD Collection is a descent transfer compared to the Madacy Studio that came out years ago(which was crap)It is not His color films (True Grit or Sons Of Katie Elder style) But his earlier films likeBlue Steel (1934) 54 min, B&W; onwards.The Studio Pop Flix have gone to great length to Enhance Picture and Sound. There are 2 or 3 parts thru out the collection where it jumps a bit here and there, but it is very minimal. Remember these were made in 1934Sure it's not Blu-Ray Quality but i still admire what they did. (they deserve an oscar).All i can say if you are looking for J.Wayne Classics but not sure which dvd collection to get Give Pop Flix a go collection 1 and 2 is for you."
5,4 Wayne classics,"I had wanted to get Quiet Man, and it was put in with other great movies. For a few bucks more than JUST the movie Quiet Man, you get 3 more movies. Bacjak productions (John Wayne's family) is starting to put some very good stuff together. I watched Quiet Man 3 times and all the extra footage. Hours of great fun."
4,Fun Western to Watch with Boys,"I do not consider myself to be anything of a movie critic, and I do not watch very many movies. These old John Wayne movies are fun to watch with young boys because they are easy to understand, The good and bad are well defined, they have no profanity or sex (some light hugging and kissing), they have a good amount of drama that is not overbearing that is balanced with humor, and the limited amount of violence is not too graphic and seems to be acceptable. Usually, my youngest boy cannot sleep after watching a movie with some violence, but he did not have any problems sleeping after watching one of these movies."
4,Lee is great.,"The four films in this set may not be the best of Lees work,but still His acting can't be beat. The action & gunfights are fun, but if You wanna see Lee at His best try the films done with Eastwood.A Fistful of Dollars (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
4,"Good drive, poor tech support","I've had the drive for over a month now, and have been very happy with it. Only one ""coaster"" but it was my own fault (improper memory settings on my part). Good basic software from Adaptec included, but I do wish there was a discount to upgrade to their Deluxe software. I use it with my iMac DV SE, and no connectivity problems whatsoever. It could benefit from a more stable base, the mini-legs are rather spindly, and the supplied foam stick-ons never stay where they're supposed to stay.Rather unhappy with tech support, who has not responded to my simple queries about a supposed LED light on the front of the unit that is possibly malfunctioning. No returned e-mail, and no returned phone call.Other than that minor problem, I've been happy. Now where's my rebate cheque???"
1,Nicely packaged piece of junk,"I have a brand new G4, OS 9.0.4, the latest version of firewire extension and toast, still I couldn't even get the burner work. The only suggestion the tech support had was to reinstall toast, which of course didn't work. I'm returning it and getting a Yamaha instead."
1,Macally Imediakey failures,"I am using my 3rd Imediakey in as many months. The first one failed within 60 days. I returned it to the manufacturer and received a replacement. The replacement failed within 30 days. This time I encountered resistance from the manufacturer regarding the return. Confused people, long hold times, being transfered from one person to another, etc. I finally had to become forceful to get results. I personally would not buy another Imediakey. Actually, I will never buy another Macally product."
1,Piece-a-crap,"Software never did work right. Downloaded new software. Still didn't recognize the keyboard correctly. Never could program the ""programmable"" keys and only one of the other extra keys worked (ejected the cd like crazy). Finally, when turning on the computer, no keyboard. Tried re-booting several times, still didn't recognize keyboard. Had to get out an old PC keyboard. Save your money, buy an old, used PC keyboard."
5,Very Haunting and Memorable!,"Another hit (at least in the UK) for Alison Moyet. Really. This went to #4 there, but was not marketed here, so didn't show up on our charts. Too bad, because this is true recorded talent. I find very few songs that I can listen to in the top 40 that I can't feel is a little bubble-gum.This song gives the hope that there are still some artists out there that sing to the way they feel, and reaching for originality without trying to sound like everyone else.This is truly a work of art. Alison should be considered one of the most versatile female vocalists today. Mariah and Brittney can't compare to the depth of Alison's soul."
3,"WAIT!, Palm V is worth the upgrade","It's is only a touch smaller, but the Palm V is that much more portable. The IIIis still a little too bulky for the coat pocket (V is invisible in a sport coat) and therefore ends up not there when you need it. This kind of ubiquity and convenience is the key to its value. For me, the III and previous units never were fully adopted because they were ever so slightly to big.This may be less of an issue for women that universally carry either portfolios or handbags."
3,Really bad backlighting,"I'm really upset that my Pilot Personal (four years old) gave up the ghost. The new Palm III HotSynchs faster, but the backlight is REALLY bad. Unless it's DARK, you can't see anything with it on, and the unlit screen is nearly invisible. Oh, well, I guess this is progress."
4,Good Product except Expense Program,"I bought a new Palm IIIe, I can say it is a very good product, I like it very much, but the expense program is not so exciting, as it doesn't allow me to enter the type of expense what I want, it gave only few types, we have to select one of them, most of my expenses looks like ""OTHER"" only because it doesn't allow me to add. Except this limitation it is really awesome. But if we really need what is that expense, we can enter in the space provided for note or vendor. This is only a adjustment. I feel they should modify it."
4,a good beginners product,"the Palm IIIe is a good entry-level hand-held, with some nice features. However, contrary to most other reviews, I find that my Palm drains batteries extremely quickly, allowing for only a couple hours use. Despite this, I still love my palm, and it is far superior to pencil and paper."
3,Great product but glass screen easily breaks.,"I have had the Palm IIIe for almost 3 months. It is truly a great product. My only complaint is that the unit did not survive a 3 foot drop to the floor when it fell out of my top pocket while bending down at work. Even though the cover was closed, the glass broke and now the unit will not operate since it no longer reacts to touching the glass. Palm offers a $100.00 repair policy if it is mailed back to them. The only other way out is to purchase their (1 year 1 time) screen warranty for 30.00. The only problem with this is that you have to wait 30 days after buying the warranty before you can make a claim. Once you use one of these you can't stand to be without it for a day! Other than its fragile nature I do like it."
3,Software to sync with Outlook not included,The Chapure software that is included with other Palm Organizers to synchronize with MS Outlook is not included with this model and has to be bought at extra cost (~$45) from Chapura.
4,Lousy deal,"I became intersted in the Palm platform after reading aboutcompatibility with the MAC. I bought the III e version since itfeatures seems to suffice my needs. To my surprise, the package does not include any connection cable compatible with the MAC ( either serial or USB). But it's available for a few dollars more ( plus the inevitable S&H) as a serial adapter, and for more still as a USB adapter. The Hotsync software for the desktop is free to download from their site. In conclusion , after spending the money to buy it from Amazon.com I have to shell out additional funds to get the iMAC connection ? Not in a hurry .... Sofar, I am unhapy with 3Com but I hope for better after the Palm spinoff...."
2,palm pilot 3 organizer,At first i really liked the palm pilot and it was a help to me but then after a few days it started to malfunction. It used about 2 batteries a day for me. And after a week a droped my briefcase and it crcked and totaally died. I would not recomend this product it is a pain and i did not like it.
2,Lovejoy is Lovejoy but this is not his best work.,"This story has a lot of the things I love about the Lovejoy mysteries, lots of plot twists and unanswered questions. However, this book didn't really seem to build the plot line and just dropped the solution in your lap in the last 20 pages. It was an interesting story of Roman gold in the British Isles but the story tended to drag on. The final scene at the mill was riveting but a little forced"
2,Poor editing,"This collection of articles should have been excellent. However, it seems obvious its editors were not up to the task. Some articles are excellent (e.gr., Law and order in contemporary Japan, Ch. 6; Juvenile Delinquency in the Cross-Cultural Context, Ch.31), others are hardly worth the paper on which they are printed (e.gr., Low crime rates in Bahrain, Ch. 2; Organized crime in South Korea). It seems the editors should have been more demanding instead of, apparently, simply accepting uncritically was was submitted to them.In addition, there are several factual mistakes that were not corrected. For instance,the Seventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention was held in 1985, not 1983 (pag. 17). And the Ninth Congress was held in Cairo, not in Tunis.This is nsot the exception, but rather the rule. So, the book is marred by poor editing. Too bad, because the material contained therein is of great importance."
1,SF written by an eight year old?,"OK OK I confess, I only to got to page 80, and I also have to admit, hard science in SF novels is not that important to me, nor are the mechanics of interstellar spaceflight. But to make the mechanics of space flight, apparently using contemporary science, the main interest of the first 30% of your novel and then be so ludicrously ill informed about it really is an acute embarassment. Its reminiscent of someone who was a techical advisor to star wars. Characterisation and plot development were also weak areas, in fact the novel had no strengths, unless you count the fact the author seemed in a cheerful mood throughout and quite unaware of his own shortcomings. Avoid."
2,Unfortunate mix of ideas and a Mary Sue,"Borrowed Tides is a good title but as a book it is an unfortunate mix of ideas. I'll try not to spoil the book with details, but the science is weak at best and the attempt to get metaphysical seems like a feel-good way to overcome a lack of knowledge of basic physics. For example the so-called ""boomerang effect"" is nothing new for space travel -- Jules Verne predicted it! -- but is presented as something far out. Dr. Levinson's background in media and internet (check his amazon list!)turn the book's ""hero"" into a kind of wishful thinking ""Mary Sue"". It is diffcult to imagine a less likely (or less competent) mission leader! The cover promised me a rip-roaring space adventure, but that's not what I got. Some interesting ideas here, but it doesn't gel."
3,soccer in review3,This video is great because it recaptures plays in important soccer games and records soccer history and styles of play that will become soccer history. I would love to see other unique games like the 1979 WORLD CUP with the Netherlands team (many of whom were killed in a terrible plane cash.) Their style of play was unique and was taught by one of the most innovative soccer coaches of that time.
1,Crap,The cord does connect to my phone but the computer does not register the phone. This cord is pure crap.
1,USB Data Cable It does not connect the equipment Nokia 6225,"My equipment is a Nokia 6225, I have 2 PC with Windows 2000 Professional (SP4) and Windows XP Pro and both don't works . They don't know the device, and with the PC Suite of Nokia it is not connected either.Who can help me ?Thanks."
3,"A Classic among saxophone methods but no ""Bible"".","The Art of Saxophone Playing is one of the first if not THE first scholastic book ever written on the saxophone. It is well done and well documented. Although the saxophone has been in existence for about 150 years, saxophone pedagogy is still in its baby-shoes. There is some information in Larry Teal's book that either no longer holds true, and others that ignore basic laws of physics. The book is worth having, but it should NOT be treated as the ""Bible"" of saxopone playing."
4,A must have book for every saxophone player,A great book with many techniques and practice guidelines. Every sax player should have a copy on shelf for quick reference.
5,THE saxophone book that EVERY player should have!,"There are a number of fundamentals to playing the sax that are uba important and never change. You need to know about them, learn and master them if you want to play well. This is THE book that will set you going in the right direction. Don't be put off by it's age, somethings never change. I recently got back into playing the sax after a 30 year away period. Despite buying a quality Yanagisawa T991 instrument, I struggled for a year and didn't get very far very fast (except grumpy and unpleasant to be around). I'd forgotten a lot of what I was taught back in High School and realised that I wasn't taught everything and what was taught wasn't necessarily correct. So, don't be a schmuk like me and waste a year and money on flash ligatures, mouthpieces and lots of 'faulty' reeds. Save a bundle of $$ and heartache AND GET THIS BOOK!!"
2,Not What I thought,"I was picturing more of a ""learn to play Sax"" book, and this is more of a ""history of the saxophone"". If you're interested in historical facts and lore, this is a good fit for you."
4,Great Reference Book,"This book is wonderful for teaching you how to play, techinces, tools, just all alround a help. But it has little material to play, when teaching a new point it will have about eight or so measures to help you. My big suggestion is to but this book with something you could put your skills to the test with. Otherwords this book is amazing!"
5,Play with artistic technique-best of both worlds!,"This is a great book. Seems it's for the intermediate horn player, but a beginner who is dedicated can also get a lot out of it. It's like a bible of sorts, lots of information and very well put together. Enjoy!"
5,EXCELLENT,"These batteries are excellent for the price,you cant go wrong for what your paying for them.ive used these batteries before and they last a long time."
1,Maxell AAA is weak and doesn't last,"I used one of the four AAA Maxell batteries in a small electric trimmer. I could tell the right away the battery was not powerful. After only using it for a few minutes, the trimmer sounded like it was about to die. I don't know if the batteries are of low quality or were just old, I threw away the packaging but my guess is both."
3,Negative ads cause cynicism,"This book begins with an interesting thesis, which you can read about in detail in chapters 5 and 6. The authors claim that while political advertising in general has the effects of educating the public by informing voters about the candidates and the issues, negative ads can lead to decreased voter participation. Those who remain voters will tend to be more extreme in ideology and less representative of the general public. The concern in this book is that the rise in negative campaigns can subvert the democratic process.Strangely, to get to their main point, you must wade through pretty dry chapters that discuss the methods used to gather data as well as other ways that advertisements affect voter behavior. This may be of great interest to political scientists, but for those with only partial interest, it is probably enough to read the first, fifth, and sixth chapters to get the main gist of the book."
3,Interesting Roman fiction.,"This is a great book for one who wants to understand how the Romans viewed themselves and their history/ancestory. If you are wanting a book on actual early Roaman history, this is not that book. But this is essential reading for learning Roman history."
5,Love and Mystery in the World of Math Nerds,"A highly entertaining, accurate portrait of a particularly bizarre social scene: the real life of mathematicians. Yes, these people tend to be brilliant, but they're also neurotic, romantic, histrionic, and silly. Schogt clearly knows this world intimately -- and gives us just enough information to flesh it out, without going over the non-math head.The Wild Numbers is a darkly comic tale of envy and ambition, set in an environment that (to most of us, anyway) is deeply alien: the hottest of intellectual hothouses. That Shogt pulls this off without once condescending, or lapsing into the standard tropes of the Academic Novel, is a startling feat.It seems counterintuitive, but Schogt is of course right: the math novel should be a thriller. After all, this is a dangerous place. Kissinger once said that the most vicious politics he'd ever witnessed were in academia, because ""the stakes are so small."""
3,"Don't expect ""A Beautiful Mind"" solves ""The DaVinci Code""","It's a quick read along the lines of ""Uncle Petros"" but not as sinister or incisive. Academics can see themselves or their colleagues in the math departments characters; satisfaction with the denouement might relate more to just deserts than the ingenuity of the author."
2,Not that interesting,"I am sorry to say, I didn't like this book. The story is about a mediocre mathematician, struggling in his career, who thought he got a proof to the Wild Number Theorem. However it was flawed. But there is this eccentric old-age student of his who declares that the mathematician stole his proof. The story is not that attractive. Compared to this Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture is far more attractive - in narrative, in thrill, and in mathematics."
4,Immagination and brillient writing combine in an adventure,MacDonald taps into your feelings in brilliant ways as he paints an adventure of and supports the hope of eternity.
1,"A dull, boring fairy story","I was only able to make it all the way through to the end of this monotonous book by sheer determination. I have never seen the merit that others (including C.S. Lewis) have found in it. I was yawning from start to finish. When the end finally came, I borrowed a phrase from Lewis himself to place a moratorium on ever returning to this book for another look: ""Never again."""
2,Not much plot but some nice lyrics,"I was shocked to see that the few reviews for this story were so positive. Not much happens in this story that could have aptly been called _A Walk Through Fairyland"". There is no main 'objective' just the main character (the only character) wandering around meeting people or fairy creatures in a very linear fashion. The ending really didn't have much of a conclusion and the extremely liberal use of quotes was distracting from the story.It would have been much better if the prose was dropped and the songs were just collected. If you like no action, no character development and overwritten description give this book a try."
4,7 out of 10,"Phantastes is a small, yet complex book. I enjoyed this book even though I often felt compelled to put it down. I do not agree completely with Lewis when he says that McDonald's writing style is not his strength. Although the prose is sometimes rough or overly drawn-out in places, I cannot imagine this book being written any other way. Also, this book contains passages that convey great beauty. I recommend this book to all who have finally grown old enough to love fairy tales again."
4,"A difficult, but worthwhile read","After reading ""Surprised by Joy"" by C.S. Lewis and learning of his life changing experience with this book I decided to give it a try. I read the introduction, by Lewis, in which he states plainly that MacDonald's talent lies not in his writing style, but in his story telling ability. As I read through this novel, it became clear to me how true this statement is. I found the main difficulty in reading this book penetrating through the seemlingly average writing to the excellent imagery and story. MacDonald is a romantic author and those who like this style of writing will enjoy this book while Grisham and Clancy fans may find it slow and boring. If you thrive in a book filled with imagery and emotion, but not much action, this book would be an excellent choice."
5,Moral messages through a fantasy journey,"""Though of a noble family, he was poor and prided himself upon the independence that poverty gives; for what will not a man pride himself upon, when he cannot get rid of it?""A fairy tale for adults with moral messages; poetic and imaginative visions. A departure from our materialistic relativist world and into fantasy and the supernatural. Take the time to ingest the meaning behind MacDonald's words. The parallels and influence on C.S. Lewis' writings are striking.The story is about one young mans journey through a fantasy land which was discovered in his fathers desk at home. He travels to a simpler time past, searching for his purpose in this land; fixated on following a beautiful lady.""They who believe in the influences of the stars over the fates of men, are, in feeling at least, nearer to the truth than they who regard the heavenly bodies as related to them merely by a common obedience to an external law.""Wish you wellScott"
3,"Creative, but lacked focus","Phantastes is a fictional story, similar to the stories by CS Lewis, about a person who travels to another world and experiences adventures there.In this case, a young man travels to a Faerie world, where he falls in love and experiences numerous adventures, before returning to his own world.The story was creative, but lacked focus and a well-organized plot."
3,"Tedious, There are better choices for MacDonald","I devoured with relish MacDonald's The Princess and the Goblin.I marveled through his Unspoken Sermons.However, I could not finish Phantases.I need to say that I really wanted to like this book. I was led to MacDonald through C. S. Lewis, and it was listed as one of the most influential books in his life. I've read a lot of antiquated texts, but I could not find much pleasure in this one.The story is a seemingly disconnected series of events in a cliché fairyland (though perhaps it was not so cliché at the time). The main character seems a foil (in that he is very thin and used mainly as a contrast against the fairy world).I never found myself expectant. I was not endeared to any of the characters.I would have scored the book lower, but I did not finish it and I therefore cannot qualify it as a whole."
4,Marvelous Book,"This is my first MacDonald book and it is truly a gem. Some of its stories will be memorable for years to come. It was a bit difficult at times to follow given the older writing style (written in 1858). One should not give up but trod on, because ""great good is coming."" What is probably the most striking thing about this book is the absolutely beautiful use of the English language. Though many credit MacDonald with writing with a Christian bent, I actually felt Phantastes as having a strong pagan/heathen undertone. This, in fact, make more sense given the ""age of spiritual discovery"" which began in mid/late 19thC."
3,Not an Easy Read for Most Modern Readers,"I read that C.S. Lewis said that he had never written a book in which he did not quote George MacDonald. Be that as it were, this not a very readable book. The plot is a long meandering ramble from incident to incident. If you are not a George MacDonald fan, or a literature student studying 19th-century prose, this book will probably disappoint you. Comparatively, Lewis Carroll's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"" and ""Through the Looking Glass"" are easier to read and enjoy, with better cohesion between events. I would recommend getting this book free at a library unless you are really a fan of gothic and romantic fantasy."
5,Absolutely not for beginners,"I have read and used the book, and it is what it claims to be- Power Programming. It is definetely not for the beginners and also not for new ""intermediates"". The author takes the reader from the day-to-day realities of this world into an immense ocean of real programming and shows how an application be finalized. Some information (such as moving to client/server mode) is presented in a very elegant way. My thanks go to both the author and the publishers."
2,Terribly disappointing!,"I gave up on this book after going through the first 6 chapters. The writing style is terrible. The book is not designed to teach rather dumps out information in a disorganized fashion.You could go through this book, cover to cover, and still be unable to handle a simple Access project. It's a waste of money."
4,Very funny book,"For everyone who dreams of alien contact and how great it would be, there is ""First Contract."" Aliens arrive and the economy crashes almost overnight. A brilliant premise, executed well. He knows what he's talking about, too. You aren't just told that things went to pot. You see why, and you don't get bored in the process. A thoroughly enjoyable book. It made for great for reading at the beach."
3,"It's a bit wacko, but a good read","It's not so much about science fiction. It's really kind of wacko... But, it's a really good read.All Earth's business is knocked flat when the Aliens arrive with light-years better technology. How will our hero recover?The characters and dialogue are familiar, and the crazy story shows our current world from a different point of view. Globalization. Third world reactions to the Europeans arriving. Staying alive. Even our current president is clearly depicted.Enjoy."
2,save your money,"I believe that mushrooms need to be cleaned prior to use. I have always used a paper towel, in an attempt to not create a soggy mess with my mushrooms. This brush seemed the perfect environment-friendly option-but no.In my opinion, it tears the surface or, if used with less pressure, simply does nothing. Great!On stronger-skined mushrooms, like portabellas, it is acceptable-but they really don't usually need much cleaning,so:Back to the paper towels."
4,History of Brazil,Written 15 years ago. Not up to date. A lot has happened in the past 15 years including the taming of inflation and the election of left leaning presidents.
2,Reads like a collection of disparate essays,"While it was informative, overall the book was more like a collection of different essays rather than a coherent and well edited whole. It also felt out-of-date, even though it was published in 1998. I also think the first person perspective wasn't helpful."
3,"Excellent book, but makes some assumptions about the reader","An excellent overview of Brazillian history, culture, and ethnicity and stands as a decent introduction to the subject (I was a reader with almost no knowledge of the country.) However, probably should not be the FIRST book you read, as it makes certain assumptions about terms and concepts the reader knows. For example, the term ""paulista"" is used several times and never defined. Likewise, a number of political leaders are mentioned without their titles or explicit definition of their roles.Still, overall a good read and useful for a critical reader willing to spend time with it to puzzle out the occasional assumption or misstep."
2,Incomplete book for the 70-228 exam,"I started studying for the exam with this book and I noticed that this book has poor information for the following areas:ClusteringDTS packagesStored procedures, triggers, views.I recommend to look for the 70-229 training book to complement to this one and study the books online.This book contains useful information for the following areas:InstallationUpgradesReplications"
1,Do not bother,"This book is a joke. It is poorly written, the grammar is crazy and wrong, and it dwells too much on events that are not important (click next, and click next, then click ok, and then next...). You would be well-advised to read another book, as well as BOL, before attempting 70-228.Waste of money!"
2,Not much help,"This book is ok to get an overview of basics. I bought the Transcenders after reading this book to see where I was at. This book covers NOTHING that is on the Transcenders, nor anything that is on the test engine that comes with the book. I have now read this almost twice, and I have come away with tons more knowledge from BOL. If you plan to use this for the certification exam, be prepared to read most of BOL to finish your training. Most of the time MS Press has done a good job with their training books and I have never really needed more, but this is definitely the exception to the rule."
2,Two Stars,"This book focuses on the lifeless details, and really lifeless exercises. That makes it hard to stay awake. There is not a lot of meat. You could not use it for a reference, too much filler and makes the assumption of no particular expertise by the reader. It leads the reader in the exercises and the accompanying CD to believe that the test is about memorization of fine details that would take years to memorize. I have taken a half dozen certifications, they are not about memorizing details. I do not expect to take the certification exam after plodding through this book. This book is pretty much the way other Microsoft Press books are written, some may be happy with that, but I find they kill my interest."
2,nowhere near enough,"Supplemental material is absolutely required. The book provides relatively scant information on what appear to be the most heavily weighted exam areas. The exercises don't really prepare you for the exam since the exam questions focus on abstract/theoretical concepts as opposed to practical application in realistic scenarios. The study test questions are a pretty good inidcator of the difficulty of the questions on the exam, but there are at least a few errors; one of the more glaring ones tells you one thing in the pre-question objectives section, another thing in what is supposedly the correct answer to the question, and then BOL completely contradicts both of those. All in all, it is a pretty sad effort especially considering it is from the same company that produces the software in question."
4,A good place to start,"I have taken 6 of 7 exams for MCSE. I agree with the previous review that this is a very difficult exam. I doubt that any one book will do it for you on this one unless you have a lot of hands on experience.The book covers all the basics but you must also know the following that this book does NOT cover:1. Know your T-SQL very well.2. Know all about indexes and how they affect performance.3. Know some about db design, keys etc.4. Know how to diagnose poor query performance.Good Luck"
1,Doesn't scratch the surface,The book was well organized but did not even scratch the surface of any technical topic. Most of the info was on how to click on the user interface. The labs are for beginners and do not prepare you for real adminitrtion. This is a beginners book at best. Most of the material in the book was not on the Cert test. This book will not help anyone preparing for MCSE.
5,great filter,I ordered this product for a 1999 Honda Accord. This product fit perfectly into my car and I regret not buying more of them; prices going up now.
2,Complete Waste of Time,"I rarely write reviews, but feel compelled to do so with this book so that I might prevent other people from wasting their time as I have. A lot of people have criticised this book for its lack of more sophisticated material. Putting that aside, the book is very poor on the things it does cover.This book is written in a very confusing style. There is no didactic elegance and it is hard to acquire a clear understanding of the subject matter. The writers seem to assume that their readers have no understanding of statistics. Consequently, they present results without proofs or even solid mathematical intution. The net result is that the reader is left utterly confused.Regardless of your grasp of maths, this book will leave you confused. Stay away."
1,This book is TOTALLY USELESS,"I work as a stockbroker & currently study for an MBA at one of the business schools in New York. I was looking for an additional text on Finance to supplement my required reading list. I came across this book at a local bookstore last week & was quite impressed with the title...As I flipped through, I found nothing interesting and of benefit for my MBA... How could this kind of low-rate work ever make it to the shelf?What a piece of JUNK!"
2,Unnecessarily Complex,Author devotes 2 pages to mathematically prove & philosophically justify that a manager should chose the highest NPV project before chosing the next highest NPV project. Such logic continues ad infinitum throughout the 800+ page text. Time for 3rd Ed.
1,Missed the mark! Poor coverage of contemporary issues...,"This text is just below par for MBA / CFA or professional use. The quality of research is very poor. I almost bought this book recently but changed my mind instead for Brigham's ""Intermediate Financial Management"".Compared to other finance texts I've used before such Reilly's ""Investment Analysis & Portfolio Mgt."" or Chew's ""New Corporate Finance"", Grinblatt's text is way way behind and offers nothing new and of value to my research & professional everyday use....DON'T BUY this lousy book!"
4,Good Material But Pretty Dry,Not a book for the casual reader or the beginner. It's a great reference for advanced corporate finance but it's a little difficult to understand.
4,"Good for shelf reference, bad for class","I bought this for a corporate financial policy at the Ross School of Business (Michigan). I read through the assigned chapters during the first couple of classes, but a lot of it was directly overlapping what we talked about in class. It is a good book with easy to understand explanations. If the choice was to use it as a shelf reference it is definitely a buy. I know I will use it after I graduate at my next job. However, if the purpose is just to read it for class and you have a good professor or strong grasp on the material, it is just extra money down the drain."
2,not worth even the new low price,this mouse doesn't track well at all - is very jumpy - and doesn't glide smoothly even on a smooth surface. I bought it as a replacement for my icemouse mini (no longer available) and this one is also a bit high for my tiny hands.
3,Mikey Mouse watch set,"The set is nice, but I obviously misread the details of the set. I ordered it for my 4 year old grandson (thought I could begin teaching him to tell time) because he loves Mikey Mouse, but the watch face does not have any numbers."
5,Excellent resource for all health care providers!,"The entire ""5 minute consult"" series is incredible. Easy to use and up to date ... you can't ask for much more than that in today's chaotic health care arena. Thanks to Lippincott for publishing such a necessary yet accurate product."
2,Teenage fantasy,"The writing is technically competent. The story is the problem.I don't know how old Alison Baird is, but this book certainly reads as though it were written by a 16-year-old girl. There is little about the story that can be called original; even the surprise twist at the end is perfectly obvious by a third of the way through. We are given a hodge-podge of poorly-blended elements that, the competency of the writing excepted, closely resembles teenage fan fiction. Magic stones, dragon riding, hidden destinies, a token black character -- and, of course, the certainty of two more volumes to come.This book is sure to appeal to a great many teenagers. Grown-ups may find it tedious."
1,Confusing and Dissappointing,"I'm sorry to say, I didn't make it through the entire book. I got lost in all the Vale's, Abbotts, and priests, and a new type of religion around every corner. Ana was a hunched over witch of the forest in one chapter, living in a cave and speaking cryptically. The next chapter, she was a sweet grandmother who lived in the basement of the church, and spoke directly, plainly, and gently healed all the sick, while engaging in secret rituals, a'la Da Vinci Code Priory of Sion. After that, I had no idea how to take her. The good and evil religions were difficult to differ, and the at first evil Jamon is proved to be a turncoat brought to the good side in about two paragraphs .There are a plethora of excellent fantasy books. I can't recommend this as one of them."
4,Superb collection of poetry and fiction!,"BLUE MESA REVIEW #6 doesn't pull any punches. It begins with a great dramatic monologue dedicated to the memory of Cesar Chavez. This is a special issue because it is a tribute to Rudolfo Anaya, the man responsible for the existence of the magazine. He has helped assemble a marvelous collection of poetry and prose from writers more interested in The Other than the Self. These selfless writers challenge the status quo with emotional fireworks. I would say this issue is probably the finest collection of voices to come out of the west in quite a while."
3,Only Hardcore Buffett Fans Need Apply,"A fun CD with a mix of some of Jimmy's early song style. A long way from the island-hopping, beach music that made him famous. Similar albums would include: High Cumberland Jubilee, Down To Earth, or Before The Beach. Classic singer/songwriter/folk fans MIGHT also find something here for their tastes. Others would probably be better served looking elsewhere for entertainment."

5,Loved the real life horse stickers!,Purchased for my grandaughter and was a great way to keep her busy during a long road trip! I loved the real life pictures and variety.
4,Horse sticker book.,"This sticker book was perfect or my 6 yr old horse loving daughter. She loves it. I have to admit though, there were a few horse stckers that did not match up to any spots in the book.... Even I was stumped!!"
2,Not worth the money!,"Got this expecting many pages of stickers, but its kind of pathedic looking. Afraid to give this to my daughter for her birthday since it looks cheap and it wasn't cheap price!"
2,Stickers Not Reusable,"Both copies of this book I bought have stickers that, once removed from the book, will not stick back to their sticker sheets. Instead they just curl up, fall off, and get ""crunched"" or lost. Also, stickers need a razor blade to remove from the book or they crinkle. Great concept and nice facts and stickers but not really ""reusable"" as the cover says."
3,Left me wanting more,"This book was great for the graphics and stickers however it was a bit thin on the number of pages there were to enjoy. The look made me feel I was going to get a thicker book than what came. Otherwise, the photos were nice."
5,A Surprise and a Challenge!,"The Myth of ability at first sounds somewhat grandiose. Does it really mean that I could become a concert pianist,or atop surgeon? What about a basketball player. But once I got I to this book I was charmed by the challenge of learning to teach mathematics by a system that guaranteed success, challenged students with solvable problems, and steadily builds on a study reliable platform. Thank you John. You have given all of us the challenge to break down any activity that we are teaching to simple steps that guarantee success, and naturally progress to something more challenging"
3,A thoughtful study,"This is a ""must read"" for any church that is beginning to plan for building any addition. It is helpful to answer the questions that the authors present to us before we assume that we know why we are building and what we can expect to accomplish through the building project."
3,master of orion 2,It is okay but I realy want to edit star lane connections and have more flexability in race stats. But is is a good game over all It gave me a week or more worth of fun and I like to keep it in my game archive of old cooler games.
2,Won't Play on a SONY DVD PLayer,"Mary Black Live was a very expensive DVD in purchase price. Unfortunately its a Region 3 disc and will NOT play on my new SONY DVD Player.However it will play on my Windows XP Computer. I have found no way to remove the Region Code. Therefore I can not use my HD TV and home theater sound with this disc.And that is a bummer.TimHollywood, FL."
5,Keeps its configuration,"I first bought this router because of it's price. I had imagined that it would operate like any other router which includes a reconfiguration every now and then. I've had this router for two months now and it has a good strong signal in my 1600 square foot home. Even when I move my laptop to the other side of the house and my connection is down to two bars, the connection speeds stays fast.As far as gaming; this is the router to have. The router configures the proper ports to open on its on when a game is started. It also works for downloading programs like Utorrent. Once the ports are not needed anymore, the router closes the ports.For advanced users, this router is for you also. The web interface is fast and friendly but powerful. Once all the configurations are made, you will be able to save your configuration to your computer just in case you router loses its configuration."
4,A Great Router That Does What Its Suppose To Do,"I had no problem setting up the router. I plugged it in, powered it up and I connected to the Internet with no problems. My 2 Xbox 360s are running great along with my PCs and laptops. The only issue I had was with my HP AIO 7310 printer. Each time I turned it on I had to reset the router. I called D-Link Tech Support (verify helpful) and changed the routers settings to manually set up the IP address and other network information for the AIO. Since this was done I've had no problems."
4,A gamers must buy.,"I've gone through several routers trying to find one that not only helped connect my gaming systems and computers to the internet, but was able to provide top speed without disconnection or lag. My last Linksys router did just that. The 108G Gaming Router runs flawless and gives me a smooth, fast connection. I especially like how it prioritizes my PS3 and XBox 360 connections over my PC ensuring the top speed is maintained. This technology is called ""Gamefuel"". Connection hardwired and wireless devices was easy through the wizard and there are plenty of advanced features such as for those who want to run virtual servers, MAC filtering, port forwarding, or advanced security features. This is a great router and I would recommend it to any gamer out there with multiple devices requiring internet connections."
5,Great router,"This is a great router w/ a gigabit switch and many advanced features such as WPA2 and RADIUS server support, protocol prioritization and more."
5,"Excellent router, very stable wireless performance","I have a PS3, 2 laptops and a desktop which leverages the wireless b & g, 100 MBs & 1 Gigbit wired connections. In short it performs perfectly, can't ask for more, the reason I'm posting this review is that I realized how stable is it, after attempting to upgrade to another DLink router that incorporated Wireless n but turned to be a disaster."
5,Long Live DGL-4300,"Finally showing/showed it's age after a long life. Wasn't the strongest signal (4/3 bars in Master Bedroom), but it was consistent (not one drop until the end) and served me well. RIP!!!Thank you D-Link for a wonderful product."
4,Good product,"Had this router for 5+ years. It just died last week and during the router's life, I've had no problems with it. As for the speed, I played online on laptop (killing floor) and it held up. Signal isn't that strong down the basement. Overall, good solid product."
3,Wish it had support,"First, I'm not a networking guru and the main purpose for the router was a better gaming experience by reducing the broadband bottleneck created by the older router. The main problem with this router is it is no longer supported by D-Link. So, I bought a $170 gaming router that isn't supported by the company. What a bummer! It would be nice if Amazon would set a policy with electronics to only allow supported equipment to be sold on the site. Yes, I should have done better research and visited the D-link website prior to purchase. But all the reviews on the product were great and I went for it. Lesson learned! Do yourselves a favor and make sure the product is supported."
2,"Hung in there, but clunky, error-prone","Not so great, support not that great. Contivity VPN didn't work until I reconfigured the router. After that, the error rate and dropped packets were astronomical. Support had nothing for me to troubleshoot, except a new way to scratch my head. Wireless coverage in my two story house was average, and my rather robust wired home network (10 PC, 2 Mac, network printer, VOIP phone, Tivo) just clunked along.I personally checked all wired connections for continuity, and even installed gigabit D-Link switches. This thing did NOT do a very solid job of routing data.After two years, the thing finally died. I reinstalled my old D-Link 2.4 wireless router, and the network is as happy as it ever was.BTW, this is old technology. Don't buy it, even with the rebate. The last firmware update is also a couple of years old."
4,A little tricky with dsl setup,Great product and great shipping. A little tricky when connecting to dsl though but you have to remove the companion software after setting up your account or else you will not have a usable connection. They do state this in the instructions and on their website.
1,Think twice before buying this router,"I bought this product based on all great reviews it got. However, I had to return it because of its terrible quality. First of all, installed firmware (version 1.7) is buggy. It can't load one of the setup pages due to an error in Java script. Router notifies you that there's a newer version 1.8 available, but when you go to a manufacturer's web page it's not there. Apparently it's been taken out without any notice because of being so broken! So, because of this error I was unable to change my internal LAN speed from 10Mb/s (default setting) to 100Ms/s.Furthermore, buggy firmware is not the worst problem with this router. It has some hardware problems as well, causing it to drop packets (I was only using wired connection, so it's not caused by problems with wireless network). Network error rate (according to router's statistics page) is over 1%. This is really unacceptable and greatly affects router's performance.Think twice before buying this product."
5,Beats Netgear hands down,"I bought this to replace my fairly new Netgear hardware. Netgear seems to have issues with their wireless routers requiring frequent reboots. I saw this behavior with mine. I was pleasently surprised with the performance of the DLink. It was easy to setup and customize (I'm a computer geek, so that may have helped), and the configs are easy to save.The real surprise came when my Netgear 108mbps cards actually synced up at 108 with the DLink! I was prepared to replace my existing Netgear cards gradually, but that won't be necessary now! So far, this router has been rock solid."
5,What a relief,"Had Belkin PRE-N for 2 mothts. It is long shooter. Great range. But not stable. Now have DGL-4300 for 4 days: range, of course, is not that great. Speed: in par or somewhat better. And: NO PROBLEM. No rebooting, restarting, re-initializing,etc. For wired connection extra benefit - gigabit hub. So, happy man again. My advice: if range is not concern, if you are looking for workhorse, to avoid frustration, go with this one!"
5,Great router,I have had this router for a few months now. It works great. Handles alot and I mean alot of connections and does not slow down. I have had to reset it a total of three times since I bought it in August 2006. Those resets were for internet problems... I suspect my internet went down and that messed up the router.
4,Programmable,"I like this router because it's programmable, detailed information on exactly how to program evry little thing in it is a bit scarce. I was expecting it to noticably give my VoIP more bandwidth but since I have to plug the VoIP in front of the router I don't think it helps it at all. Overall, it's a good product."
1,Could not get it to work wirelessly,"Now, it is used as a wired router in the house. I gave up on setting the router to work with my laptop after several days of struggle. Unfortunately, I was out on a long vacation when the thing arrived, and so could not return it in time.A waste of money this, atleast for me."
1,Less then meets the eye,"I purchased my DGL-4300 to replace my DI-614+, only to discover it dosen't support PPTP connections. After waiting two months, D-Link finaly released an upgrade that enabled PPTP connections.When trying to use the router, I kept getting disconected from the net, every time I try to use a program that transfers high volumes of data, like video confrencing or on-line gaming. Every time I contacted D-link, they didn't know what the story was. After a long time, they finally said they have no idea what the problem is, and blamed other factors.The router's firewall kept dropping packets without any reason, and kept causing the connection to reset. This problem, and others, when searched on the web, turn up often enough but without a solution."
5,Awesome!,This is one outstanding router. Easy to set up and extremely efficient in utilizing the cable modem bandwidth. I bought this after comparing router performances at www.tomshardware.com and am extremely happy with it.
3,Good product poor support,"My experience is not as good as the majority of other reviewers. The product was difficult to install and the first rep was unhelpful. Once it became clear that he was not able to help with the problem, he hanged up... The second call was more successful albeit the critical help was provided from the DSL provider. The problem turned out to be that the DSL model already had router functions that had to be disabled. Now the router works well."
1,The rebate experience is disastrous,I bought this D-Link wireless router and adapter together in February and expected $50 rebate from them. I received a card from them today saying they did not receive the UPC symbols for both products.I taped the UPC symbols to the rebate form and made a copy before I sent them out. I insisted that they lost the UPC symbols to no avail. I think their processing staff was not very careful. They also misspelled part of my name.I am suprised to find many bad rebate experiences with D-link on the Internet. I will write a letter to the company to complaint formally.
2,Not what I was expecting,"I would not recommend purchasing this product, unless you have very few people using the internet or you are using this as an access point. For me personally, I have multiple people/computers/gaming systems/phones connected, so the router was pretty slow. Also, the router would constantly drop its signal...it is extremely annoying to unplug and plug back in at least once or twice a day...will not recommend this router (or brand) to anyone in the future...go Cisco/Linksys!"
5,"A PBS ""Read Between the Lions"" discovery.","I happened to catch an episode of PBS's Read Between the Lions, which highlighted this book. I thought it was cute and picked up a paperback version at the bookstore when my daughter was still a baby. My daughter loved it. It was one of those books that ended up being a repeat bedtime book and she still enjoys it today. Of course, the paperback version started to wear and tear, so I went to Amazon to find it in hard cover. We will keep the book until she has kids of her own to read it to."
5,Pigs,One of my favorite fun books to read to my grandchildren. Read with inflection and you will get lots of giggles.
4,If you have teens then this is the book for them!,Got teens? Problems with Boredom? Solve it by buying this book. Your teenager will thank you. This book is expertly written for the teenager. The easy to follow steps are perfect for your teenager. The projects are very simple and easy for twelve year olds and up to follow. My teenager and her friends enjoyed the book and projects. This book will help keep the winter boredom blues away. A must have book for any teen library.
4,Good Intro to Caning,"As newbie clayers, my daughter (9) and I have enjoyed this book together. While it is mostly about the construction of canes to get various effects, syndee holt makes it easy to understand (with humor!) and the photographs help immensely. We also got better info on basics like conditioning the clay & best methods for baking than from other resources we've used, and the gallery of projects is really firing our creative imaginations."
4,You go girl,Great''''. I think Sue Heaser writes great books. Good tips and easy to follow directions.
4,heavy duty,"ive owned a few expanders over the years, mostly used to remove crimps left behind from clamps. anyone who turns wrenches for a living knows what im talking about, this expander should last me a long time, i grease it well and clean it and have royally beat it up, dont expect to be swedging cold stainless pipes to fit together, but it will expand standard pipe like butter, i ordered a few adapters to go up to 3 1/2"" , ive used them on stainless , take care of it, clean it and grease it well. i prefer to use heavy synthetic bearing grease vs. antiseize, the antiseize turns to soup under the heat when you are driving it with an impact and im not sure the bearing will take the heat using antizeize. i also clean and PACK the bearing after each use. ive owned about 12 expanders over the years, all of which either stripped or exploded, this has a nice heavy greasable bearing. wish i had this 15 years ago. im quite happy with it"
2,Does not fit 1 5/8 pipe!,"Whilst the tool looks robust and better than any other of the same type (and I have tried a few), it does not fit 1 5/8"" pipe. It too large and hence unfortunately useless for my project."
3,it's a brush,"Nothing speacial. It works. A little stiffer than I would want. I just got a white one. My children were a little disapointed, they wanted a blue, pink, or some fun color."
4,"Very basic, works great!","Love this! It is pretty basic but does the trick. works fab on my long, wavy, med-thick hair. Comes in fun colors too! This is a medium sized brush."
2,Good on flavor; Poor on detail,"I didn't care for this book much.Whether it is poor editing, or poor understanding of the subject, I found it confusing and vague whenever it got anywhere near technical detail. For example the book seems not to understand the fairly fundamental difference between a subway car and a subway train.On the other hand, if you like good, flavorful tabloid writing, you will like the accident descriptions with their descriptions of the screams and groans of the injured."
3,Poor quality but I like the concept....,"I like the concept of the under the cabinet storage unit, but the quality of the plastic and construction is very poor. First, I ordered two units, one of the plastic latches was broken right out of the box, the second unit's latch was so hard to open I have to use pliers to pinch the latch to open it!!Just like the other reviewers, I had a hard time installing the units under the cabinets. Once I removed the sliding arms, I had more room to work.This under cabinet storage unit would be fantastic if the makers would put a little more effort into the quality of materials and not make it so cheaply made.I would not waste my money on these storage units if I had known the poor quality of them."
3,not in my kitchen...,"Bought this to make a cell phone charging station. Decided it wasn't right for my kitchen, but I'm excited to put it in our camper for spices, etc. - great concept!"
4,"Unfortunately, the best book on Wyatt","I say this book is ""unfortunately"" the best book on Wyatt Earp because it's really a popular coffee table kind of thing and not a serious work of scholarship but at least it attempts to be objective, gets most of the facts right and is a lot of fun."
3,I was expecting more.,"I saw Jean-Pierre on Home Matters. He owns a resturant and is a professional cook. I bought his book expecting some very good tasting dishes. I tried a mushroom and a potatoe dish, and they were ok. I also made the chicken dish I saw him cook on Home Matters. I followed the recipe to the best of my ability, but it was just an average tasting dish. I see everyone else gave him good reviews, maybe its me buying bad wine. Most of his recipies calls for wine, and I don't know anything about wine. From his website I got a pasta recipe, which I liked. I also got a rissoto<sp> rice recipe from his website which I liked."
3,I did not find the book all that good,"I tried some of the recipies, like the rice/mushroom and pasta dishes on Jean-Pierre website, they were good/average meals. I bought his book and tried the chicken in wine dish that was suppose to be the best recipe in the whole book, it was an average dish. I also baked the mushroom dish and a potatoe dish found in the book, both were average tasting. I notice he uses wine in most of his recipies and I don't know anything about wine. I tried to follow the recipies to the best of my ability, but I'm just an average home cook."
4,WHERE'S THE DVD?!?!?!?!?!?!,Only the little people have VHS! C'mon and bring this camp classic to the 21st Century!
2,Incredibly small & light weight,"I recently spent a weekend at Lake Conasauga in Northern Georgia and took this bag along because I was sold on its weight. Extremely small and light. I do like that. Unfortuately, when temperatures dipped into the mid to low 50s, I found myself somewhat chilled the entire evening. It's only 50+ Temp, so it could be understandable, but I would only advise this bag if you're summer camping. I will say, however, that if you're looking for an inexpensive ultra-lite bag for warmer climates, this is definatly the way to go."
5,"Bobby Susser Has Become Synonymous With ""Wiggle Wiggle""","The young children in our day camps start out everyday with the songs, exercises, and movements on this CD. We have found it to be the best CD for young kids to exercise to. Bobby Susser has become synonymous with ""Wiggle Wiggle"", as well as having written the finest, most catchy, instructive songs that get our kids moving and start their day in a very healthy and positive way. He is to be commended."
2,disappointing,"Well, if you have nothing better to do, you can read this book. However, if your looking for content, strong writing, and substantial material from either chemical or meteorological perspectives, take your money and your time elsewhere. The book is not much more than bare bones lectures, and uninspiring ones at that. Having worked, studied and taught in atmospheric science, I expected more. Overall a disappointing text. Quality on the delivery and shipping from Amazon though."
5,"Dependable mouse, it even beats the optical version","This is a very good 3-button scroll wheel USB mouse. It's the old-fashioned rubber ball kind, but seems to require less frequent cleaning. Its shape is the same as the MacAlly optical mouse. I have one of each and have to say this old-fashioned mouse is slightly more reliable. I sometimes get strange results with the optical mouse, which is picky about your mouse pad or surface. In contrast, this one works perfectly on foam pads, formica, or wood tabletops and you get the physical feedback that is absent in the optical variety.The Mac version of iSweetnet works fine on my Windows PC with no special software (also on OS X). The default acceleration and speed seem familiar. My biggest annoyance with mice is that some cause me to grip them tightly while trying to stop the mouse from giving too much movement when a very small (1-pixel) move is needed. The iSweetnet works well out-of-the-box for both very fine and rapid movements."
4,about the PSB album pop art..........,"it is a good collection of all the good tunes of pet shop boys....it is a potected CD which comes with the package. A recommended collection those whopm are interested in this genre of music.N/B: The true illicit confession film should have the very first longer sex scene, the rest of the scene are longer and the pimp whom employ one woman to work in his lap dance club where later there is a sex scene etc.Review by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon KahDirector 'lou ye' - Ang Poon Kah for film summer palace."
3,price over $1500 is higher than the real market-value now,"If the selling price could be down to $1350,I will take it right now or I,ll keep waiting."
3,an exhaustive but not too accurate book,"lp's book on india is a must for westerners travelling for the first time to india. the book covers everything a tourist needs to know - including (and this is stressed all too often) all the negative things about india. as an indian, i find the book not very accurate, and at times misleading. but it certainly caters to the holier-than-thou attitude of most tourists from usa and some western europian countries who visit india - more often than not to find faults than appreciate a different culture!"
1,Ever More of Just the Same Tired Old Tripe,"It doesn't seem to matter how many times the truth about Taxil's articles and the Papacy's Oath Against Modernism are debunked. Some people will believe anything in print that confirms their own beliefs.This book is nothing more than a rehash of the old, old rants and tirades.(I didn't want to give it even one star, but I did not have that option!)"
3,good book,"my grandchildren love books, but like good pictures whilelistening to the story, so they love this book"
2,nothing special,I was looking for a book with recipes that could be used in acommercial bakery.This did not have the type of recipes that I needed.syanovich@hotmail.com
2,"Missing, Clumsy","I loved Streetwise Manhattan so I bought this. What a disapointment! The main strength of Streetwise is the integration of Streets and Subways. But Streetwise Brooklyn actually leaves off some subway stations! Ever try to mark up a laminated map to add a stop? Doesn't work, and neither does this map. And the north/south split just doesn't work for Brooklyn. Also, the trains to Brooklyn changed when the Manhattan bridge re-opened to subway traffic, so where's a new edition? Do get the Manhattan version, it's complete and works great, but skip Brooklyn."
1,Streetwise Brooklyn,This map was not at all helpful. The text is small. It splits the borough in half vertically with one half on one side and the other half on the flip side of the map. I have found other maps that are much more user-friendly especially for individuals who are not very familiar with Brooklyn.
5,Nice Cover,This cover seems to be very well made. It covers the bike completely and has been through a downpour successfully.
1,"Maybe a smolder, but not Burning Bright in my opinion","I picked this up with high hopes of a book as good as The Girl with the Pearl Earring, and I was disappointed. For a novel set in the 1790's, there were no clues that transported me to that time, and the whole book lacked any 'umph' ... I completely missed the point about William Blake as he was never made out to be a major player in the book and it seemed more of a story of childhood self discovery between Jem and Maggie. The back cover of the book promised so much that was not delivered that I kept rereading it to see if it could give me clues as to what I was waiting for. Not a good book."
2,Maybe - not so much,"I did not love this book - I loved ""Girl with Pearl Earring"" because it was well researched - provided good detail on the historical period and life of the artist Rembrandt van Rijn. This story - while mildly amusing, lacks all of what made ""...Pearl Earring"" interesting. The historic period detail was lacking, there was little information actually about William Blake (In fact, he was more of a supporting character who was trying desperately to be a lead character, but wasn't really making it.), and I did not find the lives of the main characters all that engaging. If you have limited reading time,I recommend you pass on this one."
2,A Pale Watercolor/Far from a Poem,"Not worth the time. There is little plot or story line other than the author tries to paint a word picture of rural England and London in Blake's time, but ends up with a lot of fog and Blake a dim drab shadow in the background. The author never seems to grasp the genius and passion of Blake's poetry or the depth of his involvement and horror over in the collaterial damage that tortured so many craftsmen and those rural people who tilled the land -- all caught in the maw of the English Industrial Revolution and the bloddy undertow from the French Revolution. If you are interested in Blake and the world in which he lived, it is better to spend your time and money on Jacob Bronowski's book: A Man Withjout a Mask : William Blake 1757 - 1827 -- now in used book sections."
5,A Well-Researched and Altogether Enchanting Novel,"I had read all four of Tracy Chevalier's previous novels prior to picking this up. I found Girl with a Pearl Earring superb, The Lady and the Unicorn quite good, The Virgin Blue plain weird, and Falling Angels unreadable. I didn't know what to expect here. I'm happy to say that I enjoyed Burning Bright immensely.Several reviewers have commented that this novel's characters are two-dimensional. I don't disagree with them. I find Jem and Maggie, however, absolutely captivating, and I found myself pulled along from page to page by the writing.It's also worth mentioning that the research for this novel is, as far as I can tell, superb. The most easily verified example is the geography; I can find nearly all the streets and the place names on maps (and in the right places), and I strongly suspect that the ones that I can't find have changed names since the late eighteenth century."
4,A wonderful read,"I really enjoyed this Tracy Chevalier book - I loved the period of time it was set as well as the Lambeth area of London! Having William Blake as a next door neighbor to the main characters was an excellant way to inject some historical accuracy to the story - and the character development, wonderful! I felt fully connected with Jem and Maisie and all the Kellaways, and I really like the character of Maggie Butterfield! Chevalier also included another 'real life' character, the circus owner Philip Astley. I hated for the story to end, it captivated me so. Now, days after I've finished reading this story, my mind will wander and I find myself thinking about the characters and what will happen next!I would highly recomment this book to anyone who like historical fiction."
3,"Not her best, but still a good read","I really do enjoy reading Tracy Chevalier, but must say this one isn't her best. I kept waiting for something really to happen, but it never did. The end was a bit stale. Certainly not up to her usual standards. However, having said all this, it was still an enjoyable read."
2,An unremarkable read not about Blake,"I should probably preface this by saying I'm not a fan of Tracy Chevalier. She seems determined to follow a trend (over I dare to hope) of including historical figures in her narrative in order to classify it as true Historical Fiction. It's an unnecessary contrivance. I read this hoping to learn something about Blake. He's in it. It's not about him. In fact I'm not sure what it was about. There seemed to be no resolution to any of the conflicts set forth. Perhaps I'm just having trouble remembering, what was, for me, an unremarkable read. All the key figures walk onto the screen with hardly anything memorable about them, they have their say, engage in their respective struggles, then walk away again without seeming to have accomplished anything but to have gotten themselves into finer messes than they were to begin with. I'm a fairly astute reader. If there was a point, I didn't get it."
2,Story falls flat,"I finished this book quickly, it held my attention well enough but I kept waiting for the plot to ""kick in"" and it never did. The ending was a complete let down. In fact, after I read the book, I kept wondering what the point of the book was-it really wasn't about William Blake who was portrayed as more of a backdrop. It just seemed to be a a year's chronicle of a small section of neighbors in London preceding the French Revolution. Other than Maggie, the characters were flat and somewhat undeveloped...you wanted to know and care about them, but it just never happened. Extremely disappointing book from a very good writer."
2,Disappointed,"I've read all of her books and this was disappointing. Normally, I can't put them down, but this took awhile to get through. It seemed to drag in the middle and the end was predictable. The language was confusing many times and parts weren't explained well, which I've never had a problem with in previous books. Overall, not my favorite one by her."
1,Not Bright Enough,"This is one of my favorite authors. I could hardly wait to open Burning Bright and get lost in London of the 1700's. Well, lost I got! Each page was more and more boring. I read 3/4th of the book and donated it to the library. After reading the other reviews I am glad I didnt finish the book and be completely disappointed with the weak ending."
2,Nothing Like Girl With a Pearl Earring,"After readingGirl with a Pearl EarringI picked up ""Burning Bright"" and was very let down. I agree with other reviewers, the characters are too emphasized where William Blake is too much of a vague reference, almost as if Tracy Chevalier was afraid to assign him dialogue in case she be proved wrong. I truly didn't care for any of the characters and was always hoping some*thing* would happen. There was no climatic ending, it fizzled out and a nice bow tied things up. It's obvious Chevalier puts effort into creating a realistic era. Needed a lot of work on plot, dialogue and action/events.I'd skip this one."
4,Interesting Story,"I find anything about London interesting, especially history so I enjoyed this book. A bit of a Dickensian feel to it. I did not see any similarity to the ""bogus"" patriotism after 9-11 in the scenes of signature collecting and the patriotic rally. I don't remember anyone coming around collecting signatures after 9-11. I do remember all the flags on cars which didn't bother me a bit. Not sure where the previous reviewer was going with that. There's a world of difference in the conditions we live under than in London in the time of the French revolution."
2,"""Intermediate to Advanced""? Yeah right.","While this book was decent, it failed to challenge or intrest me. It spent much time on notes and rythmns that any ""intermediate to advanced"" player ought to already know. I would not recommend this book for any true ""intermediate to advanced player"""
5,Bullies are a Pain in the Brain,Great DVD to educate young children on ways not to bully their peers. I would highly recommend this DVD.
4,Helpful to kids,This video is a great ice-breaker for kids and adults. The show provides excellent methods for showing kids how to deal with bullies. The one thing we must remember is that bullies can be anywhere not just at school. While this story is set at school the points that are made can apply to bullies universally.
5,A must watch for all kids,"This is a well made video for kids of all ages. Even younger children will have no trouble comprehending the concepts it tries to teach. My children are 4 and 7 and they had no trouble fully understanding it. The video held their interest and helped open up a dialogue regarding bullying.The video explains the tactics that bullies use to intimidate their victims. The main character demonstrates what children often do when bullied, some common misconceptions and what tactics are most successful.I found the video to be very informative, even for myself, and would recommend it to all parents of young children."
4,Age appropriate....,Outlines in a step-by-step 'cool' process. The best part of this DVD presentation on how to bully-proof yourself is the 'twist' ending.
5,Love it,I have had my superdisk quite awhile. It works great! I have yet to figure out how to get my cd burner to work - so I keep using my superdisk.
5,Great Tunes Great Sound,"The music is great, no doubt about it. What jumped out at me was the sound quality. The remastering is fantastic."
4,a very well done comedy,"its placed in mexico city, a young couple with a dougher start to have some problems and they decide to separate for a time, but love is always around."
4,Inspirational and authentic adventure autobiography,"I laughed out loud while following the adventures of this courageous and talented risk taker, who braved Mexico with only his trusty canine companion. I am so pleased he survived all the risks and challenges of traveling and living in Mexico City to share his experiences, the characters he met, the excitement of his fascinating radio career, the courtship of his wife and all of the other twists and turns of his autobiography. I can't wait to see it made into a movie!"
4,An Interesting and Useful Book,"This is a humorous and very interesting tale about life in Mexico, by a man who did not let being blind slow him down. A good read, made easier by its large print and spacing. I recommend it!Mary Slattery Shaddox"
1,a narrow view,"This book contains little perspective on Wellstone himself, a figure whom it is easy to love or hate.It's mainly useful for recording certain facts surrounding the 1990 election and for a largely positive spin -- in a superficial and biased view -- of Paul Wellstone."
1,Only a puff Piece,"Again, the ""politically correct"" academic culture strikes! How could it overlook one of its own? It ignores Wellstone's total one-sidedness. The problem is that a University Press released what would have been fine as an unabashed campaign document sponsored by the subject's political party."
5,Great on the Go!,"This is one of my favorite eye shadows because it is easy to use, lasts a long time and looks great on! Whether you have a lot of time to get yourself ready or only a minute or 2, this ""rollerball"" method has you covered. I wear Bambari and have gotten many compliments because of its neutral slightly glittery effect - which i think makes me look awake :)"
3,it works okay,"I really bought this product so I would have the ability to grate nutmegs, so at the same time I also ordered whole nutmeg and this is where I was dissatisfied. I don't know what was sent but it was not nutmeg."
3,unnecessary plastic parts.,I don't like the little plastic ring at the bottom. Why do they have force plastic parts in equipment that doesn't need it? I'll buy an all metal one eventually.
3,"makes a fantastic, fine texture",Only complaint is that you can't take it apart so it is hard to get out all the nutmeg gratings or clean it.
2,not thrilled,"i bought this thinking it would be easier to grate my nutmeg or other hard spices. the holes are not big enough to let the spice come through, but when it does decide to come through then it is stuck to the bottom of the blade and i have to stick something up in there to get it out. and no, it wasn't wet either."
1,Kaffir Lime,Not what I've looking for.I've returned the lemon lime tree?? back.They have send to me the wrong tree!!not the Kaffir Lime tree .I got the refund anyway.
1,"Hard Drives are Bad, Do not order","After having this laptop for 60 days, it completely self-destructed. A tech went through HP to fix it, and they said the hard-drive was bad and would ship us a new one in 2 days. A week went by, no hard-drive.We called HP back asking for the missing hard-drive, they said it was because that hard-drive is on back-order indefinitely. We asked if that was because everyone was having a problem and they were having to ship them out faster than they could make them, and they admitted ""Yes, there is a problem with this hard-drive model, so we don't have enough""And of course, Amazon is unwilling to let us exchange for a new laptop because we are past the ""30 day maximum"" with them. So we are just out a computer.Bad service, bad product. Do not buy!"
3,Very cute,"Great quality, colors & pictures. Games are OK, the best one being the card game just like go fish."
3,Good read,"I liked the general storyline and it had a little different spin on this generia, but it was, maybe, a little long"
3,Not a re-read,"I tend to base my reviews on whether I feel, after reading, that I'll want to read a book over again some day - in other words, that it's a keeper. And even though this book is well-written for the most part and I can't find any fault in the characterizations or the plot (though the heroine was just SO sweet & good, and I did feel the plot dragged on a bit), it's just not good enough to rate ""keeper"" status.I think the 3 star rating is a fair one, considering that the book just didn't take off for me, but that's not to say it might not do that for you. Everyone has their own criteria for ""keepers"" or ""re-reads"" or whatever you want to call them...but this wasn't one for me. A pleasantly-written read, but not a great one."
3,It's okay,Light reading with interesting back ground history. Descriptions of country of north Queensland added to the story. Early angst between three societies of people well recorded.
2,The sinks were not the same!,"I ordered 2 of the same sinks at the same time for a dual vanity. The first one arrived 3 days before the second one and when the second one arrived it was a totally different sink. It was round and polished but the Decolav stamp was on 2 different sids, the overflow on one was 3 large holes and on the other it was 4 small holes. Also they were not the same size. Bottom line, the sinks had they been the same would have been beautiful but there product quality is not always the same."
4,Excellent Buy,"If you are looking for a cheap and organized view of one of the prolific revolutionary authors, nothing better than this."
3,Nice unit with some annoying missing features,"This recorder has three CD drawers and one minidisc, with a nice one-touch record to CD feature. Recording from CD to MD on the XU-301 gives a disc that sounds almost indistinguishable from the original. Optical outputs make it possible to dub from one MD to another if you have a portable. The remote has a flip-out keypad with all the alphanumerics for titling. Random play can mix CD and MD tracks. The bad news: the remote does not have a pause button. That's right folks - how could they miss it? Especially since the main unit has a single play/pause button. Also, the titling is restricted to 32 characters.Good value for a moderately priced unit, but they should re-work the remote."
2,Two Stars,"I purchased FANTASY because it appeared on so many List Manias. Sadly, I must say I wish I hadn't been so gullible. Except for one of the four stories, I found myself reading it simply because I spent money on it."
3,An ok read,"I was honestly looking forward to this book, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations. I loved The Widow's Auction by Sabrina Jefferies, and Mr. Speedy was cute if a little stretched. But Luisa's Desire and The Awakening, by Christine Feehan basically set my teeth on edge. Luisa's Desire about a vampire in the 1600's was so far from believability it was ludicrous. And the Awakening was VERRRY Preachy. We all know the rain forest is in danger, but we don't need to be hit over the head with it."
4,Fantasy (Leopard),"I really liked all three of the stories. I wish they were a little more to them though. I was really getting into them, and they ended."
1,cheap and misrepresented,"the name arbor scientific makes it sound quality, but the box you get has no such name and is some cheap brand you would expect to find at wal-mart. this lamp lasted almost as long as something you buy at wal-mart too. about 30 minutes use and it already died. i think it was the flimsy power cord. i also noticed a metallic smell on the glass when it was on?"
4,Exactly what my Son Wanted,"This product had good reviews, so I took a chance. It was exactly what I was looking for. Large enough to be showy, works well and is a cool adition to his room. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is becasue I think ALL plasma balls are a little over priced."
3,The Imation Superdisk drive is ok if you're patient,"When I got the super disk external drive, I was expecting it to be similar to the zip disk drive located in my PC. Well, the superdisk does hold lots of info, but it's slow, and incredibly noisy. If you leave the disk inside the drive and you're not using it, it will still make tons of noise every time you open an application and makes opening the application slower. However, if you don't mind noise that could wake a family member or a little slowness, it might be great for you."
4,"Fine, Under-rated Songbird","Helen Grayco was seemingly content to be Mrs. Spike Jones, as she recorded only sporadically in the 1950s, when her fine voice was at its peak. This LP was recorded during her Label ""X""-Vik period, during which she also recorded some smokin' R&B covers (her ""Night Train"" is killer); it would have been nice to see these included as bonus tracks, but here we get just the 12-track album at a reasonable price. That's fine, as Helen does justice to some top-shelf standards, singing with the musical taste and feeling for the lyric that was once required of any successful pop singer. Songbook lovers and seekers of obscure but excellent 50s songbirds should enjoy this album. Of course, it took the Japanese to get it into print... American Sony/BMG, you are such losers."
3,"Pretty good, but not as good as the other reviewers claimed","I special ordered this book, because I saw all the good reviews on it. I have to admit that it's a lot better than the other werewolf book I read. There was quite a bit of surprises in the story that I didn't expect. A lot of good character development, especially with the main character and his ""pack"". I recommend it, but definitely not a 5."
1,Questionable Customer Review,"The first review of this book is by one of the authors and not a customer. It seems a little self-serving if you ask me and should not be listed as a ""customer"" review."
3,Can't rate the toy since we can't PLAY with the toy!,"I bought this as a x-mas present for my son.. I was under the assumption from the description given that the battery was included. The description says ""Batteries: 1 9 volt battery required. (included)"". WRONG!!! It requires a 6v NiCd and charger in addition to the 9v that is NOT included. Needless to say, we have yet to play with this toy and its 4 days after x-mas. Its not the toy that deserves the 3 star rating, its Amazon and actually they deserve less for the false advertising!"
3,Misleading information,Order this toy for my 5 year old son.....The truck is great but the description only indicated that a 9 volt battery was needed and it was included.The battery was not included. The truck also needs a 9.6 V Rechargeable Turbo Battery Pack and Charger which was not stated in the description and will not work.Talk about a lousy Christmas for my boy....Someone needs to make sure if a car or truck needs special batteries that this information is in the description.As I stated before...the information stated that a 9 volt battery was included and no batteries are part of this package.I wish there was someplace else I can complain about mis-advertising!!!
1,"Great Songs, Terrible Videos",I love Ice-T and I think O.G. is one of the best rap albums ever. But this video is awful. Every video but one is just Ice-T and his posse posing and look tough for the camera. Pretty boring stuff. The only decent video is of Lifestyles of the Rich and Infamous where Ice-T shows his humor and ability to entertain. Otherwise this a very unfortunate and forgettable collection of videos - if one can even call them that.
1,OUTRAGEOUSLY BAD DEAL!,"I was VERY disappointed in both the quality and price of this product. The quality was poor, as the candy was stale, and the price was totally ridiculous...over $16.00 for a few pieces of toffee. I'll never buy this item from this seller again. Hopefully the Mackintosh's toffee bars will become available again sometime soon, because I've never had a bad one of those!"
2,Not like it used to be,"When growing up Mac was my favorite toffee, but it has changed a lot over the years. Now it is more like those very soft and dry-ish square caramels you can get at any grocery store. True, it doesn't stick to your teeth anymore, but it doesn't have that buttery melt anymore either.If you're looking for a good chewy and firm toffee like Mac used to be, try Walkers' Nonsuch Original Toffee. I tried that recently and was impressed. (As of this review, you can get it here on Amazon as well.)"
1,Boring...,"I wanted to like this book, because I've been looking for books for girls my age that have a good, Christian message... but this book was excruciatingly boring.It was very slow up until a certain part, but by the time you get to the exciting stuff, you're attention is completely lost. It seems to drag on a little bit... because the writer keeps mentioning the vague ""secret"" until it is revealed at the end of the book. You're expecting the secret to be very exciting because of all the little mentionings of the ""secret"", but it just doesn't add up.Another thing that I've noticed about these books is that in every book, SOMEONE has to die! I understand that they are trying to make the books realistic because back in those times many people died of hardship and disease, but they play it up so much that it's kind of depressing.If you want a good series to read, try the ""Anne of Green gables"" series by LM Montgomery. They are wonderful!"
3,Not all I'd hoped for,It does work very well.Except it's top heavy when using the no hands feature.Just not strong enough to hold it.
2,Can I can in this pressure cooker?,I was disappointed when I got this cooker. I wanted a pressure cooker/canner. Has anyone canned in this cooker?I'm considering returning it.
5,Use with caution,"There are some great things about this pot:It's made from stainless steel which is easy tokeep clean and which has none of the corrosionproblems that plague aluminum.The price is right. You can pay a lot for a fancySwiss model-four times as much in fact and in thiscase, you don't get what you pay for.It will add a dimension to your cooking. Dishesthat used to take all day can be cooked in an houror two and homemade stocks and soups will returnto your table.All of the safety problems that used to come withpressure cookers have been solved and there's no reasonto deny you and your family all that good food.Bear in mind that this larger size cooker needsan appropriately sized burner and that any browningneeds to be done cautiously.Lynn Hoffman, author of New Short Course in Wine,The andbang BANG: A Novel bang-BANG from Kunati press.(ISBN 1601640005)"
4,"Great game, solid construction...even looks great.","Seven year old loves this game - and so do I. It's a fun little game that's basically a manual pinball game...to play a baseball game. Sure, the scoring and such is manual, but that's part of the fun. And you can still strike out (like I did...)The materials are solid and the game is pretty fun - if you hit the ball and don't get a hit or out, you keep trying to hit it until you do. Get enough hits (or a homerun) and start keeping score! I haven't had any problems with pieces breaking and it feels quite sturdy, so I'm not very worried about it.I have, however, made one minor adjustment to this. Its placement. While it was a gift for a child, it looks better in person than in the pictures, so I've made a home for it on a coffee table rather than stashed in a bedroom.Would recommend! It provides some good quick and easy fun!"
1,Junk,doesn't stand up. found it cheaper many times over. Just sets on shelf. Can use as decore but not really useful.
2,"Great idea, no durability","We have received two of these baseball games. The look is great and it seemed like a great idea. The first one arrived broken with the home run ramp ripped off the game. We exchanged it for a second one that lasted a couple of hours, the spring rod the shoots the ball broke and the flapper rod broke. My son that was really excited about it is now just going to take the refund and get something else. It would have been great if it had worked more than a few hours. We have three boys, if it can't make it a few hours its just not going to last ever."
1,Lasted One Day,My ten year old grandson loved this Circa Baseball Game. He got to play it for exactly one day. The day after Christmas that infamous tiny screw came out of the plunger assembly and it all fell apart.
2,Poor design and or quality control - bat spring installed in wrong direction.,"The problem with the game is laughable actually. The tension spring for the bat is installed in the wrong direction. The bat actually snaps backwards - so if you want to hit the ""ball"" - you have to fight the spring and have excellent timing.I gave thought to actually trying to take apart the game and install it correctly - but the construction is so pathetic and such cheap parts are used - that I nixed the idea and decided to return it."
4,great classic toy,I got this for my twelve year old son to give him something to do besides playing on the computer or playing video games. He loved it and i liked how it was made of wood. it reminds me of old time toys.
5,Awesome action!,My nephew loves baseball so I thought this would be a good addition to his collection. It turns out to be his most favorite to play! I am glad I bought it for him.
5,Love this game for all ages,"when my boys were 5 and 7 years old they got this game and they still play with it occasionally at 15 and 17. their younger cousins came over to play with it and loved it so I bought it for my 5 year old nephew. Very durable and fun toy, the only downside is we have lost some of the balls to it over the years."
5,Great value (based on cheap Amazon Price),"This was really inexpensive on Amazon - thus I thought it would be really cheaply made. However, I was surprised that it was actually all quiet durable and well made of wood. The kids and I have had some fun games with it."
5,great gift for grandpa,"I bought this game for my dad, his 90 years old and doesn't get around much anymore. He has always had a love for baseball so I thought this would be perfect for him. The game has worked out perfectly he has it sitting on his tv tray and plays it often."
2,"Yep, it broke","It was great fun until it broke. The set screw on the plunger that holds a piece in place for the spring to push against came loose on the first day. It's essentially impossible to tighten, and even if you were able to successfully tighten it, it looks like it would come loose again right away since the indentation the set screw goes into on the plunger rod is so incredibly shallow. My son wanted to give up on the game when this happened, but I came up with a workaround of just rolling the ball down the ramp in center field (the ""home run"" ramp). He still plays with it some but nothing like he did those first couple of hours before it broke. The mechanism for the bat still works, though, so that's what keeps it from getting only one star for durability. If you don't mind doing the workaround, the game is still fun, but having to roll the ball down the ramp is a hassle because you have so much less time befor the ball gets to the bat."
4,Nice classic baseball game!,"I bought this game for Christmas for my boyfriend and his son, both who are baseball fanatics. They both enjoy playing this game. Not only is this game fun to play, but it's nice-looking enough to keep out on display in the family/recreation room. It's a lot sturdier than I expected it to be; it's well-made and doesn't look ""cheapy""."
2,Good concept bad implementation,"This is a classic pinball game scaled to fit a coffee table. The durability, however, is below any thinkable standard. The tightening nut on the main lever broke after half of the game. Tightening didn't help for long, and my husband had to adjust the screw and actually weld it to the main part to make it hold. Our kids were more upset than happy with this toy: they are NOT the kind of kids who break toys and they are not used to seeing a toy break just from normal use. Will never buy from the same manufacturer, although we all love pinball games and will certainly try other companies."
3,Not very durable,"My six year old son really likes this game, but it broke after two days. I think it is recommended for ages 8 and up so he's a little young but I was disappointed in how quickly it broke. My husband was able to fix it so we'll see how long it lasts."
3,No instructions,12/19 The game arrived without instructions. I called Amazon and they in turn called the vendor. I'm still waiting for the the promised instructions. This is a Christmas gift for my grandsons and I'm hopeful I can give it to them intact. It looks as though it will be a fun game perhaps a little tame for the electronic generation but nostalgic for me.
1,Junk,"This was a gift for my grandson. The product had quality problems from the first assembly. Parts didn't fit and ball shute has a glitch that prevented the ball from entering the playing field with any velocity. My daughter said she would keep it as a decorative piece for his sports decorated room, but it's nearly useless for play."
1,Baseball Circa,My son received this game for Christmas. It had a broken bat which prevented the bat from hitting the metal ball with any strength. The game was rendered unplayable. I opened the bottom and found a small broken screw which was supposed to secure the bat to the lever and the spring. I don't think there was any quality control to test each game before it rolled out of the factory. I returned it to Amazon for a full refund including shipping.The return experience with Amazon was excellent since they emailed me return shipping labels without hesitation.
4,"Smaller than I thought, but fun","This toy seems to be the ""economical version"" of theOld Century Baseball Tabletop Gamesmade by the same company. Instead of 3 ramps, this game only has 1. It is also much smaller. Overall, my 8 year old and 11 year old really like it and play with it from time to time. It doesn't hold their attention as long as a nintendo DS (what does?), but they'll bang around on it for a good 15-20 minutes a few times a week. I like it because the price was right and it's not plastic. It really is wood. It sounds funny, but it just feels good to play this game. Additionally, the unit is built very well and is proably more durable than one might expect. They didn't scrimp on manufacturing this unit and I would expect their other games are the same."
1,"Fun, but it BROKE VERY QUICKLY; unplayable now","My 10-year-old son loved this game while it lasted. Overall, I would have rated it 5 stars except it lasted about three months. After that, the skimpy assembly that holds the plunger together (the metal rod that launches the ball into the game) fell apart and a tiny metal screw was lost. I contacted University Games to inquire about replacement parts. Their super-friendly and helpful customer service department told me they don't have parts, and promised instead to replace the game. However, three months later we have never received a replacement game, repairs parts, or any other resolution.Given this experience, I cannot say I would recommend this product to anyone else, nor would I really be inclined to buy another product from University Games.Don't say I didn't warn ya .......UPDATE: In all fairness, University Games did finally replace this game with a new one, free of charge. No problems with the new one .... yet."
4,Really Great Product,"What a fun product! I got this DVD for my grandkids. We love how easy it is to use -- we can quickly flip back forth among the languages offered. The pace was good. I especially liked that many of the same images were used in each language. For example, the word ""grapes"" was used several times and now we know that word in several languages -- even Turkish! The video clips were clever and entertaining. They captured our attention and made is really fun to watch the whole alphabet. I can't wait to see the rest of the products in the series!"
1,Don't buy it for French,I am a native from France...so i bought the DVD so my daughter could hear the alphabet in French. The speaker is not even a native. She has accent. And they misspelled a word!! incredible!I would not recommend it.
5,Mommy Songs: everyone can enjoy!,My sixteen month old daughter had no interest in videos or television. When I introduced her to Mommy Songs I was amazed that it stopped her in her tracks. She watched Beth Klarreich Corwin intently. When she heard a song she knew she started to dance! My six and four year old boys loved singing along to some of their old favorites as well. I think this video is so appealing because of Ms. Corwin's natural approach to singing and storytelling. This is a video that invites movement and participation which can be enjoyed on many levels.
4,"Great story, oddly structured...","Here's the thing.. I enjoy hard historical military literature. I enjoy picking the brains of great generals and statesmen, etc. But this book drags on at first. I think it is the structure of the book. The author is very capable of telling a great story and the material is well researched and interesting. The problem lies in the fact that the first section of the book goes into great detail involving the hierarchy of the Werwolf movement which, even by nazi standards, was a jumbled bureaucratic mess.Solution? Easy. Jump around. Read about the Werwolf exploits, then their mottled command structure.Final word is, if you are interested in or ever wanted to discover more about the Nazi guerilla movement I highly recommend this book. There are plenty of great, well documented stories of the insurgents and their methods. They just surface a bit later in the book."
4,nice nazis research book,this is a very good book if one want to find out more about what happen to the nazi party or what is left of it.in this book it tells you that they didnt just drop their guns and go home but keep on fighting .well doing sabotajing and terrorizing the allies who is occupying germany.if one want to find out how and what they to without really any big support . and in small cell.it is like they are terrorist in germany after the war until they die out in 1947.great if you ask me but one have to really read it to find out why i find it great.
4,Nice compact ball head,"This little item seems well made, and a quick test showed it capable of supporting my Nikon D40 with the 70-300 Nikkor lens, on a monopod or on the Gorillapod SLR-ZOOM model. It'd have earned 4.5 stars if that were an option. The main feature I'd like would be a turntable for panning, immediately below the camera attachment (so that the pan is level) The turntable at the tripod attachment offered by this head cannot produce a level pan unless the tripod itself is level."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I currently have a Sunpak Compact Ball head on my monopod and I have always loved it. Rock solid.I purchased another carbon fiber monopod for travel and needed a ball head so I ordered this one.It seems to be rigid and sturdy but there are two flaws that caused me to order another Sunpak for my needs.( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009UT0Q/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details )First, the Slik uses a cork gasket where it secures to the camera. It slips and does not stay in place as well as the RUBBER gasket on my Sunpak.Second, At the portrait setting, it does not default to a 90 degree setting. You must carefully align the camera and then tighten it.The Sunpak defaults to a true 90 degrees. Just loosen the lever, flip the camera to portrait orientation and tighten it back. Easy and fast.I will keep this for use on a flash gun but for monopod use, it is useless."
3,START HERE!!!!,"Ok, you're not going to be a javascript wizard by reading this book. You may not even close the back cover with a complete understanding of the document object model, or what makes text scroll, or even why javascript works. You may even be a little teed that you were made to type all of that stuff (most of which worked, some of which didn't) and sort of ""left hanging."" Where now?What you will have when completing this book is enough knowledge to go forward to more advanced material and find out why javascript can give you hives of pleasure when implemented correctly. If you have no programming background, you're going to have to grind through this material eventually to make javascript do what you want it to. Think of this book as a first step towards a long journey of enlightenment. Wrox's ""Beginning Javascript"" is a good follow-up."
1,Worthless,"This book omits the most important reason to buy a book like this - the goodies! They're all on a web site. If you want to look at actual javascripts from this book, they're free on the web anyway. Buying this book is a complete waste of money."
1,JavaScript Goodies,This is a Terrible book! I have never seen a more obnoxious book. It is full of code that doesn't work. Even copying and pasting from his web site doesn't work. I have used this book and 2 classrooms of 20 students each and they absolutely hated the book and hated his bigger and mighty attitude!...
1,Far too basic and misleading description,"If Javascript in 24 Hours is giving you a headache, if you need 18 pages to tell you what a variable is, this is the book for you. Most of the things the blurb says the book teaches you are lies. It teaches you EXTREME basics in excrutiating detial and then lists the scripts on Joes page. Telling me I can download a script is not teaching me, although as I said, he doesn't teach anything that an average intellect couldn't figure out by downloading scripts & looking at them. I bought it particularly because it claims it would teach me how to ""create a visitor counter"" so I expected to learn cookies. Needless to say, it does not. A total waste of money, I will never look at it again. I recommend SAMS Teach yourself Javascript in 24 hours for the total novice, and I'm yet to find a book that teaches JavaScript quickly and logically to experienced programmers."
2,"Style good for beginners, but too many errors will confuse","The style, presentation, good for beginners features are potentially great, but there are too many errors that will confuse and mislead beginners and frustrate experienced programmers (I've been programming for 44 years). I now have very little confidence in what I read in the book because of the errors and misleading discussions. His explanation of capitalization, spacing, and line breaking on page 8 shows he doesn't know JavaScript syntax. He makes it sound like black magic. There are proper ways to do those things. His discussion on random numbers and modulus arithmetic in Chapter 6 is fatally flawed. His explanations of some other computer science terms and concepts is confused, incomplete, and erroneous."
1,Avoid at all cost,"This book is completely useless for learning how to code with Javascript. It's littered with typos, which is rather a problem when trying to learn such a precise language. It seemed helpful at first, but then I got so frustrated tripping over the errors in the text that I just gave up. Look elsewhere for help getting started with Javascript, I will!"
5,This is a fantastic book.,"I've been coding in HTML for almost 4 years and just recently needed to learn JavaScript for a project at work and this book is fantastic. All the material is presented in an intuitive and friendly manner and it doesn't feel as if the information is being ""dumbed-down"". His method of teaching is better then most instructors that I ever had in school. The fact that the book is only $19.99 is also great considering most books with half the content are $39.99 and up. Thanks Dr. Joe. (I am in no way related to Joe Burns, Ph.D., it's merely coincidence that our last names are the same"
2,"No ""good"" in ""goodies""","As a computer science major already familiar with some object oriented programming, I did not find this book helpful. Like many other computer books, it walks the user through lessons or projects. I would much rather prefer a book like ""JavaScript:Your visual blueprint for building dymanic Web pages"" by Kelly L. Murdock that covers topics by examples and screen shots."
1,Don't get it!,"Alright, This book does teach you the basics of JavaScript, But I assure you if you copy the code from this book you will get errors. I am on page 21 and I have already found 16 syntax errors or code that doesnt match what was displayed on the document. I have had previous programming experience and this book shows that the writer has had little experience with programming. Yea, sure he has his own website about HTML and JavaScript, but that doesnt make him a good writer. Sure get the book if you want to look at errors all the time."
5,Everything and more,"This book contains everything on the HTMLGoodies site and more. I thought I could get away with knowing just what was on the Goodies site, but after I bought this book I was able to do absolutely everything with Javascript. I learned arrays, forms, etc. Joe Burns writes everything in such a simple, easy to understand way that only an idiot wouldn't understand. I highly recommend buying this book if you want to learn Javascript like a pro."
2,OK Toy - Lousy Instructions,"Once you get this thing figured out it's not a bad toy, but don't expect your child to be able to figure it out. I'm a grown woman with a graduate degree and it took me five tries to get this right - by that time we'd used up so much of the materials that I'm now trying to find out how to order more and of course they don't give you a clue about that either..... IF you buy this toy, I'll clue you in about two things. Make sure the sticky tape is rolling the OPPOSITE direction from they way they tell you to roll it - the way they tell you to do it does NOT work, and also it doesn't work unless you cut a 1/4"" border around the outside of the sticker when you're finshed. If you cut right to the edge, there's nothing sticking the picture to the sticky back paper and it all falls apart. Good luck! Make sure to open this toy on a stress-free day... :)"
1,EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING TOY!,"I have never been so frustrated with a toy! The instructions are not only hard to read but wrong! You get better instructions if you go to the Alex toys website, so just throw the instructions away that come with the toy. You waste alot of material with this toy, it seems to be designed that way, so you better purchase extra sticker material when you buy the toy. It jams extremely easily so a child should not play with this awful toy alone."
3,"Not ""that"" bad.","What would be better than a toy that lets you turn any piece of paper into what every 3 year old LOVES? My 2 year old saw this in some toy magazine sent to us and although she can't read yet, she pointed immediately to it and all she could say for the 4 months leading up to christmas was ""Sticker Machine"". When I read the reviews here I was a little worried but I got it anyway. It is NOT that hard to set up and get working. It would be tough if the kid is dancing around you asking you to get it working. The idea is the back role is sticker paper, the front roll is clear tap. Any paper you put between them is slapped together to form a sticker on the paper coming out the end, allowing you to cut around it and have a sticker of it. The cutting device is not so hot though, it doesn't cut and creates a jam in the paper feed outlet... Overall it isn't as horrible as people are saying."
1,"""Sucker Maker"" is what they should call this toy","This toys instructions make no sense. in my first attempt to put this thing together, I managed to jam paper in the out-put slot and there is no way to get it out without taking the toy apart. The tape is cheap and rips in the middle (as cheap tape will), and the feeder knob doesn't have enough traction to move the paper though. The only thing this toy has done for us is make a sucker out of me for buying it."
1,"Great Idea, Lousy Toy","I agree completely with the other reviewers here who have complained about the lousy design of this toy. It is not easy to use and does not work properly 50-75% of the time (paper jams, stickers won't feed through on 1st-2nd-3rd attempts, etc.). It is incredibly frustrating for parents and kids alike. You waste a ton of the ""sticker paper"" through the machine just to produce one (non-sticky) sticker. Plan to go through a whole roll just to make a handful of stickers, then shell out another $5.99 for one replacement roll. When my children finally do manage to get it to work .... the sticker stays put for about 60 seconds before peeling off their shirt. I give this toy a F."
1,Waste of money and time...,"It is easier on your pocket book and sanity to just go purchase [...] of stickers that your child will love. This toy infuriated me to no end and made my son cry because it kept jamming no matter how perfectly I tried to do it. Plus, as other reviewers pointed out, so much of the product is wasted for each sticker it is useless. Save yourself the heartache and do not buy this. I am sending ours out into the world on freecycle so I never have to look at it again!"
1,horrible!!!!,"I am a 40 year old women with a Ph.D. This toy stumped me, my eleven year old and my eight year old and made my five year old burst into tears. I'd rather clean the house for three hours than try to figure out this annoying toy. BEWARE."
1,Do not buy this!,"This toy is a waste of money, It looks so much fun and promising though. First of all the instructions are not helpful.Then where can I start? First there is no refill and we had to use all the rolls just to understand how it works. There is a huge, HUGE waste of paper.The paper jams in the machine and doesn't come out the right way, when it does the scissors wrinkle the paper making it jam even more.When you place the little drawings on the paper and roll it, it doesn't place it right, you have to push it with a piece of paper.It's a wonder if they even try out this toy before marketing it!"
2,"Fun, as long as it doesn't jam","My daughter loved this, but it did take a few tries to get it started. If it jams, then you have to take the whole thing apart. The cutting mechanism would only work left to right. The directions were just okay, but no mention of how to get more paper. This is a clear marketing error. =)As much as this is a good concept. I don't recommend it."
2,"5 year old loves it, but poor quality","My five year old could not wait to use this as she just got it as a gift for a birthday. She is very determined to keep using it and it does work; however, much waste is involved between stickers. I have started drawing on the top of the blank laminate with permanent markers (she can't really draw with these yet). We have had several malfunctions, creased stickers and turned over stickers. The instructions were very clear. On a positive note, it has held her attention, she loves cranking it and using the slicer when the stickers crank out."
2,Accel Ignition Control Module,"Accel is an excellent brand for cars 1/4 of a mile, but personally regarding this ignition control module I am not satisfied, its lifetime is very short when used continuously, thanks amazon for good deals."
4,Oldtimers score big,"Although there is a tad too much about Brewitt's realtionship to some of these NHL oldtimers, I just loved the tales told. Rene Robert calling Scotty Bowman a ""platehead"" and Robert tossing a hat-trick puck at the Mtl bench was a classic howler. As was Butch Goring and the hot dog incident which is as funny as that wreck of a helmet he used to wear. There are so many but it was nice to see stories on Bill White and Fats Delvecchio--two of the more underrated stars of the past."
2,Nice feel and style but doesn't serve its purpose,"It looks and feels nice. You won't have any problems navigating around any screen with this. But when it comes down to playing simulation games this pad is useless.This is my first wireless game pad and will be my last. Playing a soccer game for example, every touch is vital. But with this, it cannot receive every push. Even when you have the gamepad right next to the wireless adaptor it won't be able to receive every signal.It's not too bad, but it has denied me a few classic goals which can be very fustrating. As a recommendation, don't buy a wireless gamepad for a few years until they are flawless. It will let you down."
3,Serious range problems - But over all good feel,This Controller is better than many on the market today. Pretty much only rivaled by Logitech. The FPS mode and programable feature are pretty cool and the controller has a decent over all feel. The buttons and digital pad are slighty chintzy but the analogs have a nice feel to them.SERIOUS RANGE PROBLEM.It's a real plus having the extra two thumb buttons but I think there is a corded version. Get that instead. I have the USB trasmitter plugged into the back of my system which is on the floor 2 feet from me. I have to hold the controller under the table to get a solid connection.I wish that Logitech would come out with another one that has more buttons and is more programable. This controller is priced about right.
4,Great Option,I really like it.. it has a great response time.. and is really easy to configure..Two thing i wish they were better.1. Sticks are not quite sensitive.2. Is does not have vibration.. thought you should know it from its technical details. :P
1,Not true to book,I was disappointed with the way this movie version of Roald Dahl's amazing book strayed from the original story line. I also really didn't care for the animation. The one plus of having such differences between the book and movie were that the 5th grade students that I showed this to after having read the book were able to do a great Venn diagram full of contrasts.
3,BFG Review,"It's an okay movie. The book is WAY better of course, just like most movies that come from books."
4,Friendly Review,"I bought this video because I had just finished reading the novel to my class. I always think it is a valuable activity for students to respond to both literature and media. It makes for a great compare and contrast activity. I thought the video was cute, and the kids loved it. I'll definitely use it in the future."
5,best book ever,so many adventures and weird thibgs happen in this enjoyable story. its my favorite book of all time
1,The only thing clear...,"...was the collection capsule. I was expecting less suction than a bulb, but was still disappointed. Not really worth a premium."
3,helps on really bad days...,"But isn't powerful enough to do much for a slightly runny nose. Also, she hates it as much as the bulb, but it's a bit faster, so it's more useful overall. She likes the music, but not when I'm using it."
1,too weak,"I couldn't wait to get it. I got so excited when it finally arrived! so I used it right away! sooo disapointed! it did not get anything out at all, it is soooo weak! The one from the hopital is great but broke from using it so much and then we got one from Target and it works! but this nasal-clear is no good. do not buy it."
5,How did we every live without this?,"Highly recommended. No, the baby doesn't like it. But it sure beats the manual version! And it works GREAT. This is not for dried boogers. But, you CAN irrigate with saline first, then suck out the results. This is indispensible for when your baby has a head cold and is producing copious amounts of snot.If you lose one of the silicone tips, they can be ordered from the manufacturer at 1-888-232-6476 for $6.99 for a pack of 4 (2 little and 2 big tips)."
4,great product!,I wish I had found this product earlier. Works great. Could improve slimmer design for better grip and reduce motor sound. Worths every penny!
3,"interesting product, but not for my girl","I have read so many good reviews about this product before I decided to give it a try. It is painful to see my daughter have really hard time to breathe 'cause of the stuffed nose. The music which is supposed to distract babies actually not so useful and the suction is not as strong as the bulb. After tried several times, I gave up and keep using the bulb aspirator instead."
2,It doesn't work,"My baby is 6 months old and had a very stuffy nose. I purchased this nasal aspirator based on the reviews, but it didn't work for us. The suction is very mild. It doesn't take anything out. While the music is a nice bonus and my baby seems to be distracted by it, once it is in her nose she doesn't care about the music. The bottom line is this aspirator doesn't really work. It's not any better then the manual one. Personally the manual one works much better for us. She cries a lot, but at least I can clear her nose."
2,Not blowing me away..,"I will try anything to get my baby snot-free, this makes my baby happy but does not extract enough from the nose. Nosefrida works better, I control the suction myself and it's really quick. I don't think any baby likes having anything near their nose, but when you are desperate, you do what you have to do!"
4,very convenient,"is very easy to use and very covenient, just wash it and it's ready to use again! I showed it to my baby's paediatrician and he loved it, he even wrote down the name to recommend it to his patient's."
2,nasal not-clear,"Nice packaging and music but found the old fashioned bulb syringe works much more effectively. Overall, I would not recommend spending the money on this product."
2,Not a good product,Not enough suction to remove the nasal stuffies. My daughter hated it. She was scared of it and the noise. The only thing that got her attention but wasn't so impressive was the music.
1,Don't waste your time or money. It dosen't work!,"My 10 month old absolutely hates it when I even come near his nose, so I was thrilled to see this product thinking it had to be better than the hospital aspirator. Not even close. I tried it twice & both times went back to the aspirator. It didn't get ANYTHING out. Don't waste your money on it. I would have left it with zero stars if I didn't have to enter a rating (Amazon doesn't allow 0 stars.)"
5,It works,This item is great. So far he lets us use it with a smile. He got really upset with the old bulb thing.Worth every penny!!
2,Not worth the money,"While it's true that this doesn't make our four-month-old son scream like the bulb does, I believe that's because it doesn't work. We have yet to get anything out, even when he's obviously congested. It's a great idea and we were hopeful about it, but it just hasn't been worth the money we spent."
4,It works but she still hates it.,It works pretty well if you can keep their head still. If they won't hold still it's kind of useless.
4,Better than the bulb,"With fresh batteries and good technique, this aspirator works better than the old fashioned bulb we were using before. Works particularly well on loose runny mucus. Not so well on thicker or dried up boogers. Baby still hates it but we find that it works faster and more effectively so there is a significant decrease in the the time that she fights us. Also hard to clean but really no harder than the bulb."
2,For the diehards only,"This album is a huge disappointment. And to think I paid 20 bucks for this 7 years ago. Done on the cheap with synthesised keyboards, this has absolutley none of the character, energy and charm OR real instruments of Tiny's first two albums. His ressurection of 'Tiptoe' was a waste of recording tape. Listen to the original to hear how it should sound. This CD was relegated to the box in my spare room and never ventures out. If you want to find out about Tiny Tim, start with 'God bless Tiny Tim' and give this one a miss. For the diehards only."
3,With me,"This album was recorded by Tiny Tim in the mid-80s. It is not one of his better albums. Tiny is the same as he ever was, but the instrumental backing is sub-par. It is mostly synthesized sounds, and Tiny always works better when he has live musicians to play off of. The remake of ""Tiptoe Thru the Tulips"" is far inferior to Tiny's original hit version. Occasionally, Tiny's enthusiasm for these old songs comes through, and his performance overshadows the poor musical backing. But overall, this is not a very good album."
3,"Good, not best","Alot of people dont like this tiny tim album, and with good reason. There are 2 reasons Tiny Tim is famous. His high falsetto voice, and his ukelele. 1st off, the high voice is found only in certain areas, and instead we get a deep baritone. Secondly, Tiny doesnt even touch his ukelele, not even ONCE. Instead we get a synthesized backing band. This was when tiny was struggling to make a comeback and a backing band was hard to come by. Granted, the renditions of these goldie oldies are pretty spot on, but thats part of the reason this album isnt absolutely wonderful. There isnt enough of tiny's unique personality, but its an easy listen."
2,Not worth the ink,This book is NOT worth your time. Outdated and long winded in writing style. I will resell it on Ebay and try to get some of my $$$ back. Nah! I will just junk it.
3,A Decent Read,"I enjoyed this book primarily because it successfully recreates a segment of life during the Middle Ages -- an extremely interesting historical period that is much misunderstood and maligned. There are problems, however. For one thing, the book is too long and padded. Moreover, it does not even remotely approach a top-flight mystery. No, I couldn't figure out who did it (the use of deductive reasoning is pointless here, for there are really no clues with which to work). But I did know who didn't do it. Unlike Agatha Christie, for example, Michael Jecks doesn't know how to reveal the inner thoughts of his characters without revealing their innocence! This, of course, is a major weakness for any mystery writer.The bottom line? This is an enjoyable read, as long as one doesn't expect too much from it."
5,Awesome !!!!!,"This DVD is good,I mean really good. What a great show. Audio and Video are awesome, like being there, specially when you crank it up. Also love the interviews. Heart fans , this is a must have for your collection. Just get it !!!!"
5,Well Orchestrated,"First the set list: Magic Man, Dreamboat Annie (fantasy child), Crazy On You, Soul of the Sea,Dreamboat Annie, White Lightning and Wine, Love Me Like Music (I'll be Your Song), How Deep it Goes, Dreamboat Annie (Reprise), Mistral Wind, Goodbye Blue Sky, Black Dog, Misty Mountain Hop, Love Reign O'er Me. Extras include Heartmongers Speak and a small photo gallery. The show was recorded April 17, 2007, at the Orpheum Theatre in L.A. Ann Wilson's voice is in even finer form than usual! Nancy Wilson's playing is perfect. The rest of the band is also in fine form and the small orchestra accompanying the band enriches and deepens the sound. No band can cover Led Zeppelin live better than Heart, but it is their cover of the Who's ""Love Reign O'er Me that blows you away even more in this show. Must have for Heartmongers!"
4,After 30 Years,"After 30 years these girls can still rock, Ann and Nancy are one of the few performers left in rock that still dedicate amazing energy and passion to their fans. This is a great performance the only con was that the production of this DVD could have been better, interactive menus and bonus material is so so."
5,Awesome purchase,You can't go wrong ordering this!! If you're a true HEART lover...this is a MUST-have!!
4,Dreamboat Annie,It is very interesting seeing a band go back and play an entire album. A must for heart fans.
1,two bad ones.,"First off, was very pleased with amazon's quick response and sending out of new blu ray DVD. Problem was that the two that i received both skipped. Almost in the exact same places. I'm just guessing but think there may have been a bad shipment they may have received. All my other blu ray DVDs play fine. Just happened to be with this only one. A shame since I am a big Heart fan. May try again later."
2,A Turn of phase to the contrary,"Being a reader who likes historical novels with lyrical prose, I was sure this would be a great read. To the contrary, it was a tedious journey to nowhere. Although the author can turn an improbable phrase, she can't tell an engaging story. I made myself finish the novel and was relieved when the end came. I'm sure the author was trying to bring the novel to life in vivid detail but it became lumbersome just plodding through it. In small sections, the book seems to hold promise, but the overall effect is unsatisfying."
5,Breathtaking Prose,"Tripp has done it again! This time in Westport Point, a place described with such exactness, just as in her first memorable novel, Moon Tide, it's a character in an of itself, we meet three generations of beachside inhabitants, beginning with Noel, a former whaler, who's had to readjust for economic reasons and build boats instead of chase whales. The family becomes entangled in the illegal dealings of the rum trade, during Prohibition and everyone's integrity and definition of a just survival is challenged. In addtion to the aptly evoked historical context, there's an undercurrent of seeking true love despite the constraints of class. Tripp gives the reader a rich,texturted story with characters who linger in the reader's mind long after the last word is read. Can't wait for her next novel!"
2,"Well-written froma literary sense, but I hated the plot!","While this book is well written from a literary sense, I did not find the characters realistic (there was virtually no real communication between any of them, and everyone just had to ""guess"" how the others were feeling), nor did I find the plot believable. In fact, I felt it jerked around the emotions of the readers and came up with the most cruel - but improbable - possible way to end the book. The series of events did not follow one from another, and I felt that the author just wanted to evoke an emotional reaction with the murder of one of the main characters, which was neither essential to the plot nor probable."
1,These reviews read like they were put here by someone paid to write them.,"This thing has had a different sound every time I've turned it on, and none of them have been good. It emits a constant buzz whenever something isn't playing, even if it's plugged into a source, and most of the time the sound is too bassy and muted. I say most of the time because every once in a while this thing has stopped acting up, but it's never consistent and it's always annoying. If you plug this into an mp3 player or computer it'll throw a fit unless the source's preamp is turned all the way down. Bottom line: this thing's an amp, and it's not anything more or even good for what it is. Don't buy it. Spend a few extra bucks on something that'll play your music the way it actually sounds."
4,Great for boys,"My 7 year old son really enjoyed this book. Unless your child is an advanced reader, it really takes till first grade before the child can read this on his own. Then you will only have a few words to help him with. The words in bold (like hibernation) are defined in the glossary in the back, which is a nice learning tool. When your child asks what the word means, it is easy to show him how to look up the meaning without getting out a dictionary."
3,Not our first choice,"We recently decided to do a side by side comparison of this acrylic gesso and the Liquitex Acrylic Gesso. Both of those products gave us the sort of coverage and ""toothiness"" we were looking for but the Golden product seemed to generate a lot more tiny bubbles that required additional rolling out to eliminate. We used the same type of roller on both gessoes and both seemed to be similar in density and whiteness but the Golden product took us about a third longer to rollout to the sort of surface consistency we expected. If we didn't roll out these bubbles many of them would go away on their own but the ones that didn't often created small irregularities that we had to sand out once dried."
3,For Developers as well as DBA's,"Very good starting point not only for developers butfor dba's as well. Explanation of Schema is good, this is important for all dba's, with Sql2000 this was quite mixed up concept. DTS, Logins are useful as well.Triggers, Exception Handling, Deprecated Features List are all explained in compact and easy to understand language."
1,Obsolete already,Covers only the first beta of Sql 2005. Many examples don't work. Talks about features not in the product or that work very differently. Also not written for developers. I agree with the other review--it really is for beginners only.
1,"This book stinks, period.","Old build, poor writing style, bad code = bad book.Don't waste your money. Go buy a book from another publisher that teaches you about SQL Server 2005. Better yet, the product documentation is even better than this book!"
2,So-so,Does not go into much detail of specific help for any issues. It discusses some of the new features but since the DB was not released at the time of publication it is a little vague an many of the changes.
3,Man of quotes,I've owned the formidable four volumes in Chinese for almost 20 years and have occasionally dipped into it to see what he was up to. It sure shows his amazing broad reading and erudition but I am yet to be convinced that he was more than the greatest man of quotes and writer of marginalia.
3,they're okay,"they serve the purpose, however, it was hard splitting them apart, they would essentially come apart when tearing one from another"
5,I love this product,"I love this product and would love to find more of it. It appears that this company has gone out of business. If anyone knows where I can buy more, I would love to find it."
2,Nine minutes of harmonica?????????????????,"George Winston's work is always a pleasure to listen to. But I must take issue with his decision to use 8 minutes and 55 seconds of the 29:08 minute CD for, well, harmonica. Now, I like harmonica around the campfire or anywhere outside - live harmonica's different, and can be soulful and plaintive. I even own a harmonica (but don't tell my former choir director that). Solo harmonica on a recording is the equivalent of fingernails on a blackboard...The ""My Country 'Tis of Thee"" was effective - but would have been better played on the slack-key.That being said, the piano and guitar tracks are lovely, and carry a message of hope in this time...Kudos to Mr. Winston for putting this album out and reminding us that beauty exists despite horror."
2,Not his best work,"First: Too much money for too few tracks.Second: What on earth was he thinking with the harmonica?I'm a George Winston fan, but this CD was a disappointment. Worth the money only if you're a sufficient Winston fanatic that you want this CD on principle, to complete your Winston collection. Otherwise, spend the money on a different Winston album, because this one just doesn't display his talent."
1,Icepicks in your ears,"I am a fan of George Winston and usually expect high quality music from this very talened man. But, Remembrance is the worst CD he has created. I kept thinking, ""George Winston did this?"" The piano music is very beautiful but the harmonicas trying to sound like bagpipes is the most painful noise to come out of a speaker. I tried to listed to the CD twice to give it a chance but had to stop when it got to the harmonica noise. The CD is now in my donate to the Goodwill box if anyone would want waste a dollar to buy it. At least my purchase price went to a good cause."
3,Track #5 is the worst - but the others are beautiful..,"I have to agree with the other listener in saying that track #5, which is the ""Farewell, Kindness Emerging, America, My Country 'Tis of Thee and Taps"" has got to be the most annoying song I've ever heard. I bought this CD because Amazon gave me the opportunity to listen to all tracks, but this one. The rest of the CD is absolutely beautiful. The music that I have always recognized as George Winston to be, is heard throughout ""Remembrance"", except this song with the harmonica that last nearly 9 minutes! I believe this CD is worth buying, because the other songs are lovely, but I guarantee you will skip right past track #5."
4,"There is better ""essential"" George","I agree with some of the other reviewers about track 5 (the dreaded harmonica track!) that it really doesn't belong on this CD. For just some reason, it is kind of like grating fingernails on a chalkboard compared to the other tracks. I for one like GW playing guitar. I have seen him in concert many times, and I have always enjoyed him playing slack key. If you are one of the die hard fans of George, you still should invest in this CD. If you are new to him, December, Autumn, Summer, Winter into Spring, or Forest are great first time intro CD's to GW. Still, this is a good effort and for a great cause. I don't regret purchasing it, but he has done better."
1,weak toaster for an upgrade,"As other reviewers pointed out, the bread does not fit into the slots. The slots are too short so that a portion of the bread always sticks out.If the adjustment for light-dark toasting is too high for a particular bread, you can NOT simply stop the toasting. The control lever appears to be electro-magnetic. You have to go and unplug the toaster before it releases!!! How lame is that? Do you want to mess with unplugging and plugging in to control your toaster lever?Too pricey for what you get, and design flaws."
2,Too easy,"After reading some of the glowing reviews, I couldn't wait to try this workout. I was very disappointed with the workout that I got. Didn't even break a sweat and both the boxing and ballet segments were too easy. I'm not super fit either....just trying to get back in shape after having a baby. Caveat....this video would be challenging if you have not done boxing or ballet before. Can't say it's worth the money as I probably won't try this workout again."
2,Not for me,"I read the rave reviews here and on collage, and I couldn't wait to try it.... but nope. It's listed for a resell after one viewing. For me, boxing and ballet do NOT blend well. Some of the ballet moves are pretty fast moving, and as someone who is far from a ballerina, it was fairly tough to keep up.The boxing is... meh. There are better boxing focused DVDs out there (Ilaria, KCM).So, although the concept is very interesting, the reality for me didn't hold up to the hype."
2,"Too easy, not challenging","I had good hopes for this video based on other reviews but found it far too easy. I do regular workouts and have done barre and cardio boxing. The segments are too short. At the end, they suggest you start over and do it again. I would have to do it 2-3 times to get the type of exercise I want and I just don't have time for that."
4,What's to say... it works,"This is a sturdy tire gauge that seems to be pretty accurate and consistent. I use this to check how my snow tires are doing, as well as checking for uneven wear across my tires. Mine didn't seem too oily as others have mentioned, and the numbers are a little difficult to read due to the color scheme."
5,quite happy with this tire tread gauge,"There is not a lot to say about a gauge, but it works perfect and is inexpensive. I love it."
4,Useful,"Works fine, didn't have any drama with oil or anything. A useful and easy to use tool for all tires."
4,"Oily, but it's cheap and it works.","Oily, but it's cheap and it works. Because of the oil on the shaft, I store it with the shaft completely compressed."
4,works,"pros-it works.-it feels like an expensive pen-fair price /w free shippingcons-the measurement marks aren't all in one line, so you have to turn the cylinder to read exact measurement.-it's shipped drenched in oil. i ragged down everything except inside cylinder...at least i know it won't dry out any time soon!"
4,A little hard to read,"Got this to try to extend the life on my motorcycle tires by adjusting the air to keep the tread depth similar on the middle of the tire and on the sides. It appears I was running too much air and the middle tread was wearing faster than the sides. The gauge is simple and straight forward, however, the scale goes around the cylinder that goes in and out, so if you measure tread depth at one point on the tire, you have to turn the gauge around to read tread depth at another point on the tire if it is more, or less, than the first reading. Also, while you can ""guestimate"" the depth (good enough for personal use) by reading the lines on the gauge, I would just go for one of the digital depth gauges if I had to buy one again."
4,Nice little gauge,Nice handy little gauge to keep in the vehicle along with a tire pressure gauge. Lets you check the tire wear so you have an idea when to get your tires rotated. Same one the mechanics at the shop were using.
5,good quality and simple to use,It is a very good tool to buy a used tire. It is small to store it in your car.
4,"basic, but does the job","Nothing exciting about this gauge. It's built of decent quality. Small enough to keep in your glove compartment. The numbers on the gauge appear to be painted on, so I wouldn't be surprised if the numbers begin to fade away from friction against the gauge after years of use. But you can't go wrong with this product."
2,Tire Tread Gage,"This device has multiple, confusing, scales for measuring tread depth. After you decipher using the appropriate scale, it provides an accurate reading, but the effort it takes to calibrate it properly makes it more trouble than it's worth. There have to be other devices that are easy to use and read results."
5,Easy to use and functional,"This gauge is very easy to use, and provides quick determination of tread depth for each tire. One does not need anything more expensive than this item for its intended purpose."
2,has potential but not accurate,I dont like this because while technically it does measure in 1/32 increments... it has 4 positions that have 4/32 increments each.. its really stupid i dont understand why not just make one scale with 1/32 increments.its cheap and probably better to get a better one.
4,Ehhh,Does the job. It's what you need for checking tire tread depth. Better made than most of them! I would buy it again!
4,"Convenient, easy to use, cheap","For the price of this item and how quick/easy to use it is, I am very happy not to have to fiddle with pennies and president's heads and other ways of ""estimating"" tread wear. We all can see when we are at or close to wear bars on tires, but these are nice because they allow for closer monitoring of the rate of wear throughout the life of the tire. It is easy to use, gets quick results, and allows for accurate and consistent measurements, unlike other approximation methods.Four stars instead of five because on mine there is some rough metal-on-metal scratching going on when moving the measuring part up and down in the holder-chamber. It is making some scratches on the numbers I need to read and if I used this extensively, I could see that becoming a problem over time."
3,Just another way to check tire wear,"This isn't the easiest tool to use in tight spots, and it's not particularly easy to read, but it gets the job done."
4,tread gauge,"i i ever gave out 5 star this would be the one. simple, well made, easy to read. i had a tire i thought would be good for resale but ended up taking 5 bucks for the tire."
2,"For the grammar-phile, not the everyday lawyer.","This book is intensely and heavily focused on sentence-level English; grammar and punctuation receive the most attention. No one can question that, because lawyers are professional writers, we ought to understand English at the sentence level. But this book offers so much detail that it is difficult to get through. Most lawyers can learn to write correctly and effectively without understanding grammar at the level of an English Ph.D.Plus, practical advice for preparing legal documents is sparse. There is nothing on citation, use of authority, legal analysis, or document format. And the book is not a lively, entertaining read. I found it slow-going at times."
1,for laughs only,"It's hard to believe this is what the TOHO company has sunk too. Mothra looks like someone went down to their local department store, bought a fuzzy chew toy for dogs, brought it home and sewed some wings and legs on it. That can be the only work the ""monster"" makers did. Even funnier and more ridiculous that megalon with his dremel drill bit arms.Then there's the atrocious acting and plot, the dumb fat kid and the equally dumb and ugliest girl I've ever seen on screen. This ain't no Godzilla vs Hedorah or Rodan. Watch this on satellite if you must but don't waste money on it."
4,Mothra is back,"I'm a relatively new fan of Toho Kaiju (especially Godzilla), so I decided to try out one of Toho's movies outside of Godzilla. This was my first choice, so I bought it. Here is my opinion on itPros:The famous Mothra Song is retained in this film.I give it 7 out of 10 for originality.Desghidorah (or Death Ghidorah) is well done (though, he does sound like an elephant).The Mothra marionette of this film is one of their somewhat better efforts.Mothra Leo is well designed.Cons:The Mothra Twin Fairies' evil twin sister's laugh can get annoying real quick.The kids in this film are whiny, disrespectful brats (Parents with imitative kids beware).Garu-Garu?!The special effects leave a lot to be desired. Toho is capable of better special FX than this, a fact proven by the Heisei Godzilla series that they had just finished.Bottom Line:Despite all of these flaws, this should be enjoyable to fans of Godzilla, Mothra, or any Toho Kaiju."
1,What a Disappointment!,"We bought this one after seeing ""Godzilla and Mothra"". The kids fell in love with the tiny women who called themselves ""Cosmos"", and especially loved their Mothra song. We were hoping for more of that poignant sweetness here. Forget it! The evil sister made no sense, and the movie was just gory and pointless. Not for kids!"
3,Aqua Mothra to the rescue,This is the second series but not that Last Because the Mothra battles KING GIDORAH in the last saga (not for sale in the U.S.)But Mothra flick was alright but Monster really didn't play good role in here because it seems they focus on the kids really then on the monsters.Mothra enemy is very tough to beat up and through out the fight mothra gets his butt whip not until he gotenergy from the furby looking creature.But overal its a good kiddy flicks fore kids.
5,Mothra,This movie was really awesome I thought that death-ghidorah was a really huge monster looking so big that it looked like he was about 1 kilometer in height because in a far distance he could be seen and he is still I liked it when mothra leo defeated Death-ghidorah. this movie was really cool
4,lots of fun!!,"My kids loved this movie...and so did I!! very colorful fantasy film that is a welcome break from all the bad,unimaginative films for kids! I found myself enjoying it as much as they did. I only wish the dubbing was better. but I still liked it alot!!! Nice special effects too!"
2,This was a prety good movie but....,This was a prety good movie but it was a stupid story to get the kids of Japan into Godzilla and his side kicks to boust saules.
4,Rebirth of Mothra,"A very good movie.My whole family really enjoyed it,even my wife who thinks my taste for jappenese monster movies is childish.To bad Godzilla wasn't in it,then it would be perfect."
5,mothra 3,This movie was really cool I have the third movie REBIRTH OF MOTHRA 3 KING GHIDORAH ATTACKS this movie is so cool you will see mothra batttle CURRENT KING GHIDORAH the ghidorah that was wished to faced godzilla in 1991's godzilla vs king ghidorah and watch mothra battle ANCIENT KING GHIDORAH.
5,The Story of the Christian Science Monitor,"Mary Baker Eddy, in her 80s, started the Christian Science Monitor to give real journalism to the country and eventually to the world. At the time, yellow journalism, or tabloid news was so widespread that fair reporting was hard to come by. This is a very interesting book filled with history and insight that proved to be true and valuable to the country and sometimes to the world. It also shows that things have not changed much in the past 100 years. Politicians are still doing business the same way.[...]"
2,Bad Reaction,"I bought this product based on me having used other MD Formulations products including the Basic Facial Cleanser and loving the way my skin looks; however when I used this Sensitive Skin Formula I got a very bad reaction. My face broke out with bumps on my cheeks and forehead (a bad case of cosmetic contact dermatitis). My face felt and looked like it was small bubble wrap. I am sure that this is a wonderful product based on my previous use of other MD Formulations but definitely not for me. Needless to say I returned the product. Since that experience, I purchased the MD Formulations Basic Facial Cleanser and have not had a reaction. With having said that, I believe that there were some botanical ingredient(s) in the Sensitive Skin Formula that I had the reaction to. I would not hesitate to purchase this or any MD Formualtions product but if your skin easily reacts to certain ingredients like botanicals, please be cautious."
5,Give it a try!,This product was recommended to me by another user and I decided to give it a try. I have sensitive skin and it is a bit on the oily side. After just a few days my skin was noticably cleaner - the pores look better and my skin is not shiny by day's end. I have been using their other products in conjunction with the cleanser so I do not know if this product alone is responsible for the results. Worth a try.
5,facial cleaner - MD formulations ss,Love this product. Recommended by spa and love it. A friend of mine uses it as well and love it as well.
1,Be careful,Please be careful. My wife used this product and received a severe facial chemical burn. Consult a doctor before using.
4,the source,"great item; note, however, that no dust cover was sent. perhaps i should have known but it wasn't a big deal to me as all i wanted to do was read the book...."
2,"The author's last book, but not his best","I'm fairly certain _The End Of The Dream_ is Phillip Wylie's last book; alas, it is not one of his best. Although it contains some unforgetable imagery, the thread holding everything together is frayed and breaks in places. Still, the plane crash into the Regency Towers, the Antarctic exploitation, and the mass deaths due to bad air vividly illustrate his theme of the horrors coming from environmental abuse - particularly his ""vibes"", which will stay with long after you'd like."
4,Spooky look into the then future,"It is easy to say he was too paranoid *now*, but then it seemed very possible--and still, much of the book seems quite 'possible'.It is a fast read and pretty cool if you are into well-written sci fi."
5,Out of the Blue,"Not being familiar with Boise State or even that part of the country, I enjoyed looking deeper into the program that suddenly came to the upper echelon of big-time college football with its bowl game victory over Oklahoma a few years back. This documentary was well done and exposes the ins and outs of a program that does things the right way. I would recommend it to any football fan. As a high school coach I'm always looking for documentaries on little known schools that have made it big. This particular video didn't just cover the season game by game, but rather looked closer at some of the players, coaches, and the philosophy of being a Bronco."
5,Awesome for any BSU fan!!!,Great show My husband says it is a must see for any BSU fan. He is loving it. I ordered it for him for X-mas. It was delivered quickly and I also received a digital copy on Amazon. So cool!!!
3,50 Fab Parties for Kids,"The book delivers on its title. It is broken down into 3 age groups and a section of holiday and family events. Each party includes introductory suggestions, a cake, some things to do and an invitation. Some also have ideas for costumes or favors. Nearly all of the ideas are inexpensive things you can do at home.The themes are familiar, and lots of the games are well-known, but the cake ideas alone may be worth the price of the book. Nothing here is remarkably different, but it's a great ""catalogue"" to select a theme from and gives no-nonsense advise to make a fun party."
5,Men Behaving Badly - Series 5,I am a big fan on Martin Clunes and wanted to see the series that brought him fame. As a woman it took me a while to get used to the episodes. I really love them now and get a big kick out of the dancing at the end of each episode.
5,really works,"After years of struggling with lit circles, I checked this book out from my new school's library. I didn't have to read the whole thing to find what I needed -- a really great step-by-step guide on how to implement lit circles into my classroom while still maintaining good classroom management. I used Daniels' techniques in a third grade class and it went very well. I was very impressed."
5,Literature Circles--Voice and Choice in the Student Centered Classroom,"Excellent book on how to implement literature circles in your classroom. Lots of room for personal choice in how to implement, and also targets various grade levels. Examples from classrooms are provided."
1,Warning! Buy the Newer Edition!,"2009 Wisconsin State Reading Association conference. Harvey Daniels himself told me in person NOT to buy this version of the book because it contains errors, things he regrets are circulating among educators. He said absolutely to buy the newer edition, the one with the dark pink cover. Here's the link:Literature Circles"
3,"Decent Book, Just out of date now","This book reads really well. Since first reading this book, I have been hoping for an update to this book for a while.Intellij is one of those products that, while excellent, is really different than Eclipse or, say, Net Beans. In fact, coming from one of these other environments, you may not notice how great a product intellij actually is.A book like this one really helps to bridge the gap when trying to learn this comprehensive IDE.Authors -- Can we get an updated book soon that covers things like Android programming and other more up to-to-date material?"
5,La Bete Humaine,A really slick movie. I didn't know anything about it but took a chance on buying it and am very glad I did. Good pic.
3,Sound and fury,"An extremely gritty adaptation of one of Zola's most intense novels. The sequences down the Paris - Le Havre track are superbly evocative of the main characters' inability to escape their destiny. Character-wise, though, the film takes a while to get going, and the scene of Lantier's (Gabin's) first blackout and possession by ""the beast within"" is contrived, poorly acted and not at all convincing. Things improve, thankfully. Updating the plot to the 1930s doesn't quite work in the sense that the protagonists' difficult living conditions in the novel are an important cause of their actions. With one noteable exception, the score is 1930s over-intrusive. And why oh why did Renoir change Zola's ending, which is far more powerful than the film's ho-hum-is-it-over? final scene."
3,"Interesting foray into Zola's naturalism classic, good cast.","Jean Gabin wanted to make a movie about trains. The result was the Bete Humaine. It is a good production which suffers, mainly, from a poor score (it is hard to imagine a poor Renoir film with Gabin). The cast is excellent but the plot suffers from Zola's naturalist bent. Railfans will love the beginning which takes place in the cab of a French State Railway locomotive on a run from Paris to La Havre. The actress Simon plays the female lead well (she is best rememberd in the U.S. for Cat People). Not in the same league as The Rules of the Game but well worth watching."
3,"Weird film, but the ride on the train was great","Jean Renoir made his version of Zola's novel. What is fun here is the fabulous sights we see while on the train thru France. Beatiful b&w; photography, mind you.Now, the story I didn't quite get it. I didn't get to care too much about the afflicted engineer; his psyche is really weird to me. Then there's his relationship with the unorthodox femme fatal, for whom I didn't care much either. So the study of characters isn't the best one I've seen in film history.In brief, boring but beautiful. There are better Renoir films to choose from."
4,a nice French movie by a great director,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.La Bte humaine, or the Human Beast is the story of a train conductor who he accidentally kills his girlfriend.The film is directed by world renowned director, Jean Renoir and Stars Jean Gabin who previously worked with Renoir in films such as The Grand Illusion.The DVD contains antroduction by Renoir, an interview with Peter Bogdanovich, a theatrical trailer, and footage of Renoir directing the film.This is a nice film and I recommend it for fancs of early French cinema."
4,"Information, Ideas, and Inspiration--all in one little book!","I'm not a fundraiser--I'm a donor, and I stumbled on this book while looking for advice on how to choose worthy charities to support. What an eye-opener it is. Now I'm going to offer this book to fundraisers who approach me with tired old pitches.What an eye-opening pleasure to find a book so direct and plain-talking and generous with its genuinely practical advice. If you're raising money, you'll learn here how to make targeted, carefully crafted appeals that produce results. If you're giving money or time, this book works in reverse to help you choose intelligently how to help others do their good works."
