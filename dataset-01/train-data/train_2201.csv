1,"Not effective, since it has power source to keep steam activated","This inhaler is pretty simple - put some hot water in a container with a vicks pad or vicks VapoSteam and slap an inhaler over it. Works for about 5 minutes until the water gets too cool to produce steam, then you must repeat steps. Too much work for too little return. I'm ditching this for the electric personal inhaler, which I'm sure will work more like a big vaporizer (huge fan of those big ones, but very difficult to drag room to room with you)."
2,"NOT a ""STEAM inhaler""","This is probably fine for inhaling the Vick's medicated vapors to clear your sinuses. If you're looking for something that makes steam, look elsewhere. This is just an elaborate cup that holds hot water..."
1,Not recommended at all,"I bought this because it said that is a steam product, ITS NOT.Its just uses a hot tap water, and it doesn't steam at all. Its just a waste of money."
2,For VERY young kids only,"It is almost useless. If you would trust your youngest child withhot chocolate invest in a good one with a power cord, or at least batteries.But it might be useful if you have a child under 5 that would burn themselves with a real steamer."
1,waste of money,"enev one star is two high a rating,,,it is cheaply made and will not last very long,,, very difficult to use"
1,Garbage,"Who ever wrote the 4 and 5 star reviews of this junk must work for Vick's.It's only purpose is to sell their aroma-Therapy pads, etc.Buy the V1200 electric model. It works well."
4,A Dance in Deep Water,"I would expect this book to be wonderful ~ His previous two stories in this fascinating series are well-written. They take place IN as well as around the Great Lakes. Although I eagerly purchased this book from the secondary market a few years ago, the book failed to arrive. Mr. Allyn is a local author and one I enjoy. I may just need to buy it again."
4,Does the job,"A nicely priced item and with a little oomph behind it, does the job for it's intended purpose."
2,Nothing Exceptional Here,"There is really nothing exceptional here with this collection of non-soundtrack James Bond film music. I was disappointed. THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE come off best. THUNDERBALL is not bad. However, the rest were pretty standard. Hit and miss."
4,What a visual journey!,"""A Visual Journey of Wartime Patriotism United We Stand"" by Richard J. Perry is an outstanding piece on World War II. I reccomend it as a must see for anyone interested in WWII. It presents a stunning display of images, as well as some interseting and insightful tidbits of text. I am excited to use this book in my social studies classroom."
3,"An acceptable toy at a ""bargain"" price","This is an ""amusing"" toy. It certainly cannot be said to be capable of anything approaching PRECISION flight control (not even indoors in totally calm air). For less than $25., it is worthwhile to play with. Were it offered at the suggested retail price, I wouldn't consider it desirable."
1,Didn't work...,"""Santa"" bought this for my son for Christmas. It didn't work. Return was easy & I got my credit fast though! So, it wasn't a horrible experience besides my son being upset it didn't work."
2,Disappointed,The Rider X helicopter I purchased for my grandson seemed at first to be a fun toy and he quickly learned how to maneuver it around the house. However three days after receiving this helicopter it no longer accepted a charge from the transmitter as it is supposed to do. the transmitter seems to work fine on its six battery power but the rechargeable battery in the copter will no accept a charge. I plan to return this item to the supplier.
3,mini helicopters,"The helicopter flies great and is pretty durable. The main blade has become loose and moves up to the top blade when flying, have been unable to get it to stay in place. This occurred after only flying it a few times. Could improve the blade stability."
1,Blah blah blah,"You know those books that done on and on and on after having a beginning that showed some potential, but not much? This is a classic example of that. I read a review that called this book riveting, so I was tricked into going out and buying it. The review was right . It was riveting if you consider riveting to be that you need rivets to hold you down to keep you from getting up and never picking up this atrocious display of a book ever again. After the first chapter, I took a nap. Midway through the second chapter, if my eyeballs could throw up, I knew they would have after reading a mockery of all books ever written. Howeve it got past the publisher, I'll never know. This book doesn't deserve one star, it deserves negative 57. Ultimately, this bad excuse for a piece of literature is good for anyone who is looking for a book to make fun of. My summary of the book is, ""Don't bother reading this book. IT SUCKS"""
4,"Shark Trouble, without the pictures","If you're a Peter Benchley fan, and haven't read Shark Trouble, then it's for you. Very interesting and informative information and stories. The references are also a good to read. However, it is essentially Shark Trouble without the pictures, and with one extra story."
1,Self-plagiarism?,"My 9-year old son is a shark fanatic, so I buy books about sharks for him. Not long ago I bought a Peter Benchley book named ""Shark Trouble"". This is the exact same book with a different title. I want my money back!"
4,Very Interesting,"Really enjoyed this book. Learned alot, the sea and all it's creatures are incredible. Easy read and will keep you interested."
2,not impressed,"I'm returning these. I wear size 14 and got a large and it's way too small in the waist. Material is ok, not great. The fact that you can snip to the desired length is a plus."
4,pettipant slip,This slip is nice and short. It keeps your legs from rubbing together if you want to go without pantyhose. The delivery time was fantastic! Couldn't be happier!
1,You get what you pay for......,"The pettipants I purchased are made of very thin material. You can see right through them which makes the idea of wearing them almost nil. The sizes also run small, so make sure to order larger than you normally wear. I wish now I had purchased a more expensive brand. Maybe the quality would have been better but as I have always been told.....you get what you pay for."
4,Humorous and whopping good Sci-Fi,"This book is humorous as other Pohl novels (although this is a bit more light-hearted as well). The novel takes place in a nearish-future world, where the US and Russia pretty much left each other defenseless after years of warring; because they no longer had defense, and other countries were affected too, the densely populated China and India took over the world easily (in a non-ridiculous kind of way).Thus the stage is set; I don't feel like just ripping of the back of the book's summary so I'll just say this: Pohl's humorous touch adds spice to this Sci-fi novel with an interesting look on the future. The back cover said it's also an important message to mankind, but I don't know... judge for yourself, if you can find this book at a used bookseller. Four stars, because I don't want to give it a ""perfect rating."""
4,"Interesting, insightful, makes one think.",Dr.Carl Baugh is amazing. His team of researchers are like no other. I highly recommend viewing this tape. It shows that the Creation Model can be proven through science.
2,Title is missleading,"I knew when I ordered it that they were joking somewhat when they said how to beat your dad. I expected a book that showed you how to open, how to use endgames and general tactics in addition to checkmating. The only thing it teaches is checkmating. But then how do I do all of the stuff needed to get to the checkmate? The book should say, ""how to use checkmates to beat your dad"". Then you know what you are getting."
2,Just an ok book on tactics,"If you haven't looked over some of the other books on chess tactics you might think this book is great. One of the things to be considered when reviewing a book is how it compares to other ones covering like material.To start off with this book only concentrates on 50 checkmate ideas. It has limited material, which is what I consider to be major drawback. If you don't mind English Descriptive Notation then ""1001 Brilliant Checkmates"" by Reinfeld has a lot more material or if you are looking for very simple checkmates then get ""Simple Checkmates"" by Gillam. However, my favorite book, covering the most important checkmates and other important tactics as well is ""Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors"". All of these books work much better!"
3,"Good book, but not so much for beginners or little kids","Because my kids would like nothing more than to beat their dad at chess, I got this book for my 7 and 4 year old sons. The book does a great job explaining different types of mating patterns, but the explanations are too brief and too abstract for my kids. I learned a lot reading the book, but I'm not sure my kids did. The title makes it seem as if the book is for young children. It is really for intermediate to advanced players. For them, this is a great book. For little ones, I would not recommend it."
3,My kids loved the cover but really didn't want to get into the text!,"My children LOVED (and I mean LOVED!) the cover saying and artwork but the book never enticed them to sit down and read it on their own. It is, overall, in my opinion a good book and I suppose I shouldn't expect a book to do what I should be doing for me (as enticing as that sounds!) but I had hoped it would grab their attention a little better than it did."
5,Easy to understand,"My chess teacher advised each player in the class to get a copy.What a book!! Before reading this I had no idea that pattern recognition was so important, or how easy it could be to learn some fantastic checkmating techniques.The content is based on grandmaster games, yet the positions are explained so that anyone - junior or adult - can understand them very easily."
2,Poor Dad Must be Bad!,"This book must assume your dad is really bad at chess. It has problems to work on with checkmates. But most games aren't won or lost because you overlook a neat checkmate problem. Most games are won or lost because you first lose material then when the checkmate is easy to set up you go ahead and win.The checkmate problems are ok, but this is the end result of what you get when you use other strategy to win."
3,Moderately decent coverage of Checkmate Tactics,"I own a lot of chess books. My dad has over 500! So it is easy for me to compare chess books on different parts of chess.This book concentrates on one narrow type of tactic - CHECKMATE PROBLEMS. It has 50 ideas on checkmates.The good point of this book is that the author is accurate and doesn't make mistakes. This a an important point.The weakness of the book is that it doesn't have as much material as other books in my father's library such as the Art of the Checkmate and 1001 Brilliant Checkmates. Actually I like, for learning tactics just beyond the beginning level or for the intermediate player, ""Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniiors"", by Snyder. This is a wonderful book.So overall ""How to beat your dad at chess is fair""."
3,Fun but limited book,"I enjoyed the puzzels with checkmates - one of many decent books covering basic checkmate situations. My favorite, and a better book is ""Art of the Checkmate"" even though it is in English Descriptive notation."
3,They don't aways work but some good stuff anyway,"I got this book. My dad didn't fall for all but one of these checkmates. But then I was happy. I tried them all, but he would get me down too much to use any of them so I think just the beginners book for juniors worked better anyway. I did get him in the backrank one because he was upset by my little sister tossing stuff when she didn't get her way and he was not paying attention. I got a beginners book for juniors and and a traps book and both worked better. I now beat my dad more than half the time."
3,Moderate Checkmate Patters to Learn,"I guess I am more into the ""workbook"" type of books for learning tactical patterns such as ""1001 Brilliant Checkmates"" by Reinfeld or ""Combination Challenge"" by Hays.However, ""How to Beat your Dad at Chess"" is a better than average chess book. It could use MORE PROBLEMS to work on, which perhaps is my only complaint, but a good one!"
5,Great book!,I encourage people to buy this book. The skills taught in the book are very helpful and easily taught explained.
2,This books has some mistakes and teaches HOPE chess,"This book is our our school library. I have enjoyed going over the checkmated problems. This book has too many mistakes because for some of the problems to work the purson getting checkmated need to make very bad moves. I have been told by my chess teacher not to play HOPE chess, and that you need to look for the best moves on both sides. This book teaches that bad habit of playing HOPE chess because bad moves must be made for the answers to work in some of the positions. But it is still fun to look at the positions."
2,dougv,The checkmates are mostly too hard for beginners.Book not useful for most children. I found the mates often too hard to follow.The book is well bound with high quality paper.
1,How To Beat Your Dad at Chess,"This was Not the book I needed to help my 9-yr old grandson advance from the beginning level of chess playing. It is much too complex. I hadn't played in years when I first taught him to play a few months ago. We both really needed something much less complicated. The reviews I read made it sound like anyone could follow it but we did Not find that to be the case. I would have returned it if my son hadn't already trashed the bag! Oh well, perhaps my grandson will grow into it--in another 20 years?How to Beat Your Dad at Chess (Gambit chess)"
1,Not what I expected,"This book was purchased for a beginner six-year-old who wanted to ""beat his dad at chess,"" but was inappropriate for a very young beginner. Very little introduction, description of the rules of the game, or descriptions of basic piece movement. Book pretty much leapt into diagrams of mid-game board setups and specific combinations of moves to attack or respond as the board dictates.Not recommended for a young beginner. Working knowledge of the game and experience necessary to make use of this book."
4,Beating Dad at chess,This book is an excellent read for children and adults starting off their journey into the world of chess. Amazon should be commended.It is interesting that strategies are so dependent on memorising pieces from previous games. Therefore to be really good at chess it is essential to have an excellent memory.
4,Fun to learn from,"I found this book fun to learn from. I recommend it for anyone who is not a grand master who wants to learn to checkmate good. You should get this book along with Reinfeld's ""1001 Brillant Checkmates"", Hays's ""Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors"" and Snyder's ""Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors"". All of these books are just great!The reason I game this book 4 stars instead of 5 is simply because I felt it could have had more of the good stuff it already has in it - maybe they will make a second follow up volume?"
3,"Not Bad, Not Great It Teaches Checkmate!",Like my other book called 1001 Brilliant Ways to Checkmate (by Fred Reinfeld) this book has checkmate patterns to learn all about.Unlike the other book mentioned this book explanes more about checkmating patterns. But doesn't have as many exampels. I suggest getting both of them to be complete.
2,Rather Skimpy,"I found this book to have some good ""how to checkmate"" problems in it (why 2 stars instead of one). But the ""bang for the buck"" is why I don't like it. It dosnot have nearlly enough in it.I have the book ART OF THE CHECKMATE that I feel is much, much,much better and it is sold on Amazon.com. Get ART OF THE CHECKMATE instead and you will not go wrong. It is even better set up to understand, idea by idea, theme by theme if you get what I mean!"
5,Excellent book for any beginner...,"This book belongs in every beginner's chess library - kid or adult. It explains, in simple terms and with easy to understand diagrams, 50 checkmate patterns. These are essential building blocks for any developing chess player."
4,"Unfortunately, it worked","My 9 year old stayed up all night for several nights studying this book. I just lost my third game in a row to him, the little b@$tard."
3,Not really all that great,"I own the ""Art of the Checkmate"" which is on checkmates. If you must have a book on checmates in the algebraic notation then you must have the DAD book. But if you want a book that does a better job and can do the old notation then get ""Art of the Checkmate"". OK MATE!"
3,Some Good Checkmates,This book has some good checkmate positins to learn from. I would like to see more postions in the book so maybe it is going to be put out with a second one. It needs more positions in it is the problem as it is too short.
3,Learned some new checkmates but this book is not for beginners (tha's for sure!),I found the teaching of checkmates in this book to be hard for me because I am a advanced beginner. So I would suggest this book for more advanced players. A beginner should get a beginner book. [...]
3,Learn how to checkmate,The book teaches how to checkmate and gives problems to do that. It was fun to go through the book. I wish there was more and that is why I feel it should not get more stars as it could have been thicker with more stuff. That is I went through it quikly and felt that there should have been more inside.
1,Gimicky book of little real teaching value,"If this book inspires your children to play chess, then it can't be all bad. However, don't expect your kids to suddenly start winning more games or tournaments - unless they are only playing against rank amateurs. Others here have listed better books - take their advice. While they generally contain good information and are more or less accurate, Snyder's works reek of rampant self-promotion and cheap gimicks."
4,Fun Puzzel book,This book is a fun puzzel book to learn from. It teaches you how to checkmate and that is a very important part of winning!This book should be added to other tactics books to learn from.
3,Checkmate Positions to Work on,"This book covers checkmate positions and gives some interesting ideas. It does not go beyond that but does alot better job than bobby fisher teaches chess that I just reviewed too. It should have other tactics and the title does not tell you really what it does cover. This book is ok, but not as good at the book ""Art of the Checkmate""."
4,BANG'N,I found this rap record hiding in the bin at TOWER . This CD has not left my CD for the whole weekend. My neck is sore from moving with the solid beat. Don't miss out on it. Glad I found it.
3,Nice Product,"This is a great cable for using an off-camera flash w/o having to buy a wireless setup. It is a bit pricey, but it worked for me up until the point that I lost it..."
5,"Excellent, thoughtfull and insightfull","This is a wonderfull book which provides you with usefull tools that can effect and enrich your daily life. It is non-judgemental, loving a truely inspirational read which does not condesend but is uplifting and really applicable to our lives today. I loved this book and I am ordering more copies to give to my friends!"
5,Camera Accessories,There were more items in the shipment than expected! Excellent value for the price. I would recommend this to any buyers.
1,"Waste of Money, Bad Company","This product doesn't keep air out. My food went stale almost immediatly. I have ordered from Organize-everything 3 different times, each time hoping to get my money's worth. It never happened. Bad, bad, BAD prices and shipping takes forever. They even lost my credit card number, but somehow managed to charge me twice. THis company is shady, and I don't recommend this particular product. Maybe try it from somewhere else where you can physically test it out. Don't waste your hard earned money."
4,A nice clock....,"Got this one for my little girl's room. I'm specifically looking for something in white wood since it matches my daughter's bedrooom set. They were quick to deliver as always but mine seemed to be stopping all the time, like the two hands getting stucked together. Made the complaint online and easy return. The following day or two, got a new one. Never had a problem with this one and I'm happy..."
4,GOOD MOVIE,HAD HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS HARD TO FIND MOVIE. A GOOD SCARY MOVIE THAT WAS IN GREAT CONDITION. JUST AS DESCRIBED.
2,A very detailed book,This book explains mainly the lineage of the mastiff. Pretty tedious. Nothing about the temperament of the dog.
1,"Too much history, not enough management","Very detailed history of the breed but limited information about breed management. As a new Mastiff owner, I was more interested in chacteristics of the breed (health, training, etc)."
4,an incredible composition,"The song ""a ton etoile"" (to your star) is gripping & beautiful. Have you heard a cello mixed into modern rock? It works -- the song is one of the best I know: the lyrics are simple & moving; orchestration is balanced and the feeling expressed is so right on. If you're sad, you'll recover with this song."
5,French Rocks,"I learned about this CD in French 101, and it's one of the best CDs I've heard. It doesn't matter that it's in French because the music is so awesome. It's really too bad it isn't more popular in America."
3,"Good book, for people with alot of time.","This book is good for learning computer science,and Pascal, but not fast. If you plan on buying this book, prepair to spend a long time with it. (also it is used at schools)"
3,"Works, could be better","The lid lifter works, but to get the T-bar to hold the lid steady and not dump the ashes into the meal puts the lifter at an awkward angle to lift the lid. It would be nice if there were a way to have it stand up on the ground when not in use."
4,Help with hot hands,I love the idea of getting away from the heat with this product. I thought it would be a little longer. Wish it was. But love the lifter over all.
1,Poor design considering alternatives for the same price,"These one-piece lid lifters are prone to dumping ash in the food. They're better than nothing, but don't grip the lid tighly.They don't grip the lid firmly like the good lifters (with the three legs and the hook operated by gripping the handle). The good lid lifters retail for about the same price as this lifter. There's no reason to buy this design. They will will put a huge smile on your face the first time you discover you don't have to do any kind of balancing act.I've been looking on Amazon, but for some odd reason it looks like they don't carry the good lid lifters, which are available at any outdoors store that carries dutch ovens. Please Amazon, offer the three-leg+hook lifters, sometimes called ""deluxe"" lifters!"
5,Dutch Oven Lid Lifter,"OK... Now that you're looking at things that work... Here's another thing that's well worth the money. Simply put: If you have the Dutch oven or are ordering one, let me suggest this as your first ""enhancement."" Lids get hot. Buy the lifter."
4,It serves its purpose,I just received this and it appears to be of a level of quality you would expect from Lodge. I just wish it was a little longer so that your hands are not quite so close to the fire.
4,Nice to have...,"You can cook almost anything in a dutch oven with or without the Lid Lifter. Assuming you're outside, a branch will probably do the same job. Nevertheless, The lifter is well built and provides a solid lifting mechanism for the heavy lids. If you're lugging arround a dutch oven than the additional weight of this lifter won't make much of a difference."
4,A useful tool,"This is one of those items that is not a pre-requisite for dutch oven cooking, it does take up valuable space, but how can you leave home without it? I have used everything from a pair of pliers to wire coat hangars to leather gloves. This is the tool you go for every time. You have CONTROL over your lids and pots when opening or moving them. Don't leave home without it."
5,Definitely a must have,"If you are buying a dutch oven for the first time, don't skimp and not buy the lid lifter. It is well worth the money. I would recommend practing with it to get the hang of how to use it, especially with coals on the lid. Last thing you want to happen is ashes falling into your food because your lid was off balance and it twisted on you (almost happend once :) ) It is not hard to use, and is a great addition to your dutch oven. Works great once you figure out the balancing.."
3,Made in CHINA,"We try to buy USA made products. We purchased a LODGE dutch oven made right here in the USA in Tennessee and assumed the LODGE dutch oven lid lifter would be also. Surprise! It was packaged in a plastic sleeve with large print MADE IN CHINA. Sure the lifter does what is intended, but I would have paid more to buy it made in USA. Should have done that at Silver Dollar City. They make them right there in the park. Just wish it would have told of this on the description page. But again, it does what it is intended for."
3,Dutch Oven Lid Lifter,The quality is not that great (made in China). It is not welded together straight. I straightened it out with a big hammer and an anvil so it works OK now. Getting it to work right on two different dutch ovens was problematic also.
5,Lodge Lid Lifter,"Lifter works exactly as it should, you can leave it on the lid while you are cooking and it doesn't get hot"
4,it works!!,"The lid lifter really works and sure helps when you have several dutch ovens going at the same time to check on the different dishes cooking. The hardest thing is keeping track of where it is, don't lose it."
2,Shipping PAIN,"I purchased two lanyards and they are great. I can use it for my phone, mp3 player, and my digital camera. The cost for the product has suited me well, although the shipping costs were terrible. The lanyards arrived together for twice the cost of one. I only use one lanyard at a time, and I can remove my mp3 without taking it off. Pretty long string. Low rating for shipping costs."
2,Item did not match picture!,Lanyard received did NOT match the picture at all. Mine was much thicker and had a huge clip like something that belongs on a backpack strap. Not appropriate for an USB drive at all. Might work better for a large item like a camera. Returned.
4,Camera Soft Neck Strap,"I like to have small cameras and cell phones on a strap like this. I have always used Canon's Metal Neck Strap, also found at Amazon. What I like about this one is that I can unclip the item without removing the strap from my neck. I generally use a neck strap while doing things like Kayaking where I can just pull the camera out of my vest and shoot one handed and then stuff it back into the vest. An advantage with small cameras like the Canon Elph Class point and shoot cameras is the fact that you have this nice HANDLE to assist you when shooting. Recently shooting hummingbirds I held the camera with my right hand and held the end of the neck strap in my left hand. As I extended ther camera outward I held back on the neck strap tightly. The camera stayed so rock solid the shots were fabulous. Cloth doesn't last as long as the metal Canon strap so that is why there are 4 stars here. Otherwise item works well. Robert"
5,K.I.S.S.,"K.I.S.S. = keep it simple, stupid.i bought my girl a camera awhile ago. she took some pictures, but not as often as i do. we go on motorcycle trips over the place and i drive. id like to be able to take pictures as we ride, but with both hands on the handlebars, im not really able to do so. enter this camera strap. i got it for her so she could have her new camera around her neck while we were riding. always ready to take pics, and no danger of dropping it on the highway @ 75 mph. we just got back from a 2000 mile trip and she got some amazing shots. nothing really to this strap. its simple. strong. put it on the camera and forget about it. buy one. thats all."
4,Worked great!,"I was really pleased with the lanyard and used it on my camera during a recent vacation. My camera is small and light weight and I was afraid I might drop it. Having it attached to the lanyard erased all concerns. It was strong enough and seemed very secure. The only thing that would have made it better would have been a wider strap. Other than that, it was great!!"
4,Cut the neck strap off and attach to key ring,You can cut the neck strap off and attach that plastic end directly to your key ring! It's the best solution if your USB jump drive did not include a lanyard. Buying this will prevent twisting damage to the small hole found on most USB drives and loss of the drive.
1,Multidapt Neck Strap - tether,This device failed. The fine cord used to adapt to electronic devises has only a knot in it to keep it from pulling through the quick latch...and it fails to prevent pull-out. Apparently the hole in the plastic latch mechanism is to large. I bought three of them at the same time...all had low pull out force failure that is insufficient for the value of the electronic items to be attached.
1,Never use it.,"This Krusell Multi Detach Neckstrap/LanyardWith Cell/USB Lariat. is probably one of the cheapest, most flimsy product I have ever bought. I think I gave it away, was not worth keeping. and had no trust in it."
1,Junk!,"Do Not buy this. It is not good quality. While I like the length and the sliding adjuster, the clip is made of delicate plastic parts and it broke the FIRST TIME I attached and then detached it.I got it for my tiny Lumix camera. You don't want a valuable camera or cell phone hanging from this!! This is typical cheap Asian manufactured crap."
5,Perfect for camera,Ordered so I could keep my camera around my next but wanted something with a quick release strap. This was the right price and works great!
4,Attractive price- needs locking length adjustment,"Product is what I expected, but seems to be better made than expected. The only thing I missed was a spring-loaded length adjustment. I replaced the bead with a spring-type strap adjuster commonly found on nylon stuff sacks."
5,Multi Detach Neckstrap,This neckstrap has proven all it claims to be. Quickly adjustible. Attractive. Solid craftsmanship. Reasonably priced. I will definitely order this product again.
2,Nothing Special,"I generally like Vivian Crowley's work, but she missed the mark with this one. It wanders aimlessly filled with stock photos that have been overused for decades. Skip this one and buy one of her other books instead."
5,THE BEST YETTTTTTTTTT MUST GET,I have everyone of Shei Atkins CDs. Life is Stereo was great... Lita Mae Show was alright but this is amazing. She really put her heart into this cd. Every parent with young girls needs to get this cd and EVERYONE NEEDS TO GET THIS CD. She will be considered the Beyonce of Christian music. BEAUTIFUL WORK SHEI... IM PROUD.
4,Not bad,"Pretty good album. Some good beats / grooves on the first CD; second CD is not that great for me though, but I am still the type of person that prefers live music and real instruments to machines and technology."
1,"Ouch....bad,bad","This is one of the first and only bad experiences I have had with both an online seller (Organize-everything) and a product. These arrived cracked, and the ones that weren't destroyed lost air after a week of using them. They are made of a weak plastic that resembles something you would buy at a garage sale. Nice concept, but disappointing. I work hard for my money, I don't want to waste it, or my time, on this seller or product again. Organize-everything has a lot of growing up to in the way of business...maybe they can start by offering a decent price. Shop around folks."
5,still waiting,"I would have loved to make a very nice review about the items, but unfortunately, 1 month after the order, I'm still waiting for the deliverance."
3,Good formula not very enticing.,"Our nine year old Chinook, Samantha does not find this product to be very tasty so you may need to crumble it up and add a little canned food."
5,filter life aid,this product aids in the over all performance of our humidifier and adds to the filters life cycle.
3,It's OK,"I always used these in the humidifier, because they are recommended by the nmanufacturer and my humidifier has a special holder for it.However, they have a relatively short recommended life - 4 fillings and are relatively pricey, so for the cost/benefit I am rating it OK."
1,Not Impressed,"I have a Honeywell humidifier that is on my personal top 10 ""must have"" items. I figure with these cartridges the performance could only improve. I was wrong. There is NO improvement in the cleanliness of the tank or the filter area. The water actually smells funny with the cartridge in. Plus, I have noticed that the little beads inside fall out, and are reported to be harmful to pets and animals. They're so little it's hard to see them. Not a huge deal to me, but I'm sure it could pose a problem to someone.All in all, I would rather purchase purified water, or get a water filter for my sink for the water to use in the humidifier than use these, since there is no real difference."
3,"So, so.......","Here in El Paso the water has high mineral deposits. I filtered the water before I filled my humidifier, I use the demineralizing filters in my humidifier and the ProTec PC-1 in the tank and it still left a mineral residue. I noticed that before I washed the unit that the ProTec cartridge did reduce the slimy feeling of the water in the tank."
2,Don't know if this helps,"Not sure if this actually helps clean the humidifier tank because I'm still cleaning it out regularly. Also, one of the packages I received looked really old and sun damaged. Not impressed."
5,A good buy,"It really keeps your humidifier filters cleaner longer. I have used them for years and now that I found a cheaper source, rather than target--I get them here on AmazonEasy five stars"
4,I really noticed a difference!,"I followed the directions for this product exactly, and it worked great. I really noticed a difference with the humidifier. Before using this product, the humidifier was smelling a little funky. After using this, it has no smell at all. Overall I am very happy with this purchase!"
3,ProTec PC-1,"Product dlivered fast. Was recommended by the manufacturer of the appliance, I can't tell if it is working as it just sits in the water and ??does it's job?? I will continue to use this due to the recommendation by Honeywell."
4,Worth it,"While I don't know how it works, this product does seem to ensure that there are much less residues from the water in the humidifiers we use. Of course, I empty each unit every day, and clean as necessary."
4,Seems to work.,"I dropped one in each 1-gallon tank of Vicks humidifier about a month ago. The humidifier actually boils away the water every day to create steam. I found no traces of slime, mold, or bacteria. On the other hand, I must refill both tanks every day thus there isn't much time for or build up of anything. So I simply trust that they work. I think of it as insurance."
2,Make too much noise to sleep,"The cartridges were part of a package deal that I purchased from Allergy-Be-Gone. Its' hard to determine if they actually do anything, and they rattle around inside the water tank when water is moving from the tank to the heating element. So with every 'glug' the water generates, there is also rattling from the balls. I prefer skipping the balls, and cleaning the humidifier. Some humidifier tanks have a holder for these balls, which would eliminate the rattling."
3,its ok,THe product is as it is describe. Product does what is hould do. I would buy it again if I run out of the cartridge.
3,Good,This was pretty good for my humidifier. I would recommend this as it definelty kept the water and the tank clean and yuckie free!!!
2,it is an expensive unnecessary,"The cartridge costs about $5 and last only 20 days before the filter and the cartridge starting reek. However, I found that Holmes Bacteriastat costabout $7 and could last for a season and it also extended the life of the filter.My suggestion is to buy the Bacteriastat."
1,Smelled chemical-y,I had high hopes of less cleaning but the chemical smell this gave my water scared me. I don't want to breath fumes. Maybe it's safe but I didn't feel comfortable using it.
2,Waste of money,Its hard to prove this works at all. Save your money. My opinion this does not work and try something else.
1,Received damaged,"I received the 2 pack of cartridges damaged. The tiny beads inside the cartridge were loose rolling around in the package. I have emailed the company twice advising them of the damaged package and requesting a return. I have not received a response to date. II ordered this product online as they weren't sold at target or bed, bath. Luckily I found the cartridges at a walmart so no need to purchase them online."
2,Overpriced with minimal impact,"Item is too pricey for limited effect. With need to change filter every 4 weeks and now this ""cleaning"" cartridge, you can end up paying the price of the humidifier again before the winter is over!"
2,kind of pointless,"i bought this with a humidifier that i also ordered on amazon, because it suggested it to help keep the tank clean. i used it and havnt really noticed it doing anything. as long as you regularly change the water and periodicly clean your filter i dont see why you would need one of these. it was just kind of pointless."
4,I like it,I rated it a 4 star do to the fact it did allow some mold to start on the filter after only 25 days. But i used them last yearand they worked fine .So it may be a fluke. I'll see with the new one.
3,Not sure what it does,"I can't see much difference in the cleaning of my humidifier. The little wand pops easily into the tank. I tried it in two machines, but they still have some cooties in them."
3,Works for one humidifier but not the other.,"I honestly don't notice that much of a difference that it is making. It seems to work ok with my blue humidifier, but does nothing for the pink one we have."
3,Who Knows?,"I can't tell you really if this works or not. Although it is more of a pain, it seems that the humidifiers with the filters stay cleaner on their own, so probably better to stick with those."
4,"Good for 30 days, not 3","Just a note about the description: ""Keeps cleaning for 3 days"" should read ""30 days""! A cartridge lasts a month. Very simple to use -- just drop it into the humidifier -- and it stays clean."
3,$4 at Wallmart,Got one of these yesterday at Walmart for $4. Look in the Pharmacy area that is where I found them. Next to the Vaporizers.
2,Didn't Work for me...,"I am an analytical chemist and had high hopes for this product; however it didn't work for me. We have extremely dry weather and run at least three humidifiers throughout the house 24/7, along with a pot of simmering water on the stove which barely keeps the humidity at 50% during the winter (necessary for allergy and asthma issues). I have tried everything to help deal with keeping the humidifiers clean - and have not found anything that makes the upkeep easier (other than frequent descaling and filter changes). That said, if I wasn't operating at such extreme use (with hard water and sheer volume) these might work for some applications, just not mine."
1,Makes it worse,"I used to buy these for the humidifier in my room and the one in my daughters room. I had to clean the humidifiers every week because the filters would start growing mold and mildew on them. I just assumed this was normal because I used these right from the beginning. One month we were out and I forgot to order them. Guess what..... No black mold and mildew on the filter after a week. I quit using them and I can go 2 weeks without cleaning my humidifier. I don't really like to, but I can if I need to. Before I had no choice but to clean them every week because the filters got so bad."
1,Will invalidate warranty of SU-4010 humidifier,"The seller of this item (Ace Hardware Outlet in Brooklyn) misrepresented this device as saying that it would work in ALL humidifiers. They said that it was safe. The manufacture of the humidifier told me not to use it because it was not necessary, may damage the humidifier a would invalidate the warranty. When attempting to return this device to ACE HARDWARE they refused to pay for return shipping with would require me to pay $10 for UPS or $6.05 for USPS since they were requiring an insured and trackable shipping method. All of this for an item costing $11.99. I will NEVER deal with ACE again, and I hope that this serves as a warning to you. CAVEAT EMPTOR!"
1,Zero Stars,The list price for this item is $15.98. Why is Eleven Adar (as of 2008-11-25) charging $49.99? From most other online sellers (including Amazon.com when it is in stock) the standard price is $8.99.
1,What A RipOff!!!,On Amazon the Pro Tech filter cleaners cost about $6.00. The same product is $4.00 at Target. Get with it Amazon!
4,Humidifier tank cleaner tabs Have not used it yet.,"The packaging looks fine, the list of contents is what I expected.Have not used any of them yet, but I am sure that they will work as expected."
1,Difficulties,The item does not fit in any unit. I have two different ones and it does not fit in either. Its a small round ball with a tab sticking out. You need to submerge the whole thing in your water tank. The ball is slightly larger then a quarter and is only rated for 1 month.
1,Not worth the money,This product does not work. After 6 days my humidifier had so much mineral build-up that I had to chip it away with a very small screwdriver. It was a brand new hot air humidifier. Don't waste your money
2,"Used to work great, no longer effective","I've used these drop ins for years in the same humidifier tank. When I began using them years ago, the useful life of filter wicks increased dramatically. Ultimately, they would harden with minerals, but they never discolored. The Protec drop ins I've used this year have allowed discoloration to happen on filters immediately, in the first days and week of use.Will look for another company's product to use from now on, this one is just worthless now."
5,Cartridge is great,This is a great product it keeps the tanks clean on both of our humidifiers. The fact that it is a two pack is perfect for our use.
3,i don't know,"I bought this to go in my humdifier that promptly died after I had used a cartridge for a week. I don't know if that had anything to do with it or not and didn't get to use it long enough to tell if it would prevent buildup on the filter or not. I do know that when I got the sealed up package and opened it, there was only one cartridge not two as specified on the box."
4,Cleaning Cartridge,This little jewel works great. Keeps the mildew from setting up and keeps the water healthy for clean air coming from the humidifier.
1,Buy Elsewhere for under $5.,"These are good if you don't want to add 1/8 tsp. bleach every few fill-ups. However, who would buy this item when the exact same product is available from KAZ or Pro-Tech, and on Amazon for about FIVE DOLLARS for a twin-pack."
2,Use to love Protec but now it does not work,"I have used Protec cartridges for the past two years and I have ordered them from Amazon. The last three orders I have received have not worked. I e-mailed Kaz, the distributor, and they were of no help. They basically told me how to use the filter and did not address the quality issue. I am not sure what has changed but it does not work. I have moved on to the Holmes liquid product and it is wonderful."
4,Must have,Without this product in the tank you are guaranteed to have mold/mildew issues with your filters. Don't even think about running the humidifier without one or you will be changing filters often. You don't need to change cartridges as often as they recommend. All in all a good product.
2,"Did not pass the ""dissolve in water"" test.","I just bought this cal mag tablet. The pills are huge. I placed one table in tap water to check the time for it to dissolve. It started to break apart in about 15 to 30 minutes. The next morning most of the tablet was still sitting in the bottom of the glass, a lump about the size of a round M&M. The lump would not break apart even with a spoon. Does anyone know if I am safe in crushing the tablets and drinking them? I would be very grateful for any opinions. Thanks."
3,vegetable dog stew,"my dog does not like it and neither do i. it is not pleasant to look at and not pleasant for dog to eat,"
5,Do you want to know how deep the rabbit hole goes?,"[and some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth...] (The Fellowship of the Ring) -- and so I was reminded as I read every word (even the Endnotes) of this latest, quite excellent book by Paul Von Ward. The author used various resources (different sciences, religious and cultural accounts, translations of ancient texts and tablets, etc.) to research, examine and assess a more truthful account of the history of humans and society than what we've been led to believe. Von Ward's ecclectic, impressive background and his ability to ask questions others either fear to ask or never think to ask, only increase the compelling nature of the content. And the content, akin to the Red Pill of the Matrix, will indeed give readers an idea of how deep the rabbit hole goes."
3,Interesting,"Literate, well written. I could not agree with many of his ideas, but he did state them well. The subject he covers is controversial, to say the least, but that is part of its appeal. Needless to say, mainstream science will dismiss this book as being of no value whatever, but mainstream science suffers thereby. This book can be a good intro to these controversial ideas, especially if you are new to the subject."
5,"Like the pleasure of a perfectly-prepared, exotic meal","I know of very little music that I can listen to in a variety of contexts and still get pleasure out of it like the music of Badi Assad. Sit alone or with someone, turn the lights off, relax and be taken away by complexities of tone and rhythm that are nevertheless so easy to swallow. Or turn it on while you're thinking hard about some program or essay you're writing, letting it wash around you as you concentrate. And by all means, have it playing when you serve that exotic meal to your loved one, candles lit, the aroma of gently fried garlic in the air. Delicious!"
2,i just kept waiting for something to happen.,I was dissapointed. I liked a lot of her other books but this one seemed to drag on and i kept waiting for something to happen. Not one of my favorites.
2,can't finish this book,"I've enjoyed other books by Olivia Goldsmith, but as a mother of an adorable son who happens to be adopted, I can't get past the negative adoption language that is peppered throughout the story (at least the first part of the book) and the negative stereotypes of adoption that are reinforced here. I imagine the language (e.g. ""real mother"" when referring to her birth mother) and stereotypes (e.g. the character's mother prefers her biological daughter over her adopted daughter) would be offensive to any adoptive parent.It's a shame, because I chose to read this book because it's a fictional story that includes adoption as a part of it, but I just can't bring myself to finish it. For that reason, I can't recommend the book at all."
2,Is Olivia Goldsmith that shallow?,"First off, let me say that I didn't dislike reading this novel. However, I could not identify with any of the characters. Does anyone really care about clothes THAT much? The scorn that Oliva/Karen seemed to have for the common woman who can't afford the 900 dollar dresses was extremely evident. Could it be that she wants to be part of a world in which she will never be welcome?"
4,Cincinnati Police Motorcycle Officer Action Figure,"The figure is a lifelike representation of a motorcycle police officer who serves the City of Cincinnati. It is refreshing to see police displayed in the positive light portrayed by the action figure, which is seated on a fully-equipped Harley Davidson motorcycle. Good work, Hasbro!"
1,BRATZ BABIES???????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,OH COME ON LIKE A BRATZ BABIES OH CUTE DUH NOT.OH LOOK AT THAT BIG FAT CHUBBY HEAD AND THAT STUPID BLANKET.I HATE BRTATZ I LOVE MY SCENE'S BRATZ ARE CHEAP AND UGLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Caution: Bad Quality - Cheaply Made,This Bratz Big Baby was the only gift my daughter wanted for Christmas. She loved this doll. I saw her respond to this toy more than any other toy that she has ever gotten. Tonight she was playing with Sasha and carrying her around and she accidently dropped her on the floor and she broke. Her head broke right off of her neck. My daughter was heartbroken.This is a cheaply made toy. How cheap is a toy that can't stand to be dropped without it breaking. That should be the first quality control test done on toys.
3,Samsonite Ultra Mini Umbrella - more fashion than function,"I read about this umbrella in Real Simple magazine. It was rated as one of the preferred umbrellas for its lightweight nature and sturdiness given its size/weight. However, the first time i used it, a gust of wind inverted it within seconds. I must confess that while this wind-inversion is a common occurrence, the frame is resilient enough to be manually restored to its proper form....but only until another gust of wind comes along. It is cute, light, and is handy fora drizzle or a light rain -- not a thunderstorm."
3,Not what I thought -- but decent umbrella,"Based on the description I thought this umbrella would was auto open/close but it's not. Aside from that, it's very compact, light and has worked well so far."
3,Handy but not the best,"I bought this umbrella because i used to forget my umbrellas at work, this one i can keep in my pocket. It however cannot stand in strong winds. For heavy rain it may not work, best used when it is drizzling."
3,Not so strong umbrella,"I was looking for a lightweight umbrella that would be strong enough to withstand a typical windy day. I had had one that met these requirments for years, until an unusual accident had destroyed it. The reviews of this project made it sound like this might be similar. The umbrella is light enough, but one of the ribs broke the second time I used it - on a day with almost no wind. Another disappointment."
3,Oh so small,"So far I have not had a chance to really take this thing out in the rain to see how it performs, but I can give some notes about its build quality and size.First off, this thing is tiny, tiny, tiny. I wanted a compact umbrella, but Im also an average size male. This thing will likely keep me dry in the emergency storms, but I may consider a larger umbrella for day to day.Second, this umbrella is made from very thin gauge metal for the pole, it feels somewhat flimsy when extending and retracting. I wouldn't expect it to hold up to much wind. The handle is also very short and made of plastic.I would recommend this umbrella as an emergency ""keep in your car"" model, but for day to day use during the rainy season, you should probably look at something more sturdy and a bit larger."
4,Just right,"Its the right size for just one person, its portable and will protect u from the rain as long as it's not windy.The build is cheap and probably wont stand if there is wind but it does keep me dry from where Im from (MD, DC, VA)we dont get a lot of windy rains here"
2,Poor customer service and broke under average rain,"One of the metal part under the umbrella came off and when I called Samsonite they said we dont sell this item! I was shocked and refer them to Amazon site but no luck. I would not buy this item save your money, unless you want to be protected from light rain or sun."
4,good,"arrived on time, product is compact, lightweight, and fits in my purse w no issue. Some reviews mentioned that there is an auto feature to open up the umbrella but that is incorrect - it's a manual open only....."
3,Great melodic beats - pulsing drums,"If drum beats can be melodic - this album shows that.Two great gurus of the drums Sivamani - with his ecstatic beats, vedic chantics to add a mood to the music, crazy one-offs with the other great guru James Asher who with his own pulsing beats creates a superb album.And inspite of a whole album of drum beats - it doesnt bore you in the least. The mood changes totally across the album to revive and keep up the interest in listening intently and marvel at the fluidity of the pair.There are occasional melodic tunes too - with flutes and other instruments. But best of all is Sivamani's rapid fire chants and his vocal beats that he syncronises with the actual drums.If you want more of such ecstatic intrumentation and percussion in particular - should check out ""Blazing Drums"" which has some more masters in it like Trilok Gurtu, Kale Karsh etc."
5,Nice Equipment,"Have this installed in a Rack and has been working for 2 months nonstop. 16 connections hooked to it with a mixture of 100mb and 1GB, all working perfectly."
4,Same material,"Lester's books are very nice, but he has one set of houses which he recycles in each book -- right down to the detail pictures. If you already have one of his books you've already seen everything he has to offer in this one."
5,Charming but....,Since I have bought a number of books on small abodes this was one that appealed to me. However it isn't really a book that someone who is serious about getting design and simply living ideas may find of interest.We live in a small home (900 sq. ft 1800's cottage) by California standards and are designing an equally small newer home geared for us as we age.But it is charming and charming books belong in my life.
3,Creative living spaces,"I recently bought a very small house, approx. 600 sq ft including the cellar. I'm inspired by the tiny living spaces in which many people have lived throughout the century. This book definitely gave me some creative ideas on how to utilize the space that I have. Small houses are practicle, efficient, and economical."
1,Not recomended,"I do not recommend this book, I prefer the authors full sized book, ""A Little House of My Own: 47 Grand Designs for 47 Tiny Houses."" This book lacks the details present in the larger text and is less practical. The book is also quite small, as the title states."
5,Great little book!,"This book shows some great historical tiny houses, their floor plans, and in most cases the story of how/why they were built. This is not a book showing how to build or anything like that, but it is a great place for inspiration."
4,So Fine,Good movie if you're in the mood to laugh at silly stuff! Rather outrageous and unreal at times but acting was good throughout.
3,So Fine Video Tape,This is a classic off the wall comedy. If you don't laugh out loud at the gags you've missed the point. Jack Warner is at his best here. This one is a keeper. Only wish they had produced a DVD as it gets watched over and over.
1,too bad this did not play at all,"this DVD is apparently blank..did not play at all on any player, tried several different machines and nothing. very disappointing I have to say, waste of money."
5,Hidden Gem from the 80's,"So Fine is a classic comedy from the 80's. if you haven't seen it it's light hearted with some good gags at the right times.It fits in well with the likes of Police Academy and Stripes. I live in the UK and I have been trying to get this film for years on DVD, finally I found it on Amazon. It's a manufactured on demand title from Warner's Archive Collection.The picture is very good for an older title clear and crisp, and the DVD is Multi-Region."
3,So Fine is So So,"What can you say about a movie that show women's butts haha. The movie is corny and cheesy, but it was the 80's. I would say this is worth seeing, even if it's just to laugh at how corny it is. Ryan's character is kind of annoying to me, but I'm sure he was meant to be. I still think Ryan is cool though. I've been trying to find out if the jeans the girls wore really had cut outs or if they were pieces of flesh colored plastic glued or sewed to the jeans. My money is on the latter"
4,Pro Comp Shocks,"The shocks are fantastic, but, a person needs to know exactly which shock to buy. I ordered the ones to fit a jeep and they had the wrong ends on the shock. I kept them because they will fit another vehicle I own."
5,8 oz Omega-3 FA,"Arrived quickly. Was a different brand: ""Derma 3 Liquid"" by Vitality Systems instead of ""AllerG-3"" by Vet Solution. But it is still an omega-3 fatty acid supplement for dogs and that is what I wanted."
5,"Yes, it really does work!","I have a black standard Dachshund who had dry skin and really bad dandruff. My vet gave me a bottle of this stuff, and I have to admit I was skeptical at first - but within a couple of weeks the dandruff was gone and his coat was much better! Six months l inherited a shiba inu - and boy did she shed! So I started to give her the Aller G-3 too - and within a month, there was a noticeable change in her coat - it was much thicker and fuller. And, thankfully, she sheds a fraction of the amount she used to. I still have to comb her out regularly, but when I do there is far less hair - and between combings she leaves far less of it all over.Highly recommended!"
5,Ruckus,"Can not really review this product as I haven't used it long enough to notice any difference. This being said, all omega 3 products are good for both humans and animals. The price was very good and it came in a comvenient bottle with a pump."
4,"Pup likes it, too!",I give this to my dog every morning and he seems to do well while on it. Will continue to use.
5,Excellent product,"This product allowed me to take my cat off of her steroid medication. I never thought my cat would see relief from her skin condition, mainly caused my allergies. She was on a special diet, needed medication daily, blood tests every six months, this was all vey costly. This product eliminated the medication and blood tests, not only offering her scatching relief, but my pocket relief!"
2,time wasted,I bought these books at the reccomendation of a friend. I will still speak to her but will never follow her book advice again. I found both her books to lack imagination. I was bored and had to force myself to finish them. I have never stopped a book part way through but I wish I had with these.
1,I got the shaft on this!!,"Product discription states 30 each size for the Heli-Coil inserts, I got 30 total, only 6 for each length of insert. Now the company says it was not there mistake so I am stuck with a product that I got screwed paying $40.00 more than I could have bought it for in my own home town. This is what happens when you buy something on Amazon.com., no one is responsible for anything, and the buyer ends up taking it in the shorts. People beware what you purchase on Amazon.com., and remember if you get screwed thats just to bad for you."
3,Inexpensive but Lackluster Knob Control,"I purchased this tool for a home Ethernet install. It works well enough, and is similar to many other punch tools in its price range. The impact adjustment knob at the top doesn't lock in discreet intervals, so tends to slip with use."
5,Solid Product,I've used this punch at a lot of work places and haven't been disappointed. Solid product and functions perfectly. There is not much more to say about it.
4,"Good product, no problems","Difficult to write much about a punch down tool, it simply works and does its job as one would expect. Shipping etc were all fine."
4,Good tool,"+ I used this punch down tool in around 60 sockets (all 110 type) and it was very useful and I loved it.The only thing that I kind of don't like is the tension adjustor, if I leave it on mid it will go to low by itself if I don't pay extra attention not to touch it while I am using the tool. This only happen on mid, but if I set it to high or low it will stay there (maybe it was not meant to be left in the middle).I would recommend this tool to anyone who is setting up network either at home or professional.I did not use the Krone blade to comment on it, but the tool itself looks and feels sturdy and looks very durable."
4,Punch Down Ethernet tool.,"This is the perfect tool for the job! It does what one would expect when installing punch down connectors. I bought it for a small network in my son's house, and it worked without any problem. It is very professional, and it comes with an extra blade.I found the same tool somewhere else way more expensive than the price Amazon sell it. Besides being the right tool, the price is also wonderful. I'd recommend anybody in need for this to buy from Amazon."
4,An invaluable resource for planning your wedding!,"The Portable Wedding Consultant - Invaluable Advice from the Industry's Experts for Saving Your Time, Money and Sanity, by Leah Ingram. Just released in 1998 offering advice on everything from Bridesmaid Dresses (I let them choose their own), to Changing Your Name (still thinking about it), to the Honeymoon ('twas fabulous!) This book was a great resource, especially due to it's chapter on internet sites and resources, including: - the automatic wedding speechwriter - the site for Canada's Wedding Bells magazine - comprehensive wedding resource site in a magazine-style format."
4,D.O.A. or could it be...?,"While I don't own this charger (still considering), I felt compelled to state what I have read elsewhere: an individual thought that his Lenmar charger was D.O.A. also.Upon closer inspection, he noted thin plastic coverings over the ""touches"". Upon removing them, the charger worked!So, a heads up to prospective buyers."
1,worked ok at first... now unusable,"This product worked fine when I first bought it. Batteries charged in 1 hour, very convenient.HOWEVER, after a few months I started having problems. I would charge the batteries for 1 hour, until the indicator lights indicated that they were fully charged. But when I tried to use the batteries in my camera, they depleted after only a few minutes of use. The batteries also depleted quite rapidly when not in use, they were dead after about one day unused.I do not know whether the problem is with the batteries or with the charger, but this product is now unusable."
1,Dead on Arrival -- Do Not Buy,Should have listened to the reviewer before me. Unit arrived dead. Neither AC power or car charger worked. Tried replacing the 4 batteries that came with it with my other known batteries and unit still did not work.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!,"These are pure garbage! Ordered one and it arrived DOA. No power reached the charging unit either through the transformer or the car lighter adapter. Sent it back as a lemon, and ordered a replacement once again based on the previous review.Guess what? The replacement also arrived DOA for exactly the same reasons as the first. If you like buying items from Amazon and then returning them to Amazon, this is the item for you. If not, try another charger!"
2,Needed more,This DVD was like a brief overview of Black History in New York. I was disappointed; it should have been longer and more comprehensive.
4,kid again,(...) i still enjoy barbie when i bought this toy the thing i liked most was that it was fun and enjoyable it was like your in the mind of ryan or nicki it made me feel 4 years old! i think this toy would be good for any girl my age who wants to feel like a little kid!!!!!
5,this band ROCKS!,"THIS BAND REALLY ROCKS,AND THE SINGER IS PRETTY EASY ON THE EYES ALSO.THEY ARE A CROSS BETWEEN METALICA,SUM 41, AND HINDER."
5,Chesky's highlight,"Bruce's opinion and approval are obscure at least. I've listen HOBO from net at first time, and purchase CD, it sounds much better. Cheskys 96Khz/24bit recordings are true audiophylle. Pro fully music delights, it's required quality equipments and there are no mistakes. Great old songs like ""Brickhouse"" and ""Oh Well"" are amazing. Accoustic guitar, harmonica, retiring bass and percussions offers a straight live sensations. If you have an affection for naturaly sound, sans mixing, dubbing, electronics etc, your ears will be captured for a best award.P.S. I'm a owner of ALL Saras recordings, and that's most pleasurablly in my collection certainly."
2,Still running with a Walkman,"The last time his book was revised was in 1996, and it really needs an update for the 21st century. Nutritional insights have changed, shoe and outerwear technology is evolving, and thirteen years is a long time. Training programs can be very different today, and there's no mention here of GPS running, MP3 players and the Nike plus system, or runners websites. Instead, there is a discussion on running with a Walkman.An illustrated set of streching excercises really should be added, and the wellness and psychological content should be critically evaluated.That's not to say this is a bad book, it's motivational and written in a pleasant, informal tone. But if this is the only running book you buy, you'll miss a lot."
4,Wonderful motivator,"I will not bother going on and on about the book, since there is already such an overwhelmingly positive collection of reviews.Suffice it to say, this book really kick-started by love of running, and was filled with everything the beginner needs to know.While it could use illustrations for good stretches, for example, it is still the classic keystone in any runners library, and strongly recommended!"
3,Too much information,"This book contains waaaaaay too much information. If all you want to do is get the basic preparation and a startup running regimen, you might die of old age wading through endless verbiage before getting to those salient points. God knows it's hard enough to get people motivated to run, so lets not let those magic moments of enthusiasm cool off while we elaborate every conceivable detail of the fairly elementary process of putting one foot in front of the other."
5,Works great!,"Just listening to this CD will teach you a lot about stereophonic sound. Play it through your system, then take it to a stereo dealer to see what you are missing, if anything. Use the tonal progressions to see what needs to change in your own system. This disc is wonderful, and a real help to anyone who takes hi-fi seriously. I highly recommend it, with one caveat: You may find out your system is not as good as you think it is!"
1,Item not quite as pictured,"The picture of the filters shows some foam stripping on the sides which is important to forming a seal in the Coleman filter box. Unfortunately, the filters I received did not have the foam stripping. The dimensions appear correct, but I am going to have to go purchase some of my own foam strips and retrofit the filter to ensure it seals in the air box. Very annoying, especially since it claims to be a replacement specifically for Coleman. I'll go back to my other brand of filters next time."
4,Worth the buy !,"it is good. buy the lenmar omnisource charger from amazon as well. Both combined is 75$ cheaper than the $100 just for sony battery. omni charger is great !!!!!!!!!!! The omni charger can be used to charge any brand battery. it has diff plates to fit different brands.Don;t mix this abttery with the sony charger, don;t know what can happen."
1,Pure garbage,Streaks on printout when I first installed it.Put my old cartridge back in a everything OK.Put the Rhinotek back in a put up with thestreaks on and off then after about a monthbig blobs and faded imgages.
4,Very Nice Read,I really enjoyed this book.I wish there was more lesbian romance novels out there for Kindle.
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this book. After I read her fist book entitled "" I Found My Heart In San Francisco"" I expected the same quality of writing. This book could have ended 200 pages from the orginal ending. She seems to be forcing the story and adding to things just to add more pages."
4,Puerto Rico's all-time most beloved Salsa institution.,"Although this CD was released at a time (1994) when Salsa bands of yesteryear were getting less and less radio airplay El Gran Combo managed to maintain a strong presence thanks to such big hits like ""Con Los Brazos Abiertos"" and ""Lo Sabia"". What is perhaps most remarkable about this CD is that even the straight-ahead Salsa Romantica tracks have a freshness, vitality and swing that makes them enjoyable. This is a band that has managed to remain at the forefront of the Salsa scene in Puerto Rico and this CD (and its well-deserved success) let the world know that El Gran Combo is here to stay."
5,everyone in management should have this book!!,"treat your workers with respect, show them that you do care how they feel, listen to what they have to say,..treat them the way you would want to be treated,....and be real!!! this book hopefully will knock some sence into some of these managers that dont know how to treat other people!! treat your workers with care and respect,..and you will have the best employees you could ever ask for!! what more can i say?,....buy the book."
4,Good cups for baby,"I just got these cups for my 8-month old, and they work well for him. I was a little disappointed that these cups have a hard spout and a plug-in valve. I found some cups that look just like these but have a soft spout that is spill-proof without a plug-in valve (when the baby sucks on the spout, it causes slits in the plastic to open). I LOVE the other cups, but these are ok too. They're a pretty good deal for the price (if you don't have to pay shipping)."
3,Worth every penny,"It's a cheap case; worth every penny I paid for it. It doesn't fit quite right and slides around on the phone so I have to adjust it to plug in the charger. Sometimes it's easier to just take the case off to take a picture than to fight with moving the case around. Very worth the price, and yeah it's a cover for a phone that isn't made any longer, so why do we need to review it??"
3,A Little Too Small to be Functional,Size matters. More than a day's worth of mail and this is full. A shame because very happy with looks. Having the door and a gasket in the mid-section is questionable - time will tell if it stays dry and closed.
3,small & possibly hazardous,"We recently purchased our Loon mailbox and installed it right away. It is as cute as can be !!! Very unique!!Yesterday...about 3 weeks after installing it, we received a note from the postmaster saying it wasn't approved by the USPS.The postmaster said our mail carrier had trouble with the door (mailman broke it as it stuck..and we had to do a makeshift repair) and the mailman put his hand in and got scratched...the inner rim is kind of sharp.It is much smaller than a standard rural mailbox on the inside although the loon is probably life sized.Anyway..postmaster told us we had to change it ASAP.My husband is currently trying to prove to postmaster that is is an approved mailbox and that we will try to make it less hazardous.However..if you get a lot of mail or many magazines....sorry too small."
2,"So, so quality",I guess I couldn't expect much here. This is an older movie that was never made into DVD state. I thought it would be better than the quality I had but it isn't. The price was cheap so I got what I paid for. Maybe it will come out sometime on DVD and I could get something better.
2,"Tedious, sleepy balladry","This CD is mostly filled with extremely slow, cheesy ballads which become quite boring. Besides, I think Ms Caram isn't a really good singer: although her voice is nice, she has a very narrow range and seems to be singing always the same notes, and that makes her sound very monotone. However, the two uptempo tracks are quite nice, especially ""Africando"", a very good samba: here she is rhythmically much more at ease and she sounds ultimately much more convincing than in the slow songs. ""Maracan"", the other uptempo track, is also quite delighful, with a tasty final scat. But the shame is that 90% of the CD is slow. In summary, if you're an Ana Caram fan you may like this release, but if you don't know her and you're searching for good soft Brazilian balladry and bossa nova, I would recommend you to choose some other singers as Joo Gilberto, Astrud Gilberto, Nara Leo or Rossa Passos, for instance, which are much more compelling."
2,Vague,"Here's the straight dope on this, despite all the raving. Although this claims to be a breakthrough technique that constitutes more than just meditation, it really is nothing more than an attempted resynthesis of the age old vipassna meditation. This synthesis is hopelessly vague, poorly articulated, and overly verbose without being adequqtely descriptive. I gave it two weeks and found it unexecutable.Even mystical Buddhism is more logical by comparison. If you're the touchy feely type who is satisfied with no more than simple suggestion, then it might be woth the seven bucks, threfore, 2 stars."
5,Easy to read and understand,"As a layperson, I was skeptical as to whether I would be able to understand this book. I was expecting lots of clinical explanations. To my surprise, it was just the opposite. Written so that anyone can understand it, ""Focusing"" gives the guidance to holistically find the source of fears, anxiety, and negativity. It guides the reader to a place where he/she can sit and listen to the body speak of the source of a problem's manifestation. I recommend this to anyone seeking a deeper understanding of why we sometimes feel the way we do."
3,Highly Theorectical,"Comprehensive coverage of SEM, highly technical and heavy with references. Better for advanced students of SEM rather than novices."
4,Real Food for Bachelors,This book is fun and practical for ANYONE who is culinarily challenged. Many of the recipes are good enough to serve guests - and I don't mean JUST your buddies schlepping beer on the couch.
1,WAY too gimmicky,"This book's recipes all focus WAY too much on the gimmick of using canned foods. A much better focus for a book aimed at the reluctant cook would be to pare down classic ""guy"" recipes to their simplest form, not figure out a bunch of things you can mix with Spaghetti-O's! Ugh. Most of the recipes are unappetizing at best. Maybe this would be a good gag gift. Maybe."
3,"A So-So Book, But Not Bad At All","This book would be perfect for a college student on a tight budget who will, generally, eat anything. I give it three stars for the attention to budget, the simplicity of the presentation, and the pictures that show the guy or girl not used to the kitchen what things ""look"" like. It's really very, very user-friendly. It's also solidly constructed and laminated, so it's kitchen-accident friendly as well.The problem is that many of the recipies look - well - really gross. And I am sorry, but even the most ravenous would probably think twice about anything made with Spaghetti-Os that bears more than a passing resemblance to a botched autopsy.Great for the college student or the single person ""on the go"" who is not nit-picky about their food. Otherwise, pass.No firm recommendation one way or the other."
5,Cute and Humorous,Bought this for my son who cannot cook - he laughed but he has also used this and has become a little more comfortable in the kitchen
3,"A Man, a Can, a Plan: 50 Great GUY meals Even You Can Make","the recipient of the gift loved the book...I thought it was going to be spiral-bound...although the pages are coated, the binding won't provide longevity if used a lot"
3,Good for Novices-- better than starving to death,"I bought this for a guy who seriously knows absolutely nothing about cooking. Absolutely nothing. This book is good for people at his level of (not) understanding because it presents accessible, everyday, ingredients in an easy-to-use format. One recipe even uses the football game to measure how long the dish should stay in the oven. It also presents some excellent health facts. However, kitsch factor aside, some of the recipes don't look all that tasty. As previously mentioned, some things like chilli/beer/biscuit dish just look unappetizing. Plus, the titles of some of the recipes strike me as offensive and unnecessary: ""Border Patrol Casserole,"" ""Homeboy Homefries"" and ""Mexi Can Pie"" made me embarrassed to give this book as a gift. Just becaues a recipe has beans in it, doesn't mean it has ties to mexican food, or its people. But the book is good on the basics and will make the kitchen less intimidating for some people."
1,Downright insulting to men the world over...,"First of all, I have been known to cook quite a bit before, so this book probably shouldn't have been on my list of things to buy to begin with. I thought I'd save loads of time using this book to start cooking for myself once again, boy was I wrong. Since when did Spaghetti-O's become fine dining? I didn't even care for Spaghetti-O's when I was a kid, so the thought of using them in a recipe now is just disgusting. Most of the other recipes in the book are either horribly gross or common sense. I really don't understand why there needs to be a recipe for hot dogs and chili when they're just using regular hot dogs from the refrigerator section of the grocery store and canned chili... it's not rocket science. I suggest you take the advice of the author and ""dump"" the book in the nearest trashcan as soon as possible."
3,Purchased as an Xmas Present,"I purchased this as an Xmas present for my nephew - who asked for it. I can not tell you anything except it arrived as it said it would, within the shipping time I paid for."
1,Um. . . . Never got it,I ordered this product on 12/12/11 and I've never got it. I dont feel like I can say anything about the product since I've never seen it or heck recived it!!!
2,Bad Recipes,This is a book for college students. The recipes are simple to say the least. A bunch of processed foods mixed together makes a meal. What is really horrible is that this book acts as an ad for brand names of canned goods.
4,Great for a young single guy,"I bought this for my brother who is 28 years old and lives by himself. The recipes looked pretty easy but not so healthy. Some of the dishes sounded gross but many of the ingredients can be substituted to make it more like ""real food"". Overall, it was a good gift though!"
4,"A great idea, though with slightly flawed execution","Pros: The format of the book is great (complete with the big splatter-resistant pages), was obviously written by a ""true guy"", the recipes are easy and quick, and has a sense of humor.Cons: The ""+"" format is deceptive as there's often very significant ingredients that don't show up in the ingredient pictures; you also have to read into the recipe just to find out what tools are needed. Given how much sodium is a problem (especially for men) the use of such heavily salted ingredients is odd for Men's Health to use. Most of the recipes are for 4 to 10 servings: Granted most guys eat 2 ""servings"", but it doesn't make it very easy to substitute for the ""Burger-Rama mega-deal""."
2,not for everyone,"Bought this for my college-bound brother and upon receiving it was surprised that very few sounded appetizing. Very economical meals, but not very tasty. Your college student will NOT be picking up any girls with these recipes! I purchased the cookbook ""A Man, a Can & Grill"" from the same series afterward. These are recipes I would eat! Great gift to accompany a George Foreman grill, for example. Perfect for introducing the new cook to ways to marinate/season different types of meat. That said, keep in mind that this requires ingredients that can spoil (i.e., the meat)."
1,Not what it seems to be:,"About the only thing this book was good for was a good laugh when my wife saw it. It could be a good gag gift for a man that can't cook, just don't expect him to use it. Almost all the meals required a oven or stove top, only a few were ""nuked"" - plus I don't want to wait a half hour for something to be simmered or baked. ALSO: in small type at the bottom of the page was the ""Also:"" area that included stuff that was not in a can, i.e. 10 oz can of refigerated pizza dough, 1/2 8 oz can tomato sauce, 1 cup shredded cheese - why bother, just order a pizza or pop in a frozen one. Save your money on this, there have to be better cook books out there for beginners."
2,"It's more advertising, than real cooking","Many of the recipes in this book don't look good at all. Spaghettio's mixed with ground beef and peas? Gross, might as well make Hamburger Helper!Also, most of the recipes would be just as easy to make with fresh ingredients, that would taste so much better. But, it is good advertising for the companies that sell the canned goods..."
5,LYNN V ANDREWS,Lynn V Andrews books are a good read. They are interesting and well-written. I recommend all of them - let your mind fly ... great read
1,New Age heritage of Carlos Castaneda,"Books by this author appeal to the New Age market, having no solid basis in ethnography, nor any scholarly value whatsoever. The author produces books like one relieves bodily necessities; to make a buck, the author seeks to 'corner the market' on New Age 'spirituality' . Quality not quantity"
5,Great!,"While it is not possible to choose the color that you get, we got a winner! The pink and purple step stool is wonderful for out little girl and it is very sturdy. It states that it can hold up to 800 lbs so there is no need to be concerned about it collapsing on your little one and we have never had an issue with it tipping over. Highly recommended!"
4,Wonderful design - but no opportunity to pick color!,"This stool is perfect design and price for my little man. He specificly uses it for in front of the toilet and it gives him perfect height to keep accidents to a minimum. The only problem - all the colors shown in the picture were primary colors - any of which I would have been fine with - but the one that came... was pink and purple. My husband said to ship it back, but for a $10 stool, I would have paid more for shipping than it was worth... so WORD TO THE WISE... BE PREPARED YOU MAY NOT GET ONE OF THE COLOR COMBINATIONS PICTURED."
4,Nuby step stool,"8"" high. Super sturdy. Not skid feet and top. Really just bomb proof. Much better made than Ikea other similar stools. Perfect."
5,Very sturdy stool!,"This stool exceeded my expectations. It is extremely sturdy, not the slightest bit tippy, and has non-slip feet as well as a non-slip top. I bought it for my 20 month old daughter so she could stand at the bathroom sink and wash her own hands. Works perfectly for that. I thought that it was a typo in the product description that it will hold up to 800 lbs, but the paperwork on the stool also states the same. My husband is a big man and the stool did not even ""flinch"" when he stood on it. Well worth the money and not being able to pick colors is no big deal."
4,Good build quality,"This is a 4.5 star product in my opinion.I do not use it for ""professional use"". I make cables as needed at home. I make a few a month.Build quality is very good. It feels nice in my hand. When crimping it feels like I can get a lot of leverage and the end on my completed ethernet cable is nice and tight. Does what is should do.However, I have used three different RJ45 ends and each one does not click into place when installing into the jack after crimping. Perhaps, this crimping tool is deforming that little plastic tab during crimping. Not sure. I would take off 1/2 star if I could. I am not sure if it is the ends that I use or the crimping tool. I would not let this stop me from purchasing this product.After crimping, I pry the tab back up and it works fine. My connections then click into place as they should."
5,"Stripper part of tool not straightforward, but it crimps great","I'm a newbie to making Cat5 patchcords, and found this tool to be great. It worked perfectly with the Tripp-Lite connectors (make sure you buy the right connector (stranded/solid) to match your cable!!The only difficulty I had was getting the stripper to work on round cable. It's extremely sharp, and slices right through the insulator and internal wires with only a little pressure. I had to slightly close the cutter and twist the cable to make a slice around the circumfrence. The insulator came right off after that."
4,"Low cost, and easy","Lowes had a similar product on their shelves for around $70 that included some telephone and ethernet jacks. What a steal compared to that price, and it worked like a charm for my rj-11 crimping job."
3,Okay...,"This product gets the job done, However it's Sheath Stripper has no adjustment and does not fit any of the brands of Cat5e I have unless I use my thumb to hold it against the blade. Good product for the price."
3,"Trendnet crimp,cut,strip tool","This is a well made, substantial tool with one flaw. Don'tuse it to strip exterior from Cat5 cable as the cutting inserts will cut thru any wire close to the twist inside the insulation and there is no adjustment possible on position of the cutters."
3,Its okay...,"Does the job, I would never buy this type of connector again. I would buy the connectors and crimper that the wire goes all the way through the connector. Blade seems to not be quite the right height for my cat 5 cable."
4,it works fine,It is not a professional level tool. But it should be just fine for normal household need for fixing a cable or two. Be sure the firm squeeze for the final crimp.
4,Worth every penny,These crimpers are worth the minimal cost. I had a cheaper pair of crimpers that was not getting a good connection on the wires but this one has not had a mis-crimp yet.
4,Great crimping tool for a great price,"Works very well, comfortable in my hands, and the fact the cutter and stripper are built in are wonderful. My only gripe about the product is when you cut the wire, there is an ""auto"" wire stripper that tends to cut the internal wires on my cat5 cable, so I just need to cut the wire, then seperately strip the wire. Not a big deal at all, I'm just nit-picking."
5,works well,"It works for me. This is the first time I was working with cable termination. Bought this tool because of good price and reviews. Didn't make a single bad cable so far with it, and using it was very easy.However, i found that following instructions on stripping cables may damage the inside ones, because blades may come a little too close. But, the top blade is a little longer, and at the end of it there's another round spot for a cable. place it there and spin it, and the corner of the blade will strip it clean.Other thing, the bar between handles seems like it is supposed to keep the tool in ""closed"" state, which it does only once in a while."
4,Just what I was after,"I don't do a lot of cabling but after losing my old crimper I was looking for value. The crimper seems to be good and sturdy and works well enough. It has a Cat 5-type stripper and a flat cable stripper too. I still haven't figured out how to keep the thing closed in my toolbox--there's a ""release"" knob on the ratchet bar between the two handles but I think that's just operator error on my part. If you are the average computer geek I think this crimper will fill the bill. Decent price and it works."
4,Hasn't failed me yet.,"It works well as a crimper. I've never had a connector fail yet. As a jacket stripper it could work in a pinch, but you have to push the cable into the blade because the groove is too big and it tends to nick the conductors. Not a big deal as I bought a separate stripper. Don't expect to get by without buying a separate stripper yourself unless you only plan on doing a couple connections."
4,"Great Crimper, Stripper Not Great","A nice sturdy crimper that is comfortable to use. Made 8 RJ45 connections so far and all 8 worked the first time. The cable stripper that is attached to the crimper also strips off insulation from the internal wires, so I just used a knife instead, using the cutting blade to get all 8 wires straight prior to placing in the jack. Maybe the stripper is adjustable by moving the blades slightly, but I didn't get that far before I finished the job. I would buy it again, good value for the price."
4,Right tool for the job!,"I had to run a few runs of cable under my house, this tool fit the bill and got the task accomplished - great tool for home use. I can't speak much on long term durability but no major problems during it's first tour of duty. I'm sure there are better tools out there but this ones well worth the investment."
2,Needs Adjustment,"I like Trendnet. I really do, but this offering from them simply doesn't make the grade. It crushes the locking tabs on RJ-45 connectors so badly that they become unusable (won't lock into the jack) and you have to do it over until you get just the right touch. If there were a way to adjust it, I would give a better rating but since you cant, I can't recommend this tool even for occasional use."
5,nice,"This arrived today and I've made two cables. Both turned out great. I won't be using this super often so the ROI is fantastic. Cuts and strips cat5 nicely.You'd be able to use EZRJ45 connectors with this crimper, except you'd have to cut off the wire's after you crimp it.This thing is about the price of 2 cross-over cables at retail value."
4,Strippers don't work. But overall good product.,Very nice product for the price. Strippers don't work that well. But crimps and cuts like it's supposed to. Good buy. Would have been nice not to have to use another tool to strip. Luckily I had one already and was just buying this as a replacement for stolen pair.
3,Great price for crimper but get a better cutter/stripper,"For the price, you can't go wrong. The crimper/cutter works great. The stripper blade on this kept cutting into the wires so I had to use a separate stripper in order to make the cables."
4,Sturdy tool,"Pros:1. No issues crimping dozens of 8P8C connectors.2. Sharp cutter.Cons:1. Due to the ratchet between the handles, you can't slide the tool over wire to cut it, meaning that making a cut in the middle of a long wire forces you to feed the whole wire through the cutter hole.2. The stripper is designed for flat wire. There's a slot for circular wire, but the cutting blade doesn't pierce the sheath on the cat5 cable I'm using, so I have to force the cable against the blade while rotating the tool to strip the wire."
4,completely satisfied,"I don't do a lot of terminating, just for home network purposes.The tools did everything well.It conveniently cuts outer isolation on the cable,other edges cut the cable itself very straight and easy.Termination step was done good as well.I never did this myself before, only watched couple times.It happened to be clear and convenient with this tool.The only flaw I could think of is what other people mentioned as well thatit closes only somewhere halfway. But it's not important to me since I use itvery occasionally and I keep it in the original packaging.Bottom line: I'm totally satisfied with the quality and the performance.And the price even with S&H; was lower than I could find in any retail store."
5,RJ45 crimper does a great job of light crimping,"I bought this crimper to use in replacing the RJ45 plugs on ethernet cables that lose their plastic retaining clip. When the cable slips out of its housing, it drives me nuts. I've used the crimper to fix one 14 foot cable, and based on the cost of a new 14 foot cable, the crimper has already paid for itself."
2,cutter for cable doesn't work,cutter doesn't cut outer sleeve on a CAT 5 cable. Also crimping is hit and miss for CAT 5.
2,Doesn't crimp reliably. Waste of time/money.,I have tried to use this crimper to make my own CAT-5 cables a few times and I have never had success. It seems to push the contact areas on the connectors (where the network card makes contact with the connector) down too far so that the network card's contacts can't reach the contacts on the connector. I have tried not squeezing too hard and it seems to still have the same problem. The other functions like stripping the sleeve off the CAT-5 cable seem to work fine but it doesn't perform it's main function very well.
2,Not Reliable,The cutter is not convenient since it will cut through the cable. The crimp is also not always reliable or else the connectors I purchased from the same company don't work (3 of 4 did not work)
2,Crimping degrades over time,The crimping degraded after about 6 months of use and since the die is not replaceable I have to get a whole new tool. The pins no longer crimp all the way so a couple plugs would be no good. Thinking about trying out the Platinum Tools crimpers next.
5,Both an introduction and a deep feminist and political analysis!,"Marilyn Frye's introduction to feminism and her clear discussions of the principle vital subjects relevant to our society is timeless - and priceless!This short intense book contains articles and previous lectures presenting analyses of the relationships between women and men, blacks and whites, gay men and women.The chapter on women's anger and how it is responded to in society, the chapter ""On being White"", the chapter on women in general called ""In and out of Harm's Way: Arrogance and Love"", and the brilliant discussion of lesbian identity, ""To Be and Be Seen:the Politics of Reality"" - all are classics, creating a foundation for understanding the structure of society.Thank you Amazon for continuing to sell it and for your speedy delivery, even overseas!!!"
5,"Its a part to fit your car, and it fits.",What else can I say about it. Oh...this one at least is Made in the USA. 20 word limit? Okay it's black and it keeps tranmission fluid from leaking.
5,Very good.,"Excellent CD, very well written, with beautiful songs and good dynamic sound.I recommend for anyone who loves a good jazz"
2,Rebuttal,"The reviewer below criticizes me for not giving scripture to support my own view. Well, Fenley had a whole book in which to quote scripture. It's not possible to support my view in the space of a small review, so I suggest the book END-TIME PROPHECIES OF THE BIBLE, also available here at Amazon, if you want a book that quotes the same passages Fenley quotes but ALSO quotes the many passages he completely ignores--passages that describe events for Christ's return that clearly never happened around A.D. 70. and need to be dealt with honestly."
5,si senor.....,"by no doubt, this was one of their best albums that they ever made!!! some good ""swings"" throughout their songs..."
5,Great cd!!!,"Accustomed to listening to this legendary percussionist with force musical ever and low musical carpet excellent arrangements of the great Marty Sheller, this cd contains one more once the power of latin jazz. Two guests give us their beautiful solos in the flute - teacher and student, the two grandmasters (Hubert Laws and Dave Valentin), giving us such fine scales and excellent rhythms. A special disk."
5,LOVE this monitor and the peace of mind that comes with it,"This isn't just an ordinary monitor. It actually monitors our baby's every movement, including his breathing. Both components can either be plugged into the wall or run off of batteries so we take it everywhere with us.We did have a few false alarms until we bought the masonite board. The monitor manual instructs using the board if the sensor pad (which detects baby's movement) is sitting on springs under the mattress (ours was).It was worth every penny. I actually bought it on another site (for less) called all4moms.com"
5,I love this item.,When I heard about the Angelcare Monitor I immediately knew it was what I was looking for. My daughter only likes to sleep on her tummy and hates to be swaddled. This product works amazing. My husband and I set it up and used a board under the bassinet mattress as others suggested and it worked great. We tested it dozens of times and it never failed.We have had NO false alarms and thankfully no real ones either.This is a must have for every parent/grandparent/caregiver of a tummy sleeper. You should always check on your little one but this serves as a great added sense of security.Hospitals and pediatricians should recommend this product. There is little information about them out there and it really could be a life saver. Of everything we have purchased or received this is my most valued item for baby.
5,Safety Net for premature babies...,"My great nephew was born 3 months premature and this baby monitorhwlped keep our Donovan alive, he is now 26 months old and thriving!"
5,Better sleep for mom and dad!,"When I saw this monitor, I decided it was a must! Our son slept in his room from his 1st day home and this monitor gave me the piece of mind so that my husband and I could get some sleep as well! My husband was particularly sceptical as to the accuracy but has become a huge supporter of AngelCare! It's amazing just how sensitive the sensor pad really is - only a small part of the baby's body actually has to be on the pad for it to detect movement. Only when he started to crawl around in the crib did the alarm ever go off! Now that he is 1 1/2 yrs. old, the movement part is disconnected. We have never had any external interference w/ this monitor (ie. cordless phones, etc.). Great product and well worth the money -We love it!!!"
2,Invest in different monitor,I hate this monitor. I don't know if it's the area we live in or what.....but when it is plugged in I get HORIFFIC feedback - I hear phone converstations......radios....and what ever. I would throw this out the window if I could. The only time it works half way decent is if it runs on batteries.....but the batteries have to be replaced every 2-3 days. Don't waste your money - this product isn't all what it is supposed to be.
2,Horrible Monitor...Would Not Recommend,"This is a horrible monitor and a waste of money. I've never even used the sensor pad because, like others mentioned, you have to put a piece of plywood or something under the mattress to keep it steady. Not convenient if you don't have a piece of plywood laying around. Another frustrating thing with this monitor is that if you don't put it on the right setting, it clicks, so I've never even used any other setting than the noise setting. The biggest frustration of all for us has been the horrible static and buzzing that comes through on the receiver! We have to put our electric fan on at night so we can sleep and not hear the monitor buzzing. It seems every other night we're jiggling and playing with it to get the transmitter in the exact spot where it doesn't have static."
2,Sleep with piece of mind untill the false alarms come!,I think this monitor has the right idea but unless your child sleeps in the middle of the crib directly on top of the monitor pad you will get false alarms. My twin boys are 7 months old and the only reason they ever wake up in the middle of the night is because the alarm on the monitor is going off. I had to set the sensitivity on the monitor all the way up and just like before we still get woken up in the middle of the night because one of my sons had moved to the foot of the crib.
1,Waste of Money,We hated this product and had to stop using the pad after a number of false alarms. Our daughter is a very active sleeper and would scoot all over the crib during the night. Even after putting a board under the matress the alarm would go off every time she was not directly under the pad. We'd go running into her room every time the alarm went off only to find her sleeping peacefully. We still use the monitor but we would have been better off buying something less expensive.
3,Piece of mind but what a buzz!!...,"We have friends who lost their 4 week old due to SID's so registered for this monitor for piece of mind. I use the movement detector and it works very well. If I forget to turn the monitor off before picking up my little one in the morning or after a nap, I am quickly reminded as the loud alarm sounds. My problem is that their is a LOUD buzz/hum on the reciever no matter what volume you set it on. It's so loud that it is hard to get to sleep. We've tried both A and B settings to no avail. Also, it doesn't work 40 feet away at the pool in the backyard. Maybe our walls of outrageously thick but for these two reasons, I can only give 3 stars. I am now lookng for a long range QUIET monitor to replace this one since my little one has gotten bigger and SID's is no longer a fear."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this monitor after reading all of these wonderful reviews on Amazon only to find myself extremely disappointed. Aside from the several false alarms (I can live with that because at least I know it's working),this monitor has proven to be very non-functional. My first baby was born in May, and within the 3 months I've been using this, there have been several times where the receiver goes dead(in the middle of the night-it was working when I went to bed) and I hear my baby screaming from his room and not on the monitor. I even went to the website and tried troubleshooting to no avail. Also, the interferance is awful with just 2 channels although interferance can happen with any monitor. Needless to say, I just ordered another monitor and will probably throw this one out because I wouldn't even give it to my worst enemy. I hope that mine was just a lemon and that no one else wastes almost $... like I did. I definately have no peace of mind with this monitor."
5,This is the Greatest Product ever!!!!,"This product is exactly what all the reviews say!!! It really does work !!! Finally a product that does work. We just pluged it in and that was it!!! One of the reviews said it took a long time to set up, thats not true!!! They might have turned the sensitivity dial by mistake. Just leave it at the factory setting and you wont have a problem. The only problem we and many other uses have (and its really not a problem) when you take the baby out of the crib or bassinett you have to remember to shut it off or it will sense no movement in the crib and sound the alarm. To us, it shows that this thing is really working!!!! YOU MUST BUY THIS!!! TRUST US, YOU WONT BE SORRY!!!!"
3,Works ok but build quality is questionable,"We got this unit primarily cause of the motion sensor. The motion sensor works as advertised for us but I can see why some people have issues with it.What I like:- it has a motion sensorWhat I don't like- consistent interference problems - the monitor does not have a ""activate only on sound"" option so it's always transmitting and the receiver is always receiving - this is rather annoying at any volume above ""quiet"" since you'll always hear some sort of hum from it- shoddy build quality - the switches and the plastic feel kinda cheap and any drop higher than 2-3 feet will most likely destroy the device. We had a transmitter fail after a 3 foot drop - it still transmitted audio but sensor no longer worked - had to replace it"
5,FINALLY I CAN SLEEP AND NOT WORRY!,I was hestitant about buying this monitor. It's pricey and does it really work? This is my 2nd child and for some reason was very afraid of SIDS. I purchased it along with the wood board that goes under the monitor to make sure it's flat. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I feel safe that if for some reason my baby stops breathing I am alarmed immediately. I had 1 false alarm and that was because she moved completely off of the board. I have been using this for 3 months and love it. Now if I can get my baby to sleep through the night I'd be set!
4,A MUST HAVE FOR PARENTS TO GET SOME SLEEP!,"I recently purchased this monitor for my 3 month old, and WOW do I wish I had sooner! I feel A BILLION times better about not sleeping with one eye open. I purchased it without the sound monitor because we already had one. But my daughter is in a co-sleeper next to me. I can actually get some sleep now! I have bought one for my SIL since she is pregnant, and I know she will sleep better than I did in the beginning. My only worry is how it will work in a regular crib with a full size mattress. I'm not sure how the sensitivity will be when a thicker mattress is involved.Just like other consumers, I wish it was bigger so that when she does start to move, she won't wiggle off the area. But to me, it's worth false alarms to have a peace of mind. Wish there was some way to have the BEBE company make this unit larger. This is the only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5."
3,Sound monitor has too much interference,I hear static and other people talking which makes the sound monitor almost useless. Maybe I live in an area that have a lot of other devices on the same frequency. I did not try the movement sensor yet so I have not comment on that. I am sure I would work as good as others have stated.
5,"Excellent product, works as advertised","We've been using this product for five months. In short, it works just as advertised. The extra motion sensor has given us extra piece of mind. We only had two false alarms both because our little girl scooted over to the very edge of the crib. The sound monitor occasionally is noisy (probably not more than any other sound monitor of this type), but we've always found a way to get it quiet again (e.g., switch from channel A to B, move the unit, plug it into a different outlet). I would recommend this product to anyone."
5,Peace of mind for preemie Moms!,"If you have a preemie or if your baby had any kind of apnea in the hospital, this is it! It's easy to use, and worth every penny. We have used it ever snce our little one came home from the hospital 3 months ago, and it has given us so much peace to know that she is safe. Her first night home we used a traditional monitor, and were constantly checking on her. After a night of no sleep, I went to the nearest Babies R Us and bought this monitor. AH, blessed sleep!"
5,First time mom,"Finding a monitor was a nightmare. We live in a townhouse/condo; we have people below and on the side. Also we are tech gurus and have computers. We received a few monitors at my baby shower and none of them worked, all static. We even went out and bought a video monitor that did not even work. Finally, we found the ultimate monitor, the Bebe Sounds Movement and Sound Monitor. Turned it on, no static. When my baby was a few months old, the alarm went off letting me know that my baby was not breathing. I immediately jumped up and picked up my baby. He turned out to be fine and I owe it to this monitor. Our baby is six months and his crib is still in our room. Even though the crib is right next to me, I still have the monitor on all the time."
5,Must have for all moms!,This is the very best gift you can get. Put it on your shower list or buy it yourself. You can sleep easier knowing if there is no movement for 20 seconds the alarm will sound.It works great! Everyone who saw it wishes they had something like that when they had children. The people who have kids run out and buy it.What an overdue invention.
1,Misleading picture.,"Adorama sent a completely different, cheaply made aluminum shoe that doesnot even fit Canon 430EX external flash for my T2i. Adorama was willing to refund the cost and did not even want me to send it back to them!"
4,Good product but did not use,Didn't use it. My son had something else to put on the leak in the boatUsed JB weld before and it is a good product
5,James learns the rainy day games of an assortment of friends,"This book has been a bed time favorite of both of our children. It combines counting, rhyming and repitition to create the adventure of James and his yellow rain coat as they find out the games that his animal friends play when it rains. This is an excellent book to use with four and five year olds to help introduce them to reading. The counting helps with math skills and there is a predictablility that allows children to feel they are really learning to read. I highly recommend this classic before it goes out of print!!"
5,"Oh, excellent","First, the book rhymes, and the rhythm is soothing and interesting.Second, it's a counting book -- one to ten. And it rhymes!Third, the illustrations are adorable -- playful and fun.Fourth, oh the rain! We are an Arizona family, and we love rain (when we can get it.)Great book -- very enjoyable. Did I mention that it rhymes? You'll love it."
1,Not Enough of Anything,"I thought this book would be helpful for either offering tips on certain tasks (e.g., searching for bugs, defensive driving). There is absolutely no substance! Topics are covered at a very high level, and too much space is given to mildly pertinent anecdotes. The grammer could also use a once-over. Finally, the book is way too brief.Keep searching - there are better books on this subject."
5,A Nuts-and-Bolts Primer,"""Executive Protection"" is a short but vital primer for anyone interested in pursuing a career as an executive/personal protection specialist. In a no-nonsense manner, Benny Mares debunks a lot of the myths surrounding this growing profession, tells you what skills and experience potential clients look for, and what the pitfalls of the job are and how to avoid them. A seminal work on a fascinating career."
5,A great book for anyone considering a career in protection.,Anyone considering a career in the field of Executive protection would benefit from reading this book. I encourage everyone to read this book before attending a formal Executive Protection course. I wish everyone who called me for an interview would have previously read Mr. Mares book and taken to heart the invaluable information that is provided.
4,good book,very interesting and good read. dont think you are going to read this and go off and join Blackwater Security i dont think it will happen
3,Satisfactory,Book is okay. But I would urge anyone to enroll in a bodyguard academy. Book doesn't cover the essential aspects of being a bodyguard.
3,"Okay, but dated","The content is good, but dated. This was written in 1994 and has not been updated. This book is a very high level overview of the field."
4,protection teaser,"ever want to learn more about a subject?, well after reading this tease on protection you will, It is very insightful but leaves you wanting more details on the protection subject."
2,Mark,"As with all casio watches they are a great watch and have owned lots of them. The problem I have with this model is the display. The numbers and other info are a light gray color, instead of black. Unless your looking directly at the display its real hard to read. When ya use the light the numbers are look black, go figure. I'm going to send it back because of the display."
1,Can't see it,"I agree with the other review I read that said the gray display is difficult to see. When I am out running, I don't want to have to stop to peer into my watch face to see what it's saying . . . This one is going back."
1,Simply boring!,"I read the reviews on this CD and based on them, purchased it. It's one of, if not the most, diappointing purchases I've made on Amazon. The production and performance quality are both marginal. I've tried to listen to the CD multiple times and can't get through it. I enjoy all types of music, but primarily listen to Blues, this CD made me blue."
3,"Hardware ok, not sure about software","The modem installed and was recognized just fine. I'm still trying to figure out the software interface (but I haven't spent too much time on it). So far I haven't been able to experience it working properly. It also keeps saying that caller ID (screening) is not available. Yet the modem shows to support it (there's a box it allowed me to check). I'm trying to use it on my main phone line (I use DSL to connect, not dial-up) to be able to send/receive faxes thru the computer. I want to make sure it's going to work correctly. I'm not convinced, at this point."
4,Does all at Great Price,Went in without a hitch. Still on V.90 line and performance over the previous TelePath with X2 by US Robotronic is improved. Can't go wrong for the price.
5,"Good Performance, [inexpensive] Price","I needed a new modem to replace the US Robotics that died in my windows 98 machine. I bought the Zoom model 3025. It claims to have ""lightning protection"" which is how my old one died. Hopefully I won't have to test that functionality. I have no technical experience, but this modem was very easy to install and run. It took me less than 10 minutes to install. The connection speeds have been consistently stable and fast, it has V.92 and V.44 for increased speed, and the price was [inexpensive]. If you're going to stay with 56K instead of broadband, then this is a good deal."
1,Zoom PCI Modem 3025,"Bought this modem because I have had several Zoom products in the past and all have worked flawlessly. Not with this one though. Installed the software and it seemed to be fine. It dials just fine, but immediately disconnects when connecting to the remote sever or dial-up service. I tried dialing into several different servers including their own with the same result. It just won't stay connected. I tried downloading the software from their site thinking it might be the disk, but, that didn't work either. I hooked up an old external and it connected without any problem. Don't waste your time or money with this one."
2,Buzzed,"I'd bought not 3025L, but 3025C and was very disappointed. After the modem initialization system often buzzes for 5 seconds and doesn't connect. I need try 4-5 times to receive stable connection. But when connection is stable, speed is about 50K."
1,Why they just only sell paper back?????,"I was looking for a hardcover expressways 4, but I couldn't find it here. Where are hard cover books??I'm so disappointed."
5,Expressways Activity Workbook,I am a teacher in an English as a Second Language ministry. We use Expressways Activity Workbooks. We have been very pleased with the results.
5,Great little switch,"I bought this one to replace a Dlink gigabit switch in my home network. The Dlink was running way hot, especially as my cat loved to sleep on top of it. It died, no doubt because of the heat. This one is still warm, but not nearly as hot. So the cat doesn't sleep on it as often. The case on the Trendnet is more solid. It is quiet (fanless) . It is my favorite color (blue). And it has 8 fast gigabit ports and is very affordable."
1,Can you say dud,"I have had this product for about a week and so far it has yet to work as anticipated. I have called tech support twice and waited for approximately 30 minutes to no avail. After 10 minutes someone will tell they will call you right back which never happens. If you call back and complain you will spend the rest of your life on hold. Don't waste your time or money, it is a dud."
4,Very moving personal memoir,"This book has done more than any other to give me a flavor of what it was like for Americans to be in China before, during and after the war. After reading it I feel as if I've sat down and listened to the author tell stories that she has lived. Perhaps the strongest point that comes through is the influence of place on the development of a child. She doesn't neglect the importance of the people who populate the place, but the constant theme is the land and how she sees it as she grows up. I only wish the pictures had printed a bit more clearly, as they are small and grainy and only give a vague idea. Her words do a fine job of painting much more vivid pictures, however."
3,all right,"my daughter and niece are close in age and like dora. myself, i dont really care because i find the show repetitive and boring especially when they stop to ask the kids a question and there is that pause. my daughter and niece don't answer because they know dora will find the answer anyway but all these pauses are boring, i just tune out and do something else while they watch it. my daughter got this as a birthday gift from her grandma since she is just three and for kids that age i would say dora is appropriate because there is no violence or bad words or anything. but i do hope she outgrows this soon! haha."
5,Beautiful Adventure,the colors and make of the Enchanted Forest are truly enchanting. Much more elaborate than the Dora episodes. My daughter loved it.
5,Exactly as expected!,"There are 3 parts to the story and all are great! My 3 1/2 yr old and 1 1/2 yr old LOVE this. If your child/grandchild, etc., love Dora the Explorer, then he/she will truly enjoy it."
1,you need to have very good eyes to see in this watch,i was deceived by this purchase because it is very hard to see the numbers in this watch. this is a contrast between brillant and mate color so i am not satisfied. the shape and design are good but not the way you can see the numbers in the watch.
1,Casio Women's White Baby-G Sweet Poison Watch,"I bought this watch for my Mom. However, she had to return it because the numbers were un-clear. What good is a digital watch, if you can not read the numbers to see what time it is? Please find another watch with a better display so you are not out of the cost and time of shipping, like I was."
3,Should have listened,"I REALLY like the style, color and features of this watch a lot but I should have listened to the reviews. It is hard if not down right impossible at times to read the display. It is frustrating and I am kind of sorry I did not send it back."
5,IVE HAD IT FOR 4 YEARS AND IT'S STILL GOOD,"I've got to add to the great review and say this is a great watch. Even after 4 years people still compliment my watch and ask if it's new. Im in the military, so black is as fancy as i can get while in uniform. I like it because its simple and convient. I recommend this watch to anybody!"
5,Great little ruler and recycled too,"Great ruler. I've been using it several times a week in my office for the past 1 1/2 years. The ruler is made with 70% recycled and is minimally packaged with just a recyclable paper sleeve around it. The ruler also features Microban, an antibacterial coating that the company says will never wear off. Sounds like it would be great in a classroom / office workroom setting."
2,TRIPLE C,"Dope album all around. All the tracks are bangin' and these guys flow to a lot of laid back oldie beats. They open the album with a cut flowin over another one bites the dust which was cool. I think that you got to like oldies to really appreciate this album, but you can decide for yourself. Standout cuts- world of the wicked, true, and I can't even remember the rest of them. It's got a long playing time so you get your money's worth. It's also got some contributions from CLS, dreamer, brownhood, and some of the other guys from the 805 records label. And it also has some nice singing from Sara S who was on the Central Coast Clique album. Check this one out definitely."
5,Good book.,"My 40 year old husband really enjoys these book. As a fan of Star Wars, he likes to read all of the various spin off books and he has really enjoyed these."
5,Full Charge,"I used these in my office vital signs, patient monitor. They received an initial full charge and maintained their capability for six(6) months before a recharge was required.Great product, competitively priced."
3,Didn't fit umbrella stand,"Very nice heavy duty quality, but didn't fit my umbrella stand. Diameter of pole was not the size listed in the specs. Sent it back. No problem."
3,Not their best release,"A couple of good songs on this album that's all that works,this album is not as great as their other releases (Fence The Clear,Presents Of Mind,Fly Paper)."
2,Not a winner for me,"Sorry, folks, in my opinion these guys should have remained a Rush tribute band playing at bars. I believe that's how they started, and I think that's where they still belong. The songs sound derivative, and there are places where the band members' capabilities are not up to the music they're trying to perform (especially some real klinker notes from the vocalist). I find I can't listen to much of this. I'd give it one star, but I do want to encourage bands with any progressive bent..."
3,fashon pack,clothing difficult to put on. shoes dont stay on. Not much clothing for amount paid for.
4,It's Cute. Could be more colorful.,"I like it. but It could have better colors.Baby Bratz Crazy,~*Princess Stella"
2,Faribault Mills Americana Whip Stitched Queen Blanket,"I ordered two of these blankets in separate orders. Both were thinner and lighter weight than I expected them to be. The two blankets, although the same brand and style, seemed to vary in thickness. I found the first one I ordered one was thinner and lighter than the second one. I was especially dissappointed with the thickness and weight of the first blanket. It was much thinner than I expected from a mid-weight blanket. I would have returned it but I had company coming to stay over and there was not time to return it and order a new one before they arrived. I liked the color."
1,"If you don't mind a potential house fire, buy this hair dryer","Bought two of these hair dryers, one of them stopped working after two weeks, I mean, it simply stopped working, which is, much better than the second one, which, has a strong burning smell when using. Botton line is, the second one works, and it works, something just seemingly burning inside. I had returned both for a refund since."
4,"Works well, if it works","Though not stated in the product information, this dimmer has 4 brightness levels.I ordered two. When they arrived one worked fine, the other not at all. Called the seller and they sent a replacement without requesting a return of the bad unit. So T&B; product quality is not great, but Ace Hardware customer service was! I can't comment on the other sellers."
5,Love this!!,"I replaced my touch lamps in by bedroom with a set that better matched the decor, but hated that they were not touch sensitive. I am an EMT and getting up in the middle of the night is a bit easier when the bright lamps aren't blaring in my eyes, so I loved my touch lamps that I could hit once and it was just bright enough to see to get dressed. This works perfectly. It has 4 settings, the cable from the box to the touch pad is very long allowing it to go anywhere, and the touch pad itself is small (a bit bigger than a golf ball) so it isn't in the way... in fact, I used a command strip to attach the pad to the side of my night stand where it is very easy to get to, but you'd never know it was there. Totally worth it to turn any lamp into a touch lamp."
1,"ugly, too many settings","Yes,,, too many settings. Can't I just have on and off? Well, yeah... this product said it had multiple settings but after using it for a few days I found it more of a pain to cycle through all of them rather then just reach a little further and switch the light off manually."
2,Below average Sequel,"Tremors was a homage to the 1950's horror classics. Tremors 2 was a decent enough sequel that it had enough comedy to keep you entertained, high tech weapons to show, and gave you enough Burt Gummer that you enjoyed the movie. So the producers thought that even more Burt would be a better movie.It could have been. But going back to tired old cliches of running out of ammo, and blowing up his place - sorry, been there done that. Not funny anymore. Bad script writing destroys what could have been a good movie."
2,A Lost cause !,"this is a tremors film or a evening of twlight zone i don't know you tell me ? i thought it'd be good but it was ok , but very boring & annoying new additions the only thing holding this film together was michael gross as burt gummer & the actors from the first film were great to see again. but only pet peeve was that some of shots looked like they were done by high school students with cheap video editing programs so the shots looked like crap i'm sorry i would'nt buy this one in a million years it's a shame to the trilogy i'm sorry to say & this coming from a big tremors fan what a disappointment!"
2,a disappointment really,"I was disappointed in this one. Gross comes back as Burt and Fred Ward like Kevin Bacon in the first one doesnt come back but some other ones from the first one come back as themselves in this one. remember the annoying kid in the first one who was stuck on top of that shed, well hes back. goes good but its stupid premise, assblaster tremors, not a good name and it wears down the plot that the first one had. bummer"
2,Dumbest of the Series,"I don't know when they will quit making Tremor movies, from what i understand #4 is on it's way, they get dumber everytime. Number one is a classic, two was passible, but this one is far behind, the acting in this is pretty bad, and cheesy. I gave it two stars because i was somewhat entertained. Don't spend alot of money on this, if your planning to buy it."
3,Not quite perfection,"I didn't even know this was out until I passed by it in the sci-fi area of my local video store. I enjoyed Tremors 2 a lot, and always found myself leaving it on when it would show up on the USA channel (seems to be on there all summer). I was expecting a lot more from Tremors 3. It lacked a lot of what made the first two movies truly fun to watch. The 'buddy' movie aspect is totally lost as the lead characters never really meld. Burt himself was always a loner character and should stay that way. He just doesn't play-off of anyone in this movie the way he did when he was a secondary character. Anyway, if you liked the first two, you owe it to yourself to at least rent this one to complete the storyline. It's hard to recommend buying it considering these movies are always (strangely) priced in the $21+ category instead of the $10-$15 area where they belong."
1,totally sucks!!!,I would rather stick hot french fries in my eyes than watch this horrible movie. The first 2 were really good but I am letting my dog use the third movie as a chew toy!!!
1,"bad language, poor script, not for kids, bad acting","This is a very poor sequel, bad language, poor acting. NOT a family movie, not worth watching, sorry but the first one was good, but not this one."
5,Fantastic Movie,"A must buy! Some people thought the acting was poor, it isn't, some people thought the who movie was terrible, it certainly was not. The movie was a good movie, good acting and it was great to see a grown up Mindy without her pogo stick.The sorry line would not be to everyone's liking, but I thought it was good and it leaves space for a fourth Tremors movie, lets hope Kevin Bacon comes back. Ariana Richards was great as Mindy, Charlotte Stewart was good as Mindy's mom Nancy.Buy it now!"
4,"OK, But Not As Good As The First Two","This movie was OK With some good scenes but all the CGI shots had to been the worst effects I had ever seen (I Thought Jurassic Park III Was Bad!) The only thing i don't get is why in the beginning it shows burt killing all the shriekers with the gun on his truck. after that, the gun never comes into the movie at all, what was the use of that scene? Last thing, on the DVD it isn't really WIDESCREEN like it says, I Have the VHS + DVD and all the DVD does it cut off some of the top and bottem and says it's widescreen! Well, all in all it was a pretty good movie"
3,Welcome Back to Perfection!!!,"The good thing about this movie is they got most of the original cast to return, except for Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward. The bad thing is that this sequel is nowhere near as good as the original. Burt Gummer returns to Perfection, Nevada and it's too boring. Soon, a Graboid returns and changes into an 'Ass-Blaster' because they can fly by shooting fire from their [...]. Burt teams up with Jack Sawyer and Jodi Chang to try and stop them. If you're a hardcore fan, you might enjoy TREMORS 3: BACK TO PERFECTION!!!"
2,Far from perfection,"Well, nobody could have expected the first movie with its giant, burrowing worms to be as good as it was. And we certainly didn't have any right to expect that the sequel to that film would be nearly as clever and entertaining. With this third installment, the ""Tremors"" series finally ran out of gas. Burt Gummer (Michael Gross) was excellent comic relief, but he's too much of a characature to command leading man status. The tired script doesn't require the characters to think their way out of their dilemma the way the previous two movies did. A scene in which Burt survives being swallowed is particularly ridiculous, as is the latest matamorphosis of the graboids."
3,Just for Fun,"If you are looking for a complicated, deeply moving movie, this is not what you want. This is strictly a film for light entertainment purposes only. I personally love the entire Tremors series. Tremors 3 takes you back to Perfection to find yet another form of Graboids causing problems for the residence of this tiny town. There is a new store owner,a guide service and what would Perfection be without Burt Gummer?It's fun, it's light and it's entertaining. It's a nice break from some of the other ""heavier"" films."
3,Unfortunately I was bored . . . . .,"I give the book 3 stars because the writing is good, the two main characters are interesting, even the villains are okay, but I was terribly bored. I realize Historical Romances are pretty standard by nature, but some hold my interest more than others. While well-written, Intimate Enemies did not hold my interest past the first couple of chapters. Sorry."
4,good Read; a little bit predictable,"Good Romantic Read. However, the geographical/territorial tale is a bit unrealistic whereby England and Scotland share equal ownership of an island within the historical setting of the book. The romance is enjoyable with the heroine's bravery being above average. Due to the fact that the heroine's betrothed is introduced so late in the book, readers can undeniable guess the evil plot that will unravel towards the end of the story. The clan's indecision regarding its leadership and ally struggles pretty much reminds you a little bit of the similar clan issues described in so many Scottish-taled books and movies (i.e. Braveheart).This book lacks a bit of imagination, suspense and intrigue. The relationship between the two protagonists is definitely witty and thus why the rating is slightly above average."
1,Absolutely ridiculous!,"I agree completely with Joe Levi. The suggestion that English Jews are in some way responsible for 9/11 is totally and utterly preposterous.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realise that Muslim fundamentalists were guilty of this appalling tragedy. Jews represent only a tiny minority of the English population and very few hold positions of power let alone influence events in America and Israel. I can only assume that this book was written by Nazi sympathiser/Nazi using a false name. It would be good to see a book published on the evils of Muslim fundamentalists, who distort the Koran to suit their thirst for power and domination.As a Christian, I recommend that you avoid this book since it is likely to cause great offence to anyone who suffered as a result of 9/11."
1,Idiotic!,"This book is about as convincing as Osama Bin Laden would be if he told the world that he loved America and would kill millions of Muslims, who dare to oppose Bush. The author, probably Kim using an assumed name, provides a significant amount of fictitious historical evidence to support his main argument i.e. English Jews were responsible for 9/11. Most readers will find this book nauseating, especially if they have read Kim's other anti-Semitic literary works. The following example is typical of the assumptions made by Kim, regarding the behaviour of Jews: According to Christian Kim, if you know a Jew, you know he's going to be very pro-Israel. Apparently Kim's personal experience affirms some of the points of the book. Anyone who has met Kim will know that the above assumptions are nonsensical and they merely show how ridiculous this book really is.Please avoid this idiotic book."
5,Jewish Royalty in England Causes Greater Problems,"Did you know that there are Jewish royalty in England? Yes, daughters of wealthy Jews or wealthy Jews who married royalty and became royalty via marriage. Being that the royalty is the head of the Episcopalian Church/Anglican Church -- it's ludicrous. In other words, Jews have a lot of social clout and political power in England -- probably far greater than in the USA. And that's saying a lot. Given this reality, it's no surprise that these wealthy Jews in England with social and political power will abuse their power to push Jewish interest and Jewish agenda. I wish Mr. Pradesh would have treated the issue of Jewish royals and their contribution to 9/11. Maybe he'll do that in the future? Otherwise, I found this book most informative and helpful."
4,Fine artist; she sounds old.,"I have respected Jan DeGaetani for over 35 years of record listening.I like the idea of chamber accompaniment for these songs.It is well recorded.You can enjoy the singing here and appreciate the intelligence behind it.BUT I would have appreciated it if any reviewer had warned that DeGaetani's voice sounds like that of an older woman, and perhaps even a weak one. Hard to say what I would have ""heard"" if I did NOT know she was dying of leukemia when she recorded this, but when the chamber ensemble plays more loudly they do seem to overwhelm the voice. Just a balancing problem? Not so sure.This is not a bad CD and it's a good souvenir, but you should know what you are buying and why."
4,"Long lasting, effective without scratching pots and casserole dishes","I was frustrated with the short life and messy brown residue that remains from steel wool pads such as brillo. These pads last for months before becomming too stretched out, and they haven't scratched a single pot or dish. I put them onthe top shelf of the dishwasher to santize them. They are more ecologic and economical than any disposable steel wool pad. Highly recommended."
5,My Mom's Favorite,"These are the one and only sponges my mom uses on her nice-expensive cookware set. Actually, most ladies in my families are fans. I got some on my bridal shower and been using them since!"
1,Music is beautiful,Though the music is beautiful. I believe he does not want to play a standard classical guitar because it might be too difficult for him. I saw him play in a recital on 4/25/99 and was very disappointed because of his (Andres Segovia would say A FERVENT INCOMPETENT). Poor left hand technique and RIGHT HAND TECHNIQUE. And the people i took to see him were very disappointed because hi would move from left to right making one dizzy. We could not hear the Guitar because he played a early 1800's guitar.
5,Excellent Desert Book!,"WOW! It has everything: plants, animals, experiments, people, places, etc! Nice color drawings but real ones would have been the sprinkles on the icing! Right amount of info and pictures. Excellent resource for reports (elementary), projects and home schools."
1,Don't Bother,"Very vague, incomplete and short. There is no information here that cannot be obtained via the web for free. You'll have better results from googleing the subject that you'll get by purchasing this."
2,Concise but hard to understand,"This book is very different from the myriads of verbose biology textbooks out there. The language is very concise, and so this relatively thin textbook may cover as much material as one that's twice as thick. However, the English is often hard to understand, perhaps because it's orginally written in French and then translated into English."
4,Perfect Angel - A devil of a book!,"This book will definately leave your brain racked. When I read it, I had changed my mind about the killer...countless times! Right when you think you know who it is, there's an ever bigger suspicion on a different character. It will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat.The author switches Points of View from thrid person then goes inside The Wizard's (the killer) twisted world, only giving you chopped up bits and peices of what The Wizard is up to and doing.I would really recommend this book to anyone who has a love for mysteries and suspense novels. Kudos to the author!"
3,Wizard who are you?,"From the very beginning this book has you asking questions. Suspenceful and tricky this book is a twisted time-guzzler. Although I didn't enjoy being spoonfed information at times, I found myself switching who I thought was the main suspect. A good beginning, a bloody,suspenceful,angelic middle, and an overall good end. (But the angel thing gets a little old)"
5,KC IN TEXAS,"THIS IS AN AMAZING BOOK! WRITTEN BY A PASTOR THAT HAS BEEN THROUGH THE WARZONE. SO MANY BOOKS ARE JUST TEACHINGS, THIS IS MORE OF A TESTIMONY THAT WILL TEACH YOU. I READ THIS YEARS AGO AND HAVE FOUND HIS TEACHING/TESTIMONY TO BE TRUE AND USEFULL. STEP UP TO THE PLATE SEE WHY THINGS EXIST THE WAY THE DO."
1,Terrible,"I thought this would be another, lovely, whimsical, family movie. But is was very, VERY slow. The characters (which are the essence of a movie like this) were completly lost. It was very dull. Not a movie I would every suggest."
1,Dreadful,"This movie shows the crime of nepotism: if the director had not been Walter Matthau's son, he never would have gotten financial backing for this piece of tedium. I so loved Truman Capote's novella THE GRASS HARP, I thought a movie version of it couldn't go wrong. But it is slow, sloppily directed, tedious. Read the book, it's a charming novella, but save yourself two hours of boredom by skipping this movie. I wish I had."
5,grass harp review,great movie. pace keeps your interest. stories within the story. has points about life.great service from seller.
2,Slow Paced Charmer,"The main fun of this film is picking out the stars oftenplaying minor roles. In the movie Carrie, Piper Laurieplayed Sissy Spacek's religious fundamentalist mother. Inthis film the roles are reversed with Spacek playing Laurie'sdomineering sister. Keep an eye out for Walter and CharlesMatthau, Nell Carter, Jack Lemmon, Mary Steenburgen, JoeDon Baker, Charles Durning, Roddy McDowall and Doris Roberts(Mildred on Remington Steele).The movie is extremely slow paced. You know how moviesoften go syrupy right at the end where the actors startmouthing platitudes and smiling benignly into the sunset orrunning over fields. This movie goes on like that for thelast 20 minutes of the movie. It became so unbearablysaccharine I started laughing.The other pleasure of this movie is the recreations agentler time, the south in the 1930s. Lavish interiors,antique cars, prudish townspeople and nature in fall coloursare a feast for the eye."
2,What I Wish...,"This is definitely a beginner level book. I wanted to say (a) I am not retarded, and (b) Did the author mainly research Catholicism for the book throughout? There are Christian religions that are completely different, you know, Mr. Schoen."
1,Don't bother with this book.,"I don't mean to be negative about Schoen's book, but Loyola Press should not have published it. It is extremely watered down and lacks any substance. There are WAY BETTER books out there about the basics of Judaism. I don't expect a lay person to write a tome on the subject, but if you can't even describe the Orthodox movement, for example, in more than five short paragraphs, you have no business writing the book.There is not one citation in the entire book of a secondary source...NOT ONE! And there are very few scriptural citations. I'm not Jewish and I knew more about Judaism than what's in this book before I got my Master's in Jewish Studies. The confirmation chapter is only two paragraphs long...A HALF A PAGE! Gee thanks for all the knowledge that you have to share.I recommend, ""This is My GOD"" by Wouk; or ""What Do Jewish People Think about Jesus, and Other Questions Christians Ask about Jewish Beliefs, Practices, and History"" by Michael L. Brown"
4,Light and comfortable.,I wanted a bike helmet that was not pointed in the back like most seem to be. I was pleased with the way this one looks. It is cool to wear and light. The only difficulty I had was in adjusting the straps as suggested by the instructions. I eventually called the manufacturer for instructions. They were very helpful. I got the straps adjusted and am pleased with the helmet.
4,Just not a Giro head,"While this is a killer helmet, I just didn't have the ""it fits me feel"", regardless of how it was adjusted. I have more of a Uvex head, as they fit me very well right out of the box. This Giro, is more suited for rounder craniums...If you understand motorcycle talk,,,you either have a round or oval shape skull....This is more for the rounders out there. Be aware though,,,although no secret, no MAY NOT get a brand new helmet...The one I was sent came in crushed original box, literally smashed. so I was extra cautious ....now you wear the helmet not the box, just had to send back due to fitment , but It is a solid product with many years in the bike world."
4,Great head protection,"Need to try before you buy. Might not fit if your head is ""less round."" Paired it with a helmet mounted tail light and dont even know either is there."
4,Budget Zen,"I almost got Giro Zen. But the high price made me think twice. Then I came accross this Hex. It is not as perfect fit as Zen to me, but still comfortable. It has similar features as Zen, with a lot less price. It even has better looking then Zen in my opinion. Highly recommended if it fits you."
3,"Slow shipping, good product","You'd think that with all the negative reviews about their shipping time that they would do something about it, but no. I waited seven days before they even shipped the product, then seven more for it to get here. Helmet arrived in good condition though."
3,This will do for now,"Pros:Air ventilation is truly excellent, fit is snug and comfortable, feels very light, the visor does not chatter in the wind, the helmet's design is fairly stylish.Cons:The straps often need to be pushed away from the back of my ears, the rubber part of ""overmolded arm"" on the RocLoc system inside the helmet interferes with the back tips of my glasses.The helmet is used mainly for my daily commute. The RocLoc system makes the helmet fit well but at the expense of not being able to wear sunglasses comfortably. I wanted to try the Giro brand after I wore out my excellent Bell X-Ray helmet. When this Giro Hex wears out I will replace it with a new Bell X-Ray."
5,I haven't found a better source for ice hockey conditioning,"Peter Twist covers all aspects of conditioning to play hockey regardless of the level of play. He dedicates a significant amount of text to youth hockey players. This book is an essential read for youth hockey coaches, although it can be best applied to high school and above. Athletes that can adopt his methods, including nutritional guidance will have the edge."
3,Great pictures -- Good content,"So far I've only used the book for brake work and for a minor O2 sensor diagnostic problem. The pictures are very detailed and useful, but there were some instances where parts have been removed to get a better picture and may not reflect the actual working conditions. The main text and pictures do not include specs for sizes, torques, etc., and can be a little difficult to find elsewhere in the manual. Overall, the book is done pretty well; and even though it may not be exact, it doesn't seem to be too difficult to figure out."
3,Sticky,"We found this product to have adequate coverage, but it goes on sticky and makes the skin feel tight. We even stuck to our towels after using it."
4,Wonderful program of 20th century music performed brilliantly,"This is a very strong cd. I am particularly fond of ""Toward The Sea"" and ""Another's Fandango."" Starobin's playing and tone are beautiful."
5,A compilation of the year's eighteen best short stories,"Enthusiastically recommended reading, New Stories From The South: 2004 is knowledgeably compiled and expertly edited by Shannon Ravenel and a compilation of the year's eighteen best short stories. Ravenel (series editor of ""The Best American Short Stories"" for fourteen years and who inaugurated the ""New Stories from the South"" series in 1986) is uniquely qualified to assemble the best of southern storytelling and storytellers, thereby making them accessible to those who enjoy great literature throughout the country. From Edward P. Jones' A Rich Man, Ingrid Hill's Valor, to Brock Clarke's The Lolita School, to Bret Anthony Johnston's The Widow, these are true gems reflecting the phenomena of love in all its diverse variations and generations."
4,Nice piece of Jewelery,Was very pleased to see a very nice quality piece of jewelery. Made for a great gift.
3,Hard to put together,"I purchased this item for my 6 yr old daughter for Christmas. It was something she really wanted and it was a gift from Santa. I took it out of the box on Christmas eve to put it together and found that the roof of the stable had 5 small broken pieces in it. Since it was Christmas eve, I could not replace it. I put it together anyway thinking that she would probably not notice the missing pieces in the roof. I found it very difficult to put the sections together. The directions are pretty vague- mainly pictures and no words. The hard plastic pieces did not want to snap together and I was afraid if I pushed too hard then they would bust. I was able to get it together well enough for her to receive it on Christmas, but I was very disappointed in the quality of shipping and how hard it was to fit the pieces together (they are still not together all the way). I do have to say that my daughter does enjoy playing with the stable."
1,What a Waste of Money,"I will never again buy a toy based on the picture.My 5 year old loves horses and I thought she'd love this toy but...it's made of cheap plastic, it doesn't open and it's too small inside to even fit her hand inside. I finally separated the two halves so she could get her hand inside the thing. The accessories are tiny and made of cheap plastic. The fence is very flimsy and doesn't stay upright.It's absolutely without a waste of money. If I'd bought it from a local store, I'd take it back. We just opened it yesterday and it's already pretty much discarded."
4,Warning for Minivan Owners,"Being the coolest minivan driver around, I bought one of these to make my 2009 Kia Sedonna minivan even more bad*ss then it already is. Unfortunately, the location of the receiver is so low to the ground (as it may be with all minvans with fold into the floor rear seats), the chin of the skull hit the ground and the skull broke off the first time I backed out of my suburban home driveway. This is not the fault of the manufacturer, but buyer beware that the chin hangs down an inch or so below your receiver and you may have ground clearence problems. At least I was totally awesome for a few hours until I backed my minivan out to the road the first time."
5,Hubby loves it.,This product was expensive in the stores and I found it cheaper here. The husband loves it.
3,just ok,the skull was very nice and shiny. but the inside hitch cracked and the LED lights went out. i had to remove from my truck a couple months after i installed it
5,Cool!,Gave it to someone as a gift and they hooked it up easily and it looked great! Would do it too if I had a truck.
2,skip it,"Skip it, go buy a dicks picks, you'll feel better. I found this book in a remainder bin, ignored like a mother who doesnt talk to its baby, and the baby shrivels up and dies. Read this book and asked myself, how's your head? Yet another attempt to nurse the dead's legacy, by recycling lots of familiar stuff. Go to the library, get out the readers guide, and make yer own, you'll have a better time."
5,Very HOT!,"Got this as an ""I love you"" gift for my 5'3"", 130 pound wife. It fits beautifully and looks terrific on her!"
5,Excellent Treasury,"I'll be brief as I believe the prior reviews address the remarkable treasures in this archive. The collection indicates some extraordinary innovation that took place in the early days of film. It is not an issue of lost art and capabilities, but rather the wonderful ability to stretch beyond the capabilities of the time, to tell remarkable stories. You cannot watch the feature and short length pieces without marveling at the practitioners of the art. I can watch Charlie Bowers' ""There it is"" over and over. Wonderful archive."
1,"Thin plastic, Cracked on Arrival",Not real durable. Plastic is really thin. It was cracked when I took it out of the box and didnt even get to use it once. Returned and requested refund.
1,Do Not Buy It,The product came with the manufacturers name plate & SR# removed.It did not work out of the box.My money was returned & Amazon returned the S&H.I can't see how this could be a new product as advertised.
2,one of my worst experiences,"after being assured that this product was in stock, I ordered it. That's when my nightmare began. First I was sent a bogus tracking number and when I emailed the dealer about that they told me they would send me another tracking number. I waited and waited but it was not forthcoming, finally began one of several I'm sorry but there has been a delay emails. I explained to them that I was on a time issue as it was for my daughter and she would be returning to college soon and that if they couldn't get it to me in time I would have to purchase another changer locally so I would prefer a refund. I did have to purchase another changer before she left, did not get a refund, received the changer approx 1 week after she left. Will never do business with Dealercost again."
3,Great book--but not my favorite!,"On Green Dolphin StreetNever thought the 60's could be interesting, but Sebastian Faulks manages to write about this politically turbulent time in a very intriguing manner. This novel is both a post-war/cold-war psychological study and a full throttle story of love's infidelity. It is always enjoying to read Faulks' British perspective, in On Green Dolphin Street it is particularly interesting to see America through these British eyes; particularly the Kennedy era. Mary is a well-developed character who provides a portal to a wealth of human emotion ranging from her strong attachment to her children, her moral struggles as the wife of an alcoholic and her wrenching grief when faced with death/dying.This novel is quieter than all of Sebastian Faulks' other novels, but its message is just as deep and meaningful while delivering a history steeped in fact."
2,Boring,"It is hard for me to believe this book was written by the same author of Charlotte Gray and Birdsong! I am struggling to finish this book knowing full well that it is not going to improve one iota.I find the characters weak and uninteresting. The affair between the faithful wife and this WWII veteran from Chicago turned journalist is hard to imagine.This book is genuinely boring. How many bars, restaurants, geographic locations and prominent landmarks do we need to read about. Who cares! So the author is well travelled. This is an unimportant book.There is not much else to say other than I truly believe this was written by someone other than Faulks or that he has lost what I found superb in Birdsong."
2,brief encounter,"Faulks does a ""Brief Encounter"" type plot here as well as trying to show us he can do ""cold war"" as well as ""france"" in his dense, hyper-psychologically aware prose. The problem is that the historical background is in no way integral to the story and, one senses, only marginally important to the plot. Occasionally interesting journalistic type vignettes eg. Vietnam, Kennedy Nixon debate etc. give some colour to this pedestrian and humourless love triangle."
5,Fantastic,"This movie has the makings of what you would expect from a Hollywood studio. I was extremely happy I took the time to watch this film. It is beautifully shot, entertainingly written, professionally acted and wonderfully directed."
4,Mary surratt,This film was educational as well as entertaining and suspenseful. Afetr seeing this film I noticed that hollywood was producing a full motion picture on the same topic. Nice Job Watermark films
5,The Killing Of Mary Surratt,"This video is much shorter than expected but in the end was worth watching. This information was never heard of in school history classes but should have been. We never heard of Mary Surratt and to find out she was possibly connected to President Lincoln's assassination and was the first woman to be executed was noteworthy. Wonder what other important things in our history have been ""left out."""
4,Another take on Frankenstein.,"Another fun read in the form of Frankenstein's journal from Frankenstein.This one is filled with some gruesome and lovely pictures of Victor's experiments and how he came to create his monster....including his own sketch of the Creature itself!It fearures the ""original text"" from the journal,it whatever shape of form(alot of fragments and pieces,letters and notes included) and there is a neatly written translation of the entire thing at the end of the book.A fun read and appropiately creepy for anyone interested in the Frankenstein story."
3,Good book for start-up consultant,"Mr. Bly has been in this business for a long time. He gives his own address, phone number, home page, ... which is unusual. His personal approach may just work in this economy.What the book does not tell you, is how you can get consulting assignment in the first place. Being all things to all people will not work."
2,Check out the ingredients.. it's not really buckwheat,"I've had good buckwheat pancakes before from the mix. After moving to a more rural area, this is what they had in the store so I picked up some. The ""organic"" label made it look more genuine.However, when I started making it, we noticed that the cooked product was awfully light in color and simply didn't have that buckwheat flavor. We looked at the ingredients on the box, and while it lists buckwheat as an ingredient, regular wheat flour is in fact the main ingredient. Buttermilk was also listed on there.Now, I'm not sure if wheat is usually the main ingredient on buckwheat mixes, but this tastes like they really cut it down and just wanted to make a buck off the name.Very sad. They make acceptable regular pancakes, but a good buckwheat pancake it does not."
2,Suddenly it stoped working,"I did not use it a lot. I used it 6-8 times last year. When I used it, it worked great. Bu After a year it stopped working at all"
5,Outstanding Book,"I highly recommend The Ballad of Blue Eagle, it is an outstanding book. I truly enjoyed reading it. The characters are wonderful, and the colorful pictures vividly bring the characters to life. The book has an excellent story line, and the song at the back of the book is fun to sing along with children. Children of fall ages will love this book."
3,Diamond Street,"Interesting, you have to be from Hudson and be born at least prior to 1960 to appreciate it."
5,A great addition to an EQphile's library...,"Or really, anybody interested in fantasy storytelling. The Gatherum really doesn't have anything really to do with the RPG -- I don't remember a thing in it that'd really help an EQ gamer out. It's really just a bunch of background material -- and by ""bunch"", I mean hundreds of pages of photos, interviews, drawings, background, source material, and reference stuff. This isn't so much a guidebook to Elfquest as an illumination of how it came to be. Some of the essays are written by the Pinis, and others are by admirers and friends.EQ readers will probably appreciate the essay about how Recognition works, but there's lots more there to love."
3,just O.K,"I got the earrings few weeks ago, and even though they are pretty, the back of it looks cheap. You cant see it in the pictures but the frame of the back of the earrings are empty giving it a cheap look. I got it for my mom but I decided to keep it to myself and get her something else."
5,An Amazing Psychologial Thriller,"I have to strongly disagree with all who claim that this book is not scary. While the book takes a (welcome) turn from the mythical and supernatural vampire lore, it is anything but tame. The beauty and horror of Laslow is that it could actually have happened. Roderick Anscombe takes you inside the mind of the famous Translyvanian serial killer allowing you to glimpse what drives him to his deeds and also the disgust he feels for his own actions. He fights his dark desires while he can, but his ""hunger"" for blood always wins in the end. His pyschological obsession for it overcomes even the physical need portrayed in classical Vampire legend. All in all and excellent read, mind expanding and thought provoking. Silence of the Lambs meets Hamlet."
3,clips are a pain,"The lights are fine, but the clips for attaching them to the tree are so tight that it was a real pain to get them attached. I eventually resorted to using the hooks that we use to hang ornaments on the tree, even though that left the lights dangling."
2,horrible colors,"orange and yellow are not christmas colors, and the pictures inply they screw on and off, I can't figure how???"
5,"If It's Selected By Fenriz, This Is The Ultimate Compilation","How can anybody rate this less than 5 stars? It is a selection of Black Metal by an artist of Black Metal, not by some label claiming to have the ultimate Black Metal compilation. And DARKTHRONE's Fenriz is no stranger to Black Metal."
1,It Sucked,"This charger wouldn't charge my phone because Motorola puts a chip in the phones so you have to buy a charger from Motorola.The company that I got my charger from knew this are should have,now I have a useless charger so beware!!!!!!!!"
2,Excessive shipping charges,The shipping charge was more than the price of the product. Seems a bit excessive!!!
1,DOA,"Dead on arrival. Smells like cigarettes. Strongly suspect it's actually used or refurbished. It's too cheap ($5) to bother with an exchange, which is probably the key to their business model."
1,A waste of money,"I bought an external battery pack for my daughter before a long trip to Africa, and she was delighted until she was on the plane trying to use the battery pack - it was a disaster, since it keeps the iPOD going, but the songs do not advance, so it was basically worthless."
1,different item than ordered,"My husband wanted the McGuire-Nicholas 695-CC carpenter pouch and when it arrived yesterday, it is a different item although the item numbers are the same. My husband wanted the pouch with the cloth hammer handles at the bottom on each side. The one received has metal hammer handles which get caught on things and pose a safety hazard for him. He needed it for work today and that is why we ordered from Amazon."
3,A great package for intermediate users,"This is a great product for those that already have some background in Thai speaking, and are trying to brush up on the language. This course might be a little more difficult for someone that is just beginning to learn the language. As a beginner myself, I found it very difficult to keep up with the dialogue, but could find it useful for people that already know the basics of Thai."
5,Good introduction for the vacationer,"I bought this book to learn a little Thai before taking a vacation in Thailand. A great introduction to the Thai alphabet! Also, I found the phrases and topics covered very useful for my trip. If you are looking to do something besides vacationing, then you might look elsewhere, but this was perfect for our needs. I loved having the CD with the book. They absolutely would not be useful one without the other. Being able to see what I was saying and listen to how to say it was very helpful."
1,definitely NOT for beginners,"We tried this out and had great difficulty. The lessons presuppose some knowledge of the language, it seems, as the lessons cruise along way too fast. First given a scenario, then a dialogue, then asked questions....can't possibly keep up. Both of us speak several languages, and learn quickly, but this course didn't help us at all to pick up Thai."
1,You can't sing along when there is no music!,I was very disappointed in the quality of this book. The condition was so-so and I thought I was buying a sing a long book that would have the music and chords to it. Instead it was more of a history/b io of Burl Ives with the words to some of his songs.
4,Gorgeous and intimate.,"I saw this documentary when it premiered at Hot Docs in 2006, and have been waiting since then for its DVD release. As a documentary producer myself, it inspired me to delve into a project that would reveal the intimate and personal details of the life of an artist. I found it compelling, funny at times, sad, and very informative of Sally Mann's life and creative process."
5,Fast shipping,I was slightly sad when I ordered this item because I was told it would probably not be here by Christmas. It was my own fault for buying it so close to the Holiday. In reality the item arrived several days before Christmas and I was elated. It was in perfect condition.
5,what remains,fantastic documentary. very nostalgic and inspiring. very real. i have immense respect and admiration for sally mann.
3,Not as good but good,The real cartridge has better clarity and lasts longer. But these are cheap to buy in packs of two. I buy these.
1,Wrong Product,I ordered a red glitter rolling stones sticker with a glittery silver outline. I received a rollings stones traditional style patch. I emailed the company requesting them to contact me to swap the patch for the sticker and they never contacted me back. It has now been over a month almost and I gave up. I will not shop with this company again.
2,Just OK,"I bought this book hopeing to get into shape for my wedding, I find it dificult to follow. Yes she does map out a plan but you have to filp back and forth and practilly memorize the book before you go to the gym to get the moves down!"
1,"Not much 80's, not much worth owning","First off, very few of the tracks on this CD were released in the 1980s. Most are from the 70s and a few are actually from the 90s! A lot of the tracks are live versions (SEPTEMBER, PRETTY WOMAN, MORE THAN A WOMAN) and several are re-recordings rather than the originals (WALKING ON SUNSHINE, RING MY BELL.) Then you have the bootleg/public domain songs by Kim Carnes & Donna Summer. Terrible sound quality (you won't even recognize Carnes' distinctive voice) - fans are advised to stay far away. There's really nothing to recommend about this CD. Countless other compilations have the words ""best"" and ""80's"" in their titles. Seek out any of those instead."
5,perfect!!!,I've been looking for a good strudy case on wheels and this is perfect. The top portion is about as big as the biggest sephora case and it also comes with a set of keys and straps. The bottom portion comes with a top and another set of keys. It is basically 2 cases in one. The bottom 1/2 is big enough to hold bottles and hair supplies and anything that is bulky suck as face wipes and brush cleaner! The bottom also has strap things to hold bottles!!
5,Amazing!,"What can one say about Jonathan Edwards and ""The Religious Affections!?"" Amazing. After being brought up on Christian book store material such as Lucado, Warren, etc. (who are not bad men, just a little weak), Edwards is a difficult, yet overwhelmingly breath of fresh air.The first section which catalogs signs and things are not necessarily signs of true religious affections goes a little long, but the last section which speaks of our love and actions being the primary evidence of our professed faith will grip you for hours. Amazing."
4,Important literature,"He tends to be repetitive. But when he does get to the kernel of the Christian faith, he's impressive. The last part of his book is probably the best of his work in this book."
5,Sublime,"The collaboration level between Sultan Khan and Zakir Hussain is phenomenal. This is one of the finest recorded performances of Indian Music that I have ever heard. The tabla accompaniment is brilliant, Zakir at his best. Raga Yaman - 63 minutes. Definitely worth pursuing."
2,Iomega Zip Drives 100MB Single PC/MAC,I have used these zips in the past and they have a tendency to quit working for no apparent reason.However I still use them on a MAC at work for certain projects. The newest problem I've encountered is totry and reformat the Zips to a newer operating system MAC OS10. It wouldn't reformat.So I do not recommend the Zip Drives for newer operating systems. On the older computers they should work fine.
3,Outdated Mapbook is a Danger,"Amazon's description tells it all. Updated annually, I have no idea why I continue to come up with a 1998 edition. I currently use this edition (bought it two years ago) and am constantly running into areas where the pace of progress has left the mapbook useless and indeed dangerous in some cases. The 2000 edition is on store shelves now as Rand McNally now publishes the Thomas Guide.As a service to its customers, Amazon must begin identifying where they are selling obsolete material. I guess some might want such an outdated reference for nostalgic reason but for those trying to find their way around the ""center of the universe"" you'll do best getting a guide published in the same century!"
4,Almond soap,I like this product a lot!This is the first time I get it on Amazon and I like the convenience.
4,Great almond hand soap,I love this almond hand soap and suggest it for refilling your dispensers. The smell is a very pleasant sweet almond. I would have rated this item a 5 but the pump is horrible and doesn't work well. You will need to unscrew it and pour.
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!,"This is one of the best romances I have ever read -- the writing is so good that I understood what it felt like to be Amish, almost even wanted to be Amish! And Jacob is so sexy.. there's a great second romance. Lots of funny lines too. This is a keeper!!"
4,Dependable for years,"I am extremely pleased with the way this watch has performed for the past few years I have owned it. I bought it at a store a few years ago looking for a durable (tough) watch to wear to the gym and jobsites. I dont really utilize all the functions it does have. I paid a lot more for this watch when I bought it, and still am happy with it. If looking to spend a little more for a g-shock, I might go for one made with titanium to offset the weight."
5,Great Watch!,"My fourth ""G"" Shock, and the second one of the same exact model. Excellent watch, with lots of good features. Easy to use, reliable, accurate.Great price and service from Amazon."
2,Disappointed,Didn't meet my needs for repeating countdown timer for my exercise program. I spent more than I usually do for an exercise watch and was very disappointed. I replaced it with a less expensive Casio. I was pleased with Amazon's return procedure. I learned to be more penetrating on tech details for future watch purchases.
2,bored,"Beautiful lawyer is outraged that her successful father & businessman Hero accused her BF of blackmailing Hero's sister. Getting confirmation of her BF's schemes doesn't bother her as much as the thought of Hero being romantically involved with her younger sister. Hero, on the other hand, thinks that heroine's sadness is due to her still being in love with her ex-BF.I got through this Mortimer book but just barely. I was bored by it. The romance, writing, dialogue, sexual chemistry, & emotional involvement were tepid. About half of the story was spent on heroine's feelings for her fiancé & her r/s with him. That distracted from the main romance. It also made heroine's love for Hero not so believable & made her look emotionally fickle.Boring read."
4,A fast easy and fun game.,"If you like clue, but you think it takes a little too long then you will like this game. It is fast to learn and fast to play."
3,"fair, but not great","THe premise is good..........which is to group words together that sort of belong together, as those used in shopping and those used in traveling, etc..........not great, but not bad..........good for the flash cards instead, I think.........."
2,Nothing special,"There are plenty of phrasebooks out there that are just as good as this, though they may have fewer entries (Fodor's). The book starts right off with the wrong pronunciation for the letter o in it's pronunciation section. The grammar section at the end has no translations at all. For a beginner the arbitrary symbols and graphics in the grammar secion would be totally confusing. There are no conjugations and no noun plural forms at all. Of course many words have multiple meanings, and these are often left out, depending on the section of the book. Plenty of quantity here and organized well, but too many negatives to recommend purchasing the book."
2,Big mistake,"This book was a big mistake. While the book has some nice features, there is no index of English words, only German words -- which makes looking up specific translations and usages of English words very difficult and time consuming. I would not recommend it for this reason."
5,The World's most efficient Book for learning German,"It is very useful! You can learn many useful German vocabularies From this book. The very merit of this book is that you can learn German vocabularies by Thematic Approach, as the title goes."
1,What a drip!,"I bought this Le Creuset small teapot because I wanted something short enough to fit in my Sharp microwave drawer. The Le Creuset certainly does that. However, the teapot is poorly designed in that it is impossible to pour from the spout without tea dripping out from the top opening in the pot. Additionally, the tea does not come out of the spout in a smooth stream - it flows in spurts. Finally, Le Creuset claims the pot holds 22 ounces. It only holds that much if you fill it to the very brim, in which case you can't put the lid on without water overflowing, much less insert the strainer. I wish I hadn't bought this item."
3,Average teapot. Expensive for what it is. Don't like the infuser.,"I ended up with a Beehouse teapot, and I love it. See title for review."
2,Was hoping it would be better,"I bought every type of pacifier at Babiesrus to see which my son would like, I really liked how these pacifiers looked. However at 0 months is teething element really needed? This is one of my sons least favourite pacifier, I'm not sure what he doesn't like about it, but he really hates it. It's a shame because I like the consept but it just wasn't for us."
4,Great Camera,"My first digital camera, but I love it! It's super easy to use and you can easily get your pictures on to your computer. The software it comes with is completely useless and poorly designed, but you don't need it for anything. A great product!"
2,Frustrating Little Bugger!,"This camera is tempermental as all heck! Have had good and bad shots, more bad than good! Pic after pic is blurry and now I have a ""card error"" message that won't go away even after purchasing a new memory card! Anyone know how to troubleshoot?"
3,Decent camera for the money,"This is a decent, cheap camera that's getting cheaper -- I think I paid about $150 for it, and I see Amazon has it for under $100 now. It takes good pictures indoors and out, although the flash has a harsh quality that makes indoor portraits unattractive. For outdoor fill, the flash works great. Movie mode works well, but without sound, is kind of useless. The controls are all very easy to use, battery life is good, and the sliding lens cover is a good feature. The camera is lightweight and easy to carry along, but is a bit too bulky for a pants pocket. The case is a combination of plastic and metal (aluminum I think) that feels a bit flimsy but has held up OK in the two years I've had mine."
1,Not Worth the Gamble,"With so many cameras out there manufactured by companies with GOOD customer relations why take a chance on a Fuji unless it was free. I have 4 other digital cameras that I have purchased over the last 7 years (Kodak, Canon, Nikon) and have never had a problem. This FUJI is junk. I had the card error problem and the blurry picture problem. The camera will not focus at any distance and Oh Yeah! just after the warranty expired."
4,great camera,"I purchased this camera yesterday. It is easy to use, takes great pics, color is exceptional. My son has a Cannon sureshot and in my opinion this Fuji has great color. I'm so pleased with the purchase of this camera. I'm still learning but I must say my decision to purchase this camera was based on the photos I reviewed on customer images. I'm not sorry I chose this little camera."
1,HORRIBLE CAMERA--DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"this is the WORST, most CRAPPY camera ever known to man! the pictures come out horrible and blurry, the videos replay no sound on camera, and you have to save the pics.so that means if u got a great pic and u 4got 2 save it b4 u turned it off, it'll go away forever. i would MUCH rather buy/reccomend a kodak easyshare, knowing i just got thatand it is so much better-the pictures are so much better looking and have much better quality, the videos play back sound and can go on forever (depending on the memory card,) and it is much cooler. so buy a kodak easyshare, do NOT buy this."
2,Same old stuff...,"I had never read a Lucy Monroe book before. I bought 3 of them at once based on the good reviews they got. I read 'The Real Deal' and really enjoyed it so I immediately started in on 'And Able.' Am I the only one that noticed carbon copy scenes and dialogue from her previous book??? A lot of authors use a formula for their books, I just don't remember one that uses almost word for word lines of dialogue and identical scenes in 2 different books. I had an order for a 4th Lucy Monroe book but have canceled it because it would be more of the same old stuff that I've already read."
3,Not very impressed!,"Even though I skipped Willing, I did read and loved her first book in the series- Ready. It had a decent plot with a good romance but this one just fell flat even before it started. The suspense/action part of the book was very dull and uneventful. Even their love story seemed like the same you would read in any other Lucy Monroe book. One thing I which I've found very annoying in some of her previous books too, including Harlequin, has been that even though the hero obviously likes the heroine, she blatantly says that her only reason for saying no is because he doesn't say he loves her (as if literally saying that everything will be fine as soon as you say the three words!) and then they argue about this for half the book and have sex in the other half! I like tenderness, poignancy and even gut wrenching emotions in my romance which I find seriously lacking in Lucy Monroe's books. Long story short, it was a decent read but nothing exciting or very moving."
5,"Another ""killer"" book!","Just like the first two books in these Mercenaries Series, and Able is a great entertaining read. Lucy Monroe is a great storyteller and in this, the last book in the series she did a great job connecting all the characters from the previous two. Claire and Brett, better known as ""Hotwire"" (and he is HOT all right!) have all the thrills that comes when you fall in love, but with the addition of the adrenaline rush that comes with the territory when you are solving a mystery or a crime. Lucy weaves an interesting action/suspense/romance thriller. Her characters have spunk and tenderness, I know it sounds like an odd combination, but when writing romance she is great at matching strong possessive alpha males with strong, stubborn loving heroines. This is a great series that sadly comes to an end, but I heard that there is a ""spin-off"" series coming! I can't wait for her next book. Her stories just keep you turning pages, its addictive! Great job Lucy, keep the good books coming!"
5,"quick read, fun characters!","Jessie is temporarily caring for her baby nephew when she gets evicted from her apartment.

1,bad purchase,This clock came with no instructions. Have had it for a year and still don't know how to work it.I think it was used. Will pay better attention next time I order something!
1,"Cute, not practical","Like the others have said, you will be constantly reprograming it. You touch any button and it messes up the setting. My mother in law got this for my son when he started school. I was always yelling at him for being late and not getting up with the alarm clock but it was the alarm clock that was not working. The display inticates that the alarm is set but it won't go off consistantly every day. I will keep it as a clock but need something else for an alarm."
1,Very poor quaility (junk) I would rate 0 stars if possible,"Imposible for a 6 year old to operate! To many buttons and if you press the wrong one it changes everything and you have to start all over! JUNK and this was my last attempt to buy a Disney product! Sound quality is very poor, and to difficult to operate!!!"
1,"Cute clock, but *terrible* usability","My mother-in-law bought this for my 5-year-old son for Christmas. It's a nice looking clock and sounds decent. However, it is virtually unusable. It has, I think, 7 cones on it for control buttons. However, you have to use exactly two of them to set the time, the alarm time, the alarm on/off and the date. I'm an engineer and it takes me time to figure out how to do it. There's no way my 5-year-old can. And for him, he'll just hit the cones and change something and then you have to reset everything.Also, with the radio, it's not AM, only FM, despite the description. And there are no presets or even an indicator of what channel you're on. All you have is a Scan button. Hope you don't miss the channel you were looking for.This is just a very poorly designed clock. It looks nice, but I can't imagine they let anyone try to use it before they put it in mass production."
2,save your money,"We bought this for our 5 yr old when he started school. Everytime ANY of the cones are moved it messes one of the settings. This alarm clock is cute, but not worth the hassles of having to reset the time and alarm every day.We kept it just for the radio, otherwise it would be in the trash."
1,Looks nice but doesn't work well!,"I bought this clock for my son for his 6th birthday in July and have been very disappointed with it. It's very hard to set even for an adult (and I'm pretty technology proficient). My son can't set it at all. And as the other review says, if you hit any of the cones, it messes up the clock, even if you are just trying to snooze it or turn on/off the alarm. We also can't get the radio to come in very well and you can only seek in one direction to set the radio so if you want a particular station and miss it, you have to go all the way around again. Right now I'm on-line looking for a new clock for my son as a holiday present. This may stay on his dresser as it looks cool but it will be unplugged."
1,"don't get it to use, get it to look at","We got this for our 6 year old, for his birthday. What a mistake. We can't get the hourly alarm talking mode to stop going off. the time won't stay set. What a waste of money. This is on the dresser, sitting with the wrong time - or something it just reads 5:48 all the time. Total waste of money. I should unplug the thing and just let it collect dust."
1,Looks nice; impossible to use,"My mother-in-law bought this for my 5-year-old son for Christmas. It's a nice looking clock and sounds decent. However, it is virtually unusable.

It looks nice, but I can't imagine they let anyone try to use it before they put it in mass production."
2,Only Great Looking.,"My wife bought this alarm clock for our 4 year son when he was in the Lightning McQueen ""Cars"" stage. It is great to look at. The sounds it makes do replicate the ones made in the movie. That's the best I can say about this clock...I have to echo ""AVK"" that said it is poorly designed. Every time I deal with it I want to throw it in the garbage. We need to keep the manual underneath it because the keys to use it are not intuitive. If someone touches something you need to figure out what they did and try to undo it. There is no ""sleep"" program on this, you can never tell what station it is on, and setting an alarm is unduly complex. We'll be finding something else soon.My background is that I have a Master's in Computer Science and my wife has a Engineering degree and we need to read the manual every time. I do like tinkering with computers and whatnot but not my son's alarm clock right before going to bed when he has stayed up too long already."
1,Horribly Thought Out Children's Clock,"I have to agree with the above folks. This clock is near impossible for myself to work, much less my 8 yo. It looks cute, but that's about it. The cone's are way too sensitive, they make no sense as how to work (you can only figure it out by trial and error).If I could do this over, I would not purchase this clock."
1,This is bland claptrap,Please dont waste your dime or time reading this trash. It seems anyone can get published nowadays. This is a sophmoric attempt by an untalented hack to write quasi-porn. Rife with cliches and luke warm imagery I am sad that I spent the 2 hours to read this pulp.
5,Very tasty!,"I am really a huge advocate of cooking from scratch, with all fresh ingredients, but I really love these seasoning packets especially the one for pork.This has not only nice flavors, but a bit of thickening. I use it whenever I make split pea soup (one packet of this per 1lb bag of peas and only use half the amount of water they say to use on the bag of peas...beautiful, thick split pea soup every time!) or a pot of beans with ham shanks and it always comes out beautifully flavored. I don't add salt when I use this but other herbs can be used, of course, with fantastic results.This comes in several other flavors now, but this is the one that I use the most. Just store the packets in airtight containers, such as Lock & Lock, and they keep practically forever."
2,Could they use more salt?,"Great shortcut for throwing something together, unfortunatly 75 GRAMS of high sodium salt at 31 percent! In order for the beef packet to work and the saltyness to dissapate one must use a lot of potato's in the ingedients."
3,Review,This book was a good read. It was full of wisdom and various life lessons. Paulo Coelho is a great author.
2,Too preachy,"This book depicts the spiritual journey of Brida, who wishes to learn magic. She chooses one of two paths, the Tradition of the Sun or Moon to lead her to her great awakening. The learns and finds her Soul Mate and through sex she is able to become one with the earth, or something like that. This book is just a philosophy lecture thinly disguised as a novel. Unlike The Alchemist, which I liked because of its fable-like storytelling, I found this book to be dull, with one long lecture about the mysteries of the universe after another. The outcome of Brida's journey was left incredibly vague, leaving me with the feeling of not understand what just happened there. There were some interesting parts, like when Brida delves into a past life, and that part redeemed the book a little. But on the whole I wouldn't recommend it unless you really like being preached at for 200 pages."
1,"Its Hell, without a Milton to write about it.","I have never read anything so vulgar and so stupid. Oscar Wilde Said that all the bad literature is done with good intentions. I have no doubt about this being bad literature. But i am not so sure about the good intentions of its author. Making money seems its ultimate objective. And by the lack of quality (i'm being nice) of this book, im sure he will succed. Dont buy it."
2,Below Expectations,"I began this novel expecting something that would leave me with a new perspective on life and love, but it fell below my expectations. There were some points that were worth noting, such as the idea that loving another is allowing them freedom to make mistakes, but at the same time I felt the novel jumped from one idea to another and did not thoroughly emphasize any of the main ideas."
4,Wicca pedia,"I quick and easy read, with some interesting insights, but it did not draw me in deeply. It bogs down occasionally in all the Wicca information, hence the wiccapedia joke. The characters did not draw me in like ""The Witch of Portobello"". Some interesting spiritual insights were presented, in particular in relation to love and rejection. Overall I liked it less that ""The Alchemist"" which I liked less than ""The Witch of Portobello"", but it was an enjoyable read, and I'm glad I read it.Entertainment: 4 starsEnlightenment: 4 stars"
3,Disappointed,"Out of all of Coelho's works, I found this one the most disappointing. The love themes were interesting, but somehow I was left flat. There wasn't the depth that his other books have and I didn't take to the rituals well. Maybe it is just my taste in these matters, but they(the rituals) seemed to lack the quality that I would have hoped for nor did I feel that they held the significance that they could have. He is one of my favourite authors, but I would not start with this book.Dr. Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
4,Beautifully Simple,"The fact that it presents something so complicated as love with such a simple explanation as wizardry, makes a person who is not able to read between the lines,think of it as a uninteresting book. I loved the way the book calls to the feelings of each one of the readers to be for or against the beliefs of the character... Read it if you can!"
2,Not His Best Work,"Coelho is one of my all-time favorite authors, and while I could respect the the themes woven in the subtext of the plot, as well as the usual, excellent writing, I wasn't as thrilled reading this book compared to the others (Veronica Decides to Die, By the River Piedra..., Alchemist). If you're a new reader of his work, I'd start there and skip this one."
3,A brazilian in Japan,"I read this book in its brazilian portuguese version and seems to me there is something about it extremely related to our momentum - the human journey, I mean. It is absolutely an easy litterature, like those you can carry while in the toilette. It is also full of magic, senseless things that drive us ot of reality in a soft fiction. It is cheap, you don't need a dictionary and is better than most TV programs."
1,Stream of consciousness?,I read this book based on a recommendation from a friend. It was horribly boring and pointless and repetitive...almost as if Paulo Coelho wrote a stream of consciousness using free association. I forced myself to finish it hoping the random elements that were introduced and constantly repeated throughout would tie together in the end. Instead it just ended. Thank goodness for small miracles!
2,Disappointing and uninspired -,"A big fan of Coelho's, I came to Brida with high expectations. Compared to his other books, I was expecting something engaging, moving and metapohrical. This book was predictable, slow, and quite uninteresting. It felt as though he was trying hard to get across a personal philosophy and in so doing, forgot to employ his usual engaging and lyrical writing. It felt contrived, literal and obvious. Frankly, I never finished the book and didn't (still don't) feel like I missed something or was left hanging.In part, it could have been the narrator (I purchased the book on CD) whose voice and interpretation was rather uninspired. That said, there was little about the character of Brida that made me want to know her story or care about what was happening to her.If, like me, you want to read/listen to all the books of a favourite author, consider borrowing from the library instead -"
1,Brida a colossal bore,"I have read about a half dozen of Paulo Coelho's books in both Englishand Spanish (mostly Spanish). But Brida (which I read in Spanish) is oneof the most boring books I have ever read in any language.The characters are hollow, the ""philosophy"" trite and repetitive, thewriting undistinguished at best, and the entire work overwhelminglydull. I literally had to force myself to finish it.Brida is one book I couldn't wait to put down."
5,Fox in a Box,Enjoyed all the movies in the set as I'm a big Pam Grier fan. Didn't take long to receive after ordering. Great service!
4,Mahler's view of Beethoven,"Mahler's revisions and additions are less obtrusive than one might expect, clarifying Beethoven's intentions as he saw them rather than ""correcting"" or ""interpreting"" them. Highly recommended as a second Ninth. My favorite is the first Weingartner recording, even though it's a 1926 recording and sung in English."
1,UGH!!!!,"I really think Seann william Scott is funny, but from one Sean to another Seann (BTW, WTF with the two ""n"" thing?), this was painful!! Bro., c'mon..........soooo bad.. no momentum.I'm sitting on my favorite chair, and i just couldn't get comfortable. then i realized it wasn't the chair it was the movie! please do not rent. i have never ever made a review in my life, but felt if i didn't on this one, i would be in violation of the good samaritan law."
4,"The all singing, all dancing...","Fight Club is Chuck Palahniuk's first novel, and I still think it is his best. It is difficult to discuss the book since the movie has become so famous. I saw the movie first and, although I thought it was flawed, it was still a remarkable piece of filmmaking - especially the first half. Everything that was great about the film came directly from the book.I imagine a lot of people take Fight Club as their bible. I don't think that even Palahniuk feels that way. Tyler Durden doesn't really have a consistent philosophy to live one's life; if we needed to hunt elk through Rockefeller Center, that would be just as stifling as having to work in an office for a living.What makes Fight Club a great novel is that it taps into something we have all felt. Modern society has made everything corporate. Authentic experience is getting harder and harder to come by. We lose our soul working jobs we hate to earn money to buy things that we don't need."
4,"Another Case of ""I Wish I Read It Before Watching It""","I'm a latecomer to the Palahniuk experience. I also saw the movie before reading the book. What a shame, because the book is just so much better in every possible way. Fincher got the mood, but what about that awful ending in the movie? The novel gets its right 100%; there is no other way for the book to end; it is, after all, a nihilist work.The only minus I have against Palahniuk's writing is that it's just a bit too repetitive at times. He reminds me of George Saunders in a way -- he's another author I can't read for too long. The prose gets into an automatic rhythm that's just too much to take in one sitting. Spread out in a couple of weeks, the underlying brilliance of their works overcomes their strong styles.That's a tiny minus, though. It's a rare thing that a really different book comes out. Kudos to Palahniuk for managing to do something fresh even in this day and age."
4,It's all because of Marla,"I've felt like the guy in this book--so dead to the world that it's better to feel pain than not to feel anything at all, desperate for contact with something real that's not being sold to me by the slick marketing campaign of some multi-national corporation that refers to me as a ""consumer"", alienated by hypocritical baby-boomer values. It's more obvious in the book than in the movie version that the whole thing about monkeywrenching the consumer culture was Marla's idea. And a danm good idea too. I can't believe anybody had the nerve to make a film about this inflammatory concept. The censors are all worried about copycat fight clubs, but how about copycat culture jamming?"
5,A brilliant book honored by the movie,"I've seen Fight Club-the movie and immediately got hold of the book. I have to say, good as the book is, Fincher does more than an adequate job of capturing the spirit, the madness, the humor and has even added a kinetic energy that compliments the book in every way. It's one of the best realizations of a book's theme I've ever encountered. Then there's the ending... I loved how Mr Palahniuk left that dark and open-ended in the book, and that's why his novel will serve as the ultimate nihilistic statement. Chilling."
2,A confidence booster for aspiring writers,"The book is a good one for aspiring writers since it shows how little talent is truly required to be successful. I was reminded while reading it of ""Less Than Zero"" by Brett Ellis, another version of nihilistic and ultimately worthless fiction. No good will come of this book except to the writer, the publisher and the owner of the movie rights. The book and movie are sure to influence society to be an even more unpleasant place. Just what we needed, another blockbuster story about nihilistic terror."
4,The right book at the right time.,"MischiefMayhemSoapThe tagline of the movie pretty much says it all. Fight Club came alone at the perfect time for me. I was cursed with a very picky taste for literature, and Fight club fit my Palette almost perfectly. Among the themes of Fight Club my favorite I think is the loss of signifigance among the Blue-Collar American male. My Father was one and several important men in my life are, so that aspect of the book spoke to me personally more than any other. ""We have no great War."" tyler Says. ""No great depression.""Our great War is a spiritual War, our great depression, is our lives.""If you take the plunge into this book, do so with an open mind. Its funny, Its Dark, its Crazy, but unless you read it with an open mind, you will get nothing out of it. I end this review with a quote.""I want you to hit me as hard as you can."""
5,similar to the movie... but a lot more twisted,"I was already a major addict to the movie, but I finally got to read the book. It had many similarities to the movie, though the movie added some parts which were absent in the book, and the book had a few parts that were absent in the movie.The book, Fight Club, was a very easy read for me (I read it in one night), and it actually made the movie make some more sense, though I quote it like one quotes the Bible, and the descriptions of many of the evnts were explained a lot more graphically than they were portrayed in the movie, and of course, the ending to the book was a surprise, to say the least, and I recommend this book just as much as I do the movie. Chuck Palahniuk is a great author, and Fight Club is one of the most important books to be released in the last decade. Its views of corporate society, and individualism are absolutely amazing and philosophical, almost the way Nietzsche's philosophy is."
5,"""I Want You To Hit Me As Hard As You Can""","I'll keep this short. If you love the film, you will love the book."
3,"One of the best movies around, but...","this is the book. I didn't like the book when I read it, and listening to it dosen't make it any better!The best Chuck Palahniuk is 'Invisable Monsters'.Read it!"
5,Must have,"If you love the movie that was robbed at the acadmey awards get it on DVD, VHS, and on book . The dialoge is awesome and you can learn so much from it. This book can change your life. It sure changed mine.""His name was Robert Paulson"""
1,Enjoy the movie... don't bother with the book.,"Honestly, I'm one of those, ""the book is always better than the movie,"" type of people. This 'book' was so thoroughly disappointing I'm going to the effort of putting my opinion into words here.For the most part this read is nothing more than an incomplete thought. The writing style is simple. I recall an excessive number of typographical errors that simply should have been caught prior to print.If I've missed the mark, then I'm dense, if not then I'm obtuse, but this work could have come from your average, reasonably well educated, fourteen year old. I must give the writer credit for inspiring a similar story, told better, with the same name.Thoughts on keywords: incomplete, juvenile, shallow, angst, directionless, disappointing"
5,Excellent!,"Palahniuk has a unique style of writing. He has a way of jumping right into the plot, and most of the time, your not fully aware of space, time or characters, but that's what makes this book so intriguing and different. As you read along, things become clearer;...a dark, innovating, ""action-punched"" book!"
2,A bit to simple...,"Now, don't get me wrong. The idea of Fight Club is an interesting one. But the idea is the only thing which kept me from giving this novel a sone star rating. The writing just isn't very good. Everything is written in short, choppy sentences and it all seems so simple. Ack...the violence and sex in this book honestly didn't bother me very much, although I can see how it could bother OTHER people. All in all, violence is the tool of a simplistic author...it can be used with great skill and come off with great impact...or just come off...violent."
5,One of the Elite,"Quite simply, this is one of the best books I have ever read. Aside from the message, the audience it speaks too (and audience that includes me), and all the other political stuff involved, it's just a great story, and Chuck is a great storyteller. Do youself a favor and read this book"
4,What psychotic friend will you produce?,"Cool book. Makes me think of a ""what if?"" scenario in America.American culture is bases on greed.All of our jobs are based on greed.All of our jobs are the antithesis of love.I wonder what psychotic friends Americans wouldproduce if they became sane for just a little while."
2,The movie is better,"I read this book to see how it compares with the movie it spawned. The movie wins. Unfortunately, Palahniuk's writing style is stream-of-consciousness not done well. If I hadn't already seen the movie, I would have had a difficult time keeping up with what was going on in the book.Basically, this feels more like a book that is trying to hard to be stylish and cutting edge.I can only suggest this book as a counterpart piece to the movie AFTER you've watched the movie."
3,"Decent, didn't love or hate it","So, I did the opposite of what people always say to do, but what many do anyway, I saw the movie, then read the book. I enjoyed the movie, I'd give it a solid B, maybe B-. But the book, well, I'd have to give it a C. It was a little harder to get through, and suprisingly, there was a homosexual undertone between the two men that I picked up, but some classmates did not. I did like certain parts of the book better than the movie, but still prefer the movie, sorry. It was a good read though, but there are better ones out there..."
5,A captivating first novel.,This book was strange but stangely believable. A grim comment on today's bored society and it's willingness to push expierence to extremes. The plot twist completely caught me by surprise but gave the book the final direction it needed. Soon to be a movie from David Fincher. How will the screenplay handle the twist?
2,Big disappointment,"Fight Club, by Chuck Palahniuk, disappoints. Readers rarely enjoy movie adaptations over their literary counterparts, but I would be shocked to meet someone who enjoys the book more than the movie. Fight Club is not a book. It is a screenplay. Palahniuk over uses commas. The commas prohibit the reader from ever establishing a coherent flow to enjoy the book. Nothing annoys me more than fragments and poor grammar.I had such high hopes for this book. Fight Club, the movie ranks as one of my all time favorites. The book disappoints on every level except on a few insightful observations of the society we live in. However, don't expect these insights to be eye-opening revelations. Chuck manhandles them in such a crude and shallow manner that it undermines any brutish charm it may have had."
5,.,The First rule of FIGHT CLUB IS You do not talk about FIGHT CLUB.The Second rule of FIGHT CLUB IS You do not talk about FIGHT CLUB.
3,"Greatest Book Ever, but J. Tom Adams Reading?","I love the movie, i love the book, i love fight club. And yes, women can like this stuff too. Because i am a woman and i love this movie, book, and then came the audio book, i though hey- i neeeeed to get this too. It is still a fabulos book, but j. Tod Adems can not read! He is a horrible actor, he lacks emotion, it's like listening to a boring, blah blah blah!I think it wouldhave been sweet if they had chuck palahniuk reaing, or edward norton.Todd Adams took a masterpeice and turned it into blah!"
5,A book for guys who like books...,"Anarchy from a satirical perspective...brilliant use of language, absolutely brilliant. I, myself, have read it twice through and find it unneccessary to keep my place...(ask me why)...Because I can never put it down. Chuck, I'm waiting to see what else you've got up your sleeve...Oh, and if you've got the time, folks, check out the movie...directed by David Fincher...c'mon, how bad can that be?"
3,Visceral,"Visceral, moving, touching. Humor like this can only exist next to violence like this. Well written descriptions and much thought. Unless you count that ending. Chuck! Where'd you leave the ending for this book??? Look under the couch or in the glove box, its got to be around the house somewhere."
5,Astonishing!,"If you want to learn how a really good writer handles a story about diminished expectations for a whole generation of young American males, you need to read this book! Nothing dull or dry here. Your hair will stand on end as the first person POV story unfolds. You can fully understand the angst that drives these young men to desperate measures. They are trapped in a world that does not value them. So, for them, the best defense against existence in a mundane world is a good offense. Unfortunately, real world events have intervened since this book was written and made terrorist activities of any kind hard to justify (even satirically). This book is an adventure into actions that wind up going terribly wrong."
3,See The Movie,"I can't remember saying this about any other work, but the movie is better than the book. The book has some great lines, but all those lines are delivered perfectly in the movie, and in more compelling situations. The folks who worked on the movie did an outstanding job, developing what is a slightly sketchy work into something much more complete and polished.Silence of the Lambs? Great movie, a landmark. But an even better book.Little Big Man? Another great movie, and yet, a way, way better book that will even make you feel betrayed by the movie!Fight Club? Great movie, sign of the times. Passable book."
2,"Good, but highly, HIGHLY overrated.","There were elements that I liked about ""Fight Club"", both the book and the film. The film was stylisticly beautiful and the book was more philosophicaly insightful, but if only the sparks of light in the book and film had somehow come together. I liked the idea of exploring masculinity and femininity and ""feminisation"" (and especially the gay/homoerotic subtext that was cleverly and subtly touched upon in the film), but I don't see the connection between THAT and ""project mayhem"" and anarchy. It went from something that started off as a witty and insitefull look at men and feminism, to something that made very little sense at all."
4,Fight Club,I really enjoyed this book even though I saw the movie first. I would recomend this book to anyone who has ever felt that things weren't what they thought they were. You really should read the book first because there are differences. The world of Tyler Durden is full of intrege and intellegent thought. What he helps the men realize is that they are not special and that they are not what society wants them to be. If you have ever felt trapped by the consumerism that the world pushes on you just lash out and quit buying all that garbage. You really start to feel the same way Tyler feels towards the rest of the world. This is an emotionally charged ride with many ups and downs. I really recommend this book to all and will read it many more times in the future.
3,Perhaps...,"the movie ruined the book for me. Perhaps, but not neccessarily.Of course, take the fact that Edward Norton read the book to me (I could not keep his narrations out of my head). And I couldn't picture the characters any other way than the way they were portrayed in the film.Perhaps I should have read the book first, but I think I would have still been disappointed with the ending, being that it varies quite differently from the movie.I was pleased with the way the movie takes a lot of the narrator word for word. I was displeased with some of the scenes left out and changed.Overall, a great read if you haven't seen the movie."
3,Only an American,"Palahniuk must be ecstatic! Now there's an Iraq War where all the disaffected young American men he writes about can go (...). Only an American can write this - the disaffection, the disdain and cynicism towards their own soft affluent lives in a culture that is the envy of the starving Third World majority, existential angst of men with everything but the imagination to make life meaningful for themselves and the rest of the world - yuppies approximating spiritual hunger, yuppies suffering ennui -not to worry. After Iraq, there's North Korea. Syria. Wow. Nothing like Osama and Saddam to cure the postmodernist blahs."
2,"Except for the ending, not much different from the movie.","This review is only for people who saw the movie and are wondering if they should read the book. I saw the movie and was completely blown away. I then read the book and found it was almost exactly the same as the movie, save for a different ending. If I hadn't seen the movie first I probably would give the book 4 stars."
1,"Book photo pictured, not book received","I purchased this book for my husband. He specificly asked for the ""Fight Club' book with the pierced lip. Not a big deal, but the book I requested had additional chapters that were wriiten about the movie. The book I received was a reprint of the original. Picture of book does not match the book you receive"
4,"A work of exceptional skill, which I will never read again.","Fight Club is visceral, surreal, and very well-written. If you've seen the movie, you've practically read the book, as they're almost identical, right down to the grim, off-center narration by the main character. My reaction to both book and film are also nearly identical: They are both works of mind-blowing originality and fantastic execution and I did not enjoy either of them much at all. They were both worth the time, don't get me wrong, but I would be lying if I said that I actually enjoyed either of them. Such is life."
3,A rare occurence!,"Don't get me wrong the book is great, but I was disappointed with it for one reason.Whoever did the screenplay for the movie did one hell of a job because the Movie is better than the book! I don't know why, but I like the movie a lot better than the book. Maybe it is because I have seen the movie several times before I read the book.It is a good book and worth reading to see if you agree with me or not!"
3,Not as good as the movie,"I love Chuck's books but will admit that although fight club is one of my all time favorite movies, the book is not even in my top 5 books taht Palahniuk has written. Maybe it was the movie the ruined the book for me and had I read the book first I would have had a different opinion, but I just didn't feel the book to be nearly as interesting or well put together. All that said, still a very interesting book and worth the read."
5,Don't Put this book down....,"A thiller, action packed to the end. If you have ever seen the movie this book is ten times better than it. Very easy to read and very easy to follow."
4,Good fun,"A lot of fun, worth reading even if you have seen the movie many times. There are some parallels which would have been too complicated to transfer to the movie, but they make wonderful sense in the book."
4,Very good writing,"I haven't seen the movie yet, as this is Australia and movies take months to get here (if at all). But after reading the premise of the movie I decided it would be an interesting story and, based on the fact that the author could allegedly write, decided to read the book. I really liked the book but I must confess I'm one of those who doesn't care for the ending. It works OK, but I felt the authour could have done better somehow. The rest of the book is great and the writing is wonderfully economical yet still remarkably vivid. Just the way I like it! Fight Club is a good, engaging read."
4,amazing begining . . . okay ending. A good read over all.,"First rule of the novel Fight Club is: tell everyone about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is: tell more people about this novel. I know this because Tyler knows this . . . This entire novel, up until the very end, is utterly amazing. Don't let that keep you from picking this book up, though. The end isn't bad, it just dosen't measure up to the rest of the book."
5,It is awesome,Chuck writes deeper than I can think. Its a book that should not be read if the person is mentally unbalanced.
5,"In the end, we're all fighting for our lives.","If all stories were this good, reading would be the only leisure activity people would participate in. Undoubtedly one of the best collection of characters, plot, suspense, drama, and wit to come along in recent memory."
5,A great book.,This book is one of the best books ive read in a long time. A must have for any collection.
5,the best,"this book is the greatest book i've ever read. if you have not yet seen the movie, read the book first, you will enjoy it more."
5,Masterpiece,"Chucks first book, but arguably his best. Fight Club is entertaining and will keep you reading for many hours. Its around 200 pages, nothing to long, but at the amount to keep you very satisfied. This book is the entree to my reading.Enjoy!"
3,"""A macabre and twisted tale. Compelling but dismal.""","Fight Club (the movie) is a true cult classic. The movie would not have been possible without the book. Chuck Palahniuk weaves a tortured tale about _____ _____? (the narrator) and Tyler Durden. The story is cool and believable. In fact, I have come up with several versions of a Fight Club II in my own mind after reading Palahniuks novels and watching the movie. I'd seen the movie twenty times or more before ever reading the book. It became imperative that I read the book. Between Palahiuk and the screenplay writer, and David Finchers exquisite directing the movie was a masterpiece. The book, however left something to be desired."
2,I didn't get this one,"I started reading Fight Club with high expectations, but never really got to grips with it. I found it amoral, and lacking in humour. It also takes swipes at modern (American) society without suggesting any alternative but a rather primitive response, namely responding with mindless violence, destruction and the creation of mayhem. I give it two stars because Palahniuk can clearly write well, but the whole theme of the book just put me off. And this is not because I particulary dislike books that contain violence and anti-social behaviour- I loved Burgess' brilliant A Clockwork Orange, for instance. I think the absence of humour put me off this book more than anything else."
5,Haiku Review,A Haiku Review of Fight Club by Chuck PalahniukListen Space MonkeyHis Name was Robert PaulsonAnd then there's Tyler...
4,Fight Club,"I thought this book was very profound. It has had an impact on my life. It showed me that life isn't about living without regrets. You have to take chances to live a real life. It is about a man who has insomnia. He meets a girl at one of the group meetings that he goes to for his insomnia. Then, he met a man named Tyler Durden. They went to a bar for a couple of drinks, and when they came out, Tyler told the guy to hit him as hard as he could. They started fighting for no other reason but to let out anger. People saw them fighting so they started fighting for the same reason. That's how fight club started. Later, the fight club turns into something more than that. It becomes Project Mayhem. The purpose of this club was to create chaos to civilization. They caused a lot of damage to the world. Project Mayhem, was spreading. That is the best part of the book. After you read up to this point, it just gets better, and you'll never want to put the book down."
3,Interesting.,"The first half of ""Fight Club"" is interesting and entertaining, but the second half of it ruins the book. Once it gets outside of the fight clubs and into the end-of-the-millenium, blow stuff up type of junk, the book falls apart.Overall, ""Fight Club"" was interesting enough, but I have to admit - and I usually don't say this - the movie was better. David Fincher is amazing. Fincher's direction and Jim Uhls' screenplay add so much more to the book. Get the special DVD of ""Fight Club"" rather than the book. You won't be missing much, yet you'll be gaining so much more."
4,dont compare with movie,"Other reviewers claim ""the book is better"" or ""the movie is better"". I'm here to say you shouldn't compare the two works of art. The movie ISN'T trying to be the book or vis versa. The film is BASED on the book, but offers its own artistic insights and story telling techniques. No movie will contain the same amount of information as the novel it's based on because no viewer would stand watching an 8 hour film. Film is unique, and shouldn't be judged by the book it's based on. The story is somewhat the same, but the two arts tell it in an entirely different way."
4,same great Chuck,"I love Chuck Palahniuk. I think he is brilliant, smart, witty, and, best of all, he speaks the scary truths about humanity that most people would rather bury. His writing style is truely unique and the phrases or words that he repeats are never annoying - he emphasizes them perfectly and is sure to bring up reoccuring themes throughout all of his books. He'll throw a line in from earlier in the novel, a powerful line. And it will bring the book full circle all over again.I did like <u>Survivor</u> and <u>Diary</u> better than <u>Fight Club</u>, but it was still an awesome book. Palahniuk is so great, I promise myself to reread every one of his novels before I die."
4,Wrong edition,"Yeah, yeah, the book is great, but this hardcover edition sucks... if I'm spendind 13 extra bucks on a hardcover editionI'd expect it was good quality paper and finish. This cardboard paper I got had still pages together I had to separate with a knife... Believe me, buy another edition and save 10+ dollars"
5,Food for thought.,"This book is not for the faint of heart... or stomach. It is, however, essential to our generation. We have no great wars, no Great Depression...Our lives are empty, directionless, spiraling out of control, and the only way to get back on track is to let go of everything. This is the lesson this book teaches us.The mentality behind Fight Club is revolutionary and original. The first rule of reading FIGHT CLUB: Open your mind and dive in."
3,not bad,"Fight Club is not a bad book. Palahniuk has a smooth style. Fight Club is easy to read and short, so you don't have to waste too much time on it. David Fincher (Seven) is a stylish, gifted director and Norton (American History X) is a great actor. Fight Club will make a better movie. Watch the movie. Buy the book if you have to, but it would be smarter to go get it out from the library."
4,"Thoughful, engrossing","Like a few of the other reviewers, I did see the movie first. This, of course, made me read much more into the wording of the book than I should have had the right to do. The story itself was well thought out and full of little bits of satire. A club that revolves around beating eachother to a pulp survives on it's sale of soap. And what better way for a group of men raised by the weaker sex to vent frustration than in a no-holds-barred street fight? The book also says a bit about society as a whole, and whether or not being a upper-middle class drone is the most fulfilling way to live life. Is being able to buy the the most expensive dust ruffle for your bed really the way to make you a better person? Is Fight Club one step up or one step down from the evolution process? What's worse, millions of people spending their lives punching numbers or total anarchy? This is a great book, a fast read. It definitely makes you think about what's important."
2,I just don't get it.....,I had never seen the movie pior to starting this novel so I was coming in as a tabula rasa. I was very excited after hearing about how everyone raves about this novel. Wow what a lie! This book has to be one of the most falsely hyped novels I have ever read. This book was very boring and predictable. I honestly don't see why everyone thinks this is some kind of genius novel. I have read other books by this author and this would not be classified as the best one for me. I seriously think it must be some kind of male thing where all the men think it is pure brilliance because of the concept of starting a fight club. Well to that I say big whoop! That is not something innovative and this book was hardly thought provoking. the only thing I will give kudos to the novel for is the hinting towards questioning the fabric of our society and what it constitutes to be human in America and what might possibly happen if someone were to suddenly stop caring so much.
1,Do not buy from this seller,I got a damaged book. Amazon should print this review as I wanted all the. Buyers to know that selling a damaged good is not acceptable. Also Amazon should note that I will report Amazon to Better business bereau if they do not print my review.
1,Save yourself a few hours and rent the movie,"This is one of the few books I've read where I think the movie was actually better than the book. Even then, I don't think it's so much that the movie was BETTER, but the book just works better as a movie. It plays out nicer. The book stayed right on par with the movie and only a few tiny events were changed.If you don't know the premise, fight club is about a guy who shall forever remain nameless. He can't sleep at night, so he goes to support groups for diseases and problems he doesn't have. He meets a woman named Marla Singer and they form a hate-hate relationship. Then the guy meets a man named Tyler and his entire life changes. He goes from a condo filled with IKEA furniture to a crack-house reject of a house.He forms a club called Fight Club with Tyler. Men beat each other up and feel great about it afterwards. Woo.It was a quick read and a poor book. I'd absolutely recommend renting the movie over wasting your time reading the book."
1,Another slick pointless book.,"Are we really supposed to believe that what men need is to destroy the world? Is this the only way that all things ""commercial"" can be gotten away from? Now that this book has become a ""blockbuster"", and the author a ""name"", isn't this exactly what us men are supposed to destroy? How can a book be five stars (or even two) when the internal logic of it is strained so? We won't even talk about the ending. This book is just another peice of trash that has been labelled as smart because it has an idea at its center. Never mind that the idea is stupid and poorly wrought."
4,Great,"While not the best book of all time, definetely worth a purchase. The book is filled with great one liners, and an involving story line. If you haven't yet seen the movie or read the book, I suggest reading the book first... I think the shock is better that way, but even if you have seen the movie, pick this up. It's far better, with a better ending, and the jokes are more developed."
4,Provocative...,"Keeps you wanting to read more, makes you get into the whole fight club rules, gets you excited about the concept, and confuses you with the characters and what the heck is going on...A great book to read (now need to get the movie), a lot of action, never a dull moment, and a lot more action...The fight club joins many professionals and gets them out of their daily frustrations and personal lives into a world with no limits, no brakes, and no rules...Fight club members recognize each other, but the first rule about the fight club is never to talk about the fight club...A very dark, provocative book that leads you to go out and look for the closest fight club near you..."
4,I am Jack's review of this book,"I had read a lot of Palahniuk's work prior to reading Fight Club, which I would imagine is rare, as most people familiarize themselves with him after having seen the movie that is based on this book. I still think it's his best book to date.It is much easier in the book to foresee the 'trick' ending, I think."
2,Stick with the movie,"I was surprised by how badly written and choppy the book was. Usually books are better than the movies, however, that wasn't the case here. The book could have been so much better if he had but more material in it to fill in the gaps. I feel that the movie took the problems with the book and smoothed them out making a much better story."
4,Excellent,"This book is one that you should read if you are interested in the way the mind work, its great, violent at some points, well written and it keeps your attention all the time."
4,surprisingly the movie was better,"Don't get me wrong,it was a good book but this is one of those rare occasions where the movie exceeds the book."
3,Not as good as the movie,"Im a huge palahniuk fan, and I love his books. I usually love most books more than the movie, but us is an exception."
2,"If you liked the movie, you may not like the book","Fight Club the book is similar in style to the movie; strange and enigmatic. The storyline is virtually identical to the movie, which shows how faithfully the movie followed the book. Unfortunately, the book was not very compelling to read and the strangeness became tedious after a while. If you have not seen the movie, the book may be a revelation. However, if you have seen the movie, the characters may appear crudely drawn."
4,Who really is Tyler Durden?,"This book caught me by surprise. The movie set a vivid tone for the audiences but after reading the book, it's like being the narrator in the book. I loved the movie but I wish I would have read the book first. No important details were left out by Palahnuik in the book. The character, Tyler Durden, a savior or a murderer? You, yourself have to decide after reading the book. Palahnuik threw an image about how society and generations really are to my face and beliefs. So...take my word for it, read the book, you won't regret it."
5,Entertaining but don't take it too seriously,"It appears that the negative reviews of this book are from people who consider this book as an actual theory for reforming society. The result of Tyler's goals would obviously result in the horrible death and chaos.However, if you are want to read an entertaining, different, and interesting piece of fiction then this book is great. If your looking for theories on reformation of politics and society, look elsewhere.In addition, this is one of the fews books that actually compliments the movie instead of making the movie look worse."
5,"Quick, really fun read","If you have never seen the movie I highly recommend reading the book first. Both are great but I think I would have appreciated the novel a bit more without having the characters from the movie in my mind. I am a huge fan and would say that this is his best work behind lullaby, which is my personnal favorite."
5,"Deeply Philosophical, Disturbingly Unbalanced","This is a story that is deeply philosophical in nature regarding the events and the introspections of the character, however this mixed with the disturbing psychological ongoings makes for a fantastic read that is interesting, brilliantly articulated philosophy and distrubingly captivating psychosis."
5,Tapping into the mind of a generation.,Chuck Palahniuk writes what was on the tip of all of our tongues...he and Tyler just gave it a name!EXCELLENT!!!
5,The movie is not better,"i love this book, its clever and interesting word choice has made me think about things in a new perspective. I admit i watched the movie before i read the book but after i read the book i was angry at the movie because it goes against the whole idea, i mean come on, two guys that just dont care about anything, lets cast Brad Pitt and Edward norton, isnt that ironic?"
4,"Read it twice, once for you and once for you.",The first time I read Fight Club I thought it was good. The second time I read Fight Club I thought it was excellent. I'm not going to talk about Fight Club because those are the rules.
3,"Good, but not that good.","Some of these reviews are a bit hyperbolic. Thoroughly recommended for a long haul flight, but hardly the best novel ever written."
4,The book is the movie.,"A lot of times people say that the book is better than the movie....in this case, the book IS the movie."
5,great,my brother loves it. We even got the movie. This is one of the few i have actually read. Still have it.
5,A must buy,If you can buy a first edition because this book is a must have and you educated when society swings from side to side.
3,the book is written like the movie is filmed,"Most times, when you read a book, and then see a movie, or vice versa, you come out of the situation saying ""The book is much better than the movie."" Maybe this is because the characters are better developed in the book, or there are moments in the book you really liked that were changed for the movie. But that is not the case here. Sure, there are a couple things changed, but on the whole, the book is written like the movie is filmed, and though it's nice to make our own pictures in our own heads, I think the movie does a better job of ""describing"" the events than the book. The writer's voice is interesting, and it is portrayed accurately in Norton's narration in the movie.Overall, not a waste of time, but if you're on death row, and someone says to you, ""You can either have two days to read the book or 3 hours to watch the movie, and you will die afterward,"" do yourself a favor and choose the movie."
2,"A first, maybe, in novel/film history","What the host site review fails to mention in describing the prose as ""lethally swift"" is what that swiftness is lethal to... which means, essentially, that you can tell Palahniuk wrote sections of the book in bars, clubs, etc. (which he has discussed in interviews) and not in a place where ideas, characters, anything can really be fleshed out to any great length. It's a firecracker of a premise, and the film (which, to be fair, I must admit I saw first, which may present some bias) takes all the best parts of the book and gives them visuals, which Palahniuk's prose fails in most cases to do. The plots differ in some ways. Without the theme, this book review would rate the novel with one star; the ideas about manhood and culture, etc. give it another star. The movie gets five stars. Watch the movie and then read the book, just to get the whole experience."
4,The Interesting Fight Club,"ReviewMy thoughts on the story fight club are that it will start off very confused. You will feel like you don't know what's going on. A chapter will end in one location, and the start of the next chapter will have a totally different place. This story was based on two men who were starting a club because they were angry about many things in their life. They decided to let their anger out in these clubs. The clubs eventually got out of control for even the ones who started fight club. It goes beyond fight club to out side situations in the real world. This book was not too interesting at the beginning. I had my doubts. But as I read on I realized that it was starting to get very fascinating and I enjoyed it very much."
5,A Welcome Enhancement,"I just read the book for the first time. The movie is better organized, but of course the book is richer, more textured. There is not really anything new per se, although there are additional subplots and new scences. The book would be mondo confusing for anyone who has not seen the movie. There were entire scenes I could better appreciate having seen the movie.The book is an easy read, but that does not mean it's easy to follow. The food-service guerrilla terrorism was rather gross, but I appreciated seeing that he blackmailed several businesses into subsidizing Fight Club.All in all, enjoy it!"
4,FIGHT CLUB,"A gripping book about male power issues and society. I'm 30 year old male I sympathize and the sense of 'mid-life crisis' this book creates. Somewhat diffrent than the movie, which I truely love."
5,Because you owe it to yourself.,"The main reason for reading this book...because you owe it to yourself. This is a beautifuly written peice in which the usual unmelodic tone of our culture is conviniantly tossed aside. The narrarator, along with his ""sidekick"", ushers the reader through an examination of his or hers on life. Maybe the books success should be measured in the time spent by the readers as they try to make amends with their own pshycotic minds. And after all, Socrates himself says ""the unexamined life is not worth living."""
3,There's something missing,"It seems to me that with this book Chuck Palahniuk was baking a cake and forget a few ingredients. That is not to say, however, that this novel doesn't taste good, but it's not as tasty as ones from the past. The plot and actions of the characters are interesting and fresh, and the social comentary is poignant. However, the character development is a little weak. The interaction between Tyler and his ""buddy"" doesn't really mean anything because a strong relationship never develops. The ending is also very abrupt. Once the announcement is made (like you didn't already know before) the novel just ends. A second half of the book would half strengthened it a lot; a second half with a battle for control of the body and a stronger relationship between Tyler and ""John's utter despair."" There are a lot of small things that could have been done to transform this book from a good one to a modern classic."
2,Save me from the neo-anarchists,"For the first (and hopefully last) time I have to say ""I liked the movie better than the novel"". The movie was more clever, and the actors made the dialog pop.I wonder about those reviewers who said the book was ""revolutionary"", ""thought provoking"", and ""new"". I direct their attention to any Nihilist scribblings of the last century.Fight Club offers no new insite into human nature, mob mentality, or philosophy/psychology; those that have some self-proclaimed epiphany after reading this book need to get a life and expand their reading horizons.At it's best, Fight Club, is scathingly funny, dark and morbid. At it's worst, it's highly over rated by chest-beating testosterone-driven man-children."
4,Love the movie buy the book,"The book provides a more in depth view of Jack's world and innner struggle with the dominance of Tyler Durden. Enter a world of frustration and apathy, that is soon shattered with bare fists and broken teeth."
4,FIght Club I saw the movie first,"I saw fight club on TV before I even knew it was a book, and when I started reading it I thought knowing the ending would ruin the book. But it was the complete opposite. I liked the book even more because I was able to pick on little details I would have only seen on a re-read. The movie and the book are very similar because it's a short book, so not much had to be cut out.I would highly recommend this book, Chuck Palahniuk has an interesting writing style where he will start with the end of a chapter and then use the rest of the chapter explain how they got there. The other notable thing about Chuck's writing style is the dialogue, and how important quote marks are, people will think something while having a conversation and then move right on to saying something else and its easy to get lost with something someone said and what they thought. Other than that a great quick read that's fascinating."
3,Bentley Little Did It Better,"This novel has definitely parallels with Bentley Little's THE IGNORED. It's sort of the ""action"" version of the Little novel. But FIGHT CLUB's cop-out ending destroys the rest of this excellent novel's credibility. At least Little took his premise to the limit and didn't offer the reader an easy out."
5,A manifesto for life,Just buy it. At least the movie didn't totally mangle this perfect book. The first rule of fight club is: YOU DON'T QUOTE THE MOVIE!
3,I know I might get pelted for this but the movie was better.,"I saw the movie first and I think it is a masterpiece in film. Absolutley everything about it is classic in the way of Goodfellas and Citizen Kane and all those others, to me. Knowing that often times that usually the book is better than the movie I thought that this thing must be a mammoth. Maybe the movie ruined me for the book but i still think that it translates to film better. And some of the events in the book, when done in the film don't seem to make as much sense or don't play out as well. Take for instance how Tyler and Jack (or Joe going by the book) meet. In the book the symbolism of the hand is suitable but a little heavy-handed. If you are in awe of the movie as much as me then the book is a good companion, but something you can just take out from the library or borrow from a friend unless you really really love the movie. Then you should just get the damn book."
1,What a disappointment!,"Perhaps I was expecting too much from this novel after reading all the glowing reviews. Hopefully the movie adaptation will live up to the hype. A few articles made much of the fact that Palahniuk wrote parts of the novel while underneath trucks he was working on. I can believe it. Hopefully, his other novel, Survivor , will be a better read."
1,Boring and incomprehensible,"I wouldn't have finished reading this book if it weren't for the sake of improving my German reading skills (It's the first book I've read in German). Now I regret having read it. It felt like the book ofered me nothing - it was boring, nihilistic for no good reason, lacking any absorbing or convincing story line, just plain stupid. Maybe I should have read it in English and then would have appreciated it more, but I feel the whole Fight Club thing is being oversold."
2,CURIOUS,"Curious how much the philosophy and form of Fight Club reminded me of Andrew MacDonald's ""The Turner Diaries"" (the racist, right wing, terrorist manifesto).Kind of makes you think, doesn't it?"
1,Terrible peice of hypocrisy,"This book and movie are ludicrous. Chuck P. sufferfrom the same disease that hacks like Bret Easton Ellis and his ilk suffer from. He glorifies what he purports to condem. In this case, male violence. The scary thing is that this book and movie are reaching the ignorant, who see only this glorification and miss the terror that lies at the heart of this awful book. Further, the book masquerades as a rebellion against our capitalist and money-drive society, but what did the author do but allow this to be made into a high budget movie, that exists only as a result of the ideas that the book is rebelling against. If you want to see a real literary account of the violent side of man's nature read the masterpiece _Blood Meridian_ by Cormac McCarthy. This is slick trash hipped up for an ignorant reading audience."
1,Big Jocks,"""Fight Club"" is a great book if you are a big jock who likes to flex your muscles all of the time. The plot is about a self-help club with a lot of guys who want to liberate themselves from Swedish furniture by pounding on each other with their fists. ""Fight Club"" is an ad that celebrates physical fitness and looks down on those who don't quite fit a certain fashionable physical profile. And all of this is said in the name of non-conformism. But wait! What's more conformist than the belief that working out in a gym and sweating like a pig makes you a better person? ""Fight Club""'s jock-fascism is jockalicious.There's also a latent homoeroticism in the book. The narrator says that he ""wants Tyler"" and he has a fantasy about Tyler lifting heavy logs. That's fine, except that the book pretends to be ultra-macho hetero.Anyway, it's a great book for jocks, folks!I apologize for my poor writing skills, but English is not my first language."
1,Worst Book I've EVER Read,"I couldn't even bear to finish this book. I kept thinking throughout the book, how was this published? If Mr. Palahniuk had taken out all the fluff he added, the book would have been half the size. It's boring, stupid, the author has an amazing talent to make this book that has a half decent plot, into the worst piece of literature I've ever read."
5,A bible in 208 pages,"This is the BEST book I have ever read, and, believe me, I have read quite a few, from ""The Divine Comedy"" by Dante to ""The Brother's Karamazov"" by Dostoevsky. While the writing may not be the quality found in either of those two books, the paradigm altering concept(s) behind this book are of an unmatched quality. Rarely does excellent writing come together with vivid imagery and dark, twisted, enlightenment -- but in Fight Club, everything comes to a head."
2,I am Jack's inflamed sense of disappointment.,"One of the very few cases in which the movie is actually better than the book. This has actually never happened to me before. I love the movie, but when I read the book I was just disappointed. I think most of the reason is because the writing is just..amatuer, for lack of a better word.If you've already seen movie, don't read the book. It'll just bring you down.I have read other things by Chuck Palahniuk, though, and I liked most of everything else. So please just buy different Palahniuk book."
5,Tiny life,"The first rule of fight club is do not talk about fight club. The Second rule of Fight Club is DO NOT TALK about fight club. An amazing first novel by an author that will be around for awhile. To say the least life changing, it dables in buddism thoughts and giving up all worldly possesions. This book speaks the truth about modern day life and has the dark humor that life now aday offers. If you read but one book in your life time, read fight club"
2,Disappointing,"With all the high reviews I thought this would be a good read. Boy, was I disappointed. It wasn't my cup of tea at all.In my opinion, the writing wasn't good. The author didn't make me want to care about anyone in the story (perhaps his intent); the characters simply were not developed; the story didn't grab me in and I should have quit reading after the first chapter. I feel I wasted my time when I could have been reading something more satisfying.Frankly, I was bored and was looking forward to ""the end."" Perhaps it's a man thing. I just didn't get it."
5,Great book for great price,I bought this book for my son. The book is in excellent condition and the price was very reasonable. I would look here first for any future book needs. Thank you so much!!
3,I would have liked it way better 20 years ago,"I shouldn't have waited until middle-age to read this. I picked it up on the advice of a friend, and I should have loved it. Instead I found it creepy and disturbing. I had the same experience with the Dune movie and with Hunter Thompson's ""Hell's Angels"". Loved them in my teens and early 20's, hated them later. Apparently, some things have a very strict demographic. I don't recommend against this book, just know what you're in for."
5,My absolute favorite - even better than the amazing movie!,"This book is by far my absolute favorite, and has been for years. I've yet to come across something that I've found to be this much of a page turner.One of the very few books I've found myself reading more than once.The only book I've read more than twice.I highly recommend it to anyone who finds the idea interesting.The movie was great, but the book is 100x better."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR,"Although advertised as a ""youth"" hat, this will not fit normal sized kids. We tried to put this on our 9 year old and it didn't fit. We tried our 1st grader, no luck. It fits LITTLE kids, as in pre-k. So buyer beware. This vendor also lists the item with ""free returns."" What that means is anybody's guess. We returned the product and not only did we get charged for postage to get a hat that doesn't fit, but when we returned it we were charged postage again. Free returns my left foot. When I reached out to the vendor, they didn't try to make it right. They just said I'd get a refund and I'd be charged for postage."
2,Kid's hat a so-so product,Hat is one size - not adjustable. Tight fit fir an 8-year old girl. I would recommend looking for an adjustable size hat.
4,"cute, enough heat","It has two levels of heating, I always use the highest one. It also has a button to switch to cool air, actually it is to shut down the heating parts. The size is small, cute but the noise when heating exist not as quiet as instruction says. Another problem is safety, because the whole body is plastic (maybe ABS), when using long time , the plastic mouth part can be very hot, don't let it contact with any material flammable (such as paperwork)."
2,Price sure went up from years ago,"I bought 10 filters from Kaz several years ago. The order blank was in the owner's manual. The price was reasonable. Now you can't find the filter anywhere but Amazon and Kaz upped the price. I already gave up and purchased an ultrasonic humidifier that does not have a filter. I hate it when ""old"" things are made obsolete."
4,"Took forever to get, but was happy with product when recieved","This filter took 3 weeks to get, but it was the correct filter for what I needed. No complaints other than that it took way too long to get."
5,good filter,I bought 3 of these filters for my humidifier online because I could not find them in stores anymore. I'm using the first of the three and it works and fits fine. I would purchase again.
5,Really delicious,"Everything arrived in time, good condition and the qualitty of products was just as I expected. I will totally recomend this product. By the way, different flavors of the product are very good."
4,Better Late Than Never...,"OK. It's now 2004 and the book was published in 1992. I don't usually like detective stories, but somehow got a copy of ""I Left My Heart"" and thoroughly enjoyed it. So much so, that I purchased the next three in the series. ""Crazy for Loving"" didn't disappoint me.Robin finds herself trying to solve a case the police consider closed. Along the way she gets mixed up with two different women, one is on the suspect list and the other is the sister of a suspect. In the meantime, she's working on another unrelated case. I'm not sure why this one was thrown in except as filler, but it didn't really detract from the main story.Good book. I'm looking forward to reading ""Under My Skin"" book 3 in the series."
4,Interesting Read!,"Excellent, excellent book for anyone who is interested in Quenn Elizabeth I or the Elizabethan era. Interesting little tidbits of knowledge about court life, politics and Elizabeth's private life. The pictures are absolutely beautiful and go along so well with the the written text. Definate A+!"
5,Elizabeth I by Watkins,"This work has a wealth of information about Elizabeth I andthe era itself. She is portrayed as an elegant monarch, dressedin silk and other fine clothing. A portrait of Elizabethdepicts her stately appearance as a Tudor. Elizabeth liked tostroll in the area of the Great Hall at Hatfield. A personalastrolobe is depicted-a fine personal item created circa 1560.Her coronation was a stately affair depicted in a personalportrait considered to be priceless today. This work is perfect for historians and others interested in the period of Elizabeth. The full color portraits are valuablein their own right."
1,MARY KATIE AND ASHLEY CRUSH COURSE,I WISH I COULD FIND THIS ITEM SO I PLAY IT AND DO A BETTER REVIEW
5,Wonderful,this game was very interesting and entertaining wonderful for people of all ages the olsen twins are delightful
2,looks good but isn't,"When I got this I was expecting an entertaining, fun game. Trust me,it's not worth the money. At first it's okay, but when you go around the board game one time it gets too repetative. You end up playing the same games over and over again. The games aren't very fun either. Don't fall for the commercial. The game itself doesn't live up to it. I gave it two stars because the concept was kind of fun, but the game didn't live up to it either."
2,This was ok,"I think this game was ok,I played it, and it was sorta fun, but once i did some of it, i got bored with it. I thought it would be like the playstation one. Cheerleading, yearbook- none of that on this one. this one is a board game and u move around it and get points for guessing the right guy. it is sorta fun, but not like i thought. I guess u could buy it, but i would suggest buying the one on playstation!!"
1,A 13-year old gamer,"This Game [is bad]! ...I absoutely hate it ! I love all of their games, EXCEPT this one. Some of the levels are too hard! The only thing I liked about it were the graphics. They were pretty good. But seriously, if you are thinking about getting, rent it first, because you probably won't like it enough... it!!!"
2,Crush Course,Crush course wasnt what i thought it was going to be good because of the commercials. When i got it for xmas i was sooooooo excited i tried it right away and it was so bad. It stunk up. The gamboy game is just a stupid board game. The playstation game is what the commercial is.
1,it stinks,It's way too hard to beat certain leavels (clean up the beach). It gets so hard that it's not fun any more. Don't buy this game. Rent it first and see if you like it. You probably won't!
2,Crush Course,"This game sort of gets boring! After seeing the advertisements it looked really cool but it really isn't all that great. It's the same games over and over, really don't spend the money on this game get one of their other games! Do Not get me wrong I love all their games and stuff but this is just not as good as the rest."
5,A cute calander for anyone who loves cats,"What I liked about this calander. On the days of the month, from January to December, it has a good amount of space to write appointments, events, meetings etc. The calander is very colorful and has lots of pictures of cute kittens. Each of the 12 months, there is is a quote relating to kittens and interesting kitten facts and tips. The calander also gives details on how to enroll a picture of your kitten for the 2003 calander."
5,"If you love kittens, you'll love this!","This is a great calendar for cat and kitten lovers. Every glossy page is filled with cute, furry friends. I'll be buying this calendar every year from now on! I highly recommend!"
5,A Must!,"Generally, books offering an insight to Filipino culture are difficult to come by. This book mixes history and sociology, and, indeed, a bit of comedy and brings it all together. Lots of little stories and anecdotes which help one understand how a corrupt, virtual royal couple ammassed perhaps one of the world's largest fortunes, with the backing of successive American governments. Filled with dark humor and even a bit of sarcasm, this book would actually be humorous if it wasn't based on the story of one of the 20th Century's true tragedies. This is the story of how a rich, fantastically varied and beautiful tropical country, a country populated by a good but largely simple and powerless populace, was plundered by it's ruling family--with Washington's aid--while the world barely took notice.Read it!"
5,Excelent!,"Wonderful authorship, I suppose thats because he's British and therefore a reliable third party with unbiased insight. It never occured to me that my father was born on the right side of the Agno. I always wondered how he got a sinecure in the armed forces, which he was very well found on. Some of the Hamilton-Paterson's conclusions are quite emasculating to many Filipinos especialy to elites, which is nonetheless true as I can tell and am Filipino living in the West. He is very astute in coining crony monopolism instead of crony capitalism. The part about economics are the parts that draw me to the book as it is my avocation. Just by reading that chapter just smacks you of market failure. And this book is recomended also to people who has some erudition in economics and want to learn some developmental economics pertaining to the Philippines."
3,America's Boy deserves a second look.,"James Hamilton-Paterson's America's Boy distinctly resounds the not-too-obvious desires of most Filipinos - i.e., a return to the Marcos years.Both the Left and the Right would love to see a repeat of Marcos's regime.Partly anecdotal but mostly scholarly, America's Boy lives up to its purported goal: to dissect the Marcos couple and reveal their underlying shortcomings. The fact that the author never failed to mention the imperialistic character of the United States gives credence to a 3-star rating for this title."
4,Practical,"Exactly as the tile says this book is practical and nothing more! Don't look for any explanations or detailed studies but for disorders and solutions, that's all that is presented here, along with real cases examples. [...]"
4,A most necessary resource,This wonderfully written book has now become one of my favorites. Wagner masterfully proves his authority for writing this manual and then explains that true humility is not something that only a few can achieve. It is a choice that we all must make. A must read for anyone serious in their relationship with God!
5,Greatly needed,After reading this book I am better able to live and work with other people. Its put things in there proper perspective. We never stop learning about ourselves
1,Last Vampire on Earth,"Sorry this movie shown was like watching a homemade video. The. Quality is very poor noisy, and shaken. Meaning the picture throughout the movie. I'm going to trade it at a local video store. Hopefully! .And I really didn't believe him to be a real vampire. The DVD cover is beautiful, but very misleading for the movie type."
2,A very general approach to organizing. No substance.,"This book spells out what areas to organize and thats it. It covers everything from files to designing custom closets--but with very little detail. I went through this in one night and felt very cheated. I did get the use of one good tip--how to get rid of my magazines. But that's all! Either this book is very elementry or I am extremely organized--and I know the latter is not true. If your really serious about orgainizing, keep looking. I wish I did."
1,Badly needs updating.,"This book is so outdated as to be laughable. She talks about carbon paper and white-out! Computers are treated as something for technologists. She says Sidekick is the most popular software. In fact it is no longer marketed or supported. Memory typewriters are compared favorably to computers! However, her Two-List Time Plan was worth the price of the book."
3,Great for the basics but otherwise review,"Great tips if you are in need of some basics on getting organized, but for some of us who work in an office, especially in administration, much of what is contained in this book is simple review of common knowledge. The areas around the closet would be great, if it applies to the personal layout of your home."
5,Like to move your body to the beat?,"Then this is a disc for you. Like the other reviewers have said, there is a large variety of material to chose from here, and it all grooves! Some of the lyrical content is political in nature, and some is puerile. But it all hits you where you live, where the part of you that loves to grind is.Even I have to move to to groove - and I'm a no rhythm white boy!"
3,They are zip disk,Good price for a trio. Wish I didn't have to keep buying them for my MPC2K but I have no choice.
5,Good battery life,"On my Canon Elura 100, the BP-208 is sufficient to record a 60 minute tape and then spend 30 to 60 minutes reviewing the tape. The actual usable time may be 2.5 hours as listed in some reviews, but rather than have the camcorder die while I'm recording, I switch batteries at about 2 hours when the battery indicator gets very low (usually 1/4 charge indicator, sometimes 0/4 charge indicator)."
2,Changeling Falls Short,"Micol Ostow has serious writer's block here. Her writing is not creative, not funny, the plot lacks action, magic and wit. Everything goes very easy in this book and I found it was VERY, VERY, VERY long-winded. The action comes only at, guess what Chapter 6! Yada-yada-yada for 5 chapters and a prologue, until finally something remotely dangerous pops up. The ending also falls short. Micol's spells do not rhyme throughout the book and my guess is that she got so fed up she resorted to 'The Power of Three will set us free!' On TV, that spell would prove a good change. In the book, it was tacky and boring. She tries to spice things up with a 'Wyatt power boost' but that fell short too. The demon hardly showed any powers and sounded more like a grouchy, grumpy dad who found the thief that stole his china. Sigh... What happened to great Charmed?"
3,It's average,"I have loved all the Charmed books I've read up until this point. This book was good in the sense that I am glad they have finally writen a book about baby Wyatt, but there was just something about it that I didn't particularly like. One thing that made me a bit mad when i read this book was that there was a lot of spelling mistakes and some of the sentences didn't make sense....it was like the editors didn't go back through the book to check for mistakes or errors. But besides that, i think the book had a fairly good plot with the human babies being switched with the elf babies and so on. I really do think it was a good book, a very good book, but it could have done without the spelling errors..."
2,Changeling Characters?,"When baby Wyatt starts acting strangely after spending time in day care, Piper suspects something is seriously wrong. Soon enough, the sisters learn that Wyatt has been replaced with a changeling. Indeed, it seems that the main characters have been replaced as well. Piper doesn't worry about Wyatt using his powers in day care, and, when they discover the deception, Leo, who does little but moralize about the dilemma working mothers face, seems barely concerned.My main problem with this book is that everything is a little too easy. The sisters have no problem finding the elfin village, and the demons they vanquish barely put up a fight. The Elders, strangely enough to viewers of the series, even offer helpful information!Still, it's a short book and may satisfy your Charmed appetite when the show is in reruns."
4,baby switching,"piper has decided that it is time to go back to work after having wyatt. the perfect solution seems to be to put him in a daycare that paige is working at as a temprary job.but soon piper notices changes in wyatt's behavior. he cries all the time and he will barely eat. she wonders if this is a cause for concern or should she be looking deeper into the problem?meanwhile at the daycare center, mothers are mysteriously pulling their babies out with little or no warning. paige's spider sense is up and she is determined to get to the bottom of this mystery. it seems that the babies are being switched so some demon can make an army. can the charmed ones figure out how to defeat this demon before it is too late?the book is a little too g rated for me. they have piper giving up a little too quickly when things don't go as planned. if all stay at home moms had that notion, thw workforce would definitley be in trouble. it is an ok book for all charmed fans desperate for something to read."
3,An Objective History of Taoism,"I was a little disappointed after reading this book because I was looking for a great deal more in the way of the philosophy of the Tao. What I got was an excellent history of, for the most part, religious Taoism. The book was concise and readable while proving to be an excellent resource for further study. The text is packed with references to books of Taoist masters and books of study. Since the author is a Taoist I expected to see a little more subjectivity in the writing style. Nevertheless I recommend this book to anyone wanting a objectively historical view of Taoism."
2,Uninspiring book - but at least it's short,"This book looks like it was written from a bunch of lecture notes and encyclopedia excerpts - without any kind of personal input. At least it's short, covers a little bit of everything from shamanic rituals to feng-shui, and will give you enough to make a good impression on the new-agey, spiritual types (after a few drinks).Did I mention that it's mercifully short?For a more personal introduction seeTaoism: The Road to Immortality"
1,Shonky schoolarship,"Eva Wong is quite generic in her approach to Taoism and the book reads like something written to make money. There is a lot of Chinese people out there seeking to cash in on the Western interest in Taoism. Due to the ""Cultural Revolution"", being of Chinese nationally is no longer a guarantee of knowledge of Chinese Culture, as most modern Chinese know little of Ancient Culture because the Communists where so effective in wiping it out. Her book covers an extremely broad overview of Taoism with almost no citations. I cannot know how many errors and assumtions she makes in her book, but as far has her information on Ba kua zhang and internal martial arts in general, I would not trust a word she has to say. I suspect that she is coming from a Post-Communist ""Wu shu"" perpective that has very little creditality with tradional Chinese martial artists. If you want to get a general overview of Taoism you would be far better off reading Liva Kohn's works on the subject."
2,four of the ten batteries dead,"I ordered a 10-pack of these at the end of this past summer. Only 6 of them seemed to accept charge; the other four seemed to be mere paperweights. I tried charging those multiple times but still got a voltage reading of zero across each of them. (On the other hand, the 6 that work seem to work somewhat well.) I have been using a Sunpak Rapid Charger."
1,"Ordered 2 ten packs, tried 3 different chargers, only 4 batteries worked","I had heard some good things about Lenmar nimh batteries about two years ago - but had bought another brand. This time around, with the good price on Amazon, I gave these Lenmar batteries a try. I ordered two ten-packs. Only 4 out of 20 batteries would accept a charge. I tried an Energizer charger, a LaCrosse BC-900 charger, and a RipVan100 Lightning Pack 4000N charger. None of these would charge 16 of the batteries - even in the 'recovery' modes. In the process of returning the batteries to Amazon."
2,Disappointing,"Terri Crisp does wonderful work with animal rescues, but not with a typewriter. At several points, she mentions being under time pressure to complete this book - that's obvious in the repetitive and stilted dialog she attempts to recreate. You can almost hear her counting the words. She also seems to spend much more time than is necessary (or appropriate) complaining about the food at rescue sites; you'd think there'd be some form of 'professional courtesy' among volunteers, but in any case, it's not of interest to the reader who buys a book hoping to learn about animal rescue, not cuisine. I would stick with her first book, Out of Harm's Way, which - although also a victim of sloppy editing - had more useful information about the intended topic."
1,All About Terri,"Poorly writen, poorly conceived, and too much about Terri and not enough about the animals."
4,cool phone,"the phone is great ..i have been a sony cam man for as long as i have livedand this phone cam is the best of them yetsmall, easy to handel and takes great shots..the mp3 is exceptable feature in the phone, great sound and allonly problem is the ring tone even at the higest volume it is hard to hear at times.other than that it is a dam cool of a phone/cam/mp3 all in one small package..for a heafty price ..($200 would be a great price)but the money is worth it features it comes withhope u enjoy it as i have"
2,I've had some issues with this phone,"I've had this phone for over a month and I have had too many issues to make me want to keep it. I've already replaced one memory stick and any MP3's that you want to play will drain the battery to where the charge will not last the entire day. I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again. At one point the phone wouldn't turn back on, so I had to remove the battery and figure out why the battery wasn't working. Aside from that any pictures or videos that you want to shoot, make sure the subject is only a few feet away or the quality will be poor. For a $500 phone, I'm not impressed."
5,Great device,"I received this phone as a gift and it is by far the best electronic gadget I ever had. It is easy to use, has great phone reception, great sound for the mp3 player and it even is a nice (not the best) digital camera."
5,Sony Ericsson W800i,"This is the best phone on the planet. 2 Megapixel Camera (takes 3 sizes of pictures as well as video), play your MP3's via the 512mb Pro Duo card (phone can handle up to 2mb Pro Duo card - which is what I have), FM Radio, browses the web like a mo-fo, speaker phone, infrared/bluetooth compatible, bright 2led light, and can be synchronized to your pc. I use the alarm all the time while on trips, I use the memo's, appointment setting, I use everything on this phone and it is completely flawless. Choice size makes it convenient to carry and use. Available accessories: Camera Flash (makes yor phone a real camera), Transmitter (so that you can play your music through the radio - way handy). Comes with software, and hands-free headphones, & charger. It's the best!"
1,Scam,Don't get scammed. The song list doesn't tell you that 1/4 of the songs are live crap. You will still have to buy the original cd's to get all the studio versions you want.
3,"Good collection, questionable track listing","I bought this because it is remastered, and Cinderella hasn't remastered any of their four studio albums. So I downloaded all of this onto my ITUNES, overriding the original analog versions.The only problem I Have is the questionable track listing. Do we REALLY need 6 songs from Still Climbing, their worst and least-selling album? Also, way too many songs from Heartbreak Station, their 2nd worst and least selling album. We also get 6 wasteful live tracks. I would have appreciated a few more tracks from the first two albums, which were their only two commercially successful releases anyway. Where's ""Somebody Save Me"" and ""Push Push?""???"
5,Great Resourse for Teaching Dance,"I purchased ""Velocity in Dance"", percussion for modern dance at Amazon.I teach dance in elementary schools and this recording is perfect forbasic improv dance lessons.The children loved the the percussion soundsthat motivated them to be creative. This is a perfect educational toolfor dance integration."
1,[WEAK],This book epitomises everything that is bad about Flash animation. Someone who can't draw and can't animate trying to bluff the general public....
5,Simply Amazing!,"This is the only book an inspiring animator will need.The book covers everything from an Introduction to Cartooning to Cinematography in Flash.I was very impressed Production chapters of the book. Ibis touches everything from script writing through the Production process. Also enlightens you movie with transition effects, dolly shots, and other Hollywood techniques.This book is definitely worth a look."
2,"Cartooning One Star, Flash Examples One=A big Dud","If you had no cartooning instruction, nor opened a 'How to Cartoon' book, and had a limited understanding of Flash this would be a good place to start. If you are well advanced in your study of both cartooning and Flash and want to put together quality animation I'm sorry to say this book will be poor help.I bought the book shortly after it was published, went to the authors website and never went back to either. To make cheap, shoddy animation you don't need an overly priced book like this...The ""Illusion of Life"" book for Flash Animation, with fine examples of how Flash can move the net, has still to be written.You've been warned."
1,Very amateurish,"This guy can't draw and wastes a lot of time demonstrating this fact. He calls himself a professional animator, but seems to be a complete amateur."
3,Oh please...,"This is like the lesbian version of ""Twilight"". The main character is so timid and clueless and helpless until she meets Ryan, her eventual love interest, who is completely perfect - attractive, intelligent, athletic, family-oriented, friendly, handy with a perfect body. There isn't anything Ryan can't do and it's incredibly annoying and makes for an eye-rolling read. Every few pages, I had to stop myself from gagging at Jamie's description of Ryan. God, even Ryan's sweat was intoxicating...For a very light, possible beach read, it's not a bad book, but it wasn't worth the $10."
2,Give me a break!,This is the most heterosexual lesbian book I have ever read. The author sure seemed to enjoy being so descriptive about the heroine's love scenes with her boyfriend! I would NOT recommend this book to anyone who likes lesbian fiction. Rather surprising because Meagher's other books actually deliver what they promise.
4,Conner and Liz should get back together hopefully....,"In this book, Liz is all stressed out about seeign Conner and talking to him, Jessica has Jeremy back now, Will and Ken becoming friends, Melissa wants to get back together with Will, Jade's with Evan now, Conner coming home from rehab for six weeks, Ken wants Maria back and Andy and Tia to go on a love-tv show to win a trip to New York! And they do!Well, it does turn out that Matt, the production assisant for the game show, is gay and likes Andy instead of Tia.Conner likes two girls: Still Liz and Alanna from rehab. Evan is all queasy around Conner because he and Liz sort of kissed and went out behind Conner's back.It was Tia's idea to throw a welcome-home party for Conner. But Conner doesn't really like parties that much.So this book was okay and great at the end when Conner kisses Liz. Except someone showing up in the middle of kissing...So read this book. It's really good."
1,Honest review...,"I was really disappointed in this book. First of all, it was bad enough how andy had to come out being gay-what happened to the boy meets girl thing? We hear enough about gay people in this world-lets not bring it into a perfectly good reading series. Not only did this book talk about andy being gay, but it also went into detail about him wanting to pursue a relationship with another guy, and talked about how he thought this one guy was hott and he was flirting with him and stuff. Im sorry, but there is no need for that. AS much as i have enjoyed this series and have read sweet valley books all my life, if francine pascal keeps this up, i will no longer read her books."
5,The Real Deal...,"A friend of mine gave this to me as a gift..she knew I wasn't too keen on some of the other discs I've tried. She thought this one would do the trick! She was right: Janet's sequencing, the music and the overall 'vibe' of the material all make for a great session. You really owe it to yourself to give this one a chance -- A great purchase...and much welcomed go-to gift when needed!"
5,Brenda Joyce has done it again!!!,"Brenda Joyce new Deadly serious is awsome. Its filled with Romance, Adventure, excitment. Keeps you on the edge of seat. I've been reading her books for like 2 years now and i refused to read anyone else until i've read every single book she has written, i'm almost there and havent been disappointed yet.They are that good the Characters just take you away to another World. The story lines are great.I just can't say enough about this serious and all her books!!You have to read them yourself and then you'll know why."
5,Simply enjoyable!,"It has been along time since I have written a review so maybethis will help make some decisions for your customers.What a pleasant way the author had to bring the Bragg familyin our world again.The charactors are well formed and come into the story verysmoothly. It has good clean romance, mystery and for a fewhours of reading it puts you back in time.There are four books and I have read three of them and cannotwait to get the last book in May.The author does put some offensive words in her writting thatis not necessary but what can I say.I rate this book high for several reasons.Good storyVery likable charactersAll three books come very smoothly back to back. She does notrepeat the last story in each book so you feel you are notreading pages of the previous book.Thank you Brenda Joyce for a job will done.Marylin GrahamGod Bless Our Troops &God Bless America"
1,"This Book Is By Fairburn, not FairBairn!!!!","Most in the know who see the byline of W.E. Fairbairn think of the former British Commando and Shanghai Police Chief who was instrumental in saving the lives of uncounted SAS and OSS operatives with the hand-to-hand combat training he delivered in their training camps. Richard Dunlop said of Fairbairn:""All of us who were taught by Major Fairbairn soon realized that he had an honest dislike for anything that smacked of decency in fighting.""The idea was to win a fight and win it quickly.This book (if you look closely at the cover) was written by one Richard Fairburn (who I do not know) and neither he nor Fairbairn's memory are well-served by the mistake that this book has been attributed to Fairbairn. This book was published in 1994. Fiarbairn died in 1960 and it's unlikely his estate would have waited this long to offer up any previously unpublished works."
2,"decent movie to rent, not good to own","after watching the DVD, this was disappointing to watch,the story was slow to devloping and once we got to the point of the story, well,it ended, and the ending was something to desire, you don't have any idea of what was happening,just like the first of the movie.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone that wants own the movie , RENT IT,its bad when you have to watch the bonus features after the movie to understand what the movie is really about."
3,ewe coo clock (sheep),"The sheep needs light to baa, even when you press the button. Would be nice to have the option of the sheep baa-ing the hour. It only baas once on the hour.I initially purchased from a vendor via Amazon, and a week later, after receiving an email stating that it was on its way, I was contacted by the vendor and informed that it was out of stock. I needed it right away (at that point) as a gift, so I went to a brick-and-mortar store and paid extra. It was a nice gift - got a good laugh. But I ended up NOT buying it on Amazon!"
2,Not the best,"This is harder than it looks. My sister got this for Christmas, and I have been playing it all day. I have only beet one level! Hopfully it will get beter, but for now, 2 stars."
3,the best game in the world,help the twins mary-kate and ashley olsen find the most admired boy crushes. this game has over 30 levels of fun. 1 to 2 players can play. i recommend that you buy this game for your children if they love mary-kate and ashley olsen.
3,Best mary-kate and ashley game yet!,"Help Mary-kate and ashley find out who has a mystery crush on them. the actities you do on this game is, play in the arcade, mini golf, dance and cheerleading tryouts,putting on new outfits, taking photos and much much more!!!!!!!!!This game is a fun game but if you beat it more than once it will get boring fast! This game is difficult and you should probaly be 7 or older. If you like a challenge this game is for you!If you dont have a memory card you should not buy it because when you start again you will have to start from the begining.I would suggest renting it to see how you like it before asking for it for christmas or just for a gift!!!!!!!!!"
1,Don't Bother Buying This One,"My daughter (7 years old) got this game for Christmas 2001. The difficulty level on this game is beyond her ability. My husband and myself even tried repeatedly to win certain parts of this game. I found it very difficult and the camera angles on almost all of it were really bad. You could not see where you were going, that is until you fell down or ran out of time trying to get a better angle. I was not impressed with the game and I will not buy another one. (assuming that they are all the same).Don't waste your money, or your time because once you solve it the first time - it is no longer fun. Trust Me"
4,Andis dryer,"Product dries hair quickly. Although larger and heavier than most folding dryer's,the price was good and so far the quality has been good also."
1,Should have paid attention....,"I should have paid more attention to some of the negative reviews. Received dryer today. Pulled out cord. Pushed button to retract. Nothing. Tried to coax it back in and could only push it part way. Returning it to Amazon. And, am going to avoid Andis products. If they want to enter the low end market, they should make a product that works."
4,And is RC-2 Ionic1875w ceramic hair dryer,"This hair dryer works great. My first purchase broke after just two weeks, the heating element became too hot and the hairdryer shut off. My replacement however has been fine. Drys hair quickly and leaves it feeling smooth and silky. It is light weight and easy to hold while styling with a brush in the other hand."
2,finish becomes sticky.,"This dryer has a retractable cord, which is nice, but not when it fails to retract, which it did. After several years and very little use, the black finish became very sticky, so I don't use it now. The best feature was a button to turn off the heat. Can't recommend this dryer though."
2,Nothing special,"Like the size, retractable cord and how the unit fols nicely! Biggest complaint is that it does not have a direct enough defusser. Hair blows all over when trying to style with a brush. Overall ,heat and power is not any better than several other dryers out there."
4,A bit clunky but it still saves on space,I had an Ion folding arm travel dryer that needed to be replaced so I purchased this. I used the travel dryer as my usual dryer just to save space in my bathroom drawers. This one is a bit bigger. I am not sure I would use this for travel though. I like the folding arm and retractable cord. It is not quiet but a lot quieter than my old Ion. It has 3 speeds which is nice. My daughters (5 and 2) use medium and I use high. We all have very thick shoulder length hair. It does leave our hair soft and shiny as my Ion did. Good purchase and price. I have only had it a week so I can't comment on durability yet.
3,Not bad for a small dryer,"We just moved to a smaller place with a tiny bathroom and the old monster dryer with the long twisted cord wasn't cutting it. I love the retractable cord, although it doesn't always completly retract each time. Folding in half does save some space as well. From the reviews I was hoping for reasonably quiet but it sounds like a leaf blower on high, louder even than my old monster. Overall, not bad for the price, wish it were quieter."
4,Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer with Design Improvements,"My old hair dryer was eight years old - it got very hot, but it still didn't dry my hair very well, and I could smell burning hair when I used it. I decided to try the ionic/ceramic technology to see if it would work better and be less damaging.I no longer smell burning hair, but the speed at which my hair dries is only minimally faster. My favorite part of this dryer is the design for compact storage - not only does the handle fold in, but the cord retracts - especiallly nice if you are constantly stuffing your dryer in a small drawer."
2,Great until...,I have very thick hair that's hard to dry. This blow dryer dries my hair quickly and I loved the retractable cord. It was a great blow dryer till it stopped working 3 months after I bought it. Now what?
5,Great little hairdryer....,"a little powerhouse, that stores its own cord, fits nicely in a drawer, and, so far, reliable. I used this model at the Four Seasons Santa Barbara, and was able to locate it on Amazon. I ordered one for each of my bathrooms!"
3,I like it but,I like it but the other reviewers that said that it stops retracting were right. But it's powerful and I like that it folds in half. So now I just wrap the cord around it. But I wish it still retracted. :(
1,Need Help with operation...,"Hi, I just bought this product recently and I am very new to hair dryer.Can any tell me how to use this hair dryer, as whenever I plug in the power cord and wait for the coil to heat up, it not getting heated up and I am unable to use it.Is something wrong with my hair dryer? Please explain me how to use this hair dryer in detail... Your effort will be very much appreciated.Thank you :)"
5,"Small, compact and powerful!","Bought this together with the other Andis Tourmaline model. This one is for my daughter. The hairdryer is powerful yet light and we love the retractable cord! It stores away neatly in the bathroom cabinet. We have been using these Andis hairdryers daily for 2 years now and both are still going strong. I have never heard of this brand until I used this in a luxury hotel - I was so impressed with the performance and design of the item that I searched for it online when we got home. For the price, design and performance, this is a great buy!"
1,Had to Return Them,"I ordered two. The first time I turned it on, it tripped the circuit breaker. I didn't even try to plug in the second one. It had features that I liked so I was sorry that it didn't work out."
5,Wife Loves It,Not too much to say; it works well and is powerful. Retractable cord is great. Highly recommended.
1,Used only twice before it died,"This was a piece of crap. I used it once where the air flow was so weak I figured I'd have better luck drying my hair if my friend blew on it. The 2nd time I attempted to use it, it sparked and died. I left it in a trash can in Paris.DO NOT BUY!!!!"
4,Love my new hair Dryer,I love it because it retracts and folds. Its not that heavy that you can bring it with you when you travel. My hair dries quickly. I gave a 4 stars because the dryer is not that hot.
5,"Great Features, but is it durable?","On my second try here. Features and performance is great, but first one failed after short time. If this one doesn't last longer, there won't be a third."
1,Retractable cord problem,"Although this hair dryer worked fine to dry my hair, the retractable cord button kept getting ""stuck"" and wouldn't retract the cord. Amazon was very accommodating to the problem and immediately sent me a second dryer. Incredibly, the second dryer had the same problem! I am returning both of them - very disappointed. I love the idea of a retractable cord - might try a different brand!"
5,Very Satisfied,"I purchase this dryer after trying one at a hotel. My husband said, we have got to get one of these ""Andis"". I have very thick long hair and found this to be a good dryer. I also have Carpel Tunnel and appreciate this is a light weight dryer compared to most. I will buy this product again and don't expect that for a long time."
3,LOUD & Cord Gets Stuck (Does Not Retract All the Way),"I'm actually going to return this hair dryer. It's unfortunate (and I'm giving it 3 stars) because it dries my hair well (and my hair seems less frizzy than with other dryers), but it is simply too loud (I feel like using it too much will damage my hearing), and the cord keeps getting stuck (even when i try to help push it into the unit), which is frustrating. Overall, I'm bummed that this one didn't work out..."
3,Good ... and not so good,"Pros:1. This blow dryer is great for the price. Just don't expect a $100+ ionic dryer. You get a nice $18 dryer for $18 - simple.2. Nice looking, sleek design, with retractable cord. This is not a compact dryer for travel - it should be considered more of a ""mid-size"".Cons:1. Retractable cord is quite short, which could be a problem if your outlet is not very close by.2. Very loud! I saw others complain about this, and now I know what they mean. It's loud.3. The retractable cord failed to retract after a couple of uses. This is disappointing considering it was a major factor in my purchase.Bottom Line:Does it dry hair quickly and make it smooth and silky?? No more than any other dryer. It's a nice, inexpensive, blow dryer, but I personally would not purchase it again."
2,Great air flow but too loud!,"The retractable cord is wonderful. The air power is good and it does a nice job drying your hair. As mentioned by others, it is heavy. The handle is also clumsy to hold, especially for someone with small hands.My main objection is that it is much too loud and for that reason alone I would not buy it again."
3,"Folding Handle works, but Retractable cord stopped working","After only 2-3 times of using the Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord, the retractable cord no longer retracts on it's own. I must push in the handle manually, while pushing in the button on the body in order to get to retract.This is not a light-weight blow dryer. So if you are looking for a small one to tuck in the overnight bag, think again. Besides the weight, it is full size in length as well, which just happens to fold.It seems to dry just fine, however I never dry on the high speed... just too loud. So I normally use the low speed, which is plenty fast for my short hairdo.The price was fine and it arrived timely; just as it appeared in the photo shown on the Amazon website."
3,NIce but Cumbersome,"This item was larger than expected. Length & height were as represented, but the blower itself was ""fat"". My wife is the one who uses it the most, and she found it to be large and cumbersome. Having said that, it appears to be well made. The noise level is less than other hairdryers, and we believe the Andis brand will give us long trouble free performance. But, this is not a travel hair dryer... home duty only."
3,Why Can't This Work?,"Disappointed in the retracting cord. Why can't engineers build enough horsepower in the retractor to always allow the cord to retract fully? Where's the safety factor? Charge the extra $3 per unit and upgrade the retract mechanism. How many of you have wives and daughters that have to sit there and play with the darn thing to get the cord all the way in? Otherwise, the unit must dry their hair sufficiently."
4,Had to have it.,"The Lowes Vanderbilt Hotel in Nashville puts these in their rooms. After using it, I had to have one so came home and immediately ordered it. It is easy to use and leaves my hair shiny. The cord does require a couple of trys to retract sometimes."
3,"It does the job, but I wouldn't buy it again.","I read all the reviews before purchasing this hairdryer and have to say they were all spot-on. I had been using a travel hairdryer and liked that it was compact, yet powerful enough to get the job done quickly.On the pro side, I find the Andis RC-2 hairdryer is not as harsh as my old one was when drying my hair. My hair doesn't seem as dry/frayed looking. The air seems ""softer"", which also means that it takes a little longer to dry.On the con side, the hairdryer is bulky and heavier than my old one. The retractable cord component works most times, but does need some help and has gotten stuck a couple of times (I've had the hairdryer a month now). The handle is square, which I thought wasn't a big deal when I read the other reviews, but it isn't as comfortable as my old one.It'll do for now, but I wouldn't buy it again."
3,not even a year and the cord stopped retracting,"I bought this for the retractable cord, used it barely three times a month since I got it, and the cord stopped retracting. Still a decent buy if you get it on sale, since it works as an ionic dryer should. Would have been perfect if it came with a diffuser and the retractable cord hadn't stopped retracting in less than a year with limited use."
2,Retractable cord doesn't last,The retractable cord lasted for about 2 weeks. It was also much bulkier than I expected.
3,My Andis failed this morning....,Purshased in May 2008 and has been reliable until this morning when the motor gave out. Did not even last two years which seems like a short life span. I noticed it seemed to be running hotter than usual until it just stopped while in middle of drying my hair.I liked the folding feature of the dryer which takes up less space than others.I gave up on using the retractable cord not long after I purchased it for fear that it would get stuck while retracted into the dryer which started to happen.I'm not sure I would purchase again.
1,Misleading Search result...NOT 220V hair dryer!,"BEWARE!! This is NOT a 220V hair dryer! I searched this website for a 220V hair dryer and this was included in the results. I ordered it, shipped it overseas, paid duties, etc. only to find out that it is NOT a 220V hair dryer! Most disappointed since I can't even try it out...."
5,Powerful and convenient,"I love my ANDIS Ionic Ceramic Hair dryer, I throw it in my travel bag, it has all the power of a bigger, heavier dryer. I love the retracting cord and folding feature, it stores neatly at home as well. Awesome product."
3,Disappointment,I was very disaapointed in my hair dryer. After two weeks of usage the button for the retractable cord broke and NOW THE CORD DOES NOT RETRACT. This is the main reason I bought this hair dryer. I am very DISAPPOINTED in the product. Linda Slocum
3,Andis 80020,The first one I received was broken and had to be returned. The second arrived ok but the cord stopped retracting after 4mths and now I am back to having the same type of hairdryers I used to have. Not impressed with the dryer at all.
4,Great find!,"I was having problems with my dryer almost burning my hair. Used this dryer at a hotel in Charleston, SC and saw visible results in one day. Just didn't know where to find it so Googled the brand & found it on Amazon. Was amazed that it was so inexpensive. Ordered one and am so pleased will order two more this Spring - one for my home up north & one for my husband."
4,Like but too heavy.,I like the hair dryer. It works great but is heavy and a little big. Did not realize it would be that heavy as I wanted to use it when I trave since it folds up. Will have to see how well it works to pack it.
1,Stopped working after 4 months,Worked great the first 4 months and then died unexpectedly without warning. Not pleased - would have expected to get at least a year out of it!
5,Excellent hair dryer,I tried this in a recent hotel stay and had to order one for myself at home. The dryer has a retractable cord which is nice and it drys your hair quickly and without frizz.
2,Works well but only for a while,"I bought this 5 months ago, and it croaked. Just like that,it starting to smell burned (w/o smoke) and then it stopped. It wasn't the socket, it was the dryer. Too bad--it was a good price and it when it worked, it worked well. The best part about it was the retractable cord....next! Go for a brand name like Conair or Sasson. Their dryers last."
3,Andis RC-2 Hairdryer Not Made for the Long Haul,This product has some nice features. I have purchased two of them for different bathrooms in my home. I was surprised when the first one I bought died after barely passing the two year mark. I may buy another one just because I like this dryer but I definitely know what to expect now.
1,Lasted exactly one year,"Read the other reviews...I wish I had spent more time reading them! This hair dryer lasted 1 year to the day almost. While it worked, it was very nice.... though the retractable cord feature stopped working shortly after purchase. But I did like the concept - a folding handle with a retractable cord. Too bad the quality is so poor. STRONGLY ADVISE - DO NOT BUY THIS BLOW DRYER. There are too many reviews like this one."
5,Hair dryer,I like the design of this hairdryer. I bought 2 of them for gifts and the recipients seems to really like them.
4,Wife likes hair dryer,I bought this hair dryer to replace an old one that my wife had. She likes the fact that it has a folding handle and can be used on trips etc. She does not use it everyday at home as it is mostly a back-up. I would like to review it again after a few months or a year to see how it works then.
3,Larger in size than expected,"This is a 4 star product but I gave it a 3 star as it is a 'travel' hair dryer. It should be much smaller than it is even with the cool shot button. Like many women, I need all the room I can have in my luggage for other things especially that most hotels & B&B's have hair dryers in them (though w/o a cool shot button ofcourse). It is not a critical item in travel. It should be much smaller in size with the same quality & cool shot. It's 2012 & this shouldn't be difficult technology."
1,It is not dual voltage,It did not work in Europe. Every hotel in the US has a hair dryer. Why would I carry this with me? However we need it in Europe when we travel. Garbage!
4,Misrepresented it is not small for traveling purposes,"I feel that this product was misrepresented since it was listed in the travel dryers. It is the size of any ""large"" dryer and I needed a dryer for traveling that was compact to fit into a small case. It had all the requirements I wanted except way too large. I have two large ones already.""IT WAS NOT COMPACT"" That was my only complaint. I sent it back of course."
2,Good dryer except for the warranty,"The dryer does a good job as a dryer. The retracting feature on the cord failed within a couple of months. Andis warranty requires that the buyer pays for shipping it in, plus $6.50 to cover their handling. That should come to about the cost of buying a new one. Which I won't. I will go with another brand that really backs their products."
1,Breaks after a couple months,"Like another reviewer, I received this for Christmas 2006 and it stopped working the beginning of April. I really liked it but it just died. I'm finding out that this is a common problem. It would probably be best to spend a little more to get a better quality dryer than to replace this one a couple time a year."
4,Good dryer,"All in all, it's a good little hair dryer. It doesn't blow as hot as my older dryers, but it dries my hair fast and with less sweating on my part!! The retractable cord is kind of sluggish & doesn't retract all the way. But it's still an improvement over regular cords that were always getting tangled up with my curling iron cord. The folding handle definitely makes it easier to pack. I'm not real sure if I notice much difference with frizz. Maybe a little better. The only negative comment I can make is that it's very LOUD!"
5,"Tough on my cat, but great on hair!","I bought this when my Conair travel dryer finally gave up after nearly a decade. I purchased this specific dryer because of the retractable cord, and love it! The added benefit is that it dries my hair so quickly, but it was the cord feature that sold me. Warning: as the previous reviewer mentioned, cats don't like this dryer. When the cord retracts it must sound like the retracting cord on my vacuum cleaner because my 13 year old cat flies off the bathroom counter as soon as I pull the cord to plug it in. Otherwise, it's a great little dryer."
2,Disappointed,I found this hair dryer to be much bigger then anticipated. The cord does not retract completely and has to be pushed in by handfor the last few inches. It is heavy and the handle is very bulky.
3,Good dryer,"Pretty good hair dryer. I have thick, curly hair that I dry straight every day - so most travel dryers won't do the trick at all. After reading all the reviews I decided to give this one a try. The 1875 watts is great - it blows hard and gets hot, which my hair requires to get the curl out. (That's on high heat though, so don't let that deter you if you don't like that.) The down side to this dryer is the SIZE. I read it in the reviews, but for whatever reason decided that since it's categorized as a ""travel"" dryer, it must be smaller...but it's really not. The opening where the air blows out is so large, that you really need the attachment to get targeted air. With the attachment on, it's actually larger than my everyday dryer. The only benefit is that the handle folds up so it takes a little less packing space.So - if you need power, it's the best ""travel"" dryer I've found. If you need ""small""...keep looking. :)"
2,Heat stopped working after less than 2 years : (,I liked the hair dryer but after less than 2 years the heat stopped working. The retractable cord didn't really work so well after the first few months. You had to push it in.
1,If you want your cord retractable dont buy it.,I purchased this mainly for the retractable cord because my storage space is limited. The cord does not retract well and when it does still leaves about a foot hanging out. Even has a stopper (if it reaches it) that leaves about 8 inches out. I didn't even try to plug it in. Love Amazons return policy.....
2,Disappointed,"Dryer itself works well. I like the 3 speeds but only use 2 of them. The dryer is heavier than I expected and the retractable cord is a joke. First of all, it does not retract all the way. There is around 8"" of cord remaining after holding the button down to it's fullest extent. On top of that the retraction mechanisim stopped working after only 2 weeks."
4,"Good product, but heavy","The product is really good, the hair becomes shine and soft. The only problem (which is a big one for me, since I have a lot of hair) is that it is heavier than I exoected and I get really tired when I dry all my hair."
4,A Retractable Hair-Dryer?,"The hair-dryer cord comes in handy. Now I don't need to make sure the cord isn't touched by water. The hair-dryer has a softer sound to it, so it doesn't disturb any one in the house."
2,Heavy and not any better than dryer at the gym,"This dryer is far bigger and heavier than a travel dryer should be. Plus, it's no better than the crappy one at the gym."
5,Powerful dryer in a compact package,"I first tried this dryer when in a hotel in SLC Utah, while traveling on business. I have really thick hair and it takes quite a while to dry. I didn't pack my own dyer as it's large and bulky, and had to use the hotel dryer. Usually these don't work as well as my own, but this one literally cut my drying time in half, leaving my hair soft and shiny! I LOVED it. I took a picture of it with my phone to remind myself to look it up when I got home. I assumed it would be expensive, so I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon for only $20. I absolutely love this blow dryer - it's compact, powerful and the folding handle/retractable cord are great little features that make it ideal for traveling. I have recommended it to friends and will continue to!"
3,"Too Heavy, Not Good for Travel","I was looking for a compact travel dryer and what drew me to this one was the retractable cord and folding capability. Based on the reviews I thought it would work well for travel. The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was the weight of the dryer. Probably the heaviest hairdryer I've owned. I plan to keep it and use it at home, but now I still have to find a travel dryer."
3,not good for people with arthritis or smaller hands,"this dryer works great, folds up nicely, the only thing is... the handle, it is to big around, and it is to smooth, I had a hard time hanging on to it.If it had some ridges that might have helped. And it was hard trying to hold the cool button down while trying to set my hair."
2,Worked great but didn't last,"This hairdryer was my favorite one until it mysteriously stopped working one day for no reason. When it did work, it dried my hair (thick & wavy) in about 5 minutes! I also loved the retractable cord. When unfolded, this is a full size hairdryer and it is weighty which I liked about it. However, it won't turn on less than 1 year after I got it. I have had previous hair dryers for years with no problems. This is not an expensive hair dryer so it was great while it lasted. I am giving it two stars because it didn't last. (while it worked, I'd give it a 5)"
2,Short Life Span,"As others have said, this works OK for a while but everything seems to break eventually. I used this product lightly, however the cord retractor broke after the button fell off and now the power switch doesn't operate properly so I have to unplug it to turn it off. Also, it is a bit loud."
4,Works great,"I really like this hair dryer. It dries quickly, not real noisy, and the retractable cord is a great convenience in my tiny bathroom."
1,The worst blow dryer in the world,"I usually do not believe negative reviews if there are many, many, many more positive reviews. However, I wish I had with this blowdryer. I almost never review items and when I do, they are positive. But this is a first. This is the worst product Ive ordered on Amazon. A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. Literally the worst blowdryer. Isn't it a travelling blowdryer? I took it to south america, a week after I'd bought it, and it overheated and shut off. Needed to wait to cool off. Now its been maybe 2 months? And it literally does not dry for more than 5 minutes because it over heats.HORRIBLE blow dryer. Seriously, do not waste your money. It is the worst I've ever seen. Get one at the pharmacy for $5 more and you will be better off.Now I need to get a new blowdryer....thanks...."
1,Piece of Junk,Loved this dryer for the first month. Completly died after one month of light use. Avoid at all cost. Died right after the return period expired.
5,What a delight for my hair!,I first tried this product at Four Seasons Hualalai in Kona. I just loved everything about it so bought 2 on line and then 2 more wanting to share this with my close friends and sister. And delievery time was speedy so got to owning my own hairdryer ASAP. My hair dries faster and feels fuller..Thank You!
2,Should last longer than 2 years,"I liked this dryer for the 2 years it lasted. I didn't use the retractable cord much as so many reviewers complained of it breaking. My problem was that it only lasted for 2 years, and I have thin, fine hair so it wasn't like I burned the thing up. It was convenient for travel and did a good job, just didn't last. So here I am looking to buy another hair dryer again. I'll try something else this time. Hopefully all hair dryers are not built to be disposable!"
4,Andis Ionic Hair Dryer,The Andis Ionic Hair Dryer has alot of power in drying your hair quick! The controls and the retractable cord works great. What's best is the folding handle which doesn't take up much space but it's slightly heavy.
4,Really great hair dryer,"I initially purchased this to use as a travel blow dryer (mainly for the gym). It turns out, that it works better than the one I keep at home. I have fairly thick hair, and it's gone from chin length to an inch or so below my shoulders since I bought it.Pros:-Dries my hair very quickly-Retractable cord is awesome (don't need to deal with winding it around the dryer)-Folding handle is awesome as well (takes up less space when storing)-Not bulkyCons:-Very heavy, and thus not very portable which defeats my intended purpose"
5,I bought this after trying it at a hotel,"I recently stayed in a high-end hotel, and this is the hairdryer that was in my room. After using it just once, I had to buy one for myself whatever the cost. When I got home and placed the order, I was surprised and pleased to see that this hair dryer is also a great value. There are not too many bells and whistles on this dryer, just a good, strong flow of air that isn't too loud. It also folds into a compact size and includes a retractable cord, so it is easy to store in a drawer."
4,Strong dryer,I've been looking for a powerful hair dryer and found this at a resort. I was happy that I found it online and it was so reasonable. I like the retraactable cord and hope it lasts. Some of the reviews were negative on this. It leaves my hair dry in minutes and soft. More powerful than some of the other larger hair dryers I've purchased.
2,Failed after 8 months,"I liked the dryer and I may buy another. But after 8 months of everyday use with no problems, it started to overheat in 2 to 5 seconds (glow) and would auto shutoff due to overheating. I think this was related to the switch going bad. The dryer is also loud."
5,Excellent purchase experience.,I ordered and received my merchandise exactly as promised. No muse and no fuse. Just a perfect buying experience. I would recommend this vendor.
4,Great Hair dryer,I first found this hair dryer while staying at Mariott hotel and LOVED IT. I always bring my own with me on trips but this time I never used it. Great power yet small and with the retractable cord very easy to store.
2,"this is too big, with noise, and low heat","although the handle can be folded, but it's still too big to carry around when you travel,heat is not strong, it takes long to dry your hair.and the noise level is just so high, make you deaf!"
4,Great Hair Dryer for Ethnic Hair,I first used this hair dryer in a hotel and fell in love with it. It dries my hair quickly without drying it out and the retractable cord and folding handle makes it easy to pack and easy to store. The quick cool shots of air are great too! Highly recommended.
5,Love this hairdryer,"I first discovered this hairdryer at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua resort and loved it. I ordered one for myself as soon as I returned home. Love the way it dries my hair without scorching, frizzing or so much pressure I can't style it properly. Medium works great for me. Also loved the folding handle as my bathroom space is limited. As others have mentioned, be careful not to pull the cord out too far, as mine stopped retracting after 18 months. With almost 3 years of daily use, it finally died. I immediately ordered another one. At this price, one every 3 years is a bargain."
1,hairdryer bought in Oct. on Amazon stopped working in June,"Loved this hairdryer until it stopped working one morning when my hair was only halfway dry. I tried it in other outlets, waited for it to cool off, etc. but it was not going to revive. Nothing unusual was going on; it just died."
3,One its way out after 1 1/2 years........,"Good dryer for the money, I guess. I too has some trouble with the cord not fully retracting after a very short time owning it. Overall, it did what it was supposed to do, although I didn't notice a huge difference over the job the ""old fashioned"" $10 dryers I used to buy from the drugstore, before they became such complicated and expensive things. This is starting to overheat and not dry properly after about 14 months of light (but daily)use. While I know small appliances aren't made for long term use anymore, think I'll go back to something much simplier to replace it."
4,"First worked for three years, second for three seconds","Due to our bathroom layout, a dryer with a retractable cors and folding handle works best. I bought one of these three years ago. It was used almost daily by my husband. Due to his current hair ""style"" (short on the sides, missing on the top), each use was for less than a minute.When it stopped working (just wouldn't turn on), I looked for another model, but this was the only one with both the handle and cord features. Easy decision. I ordered another and put it in his cabinet. The next day he tried it (he forgot his old one had broken and said that it only went on for a few seconds before it would turn off. It turned back on without any resets, but repeatedly stayed on for only a few seconds.So, I dug out the box from the recycling and returned it to Amazon. Two days later, the third one was in his cabinet. Three weeks later, Dryer #3 is working fine.Basically it is a decent, no frills dryer that does exactly what it is supposed to."
1,Retratable cord not reliable :(,"I wanted and purchased this one because of it is ceramic with a retractalbe. However, the entire dryer is bulky and the retratable cord went down soon, which is very annoying...."
1,Disappointed Andis Purchaser,"After 3 1/2 months after purchasing this hair dryer, the unit has burned out. This was not the first time I have experienced this same problem with this same dryer. A year ago I purchased the same dryer and the had the same problem. Would I ever buy another Andis product...NO!"
5,Love this hair dryer,"I first used this hair dryer in the Hyatt Regency in Baltimore, Maryland. I absolutely loved it and wrote down the name and style so I could order it. It is compact and has a lot of power. It dries your hair fast and just retract the cord, fold up and store. I love it."
1,"Loved it, then it died.","Had for less than a month before it died. Loved the size, retractable cord, folding ability. It's a bit heavy for a travel dryer, but I didn't buy it for that....just it's compact size and retractable cord. It just stopped working less than a month after receiving!!!!"
3,"Good power, way too big..","This item I bought for my girlfriend... She liked it a lot, however after some usage, the retractable cord stopped working (so you will have the wire hanging outside), but its power was really good compared to the price.. Once I bought, I have seen that this product is bigger than what it looks like, so if you are thinking on buying it for traveling purposes, DON'T!!This is to be kept at your own bathroom, but otherwise it is really good... =D"
2,disappointed,"I bought this hair dryer after using one at a Marriott hotel. Ordering online was great and I received the hair dryer within one week which was perfect since I was going on vacation and wanted to take it with me. I love the retractable cord and that the dryer folds in half.Unfortunately, within two weeks of receiving it, and the night before I went away, the switch on the dryer stopped working properly. It only works in the low position. Needless to say, I couldn't bring it on vacation and have been so busy since returning, haven't had a chance to follow up on it. Great idea, just wish it worked out better."
2,Retractable cord broke within 1st week,"Naturally, I bought this for the retractable cord. It broke within the first week. For once, I ignored other reviewers and hoped that I would be one of the lucky few who got a working retractor. It broke right away. Although it is OK, it is not one that I would have selected just as a hairdryer."
3,Wish it had more heat control settings,"My last retractable cord dryer had more heat settings than this one, so I do miss the old one. This one is okay. There are some articles that indicate ""ionic"" hair dryers do not dry hair faster than normal hair dryers. I thought it did dry my hair faster -- perhaps that is due to me pairing up this dryer with a hair paddle brush.As to the retractable cord... I would occasionally have problems getting the cord into the last dryer I had, as I occasionally have problems with this one. If the cord doesn't go in the first time, pull it all the way out, make sure its not twisted, and try it again. I often have to push the last inch or cord in."
2,Could be better,"I expected more from this hair dryer after reading the reviews. It wasn't as powerful as I like and the opening for the air coming out seems to be larger than my last dryer, so it just goes all over the place instead of being more focused. The thing I'm most unhappy with is the cord. I always buy dryers that have the retractable cord because I can't stand having to deal with the cord getting wrapped around everything in my drawer. Every other dryer that I've had the cord goes all the way into the dryer just leaving the plug hanging out. This dryer has about a foot or more of cord still hanging. It is just a pain deal with the dangling cord while putting it in and out of the drawer every day. I'm still deciding if I should return it or not."
2,It Broke!,"This hair dryer worked well for a few weeks, and I was impressed with the speed I could dry my hair and the softness from the Ionic stuff. However, after a few weeks of use it broke. It over-heated and then the off switch wouldn't work, so whenever it was plugged in, it was on! Very disappointed, as I was enjoying my new dryer!"
3,"Good dryer, but cord is NOT retractable","The hair dryer itself works pretty well, but the ""retractable"" cord is completely misleading. It stopped retracting on its own after I used it twice. With that said, the folding handle still makes it easy to store. Good buy for the price."
4,"Great dryer, too big for travel","This was my first Ionic dryer, and it dried my hair very well and quickly (although I have short hair). I only had two problems with it, but these were enough for me to return it:--Its size when folded up is a bit too big for travel. I fly frequently, and the space in my luggage is precious. This took up about the same space as a pair of shoes.--The cord did not retract smoothly or reliably. I would often have to pull it out again in order to have it retract fully.Good concept, but unfortunately it's going back!"
1,Not a reliable choice,We have owned three of these and none have been reliable. The first arrived with a cord that would not retract. Amazon replaced it and that one lasted one year before it failed. It sounded like broken bits of plastic were inside the fan so we stopped using it. We ordered another and it failed after 6 weeks. The fan speed on 'high' is about what you would get on 'low.' There seems to be a quality issue here that I advise you to stay away from.
1,flawed,"My blow dryer broke after less than 3 weeks of sporadic use. I thought it was great at first, but was very disappointed that it broke so quickly."
2,Not as great as I thought it'd be,"After reading the other reviews for this product, I was sold on it. It sounded light and compact, and perfect as a Christmas gift for my mother. I knew immediately upon opening the package that I would not be able to give it to her. While it is not huge, it is not a small travel-sized blowdryer either.So I kept it for myself because the size is comparable to other blowdryers I have used. The thing that annoys me the most is the handle which is square and not super comfortable. The Off/Low/Medium/High switch is fickle too. It has to be directly on one of the settings or the blowdryer won't work. It's not a big problem, but it is an annoyance. Although the blowdryer dries my hair just fine, I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Awesome for Curly Hair!!,I discovered this hair dryer when I stayed at the Hyatt and I found it online. That was about 4 years ago and I have not seperated with it since. This is the only blow dryer that does not make my hair frizzy and makes it soooo soft! I highly recommend it for curly-hair individuals.
2,OK not great,The dryer works OK but I bought it for the retractable cord. It works some of the time and almost never fully retracts.
1,Send your money down the drain!,The product was of poor workmanship and would have been of very little use to the person that was going to try to use it in a smallish pond. It will make a mess out of same.
3,A spritely critique,"A spritely critique of economic rationalism, and general economic market theory, as it curently applies to everyday life. While i couldn't agree with everything argued, it provided necessary food for thought. The language is accessible, enjoyable, and sets out to be deliverately provocative."
3,It was good,"I was actually there at the Baltimore Arena when this took place. It was good. The card for it was Hak vs. Brian Knobs in a Hardcore match, Mikey Whipwreck vs. Van Hammer, Buff Bagwell vs. Disco Inferno, Curt Hennig and Bobby Duncum Jr. vs. Konnan and Rey Jr., Horace Hogan vs. The Cat, Ric Flair vs. Roddy Piper for control of WCW, Sting vs. Rick Steiner, Chris Beniot and Saturn vs. DDP and Kanyon for the Tag Team Titles, And finally, Kevin Nash vs. Randy Savage for the World title. My favorite match was the Tag Team title match with DDP, Kanyon, Saturn and Beniot. I was suprised to see Sid Vicious come out and Powerbomb Nash. Some parts of the arena I heard these chants of Sids name. It was a good event. I got my moneys worth by going there."
4,Ok but...,"Peels get stuck between the blade and the metal frame that holds it. Technique can help a little, but still you have to stop and clear the peels frequently, (at least I do)I'm thinking of using a dremmel to open up the space between the blade and the frame on the side where they get stuck. Other than than it's big and comfortable to use. I like the sideways (parallel) grip better than the perpendicular (to the blade) of other peelers, but I think that those with a ""bow"" type design that keep structural parts away from the blade so that peels won't get stuck are a better design."
5,Makes peeling very easy,"I have a very old potato peeler that I thought worked great, but its getting kinda rusty and old looking, so I decided I would try a new peeler. I read all the reviews and this one sounded like the best to me. Everyone raved about how great it peeled, but I figured....how much of a difference can there really be in a peeler. Let me tell you, there IS a difference. It is very very easy to use. It just glides along the vegetable and takes off thinner slices than my old peeler. It just seems so much easier to use. I can't compare it to the other new peelers, but I can tell you if you have an old peeler, do yourself a favor and get a new one.I almost bought the one with the aluminum handle because it looks so pretty, but decided being able to put it in the dishwasher was more important than looks. It's bigger than I expected, but it still feels good in my hand, and my husband likes the bigger size (since he gets stuck doing most of the peeling). I'm very happy with this purchase."
5,Great USA made peeler makes peeling a breeze,"I've been using this peeler for a few months now and still just love it. Well designed, nice and sharp. I don't have to press hard to peel things smooth and clean and since I'm not manhandling it like my old dull crappy peeler, I don't end up peeling my own fingers - always a plus! My other half says the peels get stuck between the blade and the outer edge sometimes but I don't have that problem. :shrug:"
2,Do not like,"My Oxo died and I needed a new peeler, so I went on Amazon and because of the reviews bought this. It works okay, but the feel of this is awful. It gives me the willys whenever I use it. I will replace this when I get a chance. I prefer the OXO to this and made a mistake buying it."
2,"Handle is not aluminum, it's spray painted","1st wash in the dishwasher and the sprayed on aluminum paint washed off entirely, leaving an unattractive black handle. Really?"
4,Rada peeler,Ordered for my wife. Works very well. She has very small hands - thinks the standard size would be better for most peeling chores.
3,"a good looking peeler, if you never wash it","It's kinda big and clunky, but it can in fact peel stuff. On the other hand there's no warning that the pretty faux-aluminum handle is not dishwasher safe, and will come out of the first wash a rather hideous, murky gray. I doubt it would stand up to more than a few trips to the sink, at that rate. I see they have a black option listed as dishwasher safe, so I suppose one should pick that up if you have one of those infernal appliances in your home: somebody is going to toss the thing in with a load sooner or later and then you'll spend the rest of your life condemned to one of the lower planes of hell where all the kitchens are equipped with deformed peelers."
2,This thing is huge!,"This peeler is enormous. The cutting surface is bigger and longer than some of the potatoes I peel. The handle is too big for my hand. I don't have large hands, but they are probably average for a woman. I didn't even try this peeler. I returned it.If you have huge lumberjack hands, this might be the kitchen tool for you."
3,Rather Basic,"Although information in this 100 page pamphlet is essential, it is hardly advanced.If you are not familiar with Performance Monitor and SQL Profiler in particular, then this pamphlet is worth its price. If you have many years of experience using Performance Monitor, SQL Profiler, and SQL performance tuning in general, you will get very little new information.This is a good material for a beginner SQL DBA. But its lack of depth in technical coverage leaves a lot wanting to the experienced DBA."
2,Aspie Mom,"As a mom of an 8 yo with Asperger's, I am always looking for new ways to help my son. This book just wasn't helpful to me. It could be my son's ADHD makes his issues so much different than those she addressed. I just didn't find anything in there to help him so I didn't bother finishing it.I borrowed it from the library and for that I am thankful."
4,Excellent read and many helpful insights.,"I have a daughter with nonverbal learning disorder and this book has helped me to see that alot of her actions are actually ""normal"" for her syndrome. We as a family have struggled to try to get her to change and some of the things she CANT change. Really interesting and very helpful for everyday life. I would definatly recommend for all teachers to read this book so they can better understand their special needs kids!"
1,Derivative,"It seems like this book just copied information from earlier books on the subject and rushed to capitalize on the increase of AS diagnoses. Atwood's book is far more interesting, informative and original. I've seen this woman speak as well, and she seems a bit unclear."
4,"Nuby Precious Moments Prayer Doll, English",This bear is adorable! It has been a tradition for many years for me to buy one of these praying dolls and give it at baby showers to the new mommy-to-be. The last few years I have been unable to find them in stores. I was thrilled to find them online and ordered several. Thanks!
2,Nuby Prayer Doll,Speaks very fast and poor recording. A small child will not be able to say this prayer with the recording.
5,Want a movie that makes you think?,"Others are writing that this movie has no plot, and yes there are little plot that intertangle without any kind overall climax (but each ending will surprise you). This movie is about humanity, pure and simple. Laugh, cringe, and do a double take. Recommended for fans of Memento, 21 grams, and He Loves Me He Loves Me not."
3,Bull Rule,A bull is used as a tool uniting the different people of different countries to tackle their individual problems while dismantling environments surrounding.
4,Good for travelers but not RV's,"I should have read the reviews better. This is not meant for people touring with RV's. One problem is that is catagorized by country then city. When we are pulling a trailer across country, we want to start with the geographical area at the state level (or smaller) then the town. Also only about 54 pages (of 308) are for sites in the US. That's a lot of pages an RVer will probably not us. In my other life I travel a lot worldwide. This book would be very useful for that situation."
4,Wonderful gift!,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. She LOVED it. It arrived in a VERY timely manner, and appeared to be of good quality."
5,Great Quality,Our new puppy loved this toy from the start! Just the right size to fling with zeal and drag to her next adventure! Well-made dog toy. Our choice was the lemon yellow one. Very cute!
5,Classic of the spiritual life,"This book is a great synthesis of the spiritual life and is good for all Christians. P. Marie-Eugene explains all the facets of Carmelite spirituality in a very down-to-earth, practical way. He takes the reader through all of the different stages of the spiritual life (purgative, illuminative, unitive) with the aid of spiritual powerhouses like Sts. Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross. It is also a good primer for those seeking a foundation in spiritual theology; it also serves well as a moral theology text."
5,Great lock feature,I bought this to keep my craft supplies in. But you can store food in it as well. I love it because my little ones cannot get the top off.
1,Bratz 'Babies'?,Why do people buy these things? All they are are under-dressed weirdos.Babies ain't fashon accesories.Myscene dolls are less expensive and WAY more durable.
1,Did you ever see...,Did you ever see such an ugly baby. Jade looks chinese and why they had to make the Bratz babies after Bratz teenagers in all their stupid goth and punk. These babies have been torchered. LOOK AT THEIR CLOTHES!Hope this helps.
4,Bratz babyz rock!,"My sister owns this Jade and I think she is ok. She's not the cutest (I think Cloe, Meygan, Roxxi and Pheobe are) but she's a bratz baby, and other people have their opinons, I was just saying. Her outfit is cute, as the pink and red together looks really good, and ""Kool Kat"" is really fuzzy and adorable. The one thing I don't get about most of the babyz pets is they have no paws. Nothing. Their like bowling pins. There was a past review that said the hair is easy to loose, and it is. Keep track of them. We are currently searching for the other pigtail of Jade. All in all, it's a fairly good toy!"
5,DUH.,MAYBE JADE LOOKS CHINESE BECAUSE SHE IS CHINESE? DUH! BRATZ RRRULE AND NO BUTT CRACK CAN R A!!!!
1,This product line suckz,This poduct line sends a totally WRONG message to our yourg girls!! Would you let your daughter out of the house wearing the stuff that is on these dolls? NEVER!!!My daughter just recieved this doll from a friend for her birthday and she will never see it again.
2,Don't bother.,"Skip it--that is, if you're actually looking for a book to give you some advice on style. I would recommend ""Attention to Detail"" or ""Men's Wardrobe"" instead. What it is, in fact, is a glorified picture book, with historical annotations and some celebrity cameos. The fashion advice is not that helpful and (at least in my opinion) not always accurate. It's great on a coffee table or in some kind of lounge setting, where the occasional mindless picture book strewn around somewhere helps as a conversation piece."
4,Men of Color - What a find,I thought the book was excellent. It artfully combines historical content with practical advice that any African American male can use. I always thought it took a lot of money to look great. But using this book as a guide definitely helped.
5,My first experience with a solar powered watch,"I have had several """"Iron Man"""" Timex watches and also have owned Casio watches. One common problem has beenreplacing the batteries. In many cases, it can only be done by a professional. Once in awhile the warrantyhas been voided once the battery is replaced. And of course, the watch seems to lose time as the battery dies down.So I saw the reviews on this watch and decided to try it.It has bee great. The G2310 is much easier to use and it has kept perfect time. I chose the digital modelover the analog display because it is easier to see at night. The timer and stopwatch are easily availableand I had no problems using them. If you travel out of the country moving through time zones is a breeze.Although I haven't had this watch long enough to evaluate all the features, I am very impressed with it so farBrad Curtis"
3,No split time function.,"I bought this watch to use while running after a Timex gave up the ghost. One of the prime features in my decision to buy was that its stopwatch supported split times. The instructions came with a section on how to record split times, but no instructions on how to review them! This is because it doesn't support them!I don't have a particularly big wrist, but the watch doesn't look outsized on me. It's clearly a 'sports watch', not suitable for a suit and tie job. The solar power function works on minimal light (it remains powered up sitting in my darkened bedroom for days at a time). Accuracy isn't an issue.If it supported split times, I'd give it 5 stars."
2,Not to good quality,"The function of the watch is just fine. Its does averything its advertised for. But after a couple of years of HARD (Farm) use it starts to fall appart. My ""plastic"" bracelet started to rott and fall appart. Also The MAJOR problem: It started to reset itself to the year 2000!! So i couldnt rely on the watch anymore. The light started to fail just a few months after i got it. Would recomend? NO. (cant trust a watch that reset itself)"
4,Beautiful.,"Just beautiful.I've used it as part of a mad scientist costume & it gets more compliments than anything else.Just don't drop it, my son's broke."
3,Looked Great But............,What a neat conversation piece. The only draw back is that it didn't work. I sent it back. Was refunded. I'll have to reorder if I want to try it again.
3,too old,The copyright of this book is 1993. A lot has changed since then. A good review of the older literature
5,Grandfather Solomon,"This is an excellent interpretation for kids of my Grandfather's book ""TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE"". Professor Sue Eakin also participated in editing Grandfather Solomon's original book as a Professor at Lousiana State University. Now, I can give my 10 year old Granddaughter an excellent family history book.My Granddaughter became so engrossed with the Kids edition that she used it for a school project."
5,Masturbation is no Joke!!!!,"When I first saw the title of this book, I immediately became curious, yet a bit cautious. This is not a subject that many like to talk about, yet it is a subject worth dealing with when we look at the problems that face our society; many stemming from sexual orientations, abuses and hidden sexual attrocities.Minister Elijah Scott was brave enough to tackle masturbation. He looks at it from a personal perspective and broadens into the true essence of what this secret sin is.This could be used as a great tool to educate our younger counterparts in society as well as those who struggle with it."
1,appocolypse in a cumshot?,"well i have read the other reviews and editiorials and thought to myself, how could such a thing be a problem. And it is not untill you condemn it. The thing is that this counrty has a many paradoxing and inter-twining problems and we think we can look like profits and nobles acting like we can solve them, but come on, if you boil all of the ills of amerika and amerikans would you really find masturbation and drugs. gotta try harder than that folks."
4,"BCBGirls ""Fritzy"" Shoes are va-va-voom!","These salsa red, peek-a-boo, high heel sandals are gorgeous, and make my legs look gorgeous, too. They'll do the same for you. However, they run about 1/2 size small, so keep that in mind if you purchase a pair."
1,Its free and that is to much.,Even if its free it is not worth the time to even down load little alone read it. Very hard to understand due to the convertion to e-read. I did try as a weather geek to read this but could not do it.
4,legends of wrestling,"Acclaim makes descent wrestling games, but that was ps1. I've seen screenshots of Jimmy Snuka useing his famous Splash & Jerry Lawler using a Piledriver. The graphics look like screenshots of Smackdown 3, so this looks interesting. I would recommened this game to any fan of wrestling from the 80s to the 90's."
3,Legends of Wrestling Review,"The gameplay & Movement is sluggish but no big-time freezes,bugs or anything else that stops the game dead like third one. It lets you create wrestlers without filling up space in your memory card but you can only make 15 caws. In the career mode,you have to make sure you save it or else it won't. It's also a good reminder of the 1990's ECW because there are no count-outs and no-DQs. Infact this was originally set to be a ECW game but the company went out of business in 2001 so they changed it into this. This is the only L.O.W game that has Rob Van Dam in it. I give this game a 6 out of 10."
5,DON'T BE FOOLED,"Acclaim has made wrestling games in the past. They are the only ones besides THQ that is competing in this genre. When I first saw the title, I was interested, but when I found out that acclaim would be making it, I was suspicious. Anyone familiar with Acclaim's past track record, knows that the wrestling games they make always require impossible controller combinations to pull off the moves. The graphics are good but always choppy when it comes to moving your players around...players, I might add, that bounce and zip across the ring at speeds faster than sound. I sincerely hope that Acclaim has recognized this problem and cleans up their ""Act."" Otherwise, I fear that a perfectly good concept will be ruined by a not-so-perfect company. I'll give it 5 stars, just because it isn't fair to hit it with 1 star, when the game could be successful and thus ruin the rating system."
1,legends upset,its rubbish just get wwf smackdown 3 : just bring it its well better it 5 stars u get 72 types of matches on legends u only get 12!!!!!!
2,what?,"When I saw the LOW promo on tv making fun of certain wwf champions, I had to pick it up. Blood is a plus, season mode is a plus, but this game should of been strictly for gameboy or something. A combination of all the smackdown games with this would of been pretty good. I think THQ made their season mode so short for jbi just to be smartasses. We did complain about sd2 season mode enough. But this game is in no way better than any smackdown. Sabu and RVD our badasses but when did they become legends?"
2,"Good Concept, Bad Game","This game would be every old school wrestling fans dream, if it was good enough to be called a game. The Roster is outstanding, with the likes of RVD, Sabu, Hogan, Bret Hart, etc... But the game play is slow and sluggish and very difficult to play. I like to have fun playing wrestling games, not straining my thumbs to pull off a lousey move. Very slow paced, Very cheaply made. If you want a good wrestling game, play WWF No Mercy."
3,"ah it's ok, sort of disapointing","Was very excited when I first heard about this game and couldn't wait to get it but isn't that great. The finisher moves aren't as easily done as they claim in booklet for it. I still can't do them actually. Plus it doesn't have none of the special features that were rumored for it. There's no Scaffle match, no barbwire match and nothing you might of heard about. Plus most of the guys on the game never even feuded with each other. Can't have a game with Legends without guys like Ric Flair, Austin, Sting, Luger, Zbysco, Vader, Rhoades and many of the other names that are missing either. Most of the wrestlers in it were never really maineventers either, half of them a mid-carders actually. Too many of the wrestlers do most of the same moves too. Probably the best things about the game is the season mode and the graphics. Other than that it's no Smackdown: Just Bring It. Acclaim shows that they at least improved a little, hopefully they'll get it right sooner or later."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"So Acclaim revamps the engine and gets old school cred, but it still sucks. The 40 some odd wrestlers from the ""golden"" years are really some 20 some with another 20 to be unlocked through gameplay. the problem with this = game play is not good. the wrestlers are slow and methodical with only really four real moves per character. the ""revolutionary"" combo move system means you can pin the opponent after you suplex him, i for one am amazed. the camera doesn't always follow your man, and a health meter makes the game predictable and boring unlike ""real"" wrestling. tagging out is very difficult as well as climbing the turnbuckles for an aerial assualt. either stick with THQ or find an old arcade with Mat Mania still hangin around, but don't give acclaim any more money."
3,It's ok!! >_<,All I wanted were cheap headphones and that's what I got. They work just fine but you can tell they are made of cheap plastic. So if you are looking for good headphones this product is definately not for you. But otherwise they work just fine. ^o^
4,An intriguing study of a spooky subculture,"This book is a natural page-turner which delves into the rise of a new ""warrior cult"" in the U.S. beginning in the mid-70's and gaining momentum in the 80's. Explores the (sometimes dangerous) sociological implications of this fascination with automatic weapons, camouflage clothing, violence, and the ""lone warrior"", although the author's reliance on Jungian and Freudian interpretations of this phenomenon goes a bit overboard at times. Nonetheless this is a valuable study overall. The assertion that this phenomenon is fulfilling a valid psychological need in its adherents, and suggestions of alternate ways of fulfilling these needs that do not glorify violence, should prove to be provocative and hopefully useful in working toward a less violent society."
1,"Great idea, poor execution","The jaws of the cutter don't line up, making it impossible to cut wires. And the stripper end doesn't have enough grip to grab the wire sufficiently enough to work properly."
2,I like these Cutter Strippers.,"If you do a lot of control work these are great. I have both the 26 to 16 ga and the 14 to 10 ga cutters. I would have given them 5 stars but the handle design makes the larger one hard to use unless you have large hands. I took the second star because I thought they were American made but it turned out they were made in china.Update: 1/10/2013 I decided I had to take another star (down to 2 stars), I tried to used the 14 to 10 ga. stripper on solid wire and it wouldn't strip the wire."
5,Sexy,"Probably the best word to describe One Word Extinguisher is ""sexy"" this album is perfect for a round of sweet love making.While placed firmly in the Glitch Hop genre, this album doesn't sound like many of the other ""Aphex Twin + Hip Hop"" outfits in the scene right now. The incredibly warm production just lets the many blips and bleeps swirl around your head engulfing you in the sound. The perfect example of this is the song ""Storm Returns"" a track that is both somber, beautiful, and atmospheric, but also has a groove that will catch your attention and won't let go.This album is just hard for anyone to hate. It's fun, yet intellegent; easy to listen to, but deep at the same time."
5,Oooh YEah!,"Maybe it is the mood I'm in right now but this is the best CD ever! a perfect follow up, I think it just gets better and better. Much like life, which is sweeter and sweeter when you are crankin' up these jamz. YESS!"
3,Lightweight Comedy,"This is a film that's hard to dislike but it's hard to recommend particularly at it's prohibitive price tag. Essentially, it's the cinematic equivalent of a Chinese meal which is to say easily forgettable. Some sporadic chuckles but not that many. Susan Saint James and Peter Fonda do make an engaging screen couple, though. If you can get this one as a rental do so."
5,peter fonda and susan st. james take it on the lam and find a hit song,i just saw this movie again and i have to say it's very good. peter fonda is a much better actor than everyone thinks. he also has his fathers easy going charm and isn't as shrill as his sister.sadly he has been stuck in low budget movies for so long that we forget how good he is.outlaw blues starts in huntsville prison texas where fonda is doing time and writing songs. enter james callahan as a johnny cash type who goes to the prison to make an album.fonda plays the title tune and is blowen of by callahan. weeks later the prison hears fondas song on the radio but it's callahan who is singing it and taking all the credit for it. fonda get out of jail and goes to set things right.in the fight that follows fonda shots callahan by mistake and the chase is on.fonda and st. james make a great screen couple and the movie is really fast paced and fun. a great way to spend some rainy sunday afternoon
3,******BE VIGILANT*******,The products arrived and they are of reasonable quality. However I have had to pay additional charges as there is additional duty which you need to pay on all clothing over the value of $39...the additional charges have come to approx $25 which is a split to the inland revenue and the royal mail. BE VIGILANT when ordering goods!
2,Nice idea but...,"The design of this mirror is a good idea, but is downplayed by cheap parts and construction. It suctions onto a counter top or mirror, but does not stay adhered. The telescoping arm does not stay up because of the weight of the mirror. Also, the mirror appears to be plastic rather than glass, and distorts some. May be a good travel companion as it is compact when folded, but not good for every day use. Way overpriced for the quality."
5,Ipod shuffle is great,This product is amazing ! The clip allows you to clip the ipod to your shirt or pocket and you can easily transfer your cd music or downloads from the internet. The shuffle feature mixes the songs so its like having your own private radio station. Good music quality and it only has to be recharged after about 15 hours of use. This is the neatest product I have purchased in a long time. I use it to work out and I'm working out a lot longer since I'm always listening to great music. Well worth the money. The only drawback to this product is you have to watch what accessories you buy since most are geared toward the generation one products.
5,Great for workout,"I bought this for work out and because it's lighter than the iPod video.Pros:It has a very long battery life.Very light, and easy to use.Cons:The earplugs don't stick well.You need a computer to charge it, but as the battery lasts enough that's not a problem.I have experimented some issues with the syncing, just disconnect and reconnect again.You have to carry the special dock to charge/sync."
5,Music!!,Great to take with me and I can hide it on me. It is nice not to have to change the disk or tape.
4,I love this one,The I-Pod shuffle is very compact to carry. The clip provided is so useful so that it can be be attached anywhere. The sound quality is very good and no other player can beats this.It has a very good battery back up and last for me for 12-14 hrs. The only thing I hate about all the i pods are the way the songs are being uploaded. I-Tunes has to be installed and through that only the songs have to be uploaded in that.
5,pretty fabulous,i wasn't really an i-pod fan untill i saw this piece of art. considering the awesome sound quality for that size... its crazy.
4,Worth every penny!,"I love this gadget!! Its very easy to follow and set up. The only thing I hate is the ear buds, they fall out of my ears all the time and its not the most convenient to be running or walking with it and holding the ear buds in, looks a bit strange. If the earphones were made to fit inside the ear like a hearing aid, it may work better. I replaced the earphones the 1st day of trying it out. Other than that, I love my pink shuffle!"
3,Apple 1gb ipod shuffle 2nd gen,"This is 2nd flash mem mp3 player and my first ever ipod. In general I like the design of this fine piece of machinery. It's very small, sleek, sound quality is decent, and it seems to be somewhat robust. I would give this product five stars hardware wise, but what I don't like about it compared to other flash mem players such as creative or sandisk is the fact that the user interface (I-Tunes) is really not that user friendly. Being mainly a PC based user using win-xp I really liked the idea of the drag and drop of files without a program such as creative or sandisk players allow, but this player does not allow you to do it with-out Itunes. Itunes seems to run really slow compared to creatives' media source player and I've found it difficult to set up a single ipod to add songs from several computers."
4,So easy a Six year old can use it,"OK, I gave in and purchased an IPOD for my six year old for Christmas. She loves it. Not a major investment for a child, but one that will last for some time. Use of the device is simple and loading the machine using Itunes only takes seconds. Sound output is decent. The device is rugged and withstands the beating only a child can give it. The clip on device is a nice touch.If you don't want to carry your whole song catalog (5000 songs or more) -- this a good value and product."
3,"Cute, but has some battery issues.","The Ipod shuffle is very chic. Its small, easily portable, and clips to clothing. The 1 gb version has plenty of storage for your songs. I mean honestly, how many songs can you listen to at any given time? I bought thisipod for my GF, but less than 3 weeks later, it died. It wouldn't turn on despite trying all the steps outlined in the troubleshooting FAQ on their website. Thankfully they have great service, and immedietly shipped a brand new ipod shuffle to my GF, after which she sent the old one back to them, free of charge."
2,Not to pleased with how this thing works!,"OK, first off, I have NEVER had such a difficult time downloading songs onto an MP3 player!! You need to be a rocket scientist to figure it out!! My daughter loves it, when we can get songs synced onto it, but it is to confusing and you can only use iTunes to download. The best thing about this product is the earbuds that came with it!! DON'T waste your money."
2,Looks Great - Sounds Bad,"I ordered my i-POD shuffle and got it in a few days without any hassle. It's a nice little item - easy to use and it looks good. However...The sound quality is not what you'd expect - even in a lower-priced player like this. There is very (very) little bass. I went out and bought a reasonably nice ($60) set of headphones thinking that would help. Sadly, that actually exacerbated the problem - it seems the ""muddiness"" of the i-POD's standard headphones helps to compensate for the lack of bass from the unit itself.The device works (though it does take a loooooong time to recharge), it has a very cool form factor...but I wish I'd purchased something else. - I'll call this an $80 learning experience and use the thing until I lose/forget it somewhere. - If you haven't made the purchase, then I strongly recommend looking at other products."
1,sucks,"I got the ipod...it look cute and I was excited. but it didn't come with anything to put the music on it. well, I must have used the wrong program and it wouldn't work, tried to fix it... had download some program to restore it back but it didn't work I was so mad that I sent it back the next day."
5,I pod shuffle,Great product but was very slow arriving for Christmas I received it on 12-24-2006. I was tolf 5 to 7 days for delivery. I ordered it on 12-11-2006.
1,What An OverHyped Piece Of Cheese!!!!!,"Broke on second day!!!!Altogether, I got maybe 2 HOURS use out of it before the ring controls stopped working completely. I can still turn it on & off & pause, but I can't skip selections, or go back, or increase or decrease the volume.After ALL the good things I've heard about these things, it just died. How annoying.If you MUST have an ipod, get the Nano."
1,shuffle problems,"I bought this product from another store. Within 8 months it quit working. The salesperson said they had a lot of problems but I liked its convenience and size so I just got a new one. It too broke within another month. This time the sales person said: what do expect for that money."" Huh? I refused another one and got my money back.Apple 1 GB iPod shuffle Silver (3rd Generation)"
2,"Itunes cannot read contents of ipod, restore, error 1418","I am on my 5th one, Apple stands behind their product and continues to ship me without charge new ones. The little units are handy and this a work around error so can continue to use. Suggest Apple's 2yr Protection Plan. Not the $59 one, instead purchase from the Apple Store their 2yr Protection Plan for the Ipod Nano 2nd Gen and Shuffle 2nd Gen for $39. Also bought an Ipod Nano 2nd gen....no problems and very, very nice."
1,Disposable MP3 player,Don't buy this unless you want to throw it away after the battery is dead. It cost as much to replace the battery as it does for the player. The battery is hard wired in an enclosed MP3 player.
5,LOOOOOVE IT!!!!!,I received my iPod Shuffle within a week of ordering it. It is super easy to use and lasts a long time when in use. It is perfect for working out and my nephews love using it.
5,Shuffle Rocks!,"The product is fantastic! Not much bigger than a postage stamp, yet with great storage. I use it at the gym to listen to recorded books.Easy to operate, great audio quality. It can be clipped to a sleeve or collar and operated with one finger. Holds hundreds of songs that can be listened to sequentially or randomly. Easy to upload or delete contents.I love it...but still can't believe it."
5,Love this!,This tiny load of tunes clips on my headband and keeps me running happy for the whole marathon!
4,"excellent product, but not designed for 'old' people..","absolutely incredible sound and capacity for a player the size of a paper clip! my only complaint is that until you familiarize yourself to the positions on the control, it's impossible with my old eyes to see what you are hitting, and i was constantly hitting the off button when i wanted to adjust the volume...."
5,Apple 1GB iPod Shuffle (2nd Generation),"Have been enjoying my Shuffle. First product of its kind I've owned, but could figure out how to download music and operate pretty easily. I use it when I go to the gym, and love the 'clip' feature."
2,never got it,"I never received the product. It was shipped by the merchant.,and delivered to the Post Office but not to me. I called Amazon and received a refund immediately."
4,Aplle 1 GB iPod Shuffle,"Sweet, Simple and extremely light weight. The only disadvantage is, you don't have a screen :)"
4,generation 2 ipod shuffle,I like this version better than my 4th generation. It has an easier clip to use than the fourth and it easily displays the chosen songs.
3,Alright I guess...,"Sometimes it syncs and sometimes it doesnt its very not very reliable. I dont mind scratches and scuffs because all i am going to do it beat it up too, but I do expect it to work for me when I need it to."
1,Don't buy this!,This item showed up without headphones or charger. It was dented (which I wouldn't have cared so much about since it was pretty cheap) and it will not hold a charge or play the music that is on it! To make matters worse the company has yet to get back to me in regards to all of these issues.
4,Good Buy,"Very portable, very user friendly interface (both on the player itself and interfacing between the computer and the player), durable and able to hold about 250 songs. In general a good product. The only reason that the product is not given five stars is that it could use a better/more durable clip on the back. The one that it has is nice but could be a little tougher."
1,Defective By Design,"Could not get this to work on my PC. Tried everything Apple recommended (for a week). Still nothing. Actually returned it, and I expect a partial refund (minus shipping costs)."
3,Lacking bass.,If you're picky about sound quality and about bass on your audio then stay away from this one. The size and price compromise too much of the audio quality and I'm dissapointed at apple for letting this one slide. Thank God I just bought this iPod as an alternative for when going to the gym.
2,No Juice- **improved**,"I wanted to like this so much, & some things i can't complain about the sleek look, the clip, the size & battery life- all very good. [[**IGNORE THIS However the volume is bad. It doesn't play as loud as the older shuffle, & if I am getting drowned out on subway car or city street, then Apple did a bad job. I'd happily trade back some size for a little more muscle in this thing.**]] I found that i had checked ""enable sound check"" in the settings, which in the end reduced overall volume. Unclicked it & I am a believer again."
2,apple has it cheaper,"right now you can get Apple 1 GB iPod Shuffle AAC/MP3 Player Metal (2nd Generation) that is refurbished (but with 1 full year apple warranty) so whats there to lose? if it breaks in 6month, just go claim the warranty it is a great product but since there is 3rd generation out, i suggest a lower price would be efficient to selling this product"
2,"Moody, does not 'shuffle', and incompatible with ITUNES","I have been using one of these for my workouts and when I am out on mission (think Iraq) for a couple months now; the sound quality is good, and the battery life is truely great. However, one day it is willing to play a file, the next day I load the same file onto it and it refuses to play it. The pattern seems to be based on file types, so if you want anything to play reliably, you will need the files to be copied into probably about three different formats.There is no shuffle feature. I have tried everything, heck there is not even a fast forward feature that would be a lifesaver.And Itunes cannot load music onto it... I have tried everything right up to redownloading itunes and restalling it three different times. I still like itunes for shorting my music files, but that is all it can do.The one redeeming factor is it does not waste battery power with visual features such as a screen."
4,Apple 1 GB iPod Shuffle,"I think this is a good product for the price. Easy to use, simplistic features and easy to operate. My only complaint is that the product does not offer controls for bass or treble levels and the music I have downloaded tends to be a little ""tinny"". I wish the iPod offered controls for baas and treble but it doesn't. Overall though, I would rate the product very well, in particular with respect to ""bang for your buck"" category."
5,Great product,"I bought this one for my husband, I have a green one I bought for myself simultaneously. They are awesome, basically weightless yet hold so much music for the size and are way more functional with the built in clip."
5,Another great iPod from Apple,"I bought a new orange Shuffle yesterday so that I'd have an iPod that synced with my iTunes library at work. I loaded it up, and immediately everone that saw me with it clipped to my shirt stopped me and just had to look at it.It's:Super smallHas great soundIs amazingly simple and quick to set up- about five minutes from opening the box to listening to a random mix of music.I just love it. It does what it's meant to do perfectly- play a random mix of your music and not get in the way. It will be great for exercising.I'll also download various podcasts for the commute to work. With 1GB of memory, it can fit your latest favorite podcasts in addition to music.Another great Apple product. Their products rock, and are well worth the money. Highly recommended."
5,Ipod Shuffle,I already own an ipod shuffle. I liked it so much I bought this one for my sister for her birthday.
5,Great for the gym,"At first I was looking at other mp3 players for the gym that had a screen but I decided this would be better...and it is! I love that it clips to my shirt, instead of some bulky armband, and I can just push the button to scroll through the songs without looking. Very simple, perfect for when I'm on the go or at the gym."
5,Great for running,"This tiny little thing is the greatest thing for running. I used to have to strap my larger iPod onto my arm or carry it in my hand. This is practically weightless and clips on to clothing and doesn't let go. I just love it.Sometimes it seems like it gets into a cycle of playing the same 30 or 40 songs, but if I switch from random playing to playing in order it sort of resets it."
5,Just what I expect,excellent product the sound quality is great and it store more than enought. its so small that fix anywhere and the controls are easy to use
4,Mary's Review,After a couple of trys in purchasing MP3's I finally bought this iPod Shuffle and it has been a great little iPod for my grandson. He loves it!
5,Cute and Love it,I love this thing. I brought mine a week ago and I cant get enough of it. Its lightweight and less hassle since my pockets are already filled with a cellphone and wallet. I love this thing because I dont really listen to songs unless they are in shuffle mode. I didnt like the first generation shuffle and im glad I waited.I brought mine at Apple Homepage. Its the same price w/free shipping and free engraving. Amazon doesnt seem to have it yet so if you really want it now I suggest Apple Homepage ;]. Its only $79.99
5,Awesome,I just got mine from Bestbuy its all you can expect from a 79$ no frills attached MP3 player that plays beautiful music with solid design and controls
5,Packs a lot of music into tiny package ...,"This is about the 5th iPod I have purchased. This one was a birthday present for the wife, who loves it. Extremely lightweight and handy, perfect for clipping to your clothes while you work out or do mindless chores around the house. It holds 200+ songs in a featerweight package. Cost is reasonable and easy to use. Elegant in its simplicity!"
2,Poor Sound Quality. Treble set too high and damaging to eardrums,"I was very disappointed with the sound quality; in fact, it seems to be hyper-tweaked for treble and base, and the two overpowering settings and opposing qualities pierce your ears. The treble is so high it actually is a bit dangerous and could increase longterm hearing damage. It is really important to consider equalizing music for clarity (keeps volume levels down) and for hearing safety. I love dance and hip hop so this shuffle is so not for me. It's price tag is also too high for being a step back from the original shuffle. I am confused? I love the size, but it doesn't hold the quality that 79$ can get you these days and I am not willing to risk my hearing on bad sound quality. Good Luck!"
4,Have you see the screen? mine is missing,"Very good sound , small size, good design, look cool, but... and this is a very big but, it does not come with a screen at all, I think that the geniuses of apple can put a small screen if they want it to, but apparently they think that the user don't need a screen, but at least in my case they got it wrong because I really like to search for my songs"
5,Tiny Tunes,"I don't see any issues with this product even though I'm not a big Apple fan. Purchased this to use at the gym - small size and sturdy clip work great on the sleeve and don't get in the way of my workout. Original headphones lack in bass response unless you can insert the whole bud in your ear (NOT practical), but an investment in a better pair is a small price to pay unless you want to go with a bigger music player. Otherwise, this thing ROCKS!!"
5,Sweet Little Music Player!,"I love the iPod shuffle!!! For me, it couldn't be more perfect - small, holds 250 songs and mixes them up. It's truly all I need. I'm not into watching TV or Movie on a tiny screen, and I honestly don't need multiple play lists. I wear my Shuffle when I work out and when I go walking with the dog, or do yard work. The ease of use, and the combination of iTunes with it, makes it perfect for those, like me, who want great music, in a small package."
5,Music On the Go,"These electronic beauties are not just a new wave, but a total dream for a music lover. iPods are used everywhere and can store an awful lot of music. People of all ages use them everyday! They're easy to use and fill your ears with music for a long time. Now they come in colors and are so very small.Sales skyrocket and I don't question why. Now, as ipods become more popular and more trendy, I defiantly support anyones decision to buy it. I recommend them for all ages, and hope you are as satisfied as I am."
2,The cradle is dumb,"The first generation shuffle had a simple USB connector. You could carry it anywhere, charge it anywhere, sync it anywhere. It was a thumb drive as well as a music player. Brilliant.This one is smaller. That's nice. However, Apple has introduced yet another proprietary patented connector. It's their's, they have a patent, you pay extra for adapters. You need to give up yet another USB port and add yet more clutter to your desktop. You have to take it with you when you travel.There's no audio-out from the cradle, btw. So don't expect to listen and charge.If they'd used a mini-USB connector I'd have given this shuffle four or five stars. Instead, I'm tempted to give it a single star, but it's not 100% worthless.Boo-hiss Apple. You've always been greedy, but this time you've gone too far."
4,A lot of music in a little package,"It's amazing the amount of music you can download and the sound quality. However, it's almost a little too small (I liked the size of my 1st Generation Shuffle better). When I go to move it around at the gym, I'm constantly hitting the ""Pause"" button or the ""Fast Forward/Fast Rewind"" buttons. But those are little things. It's still great for working out."
4,my first IPOD,"i've been actually using this IPOD for a couple of days, i can say is that this is a great product, i would prefer to syncronize it with windows media player 11, one thing to know is that you can only syncronize it with an itunes on only one PC, if you go to another pc to add more music it will ask you to erase the music that you already have, maybe it's because i'm still getting use to it but that's a little bit uncomfortable for me."
5,Great for working out,Light functional and easy to use and just over all a great MP3 Player for active people.
3,cannot sync with podcast,"It's tiny, it's pretty, it's cool.The only downside as I see it: it cannot sync with itunes to update podcasts. You have to do this manually. Given that it's supposed to be portable, this is just a huge design flaw. I use it for workout, but having to spend 15 minutes to drag podpasts to it manually every time I use it is such a huge pain. I think I'll have to get another ipod that can sync."
2,ITUNES SUCKS!,"Shuffle 1 GB and sleek design got it.itunes is absolutetly the worst thing ever. they keep telling me to upgrade and it never does what i want. Do you want to load a CD. No. Then it does anyway. Puts tracks in the wrong order. Impossible to manage. It actually got erased from my comp and when reinstalled itunes and loaded the shuffle into the USB it tells me I have to seek it with the current library, which is empty and everything gets erased.i got the shuffle for free but will never buy an apple product ever, let the rest of the lemmings look cool jumping off a bridge i'm sticking to my cell mp3."
3,Step back,I liked the first generation iPod shuffle better. It was small enough and it could be used as USB flash drive without carrying shuffle specific USB cable. I do not see single advantage of second generation iPod shuffle over the first one.
3,wish i had known before buying,"I just got my shuffle today and I wish I had known the following before purchasing: unlike other ipods, you cannot download music from your shuffle to a computer other than your own. Therefore, you cannot transfer songs to a friend's computer, even if you bring along your docking station. I think I might return my shuffle just because of this."
4,Good deal for the $$$$ but....,I'm not in love with the clip style. It needs to clip on the edge of something to feel secure and if I don't have a jacket or a pocket that can be a problem as it doesn't seem to have the reach of the original. But the sound still is great so I'm keepin' it....
5,Excellent!,"Well I already owned an iPod video prior to this one, but it was kinda hard to take it to the gym with me because of its size. I tried the armband, the clip, it's just too big for the gym. so I picked one of these 2nd gen shuffles today and boy am I ever happy. It takes up no room, clips easily, does not skip when I'm running, and sounds excellent. Some have complained about it not having an equalizer, well you don't need it. It sounds good just the way it is. It has plenty of bass--when I play it in my car (aux) it bumps even just as good as my CDs. I played it through my car stereo via the aux (using monster cable--basically the same set up I use for my video iPod) and it sounds freaking amazing. I highly recommend this item. I love it."
1,Lacks the screen,"This is a rewritten review. I give this product a THREE STARS ***. I am unable to change the stars above. I saw many people reacting to my previous review and I found them somewhat right.The main thing that comes to mind when you hear shuffle is its small size. Seriously, who is interested in a thing that will only play songs randomly? But driven by its size people might tend to forget that it has no screen, and added to that is the fact that it plays songs randomly.This shuffle is an excellent replacement for older shuffle considering size and price. But you will still be required to buy another Ipod with screen for more control(Apple strategy)."
1,Piece of Crap,I am so disgusted with this product. I expected to be able to use it right out of the box but instead I have to wait 4 hours for the stupid thing to charge. It is basically useless until it's charged. I just think Apple should make this thing usable out of the box instead of a dead lifeless piece of crap. I am very disapointed. I didn't buy this so I could sit and wait 4 hours to use it. The battery should already be charged when you purchase it.
2,Hissing sound,"The iPod shuffle second generation is small and stylish however at the expense of sound quality. There is a hissing sound, some sort of noise, that is constant as long as it is turned on. It can be heard with the earphones that comes with it, and is more annoying with better earbuds.I was quite disappointed when I got it. The iPo shuffle first generation (gum-pack version) had great sound quality, but I lost mine so I had to replace it.I would not recommend this to anyone who does not listen to music so loud that they impair their hearing.Also the docking station is a bit annoying, since it makes it harder to recharge the battery and use it as a data-saving source. It is possible to buy a little thing that is more portable than the docking station though, that makes it a bit more convenient."
4,Pretty much what you would expect...,"A good no-frills mp3 player. Ideal for jogging. The metal clip makes cases and arm bands unnecessary. Not really cheap but tolerably priced for the convenience. The Apple ear buds fit well in my big elf-like ears but not my wife's. Any feedback on the Sony headphones with interchangeable earpieces? Say from someone who's about 5'3"" and 110 lbs with normal sized ears?"
4,Amazing for it's tiny size....,"If you want something super small to bring with you to listen to your music while at the gym or while out running or walking, this is ideal."
2,Waste of Money,This tiny Ipod is too small to be of any real use.There is no display so you are guessing what is playing.Apple iPod shuffle 1 GB Metal (2nd Generation)
5,WOW!,"OMG...How much do I love this little thing! Even after I dropped it on the tread mill, stepped on it and flung it back like 6', it works perfect. Very well built for something so small. Anyway, I see a lot of reviewers complaining about the battery life, and the lack of special features(like screens, radio, ect) but do you guys not realize the purpose of a shuffle. It spouse to be small, compact and not complicated. If your looking for features like those spend the extra money and get your self a 30gb ipod. But if your looking for something to take with you on runs, or when you just need a little music entertainment, this is what you need. I my self have a Nano and the shuffle, and seem to use the shuffle a lot more then the nano, I say the simpler, the better, and simple does go hand in hand with the shuffle!"
3,"Great product, but not designed for the runner.","The clip has no grip strength at all. if you run on a treadmill at the gym, it falls off your shirt sleeve in less than 5 minutes. Be warned."
5,Great product.,"I love my iPod shuffle! I originallly bought this to work out at the gym and was amazed at how good the sound quality was. Now I take it with me on walks and even working in the yard. I especially like the size. It's perfect and I would not change anything on it, though I see some people have complained about the ear buds. For me they're fine and for $80.00 you can't go wrong."
5,"Love it, love it, love it!","Did I mention that I love this petite little player. I wanted something teeny to workout with that I wouldn't have to worry about getting in the way. I can just clip this to my shirt or shorts and go. I must say that it is very durable for such a tiny thing. Last week my dog knocked it off of my swim suit into the pool...I watched in complete distress as it sunk to the bottom, and thought well there goes my perfect little player. My dad pulled it out, and I dried it off hoping that it would be ok and can you believe it, it still worked perfectly. I am in awe!"
4,"Excellent product, mediocre sound","This ipod is very nice with a solid, high quality construction. It is unbelievably small and the controls are intuitive. I love going to the gym with it.The sound is not as good as one would expect. The bass is not much and the sound not is not crisp. It sounds better with my Sennheiser headphones but my PDA (which of course is not primarily designed for music) still outperforms it. It comes with low quality earphones which keep coming out of my ears when I work out. This is a big problem because the ipod shuffle must have been designed for the gym crowd. These are the only things making it less than perfect. Otherwise a fine product and I dont regret buying it."
2,"Great idea, but not durable...Bad Battery","Great size sound and clip, but if you are planning on using this often get something else. Battery won't hold a charge after 3 months of use. Apple makes great gadgets that last until there next product launch..."
4,great product for the money,"The ipod shuffle is a great product. It has a very crisp, clear sound. It comes with its own docking station and is very easy to use. Just plug it in to a USB port, and you are quickly adding songs and charging the ipod as well. The only thing this ipod does not have is a display screen. Just memorize the order in which you add the songs. You can also coose the shuffle mode to play your songs. When you want to stop listening for a while- pause the song first, then turn off the ipod- when you turn it back on later- hit play, and it will start back at the same song. You will not have to scroll all the way through it just to get back to the same song. This is a really great product for just a little bit of money."
4,Apple 1 GB ipod Shuffle (Blue),"I was a hold out for an MP3 player, but my husband and two children had been using ipods for the last couple of years. I had been used to carrying around a cumbersome CD player for a long time, and who needed 4000 songs anyway?Then...along comes the cute little quarter size ipod shuffle! I was apprehensive about being able to use my husband's music list (we use the same computer) but there was no problem. I created my own playlist from his library and downloaded my songs from there!I downloaded my songs yesterday, and voila, I was up and running. Walking with it, that is! Now if they would only invent something I can attach to it so I don't misplace it like I do my keys..."
5,My first IPOD...,"I didn't think I would join the IPOD movement and then came along the IPOD shuffle, the 2nd generation. Actually, I purchased two directly through the Apple store because the shipping and engraving was free. The highlights for me are, the shuffle is: compact, lite-weight, and easy to use. Do you really need more than 240 MP3 files? If so, this is not the IPOD to get."
4,great ipod for exercise,"I would give this 5 stars but for a few things:- the included earbuds are uncomfortable and fall out of my ears duringexercise- syncing is sometimes buggy- you have to load all podcasts manually- podcasts seem to be ordered by date on the player, no matter how youarrange them in iTunesRecent releases of iTunes have solved some, but not all, of the sync issues. Also, I have read about some workarounds for the podcast ordering problem, but they involve rebuilding your library, and furthermore from what I've read they're just temporary fixes. Apple needs to fix this.Still, the small form factor, cool design, and easy-to-use controls make this a great product. I sold my 4G 40GB iPod right after I got this, and I have no regrets."
5,New Shuffle Flawless,"If you want a small mp3 player with big sound, the Shuffle is the best ever. Perfect design and function."
5,This little sucker is too cool for school!,"I love this thing. I don't care that there's no readout - the thing is the size of a friggin stamp! I know what songs I have on it - I don't need to be reminded. Only problem is specific to me: I'm color blind so I have NO idea what color the little light is blinking. I'm used to being clueless when it comes to idiot lights, so this doesn't bother me - especially because this thing fits in my watch pocket!"
5,From someone who has never liked iPods...,"...this is honestly the best piece of consumer electronics I've purchased in a while. Honestly, most generations of the iPod are grossly overrated and overpriced, but this is perfect. No superfluous features, and extremely user friendly. Nothing compares to the size and weight of this thing...you can clip it to your sleeve and forget it's even there.The only thing that could improve this would be to remove the need to use iTunes to transfer music, but I enjoy the random song loading function, so it's a fair trade."
3,Apple 1 GB iPod Shuffle AAC,Great little player. The only draw back is the interface. iTunes leaves a lot to be desired. I am not a light weight when it comes to this stuff and I've used other interfaces but have never run into something so cumbersome.
1,ipod shuffle 2nd generatioon is NOISY,"If you use any higher quality headphones than the ones that came with the shuffle, be prepared to be disappointed. When you turn the shuffle on, without any music playing, you will hear a background noise which gets even louder during music playback. In Apple's user forum on the Apple website a lot of users are noticing this problem as well.I took my shuffle into an Apple store and the only response I get is ""I can't hear the noise"" so the people in the store refused to do anything about it.I've owned many iPods. I've never had a problem before, but the first time I have a problem Apple refuses to do anything about it. I think they've lost a customer completely."
1,Big on Hype - Small on Performance,"Bottom line - there are far better mp3 players out there for the same money. Don't buy this one.. keep looking. This player REQUIRES the use of iTunes meaning that one can't just drag and drop music into the player. This means installing this bulky virus/software and waiting for it load each time you want to monkey with your music. Also, you'll be forced to use only one computer to manage you music. This concept is completely dim-witted and annoying.Also, the player does not have simple, but vital, functions like ""hold"" or any kind of on-the-fly file management.Get something else that has drag-and-drop file management (sorry, that means non-Apple) and last longer than a year."
3,Apple 1 GB iPod Shuffle (2nd Generation),"The Shuffle is simple to use and the gadget itself rates 5 stars. The size and design of this thing couldn't be better... it's just fun and draws a lot of comments. You can load this thing up with two complete audiobooks and have room to spare.As a first-time user, however, I'm totally unimpressed with the iTunes software which you'll need to learn if you want to load that cool lil shuffle. The iTunes documentation (including its integrated help) is maddening. It is absolutely terrible at describing detailed options. For instance, what is a compilation, what's the advantage of checking it? How does one import an audiobook? Be prepared to do some web surfing if you want to learn the useful features. It's as though it's intended that you learn from someone else."
3,Not what I needed for podcasts,"I listen to podcasts more than music. I wanted an easy way to synch podcasts to listen to while I work out in the yard. I can do this in a bunch of steps (plug in Shuffle, delete current contents on Shuffle, drag and drop all podcasts into shuffle, wait for half a gig to update), but really wish I could do this in no steps (plug in Shuffle, magically update podcasts)."
4,Super Small and nice,"The clip makes this unit really easy to use, it can clip to part of your clothes or to something around you like a seatbelt.The fact it doesnt have a screen is no big deal you can just thumb to the the next song anytime...I updated this review == I am happy the battery life is still good after several months of use."
4,great little ipod,"Great ipod for the price, hold a good deal of music and is very easy to walk, exercise etc."
5,Cute and Convinent,This was the perfect piece to use for working out. It holds more than enough songs and it is easy to keep up with than my 30gig
5,Excellent product,I purchased this Ipod for my 6 years of age niece-it was refurbished but in excellent conditions like new. I love the shuffle-overall I am very stistied with the purchase
5,I don't know,Would real babies be wearing this? no. but yet it is very cute. It is weird that baby bratz have big heads how do they stand with out falling and hitting your foot?
1,Parabens?!,"I love how they preach ""natural care"" and state how there is Vit. E and Aloe in there, but they ""forget"" to mention it contains parabens.Are you serious?!? I know there are parabens in almost everything (sadly, even most baby products), but wipes? Really??Not only that, but they're just not a good feeling wipe. They're thick, yes, but it's a feeling I don't like. They just don't clean well."
1,Huggies wipes miss the mark,"I'm a fan of Huggies diapers, but their wipes are a different story. On the plus side, they are thick. However, they're not very soft - in fact, I find them fairly rough. They also aren't as moist as other wipes I've tried. Worst of all, though, is how hard they are to pull apart. These non-popup wipes tend to clump together and pull out in a lump of 5-10 wipes at a time - definitely NOT what I want when I'm holding a squirming baby on the changing table and trying to clean up a mess quickly at the same time. Once I use up the two packages I bought on sale, I'm going back to Pampers wipes."
1,Too dry and linty,I was very unhappy with these wipes. They are much drier than other brands and leave lint pieces on my daughter's skin. I would not recommend these wipes at all.
3,So-So,"This book really is not much more than a glorified collection of word lists. I used it to make note cards and learned the vocab that way without referring back to the book again. Not a bad book, just not really an effective method of learning."
4,Mastering Italian Vocuabulary (a thematic approach),"This was an excellent companion book for my casual study of Italian. It is somewhat similar to a travel ""phrase book"", yet is has more comprehensive applications of grammar and colloquial speech for all occasions. Included is an excellent verb conjugation ""breakdown"" chart and a highly relevant glossary at the end of the book. Having studied 2 other romance languages formally in college, this book to me was reminiscent of an indispensable auxiliary learning guide for second (or even third) year language students."
5,positive personal experience,"Having spent considerable time teaching in China, I have personal experience of the amazing relief that Golden Throat lozenges bring to throats that are sore or irritable, in preventing or reducing coughing, and for clearing the sinuses. I always made a point of bringing home a good supply to last me until my next trip but, now I am retired, I am pleased to find that they can be obtained in the US. I am constantly passing some on to friends in need and they all agree with me on the results."
3,Can be read by the layperson,"The bottom line is Lawrence Krauss has been able to give us a glimpse of an open, fascinating problem in physics which is far from being solved: the existence and essence of dark matter. The book can be read by the layperson but is also useful for scientists, non-specialists in cosmology. Pedro G. Ferreira, OxfordA complete review is availabele in CERN Courier, June 2000"
3,Too dense for the lay reader,"I've read many books on physics, and several written by Krauss. But this book is entirely too dense for the lay reader. Worst yet, Krauss seems to have lost his magical touch for keeping the reader's interest. Unless you're a professional (or student) of quantum physics, this book will bore you."
4,DOESN'T COME WITH A PURSE!,Just received two of these and they did not come with a purse or carrying case as described in the title and description. Am very disappointed by this misrepresentation!
4,ummmmmmmmmm,oh gee no one has Reviewd this yet well thats the only resun i am right now but i do like''zoegirl'' a bit there not bad and thay have good words there not the best group i'v herd but if you like the first cd you should get this one or if you like this one or just get the cd when you have the mony or what ever if you like this kind of music ohya there music is teenpop from pepole in there 20's? .
5,I really liked this CD!,This is a great CD.It's even better than their last one.Their songs and lyrics are really cool.If you like pop music you'll really like this CD!
4,Conrad Schnitzler - 'Blau' (Marginal),"Originally released in 1974,this was Schnitzler's second album and his follow-up to 'Rot'(see my review).Probably considered(by most)to be about as good.Like 'Rot',this CD reissue has just two tracks.""Die Rebellen Habe Sich""(19:00)and ""Jupiter""(20:00).Both these cuts serve their purpose well.Think I may own one other title of this Tangerine Dream/Kluster's lengthy repertoire co-founder,but I can't seem to find it.Maybe later.A decent vintage krautrock piece of work."
5,Classic Con,"Blau was one of his legendary albums long out of print, now back as a CD (some versions of this CD are limited to 1000 copies). Excellent electronic noodling from the classic 70's era. Dark, mysterious and creepy in a sci-fi atmosphere. Con had a completely different way of playing compared to Klaus Schulze and Edgar Froese although he came from the same back ground. He was more robotic sounding but with an eerie sci-fi feel to it. Really great stuff."
5,Great Product,Saved my hydroponics' plant's lives several times... I wouldn't grow without it anymore ... Nothing more to really say ...
3,Nothing but water?,"The image of the label says the bottle contains 3.78 liters and that the net weight is 3.66 kg. That is the equivalent of 3780 milliliters and 3660 grams, respectively. Anyone familiar with the metric system knows that 1 ml of water weighs 1 gram. So, if the bottle contained nothing but water it would weigh 3780 grams or 3.78 kg.How Botanicare can get a bottle containing heavy elements such as calcium, magnesium, and iron to weigh less than water is a mystery to me!!"
2,Not much here for me,"Because of the excellent reviews on this page, I ordered this book. But I was disappointed. The ""revelation"" that God is living and experiencing through us, and the advice that we should always be ourselves, just doesn't do it for me. I was just hoping for something heavier, something to connect with me on a deeper level. I was hoping for some revelations that would make me think. Nope, not here."
2,New Testament with an eastern flair,"This isn't a particularly bad book to read, there are worse, but I agree with a previous reviewer in that there's not much new. You can get that same messages by going right to the source, the Bible, or attending sermons by a good minister. So my recommendation is go to church! This book also has an annoying quality that is common to many modern religious ""spiritual"" texts, which is the practice of cramming all sorts of oriental philosophy into western religious themes. Maybe just a pet peeve of mine but it's been going on since the 60s and there are books that haven't been adulterated in this way, see Billy Graham's writing for the best example."
3,"BE yourself, only than will you be able to give of yourself.","But what is your true self? It will take a lifetime to discover your true self. When you think you have it together and know your being, someone or something comes into your life and shakes it all up. To know what you don't know is the beginning of real growth in the spiritual life. The Road to Damascus gives us a map on how to travel and live in the NOW. ""What you see NOW is what you get"", ""Who you are NOW is who you will be tomorrow."" To be enlightened is to become aware of the NOW. Like Elmer Fudd says ""That's all folks."" We are all in this together, so let us travel and become brothers and sisters and love one another as Jesus loves us."
2,bad quality,"cool shot button doesn't work at all, maybe it is the one i received. Good thing it's cheap, not worth my time to make a return. The low heat setting is enough for me."
5,Pleased with product,"I've had this for over a year now and have found nothing at fault with this armoire. The finish, style and construction are excellent. Does not look cheap at all, and has tons of storage."
1,Cheaply Made,To start with the product was damaged. Instead of sending it back I repaired it myself to reinforce areas that were put together with glue instead of nails. Side doors do not shut like they should. I had to install spacers so that the magnets would come in contact with the doors. It was not shipped in the original packaging which I think is why it was damaged. Poorly packaged. The item overall was of poor quality.
1,Hardware required for assembly not included in the shipment.,I ordered this armoire for my wife for Christmas. Imagine my delight when I unpacked it on Christmas eve and discovered the the hardware required to assemble the product was not included in the box. It required bolts to secure the legs and screws to attach the mirrored lid. Other hardare to secure the product from tipping was also referenced in the assembly instructions. None of the hardware was provided.
5,Beautiful Piece of Furniture,This jewelry armoire is beautiful. The size is perfect if you do not have alot of wall space and it can be close to the wall even with the lid open.
1,Terrible Quality Fit and Finish,"I was extremely disappointed with the poor construction quality in terms of fit and finish. The side doors and top mirror lid did not fit properly after assembly, there were noticeable uneven gaps when the doors/lid were open as well as closed. The finish was terrible. Several areas on the legs were not stained so there was an obvious color difference. Also the wood grain did not uniformly match on the various pieces."
5,wedding gift,This was a wedding gift that the receipients recieved promptly and were very happy with.
2,Pretty piece of furniture,"The armoire is a pretty piece of furniture but smaller than I had expected. Unfortunately, I had to return it. My fault, I should have paid attenion to the measurements."
1,Ordered canceled for no apparent reason (seller review for Visiondecor Furniture),"I ordered this well in advance for a Christmas present, but was informed a week and a half before Christmas Day that my ordered was canceled without explanation. Will NOT attempt to buy anything from Visiondecor Furniture again!"
2,Beware of suspicious reviews!,"I was considering buying this armoire, but after doing some detective work I found that the majority of the 5 star reviews, are those customers only reviews. Very fishy don't you think?"
4,Jewelry Armoire,"My wife really likes her new jewelry box. The finish is really nice and looks like real, solid oak. I think she would have liked to have more hooks for hanging necklaces but there is plenty of space in the drawers. My only complaint with it is the fact that it can't be put flush against a wall. When it is, the doors containing the hanging jewelry will not open as they extend behind the back of the unit. It needs to sit off the wall by two or three inches. Overall, though, this is a really nice, functional piece."
1,Wasnt the quality i expected,I ordered this because it looked real nice and when i opened it the wood on a couple of the drawers were lifted so i was kinda upset. You pay this much you expect better quality.
3,its unsteady,"This jewelry box is unsteady and you must connect it to the wall with the screw provided in the box or it will fall over. However, it is inexpensive in comparison to others. Therefore, it may be worth the money. You get what you pay for."
2,Cherry Jewelry Armoire,"I was disappointed with several aspects of this purchase. First I was told it would be delivered within two weeks of purchase. When the two weeks passed and I did not receive any notification as to a delivery date, I contacted the vendor. I was informed delivery would be delayed for several weeks. I believe the vendor should have notified me there would be a delay before I had to inquire about it. Second, when I finally received the armoire, one of the drawers was falling apart. Fortunately I was able to repair it because it would have been impossible to send it back to have it repaired. This was a disappointing purchase."
1,Not very good quality.,I was very dissappointed with the quality of the jewelry box. The corners were not lined up very well and the screws that came with it to attach the lid were insufficeint. They pulled out of the holes after three lifts of the lid. When I tried to screw them in again the holes were to big and any bigger of a screw will crack the piece altogether.
3,Damaged upon Arrival,The armoire is very nice with minimal assembly required. Sadly when my first unit arrived the top had small chips in the wood and there was a substantial tear on the back. It was a bit odd because there was no damage on the outside and it was packed very well.I cannot say enough about the customer support. They were great in every respect. They had a replacement unit on the way post haste and my wife loves it!!!!
4,glad I ordered early,"I ordered this early for my daughter for Christmas. Glad I did becausewhen I took it out of the box, the front had several chips from the wood.I had to repack it and send it back. I received another one, no chips inthis one but the mirror on the top lid was not sealed to the lid and hada broken corner. It must have been broken before being shipped because themissing piece was not in the box anywhere. So, now I'm waiting for anothermirror that I will have to glue in myself. The armoire is very nice and a goodbuy for the money, the shipping procedure needs to change."
5,a beautiful gift,i sent it to my sister as a birthday present and - she loved it! delivery was just in time and everything else worked out beautifully. i am very pleased with the handling of this order.
4,Faces of America,Knowing your heritage creates a sense of self and where you fit in history. I have so much admiration for our ancestors who paved the way.
1,Bad disc,"I have seen this program on PBS. I purchased it for the library which I run. Unfortunately, prepared it for the shelf without looking at it first. I later found that I had received a bad disc. It skips throughout. I have tried cleaning the disk and cleaning my computer, but with little improvement. I feel I wasted the library's money."
2,before you buy this read,"this movie does not have the same actors as funimation so if you are a fan of funimation i recommend that you do not buy this movie. the actors sound totally different than funimation , not even close. The only thing the same is the plot. That is why I gave it a two star not a one star review."
1,Stretches the limits of value - that's all,Simplistic little brochure that is not worth the cost. Most of the simple and intuitive stretches are already available on line and in numerous free publications. The graphic/pictures are very basic and not that illustrative. Don't buy this. It is a waste of money. Excuse me...maybe at $1.50 it would be useful.
5,A NEW KABBALAH YOGI,"I love this video for all of the same reasons the other person didn't. Finally, a Yoga program where I don't have to listen to the cue'ing over and over again after I've watched this a dozen times and know the program. If this program were so easy that I could do it the first time viewing, why buy it? I don't need to watch or hear cue'ing while I'm doing this program...I can count to 6 (breaths). ALSO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KABBALAH AND YOGA IS ASTOUNDING. THIS DVD GIVES YOU THE TOOLS THROUGH PHYSICAL YOGA POSES TO ACCESS YOUR SPIRITUAL SIDE. THE SPANISH VERSION IS PERFECT BECAUSE I SPEAK SPANISH AS WELL. THE BEST PART...THE MUSIC. JAI UTTAL HAS OUTDONE HIMSELF WITH HIS SONG ""SHALOM"""
3,Filter Wrench - Good to have.,"I purchased these filter wrenches because sometimes filters get tight and are hard to remove with you hand. The Adorama filter wrench works, but has to be expanded to fit a 58mm filter which I found a little clumsy, but I got used to it with a little practice. Good tool to have in your camera bag for when you are in a hurry."
3,"Cheap, and look like they will work like a charm","Not much to say, but they dont look to be made in a way that they will break, and will save me from having fits trying to remove a polarizing filter all the time."
2,"Cheap,",Very cheap product..had it 2 weeks and it broke and I take VERY good care of my equipment....very poorly made.
2,Not very useful,"I thought maybe these would be a good to have in the camera bag, but they are not really doing what I thought they would. First, they are plastic, and do not grip the filter. Second, there is no way they will ever span a 58mm filter without snapping in half.Save your money, and use a rubber jar opener pad from the kitchen supply store."
1,Disappointed,"When up on a 58mm filter it feels like it is about to break, and it doesn't even grip enough to turn the filter."
4,Rubber band solution!,"The circular polarizing filter and adapter were tied together for half a year. I could not separate them as much as I tried (the polarizing filter kept on spinning). In the end I used a wide rubber band and put it around the polarizing filter, so that the polarizing filter could no longer rotate. Then I was able to easily unscrew it from the adapter. I did not try the product above. Perhaps it's also very good, but the rubber band solution could save you time and money."
2,Item didn't fit my camera,Still waiting response to my email from seller about returning the Filter Wrenches. - didn't fit my camera
3,Aun no me ha llegado,Al día de hoy 10 de marzo de 2012 aún no me ha llegado y hace dos meses que lo compré
4,Andis 40055 hair dryer,This hair dryer is smaller than I expected however I am impressed. The sound is not that ear pearcing scream small hair dryers make. The air flow and options are ideal.
5,Great,"I love the blow dryer, I used one like it at the hotel, I stayed in and loved it. So, I serched it and found it at Amazon. Ordered it and love it. Blows hard and it is small."
5,Worth it..,"I have been using this product for nearly a month now. From a guy perspective I think this product is really great. I use this product since my hair is quite long and for some personal reason I don't like to dry my hair using my towel. Anyway, the best thing about this hair dryer is that it dries my hair really fast and also produce low noise. Well, if you use the high air mode, the noise is quite loud but much tolerable than other products I have used. Basically I just used the low air mode since the noise is low and it isn't too hot.Furthermore, when you first use this product, it will have a burning metal smell (like soldering smell). However, after 3-4 times of use the smell will be gone. The smell won't stick on your hair though, so it isn't a big deal. This hair dryer is light which I think is a plus."
3,OK but short life,"I bought three of these a couple of years ago, and they work fine as long as they work. For the price they are almost a ""throw-away"" product. That's because recently two of them have gotten the shakes so I'm afraid to use them, and the last one is going. By the shakes I mean the bearings are probably shot, because the dryer starts to vibrate like it's going to self-destruct and fly to pieces. As long as you know that it won't last over a couple of years, it's an OK product, especially since all you can get in the stores now are those wimpy little propeller jobs that barely blow a breeze. So I'll buy a couple more soon."
2,Wish I would have chosen another hair dryer!,I purchased this hair dryer based on the great reviews but I wish I would have chosen a different one.It dries my hair fairly quickly but if I use it for a few minutes and then shut it off it won't turn back on right away.It seems to overheat and I have to wait a few minutes for it to cool off.(Maybe I just bought a defective unit?) I have never had this problem with other hair dryers.
4,Good deal for the price,"Inexpensive. Lightweight and easy to hold. Blows warm and hot. i was disappointed as it *does not blow cold air*. Not the longest cord so you have to stand close to where you plug it in. Be careful about holding it close to your head as it will sometimes pull your hair if the intake on the sides gets too close! I have shoulder length hair and have to be pretty careful. It does a good job of drying my hair. It's not too loud, after all its a hair dryer!!"
1,Overheated,I bought this dryer last year and loved it. I bought the new generation this year and it simply shuts off and overheats way too soon.
4,good,It has wonderful appearance.I like it so much.It's awesome. And the price is good.The dilivery is fast!
3,Lasted less than a year and a half,"I bought this in April of 2011, and now, in August of 2012, I had to throw it away after several months of erratic behavior. It finally quit working this morning. It was fine, in terms of power and heat and such, though."
2,Andis 1600 Hair Dryer,This hairdryer is lightweight and has very good drying capability. I bought two to have one as a backup dryer. In less than a month both dryers over heated and stopped working. I returned both dryers for a refund.
5,Rgg,"Used this hair dryer in a hotel room. Love it. Lightweight, powerful and most importantly, quiet - much quieter than my current dryer. All in an inexpensive dryer! You can't go wrong."
4,Hard to believe it could be so good,"I bought this dryer based on the user reviews and am very pleased. It has a lot of drying power. It's light. It's quiet. It's nicely balanced. It's not necessary to grip the handle to hold the dryer. It will balance in the crook of your left thumb, so your hand and arm won't get tired from holding it. I can't say for certain, since I don't have carpal tunnel syndrome, but this may be a great dryer for people who suffer from it since there's no need to clinch a fist to hold it. Though I was at first disappointed that I can't remove the screens to clean them (and will need to do it with the vacuum cleaner) I later decided that for price and performance, this is a pretty great dryer."
3,it's ok...,Had this for about two years and the bearings have already started to fail. Makes more noise than when new. It's ok... but not great.
2,Alternative to Obsolete Conair 1600,"I bought the Andis 1600 hair dryer as an alternative to the Conair 1600. The Conair 1600 is now impossible to find anywhere, but I don't like the more up-to-date 1875 watt Conairs as they blow either too hot or too cool. The Andis has four settings instead of two or three on Conair dryers, which provides good heat control. It's very robust and not too heavy.What I didn't know when I originally wrote this review, however, was that it would only last me 8 months."
5,Really great little hair dryer,"I got this to replace a broken cheap Conair. I was torn between getting another Conair with retractable cord or this one. I am glad I chose the Andis (this hair dryer). The cord is much longer than the Conair's was, which means I am not stuck to the wall quite as badly. The airflow is a little less than my old one (on high) which means that I have more control. I would rate the airflow on high as somewhere between a medium and high on most hair dryers, and I like that speed. It seems to dry my hair relatively fast. I am not sorry I bought it. Also, it got here REALLY FAST! I love Amazon Prime."
1,poor quality,"After researching nail clippers on line, I decided that these clippers would probably meet my needs. I have a small bichon. When I went to use them, the spring came loose and the clippers no longer worked. do NOT waste your money."
1,wrong size,"Chart said these would work in my printer, they have a rounded ink hole and ours is more oval an oval shape."
5,Nearly Perfect,"This 'chess book' is so good it is almost philosophy! The examples are fresh, the explanations are lucid and the writing is interesting. I have not a single complaint about this offering. I enjoyed reading it AND my playing strength jumped one hundred points to 2300! Rest assured this work is challenging whatever your ability."
5,enjoyable and instructive,"We are lucky, thanks to this book we can learn chess strategy avoiding to study outdated books like the ones by Nimzowitch and Pachman.Watson tells us which of the old ideas are still good and which are wrong, and then he give us the modern brand new ideas. All in a enjoyable and instructive way, without thousand of boring and not useful variations in every position. Variations like the ones that make Pachman impossible to read."
5,Great Chess Book!!,"Of all the many, many chess books I've read, this is the only one that made me proud to be a chessplayer. This great book is in a class by itself (not for beginners)."
3,Don't see the point,"I don't see the point of this book. Presents bunch of special cases to confirm that general rules are no good. But good players know when to deviate from rules anyway, and beginners need to know the rules first. So, who is this book for?Also, this guy writes way too many books which always seems suspicious to me."
4,A fine book by a fine author,I would have given it a 5 stars. My only problem with the book is sometimes the explanations are too lengthy and complicated.
4,Good book,"This a good book, but like so many other books, Capablanca is dismissed. For example, in Niemzowitch-Capablanca, 1914 Watson say ""I'dont beleive that Capablanca intentionally sacrificed the pawn. It is hardly in his style... "". For the same situation Kasparov say ""a profound concept"". Maybe Watson don't remember Capablanca-Alekhine 1936 where Capablanca make not one exchange sacrifice, Capablanca make two exchange sacrificies and won brillantly!!. Because the computers are now very powerful, we can re-test the modern concepts and see what is right and what is wrong. Maybe we will see that the Capablanca positional concepts are right!! For the first light you can read the Berliner book ""The System"". However, this book is very instructive, because have so many good games played for more than 200 great players categorized by strategic motifs."
2,misleading and written for noise,"the book is devoted to deliver a message, apparently it is commenting about the ""my System"" classic book but I have doubts here.ok, let us stick with what is apparent, the writer dedicated this volume critizing the orginal work by Nimzo for nothing, but I believe to make more value out of his work. You have to read the original work, my sytem, to understand this."
2,Picked Up at the End,"This book was B-O-R-I-N-G for the first half of it. At the end, however it began to pick up speed and get more interesting. I don't know if I'd read another book by Patricia Beatty...frankly, I was releaved to finish the book. Its not a totally BAD book...its just kind of ho-hum."
2,To Bad it didnt fit because it is so cute!,This shipment was very very fast!!!! But the outfit did not fit the way i wanted it to. I am going to keep it but it is not long at all like the picture. It could be because i have more pushin for the cushion in my derriere lol. It sorta fits like a shirt but Im sure my hubby will still have some fun with it :-)
3,Dreams and Healing - a passable book,"Dreams and Healing by John A. Sandford is good, it's help me understand my dreams better, but it relies on psychology too much. I wish Rev. Sandford had used Scripture more in his boook. It would give the book more balance."
5,Purchased this set for my grandaughter.,This set was chosen for my granddaughter who loves to read. She will be able to pass them down to her family.
3,"Great set of Books for kids, however ITEM description posted is MISLEADING and FALSE Advertised!","The books are nice, however the product description posted here is misleading. Would say it's more on FALSE advertising!No PRESENTATION BOX was included in my package when we got the books.The Presentation Box was what made us decide to buy this item here at Amazon, even if I could have bought this to another online store for a cheaper price. So disappointing! You should remove your ads with Presentation Box, as this will affect Amazon's credibility and yours as the Seller of this item.If only I can ship the books back in the USA without spending $65 on the shipping cost, I would surely send the item back and demand for replacement.:(("
2,Beatrix Potter - Peter Rabbit 1-23 Book Set,The books could have been shipped in a better package. Because they were shipped in a flimsy box the presentation box was battered and torn. I was very upset because the presentation box is what holds these books for their lifetime. I asked for a new set and a return label and was told that I could have 20% refund and that's it. I was embarrassed to give this to my sister for her first sons birth. It made a very special gift a little less special.
1,Not as advertised,The books did not come in the presentation box as advertised. The books themselves were in like new condition. They are the same books that my children grew up loving and now my granddaughter will have a chance to experience. If you just want the books go ahead and order if you want the presentation box as advertised then look elsewhere.
5,Excellent service,"Books arrived within seven days of purchase - excellent service when you consider they travelled more than 12,000 miles to Australia."
2,Peter Rabbit,The book is great but one I thought I'd cancelled because it just did not suit the child I had planned to give it to. I haven't returned it yet and must get to it along w/ thr address book.
3,Item not as described,"Whilst the books are fantastic, the item didn't come as described. The advert stated that the books came in a presentation box, which they didn't. Whilst the seller refused to take responsibility for their faulty advertising (and continued to do this, even when asked to amend their advert to an accurate description), am grateful to Amazon for taking responsibility and providing a full refund for the purchase."
3,not what I thought,"it's a nice collection, just smaller than I thought. The books are only 4 x 5. Too small for a child to read and hard for an adult to read and show."
5,Tales That Span Generations...,"This Peter Rabbit collection is a tiny world of parables, stories and lessons for children and adults of all ages. The beauty of the books is greatly enhanced by their encapsulation in a darling box, and they are just the right size for small hands to look through and admire. The simple pictures tell the story even without words! They are a wonderful addition for the bookshelf of your child, and the lessons they teach are most appropriate today- in a world where trouble exists and ethics are compromised."
3,Below average carbide,I love using carbide vs. HSS! This cutter works great till i noticed that after 3 ops. the coating was wearing and was already chipping in places. I used a Iscar cutter on titanium for more than 3 ops. and the coating hasn't faded much and hasn't chipped; still very sharp. I would think paying $70 for a cutter it would last longer!!!!!

2,"""dead"" watch",I purchased this as a gift for a close friend. He opened it up - loved it but we could not get it to work. We had to replace the battery in this brand new watch!
5,Some more alums of Hughes High,"Before the Isley family moved to New Jersey, they lived in Cincinnati, Ohio and some of the Isley children attended the historical Hughes High School. This CD is fantastically remastered and has some great, classic Isley hits. GO BIG RED!"
3,"only a like, not in love.","I heard a friend's CD by these guys and decided to buy this. I wasn't happy, but I was expecting more of the same stuff I heard on my friend's CD. This was obviously a mix of their offerings over the years. I was looking for some love songs."
1,athe essential isley borthers,i could not hear the music on your website even though i downloaded the windows software for apple os x. i will look for a site that accepts apple osx without dealing with microsoft.
5,Wonderful Compilation,"This Isley Brothers compilation is all it should be and more. It's got all of the hits and then some. The sound is great and it's such a joy to listen to. If you get one Isley Brothers compilation, it should be this one. Highly recommended set, from one of the greatest soul/funk groups."
4,"ALMOST GREAT, BUT NOT LIVIN THE LIFE","What can you say about the Isley Brothers? Almost everything they did in the 70s is classic R&B; and Funk and this collection does a fairly good job, but how can you call this an essential collection without two of their greatest and most essential songs.Livin' the Life is one of the top five essential songs the Isleys ever recorded. The other major ommission is Climbin' Up the Ladder. These two songs are the Isleys at their most jammin' although Ernie does tear it up on That Lady.Good introduction to the group, but Go For Your Guns should be next. Although short, it jams."
4,I liked the book!,"I really like this book. Especially touching were the last few chapters.Bobby Darin is a favorite of mine. He was so talented. His early death was such a loss to the music world.Perhaps the author portrayed Bobby Darin too hard and cruel in his quest for stardom. It seemed at times like the author was feeling sorry for himself too much. He certainly portrayed himself as Bobby's ""flunky"".But, all in all, I really liked the book"
1,You like whining? You like jealousy? This book is for you!,"As much as Karmen tried to make Darin look mean and hateful, what he succeeded in doing was show that Darin knew exactly what he wanted and how to get it - add his extraordinary talent to the mix, and you have a star. Karmen had no guts, a thin skin, and couldn't believe that Darin wouldn't let him ride his coat tails to success.This book, though, is mostly about the adventures leading up to Karmen's loss of virginity. At the end, he begrudgingly reunites with Darin prior to his death, and ""feels better"".The book contains dialog you are supposed to believe is verbatim, and tries very hard to make Darin look like a mean spirited jerk that cast aside his friends on the way to stardom.It didn't work. Instead, Darin looks smart, and Karmen is just another jealous guy whose claim to fame is that 'he was there'.Karmen should have stuck to his very good jingles and left the past alone."
1,BOBBY D MINUS,"If your idea of insightful biography is page after page of mundane conversations--presented supposedly verbatim, decades after the fact!--this one's for you. Anyone expecting anything more should consider themselves warned."
4,My Most Pleasant Surprise of the Year,"Food isn't my #1 interest but this book's title caught my eye, I picked it up and couldn't put it down. Fascinating (and tempting) facts, extremely well-written with wit and panache, this book kept me interested throughout and furnished me with useful information along with the motivation to explore the places Ms. Cone tells about and sample their products. The ONLY reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is the simple fact that it's not a suspense-thriller. I only give 5 stars to those books....and rarely to them."
1,DVD-R 4.7GB 2X,"Too bad I can't give it 0 stars - it wasn't even the right product. I was specifically looking for 2X DVDs since this is all my DVD recorder will work with and this item seemed to fit the bill, but when it arrived, the package contained 16x DVDs. Darn it, why can't you change the title on this one if you arn't going to sell 2x DVDs. I'm more than mad to have spent close to $50 on a product I cannot use.Update: Turns out the vendor says Amazon is responsible for putting the wrong title on this product. They do not sell 2x DVDs and never will. They did send UPS to pick-up the package and say they will issue a credit as soon as they receive the return."
1,Item Not as Advertised,The product received was not 2x DVDs as advertised but was 16X instead which will not work in my DVD recorder. The seller informed me that they did not have 2x and was very cooperative in returning the merchandise and issuing a credit.TDK Systems DVD-R 4.7GB 2X WRITE GEN-USE SPINDLE 100PK ( DVD-R47ABXCB100 )
3,Less Than Stellar....,"...not the videos, but how this was packaged. Its been said before, but if you are going to label a DVD/VHS Madonna: Video Collection 93-99, one would think all the videos from that era would be included. But they aren't. I can see why ""This Used To Be My Playground"" and ""I'll Remember"" may not have been included, there are copyright issues because those music videos feature clips from movies, but there is no excuse why videos like ""Deeper and Deeper"", ""I want You"", ""You'll See"", ""You Must Love Me"" etc etc were not included. However for the videos that are included, it is truly a treat for the fans, to own the videos for masterpieces like ""Bedtime Story"", ""Bad Girl"", ""Rain"", and all of her other major videos. It just would have been nice to have a more complete video collection for the fans, but who knows, maybe someday we will get one."
4,Hey pretty good,"The only videos I've saw on this thing: ""Ray of Light,"" ""Power of Goodbye,"" ""Nothing Really Matters."" But they were all pretty good except for ""Nothing Really Matters"" which was weird. It had what looked like fake Japenese people in it. Madonna had a kimono on I think! Other than that big mistake (the song's way different than this video) the videos I've seen were okay. I mean they were pretty good."
3,Not a complete video log! Where's the rest of them?,"I am very disappointed that Madonna's great videos ""You'll See"", ""...Used To Be My Playground"", ""I'll Remember"" were NOT included on this video collection! There should be a second release issued for the missing videos including ""Erotica"". What a let down... At least I'm happy to see a new video compilation being released!"
3,How could they leave out...?,"I am very happy to see finally a new video collection for Madonna! However, how could they leave out so many good Madonna music videos? All these music videos have never been released on home video and were still not included here: ""Crazy For You"", ""Who's That Girl"", ""Dear Jessie"", ""This Use To Be My Playground"", ""Justify My Love"", ""Erotica"", ""Deeper and Deeper"", ""I'll Remember"", ""You'll See"", and ""I Want You"". Now I can possibly see why ""Erotica"" and ""Justify My Love"" which would slap on a parental advisory onto the DVD, but I cannot believe they left out all those other classic Madonna videos. Shame on you Warner Brothers."
3,David Fincher is Excellent!,"The coolest thing about this dvd are the videos david fincher did. Reason for the being is, well, he's just a really good director."
4,"GREAT, BUT MISSING A FEW","I absolutely LOVE Madonna...always have, always will. I think she is a true artist and is very creative. She has some of the BEST videos ever made. The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars is what she chose not to include : Erotica, You'll See, Justify My Love, Deeper and Deeper, I Want You plus any others I've forgotten. I understand not putting the Evita songs on there, except for You Must Love Me, which she wrote especially for the film. Perhaps in the next five to ten years she'll come out with a complete collection. But I am THRILLED this did come out....all of her videos are amazing. A true ICON that has been misunderstood and deserves LOTS of credit! Viva MADONNA! Also, check out ""Immaculate Collection"" if you don't own it already!"
4,Video collectio 93 99,"el DVD aunque en la información del empaque dice que cuenta con close caption no lo tiene, excepto el VHS. Es por ello que lo califiqué con 4 estrellas. Esto creo es un error de información. Además que faltan más videos como ""YOU'LL SEE"" y ""I'LL REMEMBER. ¿Cuánto tiempo tendremos que esperar los fans de Madonna para tener estos videos?"
4,Madonnamorphosis through the 90's !,"This video collection is a must for any true Madonna fan as it chronicles her more significant videos from the Erotica, Bedtime Stories and Ray of Light albums. I missed a few videos though like:""You'll See"", ""I'll Remember"", and the Evita tracks like ""You Must Love Me"" and ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"". My favorite video would still be ""Rain"" with its elegantly artistic Japanese direction. One could witness firsthand all the image transformations that Madonna has gone through the 90's with this collection. More power to the Artist of the New Millennium!"
4,WHAT HAPPENED?,"First of all, in my book Madonna can do no wrong. However, I have to question why she agreed to omit some of her videos from this collection. Besides the glaring omissions of Justify My Love and Erotica, where is the video to You'll See? How can you include the first part (Take a Bow) and not bother to put in the second half? All the other videos however are superb, from the tongue-in-cheek Human Nature to the flawless Frozen."
3,1992 was a lot better year for Madonna vids than 1993,"The first Madonna video DVD (The Immaculate Collection) stops in 1990. Yet for some reason this collection starts off in 1993, meaning that it leaves out the three big hits from 1992's Erotica album (Deeper And Deeper, This Used To Be My Playground and Erotica). The 3 songs from Erotica represented here had videos produced in '93, but they weren't near the successes that the 3 omitted tunes were.The ""TIC"" DVD is just as much of a head-scratcher: no Holiday, Into The Groove, Crazy For You or Justify My Love.For more than a decade, the premiere of every Madonna video was an Event-with-a-capital-E, a phenomenon which only Michael Jackson could match, and which her contemporaries like Prince, The Cars, Duran Duran, Tom Petty and Peter Gabriel could only dream about. Hopefully Warner can go back to the vaults and emerge with a two-disc collection that's not only immaculate but comprehensive."
