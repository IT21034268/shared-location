2,VERY VERY THIN GLASS - NOT WORTH FULL PRICE,"I got it on sale for a couple bucks, which is fine. But it is very thin cheap quality that barely provides any ""shading"" of any wattage bulb - kinda useless."
3,Eh....nothing to write home about,"The slide keyboard kept sliding open in my pocket which was awkward, and this phone is uncomfortably thick. And it claims to have a wide range of Java games available, but when I went to d/l some new games, there were only about 6 available. 6 is not wide range."
4,What Are You Looking For?,"I bought this phone for a reason other than its advertised intended purpose--for writing memos. I had wanted to purchase a Treo for the very same reason--but found it to be overkill for my needs (in both features and price).I use this phone to write grocery lists, jot down quick ideas, and send (very) quick SMS messages. I find the slide-out keyboard to be extremely useful and, although the phone could be a bit slimmer, it certainly has a smaller footprint than a Treo or Blackberry--and I have found it to be sufficiently compact.I can honestly say that this is the best phone that I personally have ever owned."
5,Calling All Med Students!,"This is the book for you! Clear, concise, up-to-date and full-colour detail made this book the most useful book on my shelf."
4,Enough information,I found it more usful to be use as reference book rather than for everyday reading in my your medicine rotation. Easy to understand and contains many pictures. Same as its brother (Kumar Clinical Medicine)
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book compared to the Lady of the Forest. I found the plot to be interesting, but the ending was very boring and I felt was the author's easy way out. I would not recommend and would not read again (unlike Forest, which is a great re-read)."
2,If you have nothing else to read,"The Prologue was very fun to read. The rest of the novel was in varying degrees, sometimes good, sometimes slow, sometimes bad bad bad. Also, this is a sequel to an earlier novel and to my mind it failed in introducing the characters to someone who hadn't read the first one. I don't know if she did a better job in that novel but, although I recognized them from the legends, I didn't really get a clear picture of any of them, except for the minstrel Alan who had a very well defined character. Will seemed like a caricature.If you don't have anything to read and this is there or if you are in love with the Robin Hood myth, then sure, go for it. But I wouldn't go out of my way."
4,An excellent sequel,"This book is a sequel to Ms. Roberson's hit novel ""Lady of the Forest."" I adore that book. I was very excited when I discovered that there was a sequel. I read it in three days and was fairly satisified. I would not recommend you read it if you have not read ""Lady of the Forest."" The characters are not very well detailed in ""Lady of Sherwood"" and there is a lot of action that doesn't resolve itself until late in the book. But all in all, it was very enjoyable and I enjoyed reading it!"
3,A So-so follow up to Lady of the Forest,"First off, WTH is the publisher thinking re-releasing this book with a cover like this? Any sex that happens in this book is left wholly to the reader's imagination - this is not a mindless bodice ripping romance. This book opens five years after the close ofLady Of The Forestand Robin is still estranged from his father and living with Marian at Ravenswood (that's a bit of a stretch, openly living in sin in the 13C). Richard The Lion Heart is wounded and dying and the evil Prince John prepares to take the throne, the always over the top evil Sheriff of Nottingham is thrilled as now Richard once Richard is dead he can prosecute Robin and his not-so-merry band of men.I have to admit this book just didn't sing for me, nor was the story enough to keep me enthralled. If you loved LOTF and are dying to read the rest of the story, you might enjoy this, but not as a stand alone book. Not great, but not bad either. Three stars"
3,I was really not too impressed,"About the only thing that saved this book was the fact it was about Robin Hood. This book is a sequal to a previous novel, which was very good. In this one, Robin Hood and Maid Marian are living together on Marian's estates, which I didn't buy into at all. In that era, I don't think they would be living together out of wedlock as they are in the book.What I enjoyed the most about this book was the unease and otherwise unrest surrounding the succession of John as King of England."
2,This story made no sense to me,"This story made very little sense to me. First the title, Lady of the Forest; the Lady in this story actually spends very little time in the forest. It is also full of themes that conflict with each other and the setting/period in which it was written. Robin is little more than an actual villain at this point, he kills pretty much indiscriminately. The Sheriff is evil and though I can believe in the scope of his power, I cannot believe in the ways Marian chose to defy him. The book is full of catastrophic setbacks for the main characters but somehow, everything turns out all right in the end. It is as though the author wanted to create as much drama and suspense as possible and still have a happy ending, in order to do that effectively this would have needed to be a much longer book. I finished it, but I was very frustrated."
2,Very Weak,I have been using most of the CreataCards versions for some time. This reminded me of those teaser programs that they throw in with a new printer. It gives you a very limited feel for the program. If you expect to make your own cards don't expect much of a card selection. Most categories just give you a selection of 3 card choices. Spend a few more bucks and stay away from this Special Edition. This was a waste of money!
2,This was a total let down,Extremely disappointed in this disc-creatacard. I thought it would have much more variety for cards but it does not. You have to buy them and then the choices are not good to choose from. I do not even use this at all. Total let down.
1,American Greetings Special Edition,"This is without a doubt the worst piece of software I have ever purchased.By the title I expected it to be an upgrade of CreateaCard gold 8. I simply uninstalled it, and threw the disk in the garbage."
2,disappointed; too limited; not worth$$,Would not recommend purchasing special edition: suggest pay more and get better choices. Its limited choices didnot make it worth purchasing.
3,"good book, but better to get from library if possible","I thought this was a quality, well written book. It gives practical suggestions on how to overcome some issues, as well as examples of traumas that people have overcome. Given that I have studied psychology and neuroscience, I found much to be ""common sense"" to me, though it did cue me in to a FEW things I was unaware of. It is very concise, so was able to finish reading it in one day. Given those factors I didn't feel it was worth purchasing, it may be better suited to the layperson. I also thought the consistently referred to scenario of a man being attacked by a dog was somewhat absurd. However, I suspect the author likely did this so as to not minimize, and therefore validate the difficult experiences many people have had in life. From one individual to another our propensity to be ""traumatized"" varies greatly. Buy used or get from library if possible."
3,It's just another trauma book from a kinesthetic angle,"My friend loved the book and it really help him go through whatever process he was going through. The writing is average, nothing to write home about. I could see how it would help some people and not others. Read the first few pages. If it doesn't trip your trigger, seek help elsewhere."
4,A good support tool,"Counselors need good support tools to help their clients. This book, The Body Remembers, is a great tool to help explain the issues that a person's body might go through as a part of a traumatic experience. The aches and pains of trauma are real so with books like this on the market; it helps both clinicians and patients affirm the psychological and the physical aspects of trauma. I recommend this book to any professional or layman looking to learn more about how Trauma affects the body."
5,Listen Carefully - Genius At Work,"Steven Wilson (Porcupine Tree) is one of Britain's most prolific and talented musicians. This wonderful album gives you a flavour of his genius. Recorded in 1988-89 when a complete unknown, with no record deal, no audience, but lots of ideas - this record is simply amazing. Remastered and re-issued (it was originally released on cassette by an Italian label in 1999) this is a really entertaining musical experience. The sound quality is excellent and the album features songs by Nick Drake and Donovan. It's a fantastic experience on headphones too!"
3,"Good, but not in the same calibar as Flowermouth or Together We're Stranger.","I am simply not crazy about Speak. It feels lifeless and emotionless to me. It has a great cover of Nick Drake's ""Pink Moon"", which is worth three stars itself. But if you are expecting an album as great as Flowermouth, you might disappointed."
1,b-sides?,Please post track listings. There are 8 different versions of this single and i would like to know which one this is before i buy it.
5,A great song for those who just can't forget a loved one,"I really wasn't a Smashing Pumpkins fan until a month ago. After listning to this single, I know why they are so great. Hearing this single makes me think about my past mistakes and look at them in perspective I never seen befor..."
2,"Overpriced, not great tasting","The coffee really wasn't that great. It comes in small packages and is very expensive, given that there are alternative Italian coffees that are much better and cheaper."
4,good coffee,"I bought this coffee for my wife, she love this coffee very much, I aslo tried mix them with starbuck coffee, the combination is good too."
1,Not impressed.,"Old, dry beans. I was not impressed. After hearing people rave about these beans, I was looking forward to my first cup of espresso using them. What a let down."
5,Beautiful handbook for life,I actually ordered this book by accident. But I felt a nudge to pick it up and once I did I couldn't put it down. Finished the entire book in one night. It is heartbreaking but full of love and hope. I will be giving it to everyone I know.
5,A heartfelt story of the road to recovery after a loss...,"Melody Beattie has done a wonderful job telling the storyof her son's tragic death. She takes us through the realemotions and brings us into her reading. The reader is sureto be touched by her story. I cried and felt comforted asI heard one person's ways of dealing with one of the worstlosses of her life. It is a book written not from theoutside, but from the heart."
1,Mine is the only dissenting opinion,"I thought it was one of the worst books I have ever read. I bought it based on the reviews here and couldn't wait to read it. I started it and came back to this website to make sure I hadn't ordered the wrong title. After seeing the five star rating, I went back and tried again to read it and found it just as boring. Must be me."
5,"I work in Sales, but don't usually buy what I sell! LOL","Greetings Author Mavrikis. I work in a retail bookstore and have been in this field for some 10 years. I am writing to let you know that while your book The Ice Pick Technique wasn't the biggest seller we've ever had, it did gain the interest of some of the employees, who went on to buy, as I myself did, and read it. I must say that if books could sell themselves; yours would be right on top! It was wonderful, and I am not the only one who feels this way. No-one at the store disagree's that you should continue writing and will one day be famous. I want you to know I have never written a review before. Best of luck, Kathy Einhorn"
5,Interesting,Good book. It was interesting and got me wondering about stuff like this. Nice book from a big reader. Do you like Stephen King? He is my favorite author. Any more books?
1,How do I reach you?,"Hi Anna, this is Seth Cantor, I thoroughly enjoyed your book and cherish the copy you signed for me. I have been trying to find out where you might be holding another book signing or if you have any new releases. I left you my phone number, address, email and work information. Please take a minute to get in touch so I can keep on top of what your coming out with next. You are a delightful woman and a fabulous author. God Bless You. Love Seth"
3,A Big Drop In Quality From The Debut,"The debut album by The Mysteries Of Life was stunning, but this indie-label follow-up EP is a disappointment. Of the 6 songs, only ""I Need To Know Where I Stand"" stands out. The other 5 songs are nondescript. They did rebound on their second full-length album, and I remain a big fan, but this EP is unessential."
3,Kari just having fun,I was hoping this was going to be funny but it's not.It doesn't even have moments of being funny.The fact that the Video encoding was terrible didn't help.
3,Good buy for the price,"Performed as advertised. Price was reasonable, quality was in line with what I paid. Works well. Larger than I expected. I have a subcompact and it takes up a lot of room on the dashboard."
4,Better than expected for the price!,"I am really enjoying the quality of this product. There are a few hisses and crackles when the station competes with the signal, but other than that the quality is very clear. I'm no audiophile, but it suits my needs."
4,"""I ain't gonna quit shootin' Gators!""","Lon Chaney Jr.'s role stood out in this movie as the drunken swamp rat Manon, who lost his left hand to an alligator. His hatred for the critters is evident as he runs over one with his truck and stands by the swamp one night with his pistol, blasting away, but not hitting a damn thing! At this stage in his life, Chaney probably had playing a drunk down pat since he was reportedly drunk while filming a lot of his movies.The Alligator People is a typical campy 1950s horror flick, but it's good fun to watch on a Saturday night with a bucket of popcorn.The scenes in the Louisiana swamp and at the plantation add a spooky ambiance to the movie, which really helped it along."
4,"""MY HUSBAND WAS AN ALLIGATOR!""","Yes,Horror Fans...It's time to enter the swamp lands of the South, marry your Bride and settle down. There's just One Problem: YOU are an Alligator Man! This delightful frightful Film stars Beverly Garland as a Wife who discovers Hubby is more than human...He's part Alligator! Then there's a hook-handed stalker in the woods who won't leave her alone! (Played by Universal WolfMan Lon Chaney Jr). For a B-Movie, it's actually VERY well-made, and you will feel sympathy for the poor man who learned too late: MEN and ALLIGATORS don't MIX!"
4,DVD Version,"I will not delve to much into the movie itself as it has been pretty well covered here. While i do not see a comparison to The Fly as one contributor did, i do think this may have been a precursor to Swamp Thing, as regeneration of body tissue and limbs is the idea of the mad scientist. Gator genes used on humans? You know its gonna go bad. And Lon Chaney Jr., although in a lesser role is a real treat. The DVD qulaity is spectacular and the Widescreen presentation is truly widescreen aspect, no anamorphic deception on this one as on so many of these old classics. If you like the old sci-fi/horror of the 50's this is a pretty decent movie and as said, a very nice print."
4,"this may well be the reason they coined the phrase ""awful fun""","don't ya love enthusiastically semi-shabby and politically incorrect old B movies ? you get to see all kinds of cool stuff like water jeeps and whisky fueled performances by elders from the golden age of horror . the appliance our poor titular character (BRUCE BENNETT) has to wear toward the end of this very engaging knee slapper is genuinely one of a kind . cool house . pretty darn good performance by BEVERLY GARLAND . fantastically fun performance by LON CHANEY JR. . always good to see old reliable faces like GEORGE MACREADY being all earnest and driven' that water jeep and whatnot . the swamp is super fun to see and is bona fide atmospheric . here , take my hand and step back in time to 1959 . see how they did it . you won't be sorry . promise ."
3,Gonna Hook Me A Gator!,"Lon Chaney jr. hates alligators. One of the horrible reptiles ate one of his hands (now replaced by a nifty hook), and Lon's held a grudge ever since! Enter Jane (Beverly Garland), searching for her runaway groom. She ends up in the swamplands of gator-country, where a mad scientist is injecting war vets with alligator serum. Uh-oh! His patients are getting mighty scaly! Jane must face the awful truth about her husband and his involvement in these hideous experiments! She must also face Lon jr! Watch out for that hook! ALLIGATOR PEOPLE is every bit as good as it's title implies. Worth a quick peek on a sleepless night..."
1,Not what I ordered,"What I got was an Excel Tutorial in Spanish, which I know none of... the item displayed did not, in any way, say anything about it being a tutorial, or the fact that it was in Spanish... On the positive side, I was able to return it and get a full refund, with no problem........."
2,Fox Terriers,"The pictures are wonderful. The first 32 pages of the book are specific to fox terriers (history, grooming, breed standard). The remainder of the 192 pages is a generic dog book. If you want information on fox terriers this book has very little."
5,Great for everyone!,"I enjoyed this even though I would not call myself a ""Twi-hard"". It documents the rise of a phenomenon that is fascinating on so many levels, fan or not. The natural scenery is beautiful and a part that really stuck with me was a woman from the Forks Chamber of Commerce saying ""They [the fans] come here for Twilight, but they return for Forks""."
1,horrible!,pretty boring after the first couple mins. save your money and just hit yourself in the face with a frying pan.
3,Twilight In Forks: The Saga of the Real Town,"Nice to watch, but would have liked to have seen more views of the town and surrounding areas. I visited Forks and just would have liked more pictures of the place."
3,This is the one advertised on the Twilight DVDs,"At 84 minutes, this isn't a great Forks video but I think it's better than ""Destination Forks"". You'll get some town history, some dialog from various citizens ( I remember several including business people, teachers, a couple of HS graduates- he was a waste of breath ""yeah, whatever"" sort of stuff, she really seemed to care. There was even a man, a shingle maker, who wasn't a fan himself but OK with Twilight if it helps the town.) you even get some talk from a few visiting fans. Not enough to plan a trip with, and most people won't want to watch it often but worthwhile for a fan collection."
3,"Great low price, not so interesting.",I paid next to nothing for this movie so it wasn't wasted. I found the movie sort of dull. As a twilight fan it droned on and on. I gave it to a friend who enjoyed it. Enough said.
2,very angry,"I am very angry, sent me a DVD in French, and I needed to subitulos in Spanish like this in the description, I think it is disrespectful"
3,twiliight in forks,I think the concept was interesting but the some of choices of individuals/citizens/visitors that the phtographers repeatedly highlighted did not do the concept any favors.
4,Documentary Review,"Informative, a bit biased, of course. I enjoy the Twilight Saga (more than i sould) so this is paricularly perfecy for me, i highly reccomend this DVD for ANY Twilight fan. Now I HAVE to visit Forks!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not What I Expected,"After seeing some of the beautiful scenery in the movies, I was excited about watching this documentary. I had hoped there would be more footage of the town of Forks, but instead this was mostly a bunch of fans talking about how much they love the books and the movies. I consider myself to be a big fan of Twilight (more so of the books than the movies), but I actually fell asleep watching this."
4,Makes a good addition to a Twilight fan's collection,I purchased this DVD because I'm a HUGE Twilight fan and the previews for it at the begining of the movie DVDs had me curious. It's pretty good. It's definatly interesting to see the way Twilight has impacted the people in this town. Good buy for any major fan of the saga.
5,Surprising,"You know, I didn't think I would purchase this DVD, don't want to be completely obsessed, and I already have the books, DVDs, Director's Notebook, and the Illustrated book - but I watched Twilight in Forks on cable and enjoyed it. I enjoyed hearing about the town, seeing Jacob's grandfather, and the townsfolks where simply great. I don't know, maybe just one more thing to add to my Twilight life, but I want to say thanks to Forks for indulging the fans and sharing their town."
1,Horrendous,"Since 2007 I have claimed that Fantastic Four Part 2 is the worst movie ever made. But after seeing this (which is arguably not a movie) I have changed my mind. It is basically a series of interviews with people who have nothing to say. They are just basking in their five minutes of fame and making fools of themselves.I suppose ... that if you are indeed such an adamant twilight fan that four books and 3-5 movies are not enough to satiate you, then you need to take the next step and watch this trash, but really I think you need an intervention."
4,twilight in froks,It was very interting to see how forks was uses in the movie .. We have been to Forks Washington. In March 2007.
2,Not too impressed,"I have mixed feelings about this video. It showed the real town of Forks, which was nice, but rambled on with too many interviews. I was hoping for more talk about the actual filming of the movie but did not get it. Overall, just OK."
3,good information baout twlight,The information about the twlight sauga was great. however I was looking more tward actual history of Forks and La push.
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. When I finally watched it, the time to return it had elapsed or I would have returned it. A total waste of money."
5,Just what I was looking for,Great price on the product. Have been looking for this type of stock pot and this is a great price.
1,What's that smell?,"The pot arrived and I quickly noticed that it had a very pungent, chemical smell almost like the smell of moth balls but even more intense. I opened it up outside and let it air out. That was when I noticed the dent on the bottom edge.I haven't been able to wash off the smell and have tried ""seasoning"" the pan by boiling water in it a couple of times with the exhaust vent on high in the hope that whatever the issue was would burn off but I still smell the chemical smell on the pot. Needless to say, I won't be cooking in this pot with this issue."
5,Great Pot,"Last Christmas we had to make chili and haul it 250 miles to my mother's for Christmas Eve. We needed a big pot and one that would travel well. We looked at a lot of stock pots before deciding on this one. We couldn't be happier. I like the vent in the lid. The lid fits well, too. The weight of the pan is better than most and the chili did not stick to the bottom. It cleans easily. There's just nothing not to like!"
5,Great Cooking Pot,"Try finding one of these T-Fal's of this size...they are generally not available in our area - we have looked. We've found other brands of Pots this size and generally of similar quality, however, pricing was also higher. Do not be afraid to purchase this large Pot from Amazon. Great Value."
1,lousy knock-off!!!!,I have had this product for about a year now and i only used it for 2 or 3 times. I noticed that the top will not fit the pot! The handle on the side of the pot is loose and the pot appears to be a knock-off!! I am sick and tired of being ripped off by these people!!
2,Horrible chemical odor inside the pot,"Like another reviewer, my pot arrived reeking of mothballs (why?). Nothing I've tried has taken the odor out...scrubbing with detergent, soaking in bleach, soaking in water with baking soda, leaving it out in the sun, boiling water in it. The smell is still there, and I am afraid to cook in it (obviously). It's going back for exchange.Other than the nasty chemical smell, however, it's a nice large pot, reasonably thick walled, with sturdy handles. In trying to clean it, I was hauling 12 quarts of water all over the kitchen and yard, and the handles handled the load just fine."
1,It's going back,"Needed a large pot for those times when I was cooking for quite a few. Read all the reviews and decided to take a chance on it. But, like a couple of other reviewers, my pot arrived with a bad chemical-like odor inside. Tried washing, soaking in water and detergent, soaking in vinegar. The smell remains. No way will I cook anything in this pot so it's being returned."
4,Extremely pleasant and promising start.,"Windmaster's Bane has all the elements that you'd expect from the first volume of a fantasy series. Magic, wish fulfillment for the reader (a normal guy turns out to be a hero), mythology and fairies. David Sullivan is a likable ordinary hero, and Deitz does a brilliant job of weaving together local Georgia color and Irish mythology.I unfortunately found that the series went downhill from here- somehow it got sidetracked into something for the real D&D; crowd, but I really enjoyed this first book both on reading and re-reading."
1,SADDLEMAN 2846714 X BOUND SEAT COVER,"I to ordered 2 of these seat covers for my Mack dump truck. I got one canvas that is perfectly what I was looking for. It matched the ones I have already had in my other vehicle. They are so durable. The best I have ever found for a work truck. The other seat cover that was in the same order, same type box, same part # is the cheapest material that I have ever seen. Some kind of stretchy polyester that fell apart before I got it on. My finger nail snagged and frayed the black area during installation. They don't even match in color. The cheap one has a greenish tint in the area that should be gray. The cheap one also has thin foam on the back side of the black stretchy material. From some of the other revenues I have seen. Sounds like Amazon will have nothing to do with satisfying the customer in any manner on this issue. Vary disapointed. If you order on Amazon. Be prepared to bend over and take it in the rear!!!"
1,Save your money,"These seat cover looked nice until the front started coming apart after two weeks. After a month the front was completely open. Cheap construction and materials, Save your money on this item and look elsewhere."
2,disappointed,"Had bought these seat covers about 6 years ago, and loved them. They were tough and made out of a durable nylon type material. The new ones that I just bought look like the old ones, but are made out of a cheaper material. I guess they will do for now, but I won't buy these again. I don't believe these will last HALF as long as the old ones I had. I would reccommend that anyone needing a set of covers go ahead and pay a little more for a good quality pair. I don't think you'll be sorry."
2,Shipped Wrong Item,"I ordered these seat covers for my '97 TJ & thought they'd be great - and they would have been had I received the same kind. one was all canvas (perfect, exactly what I ordered & matched the description) the other one was in the same kind of box, with the same UPC code, but was made out of the cheap stretchy polyester that the cheap covers are known for. I asked Amazon to double check the cover when it shipped, thinking I could order another one & send back one, and they refused, so I sent back both covers. Worth the money if you get what you ordered, but good luck with that."
1,DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM SADDLEMAN!!!!!!,Bought Saddleman seat covers from Autoanything. First set did NOT fit and began to tear at the seams within a week. Returned for another set. This canvas one was missing the loops necessary to attach to seat and stitching was sub par. This weak area ripped apart also in first week. They would not replace or refund. Only would allow me to send these horrible covers back for repair.I read many reviews concerning Saddleman and how their seats were very difficult to install and did not fit or look exceptionally well. I convinced myself that these people just didn't have ability or patience to install them correctly. BOY WAS I WRONG. SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THEM!!! DON'T BUY THEM!!!
3,"Good sound, bad fit.","The sound quality of these ear-buds are very nice. However, they hurt my ears because they don't fit right. I've tried other ear-bud styles that fit fine, but for some reason these have a ridge in them that makes them very uncomfortable (even with the soft foam cushions on them)."
2,Decent sound but uncomfortable,The sound quality you receive is good for the price. However they are uncomfortable in your ear and tend to fall out easily.
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"I had many interests that led to my reading of this book. I was hoping for the best but prepared for mediocrity. Sadly, I wasn't prepared for what a let down this book turned out to be. The authors style is bland and contrived. The subject this book sets out to cover is an important one that deserves recognition, however, Lila Marz Harper doesn't do it justice. Harper gave it a nice try, but I would look forward to seeing another author attempt to take the lead in writing a story on this topic."
3,Rubber mat on passenger's side discolored brown/yellow,"These are very cute mats, however, I was disappointed the yellow rubber on passenger side was discolored a ""yellow-brown""...at first I thought it was dirt but it appears it is part of the rubber coloring."
5,Love this pedal,Great tone. Can use it for times when you don't want to bother with the regular wah pedals with the expression pedal to it. Love it though for that wah sound!
5,Great Video Series,"The Capstick hunting videos are absolutely top shelf.I recommend the complete set.Cheers!Dr. Stephen W. Templar, Author: rexGunRexgun"
5,A Winning Read!,THE HIDDEN HEART is a wonderful sequel to SO WILD A HEART! I recommend you start with the first book then THE HIDDEN HEART and follow up with SECRETS OF THE HEART. All three books are easy to read regency romances with a flare of mystery. The stories are closely connected that it's best to start with the first in the series.
4,Another great series!,"All three of these books are wonderful! It is so sweet, this story! I would definitly want to read it again! I usually go for the spicy rather than the sweet romance novels but I find myself willing to pick up a Candace Camp book anyday and enjoy it. She is too good to pass up!"
4,Sinatra and me,the book Sinatra and me is a boring constantly referring to Frank and me the book does not really reveal any real detailed experiences
4,A Genteel Mafioso Mayor -- No Subtitles on Amazon,"Steve Buscemi is wonderful as the corrupt mayor of Atlantic City -- fearless in his actions to protect what is ""his."" The entire cast is terrific and I look forward to Season II.The problem with Amazon videos continues as there are no optional subtitles and several various dictions or accents of the English language for which subtitles would be more than useful."
5,Very exciting and involving TV series worth the purchase.,"The reating is because I enjoy the series muchly, and feel others might too enjoy it if they purchase the series without Comercials!"
2,Boardwalk Empire: Season 1,Chose this movie because Steve Buscemi is in it. His acting really fell flat. Not as good as I expected.
4,I like Gangster things and wanted to give it a shot.,"It was interesting. I don't have time to devote to watching it right now though. So, if you are a busy person, probably not for you."
5,About Time...,It's about time that they make a awesome series! ! My husband and I LOVE all the characters. This is a wonderful season!!!!
3,These only play properly on a PS3,"The picture, albeit very dark, is fine. Likewise the sound is fine. The problem, as noted by others, is that the discs simply won't play properly with most Blu-ray players. Since the firmware on my Sony Blu-ray player is right up to date, it would appear that it is a hardware issue. The processors in most Blu-ray players are simply insufficient to play this set properly. The processor in the PS3 is more powerful and thus can play these discs properly. But unless you will play these on a PS3, this is a good set to avoid. As noted by other reviews, there are numerous issues with these discs. Get a one month subscription to HBO from your provider and then stream these to your computer. You will save money and aggravation."
3,ok but not on par with sopranos or the wire or rome for that matter...,"the story, acting, directing, production etc were all first rate, id expect nothing less from the team responsible for BE. The area where this fell down was in the script. Although weve had other shows that moved at a slow pace, this just seemed to drag and drag. The only thing i can come up with is there is no humour in this show; its just dour...Sopranos, Rome and even The Wire had great humour that just seemed to complement the drama.Im aware that some of the writers for BE also worked on the sopranos, but i feel theyve missed a beat here. in this regard, BE has more similarities to Brotherhood than other great HBO shows. Watchable but not up to previous standards..."
5,Extremely Satisfied!,"I'm a big fan of the show, so much that I wanted the first season on disk. Go to show reviews on google or whatever if you want the show reviews.I'll touch on the extra features and picture and sound of this package. There's not too much to say, but it's a good product.All kinds of behind-the-scenes and such on the extra features which I really enjoyed watching. There was commentary on some episodes which was also interesting.Great picture and sound, after all it's Blu-Ray and HBO.Product came shrink-wrapped in great condition."
4,Great show,"Boardwalk Empire is a really great show, takes a look at Atlantic City during prohibition and women's suffrage. This show will hook you fast and even though Season 1 isn't quite as intense, 2 and especially 3 will have you begging for another season!"
4,Good start...,"The main reason for four stars is I think that the first season moved somewhat slow. I'd give Mad Men season one the same rating, because it was also extremely slow. Boardwalk Empire wasn't as bad as Mad Men starting off, though. There is a great writing here, fantastic characters, strong actors, and many combustible elements and relationships. The season finale was particularly good. I'm looking forward to the second season.As a package deal, it should get five stars: the Blu-Ray set, the regular DVD set, and digital copy for both iTunes and Ultraviolet! Plus, the price was low at $37. Can't beat that."
1,Eva,I bought two box sets and both didn't work. I've tried other DVD's that I own and they work fine.
5,Homeland 1st season,"I have the same problem with this set of Homeland DVD's as the last ""playback prohibited by area limitations"".I have reported the problem and there has been no action taken. I am very disappointed."
3,Sloooooooooow...,"Some pretty interesting character development, but it takes a really long time to uncover them. Also, Buscemi miscast as a tough guy. Great as a weasel; not believable is a man-handler. Season two is better."
2,Disappointing,"Production values - great. Character development - not so much. Plot - even less so. The characters are cardboard cutouts moving through their set pieces. Don Bescimi in the title role - it's like Don Knotts playing Don Corleone, for pete's sake! Lots of gratuitous nudity, but it's not enough to save this series - glad I'm only in for the first season."
2,"ITS CERTAINLY NO ""SOPRANOS""","Purchased SEASON ONE mainly because it came from ""THE SOPRANOS"".After the first five chapters,was quite disappointed: it had fancy sets,nice period music and feel of same,but found it quite pretentious and empty,w poor character definitions which made it sometimes confusing and predictable.Am not planning to buy more ""SEASONS""."
1,bland and BORING...,"This show seemed to prove me wrong from the get go. Cast is slow moving and the show is very bland and very boring. I couldn't seem to finish watching the first season...nor did i want to. If it started upbeat and interesting, I would have continued watching. Wouldn't recommend on purchasing this. The cover and advertising were all the best parts!"
3,"expensive looking, but....","Did you enjoy ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Wire""? Well this is about half as good. I received the complete set of Wire and couldn't stop watching it. Boardwalk- I kept flipping over to watch something else. In other words - it was faintly tedious. Buscemi is just ok, but I got irritated in the number of scenes opening with him drinking coffee or whisky or champagne or whatever or lighting a cigarette. Too many shots in darkened rooms, too few strong actors amd a slooooow moving plot add up to a lesser HBO product. Not as dreary as Deadwood, but really a C rating only"
3,Viewed only the first episode,I viewed only the first episode of this series. It was just okay. I'll probably watch it again before deciding if I want to buy the whole first season.
4,"Amazing quality for a TV show. Problem with Amazon, not the show.Read more below.","I was duly impressed with episode 1 of the first season. A first class product. But I have a problem. When you first come to the main page for the show, it plainly states in the regular definition page that Empire is 99 cents PER episode. That certainly sounds like a great deal. Then you find out that after the first one it's minimum $2.99 an episode. But Amazon used the word PER on it's main page for this show.So, it's very misleading. In fact, it's probably illegal to use this language, because it's so misleading.What does this mean? It means I'll probably go to my favorite video store and rent the first season, as it will be much cheaper than Amazon. Heck, other shows are $2.99 in high def. This is regular def at this price.What a great opening for a show. It must have been over an hour....(I wasn't counting the minutes) Stunning production."
5,great,Steve Buscemi is great as a 1920s gangster in New Jersey. An HBO series that shows how the gangster world operated back then.
3,Expectations were too high,"Well acted and beautiful sets and costumes, as a period piece it is well-done. But far too much violence. I didn't get interested enough in the characters to care about what happened to them. I won't be watching beyond the pilot."
2,Was disappointed,"I had been looking forward to watching this series for quite awhile. I watched the first two episodes and honestly now have no interest. It seem to be ""arty"" for no reason and included shock value for no reason. I also simply never cared about the characters. A real disappointment."
5,Wow amazing and engrossing,"In general love the characters. Great detailed characters without getting boring. Nice action and great acting. I wish Buscemi was a bit more intense, but he is still entertaining. I think this show is tough to stop watching. Another top notch HBO production."
5,Enjoyed this episode,"I don't have cable, but I heard so much about this program and found that it was very good. I'm glad that one can sample an episode of a program before deciding whether to buy the whole season."
3,I wanted to love this show,"The acting is top notch (especially Buscemi, as expected); the look is fantastic; it's still a rich era to explore, despite already having been mined to death, but something's just... missing. I simply kept expecting more from the overall arc.I always watch HBO show after they've aired, and I've had this set for about seven months, and still haven't felt compelled to see the second season,which has been available for almost that long."
4,Boardwalk Empire Complete first season,"Just watched the first 2 discs of the series. Loved the actual show, but the extra features are extremely limited, other than the commentaries. But what really drove me crazy was having to watch over five minutes of HBO previews on the first disc without any opt-out allowed. I should not be forced to sit through their advertisements before I am allowed to watch the show I purchased. I was considering adding HBO to my cable subscription, but not after this."
4,Boardwalk,A gratuitus series but well written and very well scored. 4 out of 5. Looking forward to watching season 3
5,Must watch show!,"If you like show during early 20th century and to do with prohibition, this is a show you must watch. Well worth the time"
4,Boradwalk Empire,It is good but can be a little confusing with so many different characters and different locations.Acting is terrific though.
5,Superb!,"A wonderful first season for viewing. Hadn't had the opportunity to watch any of the episodes until my purchase. Great show! Couldn't get enough of it. Sadly, moved too quickly through the season. Now, anxiously awaiting receipt of the complete second season. Terrific acting with a superb plot."
3,What's the deal with nudity?,I was so looking forward to devour all seasons available in a few days!I lost interest after the 3rd or 4th episode of season 1. I don't get why they have to always portray needless nudity. I like beautiful women but it almost makes me mad watching scenes with full frontal nudity with no purpose other than showing tits.They should have kept it to the point...
1,"Remember Deadwood, Rome and the Sopranos before you buy","This is a great show just like Deadwood, Rome and the Sopranos were. My problem is trust. After purchasing two seasons of Deadwood and five of the Sopranos, what did HBO do? They cancelled Deadwood and never gave it a proper ending, they cancelled Rome after two seasons and the Sopranos ending was so bad I traded in the dvd's at a used bookstore and never bouight season six. My concern is after purchasing season 1 and season 2 and so on, will HBO just do what they did with Deadwood, Rome and the Sopranos and leave everyone hanging? I will never waste my money on HBO dvds again."
2,Very poor series,"I haven't and won't buy this series. It is so exciting, I fall asleep every week watching it. I'm not sure whether it's the slow story pace, lousy story lines, or what, but it just can't keep my interest. If you have seen it and enjoyed it, by all means buy it. If you are buying it because you heard it was a great series, or you like mob series, like the Sopranos, you will be very disappointed, I believe."
1,One Star for the Ridiculously Late Release!!!,"It is absolutely disgraceful that HBO cannot get the first season of this very good series released until AFTER the SECOND season is already complete! I can only assume that this is their way of forcing more people to use HBO GO, a service that cable customers still cannot get!!Good Job, HBO, of ensuring that more people will NOT tune in for the second season. NO EXCUSE!!!!!!!"
1,Disappointing!,"Having read all other of JHG books, I must say I was very disappointed in this one. No wonder the publisher refused it and she later published under John Garth. Her readers would have been very disgusted at the theme she chose for the book."
4,Hill Man Written under another name.,"Hill Man was written by Janice Holt Giles under the name of John Garth. A book about rural life, which was not in keeping with the other books JHG had written. I thoroughly enjoyed the book in the 60's, and I can hardly wait to get my copy.Janice and Henry Giles were two outstanding people!"
3,disappointed,"Janice Holt Giles is one of my very favorite authors of historical fiction. I bought HILL MAN expecting another great read. However, I found it far from equal to her other books. I understand it was written under a pseudonym many years ago. My advice? Read Ms. Holt's more well known books: Hannah Fowler, Wellspring, Johnny Osage, The Kentuckians, Savannah, and all the others. You will fall in love with her well written historical fiction that carries you across the nation with westward expansion. As far as Hill Man? Maybe not."
5,To Be Read As Well As Viewed,"Although this is a ""coffee table"" style book, and the pictures are excellent, its stated goal was to review the interaction of humans with Antarctica, and it does this exceedingly well. Ms. Myers insights and her expressions of the feelings of being on this beautiful continent are excellent. Study the photos well, but read the text thoroughly. By all means, get this book if you have any interest in Antarctica."
4,zippity lamp shade,"I am very satisfied w/ this lamp for my baby's room. It works well, and was very reasonably priced. Thanks."
3,Rockin',"This is one I always regreted not buying. It was originally on the Barnaby label (and I just never bought it since I had all the songs by Buddy Holly). These songs are sung by Sonny Curtis,with the exception of ""That'll Be The Day"" which is sung by Jerry Allison. It is interesting to me to hear Sonny's take on the songs, his style is slightly different and some of the arrangements are very different. I have always been a big fan of The Crickets both with and without Buddy Holly and am glad that this album has been re-released, so that I can finally add it to my collection. Hopefully someone will re-release more of their albums as well as some of Sonny Curtis' solo albums."
3,very good for an introduction on the theme,"Economics of Crime by Hellman and Alper is a very good title if you want to start studying the subject of the economic approach of crime. It is very comprehensive (it discusses several kinds of crimes, like theft, murder, prostitution, drugs, etc.), but it has its limitations, since it is made, in the words of the authors, for an ""audience with limited background in economics"". If you have a good knowledge of economic theory, you'll probably find this book too simple. However, if you don't have any knowledge of economics whatsoever, this book may be too difficult for you."
3,Nice and warm. Deadly on ice,"These boots are well made and comfortable. They are reasonably warm, OK down to maybe -10 F, and waterproof as advertised. The zippers work really well.They are great for mud, snow and slush. However, the soles let go entirely as soon as they encounter any ice. My ordinary shoes perform far better. Now I have the choice of dry feet or broken bones."
1,Boots,"Very happen with the purchase process. Very quick and easy to order. Got to me EXTREMELY quick. But, warn them for 5 days and the sole on the left boot is squeeking farely bad. There is no damage whats so ever to the boot or the sole. Took them to a boot repair place and they didnt want to touch them cuz they were too new. Will be contacting the dealer for refund or exchange."
2,Just Ok,Put this together last night. The wood is just ok and it is easy putting this together but with a few flaws. Do yourself a favor and throw the screws away and go to the hardware shop and buy stronger ones. I broke 3 heads off the screws with not much force. I will also need to find some kind of hinge to nail the bottom to the wall because it is only supported by two hanger clips at the top.
1,Never Received Product,"After waiting for 2 weeks, this item still was not ready to ship to me so I cancelled the order."
2,"Tiny size, tiny price, so-so sound, big discomfort","I bought these at the same time as my Riovolt MP3 CD player based nearly on the reputation of Sennheiser alone. I didn't expect much from the included pair of in-ear's and was content with the Sennheiser MX-300's. I got a decent replacement, but there are SO many more good and inexpensive alternatives now, like the MX400/500 for under $20. Considering the price and it's functional purpose (portable), they were a good deal at the time. There can get pretty uncomfortable for listening over an hour however and bass is relatively weak."
3,Mx300,"I ordered two sets of these earphones and have only tried one pair so far. Only one of the ear plugs work on the current set.These earphones can be a little difficult to get to stay in place. I wish they had an ear loop attachment, but for the price I won't complain."
1,Save you Money,I know these are inexpensive and all but they really are that good but i am picky about sound quality and comfort. These are not good in any of the two. I was hoping for better from sennheiser.. I got these free with my apple ipod. The earphones that come with the ipod from apple are awesome i would throw these free ones away.
5,One of my favorite books,The story really has good descriptions(I know because I've been to the light house in the book)and it really makes a picture in your mind of what it would of been like back then!This is one of my favorite books so I would definitely recommend it!
3,old memories,its professional musicans in a relaxed position having a great time.you want to sing along nslap your knees. i heard them in1960s on tv.speacials theyer funnynexciting.
4,Spike Jones for fun,I enjoy the siliness of Spike Jones. We are too serious in the world of today. Listening to him makes you smile and appreciate the simple life
1,Just Plain Awful,"If you enjoy listening to a man getting anally violated with a guitar, then this is the album for you."
4,for those reading this,I was excited to get this because of the song on it featured in the 80s movie secert admirer no secerts the whole cd sounds pretty good I glad i got it for those who don't know check it out
4,Terrific AOR album,"This album is AOR heaven! Van Stephenson and the star cast of session musicians make beautiful melodic rock tunes that are definitely meant to be cranked up. The only minor complaint I have is that sometimes VS seems to sing a little off key, and while he does fill his voice with the right amount of emotion, doesn't have the greatest vocal technique to pull off some parts in some of the songs. But, that is just a minor point. Overall he is awesome, Dann Huff is one of the greatest and most underrated guitarists ever, and ""Suspicious Heart"" is one of the best melodic rock songs, and albums, I have ever heard."
5,Great manual to improve your business!,"This book meets today's employees -- and managers -- where they live every day, and helps them see ways to begin valuing each other and thereby improving the workplace. Today's workers want to contribute and be creative -- if only their managers would let them! And this manual shows how. The transformation from command-and-control to an environment of mutual respect has begun!Marcia Bench, Director, Career Coach Institute"
3,Mist-ical Verse,"This book contains a few gems I had not read before, so I would like to give it a higher rating. However, the literary quality of most of the last half of the book is extremely low, full of tired rhymes and cliches. Much of the ""mysticism"" is of the misty variety, the sort the great mystics are constantly warning against. I would like to have seen the seventeenth century better represented (only two poems by Francis Quarles!). Also, fewer poems than I expected demonstrated a definite religious commitment, Christian or otherwise. I was, however, glad for the token representations of Jewish, Islamic, Hindu & Buddhist perspectives, little as they were."
5,"The Amish community in Daviess county, Indiana",This book arrived very quickly. My sister had this book and I was amazed to find it on Amazon. It arrived in excellent condition. I always expect the best from Amazon... they always come through...
3,Not your typical young adult,"I have always been a huge Shannon Miller fan, admiring not only her athletic achievements but her modesty and level-headedness. Although I found this book interesting, it was not particularly motivational. There is no doubt that Shannon is a very unusual person. But she comes across in this book as too perfect to be true. Also, her reputation for modesty went out the window. How many times do we have to read about all of her ""A"" grades in school? I felt as if I were reading about an android."
5,a GREAT book by Shannon Miller!,"Shannon wrote a very inspiring and motivating book for young adults. She talk about her gymnastics career as well as her personal thoughts. She gives great advice for things such as motivation, eating healthy, discipline, setting goals, having faith, and more! She gives positive advice for a happy, healthy life! There are lots of pictures and even diary entries in this book. This is my favorite book and I'm sure you'll enjoy it too! Way to go Shannon on a GREAT job done!"
5,Wonderful,Loved this book. It is a good inspiration for all people to read. Very easy to read also. Would recommend to everyone.
1,Typical Wright...,"He thinks more highly of his work than his readers do. And God help anyone who criticizes him or disagrees with him. He's infamous for his infantile rants and insults on the web. (As in the below review, posted anonymously, but obviously him.) ""Some people don't get this book..."" he claims. As though the story and it's theme were ""above"" some readers. Perhaps he did a crappy job of telling the story and conveying that theme? The book speaks for itself, regardless of it's inclusion in so- called ""Best of"" lists and claims by the author. Wright has a good imagination and conveys a great sense of atmosphere in his work, he just doesn't know how to deliver the goods. You'll find youself sighing half way through the story and until the very end. If you can finish it."
2,Keyboard is great; Mouse is finicky,"I've had these for about 5 months now. The keyboard always works fine.However, the mouse buttons don't always work, or work very sluggishly on some days. In other words I have to click and hold on an on-screen button in order for it to click though.I'm looking for a replacement now, so I can't say that I recommend it."
1,No point being wireless with absolutely no range.,"The mouse and keyboard do work good... when the base station is no more than 2 feet away that is. I tried moving back from the base station about 3 feet and the keyboard and mouse stopped responding! How could this be? I did read some reviews saying that but didn't believe them. Of course, now I do. Don't buy this if you plan on using this as a wireless keyboard!I have yet to set up the favorites or zoom and it's not for lack of trying either. They just don't work. Oh well, glad I paid less than retail for this thing.But other than those two little things, the keyboard does work but like I said in the title, what's the point in having a wireless keyboard if this things range acts like a wired keyboard???"
3,Good overall,"Good overall keyboard - great for the price. Nice for those of us with larger hands, though the mouse is a bit small for mine (very large hands). Very occasionally doesn't pick up typing."
1,ms-wireless keyboard combo w/laser mouse,"Bought this to use on my main computer. Easy to install but hotkeys didn't work also a magnifier or zoom. My old pc needed a keyboard so I installed it down there and I got a Logitech instead. I wish I had this review first, it would saved me money."
4,PC Good,"Works great with a PC and Windows7 -- the correct drivers are automatically installed.A great replacement for my former Logitech combo, which had funky drivers."
1,Sluggish Mouse on Mac,"I have the receiver set up on a kvm switch for a PC and a Mac. The combo works great on the PC but the mouse is very sluggish on the Mac. I also get nfrequest ""low wireless signal"" message on the Mac (not on PC). All in all, too much of a hassle and I will be returning it."
1,Third one to fail in less than two months! GARBAGE!,"I purchased four of these wireless laser desktops for Apple computers. One for home, and three for work. Out of four, three have failed within two months. The mouse has multiple problems. The wheel gets stuck and begins to ""drag"" and is difficult to scroll with. The left and right mouse buttons begin acting strangely, performing double clicks on a single click, or not clicking at all. The keyboard keys have had problems as well (not responding without having to press them very hard on certain keys. I'd say they have a useful life on no more than two months.I will be submitting a complaint to Amazon. If you choose to purchase this kit... hold on to your receipt and all the packaging! Personally I would look elsewhere!"
2,Low signal strength issues,"As several people have pointed out, the keyboard popup indicates low keyboard signal strength even with new batteries and close proximity to the USB receiver. I searched for posts on this issue on the Internet, and it amazes me that this issue has been reported on MS-wireless keyboards for well over a year.I guess I shouldn't be surprised, this is a Microsoft product and they continue to sell it - no wonder it's discounted heavily.The keyboard does work fine inspite of the signal strength issues, but I find it a tad clumsy."
2,Unusable wireless signal,"I received the order timely and in good condition. The setup was intuitive and easy. The keyboard seem ergonomic and stylish. HOWEVER, once set up, the wireless signal was uselessly weak -- to the point that the key board would not work on my keyboard tray less than 24"" away from the receiver unit. The receiver unit has a long cord and theoretically could be extended closer to the keyboard, however that essentially defeats the point of a wireless unit and would have created wired clutter on the desktop. The receiver unit is surprisingly large -- larger than the mouse itself! I have used another Microsoft wireless keyboard (Microsoft Natural 7000) and it works much better, and has a much more compact USB receiver. In fact, I simply installed the MAC version of the 7000 driver and now use the 7000 keyboard. I would absolutely NOT recommend this keyboard unless the keyboard unit itself will be within 12"" of the receiver unit."
2,great - but then....,"Love this thing ergonomically, but the damn thing is unreliable. Left (and only really important button) on mouse is failing after just a few months. which makes it unusable. The keyboard also seems finicky despite putting in new batteries all the time. I am not a heavy user. Since they are coupled this would require me to buy the set all over again. NEver liked microsoft but thought i would give them a try."
5,LL Bust Out L7,"Ahead of times;behind the times; nostalgic;uber-hip; labels labels labels; the key thing is whether you will like it and if you like Lisa Lisa's classic voice and delivery then this CD is for you. No square sounds on this CD and though its not pop like her old school its suprisingly new and improved. It's jammin on all cylinders and makes you wish she had continued her solo career because she really delivers with all the verve of yesteryear but showcases her ability to do it in evey contemporary context. Some fine ear wine with LL aged over time makin this solo solo a real crime. Agreed, this is great grown folks music."
3,illy Caffe Scuro Espresso pods,"Coffee was good, but not quite as good as the price would have led me to believe. But then again, all the coffees of this kind, including the pods have gotten very expensive and takes away from the convenience of using them. For a special occasion, it is fine, but for everyday use, I would try an alternative."
2,ok,"this pair of headphones is alright, beacuse it is so light and the sound is kind of fuzzy, i would recommend spending a couple extra bucks."
5,Blind Pig Records 30th Anniversary Collection,Well packaged and the quality of the recordings were excellent. I love the old Blues and was not disappointed in the selection of songs and artists on the CDs. I'm happy to have them as part of my collection and will enjoy them for many years to come.
3,First songs on each CD the best,"Just as with the 25th anniversary Collection, the first song on each CD was by far the best. There seemed a lot more filler on this this one but the songs that were good were really good. Overall a very good Blues collection if you just skip over 3 or 4 of the tracks."
2,Could of been better,"The highlights for me were"" Nickel and a nail"" by Otis Rush, and a duet by Delbert Mcclinton and Renee Austin called ""Pretend we never met"". The DVD extra was nice if only to Tommy Castro the rest was not so hot."
5,One of the better metal bands out there.,"They simply kick! Too bad they didn't get much coverage, cuz they rule. ""Sole Survivor"" and ""perfect Gentleman"" are some of the best songs I've ever heard. Believe me, this albums worth it"
3,"Out of date, but still useful","In about 2001, GSUSA updated Daisy Girl Scouts to include Promise petals, awards earned by learning about the promise. However, a lot of the activities and ideas in this older edition are still fun and useful for your Daisy Girl Scouts."
5,Haunting and beautiful,"In this slender volume, justly hailed as a wonder by several reviewers, Judy Jordan crafts the most beautiful, thought-provoking and elegiac poetry out of the less promising circumstances - poverty, alcoholism, murder and death - and gives us lines we aren't likely to forget.I came upon this book by pure chance, and I'm happy I did. Despite her often dismal subject matter, Judy Jordan is a joy to read. Get the book now, thank me later!"
4,Peni,"A great mystery. Funny, keeps you not wanting to put it down. The characters are perfect. An easy but entertaining read. Makes you want to read all her books."
3,OK but not great,"I found the book mildly entertaining but confusing - the plot was not memorable, and I can't remember how it ended!"
5,Great Sound,Good sound quality for the price. I liked it better than my Sony and Koss earphones so I got 2 more. Need I say more?
2,Too Big- They Hurt,"These are too big to fit in my ears- after a few minutes they hurt. So it does not matter how good they sound, I may have small ears."
3,You Get What You Pay For...,"I had high hopes for these ear buds, but was alittle disappointed. Yes, they are smaller than the iPod earbuds and I really appreciate that (since the iPod buds were too big for my ears). But the sound quality is average. Cannot handle much bass, if any, and the overall sound has too much mid and highs. I still use them, since I haven't replaced them yet. But my search continues...."
1,It's not worth the money,I bought Sennheiser MX400 and a Sony MDR-E828 and the Sony sounds way better at a cheaper price. Just buy the Sony. I read earlier comment but was disappointed when i got them. Good luck....
1,Can't rate the sound because they don't stay in my ears,"I have no idea whether these earphones have good sound quality because I can't keep them in my ears for more than 2 seconds, even when sitting perfectly still. They are pictured with foam covers, and other raters have mentioned them, but I didn't get any. It is impossible to keep these earphones in your ears without the covers. I would be very grateful if someone could tell me where to find the foam covers."
2,Brand name didn't keep up with competition,"This is a standard ""Made in China"" earbud. Not worth any premium dollars. Works as advertised, but overpriced.At least they could put the brand in larger letters for the money!"
4,Sennheiser MX-400 In-Ear Headphones,"i bought these things to replace the ipod headphones, and i have to say i'm very impressed. they fit comfortably and they sound great. my only complaint is that they don't handle base in certain songs very well. i'm not sure why, but its only a minor setback"
2,4 Months and it's broken!,Pretty disappointing actually.. I bought this product for the brand name and the earphones just stopped working after just 4 months. I have used sennheiser before and I was satisfied.. I hope the company takes down products like these..
2,Real Sennheisers?,"I bought 2 of these from woot.com for about $12 to $15. So $7.50 each. I'm not sure they are real Sennheisers. They may be counter fits. First because they came in vacuum sealed bags. Second because of their sound quality. Some of the other reviews here on Amazon make me think some people are receiving real Sennheisers, and others are getting either b-stock or counterfeit models.They don't sound bad, but don't sound as good as I would expect from Sennheiser. Clearly at this price point they aren't supposed to be high end. But I would rate them slightly below the standard Apple ear buds that come with iPods.The Sennheiser's have a little less bass, and more forward highs. The stronger highs make the less bass seem even weaker. For $7.50 they work as extra ear bugs to be laying around or used at the gym."
2,"Great case, poor sound","I bought several ear buds for my wife's iPod because she was uncomfortable wearing the stock earbuds. Sennheiser always has had a good reputation and these got good reviews. She didn't like any of the options and prefers lightweight over the ear headphones so we put them away. I then bought an iPod and tried the different options that I bought for her. These produce a very muddy sound. By far the best are the Creative EP-630s. I now use those and store them in the Sennheiser case which is a great design and prevents cord tangle.If the carrying case comes with these ear buds (and some reviews say that it didn't), I'd buy them because the case is worth $10.00."
1,I cannot believe this is a Sennheiser product.,"The product does not come in a case as displayed in the picture. It actually came in a bag. The sound is extremely poor, just like the headphones you might get for free on a plane flight."
4,Sennheiser MX-400 In-Ear Headphones,These have good sound. The buds are slightly smaller than the iPod earbuds.
4,Decent Pair of Earbuds,"The good: They're lightweight and give decent audio quality. They don't fall out easily, for me anyway.The bad: the bass is no better than most other earphones I have tried, the In-Ear earbuds are much better if u don't mind shoving a piece of rubber in your ear."
4,sennheiser mx-400 in-ear headphones,"these are great, so much better than the earbuds that come with apple ipods, minimal distortion. i am so happy with these."
4,Great Price!,"These are great replacements for the ipod's white ear buds. The ipod's packed in buds were too big for my ears and hurt so much when I would listen to my ipod. The MX-400's are smaller and sound a lot better and are more comfortable. As other reviews stated these have more bass than the packed in ipod ear buds. They are great and you can't beat that price-$14! The case is convenient too, you can roll up your ear buds from the bottom swivel mechanism. Great Buy you won't regret."
5,Great earphone,"I used mx400 when I bought Iriver mp3 player(they give with the player) and it was very impressive. First the base is really good, it has no cracks or other noises. also it doesn't break easily, and cheap, but sounds better than my other earphones that are more expensive, I think. I recommend this cause it's pretty worthy to buy."
4,"Sound good, but they're still buds","They sound great, but they're annoying to wear as it's hard to keep them well-seated in your ears. When they shift around they don't sound as good. This is a problem with all buds of this design though, so if you're aware of that, these sound excellent for the price."
3,"Not bad, not great","These are well made, nice earphones. They sound great, but only if you can stick them right up in your ear. If they sit loosely in your ear, they sound kind of tiny. For me, they don't stay in when exercising and pop out easily. Because of this, I've already lost both foam covers.In summary, these are great earphones if you can get them to stick and stay in your ear. But, I wouldn't recommend them for people with big mickey mouse ears like me."
5,These buds sound terrific.,"My SanDisk m230 512mb mp3 player has an equalizer feature. With it these buds sound great, with plenty of bass.They come with a solid carrying case. Very happy with this purchase."
3,Not long enough Cord,The pic that is displayed is kind of misleading. The length of the cord is less and there is not a big use of wind-up case.But Output wise cannot ask for more especially for the price. Just go for it.
1,Not Sennheiser quality,"These headphones sound very tinny with little bass. The sound is also not clear and a lot of static comes through. I would not buy these again, and will probably just trash them!"
2,"All hype, poor sound","Encouraged by all the rave reviews, I bought the mx400 at the airport recently to replace my old wearing out Sony earbuds (can't recall the model, but it was their low-end $9.99 one). Honestly, I am quite disappointed in these mx400. In my opinion, the bass is very weak and the treble is overemphasized. Even playing with the EQ on my portable player didn't help much. I do realize these are an entry level model, but still, compared to my old buds, the mx400 sound inferior and unbalanced. If you want reasonable bass, look elsewhere."
3,A terrifc bargain,"Why oh why do people spend $50, $80, even $100 for earphones? For the very sane sum of $15 or so I get very decent sound. Okay, this is not audiophile sound, but I'm walking the streets of New York City where noisy vehicles and nearby conversations constantly intrude. There's no way anyone can possibly listen at audiophile level in that environment. On the earphones themselves, I could not get the foam pads to stay on and they consequently do not lock in place 100% of of the time. For the most part, however, they stay where I put them and I hear every note, every instrument and every song perfectly. The coil device to store the cord is a waste when you can simply wrap the wire around your iPod or MP3 device."
1,pretty bad sound....,"I compared a bunch of low price earbuds using my daughters 1st gen ipod, my sons zune, and my recently acquired 2nd gen touch with consistent results for all earbuds tested.This model has splashy smeared highs that after some amount of listening is fatiguing. Don't know what the folks who praise the sound of these are listening to, but then also I can't fathom why budwieser is the most popular beer.The Sony MDR-E828LP was the best sounding headphone of the bunch I tested by quite a margin. The Sony has clearer (much less smeared) highs and sounds more musical giving a sense of air/sound stage. Slight emphasis on the low end but its not too bad. Get those, don't waste your ears on these."
4,"It's Good, It's Cheap","It's probably one of the better earphones you can get for cheap. It has almost no bass but vocals are nice and sound is clear and crisp. It wont be the best earphones you have ever heard, but they are nice."
3,"Sound great, but...","These things immediately impressed me with their sound, but would fall out of my ears easily, and also left my ears feeling raw. I replaced them with a behind-the-neck phones, and am very happy with them."
4,Great value,"I got these earbuds after reading good reviews on bulletin boards for my Creative Zen Micro, and I would agree that the sound quality is excellent. I'm not a huge audiophile, but I can say that the trebles are crisp, and the bass is rich. The only negative is that the buds are a little big for my ears, such that they tend to fall out easily. Overall, though, a great value at $10!"
5,Great Deal - Solid High Quality Headphones,These are high quality headphones and I have no problems with them. They sound great and work well with my Sandisk mp3 player.
3,Nothing special,"But is good for the price. Has a wide range, but does not emphasis the bass which I like. But for a good accurate sound, it is a good set for the price"
5,Fantastic sound quality through these earbuds,"I purchased these to replace earphones that came with a highend mp3 player, and find the sound output on these MX400's superb. I highly recommend. Another point of praise, the cords after a couple months of use remain flexible and have not tangled. The foam covers fell off and I had to purchase new ones. Other than that issue, I feel good about the quality and price."
3,OK ear bud but prefer Koss,"I have used three different in-ear headphones: MX-400, Koss ""The Plug,"" and Shure 2c. Shure 2c is in a different price league and is noticeably better in sound and build quality. Between MX-400 and Koss ""The Plug"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00081A2DQ/sr=1-2/qid=1134499532/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-9512091-3435233?%5Fencoding=UTF8), I would much prefer ""The Plug"" with the mod described on http://www.headwize.com/projects/showfile.php?file=cmoy4_prj.htm. With the mod, ""The Plug"" becomes a very comfortable sound isolating in-ear monitor. The sound quality, especially the low end, is much better represented than MX-400. The thin foam covers of the MX-400 is another problem. They easily fall off and break. Unless you are willing to pay for Shure 2c, go for the Koss earbud with the easy mod."
4,"Very durable, slightly tinny tone",This drum is very durable. I've found my lightweight six year old using it as a step stool once or twice with no ill effects to the drum.The drum has a slightly tinny tone. Serious musician parents or drum teachers might not be happy with that.
5,great drum!,"My 21 month old loves this drum. I will say though, for the first two weeks when he was over the top obessed with it I was shootin myself in the foot for buying him this thing! Great toy, great size, great durability :)"
2,my 16 month old daughter loves it,I bought this drum for my daughter for Christmas. She goes to a music class & they have drums there that as very similar. This drum is well made & solid. My daughter loves it & plays with it every day. Much better quality than the toy drums that you get in the toy stores.
5,Love this show,Good content and characters keep my kids interested and gets them active. Can't wait till it becomes back available for order. I wish this show was on tv more but I haven't seen it for awhile.
4,Great for the price - a few drawbacks,"There are a few drawbacks. The motor noise mentioned in other reviews is a real problem - it's a loud whine and hiss, really annoying. I almost sent the camera back because of this alone so be warned. There is no Firewire cable included, you have to get one before you can transfer video to the computer. No video software is included but since I am using Kino in Ubuntu Linux, it wasn't an issue. In Linux, it's extremely easy to transfer to Kino, edit, and burn to DVD using K3b. (don't forget in Ubuntu you have to run it as root - 'gksudo kino'). Kino controls the camera through the DV interface, playback, edit, export to DVD. Haven't tried anything more complicated than that yet. Controls are nice and picture and sound quality quite good."
3,"OK Camcorder, Not Great","The price was nice but the buttons hard to use and the zoom difficult to use while holding the camera by the strap. Good time on battery. Just FYI, you have to have a firewire cable to transfer video to computer, get one online much cheaper. Also make sure you have a firewire connection to pc or you also will have to get a firewire card which you can also get online cheaply. Video good quality and sound good."
5,Canon ZR850 1MP MiniDV Camcorder with 35x Optical Zoom,This camcorder is great. I had an earlier version of it and like this one better. Picture quality is good and easy to use. glad i bought it.Canon ZR850 1MP MiniDV Camcorder with 35x Optical Zoom
2,I would not recommend this to anyone,"I had this Camcorder for about 5 days before I returned it. After recording one tape I decided to watch the footage to see what kind of quality it had. The video quality was outstanding but the audio was not. The motor in the camcorder puts off a quite hum which you don't pay any mind because it's very faint. However, the internal microphone picks up this hum and records it. I love everything else about the camcorder. But in my opinion the motor noise is just not expectable for something of this price range."
4,ZR 850 Good Camcorder no Documention,"The camcorder is used by the Wood Turners club for demonstrations video and displayed on a large TV. The picture quality is very good. I had to purchase a seperate video cord to transfer the picture to the TV which I knew was not provided. The menu for setting up the camcorder is fairly straight forward, however if the supplyer had provided documentation with the camcorder, it would have been easer to set up. I had assumed that documentaion would be included. Don't assume anything."
5,"""Another Amazing Effort!!!""","Jane Candia Coleman has once again put forth an amazing work of literature! As with all of her previous novels (Desperate Acts, Doc Holliday's Woman, Doc Holliday's Gone, etc...) she paints as powerful a picture as any author around. Her story based on Allie Earp's REAL memoirs is without a doubt a breath of fresh air that has been needed for a long time. Now everyone should be able to completely forget the real ""Tombstone Travesty"" which was Frank Waters' original work supposedly on this same topic!Congratulations, Jane!"
1,Worst movie ever!,"It is so bad that I have a thing I do with it.I ask someone whats the worst movie they have ever seen and not really caring what they answer I then say it's credits were far superior to this movie. I inform people this is the worst movie I have ever seen and everyone who watched it has agreed. It has not been dethroned. I then suggest that people watch it so they can say they watched the worst movie ever. I go on to tell them that once they watch it they have the right to make others watch it. Alot of people I know have suffered through this based on that...My one friend baught his copy for $0.75 and said he over paid... I purchased mine for 7.99 or something like that, and I consider it a very cheap form of torture that has paid for it's self many times over"
1,Low Budget / High Price,"I don't get why such low budget movies like ""Zombies Gone Wild"" cost so much to order. From what I've been reading in these reviews, this dvd should cost about $5.99 not $19.98. Come on Amazon! How about a price recalibration to reflect the original film budget!"
1,Go buy a burrito instead,"As another said & I didnt read ahead of time, this movie doesnt even deserve 1 star. When are people going to realize that acting like a retard does NOT make a movie funny. Blow up dolls do NOT make a movie funny. Seriously, when they finally meet the 3 girls at the community park by the pond, is the one in the middle deaf or from Eastern Europe? I couldnt tell. The white guy who played several roles including a black man & in the same persona an Indian (dot, not feather). Cant make up your mind? Who's mom played the mom at the beginning? I paid $2.47 for the movie & another $2.98 for shipping. I cant ever get this time or money back. I LOVE b-movies & have over 600 of them. I honestly cant come up with any words to describe just how horrible this movie is. The end was everyone discussing their pay before walking off. Nothing was clever or even remotely humorous. A frozen burrito is more appealing, seriously. Dont bother."
1,Avoid,"I'm a huge fan of low budget horror. Regardless, though, of whether a movie is huge or low budget, it must have certain characteristics to make it enjoyable, such as a decent plot, good camera work, good acting, interesting characters, etc. This movie has none of those elements. In fact, the majority of the film is shot inside a van, and with a Walmart quality consumer camcorder. The plot is stupid, the acting horrible, and the image quality so bad its distracting. I'm embarrassed for the director and producer that they would issue something this terrible. I love movies, and they're a great form of escapism, and I tend to have a very flexible standard. However, time is short and precious, and I'd rather spend my time watching movies that at least have something redeeming. Not so here."
1,A review from Zombie-Nation!,"I am going to forego my regular review format, as I find that it isn't necessary.No comments on actors, production or special effects.Just know that this movie is one of the BIGGEST pieces of crap to have ever graced a DVD. There simply is NO reason to watch this movie. Everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) about this movie is complete and utter garbage. An insult to the genre. Even the director / writer was embarrassed by it and only used his initials. You would be better off to just stare at a blank t.v. screen for 102 minutes. Seriously.Amazon really needs to add a ""No Star"" option."
1,Don't even rent this trash.,"As these movies are typically made by some small studio trying to be creative in the genre while working with an extremely small budget, I ordinarily approach zombie movies like this with a large degree of suspended disbelief. In this case, my suspended disbelief lasted only thirty minutes before I had to turn off the movie.This is not an example at even an honest effort at a good B-movie. No attempt was made at lighting, no attempt was made at audio, no attempt was made at acting. This ""movie"" looks like a bunch of guys got together on a weekend and shot this thing with a five year old mini-cam. I created better productions than this when I was in high school. After patiently enduring more than thirty minutes of college kids talking about getting some trim, waiting and hoping that the emergence of zombies would redeem this movie, no zombies came and I turned the film off."
1,"101 minutes of my life, gone","OK, I don't mind bad movies; in fact I rather enjoy them. This one was bad, and I mean real bad. But I decided to watch it all the way through. There was a storyline, so just as the movie is about to reach its climax, it turns into a crew and cast get together. Everyone comes out of character, the crew is on film, and the story never ends. It may have been conceived as being ""original"" or ""clever""; to me it turned the entire experience into a joke. A joke on me, as they got my money for a product, and did not provide that complete product to me.I wish we could offer negative reviews."
4,scholarly yet readable,"This is great. It's intelligent, makes-sense stuff. While most academics handle this kind of content in a verbose, scholarly, i've-got-a-big-vocabulary-and-fiddly-style way, Drane's language is clear and simple.I read an earlier edition, and the layout of the book was great too. It's in that magazine-style with big pictures, interesting insets, good headings. You can pick and choose what to read if you're keen for a browse, or eat it all up. I was surprised with the quality of the content, upon first glance at the layout you think it must be quite elementary - but it's not. It's good stuff.The copy I read was from the library - now it's on my wish-list (mom)."
5,If I could give it 10 stars I would,"There's already a great review by G. Merrit of this book so all I want to do is to add my praise. The poem ""St. Francis and the Sow"" and the commentary by Housden is perhaps the most beautiful, life affirming, soul enriching text I have ever read in my life. To me it is ""sacred text"". I want to send a copy of it to every one I've ever loved, liked, hated or sat across from on a bus!I am new to poetry - I've wanted to be interested in it and I've enjoyed it when it was quoted by others - but I never found it accessible. Housden's commentary has remedied that. But beyond that, Housden's books are more than commentary on poetry. They are the best books on spirituality, life, humanness, God, i.e. the ""important topics"" that I have ever read in my life. Thank you, Roger Housden, for opening this wonderful world to me."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"This was THE WORST ""movie"" that we have ever seen. I am so glad that we only spent $1 renting this movie. If you have not purchased this movie, don't think about doing so. If you have not seen this move, you haven't missed a thing. This movie was a collection of unrelated characters with a storyline so loose and disjointed that you spent the entire movie attempting to figure out what was happening. No character development, no storyline backdrop or development, nothing about this film was worth watching. How did it make it to production? Malik Yoba has appeared in pretty good works, so we were shocked to see him associated with this garbage. Unbelievable that this mess was produced for public consumption."
4,Familiar Love,A successful young man with an ambitious overbearing girlfriend falls prey to his own feelings. The feelings are for his past love or love he lost (so to speak). She and he seem to have a most natural love unlike the fake and forced relationship he has with his current girlfriend. It all works out in the end. I liked it.
4,"Shorter than it looks, but packs a punch.","True, this book talks about something that you just don't find in other books, and I'm very happy I bought it. But don't be decived. The real content of the book is only about 30 pages in length. The rest of the book is devoted to ""sign names"" which are basically the same signs except different letters of the alphabet.I was hoping for more content. However, it is still a very good choice for anyone seriously interested in ASL."
4,Ride the Wind,Good movie about a comeback to win The Motorcycle Nationals.Wish the ending would have told more.Just be sure you own a VCR player. It came to be in VHS.
4,Army Men Rewiev,"This is a cool game, although, since the soldiers are ""plastic"" you'd expect your house to be the center, not some plastic homeland, but the whole game has been concepted very well, the physical system is accordingly working (which i didn't expect) and the whole atmosphere is filled(no, not only with scent of plastic) with scent of action!"
4,Great jewelry box!,"Lots of space for all my jewelry and compartments to keep everything organized. Keeps the silver from tarnishing! Wish the box could be a little less bulkier though. Otherwise, great product!"
3,small Sterling Silver Jewelry Box,"This is a nice jelewry box but it is smaller than I thought. It is designed mostly to hold earrings, there isn't much room for necklaces. If you need something to keep earrings in and not to tarnish, this would be perfect. It is also very pretty. It just isn't designed to hold larger items, as I thought it was from the pictures."
4,jewelery box,"Bought as a gift for my wife and she loved it. For the price it is a great item, but the little pullout drawer could have been desighned differently, if you want to pick upthe box the drawer could fallout if you are not careful."
5,Great gift,This was a gift to my wife and she loved it. The coloring finish and the wood look very nice from outside and she has enough space inside for fitting her jewellery for now ;)
4,"Nice box, could be a bit bigger","This is great for keeping sterling silver so as not to be constantly cleaning. The drawer for necklaces is a bit narrow and bangle or cuff bracelets can't fit. The workmanship is good also, but the knob for the drawer could have been bigger."
2,get what you pay for,"For the price, I can't complain too much. If you want to spend less than ten bucks for a case shipped to you, I'm sure you could do a lot worse. That said here's my breakdown:PROS:Good overall fit - nice and tight, not too tight that its impossible to get offGood grip - good textured areas on the sides make the phone less slipperyVery cheapCONS:Feels cheap - materials do not feel high quality, seams look bad, rough edges everywhereKickstand is flimsy - difficult to get it to lock shut or open, have doubts about its long term reliabilityCutouts not properly aligned - nothing completely off, but nothing is centered up right. I was especially worried about the mic hole at the bottom as it rides right up against the cutout instead of being centered.If you are not picky about cases and just want some cheap protections with a kickstand, this will definitely do. I prefer something a little higher quality and think a phone like the Note 2 deserves it."
2,Dont buy these if you like to listen to loud music.,"These earphones are okay, but they don't have good sound quality. The ear pads on them rip or fall off all the time. They also are big and don't fit snuggly in regular sized ears. I reccomend to buy a different pair. Oh yeah, the cord isn't very long either."
3,Earhugger Review,"These are good earphones, although the tone quality isnt as good as I would expect it to be. I recomend these earphones if you dont want to spend the extra bucks on all those high tech headphones."
2,"Good sound, but amazingly uncomfortable","Regardless of Sennheiser's consistent pension for making wonderful sounding headphones, these are so uncomfortable that it cannot justify the purchase. Go with the Sony Earbud Headphones (MDR-EX70LP) and you will be much happier (search around for prices)."
3,Excellent value but sound quality disappointing,"Perhaps I placed too much hope on these headphones from reading the rave customer reviews but the earbuds were disappointing.The Good Stuff:1. Cord length (not too short or long)2. Delivers good enough surround sound for earbuds3. Volume control on cord (especially if you have your player away from your immediate person in backpack or purse)4. Decent bass5. Price (can't be beat!)The Bad Stuff:1. Music tends to sound a little muddled2. Fit (keeps falling out of my ears)3. Wish it had a gold plated stereo plug4. Feels a bit plasticky5. Does not block out enough external noise (I have to turn my music way up in public areas or on public transportation)Overall, these are good stopover headphones as I make my way (and save up cash) towards earbuds like the Shure E2c or the Etys ER-6."
4,Better than the MX-400's,"I listen to jazz so my comments are related to this type of music. The MX-500's provide a very good sound when you set your iPod equilizer to ""flat"". Most other settings result in a sound that is overly bright, not natural. The MX-500 do not provide any relief from the sounds around you (unless you turn up the volume pretty high). All that said, I do like the MX-500 better than the ear buds that came with my iPod.I bought the MX-400's also (one of those Amazon buy two and save deals). These ear buds do not sound better than the ear buds that come standard with an iPod."
3,Good sound quality but lacks Bass,"Very clear sound but like all the earbuds I've tried theyhave very little bass response, they also are a little too largeto fit in my ear for long, after 30 mins they become uncomfortable.I have the same problem with the Creative Labs buds too."
2,"Not great, not good","These earphones are not secure in the ear, having a tendency to just fall out. The sound quality is OK, just OK, so look further before opting for these."
2,I'd assumed the Sennheiser name actually meant something,"I ordered these earbuds along with the (admittedly more expensive) PX-100 headphones. The MX-500s just don't compare. I love the carrying case, and wish these sounded better, as I wanted to use them at the gym. I still may, I haven't decided yet.They just don't sound very good. They don't have the punch or clarity that the PX-100s have. They sound tinny, and the music lacks any sort of power.On the other hand the PX-100s are amazing, even though the form factor isn't as convenient as the MX-500s. I even recommend the PX-100s over the PX-200s I've owned for a while."
3,Concur w/ other reviewers - Lower Bass,"I just received these earbuds after my Sony earbuds (similar price and comparable to these Mx-500s) died after 2yrs. As with other reviewers, if you want a good Bass response, these are probably not the buds for you (go with the Sonys or get the ""plug"" or ""spark plug"". I'm not an audiophile by any means, so I cannot speak to the sound ""quality"". But for the low price, I'm not expecting much. Comfort wise they are about the same as my old Sonys, hopefully they'll last longer than 2 years."
3,Not an acceptable iPod replacement,"Based on the reviews here, I bought these headphones to replace a pair of stock iPod headphones that were falling apart. I was disappointed. Compared to the iPod headphones, the Sennheisers are tinny and tight. They have very little bass response and the sound is not very full. It seemed like I was listening to an old tape player. I give these headphones three stars instead of two because they're so cheap. I'm going to try and get a bit more life out of the iPod headphones. If they break, I'll just spend $40 for a new pair of those. It'll be well worth it."
3,OK for the money,"These earphones are OK sonically. Not worse than you'd expect for $10. The bass response is nominal but I can tell that they are capable of good bass *if* you have large ear canals - I don't - and get them deep enough into your ear canal. This is apparent when you put some pressure on them while they're in your ears - the bass increases dramatically. Unfortunately, I cannot maintain that state. Volume is very good and the volume control (attenuator) works nicely. The cord could be a little longer. Overall you could do much worse. Recommended."
4,A good earphone without enough bass,"Well, I am not a bass friend but I would like to get more bass from this ear.IMHO, this earphone is over-rated. This is a very popular and good earphone and it get a broad recognized. I am a music friend who writes electronic equipments test report. I deal with many music players and earbuds. This earphone is good for those people who enjoy pure music. If you love R&B; and Rap... A Sony one with close price would be your choice.This earphone is also getting a high recognition in some Chinese forums (I'm from China so I know it), but I guess it is just a good choice due to its cheaper price and acceptable quality. Generally if you good for price and you do not care much about bass, this would be a good choice.I am buying another MX-400 from Sennheiser and I will let you guys know how I think about that one later on."
4,A good value,"Pros:Specs are Sennheiser-worthy: 18 to 22,000 Hz frequency responseBlue to throw off the iPod muggers (white screams ""here's an expensive device that's easy to carry and easy to fence"")Convenient wind-up case to prolong cord life and minimize storage spaceCheapCons:Not for those who look for the phrase ""thunderous bass"" in their headphone reviewsNot the best bang for the buck (but close)"
4,Best sub $20 earbuds,"Clear sound, good bass. The volume slider is convenient. My only complaint is that the foam bud covers tend to fall off easily (e.g. when you store the ear bugs in your pocket) so there's a good chance of losing them. The foam covers *do* make a difference in sound -- depending on your ears you'll either perceive it as more bass, or slightly muffled bass."
2,Not a good one,"I don't know if this is a bad design or I just have my bad luck getting a defect one. When I walk around with this stuff on, I can hear a very disturbing noise. Later I find out the earphone actually delivers and amplifies the friction noise between its cord and the zipper on my jacket to my ears! You can avoid this problem by being static (people alive won't always be static), or by wearing soft material clothing with no zipper.Other pros and cons.Pros:Decent sound qualityBuilt in volumn contolCons:ugly looking except the sennheiser brand on ituncomfortable earbud (too large)"
3,sennheiser mx500 are fakes-beware,"My daughter just received her new Sennheiser mx500 earbuds. She is satisfied with the sound, but they are clearly fakes! The cords are two different lengths, the jack has a gold tip, not like is pictured on the Amazon listing, which then came from TigerDirect. They were not in a package, no guarantee, etc. BEWARE FAKES!!!!!"
4,Good sound for an earbud.,These have really good sound for an earbud. The earbud itself is a little large and after wearing them for a while they start to hurt somewhat. The sound beats almost all of sony's earbuds.
2,"If you're looking for BASS, don't stop here...","Bought these about a month or so ago because I was looking for a replacement for the standard iPOD ear buds, and I really wanted ones with some decent response. After some research, I chose these. After use with a variety of music types, EQ settings and the like, they pretty much have WORSE bass response than the earbuds that came with the iPOD.Otherwise the sound quality is good, and they have a nifty carrying case...but...I'm not using them."
3,Great value - Served the purpose well,"I am not a headphone buff. I needed a replacement pair of earbuds for my iPod mini and didn't want to spend a lot of money. After researching, I found these to be the best buy, and I haven't been disappointed. They are better than the original iPod mini headphones (Apple wanted $40 for those!). Are they heavy on bass? Probably not as heavy as some would like, but to me they're good enough, and the audio is quite good. I like the volume control on the cord. Yes, the cord is short for those wanting to jog or exercise, but for me, I'm sitting at work with them on and the length is fine. The only complaint I have is that the buds are a touch on the large side. I have pretty big ears, and I find that these do occasionally fall out with a lot of movement. So if you're an active person when wearing earbuds, these may not be for you."
4,Nice Headphones,"Nice Sound, Good Bass, slightly better then stock IPod headphones.Can't beat them for the price + Amazon's quick delivery!"
4,good value,"i bought this due to the large number of positive reviews. i do say i must agree. for about $12, this is a great set of earphones. definitely superior in terms of sound quality and comfort to the earphones that come w/ the ipods. the volumn ctrl comes in quite handy, although i wish the ctrl can turn the volume down all the way. i use the volume ctrl the most when i snowboard. easy to turn it up and down even w/ gloves on!the bass could be a little better, but can't complain much considering this is earphones. mid to high range sounds is very clear. overall a great product."
4,Great earbuds for the price!,"I got these earphones primarily for the in-line volume control and the wind up case. When I fly, I like to listen to music on my PDA and on those very long flights, I like to watch the occassional DVD. Before the MX-500, I simply had a cheap pair of philips earbuds that worked okay. I didn't realize how poor the quality was until I got my MX-500. Much fuller bass and still very comfortable (I chose not to use the pads that came with it). My only criticism is that the wire is sometimes too short at 3 ft. Of course, if they were much longer, I'd be complaining about how long it was..."
3,"Compared to other earbuds for the price, these compete well.","This review is for the Sennheiser MX-500 Stereo In-Ear Headphones (Blue) when used with a Dell laptop (Crystal WDM Audio). I disagree with a lot of folks who have compared these decent earbuds with dis-similar products. I did a comparison with a pair of Panasonic RP-HC50 earbuds my pal had and the Sennheiser won.PROS: Frequency response is excellent (18Hz-25000Hz) for a variety of music. There is no manipulation to the sound and you hear the original notes with the same treble and bass.CONS: Bass could have been a little more improved. Some distortion in lower frequency ranges, but only noticeable in very clear (and high bitrate) audio files. Higher frequencies tend to produce a slight hiss, again mostly noted in high bit-rate audio files.Overall good buds at a slight premium (20%)."
4,Love them!,"I ordered a set of these for each member of my family for Christmas. We all have mp3 players and had been using the ""stock"" headphones. I have did a little research before choosing these and have been extremely pleased with the quality. I workout often and wear an armband to hold my ipod so the volume control is hard to get to. These headphones make that issue a thing of the past. They have a volume control slider located on the headphone wire so I can easily adjust the volume if needed without removing my ipod from the armband. The sound quality is about an 80% improvement over the ""stock"" ipod headphones and I am very happy with my purchase (and the great price!)"
4,The volume control is great,"The sound quality is great (much better than the regular iPod earphones) and the price is not that high. Plus, the external volume control is great. I amply recommend these."
3,Terribly Uncomfortable,"I don't really have an opinion about the sound quality of these ear buds. They were so uncomfortable that I tossed them in the ""Box of Misfit Toys"" after an hour of very uncomfortabe listening. The ear piece is the same basic design as the default Apple earbuds, but they feel larger in the ear."
3,resasonable price for this type of earphone,"Sennheiser is brand name company for headphone. The price is attractive, but the packet dispointed me. It looks just too cheapI Because my expection is a little high, the sound is so so, but for this price, you can't expect more.Anyway, it is good one for ordinary customer. Absolutely not for music fan!"
1,Cord is too short!,"Decent enough headphones, sound is fine. But the cord isn't long enough tor each from my ears to my pockets! So they're useless to me."
2,It's cheap. Only cheap.,"I bought this pair and returned after one-day try.This pair is so cheap that you can't beat the price. However, you also can't expect the performance. The sound really disppoints me. I had SONY MDR-888SP, which is among the top pair. The reason I bought this one is because my MDR-888 is sort cord and I need a long cord one. Unlike the clear, crispy and fully detailed sound from MDR-888SP, this one is just like you are listening to an old radio. Not even compete my crapy MDR-805. Just for the price someone might be able to suffer it, I'm not.And this pair is very uncomfortable for me. It hurts my ear after merely 15min usage. It is too big for me, even without the sponge. However, the SONY MDR-888 is so comfortable.In general, if you are not so picky for sound qualify but picky for price, it's a good choice. Otherwise, don't try it.BTW, the carrying case is so nice that I really want to keep it for my MDR-888 before returning."
5,Pleased with them.,Got this item for my girlfriend and she loves it. It sounds so much better than her Ipod earbuds and there is significantly more bass response than what she was getting before.
3,Overpriced version of the MX300..,"Overall, I'm dissapointed! I have the MX300 and they sound identical and they are like $10 less! Don't get me wrong, they are great earbuds, but I was expecting an improvement from the MX300... save yourself $10, buy the MX300 instead, the volume control doesn't change the level that much anyway."
3,"Sennheiser MX500, ouch",Nice sound. Padding on the buds is a little lacking. Hurt your ears after awhile.
3,Ow,"Maybe it's just me, but this is the second pair of earbuds I have ever owned and so far, I am 0 and 2 for comfortable earphones. The first ones I had were the iPod earphones. I was hoping these Sennheiser could replace them. Unfortunately, just like the iPod earphones, these hurt my ears after about 20 minutes or so of listening. I tried different ways of placing them in my ears, too... Softly, resting gently in my ears to pushing them in snug. And different variations on those in different positions.So, I have given up on earphones.The quality of these earphones, however, is amazing. The sound that comes out of them is fantastic. If you are someone who has larger ears or something and won't get hurt by them, you should definitely get these for their audio quality."
1,Terrible Sound,I bought this item because it was recommended to me and also because I read quite a bit of reviews. I tend to disagree with the majority as I believe that the sound of music through these earphones is really bad. I mean really bad. The old Sony set I bought has a far superior quality of sound. Do not buy this product. Waste of money.
2,You get what you pay for,"The bass is very weak. Tinny soundThe high freqs come through very strongly. I personally felt the trebles got a little irritating after a while.All-in-all, I wouldn't recommend it. My iPod buds easily out-perform."
3,You get what you pay for.....,my son asked me to get him these EarPhones to replace the ones that came with his IPod. I asked him if he would like a better (higher prices unit) but he said that he thought these would be 'good enough'.They came and when I asked him what he thought of them he said they were 'better' than the ones that came with his IPod but he was a little disappointed because he thought they would sound better. 'I guess you get what you pay for'.
2,Serves it's purpose... little bass response.,"The earphones felt a bit cheap, but the blue color was a nice touch. It felt very light too. I plugged them into my CD walkman, and played my various music, and one disappointing thing is the lack of bass. The earphones didn't perform the bass I wanted, compared to a pair of 10-15 dollar sony earphones. However.. these earphones have good treble, and good quality of sound so I'm not wholly disappointed.My opinion, buy a 10 dollar sony earphone. It sounds better than these 15 dollar ones."
4,good earphone for a good price,Good quality and good price. Very traditional design and sounds really good. I am not sure how well it compares with those expensive silicon/molded in-the-ear designs. But those cost quite a pretty penny. So these ones are very good for the price range.
3,"Triangular shape, 42"" waist","If you envision a 90 degree triangle whose base is at the top and hypotenuse runs from bottom left to top right, you get the general shape of this pack. It has a waist size of 42 measured inches. There is no retention device preventing the strap from separating at the buckle, i.e., the end of the strap is not folded over and sewn to prevent exiting the buckle.The left and right side have small pockets, running from the straps inward, about 2.5 inches. I guess these are coin inserts as I can see no other reason for these corner pockets. There is a main chamber and a medium sized chamber in front of the main chamber. A cell phone could easily fit into the front chamber."
2,Further Explain the Hedge Fund Concepts,"ALL acronyms (wordS into 1st letters) and ALL hedge fund concepts should be in the ""Glossary"" in minute detail. THERE NOT! ! ! ! This is so that the average investor can understand the hedge fund concepts and ALWAYS have a place to go to to lookup the meanings. The text can then explain IN DETAIL how the concepts are used.The text should be rewritten like a course primer. Start with basics, then build on these. Then explain how and where they are appropriately used, taking into account how to judge risk.Since hedge funds are not advaertised, how do you learn of the names & contacts of different hedge funds and their style or objectives in order to evaluate?How do I find the ""Capco's recent report"", Chapter 4, page 53?There is no detail reference! ! ! There are other references with no way to learn the details! ! ! !Since I am a market investor, I would like more information on hedge fund investing."
2,"too much critics, not enough MH","The vid clips are almost all available on ""the best of MH"" in their entirety. Here they are snipped to bits spliced in with the uninteresting comments of a handful of critics of no particular reknown. almost no interviews with the band."
1,Amazing!,"After i read it, i became more aware that things that we took for granted, are just false interpretations, like the dead officers on gulf war. Their dead are in fact just an ilussion to their family. Great tittle. But i would prefer ""This book does not exist"" or ""This book is a mistake"", ..."
5,Short and Sweet,"This book basically describes how the first Iraq war differed from traditional wars of the past. It is not for everyone, Baudrillard has the unfortunate position of being too loose with ideas to be taken very seriously by 'real' academics while at the same time writing in a style that is not easily accessible to a popular audience. His thesis is that the 'war' was primarily a media event that was useful in different ways to both sides of the conflict. He does not dispute that violence and suffering took place, but suggests that the event was not a war as was defined in the past by Clausewitz. Any review that states he is trying to 'hide' the essential suffering of those at the ground of the event is just wrong. There is nothing in the book that questions or calls into doubt the experiences of soldiers or civilians; at the same time it does not dwell upon them."
4,"Pac-Man, Ford, and the Girl Next Door","Served as my intro to Baudrillard's work and a brilliant entrance at that.Insightful as always, cutting, pulling no punches as he presents the interface for what it is.Some of the poetry is lost going from French to English, but in the absense of the one pick up the other."
5,Enter this labyrinth if you dare,"The way in is through a looking-glass that is also a vampire-haunted castle and at the sa e time a city that is all cities. Be forewarned that once you have entered the Zone, you will never completely leave it. You will find yourself in its shadowed galleries, its furtive plazas, its unpredictable elevators, from time to time for the rest of your life. You will ask questions that will never be answered (what was inside the doll?) and you will be haunted by a realization that important things are always happening just outside your understanding. Cortazar invented the interactive book in Hopscotch, another highly disturbing expedition into parallel reality, but 62: A Model Kit is his masterpiece. Here is a writer admired by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Pablo Neruda and Carlos Fuentes (who once wrote, ""Anyone who does not read Cortazar is doomed"") but has been deeply neglected in North America. Other writers talk about alternative realities; Cortazar opens the door."
3,Gimmicky at Best!,"This book builds to less then nothing (for nothing can sometimes actually be exciting). Cortazar is impressive, no doubt, but his stuff is at its core is just gimmicks and mindtricks. No real substance. He writes like someone merely trying to impress his peers in his creative writing class, and maybe get laid by that cute girl in the corner. To say he influenced writers like Marquez elevates him too much. Marquez likely saw what Cortazar lacked and built on it from there. Fun to read like it's fun watching a magician, but that's as far as it goes."
5,This one is a Must Have!,"This is by far my favorite Bobby Darin CD that I own and is one that I play over and over. The intial reason I bought it was for his amazing version of ""Fly Me to the Moon"". He took a swingin', up tempo tune and created a heart stopping, beautiful love ballad that will have you closing your eyes, imagining young Bobby is in the room with you, crooning it for only you. Whatever ""it"" is, be it charisma, charm, or just a gorgeous voice, this amazing man had ""it"". Every song on this collection is amazing. This CD is a total must have and will make you fall in love with Bobby Darin."
5,"western mind, Eastern philosophy",An excellent presentation for the western mind to understand Eastern philosophy. The concepts can be applied to understanding the rituals and symbols of any religious discipline.
4,Excellent Over the Calf Socks,"Very long socks, don't pill or fuzz easily and the usual excellent Gold Toe quality socks."
2,Okay socks..should have stuck with cotton.,"This my first pair of 100% nylon socks. The problem I have is that my feet cannot breathe in them. My socks are wet after a full day wearing them. I guess I'll just have to stay with cotton...I've never had that problem before with cotton/polyester socks. They do stay up above my calf all day long, though."
5,Don't slouch,"I love these socks. I have to wear dress socks all day and every sock that goes half way up the calf ends up slouching for me and I end up pulling them up all the time. These do not. I may have to pull them up once or twice during the day but that is all. Also, I have large calves and they fit over my large calves. Beyond that, I have been buying these socks for years and they are durable."
1,"Entirely nylon sweaty, smelly mess","I've ordered and appreciate several other versions of Gold Toe brand over-the-calf socks, including the (sadly discontinued) Auro series, black athletic socks, and the AquaFX socks (very nice). These Metropolitan socks, however, are awful in every situation I've tried. In cool & dry dress shoes they are slippery, and too thin to provide any cushion or abrasion resistance. In heavier shoes or when walking any distance, they become a sweaty mess because nylon is non-absorbent and provides no wicking or in-shoe airflow. I've never before had problems with my feet smelling bad, but after a week of these nylon disasters, my shoes started to smell because moisture-wise these socks are as good as going barefoot. Eeew. I threw them away, disinfected my shoes, and went back to a cotton blend."
1,Avoid these socks,"Avoid these socks unless you like smelly, sweaty feet. They're 100 nylon and therefore they don't allow your feet to breath. Why did I buy them in the first place? Because I saw they were high rated and I neglected to read the details. Don't make the same mistake.The seller was excellent, they got them to me fast, and got me my refund fast as well."
2,Not my favorite,"I like over the calf socks very much but they are getting harder and harder to find. It seems that most stores don't carry them. For those who like thin socks these will work well. I had no trouble with them falling down. Unfortunately, I like a heavier weave and therefore these socks are only okay for my needs."
3,Beware the colors!,"These socks are fine, they serve their purpose. However, both the brown and navy colors are extremely dark - you might as well just get the black ones."
2,Not over-the-calf,Good quality socks but not over-the-calf unless you have very skinny legs. Kirkland men's dress socks at $10/4 pair are really over the calf.
3,Stays up but delicate,"These socks stay up. They are lightweight and breathe, making them comfortable even in the hot Southern California summers.But they are delicate -- only slightly more robust than women's nylon hose. A sharp fingernail can poke a hole or cause a run."
1,"Dress Sock Review, I'd go somewhwere else.","These socks were what they said they would be; over the calf nylon socks. Absolutley nothing more & I certainly wouldn't spend this type of money on these socks ever again, I had purchased some gold toes over the calf nearly 15 years ago that I still have but these socks aren't anywhere near the same quality. They will probably wear out next year (if they last that long)."
2,For men with small calves,I am by no means large but this was way too tight on the calves. Also it was longer than I thought it would be. The combination made them very uncomfortable and I never wear them.
2,Ordered navy --- socks look black,"These are good socks, however they are black or very, very close to black. Would not order again -- but return does not make sense."
5,Great Sock,Great fit and they stay in place all day. The material is great and lightweight. Although they have a very rich feel because they are lighter weight so they may change the way you shoe fits.
1,Tight,These socks are way too tight. I am fairly certain that by around 10:30 am I have lost all circulation in my legs.
4,Good men's socks!,"These are the best men's socks ever. Price on Amazon was not outstanding, but the service and delivery make it a good deal."
2,Changed for the worse,"I have purchased these metropolitan over the calf socks for years. This last order from Gold Toe resulted in socks that seem thinner, which to me is not good. Too much trouble to return, so I am keeping them and being unsatisfied."
5,Over the calf socks,"I have relatively thin legs, so I need over the calf socks so they don't fall down and wind up in my shoes. This is the best brand I have found that meets that criteria. They are comfortable, and last a long time.They are hard to find in stores however."
2,"Intro for the beginner, waste of time for the vet","What I had hoped to find in The Philosophical Programmer was insights into the synergies between philosophy and programming. What I got was yet another introduction to programming, albeit a quality one.A more accurate title would be Introduction To Programming By a Philosophical Author. In other words, the author has a sound philosophy for describing various aspects of programming (and making them intuitive), but offers no philosophy for a programmer to apply to her or his job.What I wanted but didn't get was a fresh perspective on what a programmer does and how she or he can apply various philosphies to make them better. For example, Descartes' method of doubt is perfectly suited to coding.I recommend this book to anyone who needs a general (and soft) introduction to programming. If your a seasoned vet, read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance."
2,A good layman's book -- CS Grads can skip it...,"If you've heard the story of UNIVAC, and know why 7+4=B, this book will be mostly review. The material is well presented and would make a good Intro to Comp Sci textbook. ""Old Pros"" may also appreciate this refresher on the fundamentals of computer language & architecture. The tiny bit of philisophy at the end of this text belies its title. I was somewhat disappointed. YMMV."
1,"Weakly written, poorly thought out...","I am hard pressed to say how damaging and dangerous parts of this book are.Suffice it to say, anyone who warns of the ethical implications and great dangers of software that sets cookies on the users machine while at the same time refering to search engines as ""browsers"" should probably be staying very far away from both philosophy and any sort of commercial programming"
5,Read this book,"I have been programming for upwards of three years, but I have never read a book such as this one. It give philosophical argument pertaining to the ins and outs of programming. Whether you are a casual computer user, a casual programmer, a philosophical person, a expert programmer, or anywhere in between, this book will defintly be worth reading. Whether it expands your skills or just opens new methods of though, it is defintly a must read on my list."
5,TERRIFIC FOR A PET BATH,"THIS WATERLESS, SPRAY ON PET SHAMPOO IS GOOD FOR GIVING YOUR CAT OR DOG A QUICK CLEANING WITHOUT THE STRESS OF EXPOSING THEM TO WATER. ITALSO DEODORIZES THE FUR AND IS WELL TOLERATED BY THE ANIMAL.I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY, AND WOULD NOT BE WITHOUT IT."
2,Firelie... CAUTION!,"DO NOT BUY as a backup drive. It refuses to save files over 4 gig in size as the backup utility tries to do. Useless for this. Be warned. Otherwise, a good reliable drive for file storage and transfer from device to device. The screen is good and you may even draw on it, but it would be nice if you could cut-n-paste to it. Works fine otherwise, but I just wasted the money on a drive that cannot backup my HD and I am stuck. To paraphrase Clint Eastwood: ""I give it a two, that's only because I have never seen a one before."""
1,Research?,"A very colorful story that embellishes a few facts. The inaccuracies regarding Edward Courtenay, the Earl of Devonshire are disturbing."
3,don't use this to learn QM,"Kemble's text was one of the first on quantum mechanics, coming out in the 1930s, when all this was sparkingly new. You may want to read the book if you are a historian of science, to get an understanding of how QM was understood and taught then.But if you want to learn the book's subjects for the first time, then you should use more recent texts. For one thing, these tend to be much better illustrated. Kemble's book was written at a time when diagrams were expensive to incorporate, even in black and white. Newer books offer an easier time, with graphics for major topics."
5,Absolutely the BEST SW Territorial Cuisine - AUTHENTIC!,"There is no doubt in my mind or on my tongue that this cook book has absolutely the best recipes for SW Territorial Cuisine. When you dine in Santa Fe or Taos, this is the food you eat in private homes or at the best restaurants. The meals are totally authentic. Dent takes you through time and tradition providing descriptions of ingredients and preparation methods that are sure to get your juices flowing! There isn't a better reference. I've given over a dozen of these books to people who have commented on my enchiladas and green chile. Go for it without hesitation!"
4,Great fun,"We read this one out loud (the better to hear the voice of the Pwahdigy!) and one and all had a fun time. An easy book for a 12 year old (the upper limit of the age bracket), but the laughs come easily and the action moves at a steady pace.Looking forward to getting the next book about Solomon, Prudence, the Prodigy et al..."
4,Search for the Silver Spoon,"Poor Solomon Snow works as a laundry boy, delivering people's clothes. But when he hears about the silver spoon leading to his identity, he sets on to Town. Along the way, meeting normally very rude and unwelcome people. A girl with an abnormaly large nose, a girl who cares for nothing but sweets, and a dirty boy.This is a wonderful book, an easy read, and always entertaining. You always feel for the poor Solomon Snow, always wanting to see what will happen to the poor children. You'll really enjoy this read, and i hope you'll give it a try."
5,"Jokes, stories, puns, exercises, activities and expressions","Secrets of Connecting Leadership & Learning with Humor by academician, research consultant, and technology expert Peter M.

5,5 Stars for ALL Rod Fans,"The Rod Stewart Companion is a definite must for any Rod fan. It is not your typical unauthorized biography of a legendary performer. Ed Wincensten has added an exciting twist for fans new and old alike. The book shares fan stories, small reviews and a compilation of other exciting material. It is apparent that Wincensten has gone to great lengths to research the material to provide accurate information. The book appeals to a variety of audiences, and doesn't lose the reader in complicated words. The layout combines the photos and stories in an appealing manner. It is an excellent coffee table book that will promise to stimulate conversation at any ocassion. It is a book for all dedicated fans, especially for those who would like to relate and share with others."
5,9 years of use and still looking great!,"I bought this pot on Amazon in 2003 and have been using it since. It is very sturdy and still looks almost new after all those years of use. Granted, we don't use it daily of course. Handles are still securly fit to main body unlike many previous pots we've owned. Size is decent for a family of 4-5 people.Highly recommend!"
5,A Must See For Grinch Lovers,"If you've seen The Grinch That Stole Christmas, or It's Grinch Night, you know that the Grinch was one of Dr. Seuss's greatest creations. In this movie, the Grinch completely lives up to the viewer's expectations. I've only had the pleasure of seeing this classic, and It's Grinch Night, a few times, and I'm very disappointed that I haven't seen it in so long. It's basically about The Cat In The Hat and The Grinch almost having a battle with each other, to see who is the more audacious. I said it in the title, and I'll say it again, this is A MUST SEE FOR GRINCH LOVERS."
5,Cat in the Hat fans will love this one,Brilliant Cat in the Hat stuff. If your child loves Cat in Hat then this video is a must
3,"Really, Dr. Seuss wanted to entertain kids, not adults or teens.","I know that some adults and teens really like the cartoons, but for me, not really. My 16 sister, Pamela (who is autistic) loves the cartoons on DVD, but I do rather not want to watch them with her (unless she forces me to). Well, since Hollywood has deranged Dr. Seuss's books, these series are the only choices for the time being. If I had a choice inwhich I would pick the Hollywood series (Cat in the Hat, Grinch) and the cartoons, I would pick the cartoons. If you have a kid who loves Seuss, then you should buy it, but parents, be warned: the cute characters sing like they had enough to drink! If you can, listen to your iPod unless you really love Seuss toons. Still, I have to admit that the cartoon characters are cute and the words they speak are better than having the Cat in the Hat (Mike Myers) say ""Son of a [beep]!"""
1,obsolete,does not receive digital tv sold in discount stores new for less than $20converters transmit a buzz when connectedi had 3 all did the sameradio works
3,slow shippping,TV is ok but it took 15 days to arrive after the order and it was shipped UPS. To take that long to come from Flordia to upstate N.Y. is excessive and it wasn't UPS fault.
1,Roll of Thunder,I think this movie was not even close to the book. The way they started the movie was more like the middle of the book. There were many obvious differences between the two. Like in the book there were Wallaces and Simms and in the movie there were only Wallaces. If you haven't read the book and you watch the movie it would confuse you. The acting in the movie was really bad besides Morgan Freeman.
2,Doesn't Come Close to the Book,"Most movies based on books do not deliver the power that the books do, but the film version of Roll of Thunder does an even worse job that usually is done. It would be hard to replicate the experience of that wonderful story, but this movie does so little for the viewer that it is not worth the time to watch. It is slow and drags on and on."
1,Don't Judge a Book by the Movie,The Movie is totally confusing. It leaves out important scenes that are relevant to movie. I jumps around. The casting is all wrong. Cassie looks 15 instead of 9. She's much bigger than Stacey who is 12-13! I've shown this movie to my students over 10 years and none of them like it at all. They actually get angry while watching because they know scenes are not correct. It is a good lesson in compare/contrast and how a book can be so much better than the movie.
2,This was not a good movie.,"This movie lacked the chronological order that the book had. The movie started with what the book had right in the center. It started with Papa breaking his leg, and the book has Papa breaking his leg in the middle or close to the end of the book. Uncle Hammer doesn't have a Packard, he has some older car and it wasn't silver like the book said. Mama loses her job at the school in the beginning of the movie and miraculously has it back at the end of the movie. This movie also lacked the characters the Simms. Lillian Jean was Mr. Wallace's kid, and Jeremy didn't appear more than twice in the whole movie."
3,"Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry","Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry, is a strong, powerful, and a very interesting book. It tells of how an African American family strugles to live in the threat of racism in the 1930's. Cassie, the girl who narrates the story, has to learn to stand up for herself but must be careful at the same time. I enjoyied this book somewhat. I didn't think it had much action to it but thought it had a twist to most of the interesting parts. The most surprising part to me was when the store keeper got killed. I think this because you would never guess who was in the store at the same time with the murderers witnessing it. One of my dislikes was the predjeduice people who were against African Americans. I found that the white people were very cold hearted."
1,antisocail,"This movie really stunk the acting was horrible except Morgan Freeman.Every copy should be shoved down his throat.They needed a higher budget it looked like it cost six cents to make.Did I mention how much i hate this movie. This is the worst movie i have ever seen and i've saw some pretty bad movies. they should have better actors.during the scene where papa cacthes the cotton on fire Jermey,Cassy, Stacey, Little man. they looked like they were reading the script."
1,What a Disappointment,"I bought this video to show to my students as a culminating activity of their novel study. Even though other reviews warned that the video ""skipped around"", I thought I could ask my students to do a critical analysis of the differences between the video and the novel. However, the appallingly poor editing of this movie not only makes that impossible, but makes the story virtually unintelligible to anyone who hasn't read the novel first. For example, Mrs. Logan has lost her teaching position early in the movie, but inexplicably has it back mid-way through. Cassie's revenge on Lillian Jean is limited to watching her obsequiously offer to carry Lillian Jean's books. No explanation of why she's suddenly carrying the books, or of how her planned revenge works out. (I wanted to see Cassie beat her up!!)"
1,My review,The movie wasn't as good as the book.The movie was very bad at acting.I wouldn't recommend this movie for kids that read the book because it don't follow book.The Wallaces and the Simms where all mixed up.If you watch the movie you should not read the book.You shouldn't buy the movie you should buy the book.So that is why you should not watch the movie befor the book.
1,That was the worst movie I ever saw,"This movie was horibble. All the scenes were out of proportion. I was so disappointed. After our class had read the book, we were all pretty satisfied with it. So we decied to watch the movie. It started out with the movie starting in the middle of the book. Some of the parts were left out of the movie. I just have a little note for the director; read the book and make the movie right. And to the author: why would you let them make a movie of the book? The book is already great without the movie. I think this movie is the worst movie ever; they missed out on the beating up on T.J and when Cassie beats up Lillian Jean."
1,The movie was Whack,"I feel that this movie was not so good. I like some parts like when Uncle Hammer came to thier house. He had a nice car. I didn't like how he sold his car. However, Uncle Hammer had to sell his car in order to make payment on the land. I also liked when Cassie pulled Lillian Jean's hair. The parts I didn't like was how the charachters didn't look like they were suppose to. Another reason I didn't like the movie was because it skippd alot of parts and it stopped too much. I wish the director would have showed more completed scenes. If I was to rate this movie, I would give it a one (1)."
3,Read this instead of the other reviews!,"Ok, I agree that this movie was not one of the best movies, but the main reason most people hate it was because of it's strange order (different from the book)Well......When this movie first came out on TV, it had EVERYTHING! The whole book, I mean it was 4 hours long! They cut it down and heavily edited it later, making it a far worse movie. Still, I think if people saw the unedited version, it might be better, it might not, but please stop bashing about how this movie is soooooo bad because of its order, when in real life, it had the WHOLE BOOK fit into it before the edits!"
1,This movie bites the big one,easily one of the worst movies i have EVER seen. They played things that happened at the end of the book in the beginning of the movie. it was hard to see. Cassie is supposed to be a third grader and she's taller then Stacey(13). this movie had so many problems i hated it! :( don't bother watching this movie! Mr.Lock if u ever read this you shouldn't have made us finish watching it :P it was a waste of class time and we should have just stuck to the book.
1,How Disappointing :-(,"My fourth-grader and I read this wonderful book together and I hyped her on watching this movie, which came out when I was in the fourth grade in the seventies. How disappointing! What a rip-off! This video takes edited scenes as a montage at the beginning and then starts in the middle of the story. Entire scenes critical to character development and plot are lost--the beautiful relationship between the siblings, Stacie's relationship to TJ, how the Logans got their land and why they were so different than the other sharecropping families, the role of Mama and Big Ma in keeping the family together, etc. You'd be lost watching this movie if you hadn't read the book. My daughter and I were eagerly awaiting the scene when Cassie gets her revenge on Lillian Jean, which is shown only as a ending montage of scenes. How unfortunate--with DVDs out now, there's no reason for this movie not to be available in its entirety. I should have heeded the warnings of the other Amazon reviewers!"
2,Not What I Hoped It Would Be,"I wish I could get ahold of the original uncut version of this. In the editing process, events have been placed in the wrong order and much of the emotionalism we should feel has been eliminated. My students are very disappointed in the film adaptation. It does not do the book justice at all. Is there any way to find the original?"
3,Review of Roll of Thunder,"The video story had a good concept, a good plot showing events that were very realistic, but it left out key events such as the revenge of Cassie against Lilian Jean, how the blacks were treated in school, and the revenge of the Logan children getting back at the white bus driver. Watching the movie with important events left out, left the audience confused."
1,I wish I could put 0 stars,I hate this movie. It was wack. I wish the actors didn't get paid. I thought the lighting was horrible. You can't even see the people. It was like a horror movie like this. In the scene where Cassie gets back at (Miss) Lilian Jean she only pulls her hair. Also the guy who played Mr. Morrison isn't 7 foot tall he looks like a leprechaun compared to how they describe him in the book. Ithink Mildred D. Taylor should not have let them make the movie after she saw it. If they remake it I hope its way better!!!!!!!!!!
1,Adult Reader and Viewer,"I saw the original version of this movie. I thought it was pretty good. This edited version made this movie frustrating to watch if you read the book first. The original version followed the sequence of the book. Like any movie adapted from a novel, not everything was included, but it was good. This version is horrible. Even the box says it has 115 minutes running time. But thats not true. I don't think anyone should buy this version. The flaws in the editing are just to horrendous. I hope that a DVD will be produced to enclude the original version because the story is excellent."
1,I Rather Roll Over and Die,"The movie is horrible. The movie takes moments from the book and puts them out of order. Events that happended at the beginning of the book were put at the ending in the movie. The movie also leaves out important details from the book that should have been used to describe events in the movie. Without those details the event makes no sense what-so-ever to someone who has not read the book. In summary, read the book and forget the movie."
1,Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry,"This movie is so out of sequence. The movie starts out in the middle. You didn't even get to see Cassie beat down Lillan Jean. The book was way better. I liked the book, but the movie was so stupid. Mr. Morrison wasn't even burnt. The Simms and the Wallaces were like the same faimly. There was no point in making this movie if it was so out of sequence. You would have to read the book even to understand the movie. I hope people read the book before the movie."
1,rating of roll of thunder movie,"The movie Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry in my opinion was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The movie was very difficult to follow and without reading the book first there would be no way you could understand the movie. The movie skipped around and did not go in order. The movie also did not have all the same characters as the book and the descriptions in the book did not fit the descriptions in the movie. In conclusion, I do not think anyone, no matter what the circumstances, should watch the movie. It is bad!"
1,The Movie Inhaled Vigorously,"The movie was a HUGE disappointment from the book. It skipped around and started at the end; it was very hard to follow. If you hadn't read the book I don't think you would have understood the movie at all. It was a class project to read the book and we then watched the movie--it was a waste of time. I would never watch that movie again; they made Big Ma sound like she was dieing when she sang, it was terrible. My advice...don't watch the movie!!"
2,not as good,"I think that this movie did not live u[ to the book not because of he actors or the scenery it was because of the skiping around that it did, showing parts of the ending at the begining also the actors were not so life like please redo the movie as the book (in oder) or you will not get one cent out of me agin if this movie dose not go as well as it should."
1,"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry","Beware!The book by Mildred D. Taylor is powerful and riveting. I have used this book in my classroom and the children have loved it. The chance to use the video to enhance the book motivated me to buy it. Imagine my surprise when the video proved to be edited sloppily. The video jumps from one scene to another out of order. I believe the video, if in correct order, would be worthwhile. Morgan Freeman is always worth watching, and the rest of the cast is excellent also. This was a deep disappointment to me.Since I was foolish enough to throw away the packaging, I cannot return it. If you purchase this video, save everything and check it out immediately. Now I will be forced to choose scenes to view in class, as watching the entire video would only be confusing to my class."
1,This movie was poorly created.,The movie did not follow the author's written version. The events were out of sequence. The characters were poorly portrayed. Some of the characters were omitted. The story was not fully developed as in the well written and phenomenal novel.
4,THERE GO THE WARM JETS!!!,"I bought this album for 50 cents on Amazon.com & I really like it! I think you may,too. I was reading a lukewarm review of them in an old Select. Although the reviewer was kinda trashing it, it sounded like something I'd like, & sure enough.....very, very good! It's in the Super Blurry Bowie realm. Nice chord changes, lotsa hooks, and gets better with every listen. Like the guy up there said; It won't blow you away, but you may find yourself putting it on again and again."
3,not compatibile w/audiovox,Don't buy this for the Audiovox MP1000...it doesn't work! It is listed as being compatibile but it's not. Hopefully Audiovox will replenish the supply of memory that it compatibile.
1,Not Compatable at all with Jam MP3,"Not real familar with multimedia cards, I read & read. Viking stated it was compatable with Jam MP3 player and several other MP3 players. I ordered the Viking Multimedia Card 16MB. My son has tried and tried to get his songs to download on this card, in fact he has used up several batteries trying to do so. I feel this is not a good MMC for MP3 players. The manufacture suggested only Sandisk, I think it's wise to use the manufacture's suggestions regardless of what others might say. I'm really disappointed that I have spent my time & money on a card that obviously was misrepresented."
2,"Good price, but Strange Fit","I wanted to try the modern classic fit and I assumed the sizing would be the same as with the contemporary fit, but it is not. A size 12 contemporary fit is the perfect size for me, but with the modern classic, the top was baggy around the arms and the shoulder straps were too long. I returned the suit and bought a comparable Nike suit at a local store- they fit me much better."
4,"great suit, but does run a bit smaller than traditional speedo ultraback","Great suit, but if you're a 10, order a 12 because this suit is about one size smaller than the traditional ultraback."
1,abusive situation,"Some people may not agree with this review, but I found the constant fight and fist fights with the triplets abusive and tiresome. I just found that kind of story line very offensive, especially with all of the abuse that goes on in this world."
2,"Silly, simple, boring","I'm glad I didn't buy this book and only checked it out at the library. It has okay characters but such a SIMPLE, SILLY plot."
4,I like Mike Massey - this is good,"It's sort of cheap. Easy to assemble, but very functional. Surprise was the number and quality of accessories - we got a lot for our money. And the drink holders. How many times have I played pool in a pool hall or anywhere and needed those. So it could be better and of higher quality, better wood, etc. - but that's my only criticism."
5,Cue rack,"Price point was excellent, arrived in a couple of days, easy to assemble, works as planned, no issues at all!"
3,Functional but not the Best,"Fulfilled by Amazon so I received this quickly. It was a snap to put together. Overall, the wood quality is good. There are little felt liners that go in each hole to protect the cue stick. Some of these fell off right away. I don't have really expensive cues so it's not a big deal to me. But beware, the rough wood is exposed on some of the holes."
1,Nothing like picture,"Very disappointed with this purchase nothing like the display picture,color is to pail and nothing looks like what i saw on the picture of product hope all my other orders come out looking better"
4,Good value for the money,"Looking for a functional, stable, and inexpensive cue rack for the rec room? This is it. Just what I was looking for. Assembles in about a minute with no tools needed."
1,massey billiards corner cue rack,When I got this item they had put two bottom boards in the box so there were no holes for the cues it has set on my table now for a month because it will be no telling when they can send me a replacement rack instead of just sending me the top board that needs to be replaced
2,pool accessory holder,"The quality was not quite what I had expected. It is made to look like it is wood, but it appears to be plywood with wood paper covering and some of the parts are plastic. Would not recommend it."
4,Nothing Spectacular - Does the job...,"I went in search for a fairly cheap cue rack and liked the idea of these corner ones over a wall mount. The price is right and after it arrived, it assembled in 2 minutes. It's sturdy and does exactly what you'd exect - hold cue sticks. The only complaint is that the top ""shelf"" is a little too low to comfortably place drinks."
1,don't buy it,"this product is horrible. First I had to wait about a month to recieve this item and when i did, it was messed up, the wood was peeling off the top piece, one of the peices wouldn't screw on becasue it was too short and it looks nothing like the picture. it looks cheap and discusting. Don't buy it just spend ten more bucks and get something better."
5,Best Album Ever!,"They Might Be Giants have never sounded better! At first I thought that a white band would not be able to tackle the beautiful blackness of Richard Pryor, but they did, and brilliantly!"
4,"Looks Great, Couple of Funnies","This set looks very handsome indeed in our new kitchen. The action is extremely smooth and the size is just right to match our deep sinks.Two negatives - a minor one first - there isn't a dishwasher relief to match. The bigger one, still not a really major thing, is that the sprayer hose is not weighted, and no weight kit is offered. As a result, using the sprayer and getting it back in place is much more a nuisance than this fine set deserves. The jumble of hoses and pipes under the sink tends to keep the sprayer hose from retracting as easily as it could if it were weighted. The kitchen installers asked the question - ""Where's the weights?"" when they opened the box."
2,6 Years of problems,"Be careful, the brushed nickel stains easily. If you have some type of cleansers on your hands you can permanently stain it easily. I would never buy this again, only chrome.Within a year the sprayer became so weak it was nearly useless.At 5 years we had to replace the main valve and now a year later the diverter valve for the sprayer needs changed. Plumbers? Get out your check book.This house was plumbed 100% with Kohler. It is 15 years old. at 10 years old we had replaced 6 Kohler faucet sets from bad pitting on surfaces. Now we have a leaking Kohler shower valve. Needless to say we have not replaced anything with Kohler and let the company know it.Bad valve? They will send the original owner a replacement-- for the $16 valve a plumber will charge $100 to replace. Thanks, Kohler. Shower valve? $200.I recommend you check other brands. I think the Forte design gave up quality for appearence.Fool me once..."
5,This is TIESTO!!![.],"I have and have listened to all of DJ Tiesto albums. He is 1 of the best DJ around nowadays and his new album NYANA, is his best since Magik 7.This is a compliation of tunes, but modified to be purely trance- DJ Tiesto style. You won;t regret buying this album!!![.]"
2,Interesting starts but where do they go?,I found the music too redundant and processed to keep my attention during his last set that I heard and on this CD. It is simple to make many tracks but to keep the attention of the dancers and the audience is the artform that I look for in the tracks I buy.
2,RUBBISH from a master,Considering the brilliance of the Magik and In Search of Sunrise series how could Tiesto put this out. I bought it because of the brilliance of his other work. This double CD was a wasted purchase and equates to material that is expelled from the end of the gastrointestinal tract.
4,Great Stuff,I can't believe I haven't made a review about this in the past but I'm back now!This is a solid 2 disc album.First disc is great but starts up slow which for me I really didn't care.Second disc is for vocal fans if you hate music with vocals burn this disc down! But I really enjoyed this disc. It has the legendary song Beautiful Things.Overall get this cause trance is changing now a days and this one is a solid album. For those that love trance will like the EVERYTHING about this album.4.0 out of 5.0
4,listen to johnfsu,"Yes, this album wasnt the best but it did have some standout tracks. I believe this album can be summed up with what johnfsu said. It definitely isnt his best cd. Its a good one with the second disc being the favorite of mine, but it doesnt have the sheer strength of magik 6 and the beautiful feeling of isos 3. I would give him a three stars, but the greatness of his mixing gives it the fourth star. Being a faithful fan, i did enjoy the cd. But i still think Armin van Buuren has more talent"
4,Good but not great,"I am a big fan of DJ Tiesto, but this was not one of his best works. Tracks that I really enjoy are Venus w Jan Johnston, Tears from the Moon w Snead O'Connor, Beautiful Things on Disc 2 and Never w Tina Arena on Disc 2. I always have enjoyed the upbeat tempo and feel of Tiesto CD's, but the groove gets lost in parts, and only a handful of the tracks are ""danceable"". With most sets that Tiesto has released, one can get swept up in the music and tempos, but that just didn't really happen here. It is however a good set to just sit back and relax. Some good vocal pieces and some good tempos, but Tiesto has done better. I was particularly annoyed by Electronic Malfunction. This tune just doesn't seem like his style and completely out of place in the set. So I would give Tiesto 3.5 to 4 stars on this one."
5,Buy me.,"If you like Tiesto, simply put, you will love this cd. Trance doesn't get any better than Tiesto, and Nyana is his greatest representation."
3,OVER rated!!!,"Listening to this CD, it seems like Tiesto was doing a little experimenting and voila... crap was created! Okay, maybe not that extreme, but for what you're paying for, it's definately not worth the money. It's one of those CD's where there are 2/3 good songs on the disc and the rest you spend your time skipping through the other tunes to get to the next good song of the 3. Aside for that, Tiesto's mixing is superb on this CD!!! To give you a little taste on which songs I thought were good, they included: as the rush comes, beautiful things, and nyana..."
3,"Some Great tracks, some horrible ones.","This CD is difficult to listen to and when i first bought it was highly disappointed. After a while i realized about half of each cd is fantastic, Nyana should have been one disc with the best of the two on it. Tiesto is a great DJ and has some amazing trance cd's, but if you're looking for some real tiesto, get Magik or In search of sunrise, avoid this one if you're a newbie. Some tracks are just too repetitive for anyone's tastes, even on the dancefloor..."
3,Losing it,"It seems like I'm the only one that thinks of this CD as mediocre. It seems to me that Tiesto is starting to lose his love for music, and is more concerned with playing ""hot, new tracks"". Ever since Magik 5, I have percieved Tiestos passion for his music head down the proverbial tube. His DJ skills remain the same, decent, but not spectacular. Basically, other than ""fresh"" new tracks, Tiesto has nothing left to offer me. Sorry Tijs...you're going downhill fast."
4,Good Tiesto as Always ....,"I must to say Tiesto is one of the must outstanding DJs in the world, I have seen his performance live and the guy is the DJ that talks to you with his music. This CD is a sample of his parties. I recomend the CD as I did for myself is trance, house, and Euro-trance.Go ahead and let take you by the music.The outstanding DJ from Netherlands: Tiesto is one of the bests the number 2 of the world for me.Nyana: 4 stars bright :)"
2,Fallen Star,"I cant say that I don't regret buying the cd. This mix does have some rather good tracks such as "" Let the light shine in (Darren Tate's one hit wonder) or Holden - nothing (93 return etc.) This is the mix of a fallen star (Dj Tiesto aka Dj Tiesticles ) back when I was about 15 or so the name Tiesto meant something. It stood for an individual who dedicated his life to the sound of the underground . Tiesto had magic by all means. Little by little he began selling out, playing worthless songs in the top ten list, trying to please the majority of the club goers around the globe.... it's a shame he's in the number one slot. I've seen talent that smokes tiesto away (ex James Zabiela)So if you want a retrospect of top club hits from 2003, I would recommend this cd. Its tolerable but the mixing is borderline average"
5,God Of the Netherlands,Tiesto is like the king of trance techno and anything that might be considered as electronic music!!!!i love you man
4,"Sex, Lies and Litigation",A great easy read. The characters are fun and believable. This is such a real life novel that you could almost place yourself in the situations the characters find themselves in. A fun book.
3,Funny but...,"Hard to read. I did finish the entire book but it took about a week, which for me is for ever. Most books I finish in a day. I'm not sure why I had such a hard time with this one. I don't think the writing style is my style."
2,Not worth it,"Has some very funny settings and ideas, but it lacks continuity, several paragraphs have to be reread in order to understand what the author meant. Seems as though she goes back from first to third person in the story so is hard to follow, a good plot badly writen, lacks style."
1,Boring,"Utterly boring,the story just didn't get going. I skipped a dozen pages & then just stopped reading it all together. Deffenitly not a gripping read."
2,A Very Bad Trend,"If you look at the reviews for the bundled art history software by CounterTop, you will see multiple mentions of software problems. One can only use 2 of the 5 bundled CDs. It's a shame because you can see where the software creators were headed but one cannot get the programs to run correctly. It's almost as if CounterTop doesn't care; they just bundle old software together and provide no support for known problems at their website."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"You will get about $20 worth of use from this product. What you can bring up from the software is entertaining and interesting. However you will not get 1/100th of what you think is promised by the packaging and titles. The software is often difficult and unattractive. The musical examples are limited and not well recorded. The Musical Dictonary gives you precise definitions but not any great commentary. If you expect a great bargain, you will be unhappy. CounterTop is the software equivalent of the Dollar Store. You get what you pay for."
2,"Well, it was cheap","The CD set has a wealth of information- but the media itself (how it loads, how the program plays, how you access info) is dated and VERY basic. It was also a bit surprizing that it takes a bit of doing to ever hear the music. Very ""reference text"" feeling.If you are looking for a way to READ more about music, this is a fine set. If you are looking for an interactive experience, keep looking."
5,Outstanding Overview of Classical Music,"This fascinating title explores nearly every facet of classical music, featuring over 11,000 entries, 200 photographs, 500 music clips, and information on 3,000 operas and 4,000 personalities. The titles include ""Live With Chopin"", ""The Hutchinson Encyclopedia of Music"", ""Vivaldi, The Four Seasons"", ""Classical Orchestra Notes"", and ""Mozart, Prince of Harmony"". Multimedia presentation includes performances as well as analysis and background material."
3,good gate - inadequate hardware included,"Overall the gate is well designed and functional, but it really irks me that they cannot seem to send long enough screws to mount this thing. It wouldn't be that hard to do.I like complete packages, and wouldn't feel good giving 4-5 stars until they correct this issue. Most folks, I imagine, will want to mount through drywall or plaster into a stud. Further, I think most would want the security that comes with a longer mounting screw."
4,Quick and easy,Received fast and in good condition. Installation was quick and easy. The auto latching works well and it appears that the construction is plenty strong enough for its application.
2,dvd ROM!!,"I got a copy of a dvd, not even the real dvd, no menu, no fast forward chapters. It's essentially a bootleg which is illegal to sell and I will be contacting amazon about this. The movie however is a great film. Find it somewhere else."
1,Kindle version is poor,"The kindle version is just awful. The pictures are too small and fuzzy to see properly, the definition is poor, sometimes the words are on the wrong page, and incidental dialogue within the picture frames is unreadable (and not written out below). The story may be sweet, but this Kindle version is sub-standard, and not worth the money."
1,Will not work with IPAQ,"I bought this modem at CompUSA for ..., took it home and hurriedly unpackaged it and slipped it into the unwieldy IPAQ sleeve and was ready to go. Then I got an ""unrecognized CF card"" error. I tried again. No dice. I did a soft reboot. No luck. I took it back to the store and tried another one out of the box. No luck. I took my IPAQ back to the other retailer (BB) and tried another CF sleeve. Then another IPAQ unit. Still no go. I called Tech Support for both Compaq and the manufacturer. Compaq made me do a hard reset (in which I lost everything)."
1,Don't Buy This Thing,"The company that makes this item went of business March, 2001. This makes the ""5 year warranty"" useless. I bought one in August 2001 and quit functioning February 2002. If I had known the company was out of business, I wouldn't have purchased it."
3,So-so,Tastes good but did nothing for my BP. Certainly not worth the price though as it isn't all that great tasting.
3,Tea,Doubt if it helps tea itself is good tasting. Take other remedies also. I have nothing more to say so just typing enough words. Don't like to do reviews
5,A Great Set,"We bought this set to have at Grandma's house, as we have the Thomas wooden set at home. I love the GeoTrax because of the stability of the track when snapped together and the remote control option. My son has a disability and has a hard time putting the pieces of his wooden set together, as well as keeping them together since they do not snap. He has no problems with the GeoTrax despite crawling all over it! The pieces stay together with no problems. I wish his Thomas set could say the same! If it weren't for the amazing characters from Thomas and Friends, I would prefer the GeoTrax, especially for the price! All in all, though, this is a great set that I would (and have already) recommend to others."
2,This is the least durable fisher price toy I have ever seen,"We have purchased four different trains, and many accesories over the last several years. Every train in the geotrax line that we have purchased has stopped working. I have sent trains back at least four times. The last one was given to him at Christmas and it stopped working before the end of Jan. My son loves this toy, and he hasn't thrown them or beaten up on them or done anything to cause this. The trains usually stop working after being stored( without batteries) from 1 week to 2 months.My son is really frustrated, because every time he tries to play, something doesnt work. At this point only 1 train works, and the last train, which I sent in to be fixed because they didnt have any to replace- they never sent back. Its been 8 months."
4,Geotrax Trains,"It is a Christmas gift so he has not opened it yet, but he played with the exact set at my aunt's house. For a child who rarely sits still, this set kept his attention and we had to physically remove him from it when it was time to leave. He played with it nonstop for about 2 hours. I am hoping he loves his own just as much."
4,Christmas Hit,My 3 year old got this product as a Christmas present. It may have been our favorite toy. Everyone in the house spent time playing with it. It is easy to assemble without looking at the instructions. It takes only minutes to get up and running. Looks like it is made to last. Only negitive is that some of the track layouts don't really work.They might if you bought more track but it is not a big deal.
5,Wish I had this when I was a child!,"We bought this as our starter set and have grown to great room size proportions due to the great quality, exciting fun, and interactive play this delivers.I almost never knew what I was missing as this set came with a train that had bad gears and would not work. My son enjoyed pushing it and I complained about the quality. I bit my tongue and opted to purchase a second engine and to my amazement this thing is simply awesome! I highly recommend!"
5,A Fun Train For Young Children,"My son received this train set for Christmas, and it has quickly become one of his favorite toys. The assembly is quick and easy, and there are several fun stops that the train makes on its way around the track, including a windmill and factory. The train itself makes different train noises by using the remote control. A bonus train and watertower were also included in the set.One drawback to this set is the number of batteries required. The train and remote each take three AAA batteries, so battery replacement could become somewhat costly.I recommend this great set very highly. This is the perfect first train set for children. The biggest plus is the quick assembly. Your child won't have to wait for hours while the set is being put together; they will be playing with this set within twenty minutes. Purchase this fun train and introduce your own little engineer to the fun of railroading. All aboard!"
4,Great toy for my 2 1/2 year old grandaughter,Great toy for my 2 1/2 year old grandaughter. She took to it right away. I was her favorite Christmas gift.
5,Another Blood & Fire winner!,2 lp's on 1 cd. The 1st is the great In The Light vocal album. The 2nd is the stupid-rare dub version. The dubs by Prince Jammy are worth way more than the price of this set alone.Another fantastic value from one of the best reissue labels out there.Quit reading and start buying.
2,Disappointing,"I'm surprised that there are so many good reviews of this, because I thought it was a disappointment. The synopsis sounded good, but it turned out hokey and dry. The setting is Louisiana, and Jessica is a woman who can heal people by touching them. She has a brother locked up in a sanitarium, tormented by a force he doesn't understand. Turns out it's a demonic entity who's also torturing some bayou dweller named Eli, who has the same healing powers as Jessica. Jessica has a son, and of course that somewhat ruins the whole thing, as kids tend to do, and in the end there's lots of bloodletting and nonsense. It just didn't hold my attention at all."
3,"Great setting, mediocre everything else",I loved the cajun bayou setting. More horror novels should be set in this area. The story itself just didn't do it for me. There were parts that got too slow and uninteresting for me to follow. Very up and down novel in terms of keeping my interest.
5,Family Inheritance- Definite Keeper,"If you like horror and suspense, you've got to check this book out. It is quite an amazing first novel. Set in the bayous of Louisania, this thriller really lets you into another world and sinks you deep into the cajun mystique. It has all kinds of twists and turns. This really is a page turner. If you are a thriller/horror fan, I think you will really like this one."
5,cajun thriller,"I really enjoyed this book. I am a great fan of most books that take place in Louisiana. Grabbed my attention from the first page, and was good until the end. I can't wait to start the next one."
5,These rival my Sony Studio Monitor headphones,"I cannot beleive the quality of sound from these headphones. Not to mention the price! These headphones sound every bit as good as my *very expensive* Sony Studio Monitor headphones at a fraction of the price.They have a very rich, well-balanced sound and can handle very high power and punch with no distortion.I am very, *very* picky about my headphones. They had better be rich and perfectly clean for me to even consider them... and these more than meet my expectations.And to beleive I get this from a headphone brand I've never heard of, and at a price like this!I highly recommend these headphones."
5,Too far ahead for here,"The Swamp Rats - man they were good. They were too far ahead for the Burgh though. The guys could really rock - live they were indredible. It's too bad that there was no punk or raw scene here in those days. Too bad too, that Terry Lee (their manager)didn't let the guys do original stuff. TL was an immensely popular DJ at the time who had what was called The TL Sound and on his shows he exposed listeners to a lot of good stuff - including the beginnings of Punk - he was the only one in the area to give the Seeds any airplay - and the Rats were similar to the Seeds - punk, but good punk with real players and good vocals (Bobby Hocko). This album is absolutely worth buying - if you grew up in the Pittsburgh area and went to any of the local TL dances that the Rats played, it will take you back. There were a lot of other good bands from the area, but The Swamp rats were by far way ahead of the pack. Buy this album - you'll be glad you did!"
4,Creeper too,"Great final plot. Great read. However, too much in-depth detail about the fashion industry, which is interesting but too detailed. It takes awhile to really pick up, but stick with it---exciting story climax."
3,Not the Best,"I've read every book written by those two dynamic women and I'm waiting patiently for their new release in January...pre-ordered all ready. But this once was a little slow, predictable, and a bit of a let down in the end. But I haven't given up on them...they're still one of my favorite writing teams."
4,Creeper,The book starts off very slow-but stay with it. The story creeps up on you and then explodes. I can't give a full review because I left the book on an airplane. I was up to the 9th chapter. I would love to know how it all turned out. (very interesting story) It's worth the purchase!
4,Well done,"I have also read 'The Earth is Not Moving', but this is put together in a more concise and readable volume. The Holy Christian Bible does constitute most of the argument for a geocentric theory, but also scientific and common sense arguments are used. Will at least get you thinking, if not convinced, and isn't that why we read?"
3,Nice Scope - There are better.,"I bought this scope initially and placed on my 308 Scout Rifle thinking that 6"" was enough eye relief; however it was not enough. This is not a good Scout Rifle Scope and will not have enough eye relief for a forward mounted rail placement.Pros:- Good Value for Cost- Solid Construction- Adjustment knobs easy to useCons:- Had problems zeroing the scope- Elevation and Windage did not seem to move POII ended up sending mine back to Amazon for a refund. Maybe I just ended up with a defective Scope. (Former US Army)"
4,Nice scope..no mounts included tho,"Very nice scope,i've always loved Bushnell products...only downfall,there was no mounting rings included with it,kinda sucks to pay that much money for a scope and no rings included."
4,Good for the Money,"I have nothing bad to say about this scope. If you are the type that wants to spend hundreds on a scope then don't get this one. I think it was a great value and I was not about to spend hundreds on a scope for a $120 rifle. Fits prefectly on a Mosin Nagant M91/30. You must get a good scope mount. I could not find a ""good"" one at Amazon, but was able to order from a Brownells catalog.Bottom line, min 6"" eye relief is REQUIRED for the Mosin Nagant, this is a great scope for that rifle. Was able to shoot 1/2"" groups @ 100 yards."
4,Decent,"I bought this scope originally for my Mosin Nagant. But after i received it i clearly needed more eye relief. I loved the product, very well made, but i did have to return it.."
5,Writing the Great American Romance Novel,"This book was amazing. Catherine Lanigan has written some of the most beautiful Romances books. Becoming, and Romancing the Stone just a few examples.Now she tells you how you can do the same. I first bought this book for help with a romance I am trying to write and her advice on Query letters and inspiring In Spriritu chapter at the end of the book gave me the confidence to keep forging ahead in my career."
2,Mega-Mag G3 Torpedo Level,A very nicely machined level with a strong magnet and several handy features such as vee grooves to accommodate checking corners and round stock. The big negative was the bubble in the vile was way to small for the allotted space between the reference marks. It was difficult to consistently center the bubble in such a large space. I returned the unit for credit.
5,A great resource for gamers,"A bunch of Expert class characters, new skills, new magic items, and other stuff that a DM will find useful--and a lot of the ideas translate over to other (non-D&D) role-playing settings. All in all, a great resource."
4,Very Useful RPG resource,I haven't really had a chance to use the book's game rules but the book provies more then enough information to flesh npcs or characters out in any game.
5,A valuable resource for any game,"An amazing book full of detailed information to enable any campaign to flush itself out with characters from all walks of life. Good for building specialize background characters to make the game run smoother, give a quest to further the plot, or even to allow Player Characters something to make them more unique this book has is all. More Feats and Skills to have players make or arrange to have made just about anything they can think of. From the simple tradesman to a citywide guild, you can create what you need for your campaign. New Items, ready made characters, DC tables to guide tasks for the Trades and Professions, as well as more than twenty five expert classes. Defiantly worth keeping in your library of books."
4,good fabric<<<,really like the shirt..fabric is pretty thick and substantial..only complaint is i wish the shirt was a little longer
1,Disappointed. It's not loose leaf. It's ground tea.,"In the past Twinings sold loose leaf tea. It's disappointing that they now ground the tea like that found in tea bags. If I wanted fannings I would have bought it already in bags. Ground tea tends to be more bitter for the same amount of steep time, in my opinion. I loved their English Breakfast and Prince of Wales teas. Considering that you get about 25 cups per 4 oz can, at best you are paying the same as getting the bags. I guess I will have to try Bigelow or some other brand for loose leaf tea."
2,"I was ""fascinated""!","When I first bought it, I thought it's a pretty good tool for school. However, I was very disappointed at this encyclopedia. It hardly have any information in it. Also, it has only a small amount of pictures, audios, etc. The other CDs that come with the main encyclopedia is not that good, too. I feel that the only thing helpful is The Hutchinson Educational Encyclopedia 2000. If I'm you, I wouldn't decide to buy it."
1,"looks great, comfortable, tore quickly","Title says it all, bought it for watching soccer games. It looks great, folds away easily, is comfortable as can be, and the fabric tore with a couple of months. very disappointing"
5,slumberjack camp chairs,"My wife and I needed better folding camp chairs since I have had multiple knee and back surgeries. These fit our needs, provide excellent support and are also very comfortable. I would recommend these to anyone looking to upgrade from the cheaper models to a better quality chair."
1,Beware of bag!,"I loved this chair first time I set in it at a store. I ordered 5 for the whole family and still love the chair I just can't get them back into the bag, bag way too small. If I had checked out the bag before ordering I would have kept shopping for something else."
3,Slumberjack Mesh Quad Chair,"Bummer! Disappointed in finding several broken areas on the chair.Happily though, I had no problem returning it for a refund."
3,Could be better,Starts out jumpy but ends up okay. Love the artist very much so. Would like to get a better copy if possible.
2,Two Broken In Transit,"This review is not for the bowls, which look fine, but for inadequate packing materials. Two arrived completely broken. There were pieces of cardboard between each bowl, but certainly not enough material to prevent breakage. We are returning the set for a refund. Our final recommendation is to purchase these bowls at Target and not online."
5,delicious low carb bar,"these bars taste excellent and are very low in carbs and high in fiber.My only reservation is the primary protein source is soya,which is not great, particularly for men"
2,Not for beginers,"My ears and brain cannot possibly listen as fast as the Caller calls! You're doing one move and - literally in two seconds or less - he calls ANOTHER move! Seriously! And the Caller sprinkles in little expressions but they get in the way of my frantic brain trying to pick out an actual call. I attended a terrific square dance about five years ago and I had no trouble understanding and keeping up. This cd is for EXPERIENCED, fast-comprehending-brains ONLY! Cannot recommend. I'm soooo bummed! Got this for a Thanksgiving dance and now there's no time to replace."
3,Jan,The calls were fast and the dances were difficult for a first time Square Dance teacher. I was hoping for something for the true beginner. A video CD would also be helpful.
1,Do Not Buy This Phone,"While all of the basic features of this phone work fairly well, the most important feature - the battery life - is awful. You will notice that under Product Details, the battery life information is ""unavailable"". This is telling!!!Even after this phone is fully charged, I am only able to talk for about 45 minutes before the battery goes dead.Whatever the price for this phone, it is not worth buying!"
1,Bad,"It's hard to hear, and if you turn it up, it gets feedback. The battery goes dead after 10 minutes of talking, and it gets worse, it beeps for the last 5 of those minutes."
4,"Great bag for price, stuffs down to nothing, but wish zipper was longer","This is a good bag and an incredible price. It stuffs down to barely bigger than cantaloupe size with compression straps on the stuff sack, and is featherlight too.The one complaint is about the zipper. I'm guessing they saved money by only extending the zipper half way down the bag. This makes it a little harder to get into, especially in a cramped space like a bivy or 1 man tent, and also prevents you from being able to regulate heat by opening the zipper. Since this bag is intended for warm weather, you may find that it's _too_ warm at some point, but you're kind of stuck inside it from your waist down...Still, it was so cheap for a nice down bag that I can't complain too much, so I'm giving it 4/5 stars. If it had cost $100 I would have given it 3/5."
3,A very well written song but,"still It's Justin Timberlake and his girlie voice. Don't get me wrong, Justin Timberlake is not 100 percent talentless. I just have a hard time accepting that girlie voice. I can't stand when male singers hit all those high notes like they are Mariah Carey or something. he doesn't always sing girlie like on the verses of this song. If he could sing like he does on the verses of this song 100 percent of the time, I'd probably give his music (not just this song) 5 star ratings. Anyways, I gave this song 3 stars due to it's lyrics. It is a very well written song."
4,These are sooo cool!,"These are awsome...but like everyone else has been saying there are a couple of problems. They are a bit uncomfortable...but you DO get used to them...the lights do sometimes turn on because the button accidentally gets pushed but they automatically turn off. The little ummmm plug thingie doesn't fit right in my CD player either i have to move it around sometimes. Also I've only had mine since Christmas and they broke on the end where it says the model name..so i can't use them anymore..I used them everyday tho..But I am the only person who has these at my entire school! Everyone loves them! I'll walk down the hall and everyone stops and is like ""WOW! Where'd you get those way cool headphones"" luckily I got mine for a gift so I just say ""I donno I got them for Christmas."" but my parents actually got these from a store...hmmm.....well they are great....just don't put them in the bottom of your backpack or they'll break next time you try to put them on...:-) LOVE EM!"
4,The all-in-one book written for all.,"While written some time ago, the book's lessons still prove invaluable today. Covers everything you want to know, a to z. I also recommend Pandolfini's Weapons of Chess, an excellent book of short lessons."
2,Several out of date books have been rebound into one volume.,The analysis *frequently* leaves out the best moves. Some of the answers to puzzles in the tactical sections are not correct. (I verified this fact with my computer.) At least the principles Reinfeld espouses are useful for the beginner. Most of the individual volumes were originally published in the fifties and the analysis is often out of date. The publishers could have at least corrected the outright mistakes and updated the notation to algebraic. You would be much better off with a new book by Chernev or Pandolfini.
1,CAUTION !,"This book may teach you something if you don't even know how the pieces move. I have never seen such a large book with this much ""Fluff"". Fluff is basic, useless, words and diagrams meant to do nothing but take up space on otherwise blank pages. I purchased this book along with many others while living in Nevada. I purchased books and awarded them to the top students in our local chess tournaments. The ""winner"" of this book donated it to the school library after just a few days. After taking a closer look at it I couldn't blame her. This is an overpriced hardcover book.If you click on my name you will get my personal information and see a recommended study list. I put together this list of books and software with only one thing in mind...to improve your game without wasting your money. If you want to get better at chess this list will give you the most bang for your buck."
1,Bad Breath of Scandal,"If you're running short of clichés, you can find the mother lode in this book. It's fraught with unbelievable characters making idiotic choices. Women in particular are portrayed as incapable of rational thought. By the time you've read chapter one, the ending will be obvious. If you're determined to read this embarrassingly bad piece of bumf (look it up!), I recommend you get it from the library rather than spending actual money on it. What a waste of perfectly good tree!"
1,where is my order?,"i cannot review this order as i have not yet received it!!Ordered on 29/7/2012 ,why is it taking so long?"
3,could have been great...,"This book had such a great plot premise that it could have been great. It would even have made a pretty good movie. But she turned it into soft porn (as she nearly always does) and it seriously hurt the book. I'm no prude, but I don't need details of every move two people make in the bedroom to understand where the relationship went. Too bad; it really was a great plot, and the characterizations were pretty good, too."
3,"This story left me feeling disappointed, not smiling","This story was not Sandra's best work. There were to many different plots going on, not enough sexual tension, body tingling, imagination working in this story. A couple times I got lost and confused in this story."
1,bodice-burster with soft-corn porn sex,"This is a typical bodice-burster with explicit sexual detail that qualifies it as soft-core pornography. Why have none of the other reviewers mentioned this? If that's what you want (and apparently a lot of people do because it sells) buy this one. If you don't want your brain to turn into mush, and if your have or want to develop transcendant values, read something worthwhile."
4,Breath of Scandal,"Sandra Brown keeps you interested. Good story with colorful characters that you can relate to..........like and dislike. I like a bit more suspense, but all in all a good read for a rainy day."
4,4 1/2* A GREAT READ THE SECOND TIME AROUND!,"Read this one in first publication. Great read then...great read now! Sandra Brown writes a gripping story involving violence, greed, revenge and finally love."
4,Great Read!!!,"This is one of Sandra Brown's best books, I read it a long time ago and it is still a great read.."
4,Love Sandra Brown,"I read this book a number of years ago, and decided to read it again. The second time around, it was still very interesting reading. Sandra Brown is definitely my type of author."
5,Wow! A must read! Kharma's a #$^@#!,"This book was incredible! It was very difficult to read at times because of the brutal nature of the rape. However, in the end The Kharma Train comes around and they get what they deserve. It's an amazing journey to the end. This is a definite must read if you're a Brown fan. And if you're not, read it anyway!I really love that they also gave a detailed back story on Dillon in this book. I was very happy to see that they paired the two of them together to help heal each others life wounds. I'm also so excited about the way Jade ends up getting her revenge on the Patchett's. That was brilliant!!!"
3,"kinda good, kinda trashy","Seeing the high star count by amazon readers pulled me into another Sandra Brown book. I've enjoyed one of her books in the past (Envy) and given up on a few others. I always like Sandra Brown's female protagonist, this one being Jade Sperry (ala Jaclyn Smith?), they always seem to be someone you really want to root for as they get mistreated and victimized. Her male leads are always tough, cantankerous and in my opinion, a little too scummy for her female leads, but, oh well.Her sex scenes in this one were overdone and trashy, who needs all that? I don't know. Neil Patchett, her bad guy character is one of the baddest characters I've ever read. All in all good storytelling and an excellent audiobook reading by Dick Hill."
5,Sandra Brown at her best,"An absolute must read for any Sandra Brown fan. A young woman wronged by a small town ""good old boys"" system grows up to become a woman of strength. A woman who returns with vengence on her mind and a determination to right the wrongs her own way. I have read almost all of Brown's work and Breath of A Scandal and The Witness capture the top two spots!"
2,Whatever turns you on,"This is the first book I have read by Sandra Brown. She writes well, creates interesting characters though a bit too ""fit the mold"". I wish I could say I enjoyed the book, but I didn't. Revenge is a strong emotion, but the way this lead character devoted her whole life to it (taking some extreme risks in so doing)didn't endear her to me. I found her actions stupid at times and boring at others. If you like pink passion, this is a book for you as there is plenty of that--so much it distracts from the story itself. I suppose the reason a good author like Brown writes this kind of novel is that it sells--and selling makes money. More power to her. I will try another of her books before I judge her work on this one book, but right now i have my doubts that I will find anything different."
4,Idealized Realism,"This is a light book, not serious literary writing and a break from nonfiction books. That's not a negative things. It fits well in a diversified reading portfolio. While some plot devices seemed contrived, like the suicide and the resolution, the story was engaging. The enjoyment of the journey did not depend on the ending. A large element of the enjoyment was the believable psychology of the main characters. Jade, her best friend, her post-rape boyfriends. Their dialog and motivations seemed real enough to be engaging. The realism was idealized, however, both in the plot and in the physical descriptions of the bodies of the characters. Jade has had a child but her body seems to be unchanged from her high school years--no stretch marks or sags. The bodies of men also seem contrived--always hard and muscled. This isn't a deal-breaker because part of the fun is to imagine these ideal couplings, but would it ruin things to add a few physical details that all readers experience?"
4,I loved the book,"This is the first Sandra Brown novel I've read. I couldn't put the book down it was that good. Plus there was something shocking to happen at the end of some of the chapters. There is no way you can figure out what is going to happen. One of the readers commented that there was really no hot sex, which is very true but what is lacking in sex makes up in suspense."
4,This one was tough.,"Rape, assult, betrayal, abortion, lies, heartbreak, defeat, revenge, victory, joy, and love. ... it's all here.I was torn with this one. It starts out slow, but then suddenly you crash into everything. Horrible things just all happen at once, and I could not stop crying. I had to put it away. This one really hurt to read.It drew me in, but let me down in the end (hence only 4 stars) What heppened to the mother. I wanted that to be tied in at the end. And the reaction the son gave when all was revealed, that was not really believeable. All in all a very moving book. Certainly not your run of the mill romance novel."
5,A REAL PAGE TURNER!!,"This was a great book I couldn't put it down. I have read most of Brown's books and she continues to keep the suspense, heat and drama throughout the story, even to the last pages. I recommend any of her romance/suspense novels such as CHARADE, MIRROR IMAGE, FAT TUESDAY."
4,a real page turner,I found the book very entertaining and exciting. The author is very easy to read. A good beach novel.
3,Brown's annoying erotica prose,I really enjoyed this story. But Brown has an annoying habit of these overly descriptive second by second sex scenes which to me are irrelevelant and take on the temporary presence of a trashy novel. Why I need to know the rate and pace of intercourse or the method of which Jade's nipples are sucked.......is beyond me. It really adds nothing to the story except possibly exposing Brown's secret sex fantasies......they're overdone and tacky. Leave that cheesy crap out.
4,"A lot of tragedy, but a solid story","This is a story of revenge, redemption, healing, and a little romance. I'm still fairly new to Sandra Brown, but this was a really good one. Both the highs and the lows in the story are equally great. The only issue I had is that she uses the ""sudden tragic event"" as a plot device a little bit too much. There's a lot that happens in this story... rape, betrayal, pregnancy, suicide, AIDS, terminal illness, allergic reactions, accidental death, car accidents, heart attacks... it's a lot to take in. And I found myself getting frustrated with Jade when she wouldn't share what happened to her with those that cared about her. I wanted to yell, ""For cripe's sake, just tell them already!"" Yet, I could hardly stop myself from listening. Brown knows how to write sexual chemistry."
3,Mystery and Suspense Collection - Madacy,"This is an inexpensive disc from Madacy. ""NIght Train..."" is actually a fairly good print. While it hasn't been restored, the film quality is pretty good, with minimal scratching. The audio, like most British films of this period, is a bit below the quality of Hollywood films of the same time. Subtitles would be helpful to catch all the dialogue, but are not on the disc.""Cast..."" is not a good quality print. There is an audible hiss during much of the film, and there are some large scratches, white circles, etc. ""The Red House"" is much the same--very scratchy picture, and the music is a bit distorted when it gets louder.If NTTM is your main reason for buying this disc, it's worth it. Maybe someday the other films will be released in better condition."
2,Appears Accurate but Detached,While reading this I never felt Ume Tsuda leave the page and come to life. The book seems to have accurately researched the original letters from which most of this biography is sourced but then it is written with a detached perspective. Ume Tsuda should have written her own biography or had a close friend write it during her lifetime because this is so dry and antiseptic. Perhaps that is what you must get when the sources have all passed away and are not available for questioning.
5,Very good,Listen to it all the time. Perfect travel companion!! Its Clear and The Word Of GOD...I would recommend this to anyone!
2,Beware Audio,"The reading is great.The text is 100% KJV.The quality of the New Testament is just fine, as one would expect.But the audio of the Old Testament is just awful.Note: I am not criticizing Scourby; I am criticizing the mastering of these MP3s.It literally sounds like he is speaking from the bottom of a deep metal can.If you listen to this on a car or home stereo you can probably make the necessary audio adjustments to get along, but if you put it on an iPod: forget about it.I've attempted lab adjustments to the mp3's but to no avail.I have several MP3 Bible releases (NIV, NLT, etc.) and this is the only version with issues.Just letting you know my personal experience.So after 8 months of putting up with it, I'm going to try the Max McLean version."
2,Good Voice but Poor Quality,"I purchased this set to replace my old cassette version. I really like the King James Version, so I am happy about that. However, the overall quality of the product is poor. The recording levels are quite low meaning I really have to crank up the volume to hear Mr. Scourby. Also, I have two CDs (so far) with completely dead tracks. In other words, Genesis Chapter 21 and Samuel 30 are noise and nothing at all respectively.If you're looking for Bible on CD, move along. There are too many other decent products on the market to settle for this one."
4,Scourby has the best Bible voice...,I would like to be able to put it into my IPhone... but I need some way to organize the mp3 files
1,terrible,I TRIED TO DOWNLOAD THIS ON TO ITUNES IT WAS NOT IN ORDER ALL BOOKS WHERE COMBINED NOTHING WAS IN ORDER I HAD TO CREATE PLAYLISTS TO LISTEN TO IT. THIS PRODUCT IS TERRIBLE I WOLULD NOT TECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONBE WHO WANTS TO PUT THIS IN THEIR COMPUTER OR IPOD......NIGHTMARE
1,Wrong Christmas gift,I was buying the CDs and when I bought them I bought the tapes I am not very please I don't understand how this was but the person that was suppose to get them for Christmas was not excited. I am very disappointed.
5,Good quality,"Good audio quality for such a cheap price. I would definitely recommend this item. I'm only in Leviticus, but I love it!!"
4,Good Product,"Purchased this for my sister and when she did use it she said that she liked it! Deep voice, but still very clear."
5,great study tool,I use this to listen during my Bible reading. I read along with the recordings. Found no problem whatsoever and am a 53 year old non-tech guy. No sound quality issues and very easy to put on my computer. The whole new testament is on one disk with each book as a folder and each chapter in each folder. Great great tool especially for hard to pronounce names in the Bible.
2,Poor Sound quality,"Received this item today...March 13,2009.....Very disappointed... I think the sound quality is poor... The volume goes up loud and then goes low...makes it hard to set the sound to listen to....It distorts in places........ It would be ok if you did not have the means to read or such (This is better then nothing)....but otherwise I would pass on this item...and pick another."
3,"Wonderfully narrated, but flawed audio.","To have the complete KJV Bible on a 6 MP3-CD set is just amazing when you see that it can be bought for less than $20. Alexander Scourby's narration is brilliant. Audiophiles will not be satisfied with the audio quality of the recordings, however, as they are sometimes uneven from chapter to chapter (e.g. sound level and quality dramatically changing from chapter to chapter).For the money, I rate this as a strong buy.Make sure that your intended playback device can play MP3-CDs, as not all older players can."
2,Tried 3 times,1st disk set had a blank #2 cd and #6 won't copy everything.I tried it with 2 more sets and none worked completely.All had the same 2 disks bad.I had another set but just the new testament and 1 COR 6&7 didn't work.
1,Awful.,"I bought these for my grandmother for Christmas. Not one of them would work. We tried playing them in a regular CD player, DVD player, MP3 player in my car, etc. and NOTHING worked. Very disappointed."
2,...OUCH!,"These shoes are adorable, but they HURT! My feet were killing me within ten minutes of wearing them. I'm a teacher who is constantly on my feet, and I was excited to get Naturalizers, which are supposed to be made for comfort... not successful! I have tried to ""break them in,"" but the fact of the matter is, they just hurt!A cute pair of shoes if you don't plan on doing a lot of walking, but not very functional. Try Aerosoles instead; I've had great luck with their heels."
5,Great!,My daughter loves this book. She loves the sounds it makes and she loves reading it when she goes potty. It was exactly how it was described.
4,Perfect for the job,"I ordered this book because my daughter lives Dora, and I wanted to get her interested in potty training. I read other reviews before ordering, and. I think many of the negatives are overstated. I'm not sure what people are expecting from a potty book, but I hope parents teach their kidsblow to use the bathroom without expecting every detail to be included in the book. It covers the basic idea, all a book really needs to include. Also, the flushing sound is more than adequate, and my two year old knows just when to hit the button during the story. She recently started saying that she's a big girl like Dora and has been asking to use the potty."
4,Potty training,"This book is cute - it's Dora so no literary genius but she has her hold on our daughter and we thought readinga bout Dora using the potty would be a good motivator. The only dissapointment is that when we rec'd our book,the potty noise button is broken. It just doesn't seem worth the time or $ to ship it back for a new book. Amazon: if you're reading, please send another :)"
4,Good potty book for girls who like Dora.,"Nice book to help your kids with potty training..the button was a little hard to push in order to get the toilet flushing sound, especially for young kids..Not my kid's favorite thing to read/play with, but it does the trick in terms of being a good book to read while trying to go to the potty."
4,fun book,"I purchased this for my 18 month old daughter who LOVES Dora. She enjoyed the book & loved ""flushing"" it. The only down fall I had was the ""flusher"" button is not loud @ all & my daughter can't get it to work sometimes because its like there is a certain spot you need to press to work. It is still a great book for all Dora lovers & potty training."
2,"Good for toilet training, not for potty","I got this and realized it is for the potty seat for the big toilet, not for the potty itself which is frustrating since I think most people start with a potty as the big toilet is scary and too much for first time uses. I would be better to have Dora use a potty chair and then graduate to a potty seat for the toilet. My daughter does like the flushing sound button but it is too distracting and is all she wants to do rather than listen to the book. I hope they come up with more (and better) Dora potty training as it is her favorite and she is interested in anything Dora or Diego. A DVD would be nice too!"
2,It's the flush,The flusher button sounds like a dying toilet. It's annoying and sounds nothing like a toilet flushing! The story is ok and my daughter loves Dora so it's readable.
5,Too Cute,"I purchased this book for my 18 month old daughter who I am potty training. She adores Dora and I thought this book was adorable. The book has not increased our potty training success but it is still a cute idea. This book is very cute, and the flushing sound it makes made my daughter excited. The flushing sound is not very loud, but that is nice because it isn't annoying. All around I am very pleased with this purchase and so is my daughter."
4,Let's explore a new skill!,"My daughter adores Dora, so getting a little ""explorer"" help for potty training was a great idea for us. Although my daughter had trouble pressing the button on her own, she loved having me help her make the flushing sound. This book also worked well for us because we did use a potty seat that fit directly onto the toilet (my daughter is tall for her age). It took my daughter a little longer to perfect potty training than it did Dora, but this book was definitely a fun way to help her on her way. Now my girl is well on her way to being a big girl explorer too!(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

4,Dora's Potty Book,"My granddaughter loves this book. She is a big Dora fan and this book helps her in this developmental task she is undergoing. The book has colorful, topical and tasteful pictures. The book even makes a ""toilet flush"" sound! I would recommend it to all parents of ""toddlers in training"".Dora's Potty Book (Dora the Explorer)"
3,"Nice, did not help much","Daughter loves Dora, so when we began seriously potty training we purchased the book. The book really was never applicable to what we were using it for. Additionally, even with the sounds (nothing like a toilet), this is our daughters least favorite Dora book and NEVER asks to read it unless there is nothing else around.It is durable and I guess for someone else it may work."
2,Not impressed,"My toddler is a huge Dora fan, and she will like this book because it is a Dora product, but beyond that, it really isn't that great. The story line is unimaginative (once Dora was a baby and wore diapers, now she is a big girl and uses the potty) and it does not keep my daughter's attention all the way through. Too wordy! Also, the button to make the flushing sound is too difficult for her to push on her own."
4,Good Teaching Aid,"Although we are still in the process of training, my daughter loves reading her Dora Potty Book and pushing the button. She has several ""push the button"" type potty books and the Dora one is the quietest of these (depending on your view that good be a good or a bad thing). If you have a little Dora fan then this book should be a good choice for you. The language is basic and to understand. Wish us luck!"
4,"Fun, but not very educational","This book is fun and colorful, and my 2.5 year old likes pushing the button, which makes a very faint noise a little like a toilet flushing. One reviewer said the button is hard to push, but ours is not. This book doesn't really teach a lot about the potty training process, and it doesn't show Dora using the potty, so I would suggest also getting more instructive books for actual potty training: My Big Girl Potty (there's also one for boys) or Mr Rogers' potty book (with real photos of kids), for example. The value of this book, as I see it, is that it shows that even Dora once wore diapers and she made the transition to using the toilet, and that can make a child feel comfortable with the process, interested in it, and eager to be a big kid like Dora. That is well worth the price to me."
2,Useless,The book never actually shows Dora sitting on the potty so it doesn't help a child to model what to do.
3,If it didn't have a flushing button it would be 1 star,"About 1/2 the pages in this book actually are about the potty. At no time is Dora actually sitting on the potty! she's not even really in the bathroom at any point. seriously. you read that right.PRO--potty seat, not mini-potty.PRO--Has a flusher button. CON--The flusher button is giving out after only a few months.PRO--There is a father shown in the book, she likes that, fathers help with potty training too!PRO--She really likes Dora, and Dora looks like her more than other potty book characters."
2,Not very helpful,"I was excited about this book because my daughter loves Dora and it shows the big toilet with the little kid's seat (which is what I am planning to train with.) There is one big problem though...it never shows Dora actually sitting on the potty. Maybe the Nickelodean people thought it was bad for the brand, but sitting on the potty actually is a pretty important part of potty time!"
5,Incredible!!,"The books in this series are absolutely incredible. The characters are very well developed, they are historically rich, and they are easy and fun to read. I read them until the covers were falling apart and I had parts of them memorized. I highly recommend them to anyone - even those who don't usually enjoy reading."
5,A Must Have,"The Jesus Dread compilation of Yabby U's work is one of the most important top 10 at least reggae albums anyone should own. Crafted like a fine architect, this album reflects all that reggae music is about. TRUTH. Beyond the hype of what's good reggae and Bob Marley (no pun intended) if you don't have Yabby You, you don't have reggae."
1,The Wackest Wagon Train in the West,"Well, This movie was not what I had expected at all. It was a flop within the firstfive minutes of viewing. You had some great actors involved, but the script they were trying to act out was truly sad to watch. I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,'After school' made for TV movie,"Budget was obiviously extremely limited - I don't get the 4 and 5 star reviews - just finished watching it and it was 'ok' at best. Lot of boring parts. Definitely a 'rental' and even then, it's a 2 star movie."
5,Great Movie,I saw this & wanted to keep a copy it is very true to Irish Drinking Family's especially with Secrets & abusive Fathers
3,Do not last long,"Balls look fine but for fairly use (couple times a day) they do not last long, they do not look nice anymore and shows signs of impact on most of the balls, cheap do not mean fairly good."
4,Crossing Over with the Sheepfarmers Daughter,"This is one of those Science Fiction/Fantasy Crossover books that I don't usually enjoy. I tend to like hard Space Opera style SF, but I do like Elizabeth Moon, and after reading this I still do. She writes one hell of a story, and right from the first chapter to the end of the third book, you will be making time to read this book."
3,Bad proof reading,"This is a wonderful set of books, but I'm not sure I have seen more ""spell-check"" errors in a published work in my life... Nearly every other page has the WRONG word correctly spelled... just one letter wrong, but one must re-read the same sentence several times to figure out what is being said...Very annoying...!"
2,"Slow, Plodding","Sheepfarmer's Daughter starts with awesome premises: A sheepfarmer's daughter makes good; she commits herself to a life for which she has passion; she is a person of character, mercy and dedication. That is where its appealing characteristics end.It plods. It spends much time in the nitty-gritty aspects of recruitment and training. Being an Army veteran, I think the more interesting aspects of the story lie elsewhere. I can read biographies and analyses on military training in the Middle Ages.I barely finished this book and did not move on to the others. I think the litmus test for pacing is R.A. Salvatore. Never plodding, never slow, always interesting (sometimes silly or stupid, but redeemingly so). I hope Elizabeth Moon takes a few pages from his writing style."
1,I don't get it..I thought it was awful...,"I absolutely do not understand how anyone could like this book. I HATED it. I was unable to finish it. I found it to be plodding, jerky, and unpolished. The main character just went from one battle to another, and none of the battles she fought seemed to me to have any exciting characteristics to differentiate them. Also, some of the fantasy language was just ridiculous! For example, and I still laugh about this to myself sometimes, having read this book two years ago (Well, part of it, I really couldn't finish it.), an officer asks her if she's a lesbian, he says: ""Are you a sisli?"" I don't know, I just found the whole book to be a ridiculous, and ridiculously boring affair."
5,Great fantasy...,"Although I have read most of the great fantasy writers as Tolkien, Jordan, Eddings, Brooks etc. I consider this series one of the best"
3,the life of a soldier,"the life of a soldier. at first i thought of it as kind of dull. P joins an army ans learns the life of a soldier. contains lot of details about her learning, training, formations etc. it is quite interesting. gets very realistic. Moon is great at describing the soldier's life. battles are described a little bit different, coming from the one soldier's point of view."
1,How do you get it to work?,I was really looking forward to seeing the art but I put the CD's in and nothing happened. At all! I knew it wasn't my computer and tried all of the CDs. What a disappointment. I returned it and hope to find something similar that works! Maybe I just got a bad set.
3,"Misnamed, but a lot of fun","The package should more properly be called ""Great Art Museums of Europe"", since there are a lot of great museums that aren't art museums, and a lot of great art museums that aren't in Europe. However, ignoring this technicality, the software is a lot of fun. It includes two CDs that cover major European museums, and three CDs dedicated exclusively to the Louvre. Everything is organized around ""tours"", available on a variety of art styles, regions (mostly in Europe, with a special section for the Egyptian collection in the Louvre), and topics (from the Virgin Mary to eroticism). If you aren't looking for anything in particular, it is great to just sit back and let the tours run. If you try to go beyond the tours, however, it is not so good - the interface is navigable, but not intuitive, and the works included are comprehensive at the masterpiece level, but thin out very quickly below the point of ""everyone has heard of it""."
5,Value and Scope,"This is amazing for the money. For those of us who long, and I mean long, for a trip abroad, this is well worth many times the cost. I run a 633MHZ, Intel Celeron and it runs like a dream. Very authentic in atmosphere and effect. The scope is wonderful - a taste of the architecture, the art, and the history.You must understand that I am of the older generation - we were stuck with expensive books or saving for these trips. Maybe that is why this tour seems so valuable to me.What can I say? Hey, I'm happy..."
4,Money well spent!,"This is a fine bunch of CDs. There's not a whole lot of art from the last century--they might have included a bit more modern stuff--but overall it offers a fine, sizable collection of art. Beyond that, I would recommend this because it is the perfect match of form and format; the art looks better on a computer screen than in does in a text, and you can click in for close-ups and details that enlarge with astounding clarity. If these guys come out with CD's focusing on modern art--or architecture--I will be in line to scoop them up."
3,Loved 2/5 of these CD-Roms,"There are 3 CD-Roms dedicated to the Louvre, and 2 for other assorted European museums. My favorites are the 2 assorted (The Hermitage,etc.)with the focus on art masterpieces. The Louvre program focused on portraits and historical pieces. Had difficulty loading multiple discs under original program for initial disc."
1,Could be very good but...,"This program is very buggy. We couldn't get it to run properly on two different computers. From what we were able to see, it could be a very good program if you could get it to work, so it does get one star for potential. One major problem is that error messages came up in Italian and we didn't have our English/Italian dictionary handy to figure it all out."
2,Technical problems with Great Museums,"The five cd's required individual setup for each one. Never could get the third Louvre disk (Egyptian/Italian Art) to load properly. Tried two different computers. Initial viewing of other disks look interesting and informative. I sometimes get a peculiar ""double exposure"" appearing presentation on the slide shows. I don't know if it is a problem or is intended as some artsie effect. I guess I have paid more for worse programs."
3,MAC Discrimination,"I bought this product when I was running a laptop PC. Fortunately, I did not have any of the technical problems that have been experienced by some other reviewers. I found the programs quite comprehensive, not so elementary as to be insulting and visually well done. The music was a good touch.Having said all that, why in the world is it not MAC-compatible? Now that I have switched to MAC, this software is useless. Any software that claims to be of interest not only to interested adults but to school-age learners should not have this shocking shortcoming. In all the time since I first bought this product, CounterTop Software has done nothing for the non-PC user. The three stars were for the PC content I used to be able to enjoy, after considering the fact that all I can do now is stare at the disks. Great.Steven M. WolfVillanova, PA"
5,Still Laughing,"This book is great! Strange little funny short stories that take you places you've never been before. If you don't mind a couple dirty words, but do like absurd hilarity I highly recommend this book!"
5,Genius!,"I don't just toss around the word ""genius"" like an everyday washcloth, so you know I mean business when I use the word ""genius"" to describe the fantastical writings of one Adam Cochran. This book may not change the world, but it could. At times side-splitting, at times deeply penetrating in it's ability to satirize and mock conventioal wisdoms that have all too easily become the norm. Sheer brilliance in it's cuuning and under-stated manner of humor."
5,A Good Laugh,"The author has written a strange, but very funny little book. The book consists of probably 75 one or two page stories. The stories are a little like Jack Handy's, only a little more twisted. I thought Disturbed Writings was a great book and a fun read."
3,Stupid and Strange. . .but worth your while.,"Caught up in the Hustle & Bustle of life? Tired of paying bills? Still upset about the salami submarine sandwhich that gave you extreme heartburn from the night before? Want to remember how it felt like to...? Look no further than ""The disturbed writings of Adam Cochrane"". Let's face it - this book sure won't make you smarter. In fact - it might make you dumber. But it does make you think about the world, and it does make you realize that you could be a lot crazier than you are. Cochrane's short stories and poems are just downright stupid. Some are funny - most are not. I'm not sure how this [strange] got published, but it did occupy 2 hours of time reading it. It's full of crude and offensive humor for most readers, and provides a short escape from life's negative aspects. After reading this book, I sit back and realize how lucky I am to be alive. A decent read,nonetheless."
2,"Not Great, Barely Decent. Barely.","I bought this book following the advice of other readers, and I am sorry to say that it just isn't very good. A few (actually one) great moments (Good EMT Bad EMT), but the book as a whole is just not good. Do yourself a favor and get a Woody Allen book like ""Getting Even."" This book lacks cleverness. I definitely don't recomend this book. I wanted to like it, but I was vastly disappointed."
5,Excellent cookware,I am completely satisfied witht he Pinzon 3.5 Quart Stainless Steel Sauce Pan with Lid. I learned about the pan from an article in Cooks Illustrated magazine who recommended the pan highly.
4,Pinzon pot pleasant pleasure,"I've been house keeping for fifty years.I have used an odd assortment of cookware during this time. Among them,a pan over sixty years old. I recently purchased a new stove that called for flat bottom pans. My warpped assortment had to go. I turned to Cooks Illustrated for advice on just what might be a good buy for someone already over half used up herself. They said the Pinzon pans were excellent and a good buy. They were right. I can't believe what I got for under one hundred dollars.They work great! I haven't burnt a single thing in these lovely, heavy bottomed skillets and pans. I love them! What shall I cook next?"
4,Great,"We loved our sink. It was sturdy and well made. The only two issues we found were that 1. it scratched very easily, and 2. we disagreed about which side the dishes should be washed/rinsed in - the smaller or the larger."
3,Just good not great.,Good thing about this player it is small.Easy to jog or weight lift with.Negative side it only fits about 1.3 GB.So so you have to high speed dub drivefor your PC to work with the MuVo.Also if you get this player best go toCreative Labs for Firmware updates.Why because it transfer mp3 slow otherwise.Would I buy another Nomad Movu 1.5GB no.But I would buy another Creative Labs Product.I also own 128MB Nomad Muvo MP3 Player its greatcompare to the bigger more expensiveNomad MuVo 1.5 GB MP3 Player.
5,totally worth $35!!!!,"Electric President is so good. I don't know who the singer is, but she sounds hot.Seriously, buy this."
3,organ music,An impulse buy for an old Hammond organ with a tube amplifier meant a need for organ music. This may augment the organ adventures of keyboard players.
3,Driveworks is not that bad...,"If you use Win Nt, 2K, XP with NTFS partition, you better not to try this driveworks. I tried it on my workstation that has an Adaptec RAID and Win Nt on it, and it didn't work.But, this driveworks work fine on my laptop which has a Windows ME with FAT32 on it. I can resize the partition without destroying it, image the partition, and had succesfully restored the partition from that image.So my complains:- VCom, please make this product works with RAID card and better handling with NTFS- It took almost 2 hours to make an image of 4GB partition!! (on a pentium III 750Mhz.. bleh)Otherwise, this software might be worthful for anyone who use FAT/FAT32."
5,Best 'toy' ever!,I own the original (v1.0) Robotics Invention System the year it came out. I've used it for school projects and it's an excellent gateway to more advanced robotics. I now create my own sensors for Mindstorms and program it in a different language. The challenges are fun and the expansion sets make it even more fun. Anyone interested in robotics must get this product!
4,A Problem with the 1.5 RCX (center computer),"This kit is the pinnacle of the Technics world, giving independence to the creations of our youth! With a little skill at design, and a little fun with the computer interface, you can make some of the neatest things!Be warned, though -- the 1.5 RCX is known to have no AC adapter port, which limits the time it can be off doing cool stuff. LEGO has not explained why this is the case, but if you really love playing you'll need to invest in a NiMH battery set (AA) and charger, or call LEGO and ask them to 'downgrade' your RCX.If you get past the initial designs of the guidebook and software, check out additional books here (Dave Baum's Definitive Guide to LEGO Mindstorms/1893115097, The Unofficial Guide to LEGO MINDSTORMS Robots/1565926927, among others) for ideas and directions."
1,Disappointed,"5 weeks and 11 telephone calls have passed and yet my son still does not have an RCX box (yellow brick) that works, rendering the system useless. It took 5 telephone calls, numerous transfers to various personnel and hours of wasted time just for the technical support people to concur that the yellow brick was indeed defective. Although there have been many promises to return phone calls,check into the situation and/or send a replacement part, it has not happened (only 1 of the 6 promises to return a phone call occurred). The customer support does not have the ability to directly send a replacement part, they apparently have to go through another company, which they have no control over. Buy this at your own risk, hoping that the parts all work."
3,One week of pure bliss but then...,"The Lego mindstorms was great for one week, but after you build all of the step-by-step machines it becomes really boring. Unless you come up with a brilliant idea, it is basically impossible to do anything else with it. Lego put the age of 12+ on it, but I would reccomend at least 14+. Although I could see the potential of it for someone buying it for education, it is a waste of money getting it to play for fun. Buy a PC game instead."
3,"Some good movies, somewhat over hyped","Hollywood came into it's own in the 30's after the code was in place.Not until the late 50's was the ""Code"" really challenged.But even in the 20 and early 30's what we see in ordinary European films of today would have been banned? Sin isn't new, but I guess modern civilization has gotten much better at it than in these more innocent days.My objection with this collection is not the good films in it,but the presumptive ""sale of sin"" label given these films."
3,Not impressed how Warner claims exclusivity here,I was dissapointed how in the documentary (so obviously biased here toward product under Warner licence) there was absolutely no mention of Mae West - the biggest thorn in the moralists side and one of the main targets in the move toward cleaning up of motion picture production post 1934. Shame on you Warner Home Video for blowing your own trumpet in such a blatantly misleading and commercial way to those audiences exploring this era of film for the first time! Real coffee table stuff trying to be credible and of substance. Misses by a mile.
2,Poor Quality Recordings,"I'm sorry to be negative about this product but something is wrong with the production process and it is not Amazon's fault. Amazon very graciously replaced my first order in which Disk 1 (of 3) was bad - it stopped playing and would not restart. They even reimbursed the shipping cost. Unfortunately, in the replacement set all 3 disks refused to play all the way through. Amazon has done all they can do to make it right. I just feel that the producers of Forbidden Hollywood, Vol. 2, should do a better job of quality control."
2,Grip-tote chuck,"I've used it twice and each time it leaked too much air to get proper inflation, I will try it a few more times and review it again."
4,The Frogmen,"I was a Frogman in WW11 so it was easy to double Richard Widmark in this one. The picture is very close to accurate. The tanks used were different from what I had and the suits were somewhat different. However, this is in the Pacific and I was in Europe. Very good depiction of the real thing. I enjoyed working on ths picture and you will certainly enjoy watching it."
4,The Frogmen,Watching this when it first came out inspired my son to become a Navy SEAL. He retired after 27 years. I sent this to him.SEALs call themselves 'Frogs' rather than frogmen. I enjoyed it when I saw it.
5,All Classics,"I bought this mainly for ""Sink the Bismark,"" and was not disappointed. I had forgotten about the other three movies, all great in their own right. Four great movies for the price one, can't be beat."
3,Okay movid,Would not recommend. This is an old movie. I was dissappointed in the quality of the film. If is okay entertainment.
3,Not to Accurate but a fair movie,Not very accurate about the equipment used. Three tank set-ups were not used at that time. Hollywood stuff Widmark using blue shorts with white strip. Seaman wearing white hats in war zone. The ship was an APD which was an old converted seaplane tender It's name and number was the USS Klinesmith APD 734 Guess how I know.
4,Fascinating,"I am a grandmother and I orderd this movie for my son who is a scuba diver. He's not getting it, I'm keeping it. Once again Widmark shows newer actors how it's done."
5,Excellent movie and tribute,"My father was a member of the UDT teams during WWII and through the 1950's. One of the great things about this movie is that the real men of the UDT were often used. The footage of the teams using the boat and swimming underwater were done by the actual UDT team 4, they also used them in other places in the movie. During the scene where Richard Widmark is talking to the men while they are laying in their bunks my father can be easily seen in the top bunk to his right, other men in this scene were also members of UDT 4."
4,"Frogmen, a different look at WW2","Not the typical WW2 spif. Plot is familiar with new Cmdr. trying to fit in and win the loyalty of his men. Enough action to keep the movie interesting. Shows importance of the Underwater Demolition Teams. If you like WW2 navy films, this would be worth viewing."
4,New to me,"Thinking myself a WWII film-buff, I was pleasantly surprised to come across a movie that I had never heard of. Richard Widmark has never been one of my favorite actors (his best role in my opinion was Jim Bowie in The Alamo), I was a little skeptical of what I would find in The Frogmen. While he's still not very animated, this was a good Friday night with pizza and popcorn movie, and one that I'm glad I picked up."
5,Free yourself to be healthy,A wonderful guide to using your mind to optimize your health and your life. Overview of holistic practices to enhance health and overcome illness. I read and reread this book to remind myself that my mind is intimately linked to my body and that I have much more control than is generally believed. This book has helped me onto the path for recovery from chronic health problems.
5,I need to learn how to speak better!,"This is my second copy! I had marked up the first copy so much, highlighting passages, dogearing pages, penciling in comments in the margins, that I wanted a fresh copy to go through it again with fresh eyes. It has some very important messages and backs them up with references and suggestions for further reading. Excellent book."
2,still no shower,"The length was perfect, it would have gone over the shower surround to just the right spot so showers would not be awkward...but just as one of the previous review stated, even with a cloth over it, it got scratched to the point that I cant, in all good conscience, use it in this brand new bathroom...save your money and find a different product."
4,Bear Jacket,"Great overall coat. very warm, yet lightweight. Extremely fitted so order a size larger than you need."
3,"Great chips, but a little too salty for my liking","Considering these are baked, they are very tasty. They are super crispy and taste like fried goodness, but without the oiliness. The only bad thing I have to say is that these are supposed to be ""lightly"" salted but I still found them overly salty (that's why I only gave it 3 stars). I actually found the Baked Salt & Malt Vinegar ones less salty than these. So for those watching their sodium intake or don't like things too salty, then you may want to consider the other flavors."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I had high hopes for these chips, I love the Kettle Brand and I love cheddar. But they were TOO crisp,they were sharp and hard. And the taste was salty but it didn't remind me of good aged cheddar at all."
1,Burnt Chips,The chips have dark rings from overcooking and have a burnt taste. I contacted manufacturer but no reply. Hugh disappointment.
1,Not Good,"So you want some tasty flavorful potato chips, seriously why bother with these. Please understand they are baked. Even so, they taste like seasoned cardboard. Ur better off with a rice cake. Or how about you walk around the block and then enjoy a handful of the standard kettle chips, well worth it!This product Skip!"
3,Disappointed with Freshness Date,"My husband and I are on Weight Watchers and eat these chips frequently because they are much lower in fat than regular chips. One serving is equal to 2 Weight Watchers points (old point system). It seems that the local stores are always out of them so I ordered through Amazon, but was disappointed in the freshness date. All 15 bags had a freshness date of August 11, which was much too close to the date ordered. The ones I bought at the grocery store in June had a freshness date of October. Although we eat these almost daily, we won't be able to consume 15 bags by August 11, and did not want to be bothered with the hassle of returning them."
5,Great Value thru Amazon!,These are $3.79 a bag at my local grocery - 15 bags at $34 is a great price. These arrived fresh at the end of April with a best buy date of late August. Great chips!
5,best potato chip,These chips are the best chips ever. They are thick and crispy. No chip compares.These chips are gluten free. And should be considered a gluten free grocery. Ordering by the case really saves money compared to grocery store.
5,Excellent alternative to fat fried chips,"Full of flavour and crunch without the oily aftertaste,fantastic product. YummmmPackaging needs to better or UPS more careful when handling."
4,Baked Pototoe Taste-Gluten Free,"Good alternative to the typical baked potatoe chips which are usually filled with other additives like corn and artificial ingredients. They're relatively low fat and taste like the real thing. My only complaint is that they are very salty even thought the manufacturer claims that they are ""lightly salted""."
2,Makes me cough . . .,"These chips aren't bad when it comes to taste and I like the extra crispiness, but the spice they use makes me cough. I have to make a conscious effort to hold it in if I eat one or else they literally come flying out. It's something in the spice that just hits the back of my throat. I'm a huge BBQ lover when it comes to chips and have never had this problem. I ended up just throwing the bag away because it wasn't worth the embarrassment!"
4,very good low calorie chips,"best low calorie chip yet. hard to tell that they are baked. very, very good!!"
5,Great Chips!,These are a great snack for those who love potato chips and want to watch their fat intake. The flavor is very delicious!
1,Chip lover,The chips that were delivered have little to no barbeque seasoning on them which makes them pretty bland. I get seasoning on every third chip. Keep in mind it is the seasoning that makes the chips worth buying.
1,weird aftertaste,"They taste great while you're eating them...but wheeeeew...the aftertaste is awful. Not only that, it's very hard to get rid of. I like the sea salt, and the white cheddar, but the sea salt and vinegar is the my favorite (very, very, salty)."
2,What's with the salt?,"When I received this item it was labeled ""Sea Salt."" In fact, the Sea Salt version of these chips is also described as ""lightly salted,"" so you might think the two were one and the same. However, these are listed as having 115g of sodium per serving, while the Sea Salt version has 135g of sodium per serving. If this matters to you like it matters to me, stipulate that you receive the Lightly Salted version ONLY."
3,okay.,This drum is alright. Probably a bit young for my 2 1/2 year old. I think he'd rather bang on a bigger drum myself.
5,So cute,This little drum was exceptionally made and perfect for little hands. It's great for marching around the room and the mallet is very safe.
5,Instant hit,"Got this for my friend's 1 year old daughter. She started playing with it right away! The sound is pleasant to hear, not tinny like the common plastic drums, because this is made with Remo heads."
4,Small with a great sound,"I didn't realized from the picture just how small this drum is. However, despite it's size it sounds great. My nine month old son loves to bang on his drum with the easy to hold drum stick....when he's not chewing it that it....LOL.Cute, colorful and sounds great even though it's tiny."
3,Plays fine but small,"I knew it wasn't going to be big but it seems very small. My kid doesn't give it a lot of love. Quality build, just small."
2,Didn't work that well,"My 1-year old first thing was to bite a piece of the mallet, then never really showed that much interest in the toy. The drum seems ok, but doesn't sound that good when placed on a carpet for example."
3,Toothmall!,"This is a tiny Remo drum, with a foam mallet. While the drum sounds good, it is really only suited for an infant. My 10 month old has already out grown it. Also, the mallet had to be taken away as soon as he had a couple teeth - he was able to bite a big chunk out of it."
3,IF YOUR A FAN OF THE SERIES LIKE ME YOU'LL LIKE IT! WHERE IS PART 2 ON DVD?,"I am a fan of this director's work. This film is way over the top, but if you are a fan you'll enjoy this movie. I do not understand why there isn't a DVD release for the Basket Case 2 in the U.S.? They released Basket Case 3 why not complete the trilogy? Look for more of this director's films( Frank Henenlotter )if you like something different."
2,Enough Is Enough!,"This film shouldn't be taken that seriously, it's awful & dumb. Some of the reviewers seem really [upset]! I don't blame them.The original ""Basket Case"" movie was a well made chiller. Part 3 scrapes the bottom of the barrel. It picks up where part 2 ended... almost the same ugly faces star in this one too.Avoid watching this while you're eating. A Low budget, uninteresting little film.What else can one say..."
1,Lettuce does not make a film,"Alright, I've seen some pretty bad films in my day, but this takes the cake. It can't even touch such quality works as Manos: Hands of Fate or Troll in terms of badness. There is absolutely no point to this film, and I suggest that you remember that before even dropping 99 cents on it when you go to rent it at the video store. The only possible purpose of this film is to torture your friends, but if you are sitting through the 90 minutes yourself, it almost isn't worth it. Avoid this film unless heavily, heavily inebriated. Whatever themes and serious ideas people try to say are in this film don't exist. Please, avoid this, if not for my sake, for yours."
1,review by the REAL DownRok,"YEah man what was with that movie? Its about this freak (basket case) who is a head with two arms where his ears are supposed to be) The momsters are not threatening at all and one of em always smashes S#@* up with his head. This was the first movie shown at Dane tour 2000. And how does basket case get his own litter of little basket cases- hes clearly lacking all neccesarry equipment. And dont get me started on the thing with th teeth. If you want to know more about this crazy romp thru the twisted universe of basket cake, then read my other review I wrote (see above) and that should be enough to frighten away potential buyers. P.S. please dont censor my review, you guys."
1,BASKET CAKE 3- bad picture.,"this is by far one of the first most terrible feature I ever done saw.There is a guy with wierde teeth. The guys in the look like not people ,but momsters instead with very stupid teeth.I done saw the picture at the TV and it doesnt make the sense.the guys in there are supposed to be disfigured guys, but look like monsters and not real guys or guys who are real but just freaks. (i know a guy with 3 legs.) There is a guy with all these arms and he looks like Humplik. Its nuts. No you don't get it, they look like these things, not deformed people. Its nuts. You guys are nuts."
3,Not what I expected,"Good story, but the acting was bad and the script was very unnatural. We were pleased, however, that the movie was so family-friendly and had almost nothing objectionable."
5,watch this!!!!,I'm not a big movie watcher. But this is a must! God Bless to all involved!!!! I ordered 4 more for now to give to my family and will buy more and all I ask is they pass it foward for someone else to watch and so on.
5,Flag of My Father,"Great movie, well worth the watch, very well done! Get your tissues ready! Everyone I loaned the movie to loved it too. Amazon service was great as always!"
1,"Great Story, Awful Acting","1. It continues to amaze me how folks can confuse reviewing a movie vs making critical comments about the subject of the movie. This is a classic example of how the story of this movie has actual potential. However, the amazingly awful acting (as well as substandard writing) ruin the entire affair. For those who are hoping for a solid patriotic type movie, will get the patriotic part in this movie, but will have to suffer through high school level acting (and writing).2. A word to the wise, skip this dud."
3,I enjoyed this read!,"I enjoyed Dare's story...Not as hot as Delaney's but a nice read...I look forward to reading more books by brenda Hampton...next on the list for me is ""Thorns Challenge"""
2,Disappointment from Desire,"I'd heard what a good author Ms. Jackson was and was excited to see her added to the rolls of Desire authors. I purchased ""A Little Dare"" anxious to read about an AA hero and heroine. However from the first few pages I could tell that this book did not compare to the majority of Desires. The story line is good -- woman and her son return to her home town to get him away from bad influences and run smack into her old flame AND the father of her son. However, the dialogue is unnatural and often forced. The porch scene that everyone seems to be raving about lacks sensuality that is the hallmark of the Desire line. And the love scenes embody a touch of kinkiness that aren't normally found in this line. I won't be searching out the previous book in this series nor will I purchase further books in it. All in all, it was a big disappointment and waste of good reading time."
1,Should be MINUS 5 stars,...This could of been the perfect secret baby book but instead it turned into a raunchy sex story complete with looming breasts and terrible euphemisms. The sex isn't realistic (unless you want to buy into black stereotypes) and there isn't the usual dark moment in the plot where the guy and girl are driven apart by something and then have to work to get back together again. I sure won't be buying any more of her books.
4,A Little Dare,"Even though this book came out a few years ago, I just found time to read it. It was great and I was not disappointed. I have been enjoying all the of the Westmoreland series. Brenda Jackson shows how much love a family can have, which makes them extra special. This book didn't miss - had romance and some humor. I highly recommend."
4,Second chance love,"I like second chance love stories and this one is no exception. At least we did not have the usual 'hero and heroine fall out over some misunderstanding drama' which is a change. This is a nice, refreshing, sensual love story of a man wanting and getting the woman he loved and lost and a son in the proces. The only thing is I wondered how the average 10 year old would feel being manipulated,it would have been more interesting if he found out and what is response would have been"
4,A Classic,"I have been buying Fishboy t-shirts and caps for my brother for years. This was the second of this particular shirt I got for him, to replace the worn out one. He loves them and always gets a laugh from people."
1,garbage,"this product is complete garbage. the plastic is so thin that I don't want to put my 21oz cue in it for the fear that it will break on my way to the pool hall.it's made out of 1/128"" plastic with a piece of material on the inside and a bad zipper.the place where the handle is attached looks like a blind person put it together.and it looks nothing like the picture.it's toooooooo shinynot sturdyand mine came with a sticker that said ""gotta go to mo's""...DO NOT BUY THIS."
2,It should have been better for the money,"I bought a Minnesota Fats Hustler 4-piece cue and it barely fits in. Nylon coating makes it shiny/girlish. It would be better with a shoulder strap instead of a tacky hand strap. It has a small inner pocket, but the zipper is short and it's hard to tuck anything else in."
3,"cute, but thin....","nice, cute shirt, but it is pretty thin, it come in a nice box for mailing, which makes it great for a gift, but it is a bit overpriced."
5,"SUPER CUTE, SUPER SOFT","My 18 month old has the long sleeve versions of the CUPCAKE, PUMPKIN & PEANUT. The cotton is supersoft and they wash well. They come adorably packaged--ready for gift giving. I actually saw these shirts in a Miami kiddie boutique for $30 each! This is a great buy."
4,Wonderfully soft,Soft and lovely. I'd love to dress my kid in those t-shirts everyday! And the packaging is so thoughtful. It makes a perfect little present for your little loved ones.
2,Cubby Needer?,"If you are looking for a cheap organization system, you have found one. It's not expensive nor is it made well. I ordered 5 of these bins which get a fair amount of use. The drawers are constantly coming off of their ""hinge"" and the pegs that hold them in place will break. When they come out of their ""hinge"" it is difficult to put them back. A simple drawer would have been much more efficient."
1,Critical flaw in Videoshop 4.5,"I used Videoshop 4.5 to edit and add effects to movie clips I captured with iMovie and a digital camcorder attached with Firewire to my iMac DV. After pasting together 12 minutes of footage into a single QuickTime movie with Videoshop I discovered that the AUDIO AND VIDEO DRIFT OUT OF SYNC AFTER A FEW MINUTES! I found out that several other people have had this problem, and as far as I know there is no solution for it. Don't bother with Videoshop. I recommend iMovie and Final Cut Pro instead."
4,the best of the best,this program is the best not only because it is a little bit of money. I have benn making a lot of home movies and I think this program makes the movies look so much nicer!
2,There are better books about Peru,"After being in Peru, this book does not represents the country at all, from a non anglo-saxon point of view. It seemed to me that the writer went there with a closed mind, considering himself and his group superior to the rest. I found this book nothing but a pile of exagerated lies. Far from attracting me, it completely repels me"
2,From a student forced to use this...,"Until this year, when I had to use this textbook, I LOVED history. It was my favorite subject next to English, and I often bought my book home to read it for fun. I especially enjoyed American history and selected parts of European history, specifically the English, French, German...However, when I received this book this year, I was stunned. Not only was it extremely heavy and hurt my back from carrying it every day, but it was DULL. He somehow managed to make history tedious. When we had to take notes on a section, one would literally have to copy every sentence. There may have been a lot of information [believe me, there is!], but it was not presented in an interesting manner at all. Maybe for someone who dislikes history it won't be so bad, but it drove me mad."
2,A student in Georgia who used this book.,"This book manages to confuse-the-heck out of the reader by its poorly executed editing and lackluster written content.Its many examples of contradicting content, the obvious failure of the many contributors in correlating their facts, along with the poor editing, contribute to its confusion and overall boredom. This text should be pulled from use and publication! Rated it two stars only because the chapter on WWII was darn good (the only part in the book that made sense, and yes, I read the whole book).Pity the poor individual who is forced into using this extremely bad example of a history text book. Beware."
2,My review below this one is NOT for this text book!,"This review was mistakenly placed upon this text by myself, it is not for this text!This Review is meant for the text book: ""World History Since 1500, Volume II by William J. Duiker, Jackson J. Speilvogel"".I hearby retract this review as of 09/06/02 for ""World History text by William J. Duiker, Jackson J. Spielvogel""."
3,Worst album of Amr Diab!,"But it's not his fault. Habibi is a wonderful song (original Habibi, I mean). But this 10 remixes of Habibi.. most of them are similar Euro beat and some had R&B flavor with Habibi. Honestly it's boring. After I played this CD once, it made me feel I didn't want to play this CD again. Maybe some UK musicians thought his music was unique and interesting, then they probably thought it would be more unique and interersting by adding Euro beat and R&B to Habibi, but apparently it didn't successful, I think. (it depends on how they remix, not Euro beat and R&B's fault). I should have bought other original album of Amr Diab instead of this....."
3,Disappointing!!,I ended up only liking one or two of the remixes. That can be a problem with these remix CD's where only one song is highlighted. I think I would have been better off if I bought a compilation CD of this song remixed with other similar songs of this genre. That is where I heard the remix anyway that lead me to this CD.
5,Rumpole #2,"I read Rumpole when I need a laugh or to relax. All the usual characters and suspects all in regular form, Rumpole missing the point. SWMBO being her normal exasperated self at Rumpole and the various judges and barristers QC's etc. mixed together into a familiar blend. I bring my glass of Chateau Fleet Street and sit back and chill out."
3,"Not Really ""Inside Cream""","This story of Cream is told as a retrospective years later mostly by music journalists (who may or may not have been even writing reviews at the time), producers, with the occasional chord demonstration by a guitarist who was probably in diapers in the '60s. There is minimal performance footage and only occasional snatches of an interview with Jack Bruce. The title is a misnomer and misleads you into thinking it's an inside story from back in the day. A more approriate title would be ""Cream As Remembered by People Who Were or Were Not There."" The focus is on these people rather than the music or the musicians."
1,Don't waste your money,"The only redeeming factor for this DVD was a chance to hear commentary by Pete Brown. One hour of people babbling about Cream interspersed with the same old tired clips we have been seeing for decades (nothing new here)was a true dissappointment. I also can't figure out why ""journalist"" Steve Rosen was allowed on this DVD due to his Clapton bashing. What a complete twit. Another thing regarding the film clips was why does the camera only appear to focus on their faces and not how they are playing their instruments? This DVD will serve me well into the future as a coffee table coaster."
1,Trash. Exploitative Trash.,"You want to know why I hate most rock critics? Buy this DVD and you'll understand my state of mind. This DVD consists almost entirely of clueless, jealous, failed musicians taking cheap shots at one of the finest rock bands ever. So why does this DVD exist then? The money, of course. Yeah, Pete Brown's on it, but so what? His total screen time is about 10-15 minutes or something...I don't know the exact amount of time because I could never finish the ""film.""I got milked out of 15 dollars for this and though I was thinking of returning it for a refund, I figured that other people shouldn't catch a glimpse of this. I was also thinking about using the DVD as a coaster for wine and cheese parties, but the condensation tends to creep through that little hole in the center so that option was out. So I just threw it away. Let's put it this way: Steve Rosen should be glad that I don't know where he lives."
4,So far so good . . .,I've only used the roaster for one turkey - so far. It cooked in the exact time it was supposed to. The turkey turned out tender and juicy and cleanup was easy. My oven was free to cook all the other side dishes and everything was done at the same time for a change. I'm looking forward to trying the roaster out with soup and stew for all the family over the Christmas holidays.
5,Nesco Roaster Oven,"Purchased the Nesco 18 Quart Roaster Oven with Stainless Steel Cookwell. Despite noting a couple of disparaging reviews from others (who may have failed to follow the instructions for properly heating the cookwell prior to the first use), I found this product to be excellent. I have use it several times to prepare holiday meals for up to 24 family members and a number of other large gathering. Consider the optional stainless side dish warming pans, which make it far more versatile for serving as well, and add only a few dollars to your purchase."
1,As good as it looks NO DURABILITY,"UPDATE: After two years and maybe 4 uses, it bit the dust. I put a turkey in it and went back to sleep only to find in the morning that it failed completely. Dead without warning! I'm not pleased at all. I recommend selecting something else.Don't worry about the burn out. Yes it smokes and it's very pungent (do it outside or in your garage) but it's only one day in the probable very long life of this roaster. The high quality is hard to miss when you examine it. The stainless steel says a lot, but it's sturdy too and I noticed it's even insulated which I didn't expect. If you value quality like I do, I doubt you'll be disappointed."
5,A MUST-READ FOR A SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE,"This is the best book I've ever read on the subject of relationship. It is a marriage-saver and unearths what goes wrong with so many marriages. As a spiritual counselor, I recommend it to all of my clients. This book will change your life in a major, wonderful way. Can't say enough good things about it!!"
3,funny but the worst of her dvd's,"I love Lisa Lampanelli and was so looking forward to another stand up from her. But for the first time I was disappointed. Some funny lines but a lot of it seemed tired, and way too much on her husbands big balls. I will check her out in the future, she is a very funny & quick."
2,Lowered Expectations,"I love this woman's work - she's incredibly warm and funny, and manages to really get us for the shock value - but I think the dramatic difference in delivery technique that stands between a roast and general stand-up is what manages to not only elude her, but also kill her performance.The show tended to drag on, and the material wasn't fresh - it was rehashed and not very funny. How long is she going to talk about the size of her new husband's testicles?She always insults the audience to laughs, but this time her insults were predictable and ho-hum... and many aspects of her approach to this show made it an overall lackluster performance. In fact, it wasn't until 50 minutes into the show, during which she actually did her own little roast that I actually found it hilarious. Ironically, she was reading from a script.I hope she gets it together, or just realizes what her limitations are as a comedienne. I look forward to her next roast."
4,Politically Wrong - but so right.,Awesome comedian - I've been a fan for years. Can't wait for the next dvd or seeing her in person. Lisa Lampanelli is a true comedian who makes fun of everyone. I would not recommend this to anyone who can't take racial jokes.
4,I like Lisa Lampanelli,I understand Lisa Lampanelli is not for everyone and Definitely NOT for kids but her style of comedy is priceless.
1,Tired and Lame!!! Lisa has lost here comedic charm.,The ethnic jokes are tired. They're not even funny.The first 15 minutes were okay. Afterwards it went downhill.jokes about her husbands balls went on and on and weren't funny to begin with.I wouldn't even recommend watching this on netflix as that too would even then be a waste of time and money.
1,False advertising,This product was listed with the edition that has a 2002 publication date. The product I received was published in 1977. Considering I paid a little less than $4 for this it makes no sense to waste an envelope and time returning it but it is disappointing that such misinformation is practiced.
1,Missing 33 pages from the Second Half,"This is a very interesting work, but with one major flaw: a printing error. The second half of the book, ""My Fall"", ascends in pages up to page 148 where, on the following page drops back to page 117 and then reprints everything between 117 and 148, then picks up at page 181 skipping everything between page 148 and page 181 altogether. This is significant because it covers the portion directly following Mussolini's rescue by the Germans.It is important to know there will be a big gap in the book if you buy this version. LOOK FOR ANOTHER VERSION THAT INCLUDES THE WHOLE BOOK!"
3,Intricate display of unanticipated consequences,"This French film with English subtitles graphically tells the tale of the consequences of what is originally a ""white lie"" by the emotionally detached heroine that initiates a series of events that end in tragedy when the heroine becomes emotionally committed to her lover and loses him by evading total truthfullnes. A ruby solitaire film in the genre of Arthur Schnitzler."
3,Could be better...,"The images of this adult coloring book were of extreme variation of quality and detail. I preferred the detailed images and found some useful for my own artwork; however, most left me with a boring feeling. I definitely prefer the Egyptian Designs Coloring Book that is available, especially since the images in this book are back-to-back, unlike the Egyptian one. Yet there are more images available in the African book, so that is why I gave it 3 stars instead of two...and I have enjoyed the few that I have colored with colored pencils."
2,Flush!,"I wanted to like this cd so badly. I gave this several listens and still could not begin to even start tolerating this release. I liked Manic Expressive, I even liked the Young Machines but this one was a bit of a stretch. His lyrics are garbage, don't kid yourself otherwise, I overlooked it in Young Machines but this is inexcusable. Someone needs to tell Marc to stop writing about the pains of being a musician because its not relatable, and quite frankly if you can't handle the criticism stop putting out records."
1,Very Misleading!,"though it was the album mentioned, it was not in fact VINYL as advertised! The fact that is was labled as the Vinyl issue of this album is why i bought it in the first place & it turned out to be a lie. This actually makes me very weary about ordering from Amazon. The seller should have not made this claim if it were not true. Very bad review for this seller..."
2,Change the channel,"Channel Live - Station Identification (Capitol, 1995)These guys are one-hit wonders. ""Mad Izm"" is the only track that's worth bangin'. ""Reprogram"" is pretty cool also. Everything else is mediocre. The beats are on point though, provided by KRS-One, Salaam Remi, and others. -EJR"
2,It's okay..,"I drive a minivan, so I wanted this for the extra large size. Well, it's big enough, but it's real floppy and thin, so it doesn't stay in place. When I put the driver & passenger visors down to hold it in place, it still slides all around behind it. You kind of have to get it in just the right place and hope it stays. But hey, what do you want for $5 bucks?? As far as blocking the sun, it seems to help, but I live in Florida and there's really no way around the heat."
4,Wonderful Math Rock,"With this and their debut s/t album, Hal Al prove themselves to be on the level of math rockers of the past, Polvo, June of 44, etc... Songs are as melodic, well-written, and performed as any of their predecessors, but of course, they not just faceless imitators saying: hey, lets write some math rock. It flows from them so naturally, it couldn't be anything else besides: Hal Al Shedad. While pretty similar stylistically to their debut, there is a small progression in maturity. But I couldn't recommend one over the other, so I recommend both."
4,Cheap but efficient needles.,"I think the needles are fair considering the price.A pack of 100 needles would cost around $12 retail at Wally World.The only thing that concerned me over these was that they were packaged in a zip lock bag. So they weren't ""sealed"" to ensure they are sterile and that worried me a little bit. But each lancet does have it's own twisty head cap so that helps put me at ease a bit. I gave it four stars for that reason and b/c the caps don't twist off as easily as the more pricier lancets and you sometimes bend the needle trying to get the cap off.I have a contour meter and it fit it just fine."
2,Book,"Nothing bad about the people I worked with in getting this book, but it is so dry in so many parts that if you need a good book to put you to sleep this is the one. The chapters are huge and seem to go on and on and say the same things over and over."
4,Very Comfortable Imported shoe,"Nice feel, comfortable walkers, oxfords. Good for Business Casual to Jeans. Very nice build quality, leather lined. Shoes do not breathe real well, and get a little sweaty. Tongue tends to slide off to one side. Should have loop on tongue to anchor to laces to correct problem. Buy this shoe on sale, do not pay full price of $130.00 as other web stores charge. I bought mine on Amazon for better than 1/2 that price."
2,3 pack is half the fun,"This game is not easy to manuever. The pool game is difficult to operate and not very fun. the dart game is not bad once you get the hang of it. The bowling game is not very versatile when it comes to throwing the ball, but there are a lot of options for the player and the ball styling. I have tried the Sierra attractions pool demo, and that one was a lot easier to operate, I should have bought that one."
3,This game has very few good things.,"I got this game thinking, ""Cool. Bowling, Darts and Pool."" Lemme tell you guys something. I was hooked to darts and pool. Nonstop action, and even practice modes, easy controls and better than average graphics. So, this is where you say, ""Why only three stars, person who wrote this review?"" Because the bowling game is not even mediocre. Heck, there's not even a word for it! I found the controls sluggish, the loading time was terrible and the graphics looked like they were programmed by amoebas. Save your hard drive and don't install the bowling. It just isn't worth it. I must say, the price just about covers the fun in darts and pool."
4,Insight into the Imam of Arabic Grammar,"The Author has done a good job of bringing to light the life of one of the earliest grammarians of Arabic Language. Overall, the book is a good read, although a reader who does not have some background in Arabic Grammar will feel lost after the first few terms. This book is also a very good primer for anyone who wants to delve into the intricacies of Sibawayhi's Al-Kitab since the author has very diligently described various chapters/parts of Al-Kitab and how the work helped in the growth of a nascent Arabic grammar.All in all, a work well done."
5,great gate,This is the best gate I ever bought. It operates smoothly and seems very sturdy. The only problem wasThe directions did not go with the parts. The latch that came with the gate wasn't anythinglike the direction. I ended not using the latch.
4,Item as described,The measurement is accurate; product as described.Easy to install.Came in a secured package.Good quality.Overall: A happy purchase!
3,"Easy to install, hard to operate","I agree that it's easy to install this gate. I bought the original, plus the 10-inch extension to fit the stairway on my deck (stop my toddlers falling down the 5 steps to the yard below).I'm sorry, I just don't see how this could be easy for anyone to open. I understand how the mechanism is supposed to work (pinch the little tabs together, and lift). I don't know whether my particular unit had a thicker-than-usual coat of paint that makes it all a lot stiffer to operate than it needs to be. I can definitely say that tabs you pinch with your fingers could be bigger.Overall, the whole thing is too stiff to operate with one hand. I'm keeping it because I typically only need to shut it while the kids are out on the deck, then leave it open the rest of the time, and it's hard to find an operable gate in this width (53"")."
3,aLAS this BOOK is DRY as DUST,"I actually learned from this book -- in particular, gained an understanding of relative stress and of how the best free verse incorporates meter -- but Pinsky, though he has the love, is dry as can be, bless him."
2,"Pinksy is dry, dull, and overrated","Much praise has been heaped upon this little book, and I would like to say that, in my experience, it doesn't hold up. Pinsky's prose, much as his poetry, is dry and preachy; you can tell there's something there behind it, some honest impulse, but the man is unwilling to let it loose. Many treat ""The Sounds of Poetry"" as if it were the first of its kind, which is rediculous, or the first to cut to the chase and do away with technicalities in favor of the true nitty-gritty, which is even more rediculous. Pinksy his a hyperdull prosodist."
1,Not Beneficial,"I purchased this book because of my interest in metric poetry but to my disappointment I learned almost nothing from the book. If you want to read a good 5-star book on the subject then I suggest ""A Poem's Heartbeat"" by Alfred Corn."
5,Excellent introduction,"Robert Pinsky's The Sounds of Poetry is an invaluable guide to the most critical--and one of the most neglected--aspects of poetic writing: sound. I first read this book when taking an undergrad poetry-writing course, and I found it immensely helpful.Pinsky takes a great deal of potentially clunky, academic information and distills it into a fast, easily-digestible handbook. In just over 100 pages, he outlines the essentials of rhythm, meter, the meaning carried by sounds, and the interrelation of all three. For anyone who has read, studied, or written poetry before, there won't be much new here, but having so much good advice in such a concentrated form makes this little book an excellent read. Even several years after taking that course, I still find myself browsing this book, looking for helpful reminders and inspiration.Pinsky's book is not only helpful and informative, it's a fast, fun read--it both delights and informs. Horace would be proud.Highly recommended."
5,Pinsky's book broadens understanding of language,"Robert Pinsky's book ""The Sound of Poetry"" emphasizes the formal elements of poetry. His exploration of poetry centers on the premise that poetry is a musical art form that harmonizes the audible elements. Pinksy lucidly illumines the everyday reader into the mystery of verse. His careful analysis of poetic structure and rhythms get at what the core of a great poem is. While in this attempt he sometimes tries to phrase the inexpressible he still manages to make the reader understand his point. The inexactness of language which sometimes fails in prose, becomes the same basis for beautiful poetry.While aimed more precisley at young poets, any english speaker who has the patience to stick with this worthy tome can gain an increased understanding of the nature of the language that can only expand and inform his or her own poetry and prose and broaden the richness of his or her life experience."
4,80's humor,Good little 80's sequel to Meatballs (although I really wouldn't call it a sequel)! Fun movie with lots of laughs and even an alien!
4,Good presentation of the governing equations,"This book contains usefull descriptions of the governing equations for the fluid flow in porous medium, especially chapter 1 (written by Whitaker). This chapter presents the complete derivation of the equations based on the volume average procedure. The others chapters are not so good, but also present some usefull information for researchers interested in modelling porous media flows. Particularly the last chapter, which presents a comprehensive review on numerical methods for porous media. Overall, it is possible to say that it is a good book, and if you are interested in modelling porous media flows it is worth to buy it."
2,Deceptive Picture,"The shoe rack works fine, but the picture put up is very deceptive. It only comes with ONE shelf, and the picture shows two stacked together. I have no idea what a person would want with one shelf since half your shoes would be on the floor anyway, so whats the point?? Way too expensive for one shelf. Returning this!"
1,False advertising with the image,From the picture I expected the mesh to have 2 tiers where I could put shoes on them. Instead it was just one. I am very unhappy with this and have to now purchase another one to have a second tier.
3,"Is only one shelf, now two","Picture shows two shelfs, making three levels for shoes. When I opened it, it was only one shelf, so only two levels for shoes. Otherwise, serves its purpose well."
1,Looks may be deceiving,This item is not worth the money since the picture gave the impression that it was a dual shelved product. This is the first time I buy something on here and am not satisfied with the product due to price vs worth.
3,Great shelf. Emphasis on single shelf.,"I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before I purchased this item. I purchased it based on the photo, which clearly shows TWO shelves stacked together. As the price was comparable to other shoe racks with two shelves, I had no idea that this was for a single shelf. I give it a 3 star rating because we're going to keep it. My daughter loves it, it works well for her dress-up shoes, with ample space underneath for her real shoes (the shoes are directly on the carpet, though, which defeats the purpose of a shoe rack). Had I been on top of things and read the reviews, I would not have purchased this product, because we wanted a shoe rack with two shelves and there are other shoe racks with two and three shelves available on Amazon for the same price."
5,"Easy, versatile, sturdy","These are super easy to stack and very versatile. Unlike other shelves which only work for shoes of a certain length or size or require you to precariously balance you shoes on them, this allows you to toss shoes in, or use shoeboxes, or use as a shelf for other things besides shoes. The mesh design helps you see your shoes on the lower levels too. Also infinitely stackable unlike other designs."
5,Easy to Use,I love this shoe rack. To assemble the rack was easy (just pop out the side). The racks are easily stackable. I could fit 3 pairs of women's shoes on one level or 2 pairs of men's + stacked flip flops on one level. I purchased a total of 4 and have room for more when I need it. The cheap metal/plastic racks are no comparison to this!
2,"Misleading ad, obstinate reviews","I purchased this shoe rack last week, thinking that $20 was a good deal for a 2 tiered, mesh shoe rack. When the rack arrived, it was only half of what is pictured on the seller's page. Other reviewers, who are apparently just argumentative, or who are related to the seller, suggest ""reading the details or reviews would have shown me what the product actually was"", but thats not acceptable to me even *if* the accurate details really were printed in that section. The image shown is that of a TWO TIERED SHOE RACK. Either modify this picture to show whats actually being sold, or perhaps enough crappy reviews and equally crappy sales will remind the seller of what integrity is all about. Yes, the DIMENSIONS listed of this rack are those of a single tier, but Im not in the habit of corroborating printed measurements with what appears in printed images of the products Im about to buy."
3,Stackable? Not without cable ties,"This item was a good solution to our small hallway closet. It is however not as stackable as the ad says. But with a little help from cable ties we got it to work. It will also only hold two and a half pairs of adult shoes, not 3."
5,The Single Best Monk Performance,"There are a lot of Monk CDs out there repeating parts of themselves. If you wanted ONE recording that illustrates Monk's genius, his better work from his better days, and which showcases other artists-- proving that Monk stood with and above his peers-- this is the CD to buy. Also, it has good cover notes which put Thelonious Monk in some historical perspective. (These notes caused me to want to learn more, which led me to Robin D. G. Kelley's biography, ""Thelonious Monk: The Life and Times of an American Original""). In short, it's a good Monk primer and is a good addition to any collection if you don't buy another Monk CD. I've given it as a gift to people who have never listened to Monk, in hopes the big band context will get them interested in a little more, so maybe they'll enjoy pure solo Monk someday."
1,JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,We ordered three of these jump ropes and they ALL broke after two days. They cannot be fixed so we threw them away!THEY ARE JUNK!!!!!!!!!
5,Great Chew Toy,"As a certified dog trainer I've been using Kongs for several years. These are great to fill with a treat (frozen peanut butter is my favorite)and give your puppy/dog as you put them in their crates. Buy the black heavy duty Kongs for very strong chewers, but the red ones work great for most dogs. Kongs are very well made and should last a long time. Buy a few, they usually end up in places hard to find so having extra ones is a plus."
1,Rip off!!!,"I ordered these to help organize & make space. Not only are these not durable, they will begin to re-inflate within a day if not within an hour. I spent HOURS getting everything into them (all different sizes) & had everything nice & neat, did everything I was supposed to & they ended up ruining the shelves they were placed into because they expanded. They are NOT re-usable & they tear very easily. I spent a lot of $ on these since I ordered several sets & now they are completely useless. A plastic trash bag will do the same thing unfortunately for a fraction of the cost."
1,Not quite as advertised.,"If you want to save space using space bags, you may or may not. I guess it really depends on the lot you get. Sometimes, no matter what you do, the air leaks out. Sometimes, not. Don't waste your money trying to find that one perfect bag."
1,Poor,"These never stay airtight. When air enters, they expand in size. Completely defeats the purpose, and main selling, point of the bags."
1,Space Bages Do Not Work,I purchased space bags to travel to Florida and 3 days later when I arrived all the seals had released. The zipper seal does not work. I even tried closing the bag with my fingers like a zip lock baggie and they still didn't work. I would never buy these bags again or suggest anyone else buy them.
1,Rips IMMEDIATELY!,"I was thrilled about trying these out. I opened it up, carefully loaded it with linens, and tried very carefully to follow directions. But I couldn't get the air sucked out. Then I noticed: gigantic rip in the bottom. When and how that happened, I have no idea. Cheap materials. I do not recommend!!"
1,Forget it!,"Gee...I've been thinking, ""what kind of idiot must I be that I can't get these to work,"" then I read some reviews... We had mice get in our house, and I had to clean every dang drawer and shelf in the house. (They were coming in under the dishwasher - make sure the connections to yours are sealed properly...). I bought about 30 space bags to ""plasticize"" everything I had in storage. Only 3 of the bags held the seal and remained airtight. Fortunately, I have the space to use the bags anyway, but I sure wish they would stay compacted. Another product that is a good idea but is cheaply executed. I would be happy to spend much more for a product that works the way this is advertised. In future, I will use garbage bags with air removed, as some reviewers have suggested. As these bags are currently made, they are not worth the money."
1,Minus 10 If possible! Horrible waste of money!,I was moving across country. Bought these for saving space.... as advertised. They are horrible! Out of about 40... not even 10 stayed vaccuum sealed for longer than 2 days! I did them over and over and over. They tore VERY easily. After 2 weeks I got moved and the large bags were sooo brittle already that the tops ripped right off instead of pulling open! DO NOT waste your money on this garbage like I did! You've been warned!
2,Poor quality,"The bags are very easy to rip, so you have to be very careful opening and closing the bags. I do not recommend this product"
1,Product does not work well,"I had high hopes for these space bags. I bought several in advance of our cross-country move. I think two of them worked, as in, stayed sealed and compressed. The rest would not stay sealed, no matter what we did. I would not buy these again. I wish I had saved the money."
1,poor quality,"I bought a set of Space Bags after watching a commercial on TV. The concept is great, but the design of the bags are terrible! The ""zipper"" does not zip and it rips the plastic as it goes over it. I was able to close the zipper with my fingers, but it was quite a project. Attach the vacuum and it does shrink the bag and contents to a very thin, easily storable size, but as soon as you put the stopper on the bag starts to leak and fill back up again. This is okay if you vacuum, put the stopper in and IMMEDIATELY put the bag where you plan on storing it. If you want to store several bags on top of one another you need to work FAST to get them all in there before the inflate again. When removing the contents from one of them the seam on the side split.The advertisement states that it keeps your clean clothes smelling fresh - this is not true - everything need to be re-washed before wearing."
2,Doesn't stay compressed,"I've purchased Space Saver bags several times. They are great at first, but I'm finding when the items are stored, after a period of time they are no longer air tight. I even double wrapped a few items in an inner Space Saver bag and an outer Space Saver bag and still they did not remain air tight. These bags are expensive. I'm disappointed."
4,The Bird and the Bee is Buzzing with Tropical Excitement,"Basia meets Sergio Mendes. That's how this cd sounds to me. It is brimming with tropical flavor. It's the kind of music you would expect to hear on the streets in Rio. Great songs and interesting chord changes. The only downside to the cd is one smutty song (""My F*en Boyfriend"".)Other than that,I recommend this cd to anyone who likes Sergio,Basia,Shakatak, The Carnival, Sandy Valentino,etc."
4,Back to the 60's,"Wow, what can I say, other than I felt like I was transported back to the late 60's. Only thing missing was Goldie Hawn and the Laugh-In gang dancing to the music. Just when I thought music had become predictable, this comes along and reminds us that maybe we should look back for inspiration instead of pumping out the same stuff we have been for almost a decade now! I look forward to hearing more from The Bird and The Bee!"
4,Headphones heaven,THOSE LOOKING FOR BACKGROUND MUSIC MUST NOT BUY THIS!This stops you in your tracks and compels you to do nothing but listen.A rare occurence these days.I wasn't at all surprised.Inara's solo album 'All Rise' was a delightful thing to discover a few years ago.The Bird And The Bee is even further out on a limb.Listen loud on headphones for sheer heaven experience.
4,"Fun, relaxing, different",I bought this after hearing it on NPR. Warning don't try and listen while in a rush...you won't get much done. :)
3,"Great writing, dissapointing album","While both the lyric and melodic writing is outstanding for the most part, the production and mixing on this album pretty much ruins it. Inara's voice is cloudy and muddy on most of the tracks, and in general everything kinda mushes together with very little clarity. There's 1 or 2 standout tracks, the rest is pretty much unlistenable. I would love to hear this album re-mixed by a better engineer though."
5,Wonderful and Wonderfully Fun,"I've meant to say this since the release party but you must, must, must pick this up now along with Inara's solo cd for music you're going to come back to again and again and tell your friends about. It's not the best music ever made but it's music that'll stay with you and just about everyone you play it for will enjoy....this isn't very critical but I hope it encourages you to give it a try! And if you've got a chance to catch them live Don't Miss Out!"
4,Looking for this. You can get this on DVD...,"If like me you are looking for this, then wait no longer. I have just imported mine from Germany for less than 15 Euros (and in 5 days). In Germany the title has changed and you should be looking for 'TOD in den AUGEN'. The original english sound track is on there. As for the film its alright, but it is starting to show its age, CF is great as always."
4,Claire Forlani is spectacular!!!!,"This is an exciting movie. I urge all purchase this title, Claire Forlani plays her character well. A must see for Forlani fans."
2,Too buggy!!!!! My expectations were too high!!!,"I bought this software program because I thought it would be good to use to make fliers, brochures, and stuff for the real estate business. I was impressed with the review and the product information. But when I recieved the software and tried to use it, i couldn't get the projects to work. I was only able to view the different pictures that were on my computer.I think that I am going to try PrintShop Deluxe instead. I heard and read that that Adobe PhotoShop is the big daddy to this -- Adobe PhotoDeluxe, but I can't afford that right now. I think that the Adobe PhotoDeluxe BE 1.0 needs some improvement. But I do love Adobe products."
2,"Easy to use, but one fatal flaw","The product does not allow you to save a file as JPEG. This has caused me many problems with posting photos to my Web page. Otherwise, the product is easy to use and has lots of fun things to create."
2,Looks Rugged but isn't,This level looks awesome. It even feels awesome. Subject it to moderate abuse and it comes apart. This is the second one that has done this to me. The first one had the magnets fall out for no reason. There won't be a third opportunity. Skip it.
3,Stabila Knockoff,"Yep, this little level has it all; the classic yellow paint job, clear acrylic vials, unique comfortable shape, built in magnets. About the only thing the chinese couldn't capture in their mold is the ""Stabila"" brand.If you don't like the Swanson name on this one you can go down to the local discount store and buy the same knockoff with the ""Mayes"" decal on it at an even lower price."
5,"Such a heart-wrenching, touching story","I sat down this morning to read this book and would not put it down until I found out how Remy got through her surgery. As a mother, this is my biggest fear - that one of my children become seriously ill. Heather's story helped me rediscover myself, and some of my faith! Thank you for telling us your story!"
4,Simply Enlightening,"This book is for all thoes who suffer from fear and anxiety. Who does that leave out? On Fear, is a collection of Krishnamurti's very profound observations and thoughts on how our society engenders fear with the competitive education we recieve and with our ambitious approach to life. He also points out that a mind that is afraid, cannot know peace or love. Krishnamurti suggests that only a fundamental realization of the root of all fear can free our minds. For thoes people seeking a deeper understanding into the psychology of fear, its contributing societal factors and how to deal with it, this book is very enlightening."
2,A book about conquering fear???,"I expected this to help me out with my fears that I've had in my life for a long time but it did just the opposite to me. Instead of helping me conquer my fears it helped me lose hope and faith in myself because it goes against everything I believe in.I believe in God and the author says that religion is basically a scapegoat. Granted, after page 150 I quit reading the book. It's been over a month since I've read the book, and I just finished STOP WORRYING AND START LIVING by Dale Carenigie -- still a great timeless classic."
4,Not bad,"After performing well in an AP US history class last year, I was skeptic about my performance on the subject test, fearing that I had forgotten a lot of material. However, this book was of great help. The review section isn't very detailed, so it may be helpful to use this book with another review book (such as one for AP US history). But the practice tests are fantastic. Quite a few of the Kaplan questions appeared on the SAT subject test I took. I ended up with a 700."
2,"Only if you are a doctor or medical student, then buy this","This book looked wonderful until I actually received it and started reading it. It was a book written for doctors by doctors. What a disappointment, especially since I am a registered nurse with minimal ICU skills, and was looking for this book under NURSING references. If you are a medical student, I highly recommend it, but otherwise, save your money!!"
2,cd,Not real impressed with the cd. Looking for the OLD copy of the dennis the menace record they had WAY back in the day. This is nothing like it.
4,Irritating for adults; great for kids,"I had this album when it first came out as an LP. I listened to it constantly, particularly the ""I Hate Liver"" song, which my older sister appropriated, changing all the lyrics to her new version, ""I Hate Ironing"". Oddly enough, the record sort of disappeared one day, and neither of my parents could seem to find time to look for it...Today, of course, I listen to it as an adult, and being the rebellious sort of person I am, I still appreciate it quite a lot. Parents beware!"
5,Great for reminiscing!,"This was really thought provoking and brought back many memories. That era is gone forever but we will always have our memories!If you read this book you will have to read ""Leap"" also."
1,can you say 'self-absorbed'?,"This book confirms every single Boomer stereotype. Are these women nice or thoughtful? Not much. Do they have anything interesting to say? No. I wanted to smack Sara Davidson after reading this, but instead I will just be grateful that I am not her child or friend."
3,College life in the 60's - read what you missed,"This book is about 3 sorority girls from Berkeley in the 60s. But they are not 3 typical girls. If you were in college in the 60's as I was (I was at Cal Berkeley from 1963 to 1996) and you want to know hat you missed, read this book. There is more free love, far east religion, and politically radical behavior in this book than I saw in Berkeley and ever after. The book is well written. If you are a man, you will find that differences in sexual attitude beweeen men and women of that time are brought into specific relief. One more thing, read the book one person at a time instead of in the sequence presented. I liked it. I recommend it."
1,"Great light for awhile! Then, dim as the moon. Now? Nothing.","Not sure what happened. The light was very bright for about a year or so, then just went dim. Now? Nothing. This was with household use from my mom.* Tried brand new batteries (1.57V+ each cell),* Tried cleaning the front contact for the battery with an eraser (as suggested by Maglite).No help.The remedy from Maglite is to ship it to Canada insured, cost around $15~$20. But there are alternatives. Cost of nice Coleman flashlight? $20.Unfortunately, Maglite kind of lost a customer.[...]"
3,Not quite what I was looking for.,"I love the story and it's my friend's favorite book. I was hunting for a gift for her that she'd like and ran into the cover of this thing wich is probably half of what drove you to buying it as well. After I bought it, I discovered that it only has seventeen pages. (The Original Book as like 47) And despite what the cover would suggest, some of the illustration is a bit .. ""crappy"". I'm not trying to be a tough critic. The story goes along just fine untill the fairy gets into the picture she looks like a goldenbooks gingerbread-man and the diologue drops flat right there and I could almost see a big red ""ADAPTATION"" stamp across the page. If you want to read your kids or significant others ""processed classics"", then this is right up your alley. Enjoy."
5,breathtaking illustration,"I've always been fond of this tale, since a university lecturer read the entire story to our psychology classes in human development many years ago. The original illustrations are wonderful, of course, but when I read this copy of the book to my 4 year old daughter, she gasped with wonder when we turned the page to reveal the drawing of the fairy. For a young child, I believe these glowing illustrations enhance the empathy the child feels for the rabbit in his journey towards becoming real."
5,the veleteen rabbit,"this was my favorite book as a child. i read it to my grandkids, read it to my kids, too. i still own my original copy from the early 1960's. it's a great story about how illness can become a happy thing."
4,good bio,"Thoroughly detailed, if not downright exhaustive bio of Shelley and Byron. While I would have preferred less attention to descriptions of seemingly every single sexual encounter both men had, the literary journeys and what experiences shaped their adult philosophies is fascinating. There is an in-depth focus on the poets' relationships to their families, and how the attitudes shaped their shows up in their work. Recommended."
5,"cats say ""far out ""","It says organic , but even compared to the regular , (which all my cats have always preferred) this stuff brings out the beast like it's laced with PCB . Not always available , try some and you'll find yourself rationing it for special occasions ."
4,CD Purchase,I received the item on time. The package was in great conition and I really enjoyed the CD. My expectations were met.
4,African Cry,"I spent a semester at Africa University in Zimbabwe studying African Theology. Out of all of the theologians that I was exposed to on the continent of Africa, I found Ela most helpful. IF I could read French, I would have read much more of his work. Jean-Marc Ela is the finest example of liberation theology on the African continent, outside of South Africa."
3,Not really 20 Useful Ft,"This is not something i would buy if your are expecting 20 useful feet of cord. Perhaps you might see 8-10 feet at best. It is also not very heavy wire and insulation. You will be better off going to some place like Radio Shack and putting an eyeball to this kind of product. I use it for my guitar amp. and headphone useage and it works just ""OK"" with a noticable hum in my ears when not playing the shielding is non-existant but I get past it and get my guitar practice sessions in without driving my wife nutty."
3,MaxellHP-20 Headphone extension cord.,"The headphone extension works fine but is a bit short for my use, it could have been 5 feet longer"
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this extension cable for my husband to be able to plug into his computer in his office so he could walk around with his headphones on. The cable made the sound quality HORRIBLE!! You could hear the instrument portion of any music or video you played, but the vocals sounded like they were in a cave. We tried this with his ipod, music on the hard drive, videos on the hard drive, and youtube. Same results from all. I finally bought him a 10 ft cable from Monoprice for almost the same price as this one."
3,Smells horrible but sounds fine,"It would receive 5 stars except for the smell, which is literally putrid. Airing it out with it slightly stretched to expose the entire coil to air has helped some."
1,Believe the one-star reviews and buy something else,"Received this extension cord and started using it today. Already the contact to the earbuds has broken. And no, I was not rough with it. Like someone else said, it has to be hooked up just right to make contact - which in my case means it's most of the way out and will have to be reinforced with electrical tape to keep it in just the right place. I'd send it back, but it's not worth sinking more money into the shipping cost.Doesn't anyone make a quality product anymore??? So frustrating."
2,Extension cord is terrible,"Bought it for the extension cord, adapters were just a bonus. Adapters seem to work fine but the extension cord is terrible, absolutely kills audio volume and quality. You can turn it up but the audio quality SUCKS; all the depth is gone, especially the bass. The difference is night and day with the extension installed."
4,Almost perfect,"Hey, it's long and it's cheap, and it works. It would be nice to have gold plated contacts but if I get a few years out of it before it gets scratchy, it was worth the price."
4,The cord is perfect!,"I have not used any of the adapters, but I bought this item for the cord anyhow. It works very well for stretching all the way across the room so that I can listen to the TV while I workout on my elliptical. No problems."
2,False Advertisment,"Unstretched, the cord is literally 5 feet long. I bought it for my headphones, my t.v. is about 10 feet away. I need to stretch the cord a lot just so it works. At least the adapters are cool."
3,It works for its intended purpose,"I haven't really had any functional problems with this extension cord. It works as intented, but it gets tangled easily and it immediatly reduces that distance unless it's untangled."
5,LIke this set a lot,"This has handy little things you always need from time to time. The coiled headphone extension is a neat, compact item. Like it better than the straight ones. Not so messy."
1,Defective,Mine came with the length of cord attached to each earbud completely uneven so that it wasn't usable. I returned for a refund and elected not to get a replacement.
1,Connection breaking after less than six months,"I bought this for the extension cable less than 6 months ago, and it's already deteriorating. Specifically, I need to make sure the cable is in exactly the right position for the audio to go through.The fact that this happened so quickly screams low quality manufacturing to me. I'm looking elsewhere in the future."
2,Disappointed!,"I bought this extension to fit my Bose headphones I use with my desktop because the regular extension was thin and chewed up by my cat.I thought the spiraling part would not clutter my desk that much, and it would discourage my cat from chewing. Well, I am sad to say, after only a couple of weeks, I had to throw this one in the trash. First of all, the spiraling part makes the extension twist just as the old phone cords used to do. Very annoying, but, ok, I could live with that. Today, however, the plug just broke off! I had to do some serious digging into the back of my MAC to get the broken piece out of the earphone connection !! Not a solid product. Don't buy."
1,Terrible Sound Quality,"Maybe it was the set I received but I got nothing but static & crackle from my headphones plugged into a receiver with these. As others have said, the adapters work great but the extension cord itself is the factor. Your mileage may vary!"
3,Coiled extensions versus straight corded ones,"Purchased this item in Oct. 2012.It bears repeating that a coiled extension cord acts differently than a straight one when in use even if both cords are rated at 20 feet long.I needed a 15 ft. length and bought this thinking I would have extra unneeded length. Yes, it does stretch to 20ft, but all coiled extension cords will pull or tug toward whatever they are plugged into after you stretch them about half way or 10ft. in this case. It is uncomfortable for the user after 10 feet because the cord is literally snapping back toward the receiver or whatever it is plugged into.The user feels like you have to constantly be pulling the cord toward yourself to ease up on the tension where the cord fits into your headphones.To use these comfortably buy double the length your need required. ie Buy 20ft if your headphones are only 10 feet away."
3,It is ok,It got the job dune but in mine it had a connection issue it had a slite break in the cable. It also came with an airplane adapter witch was a plus
1,Cord Socket has problems,"When I first plug my 1/8"" headphone male connector into this cord's female socket, there is terrible distortion. I found that the socket allows the headphone connector to insert a fraction of an inch too far. If I carefully extract the connector a tiny bit then I get great, clear sound, but it is too precarious to remain this way. One slight bump and it moves and is distorted again. I am going to try to get a replacement and see if it is better."
4,useful,very good product i will buy more .It was a very useful product that like and will tell my friends.
2,did not work for me,"when I plug the extension cord in my computer it does not transmit the sound correctly, somehow spoken words always come through lower than the music. it is really bad to listen to..."
5,On time and what I expected,"It is working. It got here on time. The coils, um, coil.I don't have high expectations for headphone extensions. They break. Especially when I put my foot on them while seated and stand up. Or shut them in doors. Or yank them out by the cord. Or leave them on the dash when it's 110 degrees in Houston.I want to get this off my review list, so I won't wait for it to break so I can tell you how long it lasted."
3,Kinda cheesy,It's ok.it works.kinda cheesy. But it was cheap so I really shouldn't complain. Doesn't match up to my really good headset
4,Works great!,"It gave me the extra length I needed and it has several sizes of adapters which, while I haven't used them, will probably come in handy in the future."
5,maxell hp-20 headphone extension cord with adapters,i purchased this to go with the headphones i purchased and it was just exactly what i was looking for. the length of the cord allows me the freedom to move around the room and not get tangled up in it. i can use it on all appliances in my home so portibility is great. the price was amazing. just what i could afford. i trust maxell to make quality products.
4,Great Extension,"When I first got it and felt how light, I thought to myself it ""would not hold up."" I wore it for the first time while exercising on my home gym; long enough, good stretching and recoil, stayed out of the way. After two hours of using it, ""I LIKE IT!"" This will definitely suit my intended purposes, listening to music or watching movies in bed at night. Rules here is `no noise and must wear headphones at all times'. No problem now, with this extension, reaches to the ends of my room and even onto the bed with the earbuds on. Great feel and no sound reduction. Only thing I did not like is that the volume adjustment didn't work on my Apple earbuds, no loss tho'."
1,"Bad coffee, excess repair costs",would not recommend this coffee maker. The coffee is only so-so..temperature is lukewarm after a few months and there is a washer in the tank that has to be replaced every few months at $2.50 a pop plus shipping and handling.
5,Great coffee for several years,"I'm looking to buy my second BrewStation. I got one of these as a gift several years ago. After constant hard use, the on button has become unreliable. I have never had any problems with the machine and I love how I can keep going back and dispensing a nice hot cup of coffee quickly, with one hand and no mess."
2,Great coffee for about 6 months,I bought this coffee maker for my husband in December 2006. He has a habit of breaking glass coffee pots so I thought this would be perfect. He loved it. The coffee was great. Then 6 months after purchase it stopped brewing. I'm now trying to find a similar machine that is dependable and not disposable.
2,no repair center available,"I bought this coffee maker for my family for Christmas. Has worked well for 4 months. Has now quit brewing, and I cannot find anyone who will fix it or replace it since I bought it from this website. I cannot find a phonenumber, Hamilton Beach will not work with me because I bought it from this site. I will not ever buy from this site again. I am not a happy customer and you know what they say about unhappy customers--we tell a lot more people than happy ones."
2,Does not work for long,This coffeemaker began leaking months after buying it. It never successfully kept the coffee hot and shuts itself off soon after brewing anyway. Waste of money!
3,No more broken carafes!,"I bought this for work, since we go through so much coffee during the day. Easy to hand wash only the two parts, and is idiot-proof with the one-touch dispensing system. The only downfall is that it turns itself off after one hour which would be really irritating if I were using it at home."
3,"Great coffee, but not worth the mess","I was so excited to buy this coffee pot a couple of years ago. I had been eyeing them, but they were too expensive. Then they came out with the non-programmable ones that were half the price, so I jumped at it. It does make wonderful coffee, is super easy to use, and fairly easy to clean. BUT...it began leaking within months of me using it. I don't even use it everyday (it keeps the coffee much fresher than a decanter, so I can either nuke it or use it for iced coffees for a couple of days). I imagine the washer shrunk? Or at least changed shape. It leaks all over my counter, and my husband and I both have attempted several times to fix it, but to no avail. Now, I'm looking for a new pot, because it's just too much hassle."
1,Not satisfied,I thought I would like the concept of dispensing the coffee because we have broken coffee pots on our tile floor. At first I did like it but the thing leaks all over the place and it isn't even a year old.
2,"i liked it at first, but....",I've had this coffee maker for about 9 months. At first it was great. Made good coffee. Kept it hot. Mine never had a problem with leaking. About a month ago I noticed that there was mold growing in between the two layers of the carafe. Now it doesn't touch the water or coffee at any point. But still. It's really gross. And there's no way to get it out apart from unscrewing the two parts of the carafe to clean it. And it doesn't seem worth it to do that everytime I use it.
1,"It doesnt Work, The coffe tastes horrible!!!","the coffe maker had a nice idea about potless, but the coffe tastes horrible we tried five times to get it right but it was either too strong or too weak, My advice is dont waste your money. This thing just doesnt work for small cups of coffe it might work if you make ten or twelve cups of coffe but not one or two."
3,Gone after 6 years,"This unit finally gave out after about 6 years. It's goingout the door because coffee is dripping everywhere from theserving aperture.I would not buy this coffee maker again: (1)It is Huge & ugly(we acquired it by earning points in the McCoy's catalog); had I seenit first-hand, I'd have chosen another home coffeemaker. (2)Water leaksout if the reservoir is not filled carefully. Sometimes water leaks outfrom the base for no apparent reason. (3)The basket is sometimes irksometo re-seat after having it out for cleaning.I like the convenience of & freedom from a carafe.The freshly brewed coffee was always hot & tasted OK--tho' I'm not persnickety."
1,Junk,I have had this coffee pot for a little over a year and I don't use it every day. In that year the following has happened1 The logo wore off2. The rubber stopper shrunk resulting in the pot dripping coffee all over my counter top3. It has lost it's ability to make hot coffeeI just threw it out today and am now looking for a more dependable machine
3,This Model Does Have It's Problems,"Just got off the phone with customer service..... very nice and willing to replace the machine- for a fee of $7.50. Paying for shipping does not seem fair. Our first machine lasted less than one month, it stopped pumping the hot water, the second machine had pump problems too. Not sure if the clock worked, we tried to program but it would not auto-start. Now The company is sending a third... I hope third time is a charm. We like the push-button coffee serve with no glass pot. A little bit of oxy-clean takes the coffee stains out of the plastic holder. I would buy from Hamilton Beach again, because of good customer service."
1,coffee puddles galore,"I bought this coffee maker attracted by the features-no carafe-auto shut off. I still love that aspect of the machine however I have constant puddles of coffee on my countertop. I am about to throw it away after only six months and bring the old Bunn cofeemaker that I have had for 15 years out of storage and had kept ""just in case"". The concept of the auto shut off is great but if I don't drain any left over cofee out of the machine it all winds up on my counter --so I might as well just turn it off anyway. I had read the reviews where people complained about the drip but thought ""how bad can a little drip be"". THIS IS NOT A LITTLE DRIP. It will entirely drain the machine if not emptied. Trust the reviews. Do not buy this machine."
2,Coffee tastes like plastic,"My husband and I loved the idea of a ""potless"" coffee maker. That is a great idea. However, we have been using this machine for a few months and the coffee is really taking on a 'plastic' flavor. Aside from cleaning the container, I don't know what else to do. We changed coffee brands a few times thinking that was the problem, but no, it is definately the plastic lining that is causing the problem. We are in the process of looking for another coffee maker. Unfortunately we cannot find another ""potless' one. I'm sorry to say this-but pass on this one if coffee flavor is important to you."
2,"If you want quality, look elsewhere...","I purchased this unit due to the fact that you could dispense without a coffee pot. In the past I have usually ended up breaking the glass carafe that comes along with traditional coffee makers. At first, I was very pleased with the unit and thought I made a great purchase. Eventually it started to drip and leak at random. The handle in the water/coffee holder broke. The top of the unit that lifts up broke off completely and now just sort of sits there precariously. Finally, this week it decided that it was not going to work at all. It will not make coffee. It will turn on, but not brew. I have only had this for a year and a half or so. Look elsewhere if you are looking for something that is going to last. (it was only used 2-3 times a week)"
2,Mold?,We have had it for 5 months and we never got use to the plastic taste. Then this mold started to appear between the linning of the coffee container. There is no way to clean between. Everytime I fill the thing up I see the gunk (which I suspect is mold) and it made me sick to think about it. Going to buy a reg. coffee pot today.
2,Pumpless brewstation :-(,"We received our brewstation (with program timer) in 02/2004 and this morning, 12/2004 the darn thing did NOT pump any of the cold water from the reservoir into the tank but the heating element was hot and the coffee grinds were dry !!My brother has the non-programed version and his will brew but, not pump all the water out of the reservoir. So, he shuts the machine off for a few minutes then turns it back on and the darn thing finishes pumping the rest of the water out and into the tank.I'll reluctantly send my brewstation back to Hamilton Beach for repair or replacement. Replacement will be better in case some other element decides to break after I get it back."
1,BAD! TRY THE NEW MODEL #47114,"I bought one of these models about nine months ago and I have had nothing but problems with it. My husband sent it in to the company and they sent a new one and the ""gremlins"" took over that one too. The clock stopped working then it would turn on and brew anytime it wanted even when there was no water in it to brew. I finally got frusterated after the 3rd new one they sent and asked them if Hamilton Beach would just send me something else of less value I was upset when they sent another but of another model but after a month of no problems I am happy with my new model. It has no clock and timer but it is worth the trade off in our opinion. Hats off to Hamilton Beach for standing by their product and sending multiple replacements!"
1,stopped fully brewing after 6 mos poor warranty service,"the concept is a great one and initially i wasa happy however as time went on the mechanism that heats the water would stop after a minute or so and i would have to keep turning it on over and over, the warranty had not expired but i was slow to act by the time i did the warranty was a month expired and they wouldnt do anything"
2,Leaks,"I love the concept of this coffe maker, but it leaks. It also makes a lot of condensation on the lid. Doesn't quite keep the coffee hot enough."
2,One year life span,"This worked great the first year, with only a few hiccups. If a coffee ground got trapped in the hole, then it leaked. Messy, but easy to fix by flushing with water. Then it began leaking all the time. I expect coffee machines to last longer than this!I hope Hamilton Beach improves this model. I like how it keeps the coffee fresh and doesn't scorch it for those lazy Saturday mornings. But, I wouldn't buy another one until some improvements are made."
1,Big and Leaky,"This is a neat idea ruined by shoddy manufacturing. First of all, this coffemaker is a lot bigger than most regular ones, especially the height. I can't fill this one without pulling it all the way out to the front of the counter. This takes up a lot of room for small kitchens or crowded countertops. The whole thing is also made out of plastic with a very cheap look and feel as soon as you take it out of the box. In just about 3 months of daily use, I've already had water or coffee leak out of the dispenser four times. Between the constant waste of space and having to watch out for leaks, I'd rather go back to pouring my own cups. The only reason I haven't thrown it out is because my wife bought it and I don't want to hurt her feelings."
5,Best Coffe Maker Ever,This coffee maker is well worth the price. The auto shut off is a great feature. I can make coffee now and it tastes the same two hours later. A great buy.
1,To big even for the biggest kitchen,"The Brew Station makes decent coffee at best. You still waste too much coffee when there are only 2 of you in the house that drink it. In addition, the brewer is huge. Even for my large size kitchen it is way to tall and bulky. I did experience a burnt taste with my maker but was lucky not to get a brewer that malfunctioned (of course I only used mine for about a month and returned it so I may have experienced the electrical issues if I'd have kept it longer). A new brand has hit the market called One on One or OneOne?? my husband loves it, i'm not completely sold on it yet."
1,3 TIMES AND STILL NO CHARM ...,"I read the reviews and noticed a few had issues with function. I bought it anyway cause what a cool concept. 1st machine, worked for nearly a week then just quit...decided I must have gotten one of the lemons and returned it for what I was hoping would be a working one...no dice, 2nd one never did work even right out of the box. Picked up a 3rd one that worked wonderfully for about 2 months then had all the electrical problems that others talk about. Turned it in for something on the shelf next to it, the Mellitta (spelling) One:One and that thing rocks!!! Similar concept but no mess at all!! One cup at a time in under 45 seconds!!! AND the big seller ... IT WORKS!!!!! If you're thinking about the brew station, look to the One:One, you're limited to the Mellita coffee but it's good coffee. and much easier!! Besides, who needs a clock on your coffee maker when you have one on your microwave, oven and wall."
5,Love this coffee maker,"When I first saw the ad for this coffee maker, I knew I would have to try it.I love the way it dispenses right into the cup, no dripping from a carafe. Makes great coffee that does not get that burned taste."
1,brewstation,"THIS PRODUCT IS BIG, BULKY, LEAKS ALL OVER THE PLACE FROM THE BACK, WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER ONE."
3,disappointed,"First we found the coffee maker too big to fit under the counter. Then it didn't make the coffee hot enough for our liking. We are wondering if it won't give the coffee a plastic taste, like coffee mugs after, a while. We do like the feature of not having a carafate to break. We will keep it but my husband just makes instant coffee now."
5,Brew ha ha,Very satisfied with the product. Brews faster than any other brewer we've had. No messy drip when pouring coffee like a coffee pot. I like the automatic shut off. We are notorious for leaving the house and not remembering if we turned off the pot. No more concerns. The filter does not fold over like many brewers do causing grounds to make it into the pot. The look is very state of the art. Consumer reports rates it high. Price is reasonable and it didn't take long to receive.
4,works exactly as stated love the no carafe living,It's nearly perfect - a little bulky. If I had spend more money for the deluxe model I would probably be in coffee heaven. I'm am prepared for the leaky seals should that time come but am enjoying the coffee immensely.
2,Great Idea- Poor Design,I have owned two of these coffee makers now. The first was great for about 6 months and then the seal came out and it leaked all over the place whenever water was put in it. Because it was such a great coffee maker in every other aspect I thought maybe it was just a bad one- got another and within 6 months the same thing happened. So it makes a great temporary coffee maker but if you don't want to spend money every 6 months for a new one- it just doesn't make sense. I should note that we are big coffee drinkers and were making 2-3 pots per day. As another reviewer noted the plastic gets really black and it is too hard to clean- you just can't see how much is left in the pot. I love the idea of the dispenser and I got many compliments from family and friends but it just doesn't hold out for the long haul- I'm currently trying to find a coffee maker that can hold up.
2,Annoying Ticking Sound,"Even though this a really slick coffeemaker (and makes a great pot of coffee) .. I'm totally disenchanted with the LOUD, clicking noise (resembling some type of ""count down"" on an automatic timer) .. which can be heard in my family room .. and the Brew Station is in the kitchen. Go figure! I sent E-Mail to Hamilton Beach explaining this problem. Has anyone else experienced same? Thanks, Helen More (Marlborough, MA)"
2,Not worth it,"The coffee was okay-- but had a consistent plastic/stale taste- I thought it was just me, but I tried many many many different brands/roasts/flavors of coffee and no matter what it had a weird taste to it. It tasted okay if you did a huge pot, but I don't need a whole pot just for me. Also, it's awkward to clean. The only redeeming quality is the dispenser, but still not worth it overall."
1,Short Lifespan,I received this Coffee maker as a Christmas gift in 2004. We have used it almost daily for the past 15 months. The past few days it became evident that the coffee was not remaining warm. I checked the keep warm plate and it was cool to the touch. Made another pot of coffee and checked the keep warm plate soon after the coffee finished brewing. It was again cool. My husband disassembled the pot and checked the keep warm unit on his meter and found that it no longer worked. I think 15 months is a very short life span for a coffee maker costing [...] +
1,The Big Dripper,"I purchased this coffee pot yesterday and thought it looked kind of neat. No pot to mess with. One handed dispensing. Cool. I have a two year old and a baby on the way. Nothing helps like an extra hand. Well, I had my coffee this morning. It was nice, hot and tasted good. I didn't empty it before I ran out to do errands. I returned to a really nice sized puddle on the countertop!! Cleaned it up and just for kicks, left it to see what would happen while I was gone for another two hours. BIG Puddle. I am packing it up to return tonight. Great theory from Hamilton Beach, needs big improvements."
5,One of my favorite all-time small appliances,"We've had ours for about a year now, and make coffee daily. We usually leave it warming for at least 3 hours. This makes the best-tasting coffee we've ever had (and we've had some pretty expensive coffeemakers) and it never tastes burnt. We grind our own, so you know we really enjoy our coffee.We've never had any problems with it leaking.It's relatively easy to clean. I highly recommend it."
3,Better than most Asylum products,"The Asylum puts out a lot of dreck, and this is no exception. But this time, there is some real movie-making afoot, with terrific scenery chomping from Bostwick and generally good sets, directing, and effects. The whale looks nothing like a real whale, which is sort of half-heartedly addressed, and there's not really much for Renee O'Connor to do. The movie is not so much ridiculous fun as Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus, and kind of falls apart toward the end, but it is still ridiculous fun. I mean, come on, a whale takes out a helicopter!"
1,Have to be a monster movie fan to enjoy,"This movie was very weak. However, I'm not the type of person who enjoys movies about animals, mutated or otherwise, gone wrong. If you are one of those people, my review won't help you much. If you're like me, and kinda on the fence, I encourage you to pass on this one. It was just awful in every category. The acting was pathetic; a string of never before seens, and never will you see again types. Dialogue was absurd. The whale was terrible; my 8 month old daughter could do better with a weekend training on my mac and its software. Avoid"
2,Moby Dick 2010,"This is a rewrite of Herman Melville's novel that takes place in the 21st century. the plot is thin, the storyline a shaky makeover. the scale of the whale seems to change with every scene. It starts out as a large whale, then a normal sized whale, then an enormous whale.this isn't worth the time."
1,BEACHED WHALE,"A loose remake of Moby Dick and absolutely ridiculous from start to finish. Barry Bostwick is now Captain Ahab Captain of the finest of America's submarine fleet, the ""Peaquad"" Bostwick ""Ahabs"" around with enough ham for Easter dinner with enough left over for sandwiches. It's pretty silly having the murderous whale being chased by a submarine instead of a rickety, beaten down boat. To compensate they make the whale ten times bigger but the CGI effects are so soggy that Moby looks like a giant, white turd with teeth. As expected Moby eats the rest of Ahab that he had missed before. Apparently Moby Dick is partial to ham.But my question is where was Ishmael? Unless Ishmael was supposed to be the bikini clad scientist who is ""requested"" to join Ahab and his merry band of whale chasers.A total waste of time but what can you expect from The Asylum whose movies always smell a little fishy?"
2,Not a bad premise,"You know what, hiding behind all the cheesy special effects, bad acting, ludicrous action, and nuclear submarines, lies a not half-bad story about a man obsessed with confronting his nemesis, about the brutal and unconquerable strength of nature, about the force of the captain's personality in spite of his madness, about destiny and fate. Somebody ought to dump all the crap and stick with the story. Only, that name--Moby Dick? Seriously? That'll never work."
2,Not as bad as you would think,"This modern retelling of the classic Moby Dick is a bit cheesy. The problems have more to do with all the information we now have about whales. The writer had to create a super monster that would never act like a whale. So they made it a combo between a shark and a whale and used recent stories about a humpback whale breaching that took down a small boat. The acting is fairly good a nice combo between the book and Crimson Tide. The problem becomes when they get to an island the story quickly becomes a unreal unstoppable monster against humans movie. It can breach onto land and crawl around can take gun fire and a rocket powered harpoon. Finally they nuke the island, which being so close to Hawaii would cause people to glow in dark and the scientist survives we presume to get cancer later. The whale survives to kill again. This would have been a much better story if they had done it on another planet, it just doesn't work as a modern retelling."
3,Dangerously Cheezy,"This movie is a classic ""B"" movie; cheezy and ridiculous in parts. Yet, you can tell that the actors had a real love for the source material. They put their hearts into it and played it as if it were a top drawer multimillion dollar ""A"" production. That is the saving grace of this film and what makes it a chip and dip funfest."
3,WHALE WARS,"Before watching a movie like 2010 MOBY DICK, you have to make sure your expectations are realistic--after all, it IS from The Asylum!Loosely based on Herman Melville's classic, this update gives us a HUGE whale, predictably hokey FX and unbelievable dialogue.But what's surprising is Barry Bostwick's over the top Ahab. Chewing the scenery mercilessly, it's a performance that outshines the material. The film's ending also foregoes most predictable endings and though rather quick, it's not what I expected.It won't be a classic but it's entertaining."
1,Doesn't worth time,"Just like the other Asylum created nonsense, this one is not worth time watching - very cheap effects, horrible play. Now I always read in the right bottom corner of a DVD box, and NEVER take THE ASYLUM HOME ENTERTAINMENT products."
3,Nice stretch. Can be tough on the jaw. Cheap harness.,"This traction kit provides a very nice stretch, but I found it to be tough on my jaw at weights above 15 lbs. I tried various seating positions to try alleviating the problem but found lowering the weight was the only solution. I do not get as good a stretch at the lower weight but I am able to pull on the cable intermittently to get an additional stretch and that works okay.The harness is the weak point of this traction unit. I found it cumbersome to don, the length of the straps from left to right were uneven by a full two inches, the velcro began losing it's ""grip"" after less than a dozen uses and overall the material and construction seems ""cheap"".If the manufacturer were to provide a better quality harness that was easier to don and moved the ""pulling points"" further away from the jaw I could recommend this unit, but not as supplied."
4,Works,This device might very well have saved me from an expensive spinal fusion surgery and a lengthy recovery. It's simple design does what it is supposed to do... it pulls your neck apart.
3,Worth the money,"I purchased this to aid in recovery of a shoulder injury. It was easy to set up and I'm able to connect everything myself. In short, it does the job. Instead of using water or sand in the bag provided, I attach a weight using the ""s"" hook attached back onto the rope - works great and no fear of a mess."
3,The water bag smells.,The product is okay. Just the bag smells like the materials made in China. I have to leave the bag outside when it's not used.
3,Really does help,"Not the immediate relief I had expected, but the next day I felt it.I have found that if I use it 2 or 3 times a week BEFORE I start to hurt, I stay pretty comfortable all the time.Chin strap could be a bit wider and more cushioned. I use a washcloth under my chin to soften it."
4,4 + 3 QUARTERS STARS - WHAT A HOOT!,"Humor - love - tension- a bit of a mystery!What was Cassidy after besides a home and roots for herself and her son, Hutch.Hutch was a self-proclaimed brainiac. But he didn't freak out Ty Merrick.You just have to love Cassidy's self-image. Three inches difference?Ty was intrigued by Cassidy and skeptical of his grandmother's reasoning and he definitely didn't trust the computers.The episodes when Hutch tried so hard to complete his experiments in love with his mother and Ty were hilarious.But tender love is woven throughout the story of a boy needing a father and his mother needing a husband. Hutch's version.This is the third in the ""Yellow Rose Matchmakers"" and the set is definitely worth reading -- and may be a logical keeper for wonderful reading.Definitely Recommended --M"
5,Such a sad movie...,"This movie made me cry, and I haven't seen a movie that's been able to do that in a long, long, time. It's a very sad story, made even sadder because, with just a little kindness and help, Arthur's and Joe's lives could have been so much less tragic.Set in a not so distant future (actually the past, now)where Jeb Bush is president and there is no Social Security, no social services, no safety net at all for the old and sick, ""Duck"" tells the story of a man on the brink of suicide because he has nothing left to live for. Until a little duck finds him and gives him that reason.But don't think this is a soppy, life-affirming, happy ending movie. It's not. It's grim, sad, and depressing. Very dark. It will make you feel sad. Watch it next time you think about voting for any bills that cut social services, poor as they are."
2,The void and the abyss,"In this unusual volume, the author, a professor of German atBrigham Young University, offers ""a dual homage, on the one handto Theodore Ziolkowski and to my other teachers at Princeton, andon the other hand to my faculty colleagues and students at BrighamYoung, with whom I have been blessed to associate for nearly fortyyears"" (p. 8).Ranging through such works as Mozart's Die Zauberflöte(The Magic Flute) and Beethoven's Fidelio, Wolfram von Eschenbach'smedieval poem and Richard Wagner's controversial operadealing with the Parzival legend, and the films of Wim Wenders,Keele reflects on themes of human deification, the need for a divineSavior, ""our blissfully arduous path to Godhood best negotiated bya monad of man and woman blessed with eternal increase"" (p. 7),""the temple as microcosmic heaven and blueprint for attaining thecelestial life"" (p. 8), and the emptiness of an existence void of transcendentmeaning."
4,Time travel was never this much fun...,"Harrison preceded the ""Back to the Future"" series by a number of years, and achieves much better and funnier results in one book than the three movies. And he pulls this off without any time paradoxes that are the staple of most time travel books.The story proceeds at a madcap pace and all the Hollywood stereotypes are more than adequately captured."
2,Disapointed,I got this book based on the reviews and was very disapointed. I don't know if my book was edited but it seemed like some of the story was missing. The story line was good but she didn't develop the main charaters attraction for one another. There was no conversation or interaction between the characters and I couldn't understand what brought them together. All of a sudden the're married and the girl doesn't love her husband and has doubts about their nationalitys. She's american and he's spanish. Why did she marry him then? The majority of the book made no sense.
3,"Nice design, but lame implementation","I liked the look of this product, so I got it. Used it once, and the lid melted (warped) in the dishwasher. I've never had that happen in the top rack of my dishwasher.So, if you're willing to handwash, the contents work just fine. Otherwise, skip this product."
1,Baby on the Go Blue,This product isn't work $25. It comes with cheap items in the bag. I only bought it for the bag and not what's inside. I shouldn't have spent the money.
5,"FUNNY, AND SHE DOESNT TRY TO HIDE HER T","what i really like about this book is how she holds nothing back. the lady is so honest about everything and i think it is very inspirational. it almost makes me wish that everyone was like that. as the book goes along you very quickly get to see her grow up from the boy she was to the woman she is today. the trials and ongoings of her life are enough to show that she is a human being and a person just like any other. and fro those who are wondering her T is her truth, and she makes no qualms about having to hide her candy. i just basically wanted to right about how funny and great this book. it is not very involving and dopes not require a lot of though, but it will keep your attention and keep you rolling on the floor in laughter. if you loved her in the movie than you will lover her even more in the book. i suggest getting it because i have not seen a copy in a very long time. it is definitely worth the time and effort!"
4,A fabulously funny offering from a true diva.,"In Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, we were introduced to the notoriously funny Lady Chablis. Now with her autobiography, she shares the stories that have made her the diva she is today. She evens offers her favorite recipes!"
5,Candy is Dandy!,"If you liked her in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, you'll be ecstatic as Savannah's Empress tells her ""T"". Hiding My Candy is loaded with delicious dish and devastating dirt. There is much to be learned from Lady Chablis, but if you learn nothing else, you will learn that you should never diss a diva!"
3,"Aren't we all ""Hiding Our Candy""","Since I am not a drag queen I do not share the superficial experiences of the Lady Chablis. But what I do understand is going through life trying to live up to an illusion, some I set for myself and others were predetermined. This is not denial - but a part of assimilation, part of being human and part of fear. We hide our candy so that others will see what we want them to see - in Chablis's case this is not a suppresion of who she really is but an expression of who she wants to be."
4,LOL I liked it,I think this CD overall brings old hits to life. You will know what I mean once you get this!
1,Product Features Misleading,Shows Glass and Plastic Lids. Assumed they came with product. They did not. I was very disapointed and believe the product should clearly state they are not included.
3,Not as Described,"I had ordered this French White 9-inch x 13-inch Baking Dish in Nov, 2005. It is advertised that it comes with Glass and plastic Cover. When Received There were no covers with this item. I contacted Amazon, to exchange and the new one didn't have the covers either. They Misadvertised and still in Dec 2006 they advertise that it come with covers when in fact it doesn't."
3,Where's the lid,Anyone know where a glass lid can be obtained?Would be many times more useful with one!
1,Outdated!,I was very dissapointed in finding that the maps on the CD is very outdated. The one cover the areas around my house (just outside Denver) must be over 30 years old. I am also dissapointed by the resolution of the maps. Not even near the picture shown on the box.
1,Very Dissapointed,Not for the serious hiker. This map is way off on its accuracy. Want to plan a hike on your PC before hand....Forget it. Contours are 100 ft. incurements. Very limited reference points. Actually had me on the wrong side of a creek. No bench mark refferences. Use your Garman Gps it's a great tool. But don't waste your time or money with this map. Stick to your USGA maps.
1,Very disappointing detail,"The detail on this software is horrible. There's an area we like to go camping and I found the area with this software. It has one of the 3 major lakes in the area, shows none of the forest roads, hiking trails, or campsites and I have it set on highest detail. Garmin makes great hardware, but horrible software."
5,Topographical software worked well in first field test,"In a prior review, I stated that the Mapsource topographical software looked good on the computer screen, but that I had not yet tested it in the field. Now I have. I gave it its first tryout on a long, difficult mountain bike ride in a remote part of Henry Willard Coe State Park near Gilroy, Calif. It worked as well on the GPS as it did on my PC, and again I have no hesitation in recommending it.Perfect accuracy is no more possible with this product than it is with United States Geological Survey topographical maps or other navigation aids, so those with unrealistic expectations of perfection will be disappointed.I agree with a prior review that it would be helpful to include a feature displaying the elevation profile of a given route."
2,I agree... the detail is lacking,I bought this product for hikes and to guide me in navigating rivers. Only very major roads are named so I can't use this very easily to calculate my route there. Most roads are there but they just vanish at some points and reappear in others. Using a real topo map it is immediately obvious that these same roads do not dissapear and in fact continue on their course uninteruppted like a road should. The elevations and detail are very course. No trails are shown. I am not very happy I bought this product and am going to look into the roads and recreation to see if it does a better job. FYI I bought this to use with my Etrex Legend which I think is just great.
2,Where's the beef?,"I recently got an eTrex Summit GPS and bought this software in order to download the trips I take into a printable format as well as to plan hikes before starting out on them. The bottom line is that this 3 CD-ROM set doesn't contain nearly enough information to do that. I took a 4 mile hike this weekend near San Francisco, and downloaded it to the software. It does show the track that we walked, but the topographic information from this software is so coarse that you can't tell that we went up and down, gaining some 500 feet in elevation since the contour lines are so far apart on the map generated. Furthermore, the road into the park wasn't drawn correctly, the ranger station and other services weren't marked and so on. In short, the maps provided won't allow you to plan a hike, which was the point in the first place right?"
4,"pretty good, but some weaknesses","It's taking me a while to get a hang of this product, but I'm able to download and upload tracks for my eTrex Legend, and that was my main goal. Trip planning also looks useful. It doesn't have many National Forest trails in it and the trails it does have are generally poorly labled. It's still a good way to make my GPS more useful and, possibly, avoid picking up too many free trail maps to clutter my gear closet. One gripe I have, but may be me learning, is that you don't seem to be able to open a saved map file and then add a new track to it. That makes it hard to create a long-term record of one's hikes."
2,Very Outdated New Hampshire Maps,"I just purchased this software with a Garmin eTrac Legend. I drove to the Seacoast down many major highways that were not on the map even though they are 10 to 15 years old. On my Garmin, I am always north of the features on the map, I don't know if this is a map error or a GPS error. The Mapsource software on the cd is old by several versions. The new software is free online. You do get what you pay for, this software is not expensive, but it is not very good on detail either."
1,Poor quality - avoid,"I bought the Garmin GPSMap 60CSx and about $400.00 worth of software. I was under the impression that the TOPO US 2008 product was the digital equivalent of the USGS 24K - but due to space concerns I assumed it would be perhaps half the resolution (otherwise my GPS would be the size and weight of a car battery). I was greatly mistaken at how inaccurate it was. After reading many other reviews, I said heck with it and ignored the nay sayers in favor of purchasing it. In my opinion, this item is worthless. I recommend that others avoid it. Garmin's units are great, but their maps and licensing (especially the unlock wizards) are a joke. I recommend buying another product altogether - the nay sayers are correct."
3,Needs updating,"If your GPS does not come with maps installed and you going to do some hiking, you will need thi program. The map data is ok, but it does need to be updated"
2,Garmin MapSource CD ROM,"Compared to Magellan Mapsend the detail provided by MapSource was poor, not up to date and overall poor quality."
3,"Ol,d","The data base used for the ToPo CD is old, very old. May not be Garmin's fault, but $75 for a 10 to 15 year old data base! I will take my business someplace else. Once again, great hardware not supported by software."
1,A FIRST CLASS PIECE OF CRAP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The topo softwear that is offered by Garmin is the poorest quality I have ever seen. I called Garmin myself and found out that they have not updated the topo softwear in more than a decade!!! Plus they have rivers labled as strems, major roads missing, and no road where there should be a road. I was so discusted with Garmin I sent my GPS unit back. If your looking for good quality topo softwear for a GPS unit try Lowrance GPS units. There much better than Garmin. Lowrance updates there softwear regularly."
1,Unless Your a Techi Pass on This,I got this software a couple of months ago and I still haven't been able to figure out how to use it. The instructions that come along with the package assume you are a computer geek. Pass on this unless you have a lot of time to try and figure out how to make good use of it.
4,Not bad.....,"While some of the maps are somewhat outdated, the program provides decent to even very good coverge to make the GPS 60 much more functional. Without this software, you're missing out on much of the capabilities of the Garmin 60 series. To me it's a must have."
2,Outdated maps and few street names,"The software works fine and uploads easily. The maps seem to be 10 plus years out of date since they are missing sections of state highway and local streets in the greater Seattle area that have been completed for at least that long. It also does not include street names for local streets, only state and Federal highways (I noticed it does include local streets for some small villages in Alaska).I definately would not recommend this set for urban navigation but I do like the topigraphocal features and the shoreline markers (but have not been able to determine if they are up do date)."
3,Maps not up to date,"Loaded good, however maps are not up to date. Maps were not as detailed, such as forrest roads and topo features, as other GPS software other people in our hunting party had. Overall I was happy with the software because I was able to find my way back to my vehicle at the end of the day. Always a good plus."
2,"All Talk, No substance","I bought this CD to help me plan a hunting trip in Alaska. I had planned on using the computer topo in conjunction with my GPS to plot routes to lakes, valleys, etc, to hunt. The topo maps for the area I am planning on hunting are incomplete. There are large lakes missing from the map, so the CD is limited in its usefulness to me. I have a paper topo of the same area and will be able to make my hunt no thanks to the CD-topo."
2,Mediocre Mapping,"I bought this product to be able to upload TOPO maps onto my Garmin eTrex Vista. This is the only product that will let you upload detailed maps to your Garmin unit, other software claims to work with your Garmin GPS, but they only download/upload waypoints. This software is way overpriced; it runs off the CD-ROM so it is very slow when accessing higher detailed maps. I tried copying the CD's to my drive and installing from there and it would not work. When pulling waypoints/routes/tracks from the GPS unit Mapsource always opens up a new map document, you can't import into the map you have open without copying and pasting. This is probably the most overpriced, counter intuitive and non-user friendly software created since MS Office. What this all boils down to is if you need detailed TOPO maps for your Garmin unit you'll have to shell out the cash and put up with slow unfriendly software."
2,Inaccurate and out dated,"I live in Colorado and am amazed at how terrible the maps on Garmin's mapsource are. Rivers start and stop. Roads that have been there since the 1800s don't show up. None of the trails are named. It's really bad. I would think that if Garmin was going to force us to by their maps, they would make an effort to improve them! I would say that anyone with a Garmin who is going to use it for 4WD roads and hiking trails should buy another mapping program to get waypoints."
4,"It is a basic tool, not a precise insturment.","This product is what it is. It isn't a fully detailed set of maps with every contour line and building on it. It is a basic set of TOPO maps that shows most local roads. What do you want for under $100 for a set of maps that covers the entire USA? It doesn't have every street name, the water maps are a little sparce, and some of the feature names are dated. I bought, I like it, I use it for what it is good for.Bottom line is that this is a tool like any other. You wouldn't build a car engine with nothing but a $5 pair of pliers but you could. You can mow your entire lawn with a $29 string trimer but you wouldn't. This is a basic $100 set of maps of the entire united states, for the price you can't beat the detail.If I had it to do over again I would still buy TOPO USA because it works for me."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped.....,"I'm used to USGS topo's, and their fine delineation and pinpoint precision. You won't find that with this software. The delineation on the maps is a dismal 66ft, and it's not terribly accurate on its altitude in relation to your location. Even so, it is better than being without a topo, but you may not want to throw out the USGS maps quite yet."
2,Not up to date,It is easy to load but the data is old and does not show accurate local information. It was too broad for my use.
1,Do Not Buy This,"Mapsource TOPO US has out dated maps by at least 6-10 yr (in Pa.) and half the time the map dose not line up with the GPS with roads and elevation. When I emailed them about update, I was told that the government sends them update and they haven't gotten any in a while. To me it sounds like there depending on other people to do there work. For the price they charge, they should be checking on the updates or doing them."
1,nearly useless in the city,"The box says that ""Highways & Roads"" are included and there is even a picture on the back of a dense grid of streets in an urban area. Unfortunately they don't provide street names for most streets (at least in the S.F. Bay Area) rendering this product nearly useless for urban navigation. I thought I could use this both for hiking and for driving around the city, but I was disappointed."
5,MapSource USA TOPO,"A great map to have when you are out hiking off the trail, I can find the easiest route around hills and swamps I wish to avoid long before they become a problem."
1,"Very imprecise, poor and obsolete software.","Very imprecise, poor and obsolete software. Lack of trails, roads etc.. , could be even danger in the remote area to person who trust it. You will have some use but rather with good paper topographic map."
1,WARNING! DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE!,"This software is garbage, it barely works even after being updated to the latest version available on their web site. Try zooming in or panning the map, or transfering to your GPS and 90% of the time it will crash or tell you an error occured. I can't beleive a company with a name like Garmin's would ship something so completely useless and overpriced. If you have a Garmin GPS and you want maps for your GPS you are stuck with Garmin's software: so don't buy a Garmin GPS either!"
1,Too little contrast,"I have used several Garmin units and maps with unabashed delight. After recently receiving my Etrex Vista and TOPO Mapsource map I set out into the mountains above Palm Desert. The Vista worked flawlessly but I soon discovered that the TOPO software presented a background gray that is almost identical to the track color, rendering the track almost invisible. In addition the intermediate elevation lines were very faint. Adjusting the contrast did not solve this problem. As soon as I unloaded the TOPO map, the track became clearly visible."
3,"OK, but not really good for hiking...","The map is ok for an overview, but not for hiking itself. I purchased it for hiking in the CA bay area, and lots of hiking trails, especially mid size and smaller ones are not included. Also there is no auto routing possible, so ou have to use additional maps to get to e.g. the trail head by car. It is ok if you use it for bigger and well known parks, but not really useful for real hiking."
2,You have to have a specific need for this,"Only get this mapset if you have a specific need for terrain information. I was a little disappointed about how painfully out of date the trail information is and this only leads me to believe that some of the terrain information is probably outdated too. Certainly, mountains don't change often, but some trail land does. I got it for terrain information of Hawaii and it was adequate. In this instance, there wasn't the option of using the National Park mapset. I can't say personally, but I would hope the National Park mapset is more up to date."
1,Not so good,"I am very disappointed with this software. Where quadrangles have been spliced together, the roads, railroads, rivers, and contour lines do not meet across the join. Line signatures change at quadrangle borders. Also, the data are not up to date. In Hamden, the Canal Rail-trail is shown as an active railroad. Finally, there are very few identified streets. Overall, the product looks like a rough draft, rather than a finished product."
2,Unfortunately its the only one with downloadable mapping...,This topo set doesn't have the necessary detail and I found myself buying printed maps at the local REI.... The software is very simplistic and map detail very poor. Unfortunately you can't download any other National Geographic Topo or Maptech maps into the Garmin unit so you're stuck with Mapsource. Bummer. I'll stick with printed USGS maps.
3,Time for an update,The copyright date on these CDs is 2002. The data itself may be reasonably current but I'm disappointed in Garmin for not updating the product to include the USB drivers required for downloading map data into its newer GPSs.
2,really low detail topo maps,"For hiking purposes these low detail topo maps are just barely OK. There's so little detail it isn't easy to create waypoints on your GPS if your hiking trail isn't already represented on this CD, and believe me, the trail data on this CD is not remotely up-to-date or detailed. I honestly can't reccommend this product unless you need just very general representations of topography. Garmin offers higher-res topo maps but only for very selected areas in certain USA parks. One should always rely first on a godd printed hiking trail map, but sheesh, I was expecting more from these garmin maps."
2,Not bad,"I bought the game because I am an avid Trap shooter. The graphics get you ""car"" sick after a while. Mouse speed not quick enough for real-life situation. Not the best game ever"
3,Not quite as advertised,"One of the reasons I purchased this book (aside from the obvious) is because the author's review said that instructions were included for making stained glass lamp bases, since prairie lamp bases were hard to find (at the time the book was published).The pattern book that was delivered to me had pictures of stained glass lamp bases on the cover, but there were no instructions inside on how to accomplish this. So... in my opinion, it was false advertising (Maybe this is a subsequent printing of the book and the patterns were omitted. Still it was disappointing.)The patterns themselves were fairly run-of-the-mill. It would have been just as well to have one full-sized pattern with lots of smaller examples."
4,Great Hairbrush,I purchased this brush and I really like it. It's works great on wet or dry hair. It also detangles.It's very comfortable to use as well.
4,Blinking Lights Attract Weirdos,"This is the second pair of Maxell Blinkers I have purchased. The fit is snug, but not tight, there is only one cord, so it doesn't tangle. I wear a lot of hats, and it goes round back, so thats a good thing. And I have a smalish head, and they fit fine. My only 'complaint' if backed up against a wall is, the stupid blinking lights. I mean if they blinked in time with the music, I could see the point, but they go round endlessly like a 3 legged dog!Im 28, and I dont need small children staring and pointing at me, as I stare out into space, trying not to be worried- If you get these, and I reccomend them, because the sound is excellent-deep bass, yet they dont disturb the person next to you - REMOVE THE BATTERIES or you will have all sorts of weirdos following you...unless that appeals to you."
3,False advertising!!!,"The sound of these headphones is pretty good, but nothing spectacular. My biggest problem is the fact that the product states that the lights blink to the beat of the music. Far from it. The lights blink at the same pace no matter what you are listening to and they look pretty cheesy."
4,slept on...,"this - arrested development's second album - was largely overlooked, their debut '3 years...' kinda got played into the ground. nonetheless, if you like arrested development at all, this is by far the superior of their two studio efforts. you can usually order it used for like $1, at that price, its worth checking out."
5,Powerful!,"A lot of people didn't respond to this follow-up album, but in my opinion, it is every bit as good as A.D's debut.""Africa's Inside Me"" is my personal anthem, and a truly profound song.The band is tight and Speech has crafted some awesome songs here.Again, how many bands include a spiritual consultant like Baba Oje? They respect where they came from, which is why they know where they're going, and when you listen with your heart, you will too."
2,Hook & Loop closure is too hard to open,"This seems in general to be a reasonable armrest pocket bag. There is very little clearance between wheelchair armrests and the wheel and this fits. But it uses a strip of hook & loop (""Velcro"") running the entire length of the pocket. It is very difficult to open even for a fully- abled person. The company has a 20% restocking fee ($4). Tthey charged $7.45 for shipping it in the first place. I would have to pay return shipping, plus time and effort, making the whole endeavor a loosing proposition."
3,A historical (monotonous) look at Fetish photos and sketches,"This book is a compilation of historical ""Bizarre"" magazine black & white photos and sketches of fetish women in various attire. The body type is always the same stylized extreme hourglass, large conical breasts, a tiny waist and round (rear). I was expecting something a little more diverse, given the title, and didn't know that in this case ""Bizarre"" was more of a title of a source magazine than a description of the book's contents.In some of the sketches you can see the form become so stylized that the arms are not even bound behind, but removed, and sometimes the shoes and hands have the same shape. You can see that the R. Crumb the cartoonist may have read these magazines, and took it to a new extreme.To me the pictures are endless slight variations on a theme, in other words in the first pages interesting, but in the end, boring. You really have to be a fan of this style to do more than flip through the book."
5,Much ado about little...,"Taschen's collection, sampled from issues of John Willie's BIZARRE, is a delighful look back at the work of a man who was in the forefront of eroding the 1950's, Ozzie and Harriet, twin-beds-in-the dark, missionary-style attitudes about sexuality. Back in the day, this was hot stuff, 'the-kind-men-like', (pre-Playboy) underground publishing. But be warned, it's a book more from historians than personal titillation. Our sense of 'what's shocking' has evolved so far that the average PG-13 movie probably eclipses any page in BIZARRE. One is left with a sense of 'what-was-all-the-shouting-about', yet John Willie was constantly skirmishing with the U.S.Post Office about whether BIZARRE was too pornagraphic to be sent through the mails. It's all here: dark, but still innocent, an opening salvo in the sexual revolution. It's a one-of-a-kind show. Don't miss it."
3,Not the Best Minn Kots I've Used,"Bought this for my son's 14 foot Jon boat. On the positive side, it is light and quite powerfull.The telescoping handle is kind of a neat design, but even in the shortest position it is too long for navigating from the back seat (nothing a pipe cutter won't fix). Someone didn't field test that very well.My biggest disappointment is the depth of the transome mount clamp on the motor. It is terribly shallow, so much so, that the clamp screw bells don't even completely clear the metal channel (the U-shaped channel metal that sits over the transom board). This high positioning leads to the motor rocking much more than it should. Not sure why Minn Kota shortened the depth of the clamp but it is bothersome and dumb.Like most Minn Kota motors, though, this thing moves some water!"
2,fun,This is a fun and easy way to get very inaccurate measures of peoples throwing skills. I do not recomend this product to anyone who want to use it in ex projectwork. You can get the same result if you gently roll the ball towards the radar as if you throw it with all your force. I only recomend this product for fun and laughs.
3,disappointed in the quality this time,"Our of 26 stories in this, the 16th of the Sword & Sorceress series, I can only say that 6 of them really impressed me. Impressing me means that the characters were interesting and I wanted to keep reading. It also means that these six were stories that I could understand the first time through and which I could enjoy and relax with. Yes, sometimes it is good to have something to think over and chew on but sometimes I just want a good story. There are several stories in this collection that if the characters had been more appealing I could chew over and enjoy but frankly I was disappointed this time around by the types of stories and the writing."
2,2.5 stars...,"Yup, it's me again... What can I say, THIS BOOK DID NOT LIVE UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED, Marion! :^("
5,"I own it, but I haven't read it yet...",Amazon.com is wrong. I just bought it at Borders in Hyannis yesterday. I am sure that this volume will be just as good as the 15 before it.
5,This book is a classic!,"This book is a classic work of engineering! The formulas are simple and somewhat outdated, but they can still be applied today in Basic Skills Classes and introductory classes for nonmajors."
5,A great how-to and sketchbook,"This book is a worthwhile addition to my ""how-to"" shelf for a number of reasons. It's one of the few books that addresses the idea of removing your own stumbling blocks to improve your skill as an artist. Very often, the biggest obstacle to getting something down on the page is yourself: some bad habit you've picked up, or a good habit you haven't developed. Better still, the book has lots of sketches by well-known artists and illustrators that you wouldn't get to see otherwise: a nice look at their own thinking and drawing habits!"
2,"Good intentions are not enough, alas","This would be a great book - if I already knew how to draw.When the first - the very first - drawing exercise starts out ""Draw a human figure"" (I'm paraphrasing, but that's basically it) I know that the target for this book is _not_ people who don't know how to draw. If I knew how to draw a human figure, why would I have this book? Looking at it objectively, though, I can see how it would be useful/helpful to an experienced and trained artist to use these exercises to 'unlearn' some bad traing and open up creative avenues, etc etc.But why not put in something for those of us who _can't_ draw?"
1,self congratulatory same ol same ol,Nice drawings in the book but that is about it. I don't like the North Light book club tone of this book. Which is your typical surface North Light surface dweller book. Get Spirit of Drawing or Art from Intuition instead.I don't agree with the chapter materials don't matter. If your not comfortable with your materials your not going to be creative.
5,What does it mean?,"I have often wondered what the films of the Brothers Quay mean. Or more precisely, if they have any meaning at all. Thanks to the excellent extras included with this DVD set I am finally starting to get an inkling. However, the main attraction of this set are the films themselves, which are presented in beautiful, pristine condition. I have viewed these films on an earlier DVD collection, but the quality of ""Phantom Museums"" blows it away! ""Phantom Museums"" actually includes a couple films I have not seen before! A must for fans!"
5,you have to be slow eyed,"I first saw the street of crocodiles in '95. I know that makes me late in seeing it and old, but it moved me. I have watched it over and over, ever since. This collection is wonderful in quality and representation of the Quay's work"
1,Vanilla Ice?,why? thats what i have to say i downloaded his songs if you want a laugh i say pic it up.
1,this for the first reviwer,i havent heard the cd.if you are such a nerd that you want to listen to this garbage than where are your reviews for weird al.dungens and dragons isnt a band.how come you use such big words.i got some advise for you listen to some skinless and impaled then write a review
5,Mind Blowin' Indeed,"Mind Blowin'...nay, Mind Altering...perhaps Life-Changing. The artistry presented through these 17 tracks has no equal. It is not a question of ""Will Vanilla's lyrics become quoted as Gospel?"", but rather a question of WHEN. I predict by 2012, lyrics from ""Mind Blowin'"" will become the most reprinted text in history, surpassing the Bible. Vanilla Ice is more than a rapper, he is an Apostle of truth. Women, do you not heed his call to enlightenment??? Email Vanilla immediately and beg to have his children. For then, the fruit of your loins will be of the one true faith: Vanilla Ice. Amen."
4,mind blowin,vanilla's 2nd major label release is very different from his first. This is his attempt to catch up with the new gansta rap sound. Most of this sucks but there are a few gems like the wrath which has a shot at 3rd bass and roll em up. Most of this is just a lot of talking about drugs over bad beats but it's still a good album and if you take the time to listen to it for what it is pretty good. if your a fan of early rap nwa dr.dre or early kid rock this would make a good addition to your cd collection if you can find it.
5,3rd Record Is A Charm,"This is Vanilla Ice's 3rd album. I really hoped that vanilla would come back strong with this album, but that just didn't happen. This was SBK Records final release, because during the making of this album the label went bankrupt. That left little promotional outlet for the album, and I don't really remember it having any singles or radio airplay. I purchased this album the day that it was released back in 1994, and after only hearing tracks 2,6,and 10, I gave it an A+. I don't care what the critics or any average joe says, Vanilla Ice is a hip-hop god; and if you don't think so, you are not a real rap listener."
1,Don't like smooth jazz,Just a response for Prairiedogger.It could possibly be The title track off the cd Hip Sway.
5,Groovacious,"My wife and I heard Chris Standring twice at Catalina Jazz Festival and both times thought he was the best act all weekend. We have all of his CD's and listen to them all of the time. By far, Groovacious is the best all all of his GREAT albums. All of them have a lot of energy and depth, but this takes his music to another dimension. I thought it was wonderful the first time I listened to it, but you have to listen to it over and over to truly appreciate it. All of Chris's music leaves you feeling upbeat and good about life, yourself and everyone else, but nothing like this. This CD is classic jazz that needs to be in everyone's collection. Buy it now!!!"
2,In Italiano,"This book is not for the begining student, I was taking a class and we did not use it. I have learned some Italian now and would might use it, do not know."
3,Nottz RAW & His Crew!!!,"I'm a big Nottz Fan, but this LP didn't do justice as I expected :(There's something missing about it. Its got its moments, like the opening track ""call the ambulance""... To be honest, the group can do better! If you love great beats from Nottz, get this! its got guests from Royce Da 59 & Pete Pablo...Overall a good hip hop album! Get it!!!!"
5,BRIGHT BLUE,Wish it could change different colors but regardless they are awesome BRIGHT can see it literally from a mile away. COOL you can change light patterns the human CANT miss it.
5,GREAT PRICE GREAT PRODUCT,I GOT LOTS OF GOOD THINGS THAT I CAN TELL FUTURE COSTUMERS ABOUT THIS SCANNER ONE OF THEM IS THE STILE IT LOOKS SO NICE AND PROFETIONAL ANOTHER THING IS THAT THE LED LIGHT ITS SO BRIGHT THAT DIEFS KNOW FOR SURE THAT THERE IS AN ALARM SYSTEM IN YOUR CAR EVEN THO YOU DONT HAVE ONE AND MORE AND MORE THINGS I CAN SAY BUT TO MAKE IT SHORT AND LET FUTERE COSTUMERS WHAT I THINK ABOUT THIS PRODUCT I WANT TO SAY GREAT GREAT GREAT EVO SCANNER
2,Our cats ignored the bubbles entirely,"Our two cats love almost every cat toy. They'll chase crinkly paper balls, catnip mice, laser pointer, and sticks with feathers. But they couldn't care less about these bubbles. We tried several times to attract their attention, but no luck.I had high hopes for these bubbles, it would have been lots of fun."
3,Cosmic Catnip,It smelled horrible.There weren't any directions. My cat ignored bubbles.I wouldn't purchase again.
1,This stuff doesn't blow bubbles. It just blows.,No bubbles. Utter failure. Complete crap. Sad kitty. Kitty wanted bubbles. Did bubbles happen? No. No bubbles. No bubbles at all.
2,Slow and Boring,"My better half tells me that the author of this series is very good, and the book this series is based on is excellent. But she agrees with me that this is the worst Swedish film we've seen recently. This same review will be applied to the other four films in series 1, save your money."
5,Here's How to Learn the Song!,"Cute book, but not really good unless you can sing it. If you want to learn the song, check out the video of a very old Lawrence Welk Show rendition on YouTube."
5,Board book A You'r Adorable,"This is a great book for babies and toddlers. As a retired kindergarten teacher and now grandmother to 6 month old triplets I like to sing it to the babies. They coo , laugh and babble when I sing it to them. It is a fun way to learn the AbC's either by singing if you know the tune or just saying the rhymes."
5,"""Alphabet"" primer for the toddlers in your life.","This book is absolutely fabulous for teaching the alphabet to a toddler. Purchase John Lithgow's CD to accompany it, if you don't know the melody. Perry Como also sang this song. My granddaughter sang and ""performed"" this song many times. I've since bought the book for several great nieces. It's a perfect book to have in your collection."
5,Wonderful book for children and parents,"Darling illustrations bring the nostalgic baby boomer tune ""A You're Adorable"" to life, making this book a family favorite at our house. We find that our daughter (22 mos) loves books that can be sung-- and has since she was less than a year old. The lovely illustrations show kids of different ethnic backgrounds and ages frolicking amongst the different letters of the alphabet. It's been a big hit with anyone we've given it to-- highly recommended!"
5,a book that glows,"It's not easy being a little kid sometimes, but this lovely and positive book is filled with nice things to say -- A you're adorable, B you're so beautiful .... Who wouldn't be cheered up?The illustrations are gentle but lively images of children playing around large letters. I am not familiar with the Kaye-Wise-Lippman song others have referred to, but the book is enjoyable anyway. Though I would rather have had a phrase for each letter of the alphabet rather than three strings (MNOP, QRST and WXYZ), I suppose that makes it fit the song.Particularly useful when your toddler or young reader is down in the dumps, this gentle reminder tells them that they are special and loved and important. If you know the tune, all the better!"
3,didn't like elastic in cuff,I got these to avoid the tightness around the ankle have badly swollen ankles and feet--wanted easy on socks to not have compression--got two pair of these also--disappointed
3,Too bad it's the only option for South America,"It seems that if you need maps for Peru and Ecuador, this is your only choice, The coverage is only so-so and there is little city detail. These maps are locked to the PC and MAC users beware. If you have a PC and a MAC, you can convert the maps to be readable on the MAC but you need a PC with internet access to do this. And by the way, your PC had better be running XP or Vista. Windows 2000 may work but 98, 98SE do not."
1,Marginally useful,"After a few years of use with WorldMap I would have to agree with some of the other reviewers about the dubious accuracy. Errors I have found include place names not spelled correctly, locations shown a considerable distance from where they really are, and even wrong road numbers given (using the wrong country road numbering system... well, duh). In that last case, the folks who assembled the WorldMap (at least the version that I have) somehow concluded that when you travel from Argentina into Chile (where I live), the Argentine national road number would remain the same in Chile. It does not take much experience to know that this is simply not the case. WorldMap does not really add much to a GPS load above the detail level of the base map... some, yes. My two Garmin GPS units are pretty good as the hardware goes. As far as the WorldMap program, it's a major disappointment and could get you into trouble."
2,Not much better than Basemap,"This adds very little detail over the Trip and Waypoint manager basemap. Added are some city names, topo lines, railroad tracks, small waterways, and obscure airports. I have not seen additional roadways and would not have purchased if I knew there would be no more road detail. Often in Latin America, the roads are incorrectly placed, making marked road tracking difficult. Standard Garmin Quality, which I have come to appreciate."
3,Garmin WorldMap CD-Rom,"I travel internationally and was looking for something that would give me an idea what cities I was over from the air, when riding on commercial transportation. This product does that well from the air, but as I read on several other reviews, on the ground, it can be another story. It can put you on the wrong side of a river or when riding on a train, the depicted track can be 3/4 mile away or more. I have the US Street map and that works fine and is very accurate, but the World database still needs some tweaking. I use it with the Etrex Vista."
3,WorldMap review,"Pros:Covers the world.Cons:Low resolution, so few roads are shown.It does not support point-to-point routing using roads."
2,Very little detail,"There is very little detail of USA and Canada maps. International maps are worst, with minimal details. Really a useless map."
3,It's OK,It's OK. It gives Mapsource world coverage though the detail is limited.I don't think Garmin makes this anymore. They're always changing things.
2,Disappointed . .,"With high hopes I bought this, and the world package, only to find it complex and incomplete. I will stick, now, with Google Maps."
4,VERY helpful!,This software really help me enjoy my E-trex a whole lot more. Being able to make waypoints from my PC was very handy. A nice accessory.
5,TURN YOUR LIFE TO GREAT,"THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THE TWO BOOKS DR.WAYNE DYER USES ON HIS TV SHOW AND IN HIS NEW BOOK CALLED EXCUSES BEGONE. HIS SHOW IS REPEATED A LOT ON PUBLIC BROADCASTING TV CHANNELS ACROSS THE NATION. THIS BOOK WILL SHOW YOU THINGS YOU NEVER KNEW ABOUT YOUR BRAIN AND WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO, AND THINK AND FEEL AND BELIEVE WHAT WE DO, AND WONDER WHY WE ARE NOT HAPPY OR SATISFIED."
1,"No substance, fluffed content. Painful to read.","I chose this book as an introduction to memetics. Infact its done nothing more than discredit the entire model and taught me nothing more than a glance at the wikipedia page and a quick google has. Dear potential reader, I seriously suggest you look elsewhere if your interested in this field."
3,A different perspective.,"It was a good book in explaining memes, which was an entirely new concept to me. However, the concept makes a lot of sense. Society programs us to be a lot of things, such as ""consumers, wives, and mothers"" even. Most people have been programmed to shop every season. I know people who only wear an outfit once, who buy DVDs and don't watch them, and who sadly, collect books that sit on bookshelves. Women were programmed to get married and have children. Who came up with these ideas? Unfortunately with globalism, American cultures are rubbing off on the rest of the world. Very, very sad state of affairs. I even read somewhere that India was opening up a Playboy restaurant.At any rate, this book also explained the concept of ""going viral."" Very interesting topic, but the book started to get kind of boring. I ended up stopping halfway through it. I think people would still find it of value though."
1,The Church of Memetics,"If you like this book you should consider reading Dianetics from L. Ron Hubbard and joining Scientology. Both authors claim to have developed a ""science of the mind"" which is supposedly superior to all social-psychological and biological studies combined. However, both are in fact just SCIENTISM / PSEUDO-SCIENCE in form of self-help therapy. I would not be surprised to find a ""Church of Memetics"" somewhere. ""Virus of the mind"" is a dogmatic book legitimated through erroneous popular conceptions of Science. BEWARE!!!"
3,Memes for dummies (3 1/2 stars),"Please be advised that this book does not take a cold calculated scientific approach at explaining memetics. Richard Brodie explains memes by recounting his personal discovery of memes, futhermore elaborating a fairly modest 'scientific' conclusion. I recommended this book to those merely curious about memetics. If you like 'guru-type' self help books you'll find that this book will suffice is explaining memes while expanding your consciousness. If you are looking for a scientific approach to memetics I would recommend Susan Blackmore's The Meme Machine."
1,"Great idea, poor book","The meme idea is very powerful, and must account for the number of positive reviews this book gets. However, this text is actually one of the worst ways to get an introduction to the meme theory.What bothered me most is that the author was not direct to the point in telling about the idea, and then developing it from there. Instead, he went around in circles, biting at the edges, and maintaining a constant ""wow, geez, look at it"" tone that was very easy to get tired of.Substance, really very little. I suggest try another book (there are few, start with Richard Dawkin's original the Selfish Gene)."
2,Initially interesting but overall quite thin,"I enjoyed the opening of the book. As Brodie's argument progressed, I became much less enamored. Having just finished reading Blackmore's the Meme Machine, I strongly urge anyone interested in memes to pick up that book either as a companion volume or as a substitute. Blackmore's book is terrific and grounded in research while Brodie's book reads more like a self-help book."
2,Ultimately The Memes of This Book Won't Spread,"Overly simplistic view of why some ideas become popular and others don't. Interesting because it analogizes spreading of ideas, or memes, to evolutionary spread of genes. There have been subsequent books on the subject, notably Malcolm Gladwell's ""The Tipping Point,"" and Seth Godin's ""Unleashing the Ideavirus,"" that delve deeper into how memes are transmitted."
1,new age hooey,"What a load of new age goobbledy-gook.. I read the first chapter and threw it across the room. I was expecting a serious discussion of meme theory in a digestible form, and instead I got this ridiculous mass of scare-tactic premasticated meme mush. Go read the tipping point, and leave this one on the shelf."
2,Virus of the Mind,"This book fell short, when it came to re-programming the mind. Too much talk about NLP.The best thing about this book, was how to advertise and sell your product or service.I would have liked more information about the link between Quantum physics and memetics, before I bought the book. It does show how to infect the public with your ""very own meme!"""
2,Forget this product . Don't u have better things to do?,"This product was a waste of the obvious. The book is joke. How are you going to teach using the ""adventures of eggbert"" and making example which are irrelevant to your point? Plus most of it is theory and very opinionated. Very opionated. He himself is infected with the ""money"" meme. He constantly shamelessly promotes his book ""getting past okay"". The book was designed for a person with a reading level below average. Unless you like to read inaccurate outdated information don't waste your money. I would suggest to u don't buy this book . Try getting another book. One actually written with someone with a PHD in that department , not by a second rate hack who got removed from micosoft. After all wat does a programmer really know about pyscology compared to a PHD pyscology proffesor like David J. Liberman?"
1,Not worthy of the Hay House name,"Read it all and sent it back to Amazon. This book is in NO WAY uplifting,nourishig,illuminating,or liberating. Hardly""ground breaking"". Just the same old psycological rehash slog in breezy dictation style. I guess I haven't ""evolved enough"" to rid God out of my life. And don't intend to. Worthless book. Why Wayne Dyer pushes it is beyond me. And listen up Louise!: It's NOT worthy of your publishing house name!"
3,Good Intro to the Subject,"Just finished reading Virus of the Mind. It is a fairly good book. I like it because it introduces well a new subject area and is easy to understand. However I wish that it had been worked on more before it was published. For example, several sentences were not clear. They would have been more understandable if spoken rather then read. I suspect that the author dictated the book into a word processor."
2,I Couldn't Get Past OK,"Richard Brodie developed Microsoft Word. Perhaps he should stick to writing computer software. I found only about a third of this book informative or helpful. Now that I think about it, I find only a third of Microsoft Word useful."
1,NOTHING,"THIS BOOK IS MUCH TO SAY ABOUT NOTHING, I GOT IT ON AUDIO SO I LESSENED TO THE AUDIO TWO TIME'STHE BOOK WAS RECOMMENDED BY WAYNE DRYER IN ONE OF HIS TV EVENT'STO ME IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE IT ANY STARS BUT AMAZON WOULD NOT ALLOW IT."
4,Worthwhile but too self-helpish,"While Brodie has some good insights and arguments, the book is very derivative and really bends over backwards to evangelize to the average American. So if choppy writing and pop-up hightlight boxes really annoy you, watch out."
1,"it's a no-brainer, I want my money back!","The whole book could be summed up in a few pages. I left it in Tulum, Mexico. If you want a copy, don't buy it, go try and find mine on the beach! It might be perfect if your looking for a book that has little content and a lot of filler."
2,disappointing,"I bought this book sight unseen, hoping for a good book onmemetics. But what I got was another ""self help"" book witha meme gimmick. A much better buy (also from amazon.com)would be de Waal's _Good Natured_."
3,Really interesting....,"Mr. Brodie has written a whole book on the metaphor of the ""Meme"". It is a very interesting even entertaining read but I would hesitate to say that it introduces a ""New Sience"". As humans we have neglected the investigation of ""Mind"" too long or left it to those who have other axes to grind... The idea of the Meme at the very least begins to give us a vocabulary with which to begin that is not based on the nearly superstitious views of our cultures..."
2,"Easy-to-read, light-weight intro. to memetics","Virus of the Mind wants to piggyback on Richard Dawkins' concept of the meme but it is done at a very superficial level. The author is probably targetting the consumer of pulp science and, from that viewpoint, he does an OK job. The worse side of this book is that there is little effort to provide hard evidence on its theories. (What's Richard Brodie's background on genetic evolution or biology!?)If you like science in general and want something really light to read during summer by the swimming pool, then this book is alright. However, readers wanting to have a better understanding of memetics are better off by checking Susan Blackmore."
5,How What You've Been Told Can Hold You Back,"This was mentioned in one of Wayne Dyers PBS and video presentations, sounded interesting and so I bought it! Goodness Gracious! What a wonderfully revealing work on what those seeds planted in my mind by parents, friends, teachers, family, enemies, detractors, and people who don't really matter have done to my little psyche to screw up my life! Amazing, Grace! Once the secret was revealed as to how I had been mentally ""programmed"" just like a computer, and was still running on those ""instructions"", Wah-Lah! We undid a whole host of inhibiting gar-bage and have been rocking on ever since! Great stuff for those who want real adventure in knocking the socks off of some unnecessary family traditions.... Whew! WARNING: Do NOT buy this book if you don't want to experience all kinds of reactions to the changes in you... if you are happy with your status quo, don't go here..."
4,"Care and Feeding of our ""Input...""","Richard Brodie's ""Virus of the Mind"" presents us with the summation of a new way to envision how our mind (and 'mindsets') are truly 'composed.' It is impossible to read this treatise and return to life 'as it was' before being exposed to his insights. Now, I have a constant awareness of the 'stream of memes' that are fighting for space (and, in some cases, dominance) in my mind and, thus, in how I personally think about 'my reality' in life.The result of acquiring this information is a better sense of the control that we can have over the formation of our own 'mindset,' freeing us from the subtle intrusion of well-designed 'memes' that want to influence that control.If you have a curiosity about how you have become 'you,' this book and its cogent information will provide you with multiple 'insights' and enable you to build defenses for 'meme-monitoring.' This is truly empowering on the personal level."
3,Immature and Important,"If you can bear the author running down a few strechedtangents, you will read one of the most thought provokingbooks of the year. It is not very refined and the microsoftsubculture tales were tedeious, but the ideas were worthworking past all that. ""Mind viruses"" and the probibilitythat ad corporations are intentionaly using them is terrifying.If large companies were not before, they certainly will beafter reading this book. Brodie also does an awakeninghistory of thought and computers, but the chapter I rehash inmy mind the most is the survival of the fittest DNA and modernsexual roles. Virus of the Minds is a little bit clumsy andvery unforgettable."
2,Well-meaning mistake.,"No doubt this book is written with the best intent, but it is truly sad to see that Richard Brodie has misunderstood memetics on a rather fundamental level. Going on about memes as some kind of battle between good and evil, with examples like ""unwed mother"" (bad meme) and ""the traditional american family"" (good meme), he just proves that the idea of memetics has not passed the filter of his own his cultural bias. Memetics is not a question of ethics or vague self-improvment mumbo-jumbo, but a serious attempt to understand consciousness.If you are truly interested about memetics, read Dawkins and Dennet critically, and make up your own mind. This book with its Readers Digest-attitude is only recommended to those that want to learn a few empty phrases for social occasions, or want a pseudo-intellectual coffe-table-adornment."
1,Ridiculous!,"Pretends to be scientific, but is simply trivia turned over and over. I can't believe this is being reprinted (originally 1996) and available in stores. Garbage!"
5,Wonderful Nikon 80,"I ordered this camera a few weeks ago and I love it, I had a Nikon SLR I bought back in 1984 and it was a great camera and still is but it was time to get a digital one, I haven't learned all about the new one but what I have learned is great, the pictures are wonderful, I am very happy and so glad I decided on it, I love Nikon anyway and this one is the best I have ever had and I will be using it in Europe in a few weeks."
4,MODERNE MUSIC AT IT'S BEST.,"In '96, I began (with fervor), a quest to discover moderne Music that wasn't being played on most radio stations. (Yet I knew must exist.) Being a lifelong DJ and musicologist, I knew, in depth about the history of Roots music. I was now ready to go into the future. One of the first bands I encountered was a trip=hop/moderne lounge band from Belgium called Hooverphonic. Their debut album called ""Space-Age Stereophonic Sounds"" was out and I loved them immediately. With hints of 60's Pop & Lounge, they were thoroughly modern. Synths & drum machines blending with acoustic & electric guitars, harpsichords & other exotic instruments, backing ultra intimate & sexy female vocals. A winner all the way through. I've been a fan ever since & played 'em on my radio show many times. This singles CD is a fab introduction to one of the koolest moderne bands around: HOOVERPHONIC!"
2,Save your money.,This very short story with very large print is way over priced. McMurtry tries to make up for this Lonesome Dove remake in the last chapter but fails miserably. He should be ashamed for charging so much for this average story.
2,Ranks well down on McMurtry's novels,"This book carries on with McMurtry's Western format: lots of crusty and unpredictable characters, strong men and women wandering across the plains.The difference here is that the plot is straight-line and boring. All those wonderful side stories that the author has woven into past books are missing.I kept waiting for a surprise. There was none."
2,Expected more,"I found Boone's Lick a little disappointing. I was expecting more.The story follows a family's trek across the plains from Boone's Lick, MO to Fort Kearney in Wyoming. Along the way they encounter, well pretty much nothing.They get to Fort Kearney, the climax of the story happens (kind of an anticlimactic ending) then the book is done."
4,Larry McMurtry & Will Patton - Best Duo In The West!,"The story is quite good but, now and again, seems to get into a different mode. I mean one minute he seems to be talking to us of events yesterday or last week, then the next as if it was years ago.The reader, though, is the perfect compliment to the ideas conveyed by the author. It was easy for me to imagine the subjects face simply by hearing the narrator's voice speaking the writer's words. I was able to easily imagine an old shipmate (M. Hill of Missouri) telling some of us his life story.Had the last chapter been omitted I would have given this five stars. Even so, I and all my friends at westwardho.us would have been proud to have written a book only half so well as Larry wrote this'n - Bill Anderson."
3,Boone's Lick,"I am a huge McMurtry fan, especially his westerns. The ""Lonesome Dove"" books were among my very favorites. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but ""Boone's Lick"" was a disappointment. It was too short, lacked the depth of character development that is normally so well done by McMurtry, and really did not seem to have much of a plot. The dialog was entertaining as usual, but there just seemed to be something missing. It does not rank among Mr. McMurtry's finest works."
2,Not Enough for Me to Like Here,"I love pioneer stories. That's why I picked up Boone's Lick; it sounded like a winner - a strong female character leads her family West. Shortly into the book, though, I knew I'd been duped. Although there are some pioneer elements to this story that I liked (I especially appreciate the family's struggle to keep their wagon together), this seemed like a long, pointless journey where the scenary hardly changes and you can't get close enough to anything to see any detail. With six chapters to go, I found myself thinking, ""What's the point of this?"" When I finally got to the climax, it was so hurried and emotionally flat I felt quite let down. I came all that way with a group of characters who got on my nerves for THAT????"
5,"Good story, great dry humor, wonderful narration on the CDs","The characters and their dry humor are better than the story, which is pretty good. The narrator Will Patton really makes the characters come to life. Historical details are nicely woven into the story. If you buy the book and miss the narration on the CDs, you will miss a lot. I gave it 5 stars because when I listened in the car I always wanted to keep listening after I arrived at my destination. And I want to find more books on CDs by this author and narrator. I even liked the incidental guitar pieces at the end of each CD. In fact, I listened to it two times, back to back.Reviewers, please consider that people who have not yet read the book might read your review, so please save them a surprise or two."
4,McMurty writes a simple story.,"I have read just about everything by McMurtry and like the man. His nonfiction work 'Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen...' moved me. Larry suffered and did not feel like himself after open heart surgery. The writer who entertained was struggling just to be, let alone worrying about writing. Now he writes a simple story. 'Boone's Lick'. Maybe not an epic, but hopefully Larry is feeling more like himself. It is nice to see Larry writing and maybe he has another epic up his sleeve, and then again maybe he doesn't. It was nice getting to know Larry McMurtry and the man will always hold a special place in my heart. Anything he writes deserves to be read, just because he wrote it."
3,Eagerly anticipated,"A great fan of Larry McMurtry, I couldn't wait to read his latest work of fiction. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with Boone's Lick. The well developed characters and rich dialog so typical of a McMurtry western are not present in Boone's Lick. The characters are flat and have a tendency to abruptly disappear before significantly enhancing the story."
1,angry and confused,I never received the product or an explanation even after inquiries with Amazon and seller.
3,On the Western trails,"Another version of LONESOME DOVE, though not a sequel and not nearly as good. A family, led by the formidable Mary Margaret (McMurtry loves very strong female characters), takes off one day from Boone's Lick, MO, in search of Mary's husband, Dick. They travel across the Oregon Trail to Ft. Laramie, and then to Ft. Phil Kearney on the Bozeman Trail in Wyoming (arriving just in time for the Fetterman massacre). When Mary finds her husband she sees he has a number of Indian wives, so she ""quits"" him.All the McMurtry touches are here - the humorous, understated dialogue; the accidents (Mary's father dies right at the beginning of the journey); the finger of fate everywhere; the appearance of some famous historical people. But the book feels tired and rushed. He writes as if he were trapped in the Western setting created by his great successes of the past and can't get out. A disappointing work."
2,Can't recommend it,Boone's Lick held my interest long enough to finish reading it but if it was twice as thick I probably would have given up. The book seems to be many short stories strung together with only tenuous cohesion. None of the stories develop into anything all that interesting.
2,Boone's Lick,"Having read and very much enjoyed Lonesome Dove, I was disappointed by Boone's Lick. It's the story of Shay, who travels with his mother, uncle, and assorted other relatives and followers from Missouri to the West as part of his mother's attempt to locate her long-gone husband.The book has some of McMurtry's strengths: the humor, the clear, spare writing style, the appealing working-class characters (including the mules). But the plot is shallow, the characters are never really developed, and the end sudden. Overall, the book feels as if the author were just going through the motions; as if he were bored with the work. Mary Margaret and Seth, particularly, might have been interesting people, but the reader never gets to know them. I'd skip this in favor of McMurtry's more carefully written work."
2,This book must have been rushed by a deadline...,"I bought the unabridged cassette tape version of this book, to keep me company on a long business trip in my car. I had visions of another Ned and Zeke, another book on tape that I treasure, from McMurtry. For the most part, being from the same part of the country the book is set, I enjoyed it...as I got to the sixth and final cassette tape, however, I became worried...how can this story end now???? And it did...just like he had run out of paper in his word processor, or ink, or ideas, or his advance....he sews the story up and ends it just when things are getting exciting. The book ends up like a book that was salvaged from manuscript form when the author died suddenly. Larry, I love your writing, but I want my money back for this one. You KNOW this wasn't ready to publish, yet you let your publisher go ahead and publish. Shame on you. When a writer begins to love his money more than his characters and his product, it's time to retire."
2,Lonesome Dove Lite,"Larry McMurtry is a very uneven writer...his ""Lonesome Dove"" series was excellent, as was ""Buffalo Girls"". The more modern stories, such as ""Texasville"" did not hold my interest at all. So, when I saw Boone's Lick I was thrilled. I bought it and anticipated great enjoyment in it. Well....the POTENTIAL for a good story is there...the good story, however never gets fleshed out. It's like the difference between intricate tapestry and big clumsy stitches...Boone's Lick being the second. This book really belongs in a magazine as a short story...one that does not tax you with details, rather than as a full-priced book."
2,"Come on Larry, Your Better than This!","This story and these characters could have been another ""Lonesome Dove"", but Larry McMurtry wanted us to ""show him the money"". This is an an epic short story that could have been developed into a true epic novel. The quality of the writing is right up there with ""Texasville"" and you will die laughing on several occasions. On the bright side for Mr. McMurtry, it is perfect for a movie instead of a mini-series, so he'll reach a much larger, royalty paying, audience."
4,First time McMurtry,"This is my first exposure to McMurtry. I have not seen or read Lonesome Dove although my mom has been trying to get me to read the book for some time. I listened to the audio edition of Boone's Lick and it kept me entertained during my long Christmas travels. I am definitely going to get Lonesome Dove based on the readers comments that this book is not true McMurtry. If Boone's Lick is substandard McMurtry and I really liked it, then Lonesome Dove must be a masterpiece."
4,Very Good,A short but excellent story - a pleasure to read with interesting characters - written in the classic McMurtry style.
4,a good read,"A little slow starting, but worth wading through the shallows a bit to get to a nice story line. Not quite as intense as most of McMurtry's books, but a good read."
3,I DIDN'T KNOW MCMURTRY WROTE SLAPSTICK,"This book is unlike any other book that I have read by McMurtry. From the first when Ma Cecil shoots a horse out from under the sheriff and says that she thought it was an elk, I knew that this wasn't going to be a regular western. I was right.This is the story of the Cecil family led by Mary Margaret, the matriarch of the family. She takes her family, including 4 children and a mooney eyed brother in law named Seth, on a trek to Wyoming from Missouri to find her wandering husband named Dick, appropriately enough.On the way they pick up an aging indian named Charlie Seven Days and a portly monk named Pere Villy. They meet several bands of indians, have a tussle with the Missouri River and meet several new family members.This book is an easy read and you will get a laugh or two along the way."
1,HORRIBLE customer service!,"This item was very important for my small baking business and not only did I never receive this item, I had to call them for a refund. The response I got from them regarding the no-show? ""Oh, did you want to re-order it?"" Uh, NO! I had to tell them they needed to return my money asap, which they did do (the very least). I will never do business with this company again and if their ratings are to believed, I'm not the only one very unhappy with them lately. I gave them a single star only because they did return my money."
3,Dissatisfied,Coffee table part that was glued on fell off - I fixed it but there is still a glue mark I can't get off. Leg for one of the end tables missing and I'm still waiting for it. Assembly is easy and it looks very nice once I can resolve these problems.
5,MY SECOND STARSHOT REVIEW(I'M THE 11 YEAR OLD GAMER),"Starshot is a platform-adventure game and it also has some shootin' in it.On the box it says that it's reccommended for all ages but you have to be really smart for the game and about 10 years.I have the game about 3 and a half years and and i haven't finish't it.(I'm at the end but that's also very difficult.)the boy's review from the ""GREAT GAME""(it is a great game) isn't good,cause he only played the demo,and if he played the real game,he would also say that it's a hard game<...edit..."
3,Good deal,"Well, I purchased this perfume a while ago, but sadly, I only received it after 28 days. The reason is that Amazon delivery to countries like Lebanon is a bit slow and that is associated with the distributor contracted by Amazon. In any case, I guess within few years, online shopping will be more attractive as the service becomes better."
3,"Wife Loves It, But Package Was Open!","Bought as a Mother's Day gift for my wife. I didn't notice this when I received it, but apparently the package was open and the perfume was slightly used (she noticed it after I gave it to her). She liked the scent so much that she didn't want me to return it and wait for a replacement. First time this has ever happened to me with an Amazon product. Maybe it'll never happen again, but you might want to look more closely than I did, especially if it's a gift..."
1,Not impressed with this scent!,"I was disappointed with the scent of this fragrance. It smells cheap and needless to say the scent does not last on the skin. Will not buy again and will not recommend it, but to each his own. (some persons will still love it)"
5,Really cool songs that even teenagers will definitely like.,Any Beach Boys fan will love it and even people who aren't Beach Boy fans will learn to love it and will love to listen to it. It's really cool and up to date. Buy it and listen to it! It's really great!
5,America's #1 group responds to Beatlemania with a #1album,"In the 1960s, albums released in America usually timed out at appx. 1/2 hour, with about 12 songs. Sadly, Capitol Records deleted the catalogue of Beach Boys two-fers, in favour of the original packaging seen here. As it is, All Summer Long is a first -- first response to the Beatles, first of the magnificent Brian Wilson-produced albums featuring all of Phil Spector's musicians, the Wrecking Crew, and first to really break the mould of only surf and car songs. Brian wouldcompletely realise this non-fad album cycle with Today and Pet Sounds in the following two years. This album stands at the beginning of BB Phase II: Phase I was the surf/car records, Phase II inclu- ding All Summer Long/Summer Days/Today/Pet Sounds, and Phase III was the post-Pet Sounds, non-Brian-produced, collaborative period for the Beach Boys. Stellar production and vocal arrange- ments, catchy timeless tunes...what more is there?"
5,A Great Book,I loved this book. I read it when it first came out. I think it was one of his best!!!!!!!
4,Excellent characterizations.,"The story maintains interest throughout and the characterizaations are excellent. Demille is able to make you feel the personalities, put their shoes on, live their lives, and take you away from your own daily routine. A very enjoyable book to read."
4,Great summer read,"This is a very well written, wry and somewhat cynical look at money, corruption, the legal system and the ""gentry"" class of America.A great read for the beach or wherever. It does unravel a bit towards the end but in this case, it's the getting there that counts versus how the story wraps up.Highly developed characters are built and enjoyed from the least significant to the most. This is the greatest appeal of the book.Guaranteed good fiction. Enjoy."
5,Gatsby on the Gold Coast--A Classic Read!,"This is one of my all time favorites. I just got lost in this book--did not want it to end. It has everything, a strong sense of time, culture, and sly sense of humor. Very well written, I wish he would return to this style for his next book."
2,.?????????,"I've read several books by this author and thoroughly enjoyed them. I don't know what it is with this one but I can't seem to get through it. The protagonist seems to be going through mid life crisis, which is causing him to chuck what he says he believe's in aside. Oh well, I may get through it one day and actually enjoy it."
1,Gold Coast,"I love a good thriller and mystery, so I was seriously disappointed in this book. The story goes on and on with details that are irrelevant, boring and just tedious. I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen but it never really did. This was my first DeMille book and frankly I have some concerns about reading another one."
2,Ho Hum...,"After reading ""Word of Honor"" which I thought was excellent I found this one pretty boring, at least until I was more than half way through. The next few chapters had me engaged but the rest was a total anticlimax. Most of the relationship between the Blue Blood WASP lawyer and the Mafia don was totally unbelievable in that no Godfather would ever share with an outsider what Frank don Bellarosa does in this book. The gratuitous sex scenes between the lawyer and his wife were kinky and totally unnecessary. I'm no prude but they were, I suspect, only in there for fill and those who need such in a book to bother with it."
3,Skip the first half...,"I will admit, this book was entertaining but did not become so until nearly 1/2 - 2/3rds of the way through. I found it hard to relate to most of characters because of their extraordinary lifestyles and terrible personalities. In fact, the only character I really liked was Frank the mobster, but maybe that was the point. The story seemed to go from very slow and dull to full speed and then jumped around chaotically. At one point I actually thought that maybe I accidentally skipped a chapter relating to an affair between two of the main characters. The ending was pretty sudden and not very exciting as I had hoped. Because I never really could relate to the characters and found myself disliking them so much I didn't care if anyone lived or died or went to prison for life. Out of over 600 pages, there were probably 200 that had me wanting more, the rest was fill."
3,Mary from Novi,Boring at the beginning - but gets good in about the middle (and is great at the end). Not one of DeMille's best though.
5,Best Book I've Read in a Long Time,"I am a college student and I thought that this book was so good. I couldn't help but read just ""one more chapter"". Usuallly, I would never have time to read such a long book, but I couldn't even put this one down. Before I was done, I ran out and bought Charm School which I am reading now. I recommend this book highly. The characters stay in your head even if you aren't reading it -- a sign of a good book!"
3,Different but good,"I am also new to Demille, having only read Charm School before Gold Coast. Very different books - Charm School is a tense spy thriller while The Gold Coast is a slow story of a laywer and his wife locked into their stifling Long Island life. Similarities: I came away with a greater understanding of each books' real-life settings, people and politics. Great writing, details, laughs and insights. Not a page turner like Charm School but well worth it."
3,Mystery? Thriller? I think not.,"I cannot come to grips with this book as a mystery or thriller. It simply is not. Though superbly crafted with excellent character development I found myself waiting through the first half of the read for something to happen. Once the pace picked up I enjoyed the next 200 pages, but was again disappointed by a very predictable ending. The book is probably best described as a social commentary and may be worth the read from that point of view."
2,Love those loooong Italian lunches!,"This book is overly long, thinly plotted, and all of the character are hard to like (which may have been the author's intention), but the description of the three-and-a-half-hour lunch that the mafia don and the Waspy protagonist share at a little Italian restaurant is priceless. Capisce?"
2,"Good but not great, Capische?","I give DeMille credit for trying something ambitious and atypical for someone known as a 'suspense' author. 'The Gold Coast' had an interesting premise and characters, as well as a touch of humor. Unfortunately, the book suffered from too much detail about everything, whether or not it was significant to the plot.The gradual shift in tone as John and Susan's life begins to fall apart eventually leads the book into cliched 'mafia thriller' territory. By the end of the book, the reader is left almost exhausted, yet somehow disappointed, that a book that promised so much didn't quite deliver.Much like those tasty but not entirely healthy Italian delicacies that Frank tells John 'you gotta try', this one is best read in small doses until it's finished."
1,Long and winding novel -- a sleeper,"I was suprised to see how well this book has been rated by others. I could barely keep my eyes open throughout. I LOVE most of Demille's books especially Charm School and Plum Island. However, in The Gold Coast, Demille spends the first 150 pages going on and on about the lifestyle of the Gold Coast, while only occasionally stopping for a sex scence.......The book never seems to lead to anything worthwhile. I found it impossible to like the characters, and in fact I grew to dislike John and Susan. The plot seemed to have potential, but I kept waiting for it to get exciting. I kept telling myself to read another 50 pages and maybe it will get better, but it never did. I will certainly give Demille another chance, but I hope the next book I choose is nothing like this."
4,Classic DeMille,DeMille has such a great writing style that I like. He paints a great picture and you really get to know the characters. Great book.Damn funny at times.
2,What should be an interesting story is BORING!!!,"The Gold Coast should have been a great story. Set in one of the most beautiful and interesting places on the East Coast. The characters are some of the most one dimensional, unlikeable, and uninteresting that I have encountered in a long time. John Sutter, embarassingly takes on the affectations of a Mafia boss, the characterizations of which fall flat and fail. His wife, Susan, is a spoiled rich, nymphomanic, disturbed girl. The Mafia boss, Frank, lends us no new insight into the psyche of a gangster - his wife is a one dimensional character whose main job is to cook, clean and blubber around.Watch reruns of The Soprano's for more interesting character studies. The Gold Coast is a beautiful place. This book does the region no justice."
3,I just wasn't 'right' for this book.,"Make no mistake. DeMille is a wonderful author. He can turn phrases like no other. But I never suspected he could write a book that was so different than my beloved 'John Corey' sagas. I found this book beyond tedious steeped in architecture, history, etal - just something 'I' am not interested in. I did find the evil character beyond amusing and although I was tempted to just ditch going further in the book - I kept at it because of him. Unfortunately I found the ending and overall premise of the tragic character's demise quite depressing. I've re-read my corey books but I'll never go back to this one. Just not my 'cup of tea'."
3,Good read but could have been better,"Mafia Don moves into the place next door... Interesting idea that didn't have the bang I expected. I reserve 5 stars for a book to remember, 4 stars for a book worth hard cover price, 3 stars for a paperback, 2 stars for library and 1 star for not worth the toilet paper. This book is a 3 star at best. I wouldn't spend more than $8 ."
1,Boring - I couldn't wait for it to end,"While I have considered Nelson DeMille one of my favorite authors for years, I was incredibly disappointed with this book. There's not much of a plot and, while the main character is laugh-out-loud funny and sarcastic, the story, told as a narrative, misses a lot. Why is the Don so appealing to John & Susan? Why did what happened at the end happen? I just couldn't see it. Also, there's way too much description of places and history - so much so that my eyes tended to glaze over. Half way through the book (over 300 pages, at the halfway point), we had just gotten through introductions of the masses of people and into the basic ""plot"" of the story. Maybe that was my problem - there was no plot. I'm used to DeMille's books going somewhere - but this was much different. I'm so disappointed I don't know if I want to crack into the 3 other DeMille books that I haven't read yet."
2,Struggled to complete,Probably a case of not my Genre but I struggled to stay with this book and did not end up completing it.
2,It was just okay.,It did hold my interest for the most part but it gave me a headache. I t seemed to ramble a bit for me.
2,Not Interesting Enough,"This departure from Nelson DeMille's usual subject was disappointing for me. I didn't think that any of the characters rang particularly true. If you spend time in neighborhoods such as the famous Gold Coast, you know that neighbors, especially next door neighbors, usually go out of their way NOT to get to know one another until they've met at some club. Certainly a nice couple like the Sutters, from an old family, would have nothing to do with a notorious mafia chief. Good grief! Another secret of these type of people is that they spend a lot more time secretly or not-so-secretly working, which John Sutter, lawyer, hardly seems to do. I didn't finish it because I found another Nelson DeMille in my local library to read instead. Suggest anyone else do the same."
2,I can hardly believe Demille actually wrote this book!!! What a sleeper...,"This book was very difficult to get through. The first 150 pages were a complete waste of time, which is why it took me 3 separate times to finally get through the book. Don't discount Demille's books because of one bad one. He's still one of my favorite authors. If you haven't read any of Demille's books, then stay clear of this one. It's his worst yet. If you're looking to try out his books, I would recommend the following books, which are also my all time favorites: Charm School, The Lion's Game, Word of Honor, and Night Fall."
5,A Genius,"Honest to God, campers, if you don't like this book, what a miserable human being you must be. This is the kind of rich, nuanced work that many great authors can write just once in a lifetime -- how DeMille knocks them out every 18 months is beyond me. This is like Bonfire of the Vanities for grownups -- real wit instead of verbal jumping jacks, real insight instead of sociological blather. This book touches all the bases of what a great work of fiction should be: atmospheric, resonant, funny, tragic, poignant, lots of action-without-consequences, yet not so much of it that the reader suspends his willing disbelief. The protagonist, John Sutter, has a midlife crisis, but he has it with balls and panache instead of loads of whiny reflection. You can't go wrong with any of DeMille's books, but this one is simply great."
5,Wow!,Thoroughly enjoyable! Nelson DeMille's best book! I don't think he'll ever be able to top it and I've read them all!
5,DeMille at his Best!,"This is a fantastic first-person account of two lives crossing: a gangster and a long island WASP (even worse than the kind we have in Chestnut Hill). Narrator is sickly funny. PLotting is tight and fast, though it's long. Demille sets the standard for first-person narration!"
4,Wonderful,"While I have enjoyed all of Nelson DeMilles books; This will be one of my favorites. As always, his characters are strong, the settings vivid. Couldn't put it down.If you enjoy gaining insight to how others live, you will enjoy ""The Gold Coast""."
5,A passionate and suspenseful story,"The ""Gold Coast"" is that stretch along the northern shore of Long Island where once America's wealth and power had been concentrated. It's also where Wall Street lawyer John Sutter is holding onto a fading aristocratic legacy and Mafia don Frank Bellarosa is establishing himself. The two men collide in a passionate and suspenseful story of friendship, seduction, love, betrayal, and violence. Very highly recommended for community library audiobook collections, The Gold Coast is dramatically narrated by Scott Brick."
5,My favorite Demille; by the author of PRESSURE POINTS,"I've read 'em all, and loved them all with varing levels of passion. This was my second Demille read, and my favorite because of the narrative tone. Just when you thought the man only wrote about Vietnam and CID stuff, here's something completely fresh. I've heard from other Demille readers that this one didn't click with them... to each her/his own, I guess, but what's not to like? It'll make you laugh (nobody argues that), and it's suspenseful in a this-could-be-you sort of way. Check it out -- if you read for entertainment, then you won't be disappointed."
5,Read it,"Save this book for a long weekend. Once you get into it, you won't be able to put it down. If you want a real page-turner with a perplexing storyline and wonderfully complex characters, pick this up. I read this book several months ago, but even now I sometimes think about it. The ending is so unexpected."
3,Interesting,"This is one of thw writers earlier books and was found to be superior to his more recent work. John and Susan Sutter are living on the Gold Coast of New York State, an area known for its well known families and OLD MONEY. We are talking about the Astors, Vandebilts and Roosevelts. All is progressing well until a wealthy Mafioso Don moves next door and begins a relationship with the Sutters. The area is decribed well and the characters are richly characterized by the writer. This is an excellent book about existing power struggles as well as human relationships on various levels. It is a complex book and does tend to drag at certain points. The author is most skillful in havin put together a good, although not great read."
2,Disappointing and boring,"I must agree with C. Wickert's review. I, too, am a great fan of DeMille's novels. In fact, ""The Gold Coast"" was the only novel I hadn't read. I was very disappointed with it. The plot was thin, the characters two dimensional and tedious, and the pace was so excruciatingly slow, I had to force myself to finish the book. The so-called ""climax"" was so predictable that I had figured out what would happen 100 pages earlier. This book was WAY below the standards set by Mr. DeMille's other novels. But I suppose good writers can sometimes write bad books."
1,A great resource for one-liners.,"Portions of this book were very enjoyable because of the imaginative writing style of Mr. Demille. But the characters were not imaginative and the story not credible. So, overall, the book fell flat for me."
1,Surprised at condition of Gold Coast,"I recently purchased a copy of The Gold Coast and was happy to receive it quickly as stated on the delivery schedule. But when I received it I was a bit surprised that the entire book had old and yellowed pages.It reminded me of a book I could have gotten for 50 cents at a yard sale rather than one that I had paid $6.00 plus the shipping to receive.Also I guess I had made a mistake in ordering, because I had thought that since this was an older book, I was receiving a hard cover rather than an old paperback. I was disappointed but DeMille is lots of fun to read."
1,The Gold Coast,Difficult to review since I have not received this book yet!!!My review would have to be ZERo satisfaction
2,not the greatest,The book takes too long to get going. not in the same vein as all the other Nelson De Mille Books.
5,Gold Coast by Nelson DeMille,"I have not read any book authored by Nelson Demille that I have not thoroughly enjoyed including Gold Coast. The ""star"" of Gold Coast, John Sutter's dialogue and conduct is more or less just like John Corey in his other books with a great sense of humor and a funny way of putting things yet with a fairly serious meaning behind the humor. I highly recommend DeMille's books, all of them, but especially Mayday, The Lion, and the Lion's Game (plus Gold Coast)."
4,Interesting & funny novel,Have read a previous Nelson deMille book before and this one is totally different than the previous book I read.Enjoyable readWill recommend this book.
2,Love DeMille hated this book,I am only about 1/2 the way thru this book and it is really boring. I love Nelson Demille's John Corey series but this isn't even close. Some may like it though just not my thing
5,A Real Treat,"I couldn't wait to get home from work every night just so that I could treat myself to this book. Mr. DeMille's sense of irony combined with his wry humor and gift for writing dialogue make this one of the most exciting books I've read in many a month. This book is so good, I really do feel like I'm eavesdropping and spying on the Sutters and Bellarosas. Awesome. I just went out and bought all of Nelson DeMille's other books."
3,Had great expectations but was let down,"Given the almost 5 star rating and having read several of his other books, I expected this to be a worthwhile read. The book was too long and took to long to get started. When it did, the characters that were defined at length were unlikeable and were not impressive. The story started and ended shallow. I wanted to read the sequel, The Gate House, but I don't think I can take another 500 pages of these characters. Given the reviews on that book, I can understand why."
2,Slow and not one of Demille's best,"I usually give a book about 25 pages to get me hooked. This one didn't make it past page 20. I usually like Demille's work from Night Passage, to Wild Fire most of them are a good read. This one I found read like something out of Harlequin romances. The story was way to slow. Action almost nill. I see that some people liked it toward the middle. There are a lot of great authors which I can read so don't have the time to slug my way through a book that doesn't move."
2,BORING,"I like to finish books that I start. I haven't quite finished this one yet, and I'm having a REALLY hard time getting through it. I keep waiting for something to happen. I'm about 3/4 of the way thru it and nothing yet. This is a really boring book and nothing like Plum Island. I wish I had read the 1 star reviews before I purchased it."
2,Below Par,"Normally I'm a big fan of deMille, owning all his other books. But for me this one was definitely not up to standard. The plot is as predictable as the characters. What happens when old money meets nouveau riche? Infidelity of course. Hi hi, kiss kiss, bang bang, bye bye. It's more into Barbara Cartland territory than that of a respected thriller writer."
5,DeMille's Best....,"This is the best of all of DeMille's books. John Sutter's sarcasm and dry wit leave me laughing out loud every time I read the book. Nelson DeMille, please write a sequel!"
2,"Boring, unconvincing, and meaningless.","After about 50 pages, I started to wonder if John Sutter was going to quit making sarcastic asides. As someone once said, cynics are a dime a dozen. I didn't find Frank Bellarosa to be a seductive man, so I don't understand why John and Susan found him seductive. Ultimately, what is the book about? Is there any redemption or even any growth in the characters? The plight of Jay Gatsby is universal; how do we handle loss? This book shouldn't be compared to the Great Gatsby."
5,Outstanding and Hilarous,This is the best I have read of Nelson DeMille (and I have read several). The story is conclusive with a wrap-around ending. And it's funny - laugh out loud funny.The story is about an upper-class twit who gets entangled with a mafia chief. He doesn't realize that his background and college education have done little to prepare him for such a manipulative situation. His entire Long Island world comes crashing down. He is so ensconced in his Long Island nest that he doesn't even suspect that he has been rattling feathers in the IRS. He is a tax lawyer whose rich clients obviously want to reduce their taxation. Then the IRS goes after him - of course some of this is prompted by his new neighbour and friend - the Mafioso chieftain.Mr.DeMille has always handled dialogue and confrontation well and this book is a superb illustration of his writing. It is a wonderful comedic novel of manipulation and downfall.
5,I'm still reading the book and hope it never ends!,"I have never read a book where I laughed out loud on more than one occassion. Plot, character development, dialogue and the various settings are all masterfully done throughout the story.I think I will wait a year and read this again.You can recommend this book to anyone and they will enjoy it."
3,Blue Blood and Red Blood Do Not Mix,"This was an interesting and sometimes exciting clash between two cultures, blue blood WASPs and the Mafiaso of Italian ancestry. Told from the perspective of a cynical perspective of a wise-cracking blue blood WASP, it presents a sometimes plausible, sometimes ridiculous idea of what it would be like if the two cultures involved themselves in high drama, society, crime and sex. This was well-written, interesting, with quirky characters, and often cleverly told. There were some glitches in areas of ethics and legalities, but they did not spoil the story.Ultimately, however, the story failed to deliver a message or reasonable conclusion, but the writer appeared to drive the ending rather than allowing his characters to do so."
1,I only finished this book for one reason...,"I finish every book I start. This book was sooooo hard to get through. I found myself wondering what the point of the book was. It took forever to figure out where it was going - and by that time I was almost finished! The book is filled with DeMille's witty, sarcastic humor...and that was its only saving grace. I was sorely disappointed with this book, especially after reading Plum Island and Mayday. Get one of those instead."
2,Slow paced book. It took more than a month to finish.,"Although the life through the eyes of a middle aged tax attorney was somewhat entertaining, the story plot in this book seemed a bit too slow. This story is used to portray the differences between cultures and people that are caught between the boundaries of these cultures; interesting points are brought out about Italians, the mafia and a high society neighborhood on the east coast. The two shall never meet in the middle. Nelson Demille should clearly stick to spy novels as this book clearly demonstrates that Italian Mob history is not his forte."
3,North Shore L.I.,It an entertaining novel. Not exactly a DeMille thriller but a good read. It helps if you know something about the area of L.I. beforehand so you identify with the life style and communities. John Sutter has a good sense of humor which helps.
4,"Great idea, well executed","I can't believe I didn't read this book until 2012. Demille hits a home run with this novel. The idea itself, a gangster moving into a wealthy neighborhood, presents instant conflict. I couldn't help think of Tony Soprano, though Demille's character predated the TV protagonist. But what makes this book remarkable for me is the narrator and Demille's use of the first person. The wit and humor, the observations, the sly cynicism of a materialistic age now decaying... the perfect choice for the voice of this story. Though some scenes are long and drawn out and the book runs long (the hints of infidelity take forever to develop when we already guess they are coming), it is hard to put this book down. I'm glad Demille wrote a sequel, which I will pick up next. Not many books have such a distinctive voice that they stay with you - this is one of them."
1,Disappointment,"We've got the stroller, and found that it doesn't offer a lot of shade, even at the $800 price tag, so we put down another 50 for the umbrella, and it's awful. We don't even attempt to use it because it is too difficult to position in a way that shields the sun. You're better off getting a sun shade that ties to the top of the stroller."
4,Rhoda's so cool.,"I'm biased when I rate this series because it's nostalgic for me. I was a little kid when these first aired so even hearing the intro song takes me back. Yeah, not all of the episodes are great and I think Joe is a dud but I love the Rhoda and Brenda team and the extra characters like Gary and Sally. I'd rather watch this show over what's on t.v. these days."
5,la la la lala,just about time to lose joe isn't it? valerie was right...should have left rhoda single but the show is addictive
3,That crazy Rhoda & Brenda,"I loved Rhoda since she appeared on The Mary Tyler Moore Show, when they gave hera spin-off series it was great. The show had humor and serious moments made it fun and a family show. I miss Rhonda Morganstern!"
4,Good performer,"I got this phone to replace a 900 MHz unit that died. Generally, I am pleased with the performance. I've taken it several houses away, with good results. My only real complaint is that it cannot be used when the microwave oven is on. I do not know if this is a problem with all 2.4 GHz phones."
2,It Must Be My Job,"Overall, the book is full of not so interesting background information rather than useful tip for weight loss. I travel 100% of the work week. I live in hotels and eat in restuarants except for the weekends. This book was not particularly helpful to me."
5,Representation in Ethnography by John Van Maanen,Van Maanen has been a favourite read of mine. I now own three of his works and citehim regularly in my PhD studies of autoethnographic nursing issues.
1,Poorly designed,"Well I got it to work, eventually. It comes with a flimsy little screw that will not accept a screwdriver. The screw therefore cannot be tightened and the lamp shade wobbles pitifully. Luckily, the screw is so poorly made that it eventually slips through the opening of the metal plate and then you can replace it with a regular screw from a hardware store. What should have been a 5 minute job took at least 1 hour, including the trip to the hardware store. Also, it would be nice if this item included a simple finial."
1,Flimsy,This is a pretty flemsy adapter. It will not support much more than a very small light shade and mine actually broke when I attempted to attach it to a bulb.
3,Just as pictured- kind of annoying,"It's a bulb adapter, nothing fancy. You get exactly what's pictured which for me didn't work out with my bedside lamp. It's too thin to hold much weight so you can really only use it with tiny lampshades. My normal sized cloth one was too heavy for it. Also I thought it was kind of annoying that it didn't come with the corresponding nut for the screw/bolt part. I realize some people might use those topper thingies but if I'm missing the adapter, I probably would have lost that part too right? I tried it with a spare nut from my toolbox but of course it looked funny since it was silver (like most nuts)and this was gold colored. So I guess it was probably fine that I didn't keep using it. Next time, I won't cheap out and I'll drag my butt to the hardware store. Live and learn I guess."
3,Not as strong as expected,"It may because I was just asking too much of it it hold up the drum lampshade but no matter how tightly I clipped it, it would slip down. Almost ended up bending my shade a couple times. Just fixed the harp itself - not worth saving $3 if the $40 lamp shade gets damaged."
3,Reader&#65533;s Digest version,"This book is a no nonsense retelling of the Princess and the Pea. It is told very simply, with few details or humor. The pictures are fine, but not particularly exciting. The story is calm, and not scary. The book is printed in a sans serif font, easy to read for beginners. It's a short book, with only about 350 words."
2,Not a pleasant book at all.,"Compared to other Java books I have used, I find this one rather poor in comparison. The program examples are not helpful at all unless you are trying to create an exact copy of their program. The diagrams are not helpful, there is a lack of color. Also, the binding on this book is not secure. I purchased this book new and just about everyone in my class complains that theirs is falling apart as well. For the price, this book is not worth it."
4,A good resource for infertility patients.,"This book contains a wealth of information, written in a very detailed manner. Because of all the details and specifics, however, it is a little difficult to read. I suggest it as a resource book, but not one that you are likely to read from cover to cover."
3,Informative but incomplete,"I liked the optimism of this book and Dr. Silber's advocacy of an aggressive approach to treatment, but I wouldn't say this is a comprehensive book because it doesn't really address the emotional/psychological aspects of infertility and its treatment. Plus, Dr. Silber's self-aggrandizing tone was suprising and distracting in a book that is supposed to be about helping others, not self-promotion."
5,Excellent.,"This is a comprehensive reference book on the entire topic of infertility, written in an understandable and optimistic tone. The best of the doctor books available.Fern Reiss, author of ""The Infertility Diet: Get Pregnant and Prevent Miscarriage"""
2,He's a urologist,"A urologist by training, Dr. Silber is not trained as a reproductive endocrinologist, making his techniques very technology oriented as he is not trained in reproduction, only reproduction technologies. He would do better to stop promoting technology as the answer to reproduction (quite a money-maker for the doctors involved) and stick to doing reversing vasectomies as he was trained to do. While he offers alot of good technical info the book is utterly lacking in medical and surgical treatment options, something he apparently doesn't believe in. The medical evidence points to better results and better health for mother and babies when medical/surgical intervention is used--lower reimbursement but much better for everyone involved except centers that promote IVF and tech based medicine."
1,"Flattering for QR, but PAINFUL to listen to!","It's flattering that QR is so well loved that tributes are warranted. However, anyone who has heard some bar-band or other ""butcher"" a 'ryche song knows how painful it is to hear a poor imitation of the real thing. There are just some things that one does not mess with...this band is one of them. It was brave of the bands to attempt the challenging musical material that is trademark QR, but they would do better to concentrate on original material. Sorry!"
2,"I think that it is great, but it's not Geoff","I think that it is good someone is finally giving Queensryche the credit they deserve, BUT none of these songs even come close to the power of Geoff's voice. I seen Queensryche in concert, back in 95', it was the best experience in my life. Geoff Tate's vocals were awesome! If you are a true Queensryche fan you will either love it for the songs, words, etc, or you will hate it, like me, because it's not them!"
3,works well but can be difficult to use,I love the color and the simplicity but while working out it can be difficult to get to. Other than that great product
5,exactly right,I was looking for more than a spirometer. I wanted to increase my lung capacity in a measurable way. I could not afford a large investment but was leery of something so affordable. I have been using this exerciser and have noticed no loss of function with the design or manufacture over time. It is easy to understand and easy to use - especially if you are checking your lung volume throughout the day and various activities.
2,Product is different then description,"I purchased 2 Voldyne Volumetric Incentive Spirometer 5000ML each $8.42 and I received a little cylinder with a red ball and a mouth piece. I posted a picture for everyone to see. This is not what the description says for this I give 2 stars. I wanted the one from picture, since I don't know what I am doing and there is no chart to help just a piece of paper that tells how to use it and a short explanation what is used for. This one advice you to account seconds and multiply the number above with the seconds. Should I inhale or should I count? I don't know what to do first lol."
2,only for INhalation,this device may work but not if you want to improve your Exhalation for singing or playing the trumpet. Unfortunately the description doesn't show any information for Exhalation
1,way too hard to use,i was given one of these to use in the hospital after my recent lung surgery. it wasn't half as challenging as this is. i can't even use it.
4,Classic & Beautiful!,"A great faucet...the classic white ceramic handles add a nice touch. We are renovating a barn into a house and this was the perfect mix of new, polished chrome and the old school look with the handles"
4,Not the best tasting cod liver oil out there!,"Although my field study is small (my 4 girls), all indicated that this CLO is not anywhere near as tasty as their usual oil - Carlson Labs lemon-flavored CLO. They grudgingly eat up the Carlson oil with a lot of theatrics and bribing (chocolate, etc), but they dry-heave and just plain refuse to eat this stuff. I think it's fine but you *can* taste a hint of fishy flavor where there is none in the Carlson product. Your mileage may vary."
2,Messy,I found this product messy to use (drips all over the bottle). As far as performance of the product I could not say since I stopped due to messy issue.
5,Changing the Shape of Religious Education!,"This book is the cornerstone of a program called the Catechesis of the Good Shepherd and it is a new way to tap into the private relationship that children have with God. This book is translated from Italian and requires careful reading, but Sofia Cavelletti's message is profound. In learning how to teach 3-6 year old children using Sofia's method, I have been transformed.Sofia Cavalletti picks up where Maria Montessori began. We learn about Cultivating the Gift of Wonder, and how to engage children in such a way that they show us who God might be. I encourage every parent who wonders ""How do I teach my child about God?"" to read this book and to explore this method."
2,good for a plane ride,"I took this book with me on the plane, because i had read 'can you keep a secret?' (which i also reviewed, though more favourably than this) it really is chick lit, and although those of you might get a bit technical about how it inaccurately portrays a lawyer, it does the job of allowing you a bit of fluff and as you pass from one stereotypical character to another, amidst the illogical strands of the plot, time whizzes by. personally kinsella should stick to what she knows best, shopping. nonetheless nobody buys this book with the intention of a high brow literatzi novel do they?"
1,Silly and unrealistic,"I could tell by the title, and just reading a few pages confirmed, that this book was pretty ""fluffy."" However as I progressed I found that the premise is more than just fluffy it's completely ridiculous and insulting. By the time I got 80% thru the book (Kindle edition), I couldn't bring myself to read one more word. Just horrible!"
3,Not as good as the Shopaholic series,"I bought this book because I had lots of fun reading all 4 shopaholic books. I was expecting as much fun as I had with the others, but unfortunatelly it wasn't the case. It's a fun light book to read but not an unforgettable one!"
5,Kinsella's Best So Far,"I thought her ""Shopaholic"" books were good - but this one has ""grown up"" and blows them out of the water! A fantastic concept for a book, the storyline is engrossing and wonderful. You will love the heroine, Samantha Sweeting, who learns a valuable lesson much sooner in life than most people - a chance to know what's really important. Laugh-out-loud funny too, Kinsella has not lost her wonderful sense of humor that is present in every book she writes. Please hurry with the next novel, Sophie, we're waiting!"
4,"If you liked the Shopaholic series, you will like this...","Another cute, silly story from Sophie Kinsella. The main character, Samantha Sweeting, has the same quirky personality as Becky Bloomwood in the Shopaholic books. Fast and fun read. If you're looking for a thoughtful book, this is not the book for you. However, if you are looking for a quick, no-brainer, look no further!"
3,Entertaining but a bit bare,"I just finished reading The Undomestic Goddess. It had to be one of the fastest books I have ever read.I liked Samantha's character and learning more about her (she's very likeable), but found the story to be a bit too simple. There wasn't enough plot or character development for my taste. Perhaps that's why I read it so quickly. We barely learned anything about Nathaniel, and we have no idea what happened to Arnold or what exactly the scandal was.I really enjoyed Kinsella's Shopaholic books, so I'm surprised this book came after them, because she seemed to do very well at developing her characters in the other books.Overall, it's an enjoyable read."
4,Great Summer Light Read,"Charming book, will laugh often. The plot is a little unplausible but funny. I can see Renee Zellweiger playing in the movie. Whenever I read these books that take place in England, I become delighted with their vocabulary.........words like bullocks, nickers (panties) and the wonderful adjective that even men use, 'lovely.' Another book in a similar genre but not British is 'Match Me If You Can' by Susan Elizabeth Phillips. Another wonderful book to take to the beach."
3,No way near as charming as the Shopaholic series or Can You Keep a Secret,"As I write this review, I really don't recall the heroine's name, but I guess that shows how much I valued this novel. I am such a fan of the Shopaholic books and I really died laughing at Can You Keep a Secret, that I practically knew to expect a neurotic character, but this was so disappointing. The formula was there, but it didn't pack a punch or have the normal humor of SK's books. It's a readable book, but be prepared to be let down somewhat.Oh, and there's no way in HADES that I would turn down partnership in order to live as a maid--not after I busted my butt to get there. You earned it, you take it. Period."
4,Loved it!,"I bought this book off of the bargain table...I was wonderfully surprised...it is a great quick and easy read. I couldn't put it down. If you like ""chick books"" this one is for you!"
4,Enjoyable fun read,"I enjoyed The Undomestic Goddess. It was a very pleasant read: well-written, good plot though somewhat predicatble. The first part was the most fun for me as nobody does things going pear-shaped like Kinsella. I especially loved some of the first domestic attempts described. If you want some light and fun reading, this is your book!"
3,Not bad at all (3 and 1/2 stars),"You know, i started reading this just after reading Melissa Nathan's 'The Nanny'. Both books have similar plotlines - Girl leaves regular life to work serving a family (one as a nanny and one as a housekeeper.)I didnt like the Nanny at all. It's was quite horrible. But 'The Undmoestic Godess' was a refreshing change after Melissa Nathan's fiasco. The book is much smarter, much funier and much more enjoyable than Nathan's. The characters are more likable and you can sympathise with them. It's intelligent yet fluffy and is good for a bit of light reading.Not the kind of book you can read again and again, but i'd reccommend it anyway."
5,Cute and Entertaining!,"This is an adorable light read. I have been waiting for this novel to be published and ready to read, and I have not been dissapointed. It's light, entertaining, and fun to zip through. (I read it non-stop in a day). I highly recommend this novel! Have fun!"
