3,A romance novel written by a philosopher...,"The first 40 pages are slow, but it is hard to put the book down once you get to know the characters, if only for the reason that you get to know them more than they know themselves.This is an analytical love story. I felt like I was reading the novel and the cliff notes at the same time. The characters are presented and then analyzed by a narrator/psychologist. The analyses of characters are clever descriptions of nuances of the human spirit, such as how a character trait can abstract itself elsewhere in someone's life (Ray Porter's logic and efficiency), and the lead weights and mental disassociation of depression (experienced by Mirabelle).I laughed out loud on pages 44, 48, 56, 60, 63, 83, 88, 101, 106, 111, 113, and 120, mostly at Steve Martin's comedic insight and observations. The book was a good, quick read, but more like a slice of life than a narrative. Potential story lines were sacrificed in order to tie the novella up quickly in the end."
5,Shop Girl,"This story was touching, poignant and uterally delightful. Steve Martin completely described this young woman's fragility and her determination to have better life. His role was captivating as he wanted it all with no commitment yet he was drawn into a real relationship. Kudos, Kudos, Kudos!"
4,Good book,"I didn't know what to expect from this novella at first. I had borrowed it from a friend because we were going to see the movie together. I must admit, I was enthralled by this novella.Steve Martin does an excellent job setting up the characters and setting with deep detail from finish to end. Everything from the descriptions of Mirabelle's apartment and medication, to Porter's thought process for his software creation is written with amazing detail. Even more interesting is how Steve Martin creates and delves into the thought process of each of the characters which allowed me to empathize with the characters on the page. Moments from deep misunderstandings in a relationship, to genuine care seemed plausible as text on the page.Overall, the book is very well paced. While I am somewhat disappointed by the ending, which seemed to send the story to an abrupt halt, this was a very enjoyable read."
3,"Short and basic, but entertaining","Not the greatest read, but good summer/plane reading. I didn't find the characters too deep, and I found the storyline to be somewhat predictable. But I enjoy Steve Martin's diverse talent and would lend this book to anyone who requested it."
2,Bland Shopgirl in a Bland Novella,"I bought ""Shopgirl"" because I really really like Martin's other Novella ""The Pleasure of My Company"". I found Shopgirl to be mediocre compared to the other book, and it just kind of left me feeling ""eh!"" I like Martin's style, his witty humor, and his observations about daily life, but the ending left a lot to be desired. There was such a build-up to what would ultimately come of Ray and Mirabelle's relationship, and the resolution is thrown into 5 or 6 pages. I would have liked to know more.If you're thinking about getting ""Shopgirl"", opt for ""The Pleasure of My Company"" instead."
3,Nearly Dumbstruck,I read this book over 2 successive lunch hours. I have this incredibly overwhelming sense of sadness after finishing it. I do not recommend this to anyone in a vulnerable place -- it took me down down down.
4,A good first step into the literary world,"Sad and sometimes funny, this semi-autobiographical novella by Steve Martin (yes, THAT Steve Martin) is actually very good. The book focuses more on the female protagonist, and not the older man (Martin). The older man comes off a bit pushy, a bit needy, a bit mean, which is surprising, but he comes off very, very real because of it.A very interesting book of (somewhat) fiction from a comedian - a good first step into the literary world."
4,A pleasant surprise.,I had this book for a long time just sitting on a shelf. I read it when I was out of books to read. I was surprised and really enjoyed it.
2,"Weak, weak, weak","I'm not saying that if Steve Martin were not Steve Martin, this book would not have been published. It's not THAT bad. But if Steve Martin were not Steve Martin, I am quite sure that nobody would ever, ever have heard of it. It's a middling and pleasant book but still, there is nothing remotely special about it. Too bad."
2,An old man's fantasy,"Similar to his play, Picasso at the Lapine Agile, Steve Martin believes he knows more about people and their inner psyches than he really does. The heroine is only ""beautiful"" because she is non threatening and submissive. It seemed as if Martin was implicitly describing his dreamgirl and himself as the oh so complicated Ray Porter. Their relationship is labeled as the older man/younger woman scenario, but age has nothing to do with it. Were the characters more real and three dimensional, this would be a story about two people from separate classes, not age groups. Add the one dimensional characters Lisa, Jeremy, and Mirabelle's parents, the story is wanting and leaves a bad taste in the mouth of anyone hoping to gain some useful insight into the complicated relationships we all sometimes share."
3,"Some fantastic lines, but lacking some oomph","Giving only three stars to a book that took less than an afternoon to read -- and so didn't impose upon my time the way a really horrible 800-pager would -- is hard to reconcile. And although Steve Martin's latest work contains some great passages, excellent insights into the characters he creates, it's missing something that I can't quite put my finger on. I can say with near certainty that, upon finishing this book, you won't feel the time spent reading it was a waste. But you'll probably walk away with a bad taste in your mouth, wishing there had been more, or that what was there had been better."
2,I Like Steve Martin But I Didn't Like This Book,"Older rich guy is attracted to young beautiful depressed girl. Treats her to his lifestyle. She thinks he cares about her, falls in love. He is just using her, she gets hurt. What a depressing story. And what is with Mirabelle's jealous co-worker shaving her pubic hair by rinsing her razor in the toilet? Is this just to point out how gross and unattractive she is on the inside, and undeserving of the attentions of the very selective Ray Porter? Basically an empty, heartless, meandering story. Can't recommend."
4,"Eloquent, Sensitive, Beautiful","I never knew Martin could write so beautifully! As others have noted, in this work he flaunts his extensive vocabulary and brilliant use of the English language in a way that completely shocked me. His sensitivity and tenderness are very impressive. Throughout the book I thought, ""how can a man possibly write with such feminine insight?"". But it really works for him.It was refreshing to examine characters in such raw depth... to explore their inner motivations and fears. And best of all, while the tone is primarily melancholy, the ending is sweet and touching, but still realistic. The characters are able to grow as individuals and take their relationships to a higher level."
4,a great little novella for a trip to vegas,"Who would have thought Steve Martin would have such insight into the world of women...He writes with a gentleness and a keen eye. I read Shopgirl while lying by the pool in Vegas, and read excerpts to my husband who seemed to enjoy it almost as me!!!I have lent it to girlfriends who were all very impressed and shocked it came from funny man, Steve Martin! What a wonderful new writer."
5,A Sweet & Wry Novella,"I'm a huge fan of Steve Martin, so when I started reading this book I was put off balance by how un-wacky it is. It's tone matches LA Story or Bowfinger (the writing), but it is much more serious. Although there are some very funny observations and amusing situations, it's a serious book, in that it talks about flawed adults navigating a ""real world"" romantic landscape.I'm not sure what else I can say about the book without giving away some surprises. It's a short, yet compelling read and I find myself thinking about it still, many days after I finished reading it."
3,Olive Oyl,"When Steve used this image for his protagonist, I got stuck. From that point on, all subtlety of character and plot subordinated to her saying, ""Popeye!"" in a whining tone.I could not empathize with her. I could not feel her pain.And I kept waiting for Bluto to show up.I wish I could do a ""spotless mind"" thing and get that image out of my head. Then I could enjoy the book..."
2,was hoping for more,I had a hard time making it through this book. I had a hard time relating to the main character - I actually felt uncomfortable at times while reading the story by the references that Martin makes towards the issues of sex and lust
3,Not for me...,"Steve Martin is extremely funny. There was a lot of vulgar language in this book that I wasn't impressed with but the funny parts made up for it. All in all it was a good, fast read."
1,AHHHHH,"I picked this book up because the cover was so nice.Great cover, horrible book. Do not waste your time."
1,Absolutely a boring chick-lit!,"This is definately classified as untalented chick-lit. I dont mind reading any chick-lit if it actually is meaningful and interesting. This book by the famous actor Steve Martin was terrible. This shows how poor his writing style could be.This Novella is about a woman named Mirabelle she works at a glove-compartment store in New York City and she has dreams of becoming an artist. All this book revolves around is her love triangle between the wealthy-businessman Ray Porter-who is a classified as a player and the junkie Jeremy. All it centers around is her love-life and how she gets over it-how original. I read this in one day on a plane ride to Detroit and I got so bored with it. Its amazing to see how stupid this book is.I dont really know how Steve Martin got away with writing this book, just because he's famous he can get a writing deal, its not worthing even borrowing from a library, there's nothing to it."
4,Everyone knows characters like these in real life,"This book was easy reading. When I first bought it I thought it was going to be funny because of the author, but I was pleasantly surprised. This book I thought was warm and touching. I felt like I knew the characters personaly. It was as if you got a chance to see inside the thoughts of someone you once cared about and could not understand. I really enjoyed the book, it had humorous sex scenes, down to earth characters with real life problems, and modern-day tragic romances."
4,"A little weird, a little beautiful...","This little book captured me and never let me go until the end. Steve Martin entertains us with the story of a young girl's odd relationship with an older man, while making us painfully aware of all the psychological inner workings and thought patterns experienced by the characters in the book..not a single one is without real problems. The language in this little gem is very harsh, and I tired of the four letter word, ""f**k"". Steven seems to enjoy that word. An interesting book, especially for those of us that are a little weird ourselves!"
4,Ambivalence all around,"While I many of the insights into relationships (expectations v. reality) truly stellar, my overall impression of Shopgirl is one of unease and incompleteness. Perhaps that's the irony Martin was going for--do we ever really know ourselves or others?Mirabelle and Ray are wonderfully drawn characters both physically as well as emotionally. Mirabelle's parents, Jeremy, and the loathsome Lisa however, seem to exist on the surface only (though Lisa and Jeremy's tryst was great farce). Jeremy's transformation seemed especially artificial.One last observation, Martin captured depression perfectly when during a depressive episode, Ray asked Mirabelle how she was. She answered, ""Pretty okay."" Oh!"
4,sweet and tender,"I was skeptical but could not resist to pick up this book, and I am really glad i did. it was an easy read but not without substance. intelligent writing mixed with tender insights and forgiveness. a great read."
2,At least it's short.,"I love Steve Martin, but I was thoroughly disappointed with this recent work. I would have put the book down shortly after I began reading it, but I was avoiding writing a long academic paper. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure that my choice to continue reading the book was the least painful one. Still, I gave this book an extra star for being short (it's a one-day read).Perhaps my criticism is due to a deep hatred of romance-type novels. Additionally, I expected a bit more comedy from Steve. Regardless of the reasons, though, it stunk."
4,Fun quick read!,"Sex. Immaturity. Shallowness. Vulnerability. Fear. Betrayal. Committment. Shopgirl is a fun, quick read that covers all these aspects of relationships.You'll enjoy this book because you'll either see a little bit of your love life or certainly someone else's.You'll never walk into a store like Neiman Marcus without thinking about gloves and the Mirabelle's, Ray's, Jeremy's and Lisa's of the world!Enjoy 8^)"
5,Wow! He's a great writer too!!,"Steve Martin's first, obscure book entitled ""Cruel Shoes"" (1979) was a collection of short vignettes. It was a dark humored book and totally different from the (then) traditional Steve Martin stand-up comedy (more akin to Glen Baxter).This new book ""Shopgirl"" is another surprise! It is a truly engaging piece of literature. It stands on its own, without the author's fame. Know the author's other talents just makes the book more incredible to read & enjoy.A great comic, a great actor and now a great writer! Hopefully more work is forthcoming!"
3,Abrupt ending,"I bought Shopgirl at the airport & finished it before my plane touched down at my destination. The book's thorough & thoughtful descriptions (and especially its ""knowingness"") had me hooked immediately, but I was disappointed by the last few pages that wrapped the story up so quickly. It was a worthwhile read, but definitely lacked anything resembling a smooth, conclusive ending."
4,A good read,"A lovely tale of loneliness, lust, love, friendship and the struggle for meaningful human connection. The novella is populated with characters who falter and fall, misunderstand and are misunderstood, just get by or don't even try, but in the end somehow scrape up enough self-belief to steer their lives along a more satisfying path.Martin's nimble, thoughtful writing is dotted with unexpectedly funny descriptions - unexpected despite knowing he is a comedian because they ambush the reader in mid-narrative with incisive, knowing clarity.A good read."
1,Don't waste your money,This book is so horrible there are no words. It's the first time I had to force myself to finish a book. It's crass to say the least. Don't waste your money on this book. I love Steve Martins films but his writing leaves much to be desired.
1,"Where have you gone, LA Story?","I usually adore Steve Martin's work, such as with Picasso at the Lapin Agile and LA Story. He left me deeply disappointed with Shopgirl. The plot is very simplistic, the characters' motivations sketchy, and it just seemed he did not put the usual amount of thought into this novella as he has done in other writings. It also seemed to me that Martin focused more on describing sex scenes and making references to genitalia than any other aspect of the book. Then again, perhaps this is why it was a best seller."
3,Fast read but disappointing,"I liked the basic story of a person's life and relationships coming full circle, but I found it to be to wordy and descriptive. Some of the terminology just completely went over my head. It's not a book that you would want to pick up and read if you want something light and breeze. Even though it is a short story and can be read in a very short period of time."
2,Slow,"This one reads more like a screen play than a novel (the film is actually being released soon). The story is a boy meets girl tale where Mirabelle, a young artist and clerk at Neiman Marcus in Los Angeles is courted by an older wealthy professional (Ray Porter) and a young slacker (Jeremy). The narrator recounts Mirabelle's meeting and early dating rituals with both guys by alternating female and male perspectives; highlighting the differences in perception between the sexes as it relates to dating. Although Jeremy is closer in age to Mirabelle he is the opposite of Ray in most every aspect. Ultimately Mirabelle must reconcile her love for the two men with what needs they satisfy. ""Shopgirl"" reminds me of the movie ""Translation"" with Bill Murray. I thought that film was boring and this written version of the same concept is not much better."
1,If you ever get to talk with Steve Martin...,"...and you're at all attractive...don't think he's smiling at your witty conversation. This twadry trifle reveals what's really on Martin's mind. This book would come across differently if written by a young woman; but when ""Mr. Happy Family Father"" of several recent family films is writing - and thinking - like this, the best word to describe it is ""gross"". (The oh-so-verbal Mr. Martin would have used a more descriptive term, but this time, the lesser word fits.)"
4,shopgirl,"I enjoyed this book tremendously, but sometimes as i was reading I thought yeah right no woman would think that."
4,Melancholy Baby,"Shop Girl is an inspired tale of self-insight. Mirabelle is a rare beauty who appreciates fine art and possesses exquisite fashion tastes. Her challenge - discovering joy within her empty soul. She attracts two lovers - Ray, a millionaire in search of a better understanding of women and himself, and Jeremy, a slouch that is not sure what or where to search. Mirabelle charms them both, and in the process all three achieve greater self-worth and peace. Author Steve Martin provides a rich fabric around the psyche that achieves an optimal balance between inspiration and under-statement. The author calls his story a `novelette', but Shop Girl will provide a more delightful satisfaction than many longer best sellers."
3,Pedestrian,"""Shopgirl"" is about a 28-year old saleswoman at a luxury department store who is seduced by a 50-year old millionaire. It is heavy and laden with detail, and Steve Martin does a good job of capturing the internal monologue of each of his major characters. But the details and the psychology -- while they ring true by themselves -- make the book itself ring false. If this book is meant to be entertaining it fails, because we fail to build an emotional connection to any of the characters. If this book is meant to enlighten it fails, because it seems so removed from our own emotional lives."
2,boring..,"Maybe it's the lack of much dialogue, but I'm having a hard time getting into this book. I started over a month ago, and am about half way through."
3,Average,I saw the movie first and I thought the book would be better but it was an average book. I actually like the movie better
2,Not too bad,"I find the explicit language a bit offensive, but the story line was good enough to keep going to the end. I liked the insight into the male/female relationship, but somehow, I knew what was coming. I borrowed it from the library, definitely not a keeper for my bookshelves."
5,"""...that's life...""","I became engrossed in this book from the moment I picked it up. While it is set in Los Angeles, I think that anyone living anywhere can relate to some part of Mirabelles's situation. I almost always find what Steve Martin does funny, but not always moving or interesting. This book took me through laughter and sadness. I compared it to my own life and I could relate on many levels. I have read reviews of this book criticizing its length, I think had it been any longer I would have lost interest. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to read a book about finding ones self."
3,Not what I expected,"Quite truthfully, I wasn't sure what to expect of a novella by the great comedian, Steve Martin. I guess I thought it would be more of a comedy, instead of a book that touches on the very real subject of depression in the character of Mirabelle. I found myself very surprised at the way the book ended, as I felt like it was steering in one direction, then veered off in another which was a great thing! I different book from what i've read before, but I was not disappointed in it."
3,"Good, but something missing","I liked the book, let's start with that. However, there was something missing. Perhaps I expected a sense of the magical that pervades the best of Steve Martin's screenplays. This book contained little humour and was filled with a lot of dry irony. It read more like a short story that had been elongated to fill the pages of a book, rather than something wonderful.All in all, not just for fans, and a good read."
2,A sad commentary on a sad culture,"Martin, who has written humorous pieces in the past, writes a droll script of a girl's sad existence. As we would expect, Martin's keen wit leads to a sharp writing style that is well suited for this short book. However, this girl is not a heroine, she is to be pitied. She obsesses over sex and possessions, an indictment of the world around us. However, Martin doesn't write of her existence as empty -- but we can see it as such. She pines for a longing touch of a caring man, but engages in casual sex as if this will fill her empty life.How many will read this book, feel sorry for Mirabella, then ignore the sad visage in their own mirror?This is not a funny book, despite Martin's humorous ability. This is a crass, even crude (language) book that I would not recommend except for those studying the reasons for our eventual soceital downfall."
2,Seriously?,"I bought this book because I like Steve Martin movies and the reviews raved about this. When I got the book, I thought it was going to be a quick read. I was wrong. It took me about a week to get through it. The writing was elementary and, well, blah - much like the characters. I was a bit confused about Mirabelle's personalty and unclear about the Dad's friend role. Also, Ray Porter was sleeping with someone who he came to think of as a daughter...?? A bit disturbing.... I never laughed, not even cracked a smile. Maybe I just don't get the dark comedy.I liked the ending because it was finally over. Sorry Steve Martin!"
3,Eh....,"This compact little novella is filled with characters who are unrealistic and hard to relate to. We are wound through a strange maze of emotions and motives and finally drawn to an unsatisfying conclusion. I've read much better, and I'm sure you have too."
3,Okay... I was expecting more humor,"This book was a quick read. It caught my eye because it was by Steve Martin, and it was not what I was expecting, nonetheless, it was entertaining. It centers around a lonely department store worker (she works in the glove department) and her new found love life with an older man... I heard they were going to make a movie out of it..."
4,Surprising!,"I'm very surprised that Mr. Martin wrote a book with a theme on the natural attraction between older men and younger women! Only Mr. Hefner and the Frenchseems to be honest about displaying this. However, I found the protagonist's insistence on being brutally honest about not wanting to be serious in the relationship extremely annoying and unrealistic. SHOPGIRL was a very interesting quick read.Katie"
3,"Grim, dark ... Sorry, Steve","A very dark little book about the rituals of dating in the 21st century. I found it difficult to relate to any of the main characters, but maybe I'm just to old to ""get it."" Mirabelle - the title character - is more to be pitied than admired. And ""Mr. Ray Porter"" seems nearly alien in the way he relates to women - a machine-like predator of sorts. While Martin tries to convey that both characters are still works-in-progress, still ""becoming,"" they don't quite reach a level where you can actually like them or identify with them. Even Mirabelle's struggle with clinical depression doesn't make her a sympathetic character. I have always liked Martin as an entertainer, and also enjoyed his recent memoir (also a bit dark in parts), but, while Martin's writing is good enough, this novella simply remained a bit too grim to be an enjoyable read. - Tim Bazzett, author of SOLDIER BOY: AT PLAY IN THE ASA"
4,Ordinary People,"""Shopgirl"" is a touching novella about ordinary people and their struggles. The two main characters, Mirabelle and Ray, enter into an unsteady relationship. Mirabelle wants to fill her empty life with love. Ray, a businessman twice her age lusts after Mirabelle and wants to pass the time with her until he finds a real girlfriend. Both of them need to mature, and the relationship helps them grow. The story is sometimes funny, and sometimes sad, but ultimately hopeful. ""Shopgirl"" is short and well-written, in a unique narrative style. It is a page turner, as you get wrapped up in the lives of the characters. It can easily be devoured in a single sitting."
4,The Quiet Beauty of Shopgirl,"The fact that Steve Martin is an icon in Hollywood and a household name to comedy is enough to make one slightly intrigued with the news that Martin had decided to pursue his literary talent with a small novella entitled Shopgirl. However, contrary to his hollywood début, Shopgirl does not contain laughably loud comedy that pushed Martin to the forefront of Hollywood's best. Yet, Shopgirl is worthy of attention and praise. Because it is a novella, rather than a novel, says something about the book itself. It presents itself with quiet mystery; in which, the main characters appear at first with vagueness while emerging slowly with grace and strength. This is seen in particularily with Mirabelle who grapples with the routines of life and the mysteries of love. Shopgirl's overall subdued beauty gives it a haunting effect that leaves a hunger for more."
3,interesting...,"While Martin's novella is engaging, I think it tries too hard to be...something. It seems that the characters are simply characters; not real people but merely suggestions of people. Jeremy, for example, is a ""typical"" slacker with his slouching, one-track mind and pitiful conversation, and dead-end job. His turnaround almost seems too much, too obvious. The same can be said for all of the characters.I think what really got to me was just that Martin spends a lot of time identifying everything, making sure we understand what he is trying to get at subtly. Near the end, we don't need him to tell us that Porter is Mirabelle's father figure. If Ray figured that out by himself, I think Martin could have had him reach that conclusion more delicately.Overall, I thought this was an entertaining read. I think that it is a good first venture into fiction for anyone, and that with more fiction writing Martin's work will become more assured."
4,Steve Martin is a prose virtuoso,"Ok, the plot in Shopgirl is contrived and flimsy. But that's not the point. The point is to showcase Steve Martin's surprising gifts: an acute eye for character and detail, and a prose style that manages to be both sharp and sweet. His characterizations are dead on. His prose ranges from the exceedingly caustic to the tender, but always hitting exactly the right note.I enjoyed his next book, The Pleasure of my Company, even more. The writing is just as good and the characters are much better."
3,Enjoyable and quick read,"Comedian Steve Martin provides a tongue-in-cheek novella that mirrors his subtle stage and screen comic personality. In Mirabelle, we have a young woman who stumbles through life while highly underestimating herself. Martin creates a believable world wherein Mirabelle, her coworkers, her love interests, and even her rival, struggle through circumstances to which many of us can relate. A quick and entertaining read for those who don't enjoy wading through books that are as thick as brick walls."
4,Awesome action,"The beginning of the movie is a bit slow and disoriented, but when the action starts, it is great. The heroine does some amazing karate/kung fu/muay tai moves that will keep you wondering how it was done. Some of the hits and falls must have hurt someone (and sure enough, the extra feature shows some of those real hurts)."
1,Blu-Ray Subtitles,"This is not a review of the movie, nor does the star rating reflect what I thought of it (it's one of my favorite martial arts films). This is in regards to the Blu-Ray disc. The picture and sound quality are great, however...The only English subtitle option offered on this disc is SDH subtitles. Meaning, that every sound effect has to be read along with the dialogue. This is especially annoying since this is an action movie with many sound effects. What makes this being the only option even worse is the fact that this is not an issue on the DVD. There is no reason the Blu-Ray should only offer SDH subtitles. Hopefully, with enough negative feedback on the subtitle option, the problem will be corrected and replacements issued."
5,An Inside Look on Happenings in body and soul,"Autism is something that is hard for people to understand, how can someone be a genius and, yet, not be able to live by themselves or be alone for any given time. There is a transformation that goes on when a person has something they know they can do but the body, mind, soul doesn't permit it to occur. This movie gives an inside look with kick ass karate action of what it takes to make that transformation, if only for a moment. It is an excellent movie and I would recommend all to see."
4,Super human little girl,Basically here is the movie: a skinny little girl beats the crap out of more guys than you could ever imagine. That's pretty much it.
5,Art,"This is how Martial Arts movies should be and I've been watching them since the 70's.Plot? Light. Action heavy.If you buy this for no other reason, the last 20 minutes rock."
4,Chocolate blu-ray,"For those of you who watch your blu-rays without a reciever or tv that enhances and filters picture, you will notice artifacts in some scenes. Bitrates are healthy but the artifacts are probably from the source and cannot be helped. I don't always trust blu-ray.com reviews(especially for this) because their setups use filters and do not always show the truth of the picture. They made ALOT of mistakes. One being ""The Universe blu-ray"" was 1080i when infact it was 1080p. It is just how the scource(mixture of old interlaced footage and new 1080p cg footage) is showned.Having said that, you will enjoy ""Chocolate"" as it has great actions scenes and some great acting from the main lead female Jeeja. When there are no articfacts(only in very little dark scenes, not to worry), the picture holds up quite well. Big upgrade from bootleg dvds and etc. Subtitle translations are just right with unoticable mistakes. Extras aren't weak but limited.A must have for fans!"
2,"clever premise, repetitive execution","**1/2Zen (the spunky JeeJa Yanin) is a young girl with a crazy kind of autism - one that makes her all but inarticulate yet gives her near-superhuman skills in the area of martial arts. When her mother, a former-gangster-turned-straight single mom, is diagnosed with cancer, Zen uses her unique fighting skills to collect all the money owed to her by a band of cutthroat criminals.""Chocolate"" is a damn silly movie at times, but there's no point in denying that there is at least some purgative and entertainment value in watching a sweet, innocent kid consistently beating the living crap out of a bunch of surly, burly bad guys - at least, that is, until the novelty wears off and monotony and redundancy become the order of the day.The martial arts sequences are exceptionally well done, but this overly repetitive Thai movie could use a little less fighting and a little more variety in its storytelling to maintain the audience's interest."
1,What a stinker,Probably the worst martial arts film ever made. Accompanied by an over dramatic SUPER annoying bratty kid that makes getting a rout canal pleasruable.Money Money Money!! Shaddap already! Didnt even get half way through. I would laugh if I wasnt crying out of misery.
4,Fun martial arts,"Enjoyable as a martial arts action movie. The stunts are excellent - you'll feel the pain. All I can fault the movie for is being too dramatic in first half then going into a ""boss fight"" that looks like it's straight from a video game. The change of pace is jarring but it's putting the movie where its talents lie."
1,D+ for effort,"I wanted to like this movie, the premise is awesome. A young special needs girl goes Bruce Lee. Totally awesome concept, but it falls short of being a watchable movie, for me. The pace, the tone, the annoying subtitles that didn't match the dubbed English. Parts of the movie made no sense to me what so ever --Again, I think the best part of the movie was the trailer.I wish there was a rent option on Amazon Moises. I felt that I spent to much.There are B Movies, but this was just a Bad Movie."
2,Girl Kicks Butt Wow... But Whats' Up with the content!!!,"This martial arts movie was full of high flying action, but thats just not enough for me. The whole selling point of the film was that now it's a female doing what was already a dieing industry. As an intructor of the martial arts I show films to my kids, however because of this films loaded content (heavy adult material) I will never show this to my friends or family, I hate I ever bought this film, it's a trick, a sham, and not worth wasting your money."
1,This sucks!,"The action scenes are good, very much like Jackie Chan's acrobatic style, but the colors and sounds and cinematography are just too low-budget quality to like. The story is too one-dimensional. There are no character developments. If you want a martial arts film that has all that, see Ichi -- that is the best martial arts film I have ever seen."
4,Expected Something Else,"The concept is fresh and interesting, but I was disappointed with the cheesy overdubbing. I heard of the film from someone who had seen it with subtitles and I believe that would have preserved more of its original character. In spite of that it was enjoyable."
4,Movie Gift,Purchased this for my mother. She was surprised at how much she turned out to really like it a whole lot.
3,"Durbin grows up, gets sexy.","Her first movie where consummation (i.e., marriage) becomes a possibility. Durbin, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, has a knack for facetious comic timing as well, the heavy-lidded, seen-it-all variety that Rosalind Russell and Barbara Stanwyck mastered. Charles Laughton tries a little too hard to be a crinkly, charming old tycoon, but he pulls it off pretty well. This late screwball comedy features the handsome pratfall Robert Cummings, but the chemistry the movie presumes to show between him and Durbin seems a little superficial if not non-existent (other than the nearly kinky pinching scene, of course). Fun and diverting overall."
1,Absolutely RUBBISH,"I am so disappointed with this video ""tutorial""... the author skips so many steps during the process of recording and for some odd reason expects you to just know all these things as if they're so simple you'd have to be an idiot not to know how to do it. He doesn't explain half the concepts for beginners such as ""what do you mean by 'sending to a bus', etc.This has to be by far one of the worst video tutorials I've ever seen. I just had to stop only after lesson 5 because the author is so boring (his tone doesn't even sound like he wants to teach).Totally not worth your time."
2,functional but not the quality I expected.,This book case will be fine for the functional need that I have but I was dispappointed with the quality. I do not expect it to last long because of the cheap materials.
5,a wonderful album,"If you like the blend of Celtic & Medieval music combined with Middle Eastern sounds, such as Loreena McKennitt's 'Marco Polo', then I highly recommend this CD to you. 'The Queen of the Sun' & 'A Chartar Mer' are my particular favourites."
4,Angels of Venice,This CD is a nice tempo...relaxing without putting you to sleep. Great background music. I will be listening to it often.
3,Interesting collection...,I liked the Angels of Venice cuts on the various Windham Hill compilation CD's. I was dissapointed that most of them were repeated here on their new album.
1,Not so good,"I'm amazed by the comments of the other listeners, as I found this album to be something of a disappointment. After a third album of such superlative quality, I must say this one completely misses the mark."
4,It work just fine,We are very satisfied with the garage door opener we purchased.We just programmed it(battery came included) and it was ready to go.
3,Average.,"Garage door opener - ugly looking but does the job. I find they last about a year then I have an issue with the button sticking and the item not functioning properly.I purchased from someone on the marketplace. It never arrived, but he gave me a refund."
5,Easy Set Up,Easy to set up and works great. I purchased this for the community gate and has a great range.
2,What is so great about Alex Cross,"I must say that this book is suspenseful and quite a pageturner. However, I was left more than a little discouraged in the end.-SPOILER ALERT- Can someone please tell me what is so great about Alex Cross? What did he do to prevent the president from being assassinated? The answer...Nothing. The president was assassinated! How did he cleverly discover the I.D. of the other murderer...the 13 yr.old. The answer...he didn't. The killer had to call him to the house for the finale. I just don't get what is so great about Cross. He failed and so did the last quarter of the book."
2,If Alex Cross tells me once more about the 'Mean Streets',"I have now read all the Alex Cross series. I don't know why I persevered. I am so sick of Alex Cross telling me how hard he is, and what his Nana would have said.The general plot of the book is good. Perhaps the author could dream up another central character. Don't get me wrong I do enjoy books where there is a central character such as Jack Reacher (Lee Child's hero), or Bob Swagger (Stephen Hunter's character). When you read a book by Hunter or Child you attach yourself to the character. I can imagine what they look like and almost how they think. With Alex Cross I don't.To sum up though- good plot shame about the fairy of a central character."
1,hated it!,"Not to demean anybody else's opinion but ..aarrgh!Trite, choppy dialogue. Chapters are two and a half pages long throughout. The main character, Alex Cross, his internal dilogue was laughably contrived. His relationship with the school principal: ludricous.The plot twists seemed to exist only because they are what is expected these days. Sometimes point ""A"" to point ""B"" is interesting enough. Stop hiding every character in suberfuge.What a waste."
5,When you are at work you can hardly wait to get home to read,"I first got hooked on ""Along Came A Spider,"" and ""Jack and Jill"" continues with the suspense technique generated in the first book. As you tire, you keep thinking...""Okay, I'll just read one more chapter"" and before you know it, it is midnight and you've read seven more chapters!"
4,Unpredictable story lines in a great murder mystery.,"Couldn't put it down on vacation. Though his chapters are short, they do separate the two story lines in the book. Excellent job keeping my interest, which is hard in a book. The story lines were good and what happened in each was unexpected which makes it interesting. Will get his other books and read them."
4,Patterson Fan,"While my favorite is Along Came a Spider and Kiss the Girls, Jack and Jill is a great book. It keeps you interested (as Patterson has a knack for doing). If you like his other books, you will certainly enjoy this one."
4,"Clever, Exciting, and Fun","What a fun book! I have found, from reading many Patterson books, that his novels have increasingly gotten more and more unpredictable and exciting. I love the way that the people that you think ""dunnit"" are the wrong people and how he makes the villains in his books people that you would never guess could do it. All of these different mediums that Patterson uses culminates in ""Jack & Jill."" I would recommend it along with all of his other books, even the early ones."
4,"Enjoyable book, but not the best I have read",Overall a good novel. The book contains two serial killer plots . . . the second one (the Truth School killer) is a bit dry and superfluous. I was hoping for more of Jack and Jill themselves. This was my first Patterson book. I enjoyed the story enough to want to read his other books.
5,Excellent Book,This book was excellent.The short chapters made it impossible to stop reading.The story also had an unexpected twist at the end which I liked. Go out and buy this now!
4,INXS,"Almost everything is just a little too excessive in this novel. I'd previously read three of his books and was most impressed by Along Came A Spider and Kiss The Girls (Hide and Seek was just an embarrassment and must have been written by someone else!). Jack and Jill is OK but Patterson just seems to over reach -there're too many plot lines, too many italicised statements (although the device works very effectively when used with discretion) and too many almost irrelevant murders eg Sumner whatsisname. But the biggest flaw was not linking the two plot lines -Patterson clearly needed the kid killer plot to make his point about ghetto life, but any first year pol sci student whould be able to make a case for linking national politics with local level poverty, so why couldn't Patterson."
5,James Patterson outdid himself on this book,"This is the first James Patterson book I have read, and it is excellent! This book enspired me to purchase Cat and Mouse, whis is also supposed to be great. I previously was a big Steven King fan, but have changed. You should as well..."
5,Jack & Jill by James Patterson,A great book for those who are interested in knowing what James Patterson is about. It is a great introduction to the author and the story was one that I could not put down after the first page!
3,Bad ending,"Many readers have commented that there was no way they could guess the ending. That's about right, since the ending makes no sense. I won't give it away, but suffice it to say that there ends up being absolutely no discernible purpose for most of the murders in the book - i.e., the murderer is not just a random psycho and yet has no motive for the murders."
3,Better than average.....,"""Jack and Jill"" was good, but it took a while for me to get into it. It seemed to stagnate in the middle, then finally did start moving again. But, let me add that when it did start moving again, it was great!"
4,Gift,The book was a gift for my grandson who has read many of the author's books and enjoys them tremendously. He listed this one as one of the better ones.
2,A subpar book,"I am finding myself a bit tired of the Alex Cross series after this, my third book. I am tired of Cross' racist mother. I am tired of some of the ridiculous superhero elements of the hero, and I am tired of some of the strange habits of the author (for example, notice how many times the characters mention each others names while speaking to one another: ""how are you Alex""? Fine John, how are you""? ""I'm great alex. What's on your mind Alex?"" ""Nothing much John. I'm thinking about Seneji again"". ""Thats too bad Alex. You should get over him Alex"" etc.). In this book, the ending is so absurd that it was nearly laughable, but by that point I was sort of expecting it. It is getting more and more difficult for me to suspend disbelief with each of these books. I may try to read the 4th, but I'm not getting my hopes up too high for it."
1,Absolute Drivel,"After hearing much about Mr. Patterson and his previous efforts, I decided to give this novel a try. To put it mildly, this book is quite hard to read. Not because the narrative is so descriptive nor because the vocabulary is so erudite, but simply because I found myself rolling my eyes so often in disbelief. Almost every aspect of this book is trivial. The plot is nonsensical, the dialogue is awkward and reminiscent of a soap opera and the characters are strerotypical at best. I became angry with this story and therefore had to put the book down. FOREVER."
2,Where did this Ego come from!,"I have read Mr.Patterson's previous books with great enjoyment...interesting characters, great plots, etc. However, I found it very difficult to even finish this book, as Alex Cross' ego seemed to want to gag me every few pages! The story line and other characters were actually very interesting, but Mr.Patterson seemed to find it necessary to hit us over the head with the fact that his main character was 'the Hero'. Continually refering to himself as the 'Dragonslayer' became very tedious. It was as though Mr.Patterson had no faith in the readers to discover the intelligence and perceptiveness of Alex Cross. Anyway, I was very disapointed, and unforunately am unable to bring myself to read his next book, in fear of his self absorbed 'hero'!"
3,Black Widow,"This is not one of my favorites. Even though it is not that well written it still kept my attention. The plot involves a singer Maggie Bradford who is on trial for the murder of Will Shepard who was famous in the athletic world. The plot thickens when it appears that she may have murdered two husbands. Is she a Black Widow? Pick it up you will like it. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
4,interesting book,i liked the suspense but didn't like so much the imagination--read a few of them and will be searching for a book not so far fetched
4,Jack & Jill (Alex Cross),A very good and fast read like most of Patterson's books. I would recomend it to those Alex Cross fans.
4,My first Alex Cross book.,"This was my first Alex Cross book, I enjoyed it very much. Kept me reading for hours. I am hooked and I just purchased the next one in the series Cat & Mouse."
3,Great Book...Kindle form full of typos,Jack and Jill is a great book...Kept me reading and in suspense! The only problem I had with this book was all the typo's! It was terrible! I wish I knew how to get started in this and I would do it myself...I think they ought to warn you it is full of typo's some left me guessing what they meant!
3,Great after you are half way through-all the spelling errors were crazy,"Good read, did not disappoint but the spelling errors throughout the book was awful. I would love to know why it is released like that. Following the two different murders and psychological analysis kept it going and helped pick up the speed. I think I'll get the next book from the library. Need a rest from all those misplaced and misspelled words."
4,Excellent Thriller,"Reading the series in order and have yet to be disappointed. If I were to rank them in order, Kiss the Girls would come first, followed closely by Jack and Jill and then Along Came a Spider. If you're new to the series, read them in order - the characters develop as you go and references are made to previous novels. Patterson has a great writing style and he has given us characters who are real and who we can enjoy. So glad I've finally started reading the Cross series."
3,Could have been better,"I have read all the Cross books.Jack and Jill in my opinion went no where.I found it to be a little slow, and never really got excited about it.To put it in perspective , I read Kiss the girls in 4 days and couldnt put it down this book was just to slow.Took me 2 months to read it because i couldnt get into it.It didnt have the energy and excitement of the other Cross books.I wouldnt say dont read it, but would save it for last."
4,Pretty good,"Not as good as the first two in the Alex Cross series, but solid nonetheless. There was much more racial tension in this one, as well as many liberal beliefs expressed, which I didn't care for. Decent read overall."
3,Its give you thrills...but nothing more,"Maybe its because i listened to the Audiobook...i dont know but I didnt get the thrill of an ""Alex Cross Novel"" from this book. It lacked something...the plot was there...so was the action...maybe it came off as dull at times. Alot of people seem to like this book alot. I think Patterson had something going at one point in the book (i wont say what cause i hate spoilers) but then it just made me yawn...luckly i went and decided to read Cat and Mouse...thank god...but like i said its a good thriller mystery...i would read it no matter what."
2,Not even good in German,"I'm learning German, so I got this book in its German version, Sonne, Mord und Sterne. This title translation should have warned me: Sun, *Murder* and Stars.It was a good choice from a beginning language student's perspective, but ultimately a disappointing book. One thing that really bothers me, and as another reviewer pointed out here, there is no actual police work or detective work. For example, murders are committed in very public places yet nobody reviews videotapes. Really, I don't see what it is Alex Cross did in either of the two separate serial murder cases, other than thinking real hard about them and sleeping badly when more crimes are committed.Oh well, on to Stephen King's The Stand auf Deutsch."
3,A Bit of 'Overkill',"Patterson spends the first 2/3 of the book building up for a surprise ending that is..... a little too surprising. The age of the one killer was ridiculous . Give me a break. Unless I missed it, what was the point of all the murders? I don't see how they could all be linked. Why would a homicide chief or whatever Cross's title is now be worried about a 13 year old when someone is trying to take out the president? At first I'm thinking cheaters and lying politicians were the targets but as the book went on, I couldn't find a common reason for any of them to be murdered. Oh, yeah I forgot... ""I just want to be someone"".Last two pages were kind of funny, obviously left it open for another Soneji/Cross smackdown. 3 stars because it was a good Summer weekend read."
4,Descent begins,"Once again, Detective Alex Cross is the main character in another James Patterson book. As usual, the story is very fast-paced, with quick, short chapters. Patterson knows how to build tension and accomplish an efficient thriller. This time, Cross and his team have to face two simultaneous enemies: the first, a pair of loose-cannon killers, acting in the high-society and political circles in Washington, D.C.; the other, an insane killer murdering innocent children.""Jack and Jill"" is not as good as the previous two books in the Cross series; although Alex Cross is less superhero-like and more humnan in this third installment, the two parallel stories are confusing, and Patterson was not able to create villains and minor characters as well developed as the ones he created in ""Along came a spider"" and ""Kiss the girls"".I understand that ""Jack and Jill"" is somewhat a milestone in the Alex Cross series. From now on, the books are really a step down the ladder.Grade 8.0/10"
5,Another win for Alex Cross,"This book was very exciting and hard to put down. Since I have been reading the Alex Cross series out of sequence, this book gave me another piece to the puzzle.The two plots in this book are well thought-out.Patterson does a great job in character development.This book presents Alex Cross in a much higher professional level compared to the other novels. He appears very focused on performing his job."
2,another boring subject...,i am tired of another president killing plot. i am not impressed with this book.
3,so so,"I enjoyed the story until the end. I did find it a bit formulaic and initially it reminded me alot of Along Came a Spider but it diverged. The only problem was the ending was disappointing for me. I guess its a matter of taste but I would have liked to know a little bit more about why all this happened and the ending was not satisfying enough. I must agree with another reviewer that Patterson has a particular style in the three books I've read. If badly done, as in Cradle and All, it can be a pain to get through. I loved Along Came a Spider but am tired of his formula already after three books."
3,Not Patterson's best page turner.,"Jack and Jill was my third Patterson novel following ""Along Came a Spider"" and ""Kiss the Girls"". Patterson kept me up nights reading ""Spider"" and ""Kiss the Girls"". However, it took me weeks to finally finish Jack and Jill. Maybe the timing was wrong. I am so tired and frustrated with all of the ""real"" happenings in Washington, D.C. these days, that it was difficult to entice my interest in these fictional D.C. characters. However, once I got into this read, I did enjoy it and couldn't wait to read the ending.Patterson's continual past referencing of Gary Soneji in this novel has definitely wetted my appetitie for ""Cat and Mouse"". I look forward to reading more from James Patterson and more about Alex Cross."
3,"Decent Plot, Third Grade Writing","I'll give him this: James Patterson is a good plotter. ""Jack and Jill"" is never dull, and I wasn't able to guess the ending.However, and this is a big however, Patterson writes on a third grade level, with lots of short paragraphs, repeated sentences, and italics for emphasis. There's not a challenging moment in this novel. He also seems entranced by horrifically brutal murders, many of children. While this may bring readers, it also has a gratuitous and unnecessary feeling.It's a quick read - fine if you're looking for something that won't tax your brain beyond the average episode of ""Matlock""."
3,"OK, but haven't we seen this before?","Alex Cross is indeed an interesting character cool, erudite, street-smart, and recognizably human. But Jack & Jill is essentially a routine ""serial thriller"" that belongs to the Patricia Cornwell/Tom Clancy school of writing. It's fairly well-written (though the shifting viewpoints are a bit of a distraction), the dialogue is melodramatic but effective, and the plot twists paced for every 100 pages or so make for diverting entertainment. But I kept thinking the book was too long, that there were too many unnecessary characters, and that I'd seen the plot to kill the President before in ""In the Line of Fire."" Thomas Harris did this kind of thing much better with Red Dragon."
2,Gimmicky,"An interesting story told through narrative ""gimmicks"" which detracted from rather than added to the suspense. Very ordinary for its genre. A quick read for a three time zone flight but you'll have forgotten it by the end of the trip."
5,one of james patterson's finest,"an amazing read.i have read almost all of james patterson's books and by far this is his best.just as the reader thinks he has the plot figured out patterson through his clever writing style tells you""not even close!!!''this book grabs the reader right from the beginning and doesn't let go until the very last words are read.the character of alex cross combined both brain and brawn,sometimes rare in thie genre of books.if an avid reader is unsure of which patterson novel to start with first,start with this one and i guarantee one will not be disappointed.i personally cannot wait until the next patterson novel featuring dr. alex cross is published."
3,"Good, but not as good as Kiss the Girls","The book is good at keeping your attention. It is the second Patterson novel I've read (both in the last three weeks). The first was Kiss the Girls and Jack and Jill is not as intense. The Truth School Killer storyline reveals the author's need to infuse the life of black low income Washington D.C. residents into his novels. In Kiss the Girls, you had some description of Alex Cross's home and neighborhood. Although good background for that novel, Patterson goes too far with the Truth School Killer storyline. He should have stuck with Jack and Jill as a solo storyline. The ending was too abrupt and cliche'd in dealing with the conspiracy angle, perhaps because of the overall length of the book. I was disappointed when he cut off the story in the last few chapters. The entire novel would have been much better off focusing solely on Jack and Jill and their killing spree. In fact, more development of their motivation would have been better."
3,ALEX CROSS AT HIS WORST-A DISAPPOINTMENT,"I LOVED ALONG CAME A SPIDER AND KISS THE GIRLS AND MAYBE THAT IS WHY I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH JACK AND JILL. IT WAS LESS SUSPENCEFUL, NOT NEARLY AS MEMORABLE OR SHOCKING. THE BOOK MOVES ALONG AT A TREMENDOUS PACE, WITH A NEW CHAPTER EVERY OTHER PAGE. THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT STORES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER WITH A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ON JACK AND JILL. THE BOOK STANDS ON IT'S OWN, BUT DOES NOT COMPARE WITH HIS PREVIOUS ALEX CROSS NOVELS."
3,Too many loose ends,"Too many loose ends in this book. I am still not sure what the 13 year old had to do with anything or why Jack and Jill wanted to kill the President, strange book but I did finish it so it wasn't that bad."
5,Jack & Jill,Another great Alex cross murder mystery. James Patterson is the master. Fast read and the characters are great. Love Alex and his family.
3,Jack & Jill a novel by James Patterson,"Although the book came in good condition, I was disappointed that it did not have a jacket. I collect hardbacks with covers and this one doesn't fit the bill.Bill Fagan"
5,Used Book,This used book is the best used book I have received. It is like a new book. The packaging was excellent - and condition was excellent. It arrived in just a few days.
5,so much fun and suspense...maybe his BEST BOOK in the series.........,maybe its because i read this book after such a long time after Patterson's previous book.... i was HOOKED and enjoyed it tremendously........though it had no well desciptions and Gruesome narration it still is thrilling and entertaing throughout..............
5,Another great Alex Cross mystery,I love James Patterson and his Alex Cross books. I read a few later ones first and now am going back and reading from the start. This book is thrilling with an unexpected ending. My best friend read it before me and re-read the ending twice again with me. Great book if you love mysteries!!
3,Alex Cross at his worst- a Disappointment.,"I LOVED ALONG CAME A SPIDER AND KISS THE GIRLS AND MAYBE THAT IS WHY I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH JACK AND JILL. IT WAS LESS SUSPENCEFUL, NOT NEARLY AS MEMORABLE OR SHOCKING. THE BOOK MOVES ALONG AT A TREMENDOUS PACE, WITH A NEW CHAPTER EVERY OTHER PAGE. THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT STORES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER WITH A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ON JACK AND JILL. THE BOOK STANDS ON IT'S OWN, BUT DOES NOT COMPARE WITH HIS PREVIOUS ALEX CROSS NOVELS."
1,"Poor dialog, wooden characters, cheap psychology","None of the characters in this disappointing book came alive for me; the detective, Alex Cross, interesting in the first few of this series, was a cliche here. The book simply didn't deliver on the promise of its first few chapters."
3,"Good news, bad news","James Patterson should be commended for an intriguing plot and good character development in Jack and Jill, but he should be criticized for his literary style. The plot is well paced and suspenseful with some unpredictable plot twists. He also creates some charactes, primarily Alex Cross, his grandmother, and his partner, who capture the reader's attention.Mr. Patterson's literary style, or lack thereof, is disappointing. Apparently his concept of a good simile is ""like hell"" or ""as hell"" because he relies on this simile throughout the novel. It is apparent that he knows better because he describes an event toward the end of the book ""as important as a cure for cancer."" Either Mr. Patterson thinks that his readers are as sophisticated as comic book readers or he is as lazy as a student who submits downloaded reports from the internet for homework assignments."
2,This book should have had half of it cut out.,"This book should have been two seperate novels, or they should have cut out the part about the Jack and Jill killers and just had Alex hunt the child murderer. The child killer is by far and away the most interesting plot in this book, whereas the actual Jack and Jill story is a mesh of too many plot twists, poorly thought-up characters, and too many forays into unbelievability. And probably the worst part about it (don't read on if you don't want the book somewhat spoiled) is that Alex really doesn't influence the Jack and Jill killer-plotline that much. But if you can muddle through the Jack and Jill parts, the hunt for the child killer is VERY entertaining, and in fact the killer is one of the most interesting/believable villians that I've seen in a novel in quite some time."
3,Predictable and Anti-climatic,"I agree full-heartedly with teekay62 and Sam C. Ogden. This novel lacks imagination in the fact that J. Patterson constantly describes characters by likening them to other characters (i.e. Kevin Costner in The Bodyguard if I remember correctly).I've read several of his other books and have seen ""Along Came a Spider"" and ""Kiss the Girls"". No comparison with this one. He builds up the plot and you expect large surprises, but none come."
2,Disappointing,"The best two things about this book are that it's mildly entertaining and that it's a fast read. Other than that, there are too many unresolved questions at the end (possible sequel?) and there's not enough congruity between the two parallel story lines. There are the usual plot twists and turns, but these usually had me thinking ""that's dumb"" rather than ""wow!"" If you just want a mindless read and don't care at all about the quality of the story, this fits the bill. Otherwise, skip it."
5,One of the greatest books I've read,"Although, this was the first James Patterson novel I read, I got hooked just by reading the prolauge. May be very violent, but the plot keeps you from saying ""Where's my bookmark?"" This books (1)about two people who calls themselves Jack and Jill and whom are on a killing spree with the most famous people in the US government (2)a killer who just wants to kill. Who's on their trail? Alex Cross. What I liked most about this book is how Patterson in each chapter has a different character's point of view, even the villain's. The villain's point of view seems so realistic, it almost seems that Patterson was once a villain! It just seems amazing how he can keep making puzzles and obstacles for Alex to survive. Overall, a must-read for over the summer."
1,"Same old, same old!","If Gary Soneji doesn't come back and exact his revenge on Alex Cross then I will! Same old Alex. Same old kids. Same old grandmother. Same old EVERYTHING. I ended up skipping parts of this book just to get through it and still didn't miss a beat. Alex Cross has more lives than that cat that Gary Soneji mysteriously sent to the Cross family in a previous novel. While I liked the others in this series, this was, by far, the worst! Maybe the next character won't be so predictable and in-your-face smart."
3,Disappointing,"The book, though entertaining, makes me feel uncomfortable because it contains too many swear-words. But that is not the worst of all.James Patterson has built up tension at the very beginning of the book. However, he is unable to put all the pieces together in a perfect fit. After reading the book you can't help asking:""Why so many celebrities were killed? It hardly makes sense.""""The prime motive of assasinating the president is inconsistent with what Jack thought before -- 'this is war'. Why?""""How can a thirteen-year-old teenage know so much about Alex, even where he lives?""Yes. You have a lot of mysteries to work out after reading the book. (You'll find more mysteries if you wish!) James Patterson is not going to tell you."
4,Another great Cross book,"James Patterson has done it again...another great addition to the Alex Cross series. JP does a great job of writing about two seemingly unrelated serial murderers - like a tennis game the stories volley back and forth. A little about the child murders, a little about the Jack and Jill murders. Alex Cross is stuck trying to solve both of these at the same time. Alex is torn between the child murders that are happening in his neighborhood and the Jack and Jill murders that are gaining national attention. Alex is asked to join the task force at the White House to solve the Jack and Jill murders because the murderers have made threats against the president. These stories are exciting and have twists that keep you on the edge of your seat! Not until the end of the book do you begin to see it all come together and understand the real motivation of the murderers.If you want a great thriller...read this book!"
2,Painful,"While this book does have an unexpected ending, it borders on painful to read. The author (usually quite good), tries to make up for the lack of developed characters with gratidous sex scenes. The whole plot: The president's life is in danger. Besides the poems ""Jack and Jill came up the hill, to kill, to kill, to kill"" this book is the same theme you've seen on every cop show fifty other times. It has an underlying plot involving a child murderer. The book appears to be two short stories, sewn together to fill a book."
1,"Disappointing, repetitive - and boring","Having heard so much about Mr Patterson's big reputation, I bought a copy of 'Jack and Jill'. Wish I hadn't bothered. As far as narrative structure is concerned, a high school teacher would be entitled to expect better from a class of 14-year olds (and would!). Monotonously short sentences, basic punctuation, little or no subtlety or sophistication in the way of grammar or syntax... you get the idea. Maybe Mr Patterson thought he was writing a fast-paced pulp thriller, but the masters of that particular art knew how to turn a sentence, how to make their work challenging. As far as 'Jack and Jill' is concerned, I've encountered more demanding stuff in a tabloid newspaper. At least I now know one author to avoid in future."
4,Patterson has done better,"I read Kiss the Girls and was so caught up in that I couldn't put it down. Maybe that is the cause for my mild disappointment in Jack and Jill. It was suspensful and had an interesting plot but it just wasn't the page turner that I had been expecting. Don't get me wrong, once I got into it it was hard to put down, the only problem was that it took me about the first third of the book to do so. Patterson still does a good job with detective Alex Cross' character and he also still writes in short chapters, which make even the not so exciting parts quick to get through. Overall, I guess I would recommend this book if you like Patterson and have the patience to wait for the expected excitment."
3,A Forced Effort by Patterson,"The third novel in the Alex Cross series finds Alex summoned to the White House. The killers, Jack and Jill, are murdering famous figures in the nations capitol, and Alex must break through government bureaucracy to discover the people behind these horrendous events. Unfortunately this novel feels forced. The character who came alive in the previous novel feel very flat. The thrills are still there, but the novel is not a good as the previous."
2,Tried to do too much in one book; loose ends.,"Each of the two stories would have been better standing on their own. While I understand the comparison the author was trying to make, there was too much story for one book and therefore both stories lost by it. Not enough on the motivation, background of the main characters which would have been interesting to see what made them tick and how they got to that point in time.I like Alex Cross and his family.By the time I got to the end of the book, I felt I didn't exactly know what happened and why. It just sort of ended."
1,"Badly written, preposterous pile of trash.","This is one of those books that's so bad you can use it to judge critics -- because if *anybody* says it's well written, or well plotted, or has good characterizations, THEY'RE NUTS. The fact is, there's NO characterization, the sentence constructions are painful, and at least one major plot point is impossible. (If you're paying even a minimum of attention, you'll put the book down and go, ""HUH?"")This book is good for exactly one thing: it shows you don't have to spend a lot of time writing a book -- or even be a competent writer -- to have a best seller. I don't mind mindless escapism -- heck, I'll give Janet Evanovitch two thumbs WAY up -- but when it's a trash heap like this it gives reading a bad name."
4,I'm hooked on Patterson!!,I am not one for writing down all the details of the book but will always give my honest opinion. The pages just kept on turning. Once I got started I could not put it down. He brings all of his charcters to life. Never a dull moment. If you like short and faced paced chapters this book is for you. This is now my third book and counting.
4,Doesn't live up to Kiss the Girls,"I like Patterson so I'm not saying that I don't like this book, it just didn't compare to Kiss the Girls. It was suspensful and had a good plot but I didn't find it to be as much of a page turner as I had hoped it would be. Don't get me wrong, once I got into it it was hard to put down, the only problem was that it took me about the first third of the book to do so. Patterson still does a good job of portraying Dr. Alex Cross in such a way that you feel like you know him and his short chapters make even the not so exciting parts quick to get through. Overall I guess I would recommend this book if you like Patterson and have the patience to wait for the expected excitment."
3,Not His Best Work!,"I really enjoy reading the Alex Cross series of books by Patterson but this book just did not excite me like the others I've read (Along Came A Spider, Kiss The Girls, and Cat & Mouse). I personally wish that he'd quit writing the ""two-killers-in-one-book"" stuff. Switching back and forth between the child killer and Jack & Jill was really getting on my nerves and this book just didn't give me the suspense or the adrenaline rush that I've gotten from his other books. I think Patterson, when he's at the top of his game, can write very exciting and suspenseful stuff. I haven't read Pop Goes The Weasel or Roses Are Red yet but I'm hoping they're both better than this one."
4,Alex Cross is the Man!,"I decided to skip the first two Alex Cross novels, (Kiss the Girls & Along Came a Spider) only because I regrettably saw the first two in movie form.Jack and Jill was a solid book filled with mind twists and a wide range of emtional moments. Just when you think you have figured it all out, guess again. I loved this book from the beginning to the end. I will continue to read the rest of the Alex Cross Books.If you are trying to decide if this is for you, I say read it and you will love it too!"
5,Another winner...,"Jack & Jill proves that James Patterson's previous success with the Alex Cross books are not flukes. Patterson is a great writer and Cross is a fun character.Trying to solve two crimes at once and see if they are in any way related- is no sweat for Alex Cross! With two story lines going on at once, you won't be able to put this book down. There's no shortage of suspense or excitement. And the ending is always the best part.If you have never read James Patterson and you enjoy crime thrillers, you need to give him a try!"
2,"My Third Patterson Novel, I'm Done","I've tried, after numerous recomedations, I just can't get into Patterson's style of writing nor his character, Alex Cross. I agree pretty much with the other 3 Star or lower reviews. Alex Cross is too boring, contrived, and unlikely as a detective for my enjoyment. I don't enjoy Alex's family ties, his partner, his methods of investigation [he has none other than his ""intuition""]. The dialogue isn't realistic...I feel I could do better and I don't consider myself a writer. The murders, the victims, and the perpetrators are beyond my realm of believability or interest. I'm a big Micheal Connelly and Harry Bosch fan. Maybe i'm spoiled by the suspense and realism of the crimes, police work, and dialogue of his books and characters. Patterson's stye of ""whodunnit"" doesn't do it for me."
4,Great!!!!,Man jack and jill was a great book. James patterson never lets me down even though this is the second book i have read by him it is still awesome. But Mr. Patterson man just think u and jesus could team up and ya'll would be unstopable.
4,I love Alex Cross books!,"I love this character and that is why I bought this book. The only thing that I would say I am hesitant about is that it involves children being hurt. Since I became a mother, things like that freak me out. So, if you don't like that in a book then its not for you. I liked it despite my fears."
4,Jack & Jill - James Patterson,"I was so into the story line that it was hard to put it down. It keeps you in suspense at all times. I would not have ever figured out the ending. I like all the Alex Cross books that I have read, and will read them all before long. I think James Patterson is an outstanding writer..Jack & Jill"
4,Good enough,"I think that the story of the book is a little bit out of reality, I don't think that if the president's life is threatened he will make his normal life and he will walk in Manhattan like a normal person, I also think that the people who works and live inside the White House are under investigation all the time and are followed by the security people in their spare time, so part of the story of the book doesn't have much sense. Nevertheless the book is a page turner and the end of the book, for me, was the only way to finish it, you will guess the end before you read it."
4,The Best,"The Best Alex Cross book. Other goods Alex Cross books are Kiss the Girls, Roses are Red, and Cat and Mouse."
4,This book was very entertaining and had me up late at night.,"I think James Patterson is an extraordinary write and ""Jack and Jill"" exhibits that. He writes very thick plots but at the same time uses language that anyone can read and understand. The story was very exciting, as the plot twisted and turned until the very end. Patterson had me guessing the entire ride, and what a ride it was."
2,Mindless entertainment,"For pulp writers, you have to remember one thing. It's not art; it's escapist entertainment. Characters aren't important. The plot can have holes. And as you're reading it, it's alright to think ""No way can this ever happen."" Also get ready for the author (and I use this term loosely) to repeat the same story again and again and again and again and again. Grisham, King, Koontz, and Crichton are masters at telling the same story over and over and selling millions.Well along comes James Patterson, and he doesn't even change the main characters. So, should we be surprised that every story seems the same? No, but it's a great way to give the brain a rest before starting up another more accomplished piece of literature.Happy summer reading."
3,last chapter was the best,"for 2 reasons. 1. An end to a book that I felt was not one of Patterson's better one. 2. Gary is back!!! I have read Along Came a Spider and Kiss the Girls and found them highly entertaining. Although I didn't like this particular one, I will not give up on Patterson and hope he came through again with Cat & Mouse. I find Alex Cross to be a believable character but the ""nobody cares about the black kids in the city"" theme seems to be running a little thin. For those who didn't like this one, I wouldn't recommend giving up on JP yet. Try something else first."
4,"Good Story Line and Plot, Great Suspense","After reading many of Patterson's previous novels, this is now one of my favorites. The story moves along well and his ability to keep two different plots and stories going at once is impressive. Solving the mystery behind the identity of ""Jack and Jill"" kept me going until the last page. A good, quick, exciting read!"
4,Good plot and interesting.,"Overall I enjoyed the book very much. Throughout I kept wondering why child murders were needed and how they interfaced with a plot to assassinate the president. Still not sure of the answer, but I guess Patterson was trying to bring to the forefront how humans are valued or de-valued based on race and societal standing. I think Dr. Cross should have had a larger role in solving each crime. He had very little involvement in the child murders and only played a part in the Jack and Jill case late in the book"
3,Worth the read on a long flight across country.,"Decent read. It has a lot of stuff going on and it does not seem to get all of the plots satisfied sufficiently. The main character, Alex Cross is one that you want to pursue. The sub plots could be pursued more also. I would recommend. Take a long flight across country and read the book"
3,Jack & Jill came to Capitol Hill...,"I am not much of a critic but I will give it a shot. It was interesting, not an edge of your seat type of thriller, but it kept a good pace. You know from the beginning who the killers are, but not really what their driving force is. So it keeps you trying to figure that out.This was only my second Alex Cross book. I have 3 more now to read but I am not a speedy reader. It takes me a couple of weeks to get through a book with a full time job, online schooling with lots of homework, a home, husband and cats etc... But I definitely found time to read this book. It was interesting and hard to put down. I would read at night when I went to bed until I literally fell asleep and the book slipped from my hands. I give it 3 stars as it was interesting, but I have a lot more of James Patterson's books to read. One can't give them all 5 stars."
3,solid but nothing special,This book in the AlexCross series is solid but nothing special.Aplus is how Cross and Sampsons frustration with the department bureaucracy especially chief Pittman is played out in regards tpo the priority of the two sets of murders .Cross does not want to emphasize the Jack and Jill prefering to focus on the child killer. The two storylines arent as well connected as they should be some of the transitions are rather abrupt and the idenity of the killer is disappointing unconvincing and even cliched. Jack and Jill is an ok crime novel solid but nothing special
3,James Patterson needs a better proof reader,"I love James Patterson, this book was just middle of the road for me. The main reason being that the amount of typos was extremely distracting. There was a typo on nearly every page! I'm reading the Kindle version and hoping that it is just a transcription problem (although this has never occurred with the other Kindle editions I own). I hope they find him a new proof reader, and FAST!"
1,boring book,"This book plods along. A US Senator is killed by the girl he took to a dinner party (the girl works at the White House); yet ace detective Alex Cross fails to interview her as a suspect? In DC, a city gripped by terror, a shooting occurs during the intermission of a play but no one has any idea who fired the shot? This book is a waste of time."
2,Pass,"This novel is severely hampered by a predictable, unoriginal plot, and cardboard cut out characters. It was dry, and utterly unsuspenseful. In fact, I really struggled to get through it.The book has the feel of something that was written off the top of the author's head, in about a week and a half."
2,Here we go again,I really enjoyed ALONG CAME A SPIDER. It was original and suspensful and had a great twist at the end. Patterson used this same formula in KISS THE GIRLS to somewhat lesser effect but it was a good book none the less. Now Patterson returns to the well yet again in JACK AND JILL. Enough already. If he can't find new ways to present Alex Cross's cases then he should retire the character. As I read this book I knew perfectly well that the male/female team of killers was not who the author was trying to focus our attention on. Once again the same plot device is used and it just gets weaker and weaker each time. I don't plan on reading any more Alex Cross novels... I've read them already.
1,"Awful, horrible, overwritten, melodramatic junk-reading",Listened to the audiobook version of this James Patterson novel in the car -- simply because my spouse bought it off a remainder table cheap and I figured we should get our money's worth. Twenty minutes into it I wanted to chuck the first tape out the window the writing (and the audiobook narration) was so overwrought. But then I listened longer as I realized how amusing the bad writing was. A wonderful text here for a creative writing class: how to write junk fiction that sells but which you'd never want to put your name on. Sad that someone can write as poorly as Patterson and sell oh so many books.
3,It is ok.,"I do not read such kind of books. It was not very good at first, but after the half of the book it is getting better and easy to understand."
1,Cartoonish and Shallow,"I read this book when I was stranded at a friend's house with nothing to read and was astounded to learn that the author of this series is regarded as a good writer. I suppose if you like shallow, cliche-ridden characters, a villain who is about as complex as Beetle Bailey, and a plot that simply takes the place of any real content in the novel, then this seems like a hell of a lot of fun. If you want more, then I suggest that you skip Jack and Jill completely. It's too irritating even to be a relaxing bit of fluff."
3,Does not live up to its legacy,"After reading Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider, I found myself very disappointed with Jack and Jill. The book was good enough to keep my attention and serve as an entertaining read, but it lacked the suspense and pure thrill that Patterson's first two Alex Cross novels had. I did not once feel more than cursory emotions for the characters and I did not have the rushes of adrenaline that were commonplace in the first two novels. If you want vintage Alex Cross, stick with the first two novels. Patterson seems to have sold out to the quantity over quality push that publishers use."
3,SPOILING THE STORY-I loved and hated that book,"Well ... I love James Pattersons Books ... it's the only author I am able to read without goin' bored ... My first book was Kiss the girls (that time in german)I was fascinating ... lately I am reading ""Pop goes the weasel"" ( I love the moveing weasel at the top of each page ;-)) ... I kind of love it ... but Jack and Jill ... I read it about 6 month ago ... it took me long time to be over with it. I guess about 4 month ( That are 3 month and 2 weeks more than I am used to ...)at all ... but at the end i felt a bit dissapointed ... I read all that stuff just for learn that there is no defined end ... Okay he is right ... there is 0 chance to get the real murderer but ... to close the book like that is still bothering me ..."
1,My last James Patterson novel...,"After reading Along Came A Spider and Kiss The Girls, this book removed any chance of me picking up another Patterson. While I was interested in the ending, I was disappointed with the writing. Unrealistic."
2,THE ROT BEGINS...,"After two brilliant novels, James Patterson has written a book that is both unoriginal, and doesn't make sense.(Warning: the next few paragraphs will give away the whole novel and all it's plot twists)The story is about two CIA agents (you don't know that in the beginning) who sets their sights on killing the president of the US of A. Yes, I know, in films and novels, the presidents life is ALWAYS in jeopardy, despite the thorough protection of the secret service.Patterson must have thought that that one storyline wouldn't bring the novel to a sufficient length, so he gives us another serial killer. When the killers identity is revealed (the killer is a twelve year old kid whose name I've forgotten) you'll be laughing...Well I laughed anyway.And last but not least, where would a Patterson novel be without a tender romance. This time our mate Alex falls in love with the kiddies principal. How romantic!"
2,Note that some sections are not included in the book,"Does not contain several parts, including part 25, transport aircraft...sections AMT's and teachers may need are left out.."
5,Thanks and God Bless,"Thanks and God Bless y'all and your families, friends, etc... for this much appreciated product for our family"
3,Frank Pourcel 100 All Time Greatest,This CD set has a large variety of music but the tunes lack the magnificent melodic flow that characterizes the similar theme groupings of the Paul Mauriat music.
4,Just what I wanted,I recieved on time and in good condition except that there were tape that holds the little snaps-on that the CD goes onto.
1,Requires broadband.,"That's about it...too bad, looks like a good game...but I don't have broadband--and didn't know I needed it.So that's that."
4,Fun-Life,"Half-Life is fun. When I started, I didn't have a gun. Then I walked around and all this stuff exploded and I got a metal stick. I killed some monsters. Then a guard helped me kill monsters, but they killed him. Then I killed more monsters and I jumped. But then I didn't jump right and I died. Then i killed more monsters. I found more guns and weapons and I killed more monsters. Then I took a break and ate some cookies."
5,Great!,This is very well made soap and smells like heaven. The price is competitive and it was delivered quickly. I think you would love it!
3,Good writing - good hard bound book - terrible light grey font,"What a earth would possess a publisher to produce a book in a light grey font? This book would be a challenge to read by anyone, young or old, in even the brightest light.TERRIBLE!!"
4,Encouraging - a must-read for anyone thinking of cruising!,"My sole complaint about this book is that it's too *#(! short. In recounting their travels, the Pardys persuade us to stop armchair-sailing and just DO it. I am about a week away from setting sail for points South in my own vessel, and owe them a debt of gratitude for having given me that necessary nudge to finally get on with it and go. If you're teetering on the fencepost, get this book. An easy read, it's sure to provide the impetus you've been waiting for."
5,Seraffyn adventure!,Awesome!! This book was a great pleasure adventure! Very much enjoyed the photos on my kindle fire! Thank you mucho! Time to sail!
2,Disapppointed,We were fans of previous reader rabbit programs again my daughter was challenged with the work that the disk requires but the only down fall is that this was a darker version.... Scary and more on the breaking the spells kind of game... Not interested!!! If you like reader rabbit and are looking for a game look for the reader rabbit 2nd grade mis-cheese-ious dreamship adventure....
4,Very fun and challenging,"I played this game when I was in elementary school, and I LOVED it. Some of the tasks got a bit boring/repetitive, but it is a good way to challenge your kid a bit."
2,Not what I expected,"My son is REALLY into these types of educational computer games. We have many Jump Start computer games and though they are more expense, we still prefer them. This game was okay."
2,Seconds parts sucks...,"In most of the cases, 2nd parts of a saga sucks just like The Japanese Wife Next Door 2... no girl + girl?"
1,Travel DVD -not worth it,"Do not waste your money on this DVD. It looks as if an amateur shot some film and then put it together with boring music and very limited info using audio voiceover. No live person giving you good travel info. It's really awful!!! Can't believe that Amazon sells this!!! Plus, it's old, like 1980's."
3,"There are better ones, to be sure","Although it is obvious that this is an outdated transfer from VHS, with its occasional lame elevator music, I found its campiness slightly amusing, I have seen worse ones. I like that this travelogue hits about 7 different cities within one hour. There are nice scenic views presented, from near and far, and interesting facts about each city. Since I have never been to Italy, I simply used this dvd as a starting point and it has given me an idea of what to see, but renting better travelogues is next. If you are willing to rent this with its faults, i believe you can gain a bit of knowledge."
5,Surreal World of No Return,"Once you enter the surreal, shaman-spirit filled world of Jorge Reyes, there's no return to the mundane and ordinary so called ""new age music"". Of course, Jorge would be deeply insulted if you called his creations new age. It's ethnic ambiance with a mixture of ponderous and sometimes sinister sounding electronic manipulations. This album is a fine gem that introduces those spiritually inquisitive to his music...in a sense, it is more or less a complilation of his other numerous works.. Enjoy!"
4,Tremenda Fragancia,"Buena Fragancia , su presentacion es maravillosa Spray , su precio esta de acorde a la calidad de Santos. Recomendable suave y refrescante"
1,"Great atmosphere, aimless story","I enjoyed the setup and found the ambience of the book to be great, but the story was meandering and aimless, and lost my interest."
2,gritty but a little too opaque,"David Grand's noir mystery, set in the period between the two world wars, has a complexity of plot and character that makes James Ellroy's novels look like ""Dick and Jane"" stories. The trouble is that there's no real pay-off at the conclusion to justify the effort the reader needs to make to keep straight the various subplots. Indeed, the argument could be made that the book lacks a plot at all and consists merely of a complex system of subplots. Perhaps this is what readers and reviewers mean when they refer to the work as somehow ""postmodern."" It lacks a center."
5,Outstanding,"This book was so incredible. It was one of my favorite books. If you read this book you will not be able to put it down. Once again, Detective Alex Cross is back. You want to go along and solve this crimes with him. It's about a serial killer going after young women, and capturing them. It's a must read. It's one of James Patterson's best books. Rumor has it, this book will soon be made into a movie , which should be interesting to see because of one particular well-written section in the book"
1,dark and disturbing,"I have always enjoyed reading suspense novels, but after I read Kiss the Girls I fervently wished I had never opened the book. It contains some of the most disturbing scenes I have ever read, which are now indelibly imprinted on my memory. I don't mind books with dark themes, but I believe the author pushed the envelope on this one. I feel that most readers, particularly women, will find this book quite offensive and disturbing in parts."
2,Holes wide enough to drive a Mac Truck through,"I was surprised how weak this book was. It had a great start but fizzled soon there after. It seemed as if the author was trying to find ways to lenthen the story. There were so many holes. I wondered why the area where Kate emerged from her ordeal was not immediately and thoroghly searched. They eventually get to it late in the book. Also, when ""The Gentleman"" made his get away, why didn't the FBI just shoot the tires of his car? The author skirts around the identity of the villian so much that by the time he is reveal its like, ""DUH!"""
3,unanswered questions,"Other reviewers have noted the ineptitude of the FBI in the stakeout of the cabin, the failure to search the area where the house ""disappeared"", the stupidity of the girl returning to her isolated house without protection, etc. The question I wanted answered most was how the California reporter first suspected it was the doctor who was the ""Gentleman Caller."" His name simply appears on her file, no explanation. And if the ""Gentleman Caller"" was a doctor who had just moved the last year from North Carolina, how did he set up his practice so lavishly? Puhleez, can't an exciting story (like this one sure is) have an editor who helps the author plug the holes a bit?"
3,Patterson gets a 3 1/2 stars,"Not bad for my first ever James Patterson novel. He style is efficient and his novel is fast-paced to bring suspensful aura that will make readers aask for more. His main character, Alex Cross, is appealing. ""Kiss the Girls"" is a little on the strong side with the full desriptions of the killer's rapings and murders. Though the book is incredibly written the ending brings slight disappointment. By Patterson's vague and nebulous hints of who the killer is, you can guess before the novel is done. Though it has only but a few minor flaws, the intensity and truth to the killers' minds sends a chill down your spine beyond any you have ever felt before."
5,This book was well written,"I read this book all in one night. It was very well written. The suspense keeps you turning the pages, but I do not recommend it if you have a weak stomach. I felt like I was part of the action (Dr.Kate McTiernan). After I finished reading the book, I was afraid to turn out the lights. Excellent book!!!!"
4,"One Fun Read, Definately Worth the Buy","This book is one fun read. I really enjoyed the machine gun staccato feel of the short chapters which hardly gives the readers a chance to catch their breath. The characters are written in a way that they are very believable yet there actions do sometimes seem absurd. I enjoyed that the hero of the story isn't your typical run of the mill detective and that the case was in direct conflict with his feelings. It keeps you guessing as to the killer yet does fall somewhat flat when the case is solved. I would definately recommend this book, especially if you have a long flight"
5,DR. ALEX CROSS IS BACK!,DR.CROSS IS BACK IN THIS CHILLER THAT PITS HIMAGAINST NOT ONE BUT TWO SERIAL KILLERS! CROSS'NIECE IS KIDNAPPED BY ONE OF THE KILLERS IN THESOUTH CAROLINA. THIS NOVEL HAS PLENTY OF TWISTSAND TURNS. DR. CROSS IS FASCINATING HERO AND YOULEARN MORE ABOUT HIM.
5,"Book #2, check!","Even better than the first Alex Cross book. Looking forward to book 3 which I already downloaded. If u haven't read these books and u like action, suspense and an overall great story, get on it!! U don't know what it missing."
3,"See the movie, skip the book...","Holes throughout the plot kill this book. After reading Along Came a Spider (a 10!), I was disappointed with this one. I like some of the twists and turns in the plot, but things jump around too much to follow it. Patterson writes a good thriller, but he missed on this one."
2,An episode of Baywatch has a more intelligent ending!,"Patterson has succeeded in writing a great page turner. The twists and turns will keep you up reading long past your bedtime. HOWEVER: the ending is supposed to be the climax of all the earlier work. KISS THE GIRLS fails miserably in it's conclusion. The ending is actually an anti-climax after the event in Chapel Hill. Patterson obviously had his sights on converting this story into a movie script, and the ending reads like a bad ""B"" movie.One cannot help but wonder about Pattersons dark side with the inclusion of such seat squirming passages as the ""snake and milk"" chapter. Also disturbing is his fascination with his ""GLOCK"" and repeated racist remarks"
2,Yawn.,"I give this book a 3 only because it provided some marginally interesting details left out by the movie, which is why I read it. Hardly compelling at all, though it tries so hard to be, this tale is a better movie than a novel, an almost unheard of embarrassment."
3,I think the author needs to keep track of his characters!,"I found Kiss the girls hard to put down, but not hard to throw across the room when Kate's eyes magically went from blue to brown to blue and back to brown throughout the book. Did anyone else notice this? And when Alex and Sampson went to visit Kate, they arrived at a little after ten, stayed for a couple of beers, good ships?, and left a little after nine-thirty. Hmmmm? I didn't know who Casanova was, and that kept me reading. Mr. Patterson, I will continue to read your work, but please make up some bio pages on your characters, for yourself and the sanity of your readers"
3,"A fairly enjoyable book, if you can ignore the many flaws","I picked this book up after seeing the film version; the book was even better than the movie. Thinking that I've found a new author to read, I rushed out and bought four other Patterson novels. Into the 3rd book, I started to realize something: he writes the same novel over & over, and his formula doesn't hold up after more than one book. Although he writes fast-paced, fairly involving stories, his dialogue is awkward and his characters are unbelievbale. His good guys are too good to be true, and his bad guys are too evil to be believable. Patterson's main character, Alex Cross, is so insufferably perfect, I came to despise him. I was actually hoping for him to be killed in the last novel I read, and was disappointed when he wasn't. (I can honestly say this is the 1st time I've taken such a dislike to a fictional character.)My advise is to read one Patterson novel, with ""Kiss The Girls"" being the best bet, and then move onto a new author."
3,Psycho-thriller keeps you turning pages,This was my first James Patterson novel and I found myself engrossed in this complex two-coast mass murder mystery. The concept of a Cassanova kidnap/murderer with a twin on the West Coast made for a fascinating read despite some lame dialogue and character development. The premise and the action scenes were all the worthwhile and I'll rent the movie now to see how the director retells the story.
4,good reading,"i read this book on a long six hour flight needless to say i enjoyed it, even my mum enjoyed it when i loaned it to her. thanks for a good read."
4,Gruesome yet compelling,"Ever read a book that was compelling and gruesome, and you still couldn't put it down? ""Kiss the Girls"" is one such book. Having read and enjoyed ""Along Came a Spider"", I felt compelled to read this second book in the Alex Cross series. Had I known of the graphic and gorey details of this book I probably would not have picked it up to begin with. However, I was already hooked after the first page, and every page thereafter.If you are a fan of James Patterson, and can get beyond the gruesome scenes of women being brutally raped and murdered, then you, too, will probably find yourself turning the pages of this book to the very end."
5,Awesome,Alex Cross does it again. Kiss the girls throws you through a wild appalling mystery that has twists and turns in every page
5,Great Read,Even better than the movie.....Love the way he (Alex) shows you how he solves the crime while being a real person.
5,Great book for a quick high interest read,"This book was fantastic, edge of your seat, suspense thriller if ever there were one. Fiance and I were also pleasantly surprised to learn that the movie follows the the book quite closely being sure to incorporate all significant plot lines. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a quick and high interest read this is your book."
5,Didn't want to like it,"I'll admit, I didn't want to like this book. Having never read Patterson before I thought of him as a book factory. The Wal Mart of books. I was hoping this would prove my point and it didn't. Granted, I've heard his later books with co authors drop off in quality, but this one is fantastic. He toys with you the whole time and when you think you know who Casanova is (I had about 5 different theories), he turns the tables. I need to read more Alex Cross. Excellent thriller."
4,about what you expect,"James Patterson writes a lot of different books now (with a lot of people) but in the good old days he wrote with a pretty consistent mystery/thriller style. He's a little bit sadistic at times, but all in all he draws you in with great characters and intense plots. I don't like some of the fields he has strayed into lately, but this one is classic Patterson, for better and worse!"
5,Great Book,I saw this at the movies before I read the book and the movie was good. But the book is better. I literally had trouble putting it down!
5,Wow!,"This was the first Patterson book I've read; it won't be the last. There aren't many books that I read in one sitting, but this was one. Gripping from the first pages, the book kept me on the edge of my seat until 1:30 in the morning when I finished. I highly recommend it."
4,Great Read!,"I had seen the movie before ever reading the book. I liked the movie a lot and when a friend at work told me to read the series, that it was so much better I downloaded the entire collection. I definitely have enjoyed it. And would recommend it to others. The series is not for those easily offended by rape, torture or any kind of sadistic violence. My only complaint is that the kindle books are pretty expensive, I found 1 through 17 as PDF files for fourteen bucks and downloaded that. But I definitely would like to see his other books cheaper so I could read his other collections."
5,"Awesome Book, Bad Movie.","LOVED IT! I've been a big fan of James Patterson books for awhile now, espesially the Alex Cross series. This book kept me turning the pages and not wanting to put it down. I read the book first then decided after loving it so much that I would watch the movie. What a let down the movie was. Morgan Freeman played a good Alex Cross but would not recomend seeing the movie. If you love a page turner and a book that you can't put down get this book, you won't regret it."
1,Disgusting,This is my 4th James Patterson novel and absolutely my last. The sexual violence was pornographic and his portrayal of the women characters was shallow and demeaning. How in the world could Kate feel any sexual feelings towards Alex just a few short weeks after having been held hostage and raped repeatedly? I threw the book away and wish I had never read it.
4,Alex Cross Faces a Darker Mystery,"In this, the followup to the exciting novel Along Came a Spider, author James Patterson continues to follow D.C. Detective Alex Cross as he searches for his missing niece. What he discovers is sure to send chills down your spine. Although this novel is much darker than the previous installment, the fast pace and plot twists are sure to keep readers entertained."
3,A bit of a let down...,"After reading Along Came a Spider, I eagerly looked for other Patterson novels. Kiss the Girls was not quite as good, but was still difficult to put down, just because of the style of writing. Even though I had it figured out sooner than Patterson seemed to think I would, there were still loose ends I had to finish the book to sort out. However, I thought it was a little sad that he couldn't remember his own heroine's eye color.The movie was not as good as it should have been (maybe next time I can direct) Anyone who saw the movie and liked it should read the book, too. As long as you have no problem with snakes..."
4,Let's see the movie,"Kiss the girls is a suspense filled novel of detective Alex Cross who is searching for a kidnapper who calls himself Casanova. Casanova ends up kidnapping Alex's neice Naomi. Casanova leads Alex on all these wild goose chases. To find out if Alex catches the worlds greates lover, read Kiss the Girls by James Patterson."
5,Movie/Book Differences,"Being a movie nut, I love to see the differences between movies and thier respective novels. This one I particularly enjoyed reading. The Screenwriter definitely did a wonderful job of interpreting the novel. One thing I thought was interesting was that in the ALEX CROSS novels, we always meet his family. In the novel, it briefly mentions his aunt, never showing his kids. Also, I must say that the movie depicts a better ending -- that being more suspencfull. I can sum up this whole review by saying that the movie ""tightens"" up the action that spans the novel. The book ""expands"", leaving room for lots of detail and more scenes -- because that's exactly how you read this book, in short two-page chapters which ultimatly read like scenes in a movie. Loved it!"
1,Sexually violent thriller lacks any redeeming qualities,"After reading the glowing reviews here, I thought this would be a great page turner; unfortunately, it is more of a stomach turner. Sure, I read it in one coast-to-coast flight, it has two-page chapters and jumbo type. It needs to, the people who read and enjoy such novels require this. Bottom line, this is a needlessly sexually violent thriller without a plot, character development, or element of mystery to solve. Save your money, the only reason I did not give it no starts is that is not a choice."
2,"Clumsy plot, undeveloped characters","When I first read this book, I expected it to be good or at least interesting since it was made into a movie. However, I was badly disappointed. The author tries to go over the top with having not one but two serial killers, but the result is soggy and nearly unreadable. The plot is confusing and boring and halfway through I found that I just didn't care anymore. Most of the characters are cliches, and all the violence was unnecessary and gratuitous. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone except the hopelessly bored."
3,"I can only give it an ""all right""",It was an interesting page-turner featuring detective Alex Cross as he follows a two coast serial killer/killers. It was a very easy book to read...but not enough detail with the crimes or with the investigation.It was also rather annoying how some of the main characters including Alex Cross were given so much autonomy in the investigation. I am not asking for explicit realism - but sometimes common sense should not be overlooked.It was overall a fun read...a quick read...but not very satisfying.
5,Excellent!,"I loved this book! It was so good, it gave me nightmares!!!!!! (Which doesn't happen often!"
1,fair,no big surprise in this book. prefer better character development. predictable and was expected . prefer author's other books to this one
3,"I loved the anticipation, but where was the climax?","I have to admit, that I saw the movie before I read the book. And I have to say that it wasn't that bad of an adaptation. It was differnt than the book, but not in a ""bad"" way. The book was an easy read (took less than 3 days) and I liked the fact that the chapters were short enough to never have to stop reading in the middle of the chapter. The plot was very good. But it lacked the foreshadowing needed to slove the mystery. I reccomend this book to someone who has not seen the movie yet. Maybe they could shed some light on whether they saw the killer coming."
4,Great book,"PROS: This is one good suspenceful novel. The mood is great, the characters are great, and the book is great. This is another great James Patterson novel. James Patterson rules!CONS:Don't know why they made this one a movie instead of the first book with Alex Cross. (""Along Came A Spider"")BOTTOM LINE: I would recommend this book to people who didn't see the movie, because if they already saw it, it spoiles the fun."
5,A perfect work of literature,"Go out and get it now! Patterson's work contained great description and it had a great plot with a twist of suspense. Also, rent the movie with Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd. If anyone tells you differrent ignore them and go out and get it!"
5,Masterful,"When I read 'Kiss The Girls', I thought this book was masterful.This is the second Alex Cross adventures, and i truly loved this novel. The novel is based on 'Casanova' and 'The Gentleman' these two men are notorious for collecting women from different backgrounds and different personalities.Then when the kidnapping of Alex Cross's niece, Alex Cross then decides that he needs to find her, and goes to Virginia to find her, but he is out of his jurdiscidation, but that does not matter to Alex because his niece is gone, and he wants to fine her.But then when one woman escapes from the hands of 'Casanova', she then finds Alex and tries to help him locate 'Casanova', but Alex does know that 'Casanova' and 'The Gentleman' have been working together, and he needs to find out now, and find his niece before she is possibly killed.Now how this novel ends, I dont want to ruin the ending, but it is definitely a collection getter."
4,Great book but not quite 5 stars for me.,"I enjoyed the book as a whole. I love the way Patterson tells his stories. This book had a couple of things that bothered me though. There were a few passages that stood out while I was reading and I waited for their conclusion, but they just sort of disappeared into the story. He made them seem significant in the story, but then they were never mentioned again.I like twists and turns as much as anyone, but in my opinion there were one too many with this book. When the final bad guy was revealed, I felt kind of let down because there were too many build ups leading up to the reveal. I had spent my energy on the false bad guys so I was kind of like,""mehhh"" when the conclusion hit me.Patterson is an all time great author and I will continue to read all of his offerings, but this one let me down, just a little bit."
3,Typos,"I liked the book, I have read many by this author, but there are SO many typos in the Kindle for Mac edition. I hope they proofread more of the next title I buy. I could figure out what the real text should say, but this should not happen."
5,A good police book,"This book is amazing in every message it gives, first of all Alex Cross is a good father, play with his children all the time he can, he never gives up at work and has respect for his friends and family.Kate is a person who wanted to live no matter what, at first you think that she is a little bit smug but when you know how was her childhood you will understand why.The story of the kidnapping of the girls, the investigation and even the horror that suffers the girls don't skip anything or takes it from the hand, everything that happened in the book is perfectly explained, sincerely much better than Hannibal."
4,Worth reading,"I had never read James Patterson before so I wasn't sure what to expect starting this series. Although it seems as if everything goes wrong, time after time, you find yourself engulfed in the story without even realizing. Alex Cross is a mysterious man; I think I'd like to get to know him better with the rest of this series..."
1,Utter Tedium,"I can't believe I read the whole thing, it was truly dreadful. Patterson wants to be Thomas Harris when he grows up, but just can't cut it. An easy enough page turner, but ridiculously plotted and had no characters or ideas to catch this reader's interest.Patterson has some serious personal issues about women he should resolve, and leave the rest of us out of it."
2,Formula Book which insults the readers intelligence,"This book uses every best seller trick, short chapters that always end on a suspenseful moment, lots of action, sex, torture, etc. Unfortunately the author insults our intelligence every step of the way. How does a woman end up in the woods, beaten and crippled, yet there is no search to see where she comes from (ever hear of bloodhounds). This is only one example of the stupidity of this book. I will never read another book by this author."
3,"Decent, but not a great...","This book was enjoyable but felt rather two-dimensional. I mean, you hardly got to know the Gentleman Caller, and before you can realize it, he's dead. You never learn what Casanova did in that house in the prolouge, which would have made a better story itself. The ending wasn't satisfying, yet I stayed up till' 3 a.m. reading it. Well, I had to stay up all night and that was the only novel I had on hand. Anyway, it's good if you're a Patterson fan, but just decent otherwise."
3,decent,"This was a decent book as far as detective type thrillers are concerned. The reading was easy and interesting and I found myself curious as to who the killer was. Unfortunately, I knew who it was already, having seen the movie, but if you are able to forget that you will find it quite suspenseful. Cross creates characters with an emotional breadth and sensitivity that are surprising for novels of this type. I was assigned to read this book for my Reading Popular Fiction class at Syracuse University, we were supposed to notice how the female lead is a strong woman and how women's role in popular fiction has changed since trash like Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Personally I don't think Patterson gives a damn about women's role in fiction, he just wanted a smart sexy woman to pair up with his badass cop."
2,Not as Described,Although I am very happy with your prompt shipping... this book has no dust jacket. That was not mentioned in the description. I only buy books with a dust jacket.
5,Definately a book that you can't put down,"This book was so intense and exilrating that it was impossible to put it down. James Patterson is an incrediable author who knows how to keep his reader interested and wanting more. Kiss the Girls has a great plot, terrific characters and an all around great story."
5,The Best Alex Cross Adventure....Yet!!!!!!,This is my favourite Alex Cross book! This gets you on the edge of your seat right from the very first paragraph and doesn't stop until you have finished. Long live Alex!!
5,Thriller from beginning to end!!,This book had me attached to it till the last page. The plot is full of twists and turns that keep the reader on the edge of their seat. The characters draw you into the book so you feel like you're there watching the action first hand. Excellent book! I'd recommend it to anyone. I can't wait to read the more James Patterson books!
3,Not a Detective's Handbook,"Another quick page turner by Patterson. I like the fact that there are breaks in the book every couple of pages (120 or so chapters in a 450 page book) so it was easy to find a place to leave off.The investigation was a disaster. Why weren't the girls who escaped extensively interviewed? Why wasn't the approximate area of the underground house hammered by dogs and search parties? How were these psychos keeping a healthy marriage when they spent extensive time at the underground house? Book probably spent more time on Cross's personal life than on the actual ""Kiss the Girls"". Nice transition into Jack and Jill with Soneji escaping from prison. I had high expectations for Patterson here after Along Came a Spider. All in all, It was an 'OK' book."
4,Fast moving,I have been a Patterson fan for almost a year and this book was difficult to put down. He has worked up the suspense really well in this one. The details of the torture that the one killer puts the woman through was so detailed that I shuddered to myself. I would not recommend to children or adults with weak stomachs though... it is pretty graphic. Great book!
1,Do not even open this book!!!,"""Kiss The Girls"" was easily one of the sloppiest books I have read in quite a long time. The chapter are only 2-3 pages long and nothing is fully explained. Alex Cross is a great character but it would be a lot better if we got to know more about him. The enemies are one-dimensional and never fully given an opprtunity to shine. I hated everything about this book and I just wasted valuable time reading it."
1,not as painful as a root canal,"This movie was generic Hollywood, but it had potential, so I decided to read the book. To say I was disappointed is putting it mildly. This book reads like a novellization of the movie. The plot is nearly nonexistant and Mr. Patterson is simply not a very good writer (he uses exclamation points in the text, for heavens sake--a favorite trick of junior high girls to punch up their diary entries). Now, I am not someone who looks down on popular culture and the thriller genre. I read large amounts of murder mysteries and I've been counting the days until the sequal to ""The Relic"" was released. In short, there is little I can't struggle though. This book, however, was too much for me."
1,Juvenile plot... cliched dialogue... total waste of time.,"I'm usually so easily entertained by unrealistic action/detective stories that I feel a little guilty tearing throgh them. I expected that to happen with this 'best seller', but it starts out unbelievable and then just gets dumber and dumbest... until I was yelling at the stupid tape.Supposed 'expert' profiler/detective Cross wanders aimlessly - not bothering to protect his prime witness (or even question her closely), check phone records, or maybe look around the area where she escaped - while his niece languishes in the killers lair being raped (& not minding it???) for weeks. The FBI & local cops let Cross run the case because he's such a genius, I guess...I'm usually too gullible, but this ludicrous plot made me just laugh."
2,"Reasonably engaging, but ultimately pretty lame","I bought this book at the airport to read during a 4.5 hour flight. On the positive side, the book accomplished it's primary mission of keeping me occupied during the flight (I don't care for flying all that much). The characters are likeable and the story is mostly interesting. I'm not sure if I care for the author's writing style (""Joe Smith was the Killer! It was Joe! Joe!""). The red herring that leads you to falsely deduce the identify of the killer isn't clever as intended. Rather, it left me annoyed. I don't mind that I was wrong in my prediction, but there was not any substance whatsoever to support that conclusion. The book kind of felt as if it was written with a movie adaptation in mind (haven't seen the film, so I can't comment on the quality of that). I'm not a voracious reader of this genre, but I've read a few Thomas Harris titles (Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon). I felt that those two were much better than this one over all."
3,pretty entertaining but anyone could write it,"just finished this book. very entertaining, well paced.but alot of weaknesses. first, one person said it's a who-dunnit till the end. basically any of the characters could have done it if they were white males.also, their two big breaks in the cases are basically given to them. it's just unbelievable. i look at well done books and wonder how authors come up with their plots but in this one they just stumble onto it. no columbo or rockford files smart detective work here. when you see the ending, i guess it is obvious that patterson didn't want his detective to be perfect.not a terribly believable love story between alex and kate (was that her name?). maybe added something to the plot.a very easy read. hadn't read a book in a few months so got me back in habit which is good."
2,Middle School-level reading,"This book is very very easy reading. I polished it off in about 6 hours.If the author hadn't reminded me every few paragraphs or so of how rotten I should feel for being white, it would have been a better read."
2,Shallow thriller,"This is a thriller that reads like a cheap romance novel. The plot is simple and the characters are trite and unreal. After reading a Forsythe novel, this novel reads like a comic book.The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that it is a mercifully fast read."
1,Needlessly gory and poorly written as well,"It disturbs me to see how many reviewers, particularly females, raved about this book. This book contains some of the sickest sexual scenes I have ever read. I am not a prude, nor do I mind sex or violence in books if there is a reason for it. However, the sexual violence in this book is unnecessary and very disturbing. This is easily the worst book I ever read. I could not finish it and I regret even starting it. I would say it was one step shy of pornography of the sick variety. Judging from the reviews, however, many people are not offended by this sort of thing. People are entitled to their opinions but there are some things that simply should outrage us all. I'd recommend putting this book in the trash where it belongs."
1,"Wretched, dull","I don't know what anyone sees in this book. Complete neglect of logic; implausible plot twists; utterly stupid behavior introduced only to advance the lame plot: all characterize this very poorly written book. One example: the heroine excapes the bad guy, recuperates in hospital, and, despite the fact that the bad guy is still at large and knows where she lives (its where he found her in the first place), she returns to spend night there alone! Save your money and go buy any of the much better books by other authors in the detective/thriller genre."
1,Not For Me,I put this book down after suffering through the first half. I couldn't get past the over-the-top graphic descriptions of the murder and torture scenes. Absolutely ruined the read for me!
1,See Movie,"I agree with the other review of this book. I saw the movie and really enjoyed it. So I picked up the book. I found the book very disturbing, and not in a fun way. I found it degraded the women characters in a way I have rarely seen. As a woman, it was so uncomfortable to read I wanted to put a warning here."
2,Just didn't like it,"I read this book because of the reviews and I just loved Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas. However this book was just gross. If you like reading about rape and ideas such as forcing a snake up someones anus to widen it, then this book is for you."
1,Too creepy for me!,"I usually enjoy James Patterson's books and don't mind some of the graphic descriptions, but this story was WAY too creepy for me. The snake scene - creeped me out for weeks!I was really disappointed in the ending. For a twist to work at the end, you need to bring back a character you've seen more than twice in the entire book! While I never would have guessed the ending, it left me disappointed because it could just have well been a stranger off the street who was the villain."
3,"1st Patterson book I have read, ending was anticlimatic.","I just wasn't impressed with the book overall. I had some high expectations since it has been quite popular but I just think it was not as strong in areas it could have been strong in. Specifically, the Gentleman Callers role was not developed to the extent it could have been. Talk about an ending that was a real letdown. I haven't written Patterson off though, I think I will give his book A Long Came A Spider a chance."
2,A semi-enjoyable book by a 100% sick puppy.,"Yeah, I turned the pages rapidly to see what happens next. Read it all the way to the end. Then hurled it as hard as I could against the wall. Man is sick, mainly where it concerns women."
3,Would Patterson himself recognize Kate McTiernan?,"Much better than the usual of this genre; holds interest all the way and is well paced.However, there are distractions: 1. The short chapters. 2. Early on Alex refers to his Glock ""revolver."" 3. Chapter 10.....Casanova's description of Kate, Her eyes were dark blue, etc. 4. Chapter 84.....Alex knows Kate's line from ""The Pawnbroker""--I could see anxiety in her dark brown eyes.... 5. Chapter 91.....Alex introduces Sampson to Kate and Sampson stared into her blue eyes .6. Chapter 102....Alex in Kate's private hospital room: Alex stared into the vacant brown eyes."
2,Kiss The Girls,"Very disappointing... I'm sure some people like violent sex and murder, but not me. I liked the Murder Club series, it had sex and murder, but this one was just sick."
3,Addicting despite the flaws,"After recently finishing the first Alex Cross novel, ""ALONG CAME A SPIDER,"" I was a little reluctant to begin ""KISS THE GIRLS"" but still wanted to see why a movie studio would begin a series of films using the second Detective Cross story. Don't get me wrong, both ""ALONG CAME A SPIDER"" and ""KISS THE GIRLS"" are very enjoyable reads, not to mention fast and easy. However, I did find trouble with Patterson's too-good-to-be-true (or evil) characters, forced and scripted dialogue, and enough similar scenes in both novels to make me question if the author knows he's repeating himself (i.e. Alex Cross falling for the female lead, two nasty villians, victims being kept underground).At least I can say that ""KISS THE GIRLS"" was a much better novel than it was a film, despite how much I enjoy Naomi Judd and Morgan Freeman. And I'll look forward to the next Alex Cross novel as I find James Patterson's writing addictive while being a light read."
2,not a good one...,"...if you ask me. I'm not a racist in any way, but all that Black Tough Man Hero stuff gets sooo boring after, well, not very long. And all the ladies locked in the house for weeks, keeping cool and functioning without going insane? Yeah right, very realistic."
3,Good but a little drawn out,"I enjoyed this James Patterson book as much as any other, but I felt like the story took a long time to unfold. I remember thinking, how have weeks gone by and nothing has really happened. It could have been shorter. I usually don't feel like his books drag out.. I'm usually kept in suspense.. but this one dragged a little bit for me."
5,Kiss The Girls,James Patterson is one of the best authors I have come across.The whole Alex Cross series is heartpounding. I could not put the book down. I recommend everyone read the Alex Cross series.
1,dissatisfied,"This book was purchased with 2nd day delivery, on 1/1/10 and has not been received, now a month later. There has been no response from the supplier. I was charged for the purchase. It was not received and my e-mail to aplusbooks has not been answered."
5,You'll never look at kissing the same way again.,"Even before his harrowing encounter with mad-man Gary Soneji, Alex Cross was no stranger to the dark side of human nature. But, now it's been introduced into his family. After his niece is taken by a South Carolina serial killer named Casanova, he is forced to search for any way to get her back. Casanova is a deadly threat. Loving and sweet in his own twisted mind, he is the ""perfect lover"" for the perfect woman. Until she breaks his rules. Then he turns savage. And when it seems that Casanova has a West-Coast counterpart, Alex is more determined than ever to save his niece. With the help of the only victim to escape Casanova's lair, can he find his niece and all the other woman who have been ripped from their lives by this ""Prince Charming""?This was a wonderful book. Full of suspense and psychological thrills, I highly recommend it."
4,the best of Bloom,"This is vintage berkeley. I enjoyed a lot of his stuff from that time period. Many political references that just made fun of the people of the time. Doesn't get more ironic or insulting than that in just a few frames. I liked the read and the way the characters evolved. Yea, Opus! Good stuff."
4,Not as entertaining as the Level II workbook,"Japanese For Busy People is an odd series: It was not composed at once, but instead each piece came at a different time. And this is evident both in the main books and the workbooks.While I really enjoyed the Workbook for level II, I must say this one is too dry, exercises are too short, and overall lacks the ""story"" that was present in Workbook II thanks to Mr. Biji. Our friend is still featured, but not as prominently as he should have.On the other side, this book gets more serious than the previous and provides valuable cultural information, together with Kanji practice, a necessity for those going Heisig-Sensei's path."
2,secret desires of a horsewife 2,"to short of a movie. I am not a fan of softcore adult movies, need more complex roles plays and some better actor."
2,Already seems dated,"I don't know what it is. The book seems to be a classic and that I can understand. But I pulled out the tape to listen to after not having heard it for some time and it seemed so out of date. Some parts were almost embarrassing, and in all was a mishmosh of biblical, new age, and groovy girl advice. A friend of mine borrowed it a while ago and was listening to it in her car. her 10-year-old son said, ""Mom, this is so dumb!"" Sometimes kids do tell the truth."
1,"You mean, people dont know how to be Grateful??","Good thing I did not have to buy money for this...hey, I am grateful, yippee. I went down to the local library and borrowed it and I couldnt wait to hear her ideology. I for one, think it is preposterous that so many women are seeing Sarah as God. She is not wise, or full of wisdom. What is her message? She is saying the same exact thing the New Age and Religious Communities have been saying for at least the last 15 years...be grateful, have gratitude. She acts as if she invented the idea...and what is worse, people are buying it. I cant believe people are buying this tape to learn how to be grateful. I have an idea, and it doesnt cost you anything...learn to say ""Please"", ""thank you"", and dont cut people off on the freeway."
2,777111.,"Although it's interesting to see where Merzbow came from, and interesting to hear some examples of his less ""complete noise-wash"" work, I can't say this pair of discs held my interest for long. I like the noise-wash stuff, for its intense and overwhelming quality. These older pieces struck me more as just ... the annoying noodlings of an abstract experimentalist on an uninspired day. It's too obnoxious to be played in the background, and too unenriching to be listened to closely for an hour."
2,"Gripping for 1/2 of it, falls flat at end","I had read the first two novels in this series, so I was pretty psyched to read this one. The book is strong in the beginning, and the intense relationship between Hirel (an emperor's son) and Prince Sarevan is enough to carry it through quite well until the halfway mark, where the author descends into a jumbled mix of convoluted reasoning and ill-conceived plot moves that destroys the whole thing. I won't tell you how it ends or how Judith Tarr resolves the stated ""impossible"" problem of her two very MALE princes falling in love, but I will say this; I nearly ripped the book in half when I realized the path she was taking. What an utter cop out."
3,It's actually 2.5 stars but I can't find the .5 button,"For three quarters of the book, I was really enjoying it. So much so, I was going to rate it 4 stars, if not 5. But then the author chose the easy way out of the major problem her two main characters faced - it was such a cop-out, it ruined the rest of the book. I almost stopped reading right there, but decided to finish it since I was almost done. It really is disappointing. What made it even worse was the reactions of the characters to the solution. Suspension of belief only goes so far, even in fantasy novels. It was such a life altering solution, they way the characters reacted to it before it was implemented, during, and after (especially after) was just not believable. It was quite ridiculous actually. I would tell you what the author did, but if I had to go through that annoyance, so do you!"
3,an ok film,the story was interesting and touching but I just don't think this was that great of a movie. I'd recomend Second Hand Lions over this movie the stories are very similar but SHL is better
2,Big Dud!,"Okay. So this movie has its moments. Very magical characters in a whimsical setting... BUT when you put all that fluff aside, the Dad in this movie isn't anything more than a big pompous windbag. The father in this movie just reminded me of all those people that I've bumped into that brag about the same unbelievable things that they have or have done... yet everyone knows that they are just like me and you... boring slobs. For example, when the father blantantly steels his son's thunder at HIS OWN WEDDING! It just makes me cringe. He was no hero. Just an daft old man with a wild imagination."
2,Too Forrest-Gumpish,"This movie felt a little too much like Forrest Gump. The movie definitely carried Burton's stamp with its dreamy, gothic surrealism; fantastical characters; and the familiar lofty themes from Danny Elfman's score. However, the story-line seemed a little too familiar...just a different person telling a tale to a different listener. Is it a coincidence that the main characters in both movies loved story-telling, lived larger-than-life adventures and were from Alabama?Nice approach...but already been done. Skip it."
3,Kind of boring,"This movie had an interesting story but it didn't ever really draw me in, and it ended up being boring, for that reason."
4,"If it's not, it ought to be!","A Cult film, that is. A wonderfully non-conventional bit of story-telling that should be thoroughly enjoyed! Why settle for a ""just-the-facts-ma'am"" kind of life when you can add so much more to the story in the telling. Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor/Albert Finney) becomes the quintessential opposite of Charles Dicken's Josiah Bounderby of ""Hard Times."" In ""Big Fish"" the facts, like gold, are where you find them, and Edward Blooms endless stream of ""fish stories"" may have more facts than his son, William (Billy Crudup) is willing to credit them for. So William, tired of dad's ""fish stories,"" goes on a fact-finding mission to learn where his father's reality ends and where truth begins. What the son learns changes everything for him, maybe you too. Worth more than one viewing, so it's worth owning!"
4,"Great Movie, one for the collection",This is a great movie. Tim Burton making a love/family movie is just the best idea for a film to keep in your DVD/Blu-Ray collection. It's even more fun in HD.
5,My all time favorite movie,"Big Fish is my all time favorite movie. The first few times i saw it, i cried at the end. It's a little slow at one or two scenes, but it's such a great movie. It had a few little funny scenes, but was more a dramatic fantasy film. It's made of a lot of little stories, that all connect with each other. It's more for adults, because if you don't listen carefully, it can be kind of confusing."
2,sappy and tedious,"This movie is a dog. I found the flashback fantasies annoying, sappy, and boring all at the same time. The ""love your father"" moral is laudable, but the execution is painful at best. Don't even rent this one."
2,"Overrated, slow, but good acting","Some of the reviewers have made comments such as, ""this is not for the dumb minded"", etc, or ""how could anyone not like this movie?"".It was not hard to see the metaphors in the movie-that is pretty glaring! I mean, the whole movie is about Finney's character telling stories and it's connection to his life. Kids have apparently enjoyed this film and understand it. So, you don't have to have a superior IQ to view this film.Personally, I couldn't sit through more than 40 minutes of this movie, and neither could my boyfriend. While the acting was very good-it did not touch any nerves with me. I felt it just dragged on, and the characters were rather dull and emotionless. Maybe I missed a significant moment in the film which I was too impatient to wait for. It certainly didnt capture my heart enough for me to sit through it. As far as being a slow, dragged out film, it is pretty much in line with ""In The Bedroom""."
3,Just Not That Good.,"This movie could have been as good as Forrest Gump, but it lacked a great screenplay. There are some great moments, but those moments don't come around often enough. The movie seems to drag quite a bit. Ewan McGregor stars as the young Albert Finney, and he would have been great had the script not led him astray.This movie had a LOT of potential, and I think that is why I was so disappointed.Tim Burton fans might still like it because of the quirkiness of the storyline and filming, but I'm not a superfan of Burton.Save your cash, rent it, don't buy it.See ya next review.www.therunningirl.com"
3,Big Disappointment,"This film has lots of memorable scenes and moments, visually and imaginatively---the problem is that they don't really mesh to form a cohesive whole. Tim Burton's technical prowess is unquestionable, but his storytelling leaves something to be desired.Ewan McGregor (how the Scotsman pulled off the Alabama accent is amazing) and the talented cast do a great job, it's just that the story kind of fizzles out towards the last 30 minutes. All spectacle and no real center, no real soul."
5,I'll rank this as one of my all time favorites,"Maybe I like the movie because I come from a family that values telling a good story. Sometimes the fun is seeing how far you can go with it before the listener catches on. And yes, I've heard some stories about family members that I'm not sure are true or not. But enough about me. I really enjoyed the movie. I don't have complaints about any of it, and at the end I cried sentimental tears for a lot longer than I can remember about any other movie I've seen. I especially like how at the end the son came up with a good story to tell his Dad."
4,What is Truth?,"I liked this movie a lot. True to the book, but smartly changed when it served the visual medium of film. One bit in the book I was hoping Tim Burton would discuss why he didn't take was the thing that really kept people in Spector, the imaginary town. In the book, there's a fierce dog that bites people's fingers off if they try to leave. Very Burton-esque. Couldn't figure out why in the film it was about the shoes.However, I loved the relationship between Edward and Sandra Bloom - both as young people and as older folks. The simplicity of their love and complete acceptance of the other was touching. I thought William struck exactly the right tone, trying to come to terms with his father before the latter's death. All in all, the movie was an interesting juxtaposition of 'real life' and fantasy."
3,"Visual Treat, but Manipulative and Hollow","Tough one for me. I love Burton films and am a big fan of most of the actors. When I watched this, I was ready to be pulled into Tim Burton's dreamy, fairy-tale world and I ... wasn't. Beautiful to look at, nice score, fine actors - but I really felt the schmaltz come through in a mainstream don't-give-the audience-credit kind of way. Burton's best makes you feel as sad, happy, schmalzty as the best of them, but without your feeling so commercially manupulated. There is a depth missing here and sadly, I felt nothing but a pretty surface on this."
3,Movie is great but quality is crap.,"I simply loved this movie and I had to own it on Blu Ray... or so I thought. I actually didn't even bother to read any of the reviews before I got it... I bought it on a stupid whim. I mean, the movie is still awesome... but the image quality is poor. There's little difference between the DVD version of it and the Blu Ray one...I hope they re-release it in high quality as it deserves to be in full HD awesomeness."
4,Love the movie but disappointed in the transfer.,"I loved this movie so much I bought it again blu-ray. I was (sadly) disappointed. While the colors were more vivid, the picture was not as sharp as it could have been. My wife could barely tell the difference. Still, it is better than the dvd version. If you can find it for a decent price, get it. Just don't break the bank over this one."
4,A Heartfelt Treat From Tim Burton,"Director Tim Burton has never really made a film quite this sentimental before and after seeing Big Fish he was long overdue. This film is a very touching and enchanting tale about a father and son trying to mend their paths. Ewan Mcgregor is very impressive in this movie, he just seems to shine with optimistic purity. Albert Finney as the same character in the dusk of his years is equally affecting. The only weak link is Billy Crudup who is very wooden and dry, but the film works nonetheless. There is a magic in Burton's best works, and Big Fish is definatly one of these. Even if your not a regular Burton fan check it out, it may surprise you. If you are a Burton fan and haven't seen it then what's your excuse?"
2,"grossly ascetic, self-indulgent","Big Fish is a creative film. If anything it is fairy tale for adults, a romp in a decadent imagination. In that sense it was fun. But more than anything it left a taste of grossly ascetic self-indulgence in my mouth. The social satire bite that made a strange story powerful in Edward Scissorhands is gone. Instead we have to be content with a childrens book that tells us nothing substantive other than we should let our imaginations run free and value family (or something like that). Where is the depth?"
2,Dirrrrty,"The case and the DVD was extremely dirty. Although, under the description it said a little dirty...I wasn't expecting what I got. The DVD had a thick layer of dirt/dust, it was disgusting. I don't even know how a DVD can look like that. It would have been easy for the owner to take a quick wipe to it so the buyer (me) didn't have to deal with that. Gross.But unexpectedly the DVD did work...so...I'm not that mad."
1,Big Flop.,"My wife and I were very excited to see this movie after seeing the preview. We were very disappointed. The storyline and the dialogue are terrible. The acting, the sets, the special effects, and the music were all very good. But in my book, NONE of those things can make up for a bad script, and they did not make up for Big Fish's very bad script."
1,Spanish subtitles.,"This movie doesn't have the spanish subtitles as stated in the product detail.I've sent emails to customer service saying this but the only thing they do is send me a replacement (which doesn't have the subtitles either).So, if you need them, don't buy this one.Edit your post:This movie doesn't have the spanish subtitles as stated in the product detail.I've sent emails to customer service saying this but the only thing they do is send me a replacement (which doesn't have the subtitles either).So, if you need them, don't buy this one. Guidelines"
2,Yawn,"Went with eager anticipation to see this one. Ended up bored to death, looking at the time wondering when it would all end. Interesting premise, amazing visuals but way too drawn out. I was with 3 other people and we were all disappointed. Expected much better."
4,Something New from Tim Burton,"BIG FISH seems like a big departure from the genre of films that Tim Burton directs. BIG FISH is refreshing if not just a little strange. However, it does not fail to entertain and it does keep you hooked. It is a great set of slices of one man's life and depending on how much truth you think they contain comes the pay-off."
3,Big... Something or Other,"I really wanted to like Big Fish, but I was mostly bored while watching it. It was not a bad movie, and had some interesting moments, but mostly I found the characters to be one dimensional, and I was apathitic to all of them. There was no spark in Big Fish.Good special effects and good acting, but the story kind of held everything back."
1,BIG YAWN.,"I am a huge Tim Burton fan but this is a real disappointment (especially after the debacle that was Planet Of The Apes). Quirky visuals cannot disguise the fact that at the heart of this story is a very annoying central character. If you want to watch Ewen McGregor grin his way through a movie, then this is the film for you, otherwise watch Ed Wood again to see a real classic."
1,not for us,"we viewed this last night after several recommendations and reviews. The visuals and technique are great, as is the acting, but the story and expostion just don't work for us. We were clueless as to what was going on for the first hour, then began to understand what was the theme in the 2nd hr. BTW, our DVD had very significant sound problems for about half the movie. The music was extremely loud, but the spoken parts were almost not understandable until you raised th evolume only to be blasted by the music. This cleared up in the 2nd half by itself."
1,Sorry - I didn't like it,"I had hopes that I could watch this movie with my 7 yr old son.When I saw Tim Burton directed it, I had my doubts. My hopes for a feel-good movie were quickly dashed. Tim Burton continues to be a director I will avoid, yet this was probabibly his lightest work.The plot was simple and transparent. 10 minutes into the movie, the ending was obvious. None of the characters were very overly likable.I tell my son better stories than those in the movie.I would qualify this movie as a ""'B-' rated theme movie of the 80's"" if I could. The ""Brat Pack"" made better ones. It was better than Highlander II, Mortal Combat, Street Fighter, and The Avengers. They got a ""0"" star rating.It would be a good movie to watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon if there the best thing on TV was an old Tarzan movie.On second though, I'd watch the old Tarzan movie.Secondhand Lions was far superior and I should have watched it for the 15 time instead of watching this movie.Sorry, but this is my opinion."
1,This movie stinks,"I like Burton's stop animation work, creative. This story is just a lot of rambling non-sense that's disjointed and boring. Oh yeh, the stories might be true in the end? Revelationary. Nothing interesting happens in this story, and the yarns aren't touching or comical. It's all a silly dance that doesn't work on any level. I'm sorry, but don't waste your time!"
1,Three strikes you're out Tim!,"Tim Burton is on a roll (to early retirement). This is the third dismal movie he has directed in a row. Relying heavily on picture perfect ""aren't we imaginative"" sets that look television commercials quality and less on building some tension and plot Big Fish is as much fun as watching a fish out of water suffocate to death. The biggest offense in this movies is the talk-over narration. Could you imagine a movie like ""The Wizard of Oz"" if we had to listen to Dorothy blab on and on about what she had experienced instead of allowing us to discover the wonders along side her? If you have seen one of those tedious ""In a town called perfect"" tv ads with all the sugary nursery muzak you've already seen Big Fish. Avoid this movie if you have any discretion on how you spend your time."
4,Big Fish - BIG Price!,Love this movie....great story of believing in yourself even when nobody does and great crew of actors besides....BUT..I'm wondering why I had to purchase this for $9.99 when it is old and should have been free being an Amazon Prime customer and credit card holder??? No option to rent it for $1.99 or something reasonable....I did pay it cause we had guests over and they never saw it. But that is my only complaint being a Prime user. Otherwise...rent it somewhere else to save money!
5,This was a good movie.,"I found this film to be very good. It had humor, great characters, and a mysteriously fun story. It involves an old man's tall tales that he supposedly went through, and his son doesn't believe him. So the son goes and actually researches the stories to find out what his dad really went through. He expects to find that his father's tall tales aren't so tall, but......I can't give away what really happens. But it's a satisfying story that I could watch again and again. Can't wait to own it on DVD!Great movie."
5,Amazing movie!,This is such a great movie. You will never get tired of watching this. The imagination behind this story and how it is brought to life is incredible!
4,"Tim Burton's best movie, by far","""Big Fish"" is a wonderful example of what can happen in film making, when imagination, ambition, and production values all come together in the correct ratios. What's most notable about this movie is how vastly different it is from Burton's other efforts. It still retains his quirky signature, which works perfectly with the odd subject matter and story presentation. However, most of Burton's movies have been so similar in content and visual style, that they all blur together for me. With ""Big Fish"", he went outside his comfort zone, and created something more colorful and heartfelt than anything else in his impressive resume. ""Big Fish"" is ideal for anybody who relishes the use of imagination, and yearns for a good yarn."
5,Fabulous,"It is exactly as I expected it to be -- entertaining, fabulous, a marriage of Daniel Wallace's fantastic mind and Tim Burton's incredible vision."
4,Great movie made better on Blu-Ray,"Great movie for anyone who loves a good fantasy/Tim Burton film, looked AMAZING compared to the dvd version that I also own, I'm only giving the blu-ray 4 stars due to lack of special features"
3,"""Tell me who you are, dad.""","-""I'm a pudgy, pasty, emotionless man who couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag, son. Who do you want me to be?""This movie could've been very good, but it wasn't. The characters seem randomly selected and create very little chemistry. The cut and paste plotline isn't well established, either. I wanted so badly to like this movie, but wow, it just drags on and on."
4,It's good because it's different and makes you think,"There's not a lot I can add to what's already been said, and, at any rate, it's not as if anyone is going to read my review (being reviewer no. 227). Anyway, I just wanted to say that I liked the movie because it's not mainstream - it doesn't really fit into any genre. It was fun to watch the story unfold, not really knowing where it was going to take you. I pondered over the movie in the days after I saw it, trying to find ""the message"". In the end, I decided there wasn't one, but at least it caused me to think, and to consider my own relationship with my now-deceased father. If the movie accomplished nothing elese, that was enough. There aren't many movies that make you think after the end credits roll, but this one did (at least for me)."
5,What an Amazing Movie!,"I absolutely loved this movie. First of all, people who after seeing this movie that try to seperate or figure out what was real and what wasnt are entirely missing the point of the movie. Just have fun with it!The characters are amazing in this movie. Whether its the witch with the glass eye or Danny DeVito as the little circus man (he fits right in) or the Giant, the characters are larger than life and are very creative. In Big Fish, all of the characters are pretty central to the plot (in a way) which was another plus. All of the girls I went to the movie with were crying by the end. It was both fun and emotional at the same time. This was an extremely well done movie and I highly recommend it to anyone. If you havent seen this yet, you are in for a treat!"
4,Big stories and those who have to live with them,"Tim Burton has become the master of the fantasy film from ""Batman"" to ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" but now he has turned his attention to a story of depth and emotion. Anyone who one day woke up and discovered that they didn't really understand their father, or know his life story will love this movie. As the film progresses we are invited along a journey of discovery, that of a son learning who his father is, and learning to see past all the ""Big Fish"" stories. Anyone expecting another cartoonish tale from Burton will be disappointed in this film, but anyone who ever lived with or knew a spinner of big tales will love this story. I recommend it for anyone who ever wondered who their father really is, or just love a story with both depth and multiple layers."
3,Dull option when you could choose AUTUMN SPRING,"Lifeless characters who walk in Burton's Oz didn't grab me, and the grotesque reliance on a real giant or Helene Bonham-Carter's gory eye were cliches. When the cast resurfaces for the final scene, I expect to shed a nostalgic tear or feel a pang, but there's nothing but a wishful sense that I wish the film worked (metafiction is usually complex). If you want a film that has heart, real characters, and a social conscience (rooted in real human dilemmas of a single family in Prague), then choose the Czech bittersweet comedy, AUTUMN SPRING, starring a charismatic 75-year old in believable situations where he attempts to enact what Albert Finney fails to bring to life in BIG FISH. Watch the real implications of fish tales with a real storyline, not a rehashed version of OZ."
2,"Alright, at times","I am a big Tim Burton fan, but couldn't really get into this movie. It had spectacular imagery and the acting was wonderful, but story-wise, it didn't really grab my attention and turned out to be dissapointing. Some of the characters were interesting, some annoying and pointless. I definitely liked the 'stories' parts of the film more enjoyable than the present times scenes. I think those dragged the film down. Its sort of a depressing movie when you think about it. I guess you could categorize this as a fantastical drama. At least that is the closest thing that I could think of."
2,I really wanted to like this film...,"Normally, I love Tim Burton films (except for Planet of the Apes), but this one left me painfully disappointed. Basically, McGregor's failed attempt to speak with a Southern accent ruined it for me, particularly since Albert Finney (who plays Edward Bloom in the later years) is a native Southerner and speaks accordingly. The end result: it was extremely hard to believe that McGregor and Finney represented two stages in the life of one character... In fact, they appeared to be two totally different people. Nevertheless, I have to admit that the set design was fantastic."
1,pure doo doo,I am from the south and we don't all speak with exaggerated accents and we don't all lie to get our points across. shame on you tim burton for perpetuating this hateful stereotype of southerners!
2,Falls short.,"Being a huge admirer of Tim Burton's work, I eagerly anticipated seeing ""Big Fish."" However, I was completely disappointed by it. This was supposed to be a very personal film for him and yet it feels utterly impersonal. There is no point at which I was pulled into the story. Although Billy Crudup's character knows his father is dying, he treats him father as a child and seems to have no emotion about the eventual loss. This seemed unbelievable. I was also expecting something more colorful and visually stunning. Expect for one tender scene in which Albert Finney and Jessica Lange are in the bathtub fully clothed together, this film unfortunately falls short of it's potential. It's possible that I had expectation that were too high, but nevertheless, it just didn't grab me."
3,Almost Good,"Big Fish is simple, yet complicated. Intriguing, yet boring. Mystical, yet real. I consider myself an intelligent person and an avid movie watcher, but found myself lost in this film from the very beginning.While Tim Burton is an unforgettable director and Finney, McGregor, and the other actors are crisp, emotional actors, the film as a whole does not completely hold together. It seems as if the bricks are in position, but the cement between them has not yet been applied. The glue holding the film together, a theme, an idea that is universal, is there, but is still only sitting on the ground and not being used to its full potential.So let's just say this: if you are looking for something with deep meaning and complex emotion, this film attempts to appeal to you, but doesn't quite make it. However, if you just want something fun, mystifying, and visually spectactular, Big Fish is it."
3,I don't get it...,"Is there something I was supposed to take away from this movie? Okay, it was different and caught my interest, and well-played by the actors. It is about a son who is trying to figure out who his father really is after years of tall tales and fantastic stories. But at the end of the movie I was left wondering okay, now what? What did the son realize? Is this supposed to tell me something about life or relationships? What was the point?"
5,Simply Beautiful,"This is a great movie. There is not slow or bad part in it. Ultimately it is about a father and son. Having lost my father a handful of years ago, I related right away. You must watch this movie."
2,Gawd Awful,"This movie was cloying, sentimental, sappy, banal, trite and boring. Tim Burton's movies all look alike. And as an Alabamian, the stereotypes of the south were annoying, and at times offensive. Avoid this turkey."
3,skipped,DVD skipped a whole scene. Didn't find this out until the person I gave to as a X-mas gift watched it. Not such a great gift I guess. I Kind of knew it wouldn't play perfect due to the scratches.
2,Eh,"Tim Burton's taste for the bizarre is alive and well here, but ""Big Fish"" is proof that his ability to distinguish the enchanting kind from the weird-for-the-sake-of-being-weird kind has finally slipped. This patchwork movie never quite manages to bring together its random sampling of strange tales and odd characters and the overall effect is an annoyance that drains the wonder out of the wonderous patches and the inspiration out of the inspirational ones.It's just kind of blah."
2,Not what I expected and really not that good,"Tim Burton is a great director and from the previews ""Big Fish"" looked really great. But after seeing it I wished that I had rented the DVD and not bought it. ""Big Fish"" is not really a film that I would think that Tim Burton would make. It more of a story about the relationship between a father and son that have not spoken in many years. The visual are good, but they don't allow Tim Burton to show the viewer what he can do. And he is great director. ""Big Fish"" is an okay, but Tim Burton was allow to show his best work."
2,Dissapointing,"I usually like 'strange' movies, but this one just..wasn't very good. It does have a good plot.. the story of his father..and the wonder whether the stories are true or not. I think this movie had a lot of potential, but I feel that it did not pull it off well. Many of the fantasy parts just seemeed unnecessary and much of the dialogue was bad. However, I did like the end."
4,Sweet and fun,"A delightful afternoon of fantasy that touches the imagination in all of us. This film has charm and fantasy and that is a combination that works (for me). Sorry, if you're looking for cold reality and relationship themes, go see something else. This one is fun and sweet and touching fun. Enjoy!"
5,Amazing movie,Just a good movie all around. Different than most and you are really not sure until the end about how true the stories are.
3,Fish,Good movie. On one of my all time great movies. ewan mcgregor is a great actor. The fantasy was great.
5,What can I say?,"...but I wanted to watch this particular movie. I checked with Amazon (first) and there it was - for a price I was willing to pay. Instant gratification. However, I was hoping to be able to download the movie but it only does so to a kindle. I bought my wife one of those and she says ""it's not for watching movies"". Oh well, you can't win al the time. I can still watch where ever there is an internet connection and device."
3,"Wonderful film, but the transfer is sub-par","This is one of my family's favorite movies and I was thrilled to see that it was available on blu-ray. I eagerly popped it into my PS3 last night expecting a visual treat, but was sorely disappointed by the ""less than blu-ray"" quality of the image. I'm convinced that this is an upsampling of the DVD. There's a lack of clarity in the details throughout the film. If you played the blu-ray and DVD versions side by side, I doubt you would see any difference between them."
4,One of the best,"By far, one of the best movies that has come out in a while. There wasn't a dry eye in the house the night I saw this. I rented it and watched it with some friends and the consensus was that it was even better the second time."
3,&#65279;Beautiful cinematography and excellent casting,&#65279;This is a story of a son's reconciliation with his father. The plot device of using the fantastictales of the father to illustrate the son's frustration with his father is well done. I have a personal dislike for the use of freakish characters such as giants but this was actually well carried out with a Fellini-esque flair. The acting and interrelation betweencharacters were flawless. Overall a good film that provides a heart-warming insight into humanfoibles.
4,Big Fish,"The movie was interesting, funny, and overall very moving. It was incredibly fun to watch, had a great story and was very well acted. Burton is just about the greatest director and he shows his stuff here. Not as dark and strange as Burton's other works, but definately different."
2,Good film but poor image,"It's a very good film, however the image quality isn't very good... some scenes looks like DVD."
4,Embellished Dreams and Aspirations and Truth,"At the time of its release BIG FISH seemed like a big departure from the type of films that Tim Burton was directing. BIG FISH is still refreshing if not just a little strange. Nonetheless, it does not fail to entertain and it does keep you mildly captivated.There are depictions of outrageous to intimate slices of one man's life. Credibility and embellishment is an ethereal thing.Depending on how much truth and perhaps the importance of truth itself is found in these events, there eventually there comes the pay-off. What is really true in life anyway?"
3,A Masterful Film About Lies Some Men Tell,"Tim Burton is a genius and I applaud this film to show that fables, tales and stories told in rural parts of America can have real meaning in the end. The cinematography, art direction, acting and casting are superb. My only trouble with the film is that the stories spun by these rural people, which they pass on to their children and grandchildren are not always the innocent, charming and poetic lore the film paints them to be. They have been responsible for a lot of suffering and pain for a lot of people. They are often the catalist for misunderstanding, prejudice and ignorance we see in much of our society today. This film reminded me so much of my father, who passed away 3 years ago. He was also from the south, like Mr. Bloom in the film. I still feel the effects of the tales he told me as a boy and the pain it caused me and my family as we grew wiser and learned the truth. It was not charming, so in that way, this film did not ring true for me."
3,Big Fish and Little Fish,"The question is: What was there not to like about the elder Bloom? We'd all give anything to have a father like that. The son, well, he needs years of therapy. What was his problem? Well, at least at the end, he got it - but by then, it was too late!"
1,Big Fish?: Big Flop!,"This is one of history's worst movies. It ranks right up there with Pootie Tang. If the cinema where I saw this movie burned, at least I would have the solace of knowing that a print of this terrible movie was destroyed.I am a huge fan of movies with fantasy components(Brazil, Moulin Rouge, etc.)and therefore found it puzzling that I disliked this movie so virulently. The movie flip flops between the present and a story of the dying father to the fantastic stories that the father tells. The problem is the juxtaposition of fantasy and reality. The doses of reality prevent us from properly entering the world of fantasy; and the sometimes bizzare story scenes make us unable to find any true emotion for the dying father.This movie fails on all counts.I strongly suggest that anyone considering seeing, buying, or even renting this movie reconsider.I'm only giving this move a star because I have to."
1,"Two Fish Way, WAY down!!!","If there's a form of torture worse than watching this movie, I can't imagine what it is."
3,A good movie message but a litlle bouring.,A good movie with a message for everyone but don't really interestin.
3,"good intentions, but...","it doesn't really work. i don't know exactly what it is about this film, but it's not great. it's alright,but it just doesn't go anywhere really special.it's not bad, but it's not good either.plus, it doesn't have the cool look of burton's other movies."
4,Pleasant Ride Down Memory Lane,"A great soundtrack to a simple, sweet movie. All of the covers stay true to the originals. The entire CD is listenable all the way through. I remember these songs from my youth and found listening to these remakes thoroughly enjoyable. I am not usually in favor of cover versions but this collection did not put me off as some others have. Very recommended!"
2,an average book,"I have bought this book and read through it; there isn't anything special in this book that isn't available online. The explanation of topics is average, and the book is filled with Java code (I wanted a book that explains concepts and some code) but the amount of code in this book makes it usefuless ESPECIALLY when the source code is not explained. A couple of lines are explained and the rest is left to the reader to figure it out. For example, pages 444-465 (21 pages) of nothing more than Java code, and that is for just one application. If I want to get the code I can simply download it. Books that are filled with Java code and no explanation are plain useless. Every application in the book has 7 - 21 pages of source code. I will be returning my copy to the bookstore today. I am glad I kept the receipt. Vaj.I will be returning to the bookstore today."
5,A Must to beginners,A very nice book with lots of helpful information and code examples. When I first purchased this book I had a little information about J2ME technology and was strongly willing to learn more about it. This book helped me a lot....I do strongly recommend this book to everyone who wishes to advance in J2ME...
4,A good book to read,This is a good book to read even you are familar with J2SE or J2EE. This book and its sample codes enable me to write application codes within a very short time. I appreciate the author's effort to make the J2ME coding easy.
5,Good reference,A very complete J2ME book. It is the most complete book I have reviewed. Serious J2ME developers should find this a great resource. The book is not so technical and boring like many computer books. Overall a great book.
5,Excellent Book - Good introduction & reference,"I really like this book. It was a very detailed introduction to me and is still very useful as a reference.John Muchow explains all the necessary details, such as UI, RMS, timers, HTTP connections and much more. The 700 pages also include a chapter about using midlets on the Palm OS platform - you get a lot for you money.If you start with J2ME or want to improve your knowledge, this book is a must-have. Good work, John!"
4,Carry on the tradition,A long-time traditional New England accompaniment to baked beans. Happy to find it available online after moving out of New England.
5,B & M Brown bread with raisins,"I remembered loving brown bread in a can as a kid. If you've never had it you're in for a treat. My sister in law serves it sliced and tops it with cream cheese, round pineapple slice, and a candied cherry on top. I just slice, warm in microwave, and spread with butter. It sort of tastes like bran muffins but with mollasses. Unfortunately it is hard to find at the grocery store, though sometimes I can find it around Thanksgiving. I was so happy Amazon had it and at a great price. I ordered a case of 6 and shared with family. It arrived on time and in perfect condition, and my family enjoyed it very much."
1,TOTAL freaking rip off!,"When I placed the order....the description said ""12 cans""....sometime after my order they changed to 6! Would have NEVER paid $30 for 6 freaking cans....can get it in the damn store for $3/can. RIP OFF!!!!!"
3,"cook in brentwood,ca","Ok, guys, saw this as an ingredient in a ""Chopped"" episode and had to Google - we are diving in on this intersting local specialty on your recommendations.....made my husband hanker for canned bacon, something we took camping as kids that was salty and disgusting. Thank god it was $140 for 12 on Amazon......brown bread not cheap at $45 for 12 with shipping. Hope we don't have to give to food pantry......."
2,"ill fitting, cheesy sounding","I was expecting much more than this. None of the three supplied sizes of molded ends fit my ears, they just will not stay in. Even if I do manage it, they stick out ridiculously. The dang things are HUGE and very ugly.It is very difficult to tell the right from the left. How hard could it have been to make each side a different color? As it is, they are *silver* colored semi-soft plastic. They have a miniscule colored dot to differentiate sides, but I need a magnifying glass to see it in most lighting.As far as the sonic quality is concerned, they are no better than the $10 pair of generic buds you get at your local five-and-dime. Save your money, don't buy these."
3,Could be better...,"I ordered this bag when I was pregnant with my first son. I LOVED the clean and simple colors and design of the bag and was so excited to start using it. It worked well for a couple months but the trim started coming apart and fraying so much that I was embarrassed to carry it around. The fabric is great though, easy to clean and held everything I needed. However, I wouldn't purchase again though."
3,practice sword,"I haven't learned a sword form before, so bought this to practice. Before I bought one, I tried out one at a local martial arts store, but judging by the picture this one looked better than the other type of wooden sword. A few things that I wanted to know before buying this one was the length of the ""blade"" and the balance point. The blade is 29 inches long and the balance point is 7 inches from the guard (1/4 of the length).Some bad points about the sword I received (don't know if they are alike). The guard wiggles, so I plan to glue it. The blade is apparently attached to the hilt with a wooden pin/post (and glue) which sticks out a little, so I plan to file that down. Given these points, I still think it's better than the other one."
2,"It will give you some interesting ideas, but nothing more.","This book tries to be everything to everybody and ends up being nothing to anybody. Despite its claim, you can not learn to program from this book. If you have very little programming experience, you will find this book very confusing. If you know a lot of progeamming then you will probably be annoyed by the lack of details and the time spent on easy topics. The only redeeming value of this book is that it may give you a few creative ideas that you can develop on your own or with better books."
1,Horrible...,"Half a year ago, I thought this was a good book. Today, I believe it is a really, really, bad, waste-of-money, pathetic un-useful book. I mean, even those free web sites written by nobody are better than it. If you want to learn VB animation, go to Yahoo and search for it. You will find something you like. Trust me."
2,It wasn't that good.....,"I got this book at a store, and although it had some pretty neat looking things in it, it didn't turn out to be all that good. First off, they didn't even teach you code, they just tell you to add some ocx to your program. Secondly, the ocx was messed up!! Also, when they got to the 3D programming part, you had to include into your program something that was written in C++. I was really hoping to learn something from this book, but unfortunately I didn't."
2,Not what I expected,"This book isn't what I expected! Not at all! The cover looks nice, but unless you are more in the advanced stage of VB programming, you won't get this. Most of this book assumes you know everything, and is just showing you how to do stuff. All it helped me to understand was how animation works, but not how to programming"
1,Do not Buy,This book seemed a little intimidating for me. I am just a beggining programmer with little experience in advanced animation. This book was misleading because it told me it was designed for everybody. The author of the book wrote an active x control that the entire book is based upon. This active control is sharewhare and if you want to get one that works with 16.7 million colors he charges you. I paid 60 dollars for the book I'm not paying you 30 more dollars. Also the book does not teach you how to make animation from scratch just use a bunch of DLL files that come with the book. I had trouble loading all and using the dll files and am still having trouble. The version of visual basic he is using is not the same as mine because some of the examples in their he is telling me to stuff that I cant do because it is not in my visual basic 5. I do not recommend this book to anyone.
5,An AMAZING tale! Fabulous for children of *ALL* ages!!,"As if the story wasn't good enough, the pictures are truly remarkable. This is a gift book for people everywhere; you will laugh, smile and treasure this book!!"
5,Absolutely charming and wonderful!,"I had the pleasure of finding this book in the bedroom that I was assigned when visiting friends in Texas about a year ago. I started reading it because it was there, and absolutely could not put it down until I had finished it. I have looked everywhere for a copy with no avail. If anyone knows where I might find one, please let me know. What an amazing reading experience and treat this book is!"
2,Could have been taken to greater length.,"At first I was all eager to get, and read this interesting book, but was however disappointed. I would say that it is too shallow, and Brian Froud's illustrations are not at all convincing since it kind of should look like 'actual' pressed fairies - in photorealistic style, and not pastel colored pixies. They could have done that, and certainly Froud is talented enough, but it does seem rushed. When you compare the quality of this book to 'Fairies' then the later is much better in illustration - knowing it is a different type of book. The idea of the book is a very good one, but it could have been better, however the story itself - all the little entries are funny though."
1,Don't Buy This For Your Children,Don't you DARE buy this book for your children unless they are interested in child pornography. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas since she has a fairy obsession. I received the book and looked through it to make sure it was in good shape. I ripped the bad pages out and wrapped it. There were still TONS of bad pages though. It talks about the author getting kissed on the lips by their uncle and sex! I decided to unwrap it and blot out the bad parts but there was almost nothing left except a few pages so I threw it away. What a waste of my time and money!
5,"Enchanting and Imaginative, and I now Have One!","I just received a copy of this book after quite a search -- cost me $100 to get one! It's worth every penny -- I also have Quentin Cottington's Journal -- get it soon -- I think it will be going out of print, too."
5,Magical!!!,"I came across this book in a small store in Northern Mich. a few years ago, but did not have the money to purchase it. Now it is out of print... If anyone knows how I might obtain a copy.. please email me! I would LOVE a copy!!"
5,A great book which needs to be reprinted,I really regret giving this book to an ex-girlfriend. It was so wonderfully writen and the illustrations were awesome. I only wish they would reprint it so I can buy it again.
5,Flights of Fancy with Lady Cottington's Fairies,"Like collectors of pressed flowers, this book presents itself as a collection of ""pressed fairies"". Very creative, completed in watercolours, this book is wonderful to view and certainly worth owning. The art is fantastic, a must of lovers of art and lovers of fairies, not to mention those prone to flights of fancy.The book is wonderfully presented, with a large soft padded cover it is both beautiful inside and out. Makes a great gift too!"
5,"Absolutely Dark, Delightful&Funny","Absolutely hilarious, all these squashed fairies are a delightful twist to the cute fairies that we were fed on when young. Naughty and fun to read, the contents are silly yet endearing. A book to keep."
2,Not sure I like Pressed fairies,"This is a cute book but I guess I just can't get into the idea of pressed fairies (really because of the symbolism) - the end of the book underscores the impact - there are no more fairies (well, they're dead, pressed between the pages of the book). The book just rubbed me the wrong way I guess - I rather see anything free and alive than caught, tagged, pressed, preserved and dead. Gave this two stars because the artwork is indeed nice and taken with a grain of salt I guess it has some humor - problem is the lack of compassion."
4,"Visually interesting book with well written, amusing story.","This book contains the pyschic impressions of fairies left when Lady Cottington slammed her book shut on them. (The prologue to the book clarifies that no fairies where actually damaged during the process.)Interspersed within the fairy impressions is an amusing story of how fairies affected the life of this woman in her own words. The text is produced to look like handwritten scrawl which adds to the ""authentic"" feel of the diary entries. The writing starts as that of the young girl and ends a"
4,Splat,"I must have a twisted sense of humor, but the idea behind the book made me laugh & buy it. As usual, Brian Froud's watercolors are arrestingly beautiful, and perhaps the discrepancy between his delicate style and the gruesome subject matter heightens the funniness. This is something of a satire on his own earlier work in ""Faeries"".It is not a book for children, though. Don't start reading Angelica Cottington's diary to your little ones, or you might find yourself with a bedtime story you can't finish."
5,what a extrodinary book!!!,"if you are a fairy lover, admirer of Brian Froud's work, or simply interested in fairies, you MUST buy this book. I've wanted it for a while, and just got it today, and i was absolutely thrilled. It was worth every penny; i truly felt like i was reading someone's real journal. Froud captures the fairies emotions perfectly, i can't imagine it being done any better.This book is about a girl ageing from aprox 9 to 20 something. It is her journal where she ""pressed"" fairies, sitting outside her potting shed, book open, waiting for an unsuspecting fairy to land, and then she'd SMACK it shut, capturing the fairy inside. Terry Jones did a beautiful job writing this, and the artwork is amazing.i can't stress enough how wonderful this book is, and i HIGHLY recommend that you buy it now. although i warn you it is not for young children, it contains slightly sexual material inside, it was decent enough for me (a 15-year-old) to read"
4,Very Clever and Amusing work from Terry Jones,"Feministic mania, I suppose, and is reading too much into things. I liken this book, to a small degree, to something Terry Gilliam might contrive. Not exactly, but there's a flavor there. This definitely has a mature Monty Python flavor to it, as all of the former players have gone onto more intellectual, literary pursuits. I found it clever, amusing and rather entertaining."
2,A Kind of Gross Fairy Book,"I don't know, I usually love books about fairies, as a matter of fact I collect them, but this is definatley not my favorite book about fairies. I think the plot is kind of sick, but I must say the illustrations are amazing. I enjoyed when the narrator was young, but once she got older the book turned form cute and gross to just plain gross."
4,DVD CLASSIC MOVIE FROM AMAZON.COM,"I actually saw this movie years ago, and I really liked the friendship that was shared by these three boys. The DVD was received well within the time frame given to me at the time of purchase, the product was received in excellent condition, and it was a reasonable price.I appreciate the excellent product and great service."
4,Great book!,This book is very funny. I have enjoyed reading it and laughing when I see my own life portrayed in the comic strips.
2,Very Disappointing Work from a Wonderful Author!,"I normally love Roberta Gellis's work, but this one almost got wall-banged several times throughout the reading. I only stuck with it out of respect for Gellis's earlier works, including Roselynde and Alinor. This one is poorly thought out and executed. None of the characters rang true; Alex second guesses himself so frequently that I wanted to scream. Desiree's abrupt personality changes made me shake my head in wonder. I could never work up enough interest to care whether or not Vachel actually carried out any of his not well planned schemes. And the love scenes were almost laughable at times....an example is a one sentence paragraph: ""Oh, oh!"" Desiree cried. I am saddened at this below-par work from a normally engaging author and I hope her next book takes us back into the writing and magic of her earlier works. I give this book 2 stars based on my respect for Gellis as an author, not based on my enjoyment of this book at all."
3,Good but not great,"I can see now why this book, when it was first released in print, wasn't readily available -- I doubt the publisher did a huge print run. ""Desiree's"" plot didn't seem as skilfully woven as we've come to expect from Ms. Gellis. The bad guy didn't have the clear-cut, ""I'm in it for me, and here's why"" motivation that her villains usually have. Additionally, the main characters lacked a certain snap and sparkle. Mind you, Ms. Gellis' worst book is generally better than most folks' best...I've been wanting to read this one for quite a while, as there was quite a time gap between the stories of ""Roselynde"" and ""Alinor"", both of which I love. I'd say, yes, read this one, if only to see what a topflight author can produce when she's at 95% of game, and then go read the others in the ""Roselynde"" series, for a treat."
1,Packinghouse Daughter,"We lived in Albert Lea, MN, during the time of the big strike there. I knew there was violence as one of our neighbor's homes had a brick thrown through their front window. But, other than that, I wasn't aware of the attitudes of people toward the packing house workers. I know her feelings were real to her, but as I read it, I wondered if she was being too sensitive. I cannot recommend this book."
2,Ok to watch...not much training,This was more of a spotlight on Carmine instead of true instruction. I really didn't get much out of it.
3,Not insulated,"This is fine if your food can be at room temperature. It's roomy, and I do like that it's washable. However, my lunches include things that need to stay cold for at least 5 hours. That takes at least 2 good-sized ice packs. I'm going to look for an insulated lunch bag."
1,Never Again!,"I bought this product in the twin size to put on my son's mattress, as his room is always the coldest one in the house. The day I received it, we put it on and it NEVER HEATED UP! I followed the instructions exactly, not that they are hard, tried different outlets and followed their suggestions for technical support. It still never worked! Now I have found other reviews on alternate websites with people having some of the same issues. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone!"
5,Clearly the best,"I like the idea of cases. I pay booko bucks for all these gadgets they come up with and I immediately buy cases for them. Case in point, a lady I work with dropped her new phone with no case. The phone was scratched to death. Now she has to live with that phone for like two years. Back to this case, I paid 100 bucks for the Sansa, back in the day. I dropped it yeaterday and the case looks ok, but the Sansa looks great. Great jorb Eforcity!"
3,great games,"i ordered all the bonus packs (6 total software titles). and my 5 year old son loves them. they entertain him for hours. so much learning and fun on so many subjects! i highly recommend them.that said, lets get on the the technical part. i had a lot of trouble getting them to install. some of them froze up. some of them wont autorun. and the Animals one we have never been able to play at all. it is like it ""half installed"". says it is there in programs. but wont open no matter what. so try to uninstall or reinstall and that wont work either. i have sent it back to the manufacturer and havent heard from them yet. my computer is almost 2 years old with windows ME and lots of ram, memory, big hard drive. and even some graphic upgrades done recently. even tried it on someone else's comp with same results.but i still say the problems i am having are worth the fun my son is having with 5 games. and he doesnt even know there is a 6th game he hasnt been able to try yet."
2,"Beware, the Activity Center versions are not whole game","The Activity Center versions of the Magic School Bus games do not have an accompanying adventure. It is very open-ended, just click on buttons and play mini-games. My son lost interest very quickly. If your child likes an adventure/mission/goal to go along with the game, I think there are versions of the Magic School Bus that have those, but not the Activity Center versions. Don't pay full-price for an incomplete game."
2,Buy pads separately!,"The pads that come in this combo are pretty much worthless. The velcro closure is rather small making adjustments limited. Thus they slip and slide a lot. One of the pads ripped from its rivet on the first day with no abuse. The first time my son fell the strap for one of the pad nearly ripped all the way through. These pads might provide protection if you fall over while standing still, but I would recommend getting some thing more durable if you really want to protect your kid. I would have given a one star rating but the helmet is pretty good."
3,Not as tough as the kids.,Received 2 of thses sets for children for Christmas and the knee pads are no longer usable.
4,great helmet,"My son loves his helmet and gear very good and fits comfortably, only thing is the knee pads are too tight."
1,pads,These are very cheap. I bought them for my 5 years son and they were ripped at the straps within 2 days.
2,Plastic knee pads,The plastic knee pads tore off the first time he used them. The cloth they are attached to wasn't strong enough and they tore off in normal use.
2,Razor helmet and pad SET,This says it is suppose to be a combo set with knee pads and elbow pads and all my grandchildren got it the pgk. was the helmet.I triedto get a hold of you to tell you and never got a response. Very dissapointed. Now my grandkids don't have the knee pads and elbow pads they need to wear.what to do??
5,"I want to live in ""Almost""!","Christina Skye brought the Southwest to life for me. This is a town and a story you'll never forget. Just the right mix of romance, suspense and humor. It's not Draycott Abbey, but you will love these characters just as much. Highly recommended."
4,A FUN READ!,"To start with,i loved the cover art.The book was what i had expected it to be,a fun read.Tess O'mara was a character that most women could easily relate to.A woman with a life that appears full but is really lacking.'ALMOST'was a greatplace to set the story.I found that the characters who lived in the town were a great element to the book!T.J.McCall was brilliant!Who wouldn't fall in love with him!? Christina,you hve done it again!The ending was brilliant and very sweet.If you haven't got ""2000 KISSES"" get it."
5,The unexpected,"I have to admit when I picked up this book, the combination of the title, and Y2K theme did not intrigue me. In fact, I thought I was going to finish the novel dissatisfied. I was wrong. What starts off as a trite-sounding plot becomes very really. Ms. Skye fleshed out the characters and made what could have been a cliched plot absolutely wonderful. I felt thrown for a loop when she added the southwestern mystery to an already complex plot. I cannot rave enough about this book. For those of you that read the cover and think (like I did) ""oh, no, will the Y2K hype never end! "" put that out of your mind and settle in for a pleasurable read."
1,OMGOSH! WAS THIS HEROINE STUPID!,"This supposedly intelligent professional heroine went on a $65,000 shopping spree the SECOND she discovered an insane amount of money deposited into her checking account without doing any follow-up on its authenticity during the infamous Millennium Y2K scare. Then, even when she starts to question the deposit, she's STILL writing out checks. If that wasn't bad enough, when the ""bad guys"" (we never find out who they were) begin to hunt her down, her brother and his good friend put their lives on hold and in danger to protect her while she spends her time bitching at them and causing unnecessary trouble. I'm ashamed to say (almost) that I was hoping a coyote would eat her.Besides all that, the story was WAY too slow and drawn out while the plot was terribly choppy. Many multiple sub-plots were introduced and then abruptly abandoned without explanations or conclusions. This book was definitely a waste of time."
3,Terrible Title - Good Book For The Beach Though,"The title of the book put me off, but the story was better than anticipated. This isn't the be-all and end-all of romance novels, but it's good for a quick read. The plot could have been tightened up more - as others have mentioned, the ancient Native American flashback sequences seemed to be just dropped into the storyline without any explanation as to why Tess, an apparent Boston native, would be subject to them. Also, the ""bad guys"" were a little too faceless. But Tess and TJ had the requisite romantic appeal, the town was interesting, and the story flowed easily."
5,Awesome,2000 Kisses was a very exciting book with romance and murder anything you want is in this. I am a male and yes I do like romance. This is a book that kept me interested from beginning to end. GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT
2,Fluff!,"This book is slightly more intellectual than your typical trashy novel. Its characters are shallow, the plot is poorly developed and filled with holes, the dialogue is trite, and the sex scenes are tacky. At best, this book serves as mindless entertainment while on the beach--readers in search of thought-provoking depth should turn elsewhere!"
2,Silly!,"The major qualm I had with this book, besides it's ludicrous plot, was either the fault of an editorial error or the author's liberty in writing fiction--the 1st of January was on a Saturday, the author has it on a Sunday. Yes its a miniscule matter over which to gripe, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. On a lighter note, who wouldn't love to blow the better portion of $1M?"
1,I Hated This Book,This nook is a waste of money and a waste of time. It is boring from the first chapter all the way to the last. What makes this book even worse is the whole Native American soulmate concept. That was just stupid. It seems as if the author didn't even care about the quality of her book. I'll never read another of her books.
3,"Cute, Awful Versions of Christmas Favorites, Not a True MP3 Player","First and formost, this is not a true MP3 player! You can not transfer your own music to this ornament. The Amazon description does clearly state this!I was given the Hallmark ""MP3 Player Personal Audio Christmas Ornament"" as a gift last year. It is cute and looks nice hanging on our tree, but I cringe every-time someone wants to play one of the prerecorded songs. It includes four songs:""We Wish You A Merry Christmas"" - A very slow country version, just bad""Jingle Bells"" - Not sure what style they were going for, very bad""Deck the Halls"" - So depressing, the worst of the lot""O Christmas Tree"" - No vocals! The best one on the ornamentSo, with 3 out of the 4 songs being just awful, I really can't recommend this as anything other than a very cute but hopefully mute ornament.CFH"
4,a real page turner...(how cliche!),"sex, violence, and deception\! I thought it was a great book. Passed it on to many friends who also enjoyed. I am looking forward to more titles by this author!"
2,Sinawli Spartan Alley Cat,"Hello! This is Hock. This very old video was part of a old training set. Without the other fundamentals, it is not worth much at all. Instead? I would search on my name, W. Hock Hochheim on the internet and see all the new, improved material, in training order and on DVD! That is where I would spend my money. This whole subject has been completeley reshot, redone and is so much smerter and better on the newer DVD...and cheaper too!"
4,Forget Shiny Toy Guns...,"The moderately famous single ""Major Tom (Coming Home)"" led me to this disc, and the rest of the playlist didn't disappoint. If you're stylistically opposed to upbeat '80s new-age synth rock, there isn't really much here for you, but genre notwithstanding many tracks are quite addictive in English or German. Within the synthesizers and power-set drums, there is a bit of variation in style, from the well-executed middle-of-the-road fast-rock of Noah Plan to pointedly bright and simplistic U.S.A., to an unusual take on experimental reggae in Lifetime Guarantee. Silent Night is the worst fit on the album, but even it is variety (how many times do you ever hear '80s synth spoken-word jam in German?). Overall, an enjoyable listen so long as you know what you're getting into."
5,Delicious!,I am totally hooked on DELON body butter...it works...pure and simple! I've never had a body butter that moisturizes better! Sherry Dorn
4,Australian Customer,"Although the product lived up to expectation and I would love to purchase more however, the shipping cost was excessive"
5,"practical, well-written, concise.","Finally, a book about action research that gets right to the point. It provides a good overview of action research in the context of other research paradigms. It describes many very simple and practical methods for collecting data. It can be used with a thesis or dissertation as well as short research projects."
3,"Good book, but not good publishing limitation.","The book is useful and informative and will definitely help to understand the concepts behind action research and how to use them effectively in all fields. My only qualm is with the fact that you can only download the Kindle edition to your Mac, PC, or iPad. I have a Kindle, which I expressly got to use for school books, and I do not understand the reasoning behind not allowing me to send this book from my computer to my Kindle device. I was required to get this book for class in a short amount of time, so downloading it was my best option. I don't mind utilizing my computer for reading, but Sometimes it won't be useful to have my computer in certain circumstances. I hope that the publisher opens up access sooner rather than later because they may have a returned copy on their hands pretty quickly."
1,Sent wrong book,I am very upset because this was listed as third edition but it is not! I have not been able to use this book for my class! I am very annoyed!
2,Help!! I'm falling apart at the seams---,"Love Johnson's book, but unfortunately it has been used for only Chapters 1 and 2 and it is falling apart at the spine???????Bought brand new and not abusedHopefully it will last through class/December 11th-Not happy, purchase price 44.00 plus tax and shipping-----ouchFYI Grad students have NO money!!!!"
5,Very Good piece of work,"This is a fine example of Jeremy's work, I feel this young man will only get better and better. I would strongly recomend giving this disc a spin but make sure you have the time because I don't think you will want to be interupted once you start."
3,Non-descript,"Was hoping for more, but there's no edge here, nothing that grabs you. It's basic, vanilla, stuff straight from the Shawn Mullins playbook.Pleasant, inoffensive, but ultimately boring."
2,I agree with the music fan from the San Francisco Bay area,because I do remember when Toback was playing the LA club scene with his bass guitar. His former intensity is not experienced on this record.
5,It was even better then Cry of the Wolf,"I really enjoyed this book and thought it was great yet it was quite long, still it was a good book. Wierd things are happening at Ravenswood and to Adriane as this ghost wolf attacks her, not to mention Dreamer as well. Adriane goes on a adventure with her friends to save Ravenswood, the mistwolves, and Storm, but will she be able to save them on time?"
5,Just Buy It,"This is perfection. How a band can put out something so amazing as their first album blows me away, but Alkaline Trio have done it. Amazing lyrics, great music, powerful raw vocals, and plenty of ups and downs in the songs to keep you entertained and leave it on repeat for the rest of your life."
5,Wow,"Amazingly lyrics, breathtaking chords and 12 great tracks. Possibly the very best album i own. If in doubt as to whether or not to buy this record, don't be. One of the greatest. Well done to the trio."
4,Solid Release,"Very catchy emotional punk, on Asian Man Records? Huh, well any way, this album is worth a listen. I do think that some of the lyrics seemed out of place (Kiss your Clavical for example, just never thought someone would refer to a collar bone like that in a punk song). Anyway, it's short, sweet, and worth the price of admission."
3,"-Baby words, great drawings","I love the 4 drawings for the seasons, which are hard to explain to some students. The sun and moon pages are great too. I wish that some of the words less common. Like papa is a bit boring.Nice to color"
1,"Received expired product, check ""use by date"" if you order","I received a 5 pound bag today, March 9, 2011 that had a ""use by 2/2011"" on the package.When I contacted Amazon they credited me back the charge. Great customer service but would be hesitant to order this product again. If you order it I suggest you check the ""use by"" date on the packaging.Opened package, had a strong chemical/plastic smell, tossed it in the dumpster."
4,Good but not great!,In terms of the taste; not quite as strong a licorice flavor as I would like. In terms of the amount; a real bargin.
2,Strong flavored licorice lovers beware,"I've developed a taste for licorice over the years starting with the Italian licorice chips, wonderful strong licorice flavor there.... then I tried the Australian licorice, soft and chewy with good flavor, then I tried the licorice coins, firmer texture but strong, very good, unusual licorice flavor, and finally the Haribo Licorice wheels, firm , almost crumbly texture I didn't care for, and definitely the weakest licorice flavor (but good fragrance).... reminded me of the automatic bread maker I had a while back, the bread always smelled better than it tasted!"
2,Judy,"I did not care for the flavor of this licorice. It has a very mild artificial licorice flavor. If you want real licorice flavor tryDarrell Lea Original (Black) Soft Eating Liquorice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 8)It costs a lot more but it is fantastic.Judy"
5,Very good black licorice,I've gotten these and Red Vines European style licorice at different times. These are way better. Recommended for all black licorice buffs.
2,Not very good,"If you like black licorice flavor ,you won`t like this.It is soft and fresh but just not much taste."
3,Somewhat Flat Licorice Wheels,These Licorice Wheels are OK. Maybe I expected them to be sweeter - like the Twizzler brand. But they're not.
1,taste like nothing,This what they call licorice has no taste at all its sticky slimy and its a shame that they call it Dutch licorice The only good tasting one they made is the beagle licorice.I will never buy there products again the quality is gone
1,Critique by Kayt,"This licorice was nice and soft, however, it had a more anise taste than licorice. It was very salty. I would not buy it again. Red Vines is much better."
3,"Not terrible, but somewhat tasteless. Real black licorice fans should seek out Haribo's Pontefract Cakes instead","These licorice wheels aren't bad. The texture is great, and the flavor is OK. But it's just OK. Not particularly pronounced, and sadly a little to similar to the fairly tasteless (or artificial tasting) American stuff that you typically find.Haribo actually manufactures a very very good black licorice, the Pontefract Cake:Haribo Gummy Candy, Pontefract Cakes, 6.6- Pound Bag. THAT is a real, deeply satisfying licorice bite. Made the way that licorice has been made (in Europe, anyway) for centuries.These? OK, but too modest."
3,"Haribo Gummi Candy, Black Licorice Wheels","I purchased a five pound bag for my husband who loves this stuff, licorice. Crazy, you should never get this much unless you have another use for it because all licorice is not the same. Guess, you get my drift here. Yes, you are right he didn't really care for it."
2,Great texture but no flavor,Im a big licorice fan - especially soft and chewy. This Haribo is a great price so i tried it. It was very fresh and chewy but really has no flavor outside of a slightly chemical taste.
2,Unpleasant Aftertaste,"I've consumed quite a bit of licorice over the years. I'm not a connoisseur by any stretch of the imagination but I know an unpleasant taste when it's in my mouth. The Haribo Gummi wheels start off very well, great bite and chewability, very nice initial flavor. But.... every now and then (not always but enough to warrant not buying again) I got a nasty sulpher-like bloom on my palate. So: Caveat Emptor"
2,Wouldn't buy Again,"I'd have to say the taste is bland (not a rich black licorice flavor) it's not very sweet or juicy, and has a peculiar after taste. Not something I would recommend, or buy again."
4,"A silly, but fun mystery","Emma Rhodes, Private Resolver, hob-nobs with kings and queens and other aristocrats in this debut mystery. I enjoyed it, in spite of the 'brand name dropping' throughout. Say champagne, you don't have to refer to the brand! Oy! I definitely will read the follow up which I already have in my possession."
2,"Thick, but of mediocre quality","Granted, this may be the most extensive collection of Atget's Paris work in one volume, but the quality of the photographic reproductions leaves a lot to be desired. Although not as exhaustive, Andreas Krase's ""Atget's Paris"" contains beautiful, high- quality reproductions of a large number of Atget's Paris photos. The Krase book also contains a very well written and informative essay on Atget's personal history and work. For true Atget junkies, you may want to own both; but if you can only have one, or if you want the one that best ""transports"" you into Atget's paris, go for the Krase book. ...and finally for real buffs of old Paris photos (especially pre-Hausmannization), you may try to seek out the work of the photographer Marville (good luck, unfortunately it seems his stuff is out-of-print at present), or the Panaromanic Photograph collection in the ""American Memory"" collection of the Library of Congress..."
2,Can't a better watch be made?,Apparently all talking watches are the same as this one. It works for about a year and then the sound fades away. Changing batteries does not help. Can't anyone make a superior talking watch that can last for several years?
4,short review,as I don't have much time right now - it will suffice for me to say that this is one of the quality releases. as opposed to some forgettable ones.
3,Very enlightening content poorly written in a New-Age daze.,"This book is heralded by some to be the new artifact that has the answers to life. Whatever! Though the content is worth the reading and contemplation, do not be mislead by the motives of the author. This is yet another piece of New-Age material that too many trees have been wasted on.There is a real message in the book that I believe Redfield happened to stumble upon by accident, or perhaps he heard of true spiritual accounts and tried to immitate them in this book. Keep your wits about you, and be discerning. He should have left these lessons to be taught by those who have had these experiences, or to a real author, who would have put the information across much, much more effectively.As I said before, find the truth in the book, because it is worth the few bucks, but do it only if you are able to ignore the money-making scheme of it."
4,Ummm,"How exactly has the first reviewer been able to comment on the 2004 version, as it has not been released yet? Anyhow, the previous version is a great product, so hopefully Microsoft didn't mess it up. Easiest to use, and most powerful, off-the-shelf desktop GIS out there. And believe me, I've bought them all...Maptitude, BusinessMap 3 from ESRI, etc. While Mappoint does not have as many customization options, it is MUCH easier to use, and comes bundled with good demographics dataset. Here is hoping that the new version has really updated the streets, freshened the demographics, and has incorporated a web update feature. Users of Arcview, forget about it, this will seem like a joke to you, Arcview is the best (but a real bear to learn)."
3,Stand-alone only sucks,"For many years, I've used the Microsoft Map feature of Excel. It's a great little tool that only does a few things but served its purpose well, and on occasion even justified using Excel rather than SPSS or some other data-management tool.Then came OfficeXP, with an Excel version from which Microsoft has stripped that Mapping tool. Now I have to pay hundreds of dollars and gets lots of data I don't want or need (and could find much of on the web anyway)? No thank you.Time to find an alternative..."
1,$269 for this GARBAGE?,I wouldn't pay $2.69 let alone $269.00!!!! for this dreadful program. It is NOT user friendly. The data mapping is worthless. This program makes Street Atlas 2004 (mediocre mapping program) look like the best thing since sliced bread.Don't waste your money!
5,Fabulous Collection,"This book is a unique anthology, a remarkable compilation of quotations from a marvelous collection of writers. I will enjoy reading it again and again for years to come."
1,Useless,"The translations are adequate, but who likely to purchase this book would be satisfied without the original French? For quotations, many of which are epigrammatic, this is essential because the translations are never going to capture or reproduce their Gallic concision and lucidity. The English is there just to get you in the door, but without the French to savor, what's the point? And if you don't know any French at all, you just read the rectos. And another thing. The single entry Ms. Dingle offers from Descartes is ""I think, etc."" Most useful. Overall, a much better choice is A Book of French Quotations With English Translations, compiled by Norbert Guterman. It's out of print, but still available very reasonably from used book dealers. It does lack a subject index, which I've always found annoying."
3,a good insight into the indian struggles,"This book gives the reader a good overview of the history of the struggle of the native Americans for survival and adaptation in the face of the relentless pressure put on their peoples by the onslaught of immigration from Europe. The book is well balanced and helped me to comprehend what were the challenges faced by the native populations here in America and how they adapted to these challenges, in order to survive. Its a good place to start for anyone interested in this topic."
1,voice changer 2 (phone),"I can't get it to work ... changed batteries twice... nothing..I've e-mailed person I purchased it from but I still haven't had an answer yet maybe to busy. I will wait to see what happens... If I still don't here from person I purchased it from, I will e-mail again as to where It was purchased from...."
1,Voice Changer 2,What a Horrible useless product. Why do they even bother selling it. It is a Joke an expensive one at that. I lost out on 10.00 for S@H charges.They did refund to me the price of the voice changer 2 but I was still out $10.00 for returning the item I do not reccommend this product.
4,"don,t let the title turn you off","Stephen Hunter wrote some of the best action novels of the '90s, and Dirty White Boys is a prime example. Set some time aside and give this one your attention. If it's your first Hunter book, you'll be back looking for more. Enjoy!"
5,An Awesome On-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller! I loved It!,"Lamar and Odell Pye, two cousins break out of a jail in Oklahoma and leave a trail of destrtuction across the states of Oklahoma and Texas, looting and shooting up virtually every town they encounter. Stephen Hunter is a genius when it comes to keeping a reader hungry for more action in his numerous books. I have read six of his books and consider this the most exciting of them all. I cannot wait for his next book to come out."
5,Best of the Great,"I was 100% a Bob Lee Swagger fan and reader. But this is what the library had at one time, so I checked it out, and Oh Wow!!! Most intense story telling I have read in a long time. I can't believe I'm saying this but this is SH's best. This got me to read the Earl Swagger series, and they are fantastic as well. There is a theme this book ties into. Read them all, for SH is a master of intertwining rawbone suspenseful thrillers."
4,Fast-paced and action packed.,"This book was really cool. You can complain all you want about the first paragraph being disgusting, but you have to admit it hooks you right away. I loved the insights into the criminal mind: especially in how Lamar set up the Denny's robbery. The only thing about this book that disappointed me was that Bud Pewtie's run in's with Lamar were a bit too coincidental."
2,Book lacks a moral rudder,"Hunter writes with a lot of energy and adrenaline, but the book is shallow. It reads like one of those empty-headed action movies starring Bruce Willis. I probably won't be reading any Stephan Hunter books after this one, but I am half-curious what he could do if he wrote something more worthy of his obvious talents."
1,Godawful,"I stopped at page 50. Poorly drawn characters-him bad, him good- and I didn't care about a single one of them. Read real crime writers like Elmore Leonard or Ross Thomas instead."
4,"""Dirty White Boys"" for sure.....","Good action book! My 1st Stephen Hunter novel!Contrary to what other reviewers have said, this book is not really part of the Earl Swagger / Bobby Lee Swagger series. Earl Lee Swagger is mentioned once throughout the entire book. There are no prequels to read before you decide to read ""Dirty White Boys"" or after.""Dirty White Boys"" is a good read, alot of action and great characters! The Pyes (Lamarr & Odell) are dirty white boys, poor white trash in every meaning of the words! They are ruthless killers & will stop at nothing to get what they want.The book is very well written and I was impressed with the (come full circle) type ending! You will be cheering on Trooper Bud Pewtie to catch Lamarr and Odell. The shootouts in the book are very well written and keep your full attention.Im' looking forward to reading more books by Stephen Hunter, especially ""The Master Sniper"" & ""Point of Impact"
4,My First Hunter Book - Definitely Not My Last,"This the first Hunter book I've ever read, and it won't be the last - I plan to start from book one of the Swagger series very soon. From the opening of Dirty White Boys, the reader is hooked. I've read some reviewers complain that the book is overly violent. It is what it is - a great tale about a hardened convicted killer, his retarded cousin and a meek psycho and their escape from a state penitentiary. As would likely occur thereafter, they ruthlessly attempt to remain free and will hurt or kill anyone in their path. One cop on a mission - to the point of obsession - remains on their trail throughout. Great writing, sharp characters and plenty of action. This isn't a book for deep thinkers - it is escapism at its best!!"
5,Great Read.,This is the first book I have read by this author but for sure won't be the last. Merry Xmas and Happy New Year
4,Great for a non-Swagger Novel,Great story. Lots of action. Some of Stephen's non-Swagger novels are dull and drawn out (Second Saladin) but this one keeps the pace. Lamar makes a great villian who you can root for at times but ultimately want to see Bud put a 9 mm through him. Has a little tie-in with other books because Lamar's dad was killed by Earl Swagger (Bob Lee's dad).
4,Hunter's best,Mr Hunter's best novel. Crash and burn with balls to the wall all the way to the end! Fun story and quick paced.
2,overwrought characters,"I am a big Stephen Hunter fan but this book was so over the top that I almost couldn't finish it. And some of the dialogue was laughably bad. Too bad,it got off to a great start. A little restraint and credibility would have made this a much better read."
3,Dirty Language,This is a hard one for anyone with an I.Q. of over 100 to get into. The use of bad language and violence runs fierce.However... It's interesting enough to make you keep reading because a good manhunt makes for an interesting action tale.I've now read most of Hunter's books and I am beginning to find a repetitive pattern towards his 'heroes' as they all look and act like John Wayne and love to commit adultery.
2,Nothing better than OK,"I was very entertained the first two thirds of the book, knowing there are actually prison cons that are just as crazy and tough as Lamar. I also personally know about 5 Texas Rangers and State Troopers. I would be the first to agree they are tough as nails..but come on, Bud should have met his maker about 7 times during the book. Any law enforcement officer would agree. The last one third of the book was ""corn"". The thing with Holly is over the top. She sounds too much like a ""fatal attraction"" little twit that just needs to go get a life. Having sex with Lamar would have probably made her stalk Lamar and they could have lived happily ever after. This book could have been superb but I think the author got a little carried away with the ""Bud tough guy thing"" or obsession with the 9 lives. I would try other Hunter books but I don't think I could handle anymore unreal scenerios."
4,"Not Hunter's best, but still better than most","I have yet to read a Stephen Hunter novel that I did not love. This one is not my favorite, but still beats the competition in the market place with no problem."
4,Bad guys---bad facts,"A book to stay up with---I enjoyed the hard action, the reality of life with vicious animal mentalities. The problem with the book?A serious lack of research and inaccuracies. I am a veteran Oklahoma Trooper, stationed in the book's locale. There were many disappointing factual mistakes which marred what would otherwise have been an excellent novel"
3,For,"I generally enjoy Hunter's writing, but he must stop using the word, ""for."" For example, Hunter must cease using ""for,"" for it really drives me crazy. An editor needs to catch this/have a ""for"" intervention.This book is rough, but a fun read."
1,Not as pictured,"Product is not as pictured. Does not fit our toyota tacoma 96 that has a seat exactly like the picture. When it came we were disappointed to find that it came with covers to fit 2 single seats and 4 head rest covers. The quality was also poor, I have better quality seats covers for my Subaru which i got at target for 26 bucks. I hate writing bad reviews, but this item is just not as pictured."
3,Cheap printing,"I haven't read the stories yet, my comments are strictly on the illustrations. I love the illustrations of P.J. Lynch, and have purchased many books simply for those. I wondered why this book was so cheap, and now I know. It is printed on cheap paper with no color at all, which of course means the lovely illustrations look very poor. It's very disappointing, so if you do purchase this book, make sure it is for the stories, not the artwork, or try and find a full color printing with better quality."
4,OK Dan Marlowe novel with a publishing quirk . . .,"Like many of the great hard-boiled/noir paperback writers of the 1950s-70s, Marlowe's output was uneven, ranging from masterly to less than inspired. Killer with a Key is somewhere in between. As with the other Killain novels, characterization is strong and there is plenty of mood and action. The plot . . . well, you judge. For this reviewer, the book is well worth reading. The publishing quirk is a dilly. The novel ends in mid-sentence, after the denoument, but before the emotional elements of the story have been completely wrapped up. [...] books are known for their typos. It's part of the adventure. But this abrupt ending may be a bit much for some readers. I prefer to believe that it was Dan Marlowe's way of saying, ""you know Killain, write your own ending."""
3,Sweet Slag - 'Tracking With Close-Ups' (Sunrise Records),"UK progressive band's sole album, originally released in 1971. Heard about this CD from a friend who is a major fan of pretty much any music in the progressive vein. Tunes here that I thought were okay include the ten-minute ""Rain Again"", ""World Of Ice"" and the jazzy, yet still good to hear ""Babyi Ar"". Line-up: Mick Kerensky - guitar & vocals, Jack O'Neill - bass & trombone, Paul Jolly - clarinet, flute, oboe & sax and Al Chambers - percussion."
5,Ambient and unrelenting,"A bit of a forced ""sequel"" to Music for Bondage Performance. What makes the album good to listen to is that it is every bit as unrelenting as his power electronics, but a different texture altogether. It has the same menacing darkness as the first Bondage release. If Music for Bondage 1 was a spooky funhouse, then Music for Bondage 2 is a spooky roller coaster. You really want to get off but you came to enjoy the thrill. Really not dissimilar Music for Bondage Performance 1 except for the aggressive nature of loops. This disc's source material is more obviously found sound, while the first Bondage disc had a lot of recorded improvised tapes like the Ecobondage LP. Also the music on this disc is much more layered.The last track on this disc is a takeout from the first Bondage release. It can be listened to to compare the style of his late 80's early 90's experiments to his one's from 1993 and 1994. What a difference a year can make with Merzbow."
2,It's a novelty Item,I bought this as a novelty thinking it would be fun at hunting camp and it said it kept contents for up to 24 hours... Well that's not true. I've been using it almost everyday for 2 weeks now and at best it holds temp for about 4 - 5 hrs before the contents start changing temp. It does come with instructions that say for best results pre heat or pre cool the thermos before use...But really? pre heat or cool a Thermos?!?!?! I'd give it 3 stars because it's still pretty cool looking but as far as functionality... 2 stars at best.
1,I was left frustrated and annoyed,"This is one of the least useful books I have read in my 10+ years in the IT business. Written from an academic standpoint, there were few useful examples offered and no subject was discussed in enough detail to be useful. Examples were vauge at best.While this book got me excited about the topic of document automation, I am unable to create a custom Smart Document solution from scratch after reading this book from cover to cover.Buyer beware: This is a ""What Is"" book, not a ""How To"" book."
4,Good Book,Pretty good book. More code examples would have been better. One thing to note is that I don't necessarily think this book would be good for a brand new beginner.
4,Good Book to get Started with Word Automation,I've read the majority of the content of this book and I have found it to be very useful. The author's coverage of the basic of WordProcessML is excellent. The first seven chapters contain good examples of how to automate Word.
4,as i expected,"purchased this to use at work for a safety lockout lock. Works well, only draw back being the key must remain in the mechanism while the lock is open."
5,Love this Lock,I have had this lock on my jetski trailer which is kept outdoors for over a year and it still works as smooth as the day that I bought it. I am afraid to go back to a brass lock because they have rusted on me and get stuck. Not this one. I can see it working for years to come.
2,Light weight security,"This is the second one I have purchased. My husband and I use them on our bikes and they're much lighter than the brass master locks we used to use. We had the first one for a couple of years and in spite of being exposed to the weather it still works great with no problems, so I got one for my bike. UPDATE: After a couple of uses I had trouble getting the key out of the lock. It has been 3 months and now it takes 5 minutes of jiggling to get the key out of the lock (sometimes longer). The lock is defective and I can't use it. Waste of money!"
5,An incredible journey,"Before reading The Quiet Room I knew very little of mental illness and its effect on people. This book has given me a better understanding of a person's world who was dealing with schizophrenia. I could not put it down for one second! I think that it was very well-written and had a lot of surprising twists and turns. This book is especially astonishing to me simply because of the fact that Lori had written it herself. For someone who was once so sick and mentally disturbed, I feel that she was very brave to have lived it all again while informing others of this horrible disease and what it can or cannot cause. This book gets a tremendous two thumbs up from me!"
5,I highly recommend this book!!,I thought this book was wonderful! Very informative. The author did a great job at explaining and describing mental illness. I could not put the book down. I have recommmended it to many people.
4,The Quiet Room,"While spending the summer as a camp counselor at the age of 17, Lori began hearing the Voices. They repeatedly told her she was worthless, everyone hated her, and told her to die. She tried to hide her symptoms as long as possible, believing that everyone else heard voices also. She was able to make it through college, before she became overwhelmed and attempted suicide. At first her parents though she was under stress, that she was going through a phase and expected her to snap out of it after a bit of rest and relaxation. Instead, Lori began the revolving journey from hospital, to half-way house, and back again as she struggled in a seemingly hostile world.From shock therapy, to talk therapy and endless medication Lori spiraled rapidly out of control. Told from multiple point of views, the book explores the effect of schizophrenia on the patient, their family and friends. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in mental health, or affected by the disease."
5,Honest and Realistic,"Lori Schiller describes first hand what it is like to be tormented by schizophrenia.This is an honest, compelling and realistic documentation of her own struggle with mental illnessand how it affected her family. This book is hard to put down. Warning - this book is not for the feintof heart. It is extremely graphic."
5,"Couldn't put it down, brought excellent understanding","I could not put this book down...one of the best I have read on any mental illness. What makes this one so unique is each chapter was written by a different person and how they were affected by schizophrenia....mom, dad, psychologist, friend, brother, and many by the patient who wrote this book. Really brought in a clear understanding of how all are affected by this disease and what it really looks like in the day to day life. The best part is after reading a entire book of discouragement and what seems to be hopelessness, it ends with great hope!"
5,INSPIRATION!! GRIPPING! EYE OPENING!,I'm a psychologist. I attended a seminar several years ago and had the pleasure of meeting this author and hearing her speak. What a courageous soul! The book was excellent; she told her story well! For those of us who are so-called 'sane' -what a shocker to have a personal glimse into how devastating a mental illness can be and how much of an uphill struggle it can be for people like her. What an eye-opening experience! I give her much credit for her battle and she has come out triumphant!!!
5,Can you smell the Breweries?,"Although I have not enjoyed the construction on the Marquette interchange, I am excited about many of the new faces Milwaukee is revealing. I think we are underated and have a lot to offer tourists. Buy this book and pay us a visit."
3,unsure,"This used to be the only shampoo and conditioner I used for years (like 10+). Hair stylists always commented on how healthy and beautiful my hair was. Then under pressure from a new stylist to change products because I had just highlighted my hair I switched to Redken. After a while I tried to go back to my beloved Citre Shine. It was awful! I don't know if my hair changed that much or if they changed the product, but it caused tons of build up on my hair from my styling products and made my hair sticky. I think if you don't style or use product in your hair this is a wonderful product."
1,Terrible waste of paper.,"I rate this book five black holes, the opposite of stars. This book is about as thought provoking and as shallow as a Calvin Klein commercial for Contradiction. I'm certain the commercial inspired the author to write the book. Imagine a group of models whispering I'm willing to admit mistakes, yet unapologetic; I'm competitive and tenacious, yet flexible and generous; I'm gutsy and a little wild, yet modest and in control. Oh brother! I expect to see this book really soon on the bargain shelf. Definitely a dud, don't waste your time reading it."
3,GOOD IDEAS BUT DIDN'T TEACH ME TO THINK LIKE A CEO,"The author is very personable and enjoyable to listen to. However, I think a more appropriate title would be, ""How to be a near perfect CEO, if you are already a CEO."" I expected this book to provide insight that might take an average person and help them to acquire the mindsets that drive profitabilty and other skills that propel one to become a CEO. I didn't find that in this book. There are some useful ideas in this book though. Am I glad I read it? Yes. Would I buy it if I had it to do over again? Well, maybe I'd borrow a copy from the library."
5,A MUST-HAVE FOR MANAGERS!,"D.A. Benton's book is the Bible of how to manage and lead for young guns. I read every page, word for word, and cannot wait for her next publication. Her wisdom, experiences, and thoughtful advice are blessings in the corporate world."
1,Good for a laugh!,"I bought this book with the good intention of improving my CEO skills. Mistake!Twenty pages into the book I began to suspect it was a send-up. By the time I got to the section on how to approach a chair, I was convulsed with mirth, and was absolutely certain it was an elaborate practical joke.This book has elaborate advise on some of the most idiotic things I have ever encountered in a business book. Such as ones attitude to the car park, and how to touch an employee when thanking them.If you want to have your colleagues in fits of laughter then I strongly recommend this book. If you need to read this type of material to become a better CEO, then I strongly recommend re-thinking your career."
3,Not as good as Benton's previous work,"I thought highly of Benton's previous book, ""Lions Don't Need to Roar"", and expected to like this one even more. Unfortunately, this book is dominated by anecodotes, and I just didn't think it was as useful as ""Lions..."". It's readable, interesting, and has some good ideas, but it isn't a must-buy, or even a must-read. I'd give it two-and-a-half stars if I had that option. I hope to see better things in Benton's next book."
1,I wouldn't buy it again,"Little information, even less original, presented too long. I was bored after 50 pages. Nevertheless I read it through but it was waste of time invested."
5,Read it! Be it!,"This is a great audio tape, marvelously read from a well thought out book. Like many books that are designed to assist leaders in their development it states what we all should take as common sense but don't. It allows leaders to adjust if possible and it allows team members to decide if they are riding the right horse on their journey to success. I immediately ordered the authors other works after listening to this tape. Great stuff!"
2,Don't bother if you've read any other leadership books.,"This book doesn't add anything to the mix of leadership advice. Not one of the 22 traits have I not seen before -- numerous times -- in other books. Her ""Lions Don't Need to Roar,"" is a much, much better and more practical book."
5,A Classic Brought Back To Life,"This IS the definitive edition of the Elfquest comics. The color is perfect, and this beautiful hardcover book contains many bonus images and interviews/bios with the creators of the comic. A must have for fans and a great way to introduce someone new to the world of Elfquest.I can't wait for volume 2!"
2,Disappointing,"I like Forstchen's books, but this isn't up to his usual standard. The plot adheres a little too closely to the events of the Midway campaign in WWII. Sadly, the Confederation has forgotten all the lessons learned in that period, and needs to be re-taught the hard way.I'd give this book a miss, and head straight for Freedom Flight. Then, you can go on to Forstchen's excellent End Run, Fleet Action, and Heart of the Tiger."
3,Not much like the games...,"The Wing Commander Action Stations couldn't have been written without the idea that history repeats itself, and I don't mind reading about Pearl Habor as long as it is covered up by the WC universe... However the technology seems to be way out of bounds using tech that is not supposed to be available before 2668 (WCII)... But afterall it is readable and enjoyable as long as you don't read between the lines!"
2,Took It Right Back!,"We just bought this toy for our five year old son. It looks really cool in the box, but was not any fun. It was too hard for him to put together by himself, and the pieces did not lock together very well. We've only been home for an hour and have put it back in the box to take it back. We will be exchanging it for another Power Ranger toy that's not so cumbersome."
5,As advertised. The Perfect size!,"I had a size-range in mind when ordering. To add more Prep area by the kitchen range, I have a typical 1 ft. counter & cabinet base with a drawer along one side of the cook range. I store this cutting glass along the sidewall of the lower cabinet. When I need the extra counter top for prep and cooking, I place the cutting board across the open side drawer and I have what I need. The pads on the cutting glass keep the glass from shifting off the open drawer. Dishwasher safe; it does not retain food odors and is easy to sanitize."
2,Do NOT be fooled......MADE IN CHINA!!!!,"Despite the name of the company that makes it appear as though you're getting something crafted in the US, it's NOT.....MADE IN CHINA.....and nowhere does it state that in the description. I AM VERY UNHAPPY because I try to buy as much as I can that's manufactured here. This may be a perfectly usable product but I hate being hoodwinked into thinking it's US made."
3,dimensions not exact,"sometimes someone needs the exact measurements so it is better to list it as the exact measurements not just 16 x 20 when it is really 19 3/8 x 13 3/8. now this may seem being picky but when space is at a premium, it makes a huge difference."
1,Avoid at all cost,"It's beautiful, but don't fall into it's trap. Glass cutting boards will absolutely destroy your knife's edge. Unless you sharpen your knifes on almost a daily basis, or use plastic knifes, avoid the glass cutting boards at all cost."
4,Good Glass Baord,"PRO- Resistant- Glass material avoid bad smells and is easier to clean.CONS- One of the rubbers of the table which give it support and stability, took off soon after use"
2,Good product except one of the corner pads was not attached properly.,"I would have rated it excellent, because it was what I had expected, however, two days after it arrived one of the pads came off. I believe that was a factory defect because I had only hand washed it and hadn't abused it in any way. It was to replace a similar product that I had had for several years and cleaned it in the dishwasher with no problems unitil I droped a heavy glass vase on it an it shattered, which was my fault."
1,NEVER CUT on Glass,"If you want to ruin the edge on your knives instantly use Glass, Granite or any hard surface. Always use Bamboo, Composite or Hardwood ONLY!!!!!My preference are boards made by Epicurean. These boards are best I have found."
2,"Its a HUGE board, but the noise it makes kills it.","We were looking for a large board, and this one certainly delivers on the size.However, it being glass, makes SO much noise when you are cutting and chopping as to almost make it unbearable to use. I will be using this as a surface, but no more cutting on it. Just too annoying."
3,Looks good,Other than one of the feet falling off when I took it out of the package this turned out to be decent.
3,"Good, but only for psych majors.","As my title says, this book is good, but only if you are a psych major. For any other field of study, this book will bore you to death!"
5,Love Survives All Dark and Cold,"I thought I might try to get through all of the Mary Soon Lee anthology WINTER SHADOWS AND OTHER TALES in one go, but really could not. Lee is a masterfully efficient storyteller, and packs great impact in a mere few pages. Her theme may frequently be the angst of the need and the search for true love, but there isn't much sentimentality here, and a very small margin for mere flattery and superficiality. For those who prefer that love be proven, genuine, and hard-earned, these are small but memorable gems, making strong use of easily accessible fantasy settings but always relevant to reality. It is tempting to wonder what Lee could do at greater length, but I personally have no idea how, or why, I would dilute such potent content."
1,Description contains no songlist,Even though there are several 5 star reviews for this title I wouldn't buy unless I could see a songlist or Table of Contents.
1,Impossible to rate,"I would love to consider this book, but without a Song Selection List, cannot. Before considering this purchase, a musician needs to see a short sample, even half a page, since the way a piece of music looks is so important."
2,Watch Out,"In researching this book, I read a review where someone said that it had a spiral binding (which is like the binding on my JUST JAZZ STANDARDS book). Well it does NOT have a spiral binding but rather a regular book binding. Thus it is very difficult to keep it open on the music stand of my piano (actually its impossible). I can't imagine what purpose the publisher had in mind (although someone somewhere might just want to read the book rather than play from it. On a positive note, the material contained in the book is well done, easy to read (if not easy to hold the book and play), and is the same quality that I found in the STANDARDS book noted above. Perhaps the publisher makes two versions and I got the wrong one. Hence the title ""Watch Out"""
1,No spiral or plastic comb binding,I don't understand why this C version is bound with either spiral or plastic comb like all of the other versions. This book simply cannot be used with a binding that allows the book to open flat on a music stand. I'll have to take this to Staples to rebind it.
4,Lives up to its title,"March is a fun writer. I bought ""Hard"" based solely on the fact that I enjoyed ""Looking for Trouble"" a whole lot. And ""Hard"" does not disappoint. It's not always quite as hot as ""Trouble"" but there are some fun stories."
3,Looking for Trouble was better,The first collection by March (Looking for Trouble) was great - hot varied action of post-teens. Hard is much shorter and the action is less varied. It's as if the author has lost touch with what turns on young guys. There are some good stories but often you feel unreleased at the end of most selections.
1,The stories are subpar...,"Hard: The Erotic Fiction Of R.J.MarchI have read much better stories, elsewhere, by the author.These stories are crude, outdated and very disappointing.He has written much better erotic fiction in other venues.Steven R. Marchio"
2,yet another crisis and perfect resolution,"This is another one of those extensions of TV that is stretched beyond the limits of what it can bear. The story - of discovery of an old colony vessel from Earth in civil war and danger of destruction by twin black holes - is OK for a single episode, but to make an entire novel out of it is excessive. It is a book that strains to have add believable filler details and additional characters, making for a rather boring read. The whole time I was reading this, I thought: so what, someone is making this up. Nothing unexpected happens, nothing is added that is new, and then the resolution solves all problems miraculously and with complete grace. Boring.The bantam editions of these books simply are not as good as the Pocket books. Not recommended."
5,"""They"" say it is the best and I agree!",My repairman said to only use this product and it has performed perfectly ever since.
4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Meskada is another direct-to-video feature I knew nothing about ahead of time. I choose it because the story sounded interesting and I love the cast. In these cases, the film is usually hit or miss, with no in-between. In the case of Meskada, it's definitely a hit! The story follows a local detective, investigating the death of a child, during a home invasion. What makes Meskada different from the rest is that 15 minutes into the film, you know who did it and why, it's not a mystery. Nick Stahl who I usually don't like and Jonathan Tucker who I've always liked are both fantastic in this film. It's roles that neither is really used to playing and both stepped up to the challenge. The story wasn't all that strong, but the acting was, and what I really liked about this film is how it came at a common story in an unconventional way. It's defiantly worth checking out!"
2,Could have done better...,"This mobile is okay, not anything extraordinary. I recently bought this phone and I'm not satisfied with it. Not many features to keep you in the know, though. it has great reception!(this phone has never dropped a call yet, but I spend most of my money on text messages, anyway) It is an excellent standard phone, but I think I won't be with this phone to long. If you care about how your phone looks spend your money elsewhere!"
1,Don't buy this phone,"I have had this phone since October and all it has done is cause me problems. It does not get good reception. The phone tends to overheat and die. I can never hold a conversation for more than fifteen minutes without it dying, and that is on a good day. The screen started acting up less than a month after I got it. It does not get good reception in buildings or around Eastern Washington. It worked well in Louisiana and Florida, but nowhere else. I can't wait to get rid of mine."
2,Nokia 6015i Phone (Verizon Wireless),"i want to know about Nokia 6015i Phone (Verizon Wireless).Ok, i will buy it."
3,buttons,"The buttons wear out easily so when you punch in a number on the keypad, it either does not work at all......or sends the number more than once. I sent mine from Verizon back in on a warranty, and the new phone does the same thing. Very frustrating!"
2,Not a god watch for the blind,"I purchased this watch for my dad to replace another talking watch that he had been using but had finally quit working. My father is 88 years old and cannot see very well. First the watch's clasp is very hard to use. My father is unable to either clasp it or remove it. Second, the watch's various buttons are extremely sensitive and the time/alarm set buttons are not recessed. In fact just brushing up against the watch and making accidental contact with a button will activate it. These results in the various functions of the watch being reset accidently. I had to reset the time after 2 days of use. The watch is a good looking watch but the functionality leaves a lot to be desired."
5,Best Strap I've ever owned.,"I have been using this Mss13 strap on all 4 of my guitars in assorted colors. It's comfy, looks great, & padded, some are 8 years-12 years old. They last & you can move it around when it's on, unlike sued that gets stuck on your shirt when you want to adjust the guitar. Just PERFECT!!!"
4,Cruel little poems,"This is a very short book - there aren't many poems. They are very cruel, almost disturbingly so unless you have the sort of sense of humor that embraces Edward Gorey's little alphabet recital (""B is for Basil, devoured by bears""). I do share that sense of humor and so found this book to be entertaining, and a suitable gift for some similarly-minded people on my gift list. It has b/w illustrations."
2,84-98 must be 84-96!,"I own a 1998 Jeep Cherokee (new model). Altough this book claims to cover this model and year, I didn't find anything about my car in the book. For me this book is of no vallue."
4,RE-build it yourself!,"Typical Chilton book, tells you everything about the car you could possibly want to know except the thing you're looking for. I recently bought an old (1988) Jeep Comanche; wanted to replace the speedometer cable...using this book I could replace the transmission, overhaul the engine, re-build the differential, but no where could I find any info on the speedometer. Line drawings are crude and difficult to interpret, photos are worse. The text is good and gives adequate instructions. When I go to grind the valves, I'll know how!"
2,Basics only,"Contains a lot of basic info, I found it to not be very useful. The wiring diagrams are very weak, they lack almost any thing but the wiring required to run the vehicle, no diagrams for the radio, or a lot of other little items which sometimes you need to know. This book also does not show you how to take apart a lot of your jeep, it sticks to the basics and that's it."
2,buy a factory service manual,"A serious do-it-yourselfer better buy a factory service manual for his/her specific vehicle from Chrysler. It costs $90, however, non-factory service manual is a waste of money for most of buyers. You just don't find information that you need to repair your vehicle."
1,Do not buy-you will regret.,This book covers way to many models.It lacks detail and diagrams are tiny and inaccurate.The index is terrible. There are topics covered that you do not find in the index. Be prepared to flip through the manual to find your topic-only to be disappointed by its content.Troubleshooting? Very little.This repair manual will frustrate you! Check out other manuals first. For the basics stick to your OEM manual
3,As advertised,This item was as advertised - slightly used - with greas smudges on the pages and the spien was cracked but all in all very functional and a great value for what I needed.
1,JUNK,"No information on how to check a neutral safty switch in the car.No information about how it is wired so I can figure it outNo information on dimmer switch hook upIncorrect or incomplet information on door locksNo information on tilt wheel problemsSave your money!!!!!!only reason for 1 star is they didn't have 0If needing info on how to change a light bulb, maybe - if you didn't have any trouble finding it because this is useless for that also."
2,Not exactly what Chilton says it is!,"This is a great manual for older Jeeps, but nothing matched my 1998 Grand Cherokee Limited. Funny that the picture on the cover is like my jeep, but all the info is about 1984 models. Not the sellers fault, arrived fast and in great condition."
2,Not great,It is better than nothing but it certainly does NOT give you all the info to properly work on car. It is only good for oil changes and maybe changing out spark plugs...that level of maintenance. I got the BISHKO manual on CD. It is way cheap and 100 times better. I would get that instead.
2,disappointed,I was very disappointed when I received this knife because in the picture it shows a nice stainless steal handle. The knife is sharp and still serves its purpose but it is a cheap black plastic handle on the knife. The knife is much lighter weight than the knife I was expecting. It was still a good value for what I got but I wish I would have gotten what the picture was advertising.
5,A must-have when visiting Kananaskis country!,"Not having visited the Kananaskis Valley since a child, I felt I needed some up-to-date information on the area. Ward Cameron's book on the subject fills the bill, describing subjects as history of the area, wildlife, backcountry camping, hiking, mountain-biking and cross-country skiing. He divides Kananaskis Country into areas which he then describes in full detail, with both text, full colour maps and stunning photographs, most of which he took himself.I enjoyed the book immensely and would recommend it to anyone who plans a visit to southern Alberta's Kananaskis Country."
4,How to keep your 3-year old busy for 30 mins,"This is a very educational but fun video for 3-7 year olds. I had some neighbors over for a barbeque and all of the kids watched the entire video without even getting up for chips or drinks! Since then, my 3 year old has watched it 3 times a week without fail. Because he has a video collection of 35 tapes (10 of which are firefighting) this is a HUGE compliment!"
2,Too noisy,"This product gives my Dodge Ram 1500 more power between 2K-3K rpms, and I seem to get better mileage by about 1 mpg. However, the noise under the hood is terrible. There is a lot of ""thunking"" going on when the filter draws in air. I am going to take this out and put the old unit back in. I would not recommend this product unless your truck is strictly a work truck. For everyday use, I just can't take the noise."
4,Psychology of Language (used),"Delivered on time, no problems. It was used, and the condition was listed as good, however the binding has broken a bit after a few weeks. Not sure if that is consistent with how it was described."
1,wrong product shipped twice,"This is classic Mose, but 2 attempts to buy this resulted in the same incorrect title being shipped (a live Mose CD in Montreux--still Mose but not classic Mose). I returned the first CD but gave up and kept the second although I doubt that I will listen to it again, one for the archives, I guess."
3,Hot Women But Boring,there are not many scenes at all the effects are horrible and way too much bad acting. but as usual the women are gorgeous its just no fun the plot is stupid but it is a cheap buy and if your looking for a good way to just b.s. some time buy this. the hot scenes are good and decent length i think some of the longest softcore scenes i've ever seen so that is worth part of it so it is a pick up but if your looking for a good film buy another but if your looking for cheap and fun but this.
2,To much chearleading and to little information,"After having read Norman Walker's series of books on raw foods and juices, I was looking for additional information. I was disappointed. While I share the author's enthusiasm for a raw food diet, I learned little from what he published. If this is your first book on raw food then your experience may be different. If you are looking for detailed scientific information and facts then you may want to look elsewhere."
1,dissapointing,"A poor follow up for an excellent first book, ""Insatiable"". This book, rather than focusing on it's main subject, continually adresses issues of sexuality more than anything else. True, most of the characters are affected by eating disorders, however the story deals with their relationships instead. If you're looking for a modern (but rather decorated) teenage thrill story, than this is a good read, but don't expect nearly the amount of immense information found in the first."
2,Item not as pictured,"The shirt that was delivered was not as it was pictured. The colors were completely different - the picture showed a faded red color with grey graphics on an SDSU long sleeve shirt and the shirt that arrived was red and yellow - like USC colors. I bought it for a school pride day at work, so I could not ask for an exchange in time. So now I'm stuck explaining why my SDSU shirt sports USC colors whenever I wear it. I will not be ordering from this store again."
2,So so,Too much preaching not enough concrete solutions to really be able to acheive the goal. I found it lacking in practical steps
3,disappointed,I have read many books on this subject. This is not the best. It was heavy on the bible and I wanted input that was not so Christian dominated.
2,Cherokee Plants,"This book does provide a good list of plants and their uses that would be helpful as a quick reference guide. If you are looking for detail on how to actually make medicine using these plants, then this book will not be very useful. Besides a few Native American myths, this book is mostly bland. It definitely isn't a very entertaining read."
4,"Broke one, oops.","I've been using these screw drivers at work for 8 months or so now. I am a motorcycle/scooter mechanic and I have put these things to work for sure. I managed to break the tip of the large flat head screw driver trying to bust a rusty screw once, I just put a new edge on it at the bench grinder and went on my way. I've also managed to twist the ends on the large and medium flat heads (before the large broke).They aren't bad, I actually really like them, though my next set will be better quality for sure.Also, if you work on greasy/dirty things (engines and whatnot), the 'soft grip' handles get super filthy, needing cleaning more often than most of my other tools. No big deal if you don't do dirty work, though."
3,"Nothing special, lousy case","I bought these screwdrivers a couple of years ago. They have held up reasonably, but there is absolutely nothing special about these drivers. There are little spots of rust on the tips but I live by the beach so everything rusts here. Why I'm leaving a review is for the carrying case. They came in a plastic bag with a slippery pouch for each driver. I threw it out immediately because using nothing was better than what they sent. It was difficult to close, the drivers fell out, etc. I would not buy these drivers again but can't give them one star because they function like a reasonable screwdriver should."
5,"great fit..pretty, girl design",I bought this item for my granddaughter for her birthday along with a Schwinn bike; she loves both!
1,I really wanted to like this...,"...and I'm sure I would. If the DVD would actually play properly.It's got great videos on it (I really bought it just so I could have ""On Building""), but so far I've only been able to get it to play properly on my Powerbook. No luck in my PC, or my PS2, or my XboX. Maybe I just got a bad disc, but since I can't return it now that I've opened it, I'm not buying another copy just to see.So, potential buyers beware, I may just be an isolated incident, but until somebody else writes a review you're taking a gamble when you order this disc."
4,Poor Packaging Damages Book,"There was no problem with the book, which I was familiar witih, but it arrived damaged because of poor packaging. One corner was bashed in and I was unable to give it as a gift."
2,"There are better books for ""economics 101""","You can find much better books regarding economics than this one. Try Milton Friedmans ""Capitalism and Freedom"" or ""Free to Choose"". Try Thomas Sowell's ""Basic Economics"" or Hayek's ""Road to Serfdom"" or Hazlitt's ""Economics in One Lesson"". All of these books are available on Amazon and give a much better, and more sound view of the world regarding Economics. Also there are lots of collections of columns from Walter Williams that are very easy reading and view life in this country through the eyes of economic principle. They are all much better than this book and use reason and logic to formulate their views. They also are all excellent in explaining their common sense views in terms that all can understand. You're money (and isn't that what economics is all about) is much better spent on these other authors than on this one and this book."
1,Pure sap,"1 year ago, I got back in to vinyl, and have collected 1500 albums since then. This album is, by far, the worst of them. Admittedly, I like the heavier fusion side of jazz/instrumental music. Lee had some impressive work in his earlier career, but by this point, he must have been living in an elevator. To me, this is the definitive album to show how good musicians sold out for some cash. The problem is, even if your tastes DO lean toward elevator snooze music, there are much better alternatives. If you want kitschy, cheesy schmaltz, you'd be better off mining the easy-listening fodder at your local thrift store's vinyl bin."
3,Trying To Be A Sharpshooter While Using A Shotgun!,"""Is It You,"" (From 1980's ""Rit"") was one of the most refreshing pop singles of 1980. Having spent a year in Rio de Janiero recording ""Rio"" Electra was chomping at the bit to have Lee cash in on his top 10 success. And so, ""Rit 2.""Two tracks , ""Keep It Alive,"" and ""Malibu,"" keep this release from being a less than 1-star recording! Lee Ritenour is a musical genius - he should NOT be wasting his time on drivel like ""Tied Up""! (To give you a sense of the song's credibility, Olivia Newton-John recorded it shortly therafter!) But ""Keep It Alive works, somehow. The combination of soaring melody and sad, fated lyrics has always always reminded me of the irony that laces most relationships. ""Malibu"" works on another level entirely: a haunting ballad that evokes a vision of the sea as the sun goes down somewhere - anywhere - that you'd like to be. Anyone with an interest in studying the history of pop-jazz fusion should listen to this recording!"
5,Great summer review workbook,My daughter is going into the third grade this school year. I ordered this workbook to help review over the summer the things she has learned in second grade. This is a great workbook with lots of pages to have fun while learning.
4,Second Grade Big Workbook,"I have used these books since preschool for my boys. I homeschool twins and these work great as suppliments to my curriculum. They are colorful, informative, and cover most things needed during the grade level."
2,"Depressingly, dismally uninspiring","Inspiration is catching, and apparently also the converse. Finding the words to adequately describe the depths of just how dismal and uninspiring is too great a task this moment. The photography is flat, the depicted works clumsy and crude, and the text shallow. From cover to cover, this book is a celebration of mediocrity. If I believed the level of skill depicted is the best I could attain in my lifetime, I would give up right this moment."
2,A collection of international carving examples,"There are a few helpful drawings and remarks - as can be gleaned from most text on the subject but overall I was somewhat disappointed. Primarily the book is a showcase of small touristy type carvings from the author's travels - chili, alaska, etc.There is a wide variety of such material covered but it's presented in more of example format - rather than how to carve.It reminds of some old library book from the 60's. Interesting, informative, but not very current or helpful."
4,"Pretty good ideas,",If your a dancer and like to cook then this is for you. Warning that some of the ingredients aren't easy to find. But basically the food is easy to prepare and very low in fat. Good purchase for those dance enthusiasts.
4,Let's be realistic for a moment,"Wonderful recipes, easy to prepare, yes. But most households won't have all the needed ingredients. I'm not talking about needing to buy some scallops. Some of the herbs and seasonings aren't common to keep, and some of the ingredients can be difficult to find, even in my area where Russian, Indian, and Chinese markets are as common as your run-of-the-mill grocery store. However, if you see cooking as an adventure and are willing to spend the time hunting down hard-to-find ingredients, go for it."
5,WOW,"A must read for anyone who is worn out from city living, the corporate life, etc. You can escape from it all in this book. This is the kind of book you'll want to sit by the fireplace and read on a raw Wisconsin night. Awesome book with great stories, essays and drawings."
2,Not worth the trouble,"After 20 or so pages, I was so turned off by these characters and the language, I never finished. A waste of time and a waste of money."
5,"Engaging, Rewarding reading!","RED WINE FOR BREAKFAST is engaging, rewarding reading from beginning to end. Robin Westmiller's abilities to weave a story so viscerally and visually auger well for her budding career as a novelist."
5,I loved it!,"Jenny Reed is a thirty-four year old New Yorker who hosts a morning radio show in California. Her career meant everything to her and she was angry to find out her boss, Brian, had hired his brother-in-law as her partner. Worse, her new partner, Johnny King, knew about the affair Jenny and Brian used to have. The tension shows even on radio waves and the station's rates soar!Things get tricky when drugs and murder cause a huge scandal at the station and the morning show, which is now called Red Wine for Breakfast, (and I refuse to tell why) is as shaky as the romance between the hosts.*** Perfect! A hilarious look at life in a radio station. Full of sneaky twists and I even learned why women should always make men take ""the sock test""! I have no doubt that Robin C. Westmiller will make many fans with this debut novel! *****"
5,.Those Magnificent Voices,Oh what rapture to hear two of the opera world's most beautiful voices once again.They are sorely missed.
5,Respect due to JSP,"For the front end of Java web applications JSP has never been given a lot of respect. It's always been the domain of lower paid 'front end programmers'. But that doesn't mean that it isn't difficult to do it right. This book takes the time to emphasize the patterns of implementation to make a solid web front end.The book covers the web application page flow of forwarding and maintaining state. It also covers tag libraries, data validation and a host of other topics.The text of the book is well written, and graphics are used effectively.This is a great book for front end developers. This is the type of coverage this complex topics needs. Hopefully we can get similar books for PHP and Perl web development."
1,A VERY WEAK ATTEMPT TO SPOOF THE OFFICIAL PREPPY HANDBOOK,".I bought this book used at a garage sale for a dollar, hoping to enjoy a witty spoof of the Official Preppy Handbook by Lisa Birnbach. What I got was a crude, uninteresting collection of meaningless attempts at wit by someone who should stick with lawnmower repair or computer programming. It should be possible to do a clever rebuttal to preppyness, but this isn't it. It doesn.t even come close.The best part of this book, if you can call it a book, is its cover, which is done somewhat in the style of the Official Preppy Handbook. As such, it makes a colorful companion to the OPH on the bookshelf, but don't pay more than a quarter for this extremely boring, unclever attempt at wit."
3,ear headphones,the only thing i love is the clarity of sound. I have other Altec Lansing products and they always have great sound. What I didn't like was it was always difficult to place clip aver ear. I use them to work out but feel like I have to rehang them continuously. May need to correct ear clips style.
1,You get what you pay for,"After reading a few favorable comments, I decided to purchase this item. Upon inspection, I noticed the Velcro straps were sewn onto a very flimsy nylon fabric. After the first use, one of the straps was torn at the seam. So much for a bargain. Don't get enticed by the cheap price. Buy something of better quality and you won't be wasting your time making a return request. At least Amazon was kind enough in this case to issue my refund without returning the item."
1,Fell apart before we could use them,"My son received these pads for Christmas, and by Dec. 29th one of the elbow pads is falling apart--he hasn't even used them, just tried them on a couple of times. The fabric has just shredded to pieces."
2,bad product,I thought this came as a set of elbow and knee pads. Only one set came as you can use it as either knee or elbow. The material is kind of cheap quality.
2,don't like this pad,The low quality jproduct. One knee pad was broken after one time use.Amazon sent me a replacement. but I found there are silimar products in local store with different brand name and better quality
3,Youth pad set,"This was a bit large for my grandchild, but that it not the fault of the product. It seemed to be OK. Hard to tell since he did not use them too much."
1,poor quality,"From the picture attached & the brand name, I expected to receive a high quality product.I purchased 2 pairs for my boys 7 & 9 years old. One of the knee holder tear out on the first usage due to a very poor seams.I am very disappointed."
4,An outstanding punk rock outing,"Outstanding punk rock from France(! ), this disc culls tunes from various sources and rocks throughout. In the tradition of the best punk outings, the tunes bristle with great hooks. Recommended!"
5,small for little hands,"I guess I didn't note the dimensions when I ordered this so I was a bit surprised when I first opened it and saw how small the slices are. BUT, that's probably better for little hands anyway and they are VERY cute, and soft. We haven't used them yet as they are a Xmas present but I'm sure my son will love making sandwiches with this bread in his new play kitchen!"
1,Wrong size,"Tailgate supports through Amazon.I had the exact same experience as Jeff.The same car, & wrong size by the same amount as his.I bet I read the reviews next time."
1,Trailer Song,"NOTICE...if you are looking for the song that plays during the trailer and the final scene of the movie (which is much better than the book's) then you want the Pixies' ""Surfer Rosa"" cd.It's titled ""Where Is My Mind?"" (which is more than appropriate for the movie)"
3,Dissapointing,"While the tracks on this CD work incredibly well in the film, by themselves without visual stimuli, I found them to be nowhere near as intense. Maybe this CD would be interesting to someone who's more into the Dust Brothers, but I thought it lacked intensity. To me, the only real reason to get it is the last track, which is also on the DVD as a video. Once again, with visuals, the track is MUCH better."
1,where the f**k are the pixies?,the ONLY reason i sought out this soundtrack was because I thought the pixies were going to be on it. what a let down. I can only hope that the song is at least in the movie.
2,Punked electronica,"Frankly, was quite disappointed with what they have put in the soundtrack. Of course, it IS OST but I would rather have there dialogues from the movie. Unless you're really suicidal, I wouldn't recommend it."
4,The Intro,People have been saying that the intro theme isn't on the soundtrack. Well it is. It's on track 10 about 1:00 minute through. Try listening to the album before commenting.
4,missing opening theme,Good techno stuff.I don't think anyone has mentioned the missing intro them (micro brain tour). I haven't been able to get any info on this.
4,So is there a special track or not?,"Is there a track with words in it... e.g. you are not special, you are not a snowflake.. some thing to that effect?Is it hidden?I loved the CD, and I bought Srufer Rosa, too, for the Pixies song... what about the version of Tyler Durden with words... anyone help this dumb guy out? :)ThanksPS - plese email me too"
4,Great Techno,"The soundtrack is great, but for anyone wanting the song that plays at the end of the movie, ""Where is My Mind?"", it is by the Pixies and can be found on their ""Surfer Rosa"" album. Which, by the way, is awesome. :)"
1,I am Jack's utter dissapointment.,"Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of Fight Club. And I think the Dust Brothers are excellent music producers. I'll even go so far as to say that their music fit the movie extremely well. However, the soundtrack is meant to complement the movie... and ONLY to complement the movie. On it's own it is bland, lifeless, and unmusical in every sense of the word. The only reason to buy this is if you want to re-live the movie... that's what DVDs are for, folks.Best to move along, save your money, and not bother with this one."
4,mental roadtrip,"after listening to this disk numerous times (it's one of those that grows on you... and grow it does - believe me) i have decided that the dust brothers are the real trip behind the bands we all know and love (ie. beastie boys, beck, etc...) i spend most of the day in front of the computer - it's how i make my living - i often get extremely absorbed in what i do - and this is one of the most appropriate discs to take with me on that daily roadtrip..."
3,Good! I thought there was more?,"This is a very good score for the movie Fight Club. It brings more energy to the already adrenaline rushed movie. I enjoy listening to it, but during the trailer I could have sworn I heard songs, that for some reason are not on the Fight Club Score. Maybe they well be on the motion picture soundtrack? Have to wait and see."
5,"A CD to play until you tag out or yell ""Stop!""","Six raves in a row here already, but a collection this outstanding just forces you to ignore extremes: From one of the best American films of the last decade, what else did you expect? These guys are the most agile sample masters since Loop Guru, with none of the pretense and twice the goofy wit. Uniformly and without exception one of your best buys of the year, the kind of timeless greatness that should make more annual Top Tens than the numbers 1 through 9."
4,Perfect Mood Music from one of the coolest movies ever,"I recently purchased the Fight Club soundtrack simply because I loved the movie and thought that the music in the movie was really interesting. Needless to say, this disc does not dissapoint, except for the Pixies' song ""Where is My Mind?"" which is omitted, this is a complete score of the movie. If you like dark, ambient techno and electronica (which I do) then you will simply love this album. However, this is definitely not an album to purchase if you're looking for something radio-friendly or if you haven't seen the movie. Fans of the movie will find it extremely enthralling. Its also perfect music for long drives. Best tracks: 1,2,4,8"
3,Not quite what I expected,"The reason I bought the soundtrack was because of the awesome opening theme from the movie.I did find what I was looking for in the second minute of track 10 (Stealing Fat); and 12 & 15 brought back a lot of the energy of the movie as well.But the rest of the tracks were low-intensity, unrememberable, techno-jumble. For some reason, I thought that all of the music in the movie really added to the emotion; maybe the soundtrack album has some differences from the movie?"
3,"Could have been great, but...","The Dust Brothers have come up with some great bits of music that very effectively capture the mood of the movie. However, this album couldn't have been made harder to enjoy if they had tried (or maybe they did?). While each track is of standard song length (4-6 min.), they are all cut up into completely unrelated parts. Nothing lasts more than 90 seconds, and even those brief 90 seconds contain lots of long, awkward pauses.Seems like all the DB did is create the minimum needed for the movie's requirements and never bothered turning any of them into actual songs. This is a pity because most parts of most of the tracks, esp. ""Marla"", would be absolutely fantastic if they were more fully developed."
2,Wish it had the Pixies song!,"The Dust Brothers produced a good mix of dark, moody music that fit the movie well, but the best song from the movie is conspicuously absent. The Pixies' song, ""Where is my Mind,"" was apparently good enough to make the trailer, the closing credits, and the tips of many moviegoers tongues, but it did not make the soundtrack, which is a shame..."
2,Where Is My Mind or Track?,"Like someone else has stated before me. Sounds like a kid on a mixer. Neat sound-effects inside some of the songs. Though most of the time as I would wait and think that a song would push the limit and be great, only to stop before that point happened and sound kinda toyish. Where is my mind? Or for that fact the pixies?"
4,Single Serving Friends Only,"I am a Single Serving Friend and I understand the concept of this score as it relates to the film. The alter ego of our hero and his warped trip through corporate america. If you are like me and live in countless hotels each week, then you will understand the beat, the tempo and the pulse of this score. Though the middle weakens, the opening and ending are great! Perfect score for the film..."
2,Boring,"I am a person who likes dance soundtracks very much, and Ihave always bought CDs on the base of their reviews. The previous Matrix soundtrack is my Idea of an excelent sountrack, rich in music styles, non-monotonic and simply amazing; most important: one does not have to watch the film to enjoy the sountrack. This soundtrack is simply boring. Frankly, I have not watched the film yet, and I am not amused by the way the appearence of tracks are; it seems that it is created based on the film clips. In every track, there is always a pause between beats which in my opinion is good, but when the whole CD features the same style of music - it kills the richness one expects from a soundrack. Try listening to one track - it reflects the whole album."
2,Great film music... but it doesn't stand up on its own,"Fight Club is without a doubt the greatest film I've ever seen. Yeah, I'm a fanboy. And what? And to make a great film flow, you need great music, right? Well, you need great music that fits the film, and the Dust Brother's score more than does the trick. The film is dark yet satirical, and it needed a score that would compliment that.However, the score simply doesn't stand up on its own. At times in the film it perfectly enhances the dark atmosphere, but its only a part of a tense scene. And hence, it sounds rather empty by itself.No matter how much you like the film or thought the music sounded good in it (as I did), I wouldn't recommend it. Like so many other scores, it could have been made into great music but fails since its just lifted from the film."
5,The Pixies,"Hey, everybody, go buy ""Surfer Rosa"" by the Pixies! In addition to ""Where Is My Mind"", it has a bunch of other killer Pixies classics, headlined by ""Gigantic"" and ""Broken Face"". This is their first and best album, and possibly the best alt-rock album ever recorded."
5,recycle your pets!,"this soundtrack is so good... everybody should drive listening this cd! 15 amazing tracks... mighty, but at the same time....smooth! makes any sense? well... i guess u have to hear the cd to understand me."
2,too many gaps for a solid score,"I'm a big fan of the movie, so much so that i consider it to be one of the few fine moments in modern american cinema. The Dust Brothers are great too, but without the images from the film, the compositions sound downright boring. The single track found at the end, ""this is your life"", is quality because it bears the doctrine of the antagonist. There should've been more voice-dubs added, because the film is rife with great quotes and quips. I was upset that both the Tom Waits track ""Goin' Out West"" from Lou's place and ""Where is my Mind?"" by the Pixies was excluded. They were what i would buy the album for, two of the greatest acts ever extablished."
2,"It is pretty good techno, but I expected to hear more on it.","The entire soundtrack consists of techno beats and a few shortlived melodies. It is a nice album to have, if you are into the techno genre of music.However, I bought the album expecting to hear the song I heard playing through the later part of the trailer, and was very dissappointed that it was left out. I think that there should have been more information available, with soundclips available for download, so buyers know more about what they are purchasing."
5,Fun,It has some disputable stuff in it. 50 great myths that you will find interesting and have you fighting with yourself on why you still agree with some of these myths.
1,Hi people,"Hi, my name is as Alana. Friends, Elise, Kate, Avery, Sophie and a few more I don't want to list!"
2,dry,"booring!!!! tedious , slow,, really by the time I read that my life will be over , I dont think it would be effective in any ones life"
4,Great Timing,"I would have given this book a Five Star rating but for the fact that the authors seemed to get a bit carried away with themselves toward the end of the book. But don't let that stop you. As us Boomers become more reflective and introspective with age and as we move from a life of having to a life of giving, believing and sharing, this book could not come at a better time. I guarantee you will see yourself and others you know in many of the examples shared in this book. The authors really do allow you to step outside your mind and examine how you really think about things. Best advice is not to read it as a text book, but read it to have some introspective fun with yourself. It really is a great read."
3,Just OK for me,"The basic concept of the book interested me enough to read it but the book DRAGS - repeating the same thing over and over.MY EXAMPLE - not part of the book: If a cow is green, that means it is not orange. The orange cow is not green. There is a cow that is green. There is a cow that is orange. HOLY COW!!! I GET IT!!!!!I also think it may turn people into Dr Spock Robots. Yes, I'd like to learn how to take in every nano angle, respect everyone's point of view and be honest BUT to discourage Intuition ? If I'm in a dangerous situation do I really need to make lists? Listening to my Intuition ""telling me"" there's danger could save my life.I already question most of what goes on in life so maybe this wasn't the book for me.IF you are a successful Critical Thinker - you will question some of this book. : )"
2,Eh,"I was on Safari at work looking for books to read and keep me busy. I came across this one, and read a few things here and there. Personally, I felt like the attitude in the book was somewhat prejudiced. It was like the authors put out their own opinions, and didn't care to know anyone elses. A lot of the things they said were true and quite enlightening, but others... not so much. I feel like the authors are somewhat closed-minded, and I find it kind of annoying. I feel like they were saying all religious people, and those who follow astrology are stupid (this pertains to the parts I have read so far). This isn't always the case. I am not religious, nor do I follow astrology... I just felt kind of taken aback with the attitude in the book. I guess it's just not for everyone."
2,I think I can't think critically enough,...to get through more than a couple of chapters of this. Take this review for what you will - I didn't finish the book. I might try and return to it later.
2,No so much,"This book didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. It may be okay for a young person, but not at my age."
5,GOOD BOOK,"This is a good book for those who are studing business, it is great for critical thinking and writing papers"
5,I wish I had read this sooner,This book forced me (in a good way) to re-evaluate my long time thinking processes. I am excited to think in new directions.
2,"Dated, Pendantic, and Laborious","Header says it all. This is billed as a workbook, but the work is not very deep or specific. I would definitely not pay for this."
5,"some difficult to read ,but it is a good book","some difficult to read ,but it is a good book,it worth to use some time to read,a abstract book ,i hope i can improve my english reading abillity"
3,REQUIRED BUT OUT-DATED; A HARSH ASSESSMENT OF A MAJOR WORK (LIKE JESPERSEN?),"The book was fascinating, and so much more sophisticated than what French ""femininist' sociolinguists are even beginning to come up with in 2012 (there are exceptions, yes.) I suppose I was discovering an entirely new domain of research (for Indo-European languages), and in that Lakoff is a i, with the ""anger"" if I may thus qualify her style, that by necessity accompanied the epoch. She has written mluch more, and if I say ""out-dated"", the term is the one would also apply to The Feminine Mystique: it was essential reading for my studies and I still refer to it in teaching."
5,Top of the heap in Flamenco Rock!,"Los Delinquentes is a really refreshing group of talented musicians without pretentions and clearly out to have the most fun before the day ( or the night ) is over. This CD includes luminaries such as Kiko Veneno,an innovator, who is perhaps the most outstanding pioneer in modern flamenco fusion(20 years + as an exponent of the genre) and Rafael Amador ( of Pata Negra fame, and the brother of Raimundo Amador) in addition to Diego Carrasco and Gualberto. The lyrics are a riot. Though they include a lot of jargon particular to modern Spain and the musician subculture. These guys are way hip, or as my son would say: ""sooo phat"" ! The content is fresh and daring, satyrical and totally relaxed. They rate right up there with ""Martires del compas"" They are that good and entertaining."
3,A book to read,"After taking a 12 weeks class on the material in the book, I found it had some interest and merit but not the type of material I would want to spend another 12 weeks on. First, if you read Jung you will have a up on the material in the book. It attempts to cross Jung and spirituality in a christian vent and in the end it is neither. Worth reading maybe but something that will alter your life, well that is up to you."
1,Doesn't Keep Correct Time,"The time on this clock is automatically refreshed daily. I have used the unit in Italy. The time continually alternates between European time and British time (one hour difference). Even if I manually set the time, the refresh feature cannot be disabled. I have experimented with different locations in the house, but I can't resolve the problem. I cannot trust this clock as an alarm clock (I did once, and while the clock was correct when I went to sleep, it had gotten out of kilter by morning). It's a great idea, but it doesn't work."
1,The worst clock ever made,"My wife bought me a radio controlled travel clock from Radio Shack about ten years ago. It is the same style as the Oregon Scientific travel alarm. Problem is that I can't find a replacement for it. All the websites (including Amazon) say it's discontinued. WARNING...the Fulcrum clock is similar but is a piece of junk. No back light (even though it says it has one) and the most complicated setting instructions I have ever seen. I sent it back immediately, not even worthy of one star."
1,Not enjoying my purchase,"These glasses are too big for comfortable use (bulky)Also, after being in dishwasher few times, the color came off. Now they look awful, so I am looking for new glasses right now."
2,A Selection form the Avesta,"This 50-page book is only a selection form the Zend-Avesta, and NOT the whole book. Still, it does give one a representative idea of what the rest of the book probably holds. May be intertesting for someone into Eastern Mythology, but who doesn't want to get in too deep."
3,Of course it's incomplete,"Only portions of this ancient text survived. This title should be considered in light of this fact. How can it be faulted for not including what doesn't exist? As for interpretations, the point of original sources is to be able to confront them directly, with out the interference of some other person imposing their thoughts. If you're looking for something that's already been digested, a critical work might be a better choice."
3,"Rough and Rugged Ball in Ball, Large","My dog loves this ball. He had one before, but the inner ball popped out. We thought maybe there was a crack in the ball. After the ball popped out the ball started to come apart. We bought a second one and within one week he popped the ball out again. We examined the ball and there were no cracks and we couldn't find out how he got the ball out. A couple of weeks later the ball began to crack and it is cracking at the hole the ball was in and in the paw symbols. I just orderded two more because he loves this ball. I wish it would last longer."
5,A Ball with a Bell!,"If you have a blind or going blind dog, this is the toy for him/her. Our dog, Zippy, a wonderful yellow lab, loves his ball. He knows its sound and its smell and takes it everywhere with him. The only time he leaves it is when he drops it in the lake and can't find it (even after dunking his head under and searching the bottom!)I heartily recommend it!"
3,This is not Kubb. But pretty anyway.,"This game is not Kubb, though it is the only thing that pops up when you search for Kubb. That said it's actually a very nice looking game set. Well contructed as far as I can tell. Don't know if I'm going to keep it or not cause I really wanted to get kubb."
3,What this book is about.,"This Book Is From The Forgotten Realms Box Set.This Book Is A Complete Guide To Campaigning In The Forgotten Realms, Including Two Introductory Mini-Adventures."
2,color problem,"The red and black colors of the quilt are good, but the plaid panels are navy, red, and white. The photograph shows a black, red, and white plaid. I am sending it back, because I don't like the navy in the plaid squares. The quality of the item is fine."
3,Carmen,"The recent 2011 version of Carlos Saura's Carmen (Blu-ray) is a poor substitute for the 1983 original film version. The original version is not currently available at a reasonable price. Netflix only owns a few of the originals and one of those was cracked and a replacement had to be resent to us. The 1983 film is available on YouTube [...] (not downloadable in the US), but the screen resolution is not as good as the DVD.This is a plea for someone to reissue the original 1983 film in which one can actually watch Antonio Gades, Paco de Lucia, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol in a fantastic performance we have watched a number of times while other Netflix users wait. We would love to own a DVD of this excellent film.The new stage performance is interesting but leaves one unlikely to watch it again. Carmen's relationship with her jailed husband before and after his release is very unclear in the new production. One is never sure who is fighting whom in several of the sequences."
4,"who needs you, ikea included tools!?","this baby is pretty nice, not sure how long it will last, there are some cheap-seeming plastic separators between each different size, but it's easy to grip and get some good torque on whatever you're screwing/unscrewing. plenty of sizes to choose from, i bought these as xmas gifts for a couple friends and myself and we've all gotten some good use out of them since then."
5,Monster Album!,"This recording by Bill Evan's is my favorite of all his albums or cd's. In no way is this smooth jazz. The music on this recording has a depth to it that is beyond words. Like all great music, especially jazz, it can transcend time and space. It is dependent on the listener. My favorite track is Dawn(in wisconsin north woods). Listen to the playing and sound that the bass player Mark Egan gets during this track. Evans sax has an amazing sound and his phrasing tells a story. If you think you are ready for a shift in consiousness, give this recording a try, you won't be sorry."
3,Static,"this mic is a good mic except for the problem i have had with it static in the back ground and cutting out when i transmit it has good volume an it can transmit for a long distance,the reason i brought it is because a friend that has one recomended it,unfortenly it was a defective one i'm still waiting for a response from the seller to see what they are going to do."
2,"Step Workout is Hideous, Weight Workout is Good","This video consists of two workouts: a step-aerobic workout, and a weight training (upper body) workout. DO NOT buy this for the step workout. It is really, really, REALLY bad. This woman has no business making a step-aerobic video. However, the upper body weight work is decent enough. The routine uses dumbbells - no gym equipment necessary. By the way, Lori Fetrick is a former American Gladiator."
5,Water crock for bottled water,"I purchased a water crock from For Your Water with the apples design on it. I love the design, which looks prettier than in the picture. I bought it basically to save rental money each month from the water bottler. It looks lovely in my kitchen."
4,i can relate to this story,"This book is about a twelve-year-old girl whose mom died when she was young. So now she lives with her dad and older brother, Lester. Alice wants earrings to fit in at middle school. So she gets her ears pierced and joins the earrings club. All the popular girls are in it, even one of her best friends, and her other best friend isn't, because she doesn't have earrings. Another problem in her life is a girl at the Melody Inn, where her dad works, likes Lester, but Lester does not like her. Then, Lester's old girlfriend, Crystal, likes him and she wants to get back together with him. Then, another of Lester's girlfriends likes him and wants to get back together. But, Lester likes Crystal. Then, Alice's dad had been going out with Miss Summers, Alice's teacher, and Alice wonders if they'll get married. Also Alice likes this boy who used to her friend, but he already has a girlfriend. I like this book because I can relate to most of her problems in life."
4,Well Written!,"When Alice McKinley, a mother-less girl, becomes a member or the ""in"" group, Alice gets a lot of attention from boys such as Brian. Then Alice learns that worrying about your looks and try on earings are not as much fun and even if she is in the Beautiful Eight, it is kind of boring. So after an embarrassment to one of Alice's true friends, Alice decides to do the right thing and even if it doesn't sound believible, it was touching and thoughtful! Mrs.Naylor is truly a well writer and has written over eighty books including Shiloh, which has one many respects and rewards. The Alice Series is well written and so is this Alice book. Watch for Alice's new book Simply Alice in Spring 2002. To keep yourself busy, read Alice's newest book around and the book that everybody's talking about with tears about Patrick being interested in another girl besides Alice in Alice Alone!"
3,Somewhat useful,"The CPL is useful and nice actually for such a cheapo model. The UV filter is NOT coated. Did not get a chance to try the neutral density filter.If you are on tight budget, then these may be good for experimenting. If you are going to use a $999 lens then I would suggest buy something better, just like other users suggest in filter reviews.I would recommend it for the CPL which is fun to use. I myself do use it with a $900 plus lens with good result. At very high zooms (300mm) the differaction lines will diffract the light and the image/view will be blur.I did find that there was no choice but to replace the UV filter with an actual multicoated Hoya $40 filter.Thank you."
1,new formula,I have been a loyal Cytomax user for 12 years now. Bring back the old formula. Stevia is just too bitter. I will not buy until it uses the old formula.
5,Great Product!,Great product. I have used it for cycling for years. Price was right and it arrived fresh with the expiration good for a very long time.
4,Cytomax,Excellent formulation for the lemon and lime product which mixes well with fruit juices. Far better than the other flavor they sell.
2,Wouldn't be my choice,"Definitely too sweet. Only purchased to get used to drinking during runs as an upcoming race is serving this on the course. I would recommend something ""cleaner"" with much less sugar to avoid gastric upset."
2,Go with Accelerade,...Just go with AcceleradeTests show that it WORKS and it's BETTER than cytomax...plus it tastes better
5,helps a lot during workouts,The mix helps a lot during workouts although this might be a subjective judgment. I definitely would order this mix when I finish this pack and consider other products by this company.
1,Did not know they had changed the formula,"The new formula is horrible. Gave me bad, BAD stomach issues the entire day after taking it. So I tried it again just to make sure. Yep, same thing. Stevia is NOT natural, and should not be marketed as such. If I wanted caffeine, I would have bought one of the 1000+ caffeinated supplements out there. Very disappointed in both the manufacturer and in the seller for not pointing out the change in formula."
1,New formula isn't nearly as good as the old,"A year ago I bought the Citrus flavor and it was quite good! But recently I bought the ""new formula"" doesn't dissolve nearly as well! (it clumps and sticks to the glass/water bottle) and its taste leaves much to be desired! I'm really disappointed in the new formula and I wouldn't recommend it!"
3,"Cytomax drink good, cranberry grapefruit flavor taste like medicine","Cytomax is a good recovery drink that doesn't have as much sugar as Gatorade. I like the fact that it reduces the lactic acid build up. I ran the San Francisco marathon and they gave out Cytomax. After the marathon, I was not as sore as I usually am the day after. I think it was due to the Cytomax. The bottled form is better than the powdered form. I don't like the cranberry grapefruit flavor. Try the tropical punch or the bottled form of orange or citris is better."
1,Great product gone bad,The old cytomax was my favorite endurance drink. Now it is vile and undrinkable. Cancelling my subscription with the hope that someday they will bring back the old formula.
2,New formula includes caffeine,"I bought 2 jugs of the 'new' Grape Cytomax. I read the ingredients information on the Amazon site, but when I went to use the product I now notice that it has a different formula and includes CAFFEINE. Some people like that. Others do not. Regardless, this should be clearly disclosed by Amazon. It is not. I can't comment on the taste as with caffeine I have dumped out the product - I don't want that for myself or my family."
3,tastes different than previous grape drink powder,I used to love this grape drink powder but not only the packaging has changed but the flavor is different as well and it does not taste as good as it previously did. I will not be re-ordering this flavor again.
1,New formula fails,"I started using Cytomax back around 2001, and it was the most amazing sports drink I had ever had. Taste, performance, ease of use; it had it all. I read the reviews here discussing a formula change, and went ahead and gave it a shot. I'm halfway through my newest container, and it's just not working. The taste is subtly off, and viscosity/texture of it is subtly off as well. Finally, and I have no way of explaining this at all, I think it actually gives me a light headache when I'm drinking it. Performance-wise, I think it generally still works, in that it provides some calories and hydration for longer workouts. But I don't like drinking it. All said, I will never buy it again. I will test outAccelerade Lemon Lime 60 servingsand hammer products, etc, and see which one is the best, and go with that. New formula fails."
1,Terrible new version of what was a good product,"It is always a huge disappointment when a product that you have relied on for years destroys its merits in search of a new image. Cytomax has ruined a good product with the ""remake"" it has imposed on its product line. It is now made with an artificial sweetener (Stevia) and has a quite different taste and different nutritional values. I will not buy this new version."
1,New Stevia sweetener is terrible,"The new Stevia sweetener ruined this, formerly my favorite drink by far. Cannot choke this new stuff down. I won't be buying it anymore until they change back to the old formula."
4,Good energy drink,"I like the performance of all of the cytomax drinks. This one has a weak flavor, which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Others may like this flavor better than I do. I like the grape and citrus best."
5,Cytomax - Go Grape,"Received the product very quick, delivered well packed, and the product was very good when received. I had not tasted Go Grape Cytomax, but I like grape flavored drinks, it's not a powerful taste so it isn't too sweet."
4,Good product but the taste could be better,"I really like the product overall. I keep buying it and trying a different flavor every time. The fruit punch took getting used to, the grape was decent and the pomegranate berry was ok. I think it's a good product either way. Just try different flavors until you find the one you like the best."
5,Great,By far the best price you can find anywhere believe me I looked. To do with the product; it tastes good and seems to enhance performance.
2,New Formula = bad taste,"I was hoping it would not taste as bad as other reviewers descriptions when I purchased it.However, other reviews are right.Cytomax changes the tangy orange formula; it doesn't taste good anymore"
5,Top 3 Favorite Supplements,"I have been taking sports supplements for a few years. And after trial and error I am down to 3 sports supplements to use on a daily basis with a paleolithic diet.1-Cytomax for endurance: electrolytes and carbs.2-N.O.Xplode for heart and vascular health, as well work-out intensity: N.O. aminos, creatine and caffeine/cns stimulant.3-ZMA for recovery: sleep aid and HgH.Link to Primal Blueprint (Paleolithic Diet) Mark Sisson.There is ONLY ONE correct diet. And this is it. Your nutrition/diet quest has ended. Enjoy. Be Healthy.The Primal Blueprint: Reprogram your genes for effortless weight loss, vibrant health, and boundless energy[...]"
5,Good product,"I feel that Cytomax has helped me during my training immensely. Should not be drunk by itself but in conjunction with water, and only for truly competitive athletes who feel the burn daily such as rowers."
3,Too sweet,As other reviewers have said the new formula is too sweet. I believe that when they changed to Stevia sweetener they added too much.
4,Cytomax,This is a great product. I particularly like the Tangy Orange but may try the other flavors later. I believe this drink reduces the chances of muscle cramps.
1,Please bring back old formula....,I will not purchase cytomax again until the old formula is brought back. The new stuff tastes terrible! Please bring back the old formula.
1,New formula - Yuk!,"Unbeknownst to me, the new formula was shipped to me. I used to love this stuff. It worked great and tasted palatable. I usually use less powder than what they recommend since I need a lot more water than other people. Now they've used stevia as the sweetening agent and the product is bitter and nasty tasting. It was so bad I thought the batch was off and was going to return it as defective! Then I saw the mention of stevia on the label. Oh...that explains it. That stuff doesn't taste sweet at all. It's worse than old school saccharin. Also they lowered the amount of calcium and changed other ingredients. It sounds like they reformulated to reduce costs. I can't use this rubbish. I want my money back and I'll have to try something else."
1,"New Formula, 2 thumbs down",I have been using go-grape for years. This new formula really sucks. Give me the old formula back. I will have to find a new flavor now.
5,Great service and great product!!,This is a great mix to put in your hydration pack for mountain biking. I never bike without it!!
5,Good Stuff- Good deal,"I find that cytomax works very well as a recovery drink after hard workouts. I live in florida, and in the summers it helps me recover quicker than gatorade. Also, the price is much cheaper than at the local health store.Good deal all around."
3,"Works good, tastes not so good","Like the product, dislike the tangy orange flavor. Like the cool citrus flavor quite a bit and it doesn't have the herbal lift. Some reviewers comment that it doesnt dissolve easy in cold water. Easy solution: Dissolves well in a little hot water, then dilute to the preferred strength. Used on a 100 km bike ride and finished with energy left over. Product works well."
3,Fresh Apple it Isn't,"The CytoSport energy drink is a helpful sports supplement. It does give a noticeable boost to help power through intense hour long cardio classes such as Spinning, Cardio Kickboxing and Zumba. There has been overall improvement in fitness, performance and an ability to increase workout frequency & time from using this supplement. It definitely helps in post workout recovery, little to no muscle soreness. Beats the muscle burn from Spinning and Kickboxing.I have previously used the Pomegranate flavored powder and it tastes more like 1980's Red Kool Aid punch than Pomegranate.The Fresh Apple flavored Cytomax is supposed to be a green apple flavor. Unfortunately, it tastes strongly of plastic with a hint of green apple. I would return it if I could.Also, if you use a sports bottle that holds 24 oz. count on using two scoops of the powder per bottle fill.The Cytomax works better if you drink a small amount 15 minutes before your workout, as directed."
5,Experience performance and recovery improvements.,"I used to drink this stuff when I had triple days (3 practice a day for 11 days straight) in college water polo. I didn't drink this the first year and despite eating enough and drinking lots of water, I was exhausted. The following year I drank the Cytomax just as directed I noticed my recovery was much improved as way my overall performance. I don't compete at the same level anymore, but I still notice the benefits in my daily workouts. The taste is great as well when mixed correctly. Even if it's a little watered down, it still tastes better than water alone."
2,"Great Seller, Shipping & Price. Don't like Cytomax","I used Cytomax for about a month and didn't like it. It gets great reviews from the majority of people that use it & I beleive most of them are cyclists & long-distance runners. I play hockey, do interval sprinting, & weight training so I thought it would be good for me. I guess it was okay, but I find for my type of training that Gatorade G-2 PRO Series works better. I do NOT use the pre-workout or the post-workout G-2 PRO Series, I use just the ""Perform"" which is for during the workouts. I have other supplements that I use for pre & post workout. The Seller, Shipping & Price Get 5 STARS *****. The product, for me particularly & my experience gets 2 Stars."
4,Love this stuff!,Best flavor IMHO. Great for centuries and other long rides. I keep a couple in my jersey for long rides.
5,Bike and Swim Relief,Cytomax keeps me at peak performance longer. I use it on rides. My daughter uses it at swim practice. Easy to use. Great taste. Stores well.
4,Good Cheap Lotion,Brown Envy Dark tannning lotion is wonderful. It does everything the bottle says it will. The color is medium to dark and it smells so good before and after tanning. Great low price for the color you will get.
4,Fit my 2000 buick century perfect!,"This magnaflow direct fit cat fit my 2000 buick century perfectly! Gasket is included which is not as I bought a different cat for a land rover and it was not. Shipped quickly and only thing I don't like is there is a slight undertone that some call a hiss when really accelerating from it. Also the picture is not exact. There is what looks like braided flex tubing integrated in the bend near where it meets the exhaust manifold at the top to allow to bend. Not a problem, but just know the picture is not exact."
3,Nice picher lousy set,This is beautiful china but it has a problem with Crazing. Which are little cracks in the china. This piece is probably fine but the rest aren't. So pick another set unless you're just buying the pitcher.
3,Aran Sweaters part 2,"This is the second volume of crocheted Aran sweaters. The first offered a variety of patterns and styles that tempt crocheters of most skill levels to try an Aran sweater. This volume has more of a ""traditional Aran"" feel to it and seems to be for the more skilled crocheter, with the emphasis on cables and twists. The instructions are clear. Experienced crocheters looking for a traditional Aran look will find much to make in this book. Less experienced crocheters will be happier with the first volume."
2,stitch instructions unclear,I found some of the directions to be unclear. I was able to get better instructions on some of the stitches by searching the internet. I was disappointed in this.
3,More Crocheted Aran Sweaters (Paperback) by Jane Snedden Peever,"These sweaters turn out to be very heavy. I made two..the cover cardigan for myself and a pullover for my daughter in law. They also turn out really big even when on gauge. I ended up taking off the button and button hole edges and using a zipper so there it was smaller around and wearable. It is OK for very cold climates, but I don't live in one of them. My daughter in law likes the pull over for outside use, not inside...she lives in a cold climate. I think I will knit aran in the future. I have made crocheted afghans and they are lovely though."
3,What a shame to the series,"I am an Emily fan and was excited for the new book. After I read it, it was too short, not detailed enough and made it seem like at the end this prince gets all the credit! He is OK and all but I'm a little upset that he is part of the gang now since Emily and him like each other. He didn't really do much mostly Emily and with the help of the other mages stopped the Sorceress from her evil plans.Well it was a good book and I thought it was OK. It had alot of adventure thats for sure so it made it up and I couldn't put the book down! It was OK but the beggining may be a little boring but the ending makes it all up."
1,I wish I could give zero stars.,"If you ignore the fact that Philippa Gregory's writing style is dull and that she overuses italicized thought paragraphs to show what the main character is thinking, which is so very annoying... and this can all be overlooked if the tale is exciting... and this tale is not..... you're still left with half a story. The book ends before Henry even begins his infamous casanova-ist adventures. I can't say all of the references to Isabella of Spain were necessary. If I wanted to read about Isabella, I would have bought a book about her."
3,A Disappointment,"I'm a big fan of Philippa Gregory's novels, but it seems she's writing them too quickly. This one's subject -- Katherine of Aragon's girlhood and marriages to Prince Arthur and Henry VIII -- is potentially fascinating, as is the underestimated Katherine, or Catalina as she is known here. And without spoiling the novel's secret, it is bold of Gregory to make certain assumptions about Katherine's marriages. However, none of the characters is as well developed as in her better novels, such as Earthly Joys and Virgin Earth. The historical events are also presented superficially, with no real sense of the complexity of court intrigue at this time. Henry VII is sketched as a mere dirty old man lusting after his son's fiancee, and Henry as a spoiled adolescent. This novel also lacks the subtle supernatural touches that enliven Wise Woman, the Wideacre trilogy, and The Queen's Fool."
3,I'd like to give 3 1/2 Stars...,"But they don't allow it! Having to chose between 3 or 4, I sadly have to opt for a 3 star rating. The novel was enjoyable to read, but definitely not one of the author's best. I previously read ""The Other Bolyne Girl"" (which was wonderful by the way) and found it strange how totally different Katherine is portrayed in each book. She seemed too simple in this novel. I have to agree with other reviewers' opinions that this book seemed rushed. One last annoyance: I also at time felt lectured to about Islam."
2,BORING!,After reading the other Boleyn girl I was hooked! The second book to come up was the constant princess. And what a boring book! It was really easy to put down and it felt like P.Gregory didn't know much about Katherine at all (not suprising how long ago she lived but still) and it felt like it was all about war. I had high hopes for this book... I would not read this book if I weren't to read the Tudor books.
4,"Good storyline, very wordy descriptions","Now that she's popular, Philippa Gregory is on a fast track to publishing her historically accurate novels. This one, although not as good as The Other Boleyn Girl, keeps the reader somewhat interested. The 400 pages could have easily been cut down but for the repetitiveness of Queen Catherine's destiny, her undying love for Arthur, her destiny and oh! by the way, her destiny. We get it! Also, the ending seemed to be too quickly wrapped up and over. It seemed like Gregory had a quota to fulfill of 400 pps. and done. Anyway, it is still a good read -- full of love, war, backstabbing and all the characteristics that made the English court so intriguing. If you like romanticism mixed with English history, you'll enjoy The Constant Princess."
1,Boring and Inaccurate,"I wish people would stop referring to Gregory's novels as ""Historical Fiction"" and relegate her to where she belongs - ""romance"". Gregory pointedly ignores and distorts historical fact in order to write extraordinarily boring fiction ""based"" on real people.The true lives of the Tudors were scandalous, entertaining, and fascinating. It's amazing how Gregory can manipulate them in an attempt to make them more interesting only to make them completely tedious.The Constant Princess is a poorly written Harlequin romance novel populated by people bearing the same names as historical characters."
3,not my cup of tea,I'm not sure if I didn't like the writing or just that I didn't like Katherine. I usually like Phillipa Gregory novels. I do like The Other Queen and found Mary Stuart very compelling. I also like the Boleyn Inheritance as well as The Other Boleyn Girl.
3,Not as good as the others,"I am a huge fan of Phillippa Gregory, and this was probably one of the most disappointing of her books. The beginning of the book does a good job of providing insight into the life of Katharine of Aragon while she was still the daughter of Philip and Isabella, but it fails to portray her as the strong woman that she was. She was the most defiant of Henry's wives, and was truly set aside on a whim. Overall, it wasn't dull, but certainly not as engaging as Gregory's other books."
3,So much more to Katherine's life...,"Though the story of the supposed lie Katherine of Aragon told was intriguing, I find the more interesting part of her life the part while her husband casts her away for another woman and she loses everything. The last part of the book seemed to drag on without too much excitement--mostly war strategies that I suppose might interest some people but I found dull. If Gregory had incorporated both Katherine's marriage with Arthur--which was told perfectly--and her demise to Anne Boleyn, this book would be even more amazing."
4,Would recommend this book,A wonderful and interesting version of the early life of Catherine of Aragon.I would recommended this to anyone that enjoys Tudor fiction.
2,Dragged on and on!,"I have read several of Philippa's other books, and enjoyed them quite a lot. This one happens to be about my favorite Tudor Queen, so I was very excited to read it. It ended up being a big disappointment! I'm not about to talk about the parts of history that were inaccurate, I don't read Gregory's books for accuracy, they are fiction and I feel that gives her a little bit of room to rewrite history. However, there simply wasn't enough going on! We get it, she waited, years and years she waited, it felt like that's what were were waiting as readers! I'm still a Gregory fan, of course, but this is not her best work. I wish Gregory had focused less on the waiting in a little castle, and talked more about her as Queen, because she was so great."
1,Remarkably Shallow and Inaccurate,"What a bizarre book! I have read many fictional biographies of the Tudor era and this is one of the very worst. Not only are the characters very shallow and one-dimensional, the entire premise is historically inaccurate.Katharine of Aragon was a very pious, deeply devout Roman Catholic and to suggest that she embraced Moslem customs and beliefs is just too bizarre to believe. She was also deeply devoted to Henry VIII and to suggest otherwise goes against documented historical record.As if the sappy storyline (suitable for a romance novel)wasn't insult enough, Ms. Gregory's disregard for truth is the one constant thread in the whole entire novel.To cap it off, the disjointed narrative method adds its own cachet of awfullness. I personally don't need to read every few pages that Katharine believed herself born and designated by God to be Queen of England.Nora Lofts has written a far better book about her-the Kings Pleasure. Do yourself a favor and read it"
2,A Disappointment,I have enjoyed almost all her other works but this one was a waste of money and time. I couldn't force myself to get to the end. Continually I turned the page in hopes it would get better but it didn't. The way she moves the point of view from Katharine back to the story is not enjoyable. I would hate not to enjoy Philippa Gregory again but this one will make me think twice before paying full price again.
3,The constant Princess,It was a good book a bit drawn out in places . I enjoyed it as a light read. I most likely would not go for another of this authors books.
5,"""Tell me a story...""",I really enjoyed this book. Philippa Gregory did an excellent job writing this work of fiction. I love how she makes you feel like you are in the 1500's with these timeless characters. Well done.
3,Not as good...but okay.,"Fat Assassins (The Fat Adventure Series)I became a Phillipa Gregory fan after reading The Other Boleyn Girl. I expected more of the same with this book, but it wasn't as good. Normally, Phillipa can capture the mood of court with complex politics while revealing interesting intrigues to the reader - pulling them into the moment. There wasn't any depth to the characters or settings almost like it had been written too quickly from an outline.The story line had potential, but I didn't feel transported like previous books."
2,Very Disappointing,"I was coming off the page-turning ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and the satisfying ""Boleyn Inheritance"" when I picked up ""The Constant Princess."" I told myself after the first 20 pages that I should give it a little bit more time to pick up because all of her other books had. However, I found myself...bored with the characters, the story. It was not engaging."
2,"Forced relationships, lack of history","This book was recommended thsi book to me as being a good historical fiction. The problem is how SLOW the book is! I can't let me children read it because of the sex, but even as an adult, I can't call this book a necessary read. The first quarter of the book are notes the heroine writes to herself and stories she tells her prince. It came across as very forced... nothing natural about their interaction.I can't say I'll check out any of her other books..."
5,Very good reading,"Haaving read the Boleyn series of books, I enjoyed each and every one of them. I love the history involved."
4,The Constant Princess,"I had not read anything by this author, so really didnt know what to expect - however, I am now ADDICTED. I thought the story was well written and enjoyable. When reading this type of book, you have to remember that it IS historical FICTION. The author did do some really great research, but people, this is a novel... that being said - I thought it was very good & would recommend it. I am currently on my 3rd book by this author ..."
4,Addictive,This was my first Phillipa Gregory book and I have become addicted. I have read them all and keep recommending them to others. I have always been fascianted by Henry Vlll so of course this series pleases me. I did refer to historical material and happily discovered that so much is accurate.
2,Annoyingly written and repetitive,"I'm halfway through this book and I'm not thrilled with it, but it's entertaining enough to finish, despite the fact that the characters are wooden and one-dimensional, and the writing is boring. As others have said, Gregory often repeats certain points to death. Every other page, it seems, Catalina is reminding herself and everyone else that she is the Infanta of Spain/Princess of Wales/Queen to be/daughter of Isabella and that everything is God's will. I find myself skimming a lot of these passages because they're so repetetive and don't further the story at all. The author also has an annoying habit of using ""D'you"" in her dialog, which doesn't fit with the formal style of the rest of her writing, and using ""especial"" instead of special. She doesn't use any other ""Spanish-isms"", so her use of ""especial"" seems gratuitous.I bought ""The Other Boelyn Girl"" at the same time, and I hope that it's better than this book."
4,Unusual perspective on Katherine of Aragon,"I, perhaps like most, had very little knowledge of Katherine of Aragon, or Catalina, as Gregory refers to her, beyond her being Henry VIII's first wife. Yes, I knew she had married his older brother, and after his death, had been subject to humilation and ill treatment by her father-in-law, but little more. I found this work of Grergory's to really dig into her personality and the events as they may have unfolded. I enjoyed the style of the work very much, as it passed between third person and the musings of Catalina herself in the first person. I have read many of Gregory's other works, and enjoyed The Constant Princess just as much.I loved the ending!! Not quite where I expected the book to stop, but it made perfect sense!"
3,Not what I hoped for,"I am a huge fan of Philippa Gregory's novels. I've read the ""Other Boelyn Girl"" three times and ""The Virign's Lover"" twice. I was disapointed however with this latest novel. It wasn't what I was hoping for. While I was interested to learn of the past and hardships of Catalina of Spain, I wanted more of the Anne Boelyn story from her perspective. Instead the novel talks of her childhood and the early years of both marriages, and the glosses over being put aside by her husband."
3,Disappointing after The Other Boleyn Girl,"My first Gregory book, The Other Boleyn Girl, blew me away. Even before I finished reading it I was ordering her other books. When I finished The Other Boleyn Girl I jumped right into The Constant Princess. What a disappointment. The ""voice over"" style is cheesy and unwelcomed. It seems like an unimaginative method of communicating Katharine's thoughts. You could make the argument that it was appropriate given Katharine's circumstances of being in a strange land and not being able to trust anyone around her but it simply does not fit. I found myself loathing the italicized passages, often skipping through to pick up a few words for each line just to make sure I didn't miss anything but not wanting to waste my time on them.I don't recommend this. In this case, the non-fiction was a more exciting read than this."
2,Constantly dull.,"I've been reading about the Tudors for many many years but this is the first book I read about Katherine. I was always interested in her and felt pity for her because of the whole Boleyn affair. But I found it hard to stay interested in this book. Not that Katherine isn't a fascinating person, it's just that there is nothing that really leaps off the pages of this book. It almost felt like Gregory got bored with the book herself and decided instead of researching and writing more about Katherine's reign, to leap ahead about 20 years to the trial at Blackfriars just to get it done. But perhaps the biggest annoyance to me was the switch to Katherine's thoughts by using italics. Reading pages and pages of italicized text is not so easy on the eyes and I found myself skipping those parts a lot."
2,Not Her Best Work,"I loved The Other Boleyn Girl and The Queen's Fool, but this novel is not up the standards Philippa Gregory set in those two books. It started out strong, but became repetitive and boring, with little for the title character to do but pace around various castles and prisons reciting internal monologs about why she ""must be queen!"" For readers who enjoy historical fiction written about this era, I strongly recommend Margaret George's Autobiography of Henry VIII or Mary Queen of Scotland and the Isles, both truly brilliant historical novels."
2,Unsatisfactory,"I've been a big fan of Philippa Gregory and I'd looked forward to reading her new novel. But I have to say this is a total disappointment.1) Unsatisfactory ending: The story ended when it got interesting. (When Anne began to threaten her status.) Where's the beef? How can you talk about Katherine's life without her divorce or the painful process leading to the divorce?2) Weak and contradictory charactor development. Her description of Katherine's personality/charactor in this novel and that in Other Bolyne Girl do not really match. I didn't feel the Queen in ""Constant..."" and the Queen in ""The Other..."" are the same person. Katherine in ""The Other"" was totally in love with Henry but Katherine in ""Constant"" was a very calculative woman who married him b/c of his status.3) Lack of continuity: Except for Henry, Katherine and other minor charactors, no major charactors in ""The Other..."" appeared in ""Constant.""I hope her next novel will be much better than this. It's got to be."
4,"Catalina, Princess of Spain and her place in English history","The author has a unique ability to make historical figures come alive. Rather than studying their biography in the classroom; a reader gets to know the person. The Constant Princess is Katherine of Aragon. Princess Catalina, the youngest child of Spain's Isabella and Ferdinand, has been destined since birth to be the Queen of England. Catalina becomes known as Katherine when she arrives in England. A 15 year old Katherine promises her husband Arthur, Prince of Wales, on his deathbed that she will renounce their marriage and marry his younger brother Henry, who will become King Henry XIII. This novel does seem to be lacking the same pizzazz as the author's two most recent novels; as though it was hurriedly written. It moves awkwardly at times from Katherine's writing and thoughts to the third person narrative. Overall it is successful in describing what life was like for a young noble woman in early 16th century England."
3,Not Gregory's Best Effort,"The story is good, but the book really drags on and on. Could be half the length and tell the story well."
4,The Tudors,"Read in June, 2012formatPaperback (edit)reviewThe Constant Princess by Philippa GreggoryThe historical novel based on Katherine of Aragon was a great read. The thought of being born a royal princess was nothing like being groomed or brainwashed into thinking that your inferior and nothing but a pawn to gain lands for your family. How sad that these women were brought up this way. Most made the best of their situations and have come to love their betrothed others just produced an heir and were content with that.The Author brought Katherines story alive as she was betrothed to Auther, Prince of Wales. Her love for this man and her loss of her dear husband to sickness, as his dying wish he wanted her to marry his brother Henry so that she may be Queen of England.She did become Queen of England, ruled as a regent when Henry was away, bore children that were stillborn and those that hadn't live long. However she did bore Henry a daughter, Mary. Later on in life Mary was the Queen Of England"
5,Awesome,Once I started on this book I could hardly put it down. Wonderfully written. Phillippa Gregory is becoming my favorite author.
2,Horribly disappointed,"I give it 2 stars for effort, but it was quite frustrating to read this book. I really had high hopes for it. I've read ""Earthly Joys"" and ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", both of which I found enjoyable, despite the comma splice errors et. al. This story, however, was told with such cumbersome and repetitive diction that I put it down after the first 1/5 and gnashed my teeth in exasperation.Apart from the annoying stylistic faux pas, the character and plot development proved woefully improbable and wholly unsatisfactory. Catalina is very rarely amiable, and for the most part she comes across as arrogant, religiously fanatical, stubborn and somewhat asinine. Every time she mentions her mother I just want to slap her.I painfully finished the book after a 2-week hiatus, hoping that a fresh perspective might help, but unfortunately the story just grew more and more tiresome. I hardly even know how I managed to endure it."
5,The Constant Princes,"Well written. A very interesting way to learn the history of England and it's monarchy and still enjoy the experience. I am now reading the fourth book written about the royal families by Philippa Gregory and find them all very interesting. Each book stands on its own, yet if read in order, there is a sense of a continuaous historical information."
3,Being royalty does have a down side,"Philippa Gregory tells a beautiful story about a tantalizing period in history. At age 3,Catalina, Infanta of Spain and dauthter of Ferdinand of Aragon, is bethothed to Arthur, son of King Henry of England. She leaves Granada and the warmth of her families Moorish palace at age 15 and travels to cold, damp, dark England to wed. Arthur dies of a fever soon after the marriage and Catalina marries his brother Henry, Prince of Wales. Upon Henry's ascention to the throne he is crowned Henry VIII and Catalina becomes Catherine, Queen of England. It's then that her troubles really begin.Little is actually known about Catherine of Aragon, but Ms. Gregory has demonstrated the fine art of taking the few facts available and embellishing them to weave an interesting historical novel featuring a central character you can't help but empathize with. (Rating 3 1/2 stars.)"
1,What happened ?,"I felt like I was reading a political novel, instead of historical fiction. I read to get away from the Christian vs Islam Bs we hear on the news everyday. The author shoved it down my throat. I have read every novel Ms. Gregory has ever written. This is the worst she has ever written, and the last I will read."
2,Not my favorite but learned a lot,I was expecting a lot more from this book. I found it actually kind of boring at times. I love Philippa Gregory but I wasn't impressed by this one. I think Katherine was a great and admirable woman and I hate how her life ended but nothing too much happened in this book. Here's a summary: Katherine came from a powerful kingdom whose parents were great warriors. She married King Henry VIII's brother out of love but he died and married King Henry VIII who was much younger than her and who did have a boy's puppy love for her. They reined side by side for the first few years of their marriage and Henry trusted and honored Katherine. Until he began to come into manhood and became paranoid and had a wondering eye. From there it tells how Henry falls out of love with Katherine and in love with Anne Boleyn and how he tries to denounce their marriage and cast her out which she eventually dies of emotional and physcial neglect. That sums it up.
5,One of Gregory's best works,"While we are typically treated to a view of Katherine of Aragon (Catalina) as a stern, solemn religious woman who is being obstinate about the demise of her marriage, The Constant Princess gives a plausible account, not only of her early childhood, but of her rationale for marrying Henry VIII, and the mission, based on a deathbed promise to Arthur, Prince of Wales. Once again, Philippa Gregory enthralled me with a tale of the times which, having now read many of her books, as well as many of the references in her bibliography, seems like she was a reporter on the scene. Well done, Ms. Gregory!!!"
3,"Okay, not one of her better novels","This is typical Phillipa Gregory historic fiction. Katherine's marriage and intimate relations with her first husband, Arthur, is well written and Gregory's version of events surrounding this time in her life are believable, although her lifelong obsession with carrying out Arthur's wishes of another Camelot were over-dramatic and over-written.This novel does include Gregory's trademark descriptions around events, clothing, and locations, all of which are captivating and intricantly detailed. You quickly become attached to Katherine's character. You will experience the victory of her long-awaited coronation as England's Queen, as well as the desperation of her last days in exile.If you enjoy Gregory's other works, and have a moderate interest in Henry's first wife, then this book should be an enjoyable read for you."
2,A constant drag of disappointment.,"I loved reading Gregory's books- The Other Boleyn Girl and The Boleyn Inheritance- so I thought for sure The Constant Princess would be a great read. Boy, was I disappointed. I thought the author hurried through this one and that maybe she didn't research well enough. It read like a predictable romance in the beginning, which I found repetitive and sticky sweet, almost boring. Then it just got worse. I didn't really connect with Katherine as I had wanted and I really didn't understand why the author shifted from first person to third person. That really bothered me.I must say that I am glad I started with Phillipa Gregory's other novels before I began this one, otherwise I don't think I would have read anything else by her.My quest to gain knowledge of Katherine of Aragon must continue and I hope to find what I'm looking for in Jean Plaidy- an expert in historical fiction about the queens of England."
4,Loved this book,I really enjoyed reading this book. Who knows what the real truth is about Catherine. The story presented here is very well done and believable.Well done.
3,The Constant Princess,This book would be more enjoyable if you don't know you English history as a large percentage is fiction
2,Very Disappointed,I've enjoyed quite a few of Philippa Gregory's other novels which is why I read this one. I was so bored by it. I can't remember when it took me so long to finish reading a novel as this one did.
3,More! What about Katherine's Fall from Grace?,"The book was OK. It isn't my favorite of Gregory's Tudor books. I really would have liked learning about what happenened to Katherine AFTER the rise Anne Boleyn and her fall from grace. The book could have been much longer or lots of stuff could have been condensed to make room for that part of the story. How did she live? What regrets did she have? How did she make peace with the sitation or did she? She thought she was destined to be Queen of England so how did she live out the rest of her life? That said, I still think Gregory is a good writer and I'm glad I have read all her books. . ."
3,Just OK,"I am a fan of historical fiction and I usually like Ms. Gregory's work. However, this book just would not end. It was, in my opinion, long and drawn out. Nonetheless, the storyline was good and it kept my interest. I just wish it had a bit less 'fillers'."
2,Two and a Half Stars Please,"While ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" was richly imagined in great detail, most of this book was repetitive and generalized. It did give me the barest background on Kathryn, for which I was grateful, but I expected mastery and got averageness."
3,Enjoyable story; didn't like the typographical issues in Kindle edition,"As usual, I enjoyed this historical novel from Phillipa Gregory. The one thing that bothered me and caused me to downgrade my rating by one star was the numerous typographical issues in the Kindle edition: spaces where there shouldn't be, no spaces where there should be, etc. I would expect the same quality out of a Kindle edition that I would from a print edition and it was a little lacking here."
2,Some worth but too romance novelish,"This historical element of this novel is interesting, but its main downfall is that is is simply too far into the more seedy romance novel category. The love scenes are too graphic for my taste. And I think it takes away from the main story. I would like to see Katherine of Aragon's story written again with more emphasis on the political element rather than the wedding and bedding element."
4,Good Historical Fiction Read,"If you loved The Tudors then you need to read this series. I loved seeing the story play out from her point of view. Very well written, can't wait to read the next book."
2,Not based on history...,"I didn't enjoy this book. Mostly because the events in the story don't match the true historical events. Plus, I thought the pace was slow and boring and I didn't care for Katherine's anecdotes in the story."
2,it's just okay...,"The Other Boleyn Girl was amazing, however I found myself skipping through this book repeatedly. I was bored....not near the caliber of OBG."
5,Another Fascinating Book by my Favorite Author,A very interesting book about the first half of Katherine of Aragon's life. The author follows the life of the first wife of Henry the 8th from her childhood through her first few years of marriage to Henry. I thoroughly enjoy Gregory's books both for the history and the great story telling.
3,Slow but worth it........,"I'm reading Philippa Gregory's books out of order--Other Boleyn Girl, Boleyn Inheritance, Queen's Fool, Constant Princess, Virgin Princess. However, the back story of Queen Katherine is not to be missed. I believe this is one of Philippa's earlier books, and arguably not her best--but I still couldn't wait to see how it turned out. (Yes, I must have missed English history in high school and college--at least I'm catching up now!) Not a romance novel and not a bland history book--excellent historical fiction. I'm wasn't previously interested in this era, but it was an excellent book recommendation from a friend. Thanks again, Philippa."
5,"Great history, fasinating storyline","I'm a big fan of Gregory's writing and this is definatly my favorite book by her. The characters in this book are very real and the history is great, also unlike some of her other books i didn't feel that she left out too much of the history which made the book much more enjoyable for me to read. The love story in this book was wonderful and because the characters seemed so real to me i felt like the romance didn't feel as forced or irrelivent as in sometimes does in her other books. If I had to give a critizem i would say that the time where Catherine in basically forced to stay in England after Aurther dies draged on too long and was a little boring but other than that, i would say that this is an amazing book and i think that whether you like gregory's writing because of the history of the character's romance this story will fasanate you."
2,The Constant Princess,"Disappointing. Not on a par with ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" by Gregory. I couldn't get past the historical innacuracies, such as portraying Henry VII as lusting after Katherine, and giving Katherine and Arthur a sexual relationship which is something most historians agree did not happen. For a much better historical fiction, read Jean Plaidy's ""Katharine of Aragon"". Or for historical accuracy, read Allison Weir's ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII""."
1,"Buy it for the pictures, not for the prose","How fitting that Wallace writes of 100 years of the orphanage's history. It takes about 100 years, and a lot of determination, to slog through her narrative. The Methodist church should excommunicate this author for doing such injustice to one of its finest institutions."
4,I've Missed This!!,"In the early 80's, Elektra created the Musician label for jazz recordings. On this label you could here top jazz artists of the time, either leading a group, or as side men. Sometimes you would here an artist woking as a sideman on a project you would never associate with him. If you haven't heard anything from this label, get it!This album was one of my favorites. McCoy Tyner was heavily into latin influences, and this was a good combo of old school and latin influences. The CD drops a star because of quality. Some of the numbers sound like a lower key and slower tempo than I recall from the LP. Still, it's god to have this one back in my collection."
5,Fred Gardner,"Richard Elliott won me over from all other sax players when I bought ""Chill Factor"". When I first got it, I only wanted to hear the title cut. But my CD player did me a favor I'll never be able to pay it back for. Everyday at the same time it would pop on by itself from the timer and this CD would play. The more it played the more I fell in love with it. I then took a long trip down Interstate 20 and this was the only CD that I wound up playing for 13 hours straight. I still can't get enough of it. It's smooth jazz at it's absolute best. 10 of my friend have bought it also. Why don't you be next!"
5,Awesome CD!,"This was the first Richard Elliot CD I bought, and I absolutely love it! It's so great that I want to start purchasing his older CD's. I recommend anyone who likes smooth jazz or saxophone playing in general buy this one."
3,"picking through the ""pieces""......","this is a pretty decent lp from the group who were still young at the time of this release, but on their 3rd lp. the opening title track is a very nice and warm instrumental with some nice playing on the synthesizer and piano. ""for the fun of it"" sounds like what you would hear as background music if you were on a basketball court back in the summer of 1983, lol, but the track is still good! ""fo-fi-fo"" got a little urban radio airplay from what i can remember, and the guys do a nice cover of quincy jones and herbie hancock's ""tell me a bedtime story"". these 4 tracks make for what is a decent album for a relaxing evening at home."
4,WICKED AND WONDERFUL,"Three stories in one book. (Didn't read 2 of them). ""Introduction to Seduction"" by Jamie Denton was sassy and hot. Jackson and Eden are police partners. She's a smart woman who is afraid of commitment (but doesn't realize it) and Jackson wants to commit to her. She's been told she's a dud between the sheets so she asks Jackson to ""teach"" her since his reputation has it that he's dynamite in bed. He changes the ""rules"" and tells her he will if she dates him exclusively. Their love scenes are erotic, sexy, and practicaly burn the pages! I give this story 5 stars!"
3,Not his best work,"I have read and enjoyed so much of what dear William has published including his 17 New Testament Commentaries. Romans is not his best work.William is so excellent at so many things: Providing the Jewish context behind the New Testament, explaining the motivations behind the various Epistles, as well as providing a treasury of literature to enrich the lessons.In Romans, Barclay's worldview collides with Paul. When William brings his Arminian/Universalist point of view to Romans 8:28-30 things break down. His explanation of this fascinating passage is self-contradictory. It would have been more useful if he had given his take on it and then highlighted that other theologians such as Augustine, Aquinas and Luther had a different interpretation. William does this so well in some of his other commentaries, but not here.William has great value, but take Romans with a grain of salt."
3,A Good Start,"This is helpful and informative, but is not a scholarly work. there are other more scholarly books available. i recommend this for bible study students, but not for theology students. more indepth books are available."
4,Enough is never enough,"If you are enthralled by Trillin's sharp insights and clever wit, and his devotion to his family,you can never get enough of this genius. May he live forever, so long as he keeps writing."
5,A lot of fun.,"Calvin Trillin is a delightfully funny writer, somewhat reminiscent of Dave Barry with a touch of Mike Royko thrown in. This book was written around the end of the 1980s, so some of the topics are a bit dated. This is no problem for those of us not only old enough to remember the late '80s, but old enough to find it hard to believe that they were really almost 20 years ago (wasn't all of that just the other day?) but younger readers might wonder what some of the columns were actually about. This makes it not only funny, but educational. Good for the young whippersnappers to discover that the world was already darned silly back in the dark ages. Maybe some of them will actually look up some of the topics and learn something. Maybe pigs will fly."
4,Disturbing Real Life Drama,"Following in the foot steps of other writer's of the horror genre, McCammon makes the move from monster/super-natural horror and into the world of terror that lurks on the fringes of our society. A page turner about a woman who knows the meaning of the word ""Mine.&quot"
5,Unordinary crazies,"It was a frightful read. McCammon succeeded in prickling my hair during scenes that were most ordinary yet destined to be repeated throughout the book. When I got my hands on the book its condition was grubby, its ratty covers scored perhaps by teeth marks, or sweaty hands--either was possible. I finished ""Mine"" in half the time a book that thick would usually take me. That's the highest praise I can give a bunch of prose."
3,Great story that needed to end a bit sooner,"""Mine"" is the second novel by Robert McCammon that I have read, the first being the excellent ""Swan Song"". Based on my enjoyment of ""Swan Song"" and the reviews on Amazon, I decided to give ""Mine"" a read. It was a very good story and I felt myself sickened (in the good, horror story sense) very early on (thank goodness it was only a doll!) and became gripped by a mother's love for her newborn child and her sheer determination to save him. The characters were well developed and the storyline moved along at a good and suspenseful pace. Ultimately, I think 15-25% less would have yielded more...just my take. I found myself antsy in the final 100 pages as it was pretty clear how it was going to end. At that point, it was more of a perfunctory gesture to finish the story and, in that, a let down from what could have been. So, a solid 3 overall with the first 3/4's a 5 and the final 1/2 a 2. I WILL still read more of Robert McCammon in the future."
4,Fasten Your Seat Belt And Prepare Yourself For An Exciting Ride!,"I've had Mine sitting on my bookshelf for over 16 years and finally got around to reading it. After finishing this exciting, pulse-pounding thriller I can assure you that my next book by McCammon will be read very soon. Mine is about Mary Terrell, aka Mary Terror, a survivor of a fanatical radical 60's group, who now lives in a hallucinary world of memories, guns and murderous rage. Mary, however, is happy at last because she has a beautiful baby boy...a baby she has stolen...and will kill to keep! Mine has enough drama, action, suspense and violence to fill several books. Be ready to forget about doing anything else once you start Mine. Enjoy!"
2,Looks like plain water to me,It is colorless and tasteless. For all I know I have a bottle of water with a label on it. It wasn't what I expected and did not compare with other silica products I've used. I think I'll switch back to my original choice.
4,Cute pop-up book.,"The story is simple: Oscar Otter wants to meet a goldfish, so after catching a glimpse of one, he starts searching for it. Six pages feature flaps to lift in the search. Each flap activates a pop-up or causes something to move. As the last page is opened, a full two-page pop-up is revealed. The artwork is very cute. However, the animals are realistically enough drawn, that the cooperation and friendship between predator and prey seems odd."
4,"Great performance, bad quality control by Sigma","This is truly an excellent lens. Very sharp wide open, and just awesome stopped down. The focus is fast, silent and accurate. I compared this lens and a Canon 70-200 f/2.8 USM, and the result was amazing. There was hardly any difference between the lenses( sharpnes, colour rendition, AF, FTM,...) The build quality of the Sigma is great, but I believe the canon 70-200 is better. The focus ring on the Sigma feels much better.I use it mainly for portraiture and at soccer games, and couldn't be happier with the lens.The reason I don't give the lens 5 starts is the Sigma's awful quality control. I had to try 3 copies of this lens before I got one with the performance I expect from an EX lens.I highly reccomend this lens, but don't be surprised if you have to try several copies."
5,"Intelligent, hilarious and just plain fun...","This is a very smart book. You'll never watch television news the same way again. It's a glimpse into the inner workings of modern media, entertainment and news that might just scare you into making your own decisions about the world.Daniel Price has written a rockin' story that's eye-opening and informative without being preachy like most media critiques. He's fair, well-informed and funny as hell. Slick is an absolute joy to read!"
1,How insulting.,"The whole premise of this movie is insulting to the troops who have died over there. I don't care if you support the war or not, have a little respect for the people who wear the uniform, dead and alive. And ask yourself, how would you feel if your family member had lost their life over there and you were to see this movie. I'm all for freedom of speech-my husband is defending that right-but have some compassion and some respect."
1,Have you no shame?,"The anti-war people just have no shame and it's no wonder that active duty, reserve and veterans voted 80-90% to re-elect George W. Bush.Piece of free advice to you libs that I know you won't take. We veterans don't appreciate you using images of our fallen brothers and sisters to promote your agenda. But do keep it up. It's like an iron-clad insurance policy against the military vote going the other way."
1,Thanks for raping the memory of our troops joe.....,"Oh how lovely. Joe Dante decided he was a political pundit now. Since it's apparent people will believe anything put to celluloid, I guess Mr. Dante decided that writing a book would be too much work. Everyday, new evidence is presented that debunks the myth's told by the left about the war. Could it be that with the facts piling up for the republicans, that good, patriotic(read socialist) liberals have decided to use their clout in their chosen industries to launch expensive, and visually appealing propaganda to help turn the tides in an election year? I am sure the jokes will be adequately funny, and the gore first rate; but if I really want funny Gore, I'll rent An Inconvenient Truth."
1,Horrible,"With the typical low production values, and the typical Hollywood loathing of America, this piece of drivel has topped the list of Anti-Troop garbage to come out as of late. Does anyone really watch a horror show on showtime to see the political brain-diarrhea from washed up hollywood liberals.This is typical of why Hollywoods profits are in the toilet."
1,Message over monster,"The only thing frightening about this little steaming pile is that Showtime greenlighted it.Why Dante just didn't come out in zombie makeup and rant and rave about his ignorant view of politics and the war is beyond me.I suppose that since his films have been poor for many years,he thought he'd Dixie Chick his work with false and manipulating propagandic messages.(Boy,hasn't that worked out for them too.)Perhaps he felt this would get some attention off his obvious lack of directorial skills,and get people to laud his courage to speak out(gee,like every thirty minutes you don't here a hollywood gasbag go off)I will give it one star for the unintentional laugh of having the dead vote democratic,but that is the only way they win anymore."
2,(1.5 stars) One of Masters of Horror,"This episode wasn't scary, where's the mutilation, gore, or people killing? Zombies didn't even eat people's flesh, they just wanted to vote and they die again. The ending was stupid and why did the guy kill the guy? And why did the guy wanted to shoot himslf, but didn't, when he could just run away, the zombies couldn't run? And what kind of zombies would talk too? Not good, not scary either. I really love Masters of Horror still, just not this episode."
4,Hard-hitting Horror,"A very clever premise and timely in view of the current ""war against terror"" fiasco."
5,Masters of Hilarious Horror,"I'm amused by the reviews here--from either political side--that take this as anything more than what it is. IT IS A HIGHLY ENTERTAINING SATIRE! I do not ascribe to the political beliefs put forth by this piece, that has never been a prerequisite to good entertainment. But is it funny?--oh, YES! Highly recommended as one of the finest Masters of Horror segments. Whether your Republican, Democrat, or completely uninterested in politics--this is an amusing poke at the political process taken to absurd proportions. I swear it won't corrupt or subvert you."
3,MoH: Homecoming,Entertaining. More disappointed in the fact that I have two #8 out of 13 Director cards. (Dario Argento-Jenifer is the other.)
4,Redneck Wonderland Falls Down!!!,"If you are a sheltered American who thinks that the US are the Goodies and the rest of the big bad world are the Baddies, then you need to watch this!The fact that an esteemed director like Joe Dante helms this cutting and strangely moving satire brings a ray of hope to the rest of us as we stand by stupified by the inane and insane fumblings of the current Presidential Administration.Watch this. It does feature zombies, it does have some grisly scenes, but ultimately it wins on many levels far above the gore genre. Just like the Original Dawn of the Dead, it pushes its message across with strength, wit and irony.YAY!!!!!! More people are waking up!!!!!!!"
5,A soothing Holiday work of art!,"This New Age Christmas CD, ""Season Traditions"", is very soothing and moving. It simply flows! You may think that you do not like solo piano, however, this creative, uniquely beautiful, CD will move and inspire you and it is certainly for all ages. It certainly is not ""just another Christamas CD"". Obviously, George Skaroulis has an abundance of natural talent - very gifted! It is a superb holiday CD that can be listened to throughout the year - I've been playing it over and over and it certainly deserves five stars. His last song of a ""Greek New Year"" is really original and a nice touch. This has been my first experience with George Skaroulis' music and I intend to purchase more of his CD's!"
3,Better Mileage but very Loud!,"I have had this on my 08 Ram 1500 for a month now and have seen an improvement in fuel mileage. I went from 12 to 14 MPG around town. I do not know if the intake kit is making the difference or the fact that when you are more than quarter throttle the noise from the intake is obnoxious. I tend to be very light on the peddle to prevent the noise, which is so loud that my children will start to cry. Also I had to modify some of the brackets that were different than in the instructions. The air temp sensor is a twist and lock in the factory air box but K&N only has a rubber grommet that you press the sensor in, therefore I had it fall out after test driving and had to safety wire it in to get it to stay in place."
5,Gets better and better,"This album features the same lineup as the group ""Sphere"" - with Kenny Barron repaced by Larry Willis on piano.Gary Bartz is an exceptional Alto player, who also plays beautiful soprano (on tracks 3 and 6). His playing is not revolutionary or anything, it is just a big, warm sound combined with great rhythmic intensity and deep roots in the Jazz tradition. He is definately someone the younger musicians should listen to and learn from.The other musicians are Willis, BUster williams on bass and Ben Rily on drums. They play together - changing moods and rhythms effortlessly.Every track on the cd features strong performances by all participants, but I personally have a special liking to track 8 (a fast cooker) and 7 (a warm ballad).This cd has an added value - it has some kind of general positive atmosphere to it. It is highly recommended, of course."
4,prescise and intense melody..this band would be great live,I can't wait to see them live and await further release
5,Oklahoma Math Rock at its finest,So this is where Oklahoman Music Makers are going....I Wish. This is an amazing album from guys that take after their layered guitar brotheren Hum and Shiner. This much music coming from only 3 people still amazes me. There is so much good that I can hardly begin to describe it all. The lyrics are very well written and I can actually understand them and their meanings (sorry Hum..I can't say this about you.) About Tomorrow's Mileage is simply full of what good music is all about. I wish someone could enlighten me as to which water source these guys are drinking from...I'd really like a glass.
3,Pink Case,This case is a lovely pink - goes great with the phone. But is too snug on the phone. I had to cut the pastic sides a bit because it kept pressing on the side camera buttons and the side volume button. Would have prefered a looser fit.
1,"Bad luck, maybe?",Bought this as a gift. Arrived late and broken. Tried to get a replacement and it never came. I dunno if it was because it was sent to Hawaii. The umbrella itself was pretty.
5,Don't Hesitate If You Like McGoohan,"Initially I would not have agreed that these 25-minute shows could measure up in any way to the later 52-minute Danger Man shows, but after watching this set I would have to change my mind. They are in some ways even better because Drake is a bit more naive and you can see he hasn't been hardened yet and is a long way from becoming the cynical and ocassionally bitter agent in the later shows. The picture and sound quality of this set alone makes it worth having for any McGoohan fan. I bought a DVD set of a recent TV series produced this century and it didn't look nearly as good as these episodes from 44 years ago--and that's the truth."
5,Dolphin Dreams is too smooth.,I lived in Albuquerque NM when I first heard this album. Dolphin Dreams reminds me of the view I saw from the Sandia Mountains. Mellow and soothing.
2,No good for actual use,This is a product I would not recommend. I chose it for my 8 year old daughter for her martial arts classes. The padded tubing is too light weight to swing in a predictable direction (think of yarn or cloth). The foam padding looked like it had been cut with dull sissors and the cord was too long for the smaller sized nunchuckus. If you want something for a costume (appearance only) these may work. I wanted more.
2,"These are toys, not suitable for training","I bought these hoping that my small 7 year old could use them for weapons training. Standard nunchaku are far too big for her though she has to use them in competitions and tests. We've been looking for shorter ones to practice with at home. These were labeled as ""more substantial than toy versions"" but the reality is they are not. They are foam rubber over a thin tubing. The foam extends past the internal tube and will tear in one or two uses. These are PERFECT for a costume or play. Nothing else."
2,"Size right for younger kids, but too light","A 8 inch nunchuka is sized right for a small child's hands and I don't expect foam ones to be durable at all. Think of these things as disposable after a few months of use. The thing I didn't like about these is how light the foam was. It gives the nunchuka very little momentum so it's actually a bit more difficult to use. It just uses a less dense foam. It's probably personal preference, but my kids prefer the higher density foam -- the weight different is negligible, but it makes a difference in the way it handles."
3,Works fine for a 5 year old,Got these for my 5 year old Yellow Belt to use in class. Instructor approved them. Inexpensive & are just fine for young children. Way too light for advanced training.
5,great sling,"Great product, love the quality. I use it for work every day. so much better to carry hands free."
5,This book made me miss my subway stop,"As soon as I took this book out of its bag, I fell into a hypnotic world of haloes, feral horses, wheelchairs, madrigals, caravans & cabbages, all coexisting magically under ""The North Star hanging/Like an umlaut over all of us"". The poems are remarkable, simultaneously figurative and direct. Consider this rendering of parental demise: ""First, my father died. Then my mother/Did. My father died again."" Or, unrequited love: ""I will go on loving as I love the backs/Of things and the invisible,"" This is Brock-Broido at her best-inventive, sensual, profound and sobering--but not sober. She ices her cake with sly sprinklings of humor: ""We were preparing to miss our President and his/Long resplendent, minky hands"""
2,Just the icing,"So much talent for language here, yet the poems read like filler. Look inside yourself, Lucie Brock-Broido. Be more honest with yourself; you are so much better than this."
2,Discoveries... Argentina:Patagonia,This video is a sales promo for a fly fishing resort. Beautiful photos and some good history but not what I expected.
1,Learn 2 not be seduced by advertising ...,"This product offers a very disappointing Out-Of-Box-Experience. I could never hear it make a note on my XP system. The manual says ""Please note that when you press a key on the keyboard, you will not hear any sound. In order to play a sound, you will need to configure your music software. Please consult with your music software manual"". Well, since I don't have 'music software' I'm out of luck. I just thought this product would have some computerized keyboard lessons - which it very well may, but you need to own and understand 'music software', which is an entirely external expense, with a huge learning curve of its own. This is the 2nd bad OOBE I've had with m-audio, and, thank heavens, it's the last! Fortunately for me, Amazon.com has a great return policy!"
3,"Good planning guide, but not helpful once there...","We just spent five days in Cannes, France. This book was great as a pre-trip planning guide to do preliminary research the area and the sites to see. The wonderful pictures got us very excited for the trip.However, once there, we found the guide book didn't have enough practical information, such as how to get to the sites. (It was shear luck we found the Matisse Museum in Nice) It gave a great overview of the entire area of Provence and the Cote D'azur, but didn't go into depth enough on any one place to be your only guide book.I was very impressed with one of the resteraunts they recommended. It was one of the ""least expensive"" restaurant and was one of the best meals we have ever had. While the quanity of recommended resteraunts was not there, I would continue to get the DK travel books if the quality is as good."
5,Great guide,"Just returned from a trip to Nice, Villefranche, St Jean Cap Ferrat, and Monte Carlo and this is the guide we lived by."
4,Provence comes to life!,"This book has it all...colorful photos, lots of interesting & historical background...a very good book if you're planning a visit to this region. Highly recommended."
5,Guidebook,My wife and I used this book to find our way to great places in the south of France and Monaco. We recommend.
4,good information and good photos,"This was a good, helpful book in planning my trip to Provence. The tidbits of info were insightful and the photos were enticing."
5,Great Muddy Water-style blues,"I bought this CD after attending a blues guitar workshop with the artist and was thoroughly impressed with his blues guitar mastery. He has had an opportunity to meet and learn some licks from almost all the great blues legends including Muddy Waters. Some of the tracks on this CD are his own originals while others are old blues classics. If you are a fan of blues guitar solos then this CD won't disappoint, particularly if you are a guitarist looking for new licks. Morgan Davis himself is a very genuine, down-to-earth person and this comes through in his music as it should it all good blues. If you are a blues fan (delta blues) then you will definitely not go wrong by taking a chance on this unknown gem."
1,Terrible taste,"I would never suggest buying this product. I thought it might be interesting, but it had a terrible taste, and didn't lubricate at all. The only thing I would use this for would be as a gag gift."
4,Humorus,Keep you laughing and a good film to watch. Another great Madea movie made again. This is good to see some values being put out in front of public.
2,Tyler Perry's Madea's Witness Protection,I was disappointed with this TYLER PERRY movie. I have liked every movie that he made but this one. There wasn't enough content to hold my interest.
2,Don't touch some of Madea's other stuff!,This does not compare to some of the other movies and plays. This one started off boring. Got a little better and then no excitement.
4,Funny show not for small children,Adult humor and some course themes should be avoided by those under 12. Funny show otherwise with laugh out loud moments.
3,Fan of Madea,"This isn't the best Madea flick, but it is entertaining. Good to watch on a day when nothing is on."
4,Funny!!! Madea didnt disappoint,If you get the chance watch any Tyler Perry movie you wont be sorry that you did. Each of his movies have a message in with the humor. Messages that we all need to hear and may I say more than once.
3,Just Ok,"I feel asleep on some of it. I found myself wondering, when is this movie going to end! Some parts were funny."
4,Funny As Always,I always enjoy Madea. It is what I expect from Tyler Perry. I was pleasantly surprised that I was also able to watch the movie immediately on my computer. Thank you for the added gift.
2,Tyleer Perry's Madea's Witness Protection,Not as good as the other ones by Tyler Perry Movies I have seen.. I would ony give it 2 staris..
3,A few laughs but not as many as I've come to expect,"This one seemed like they were reaching a little bit with the story line. That being said, Madea can't help but be funny."
3,Funny but not well-written,"I liked the movie. It didn't have a very good story flow. It seemed like some scenes were added just to lengthen the movie (like when a person adds words to a term paper in order to get enough words).That said, my family and I laughed a lot!"
2,MuviLover,I would not rate this at the top of Madea's movie collection and I love Madea. I can see where they tried to write a good movie but it got lost somewhere in the acting. If I could go back I would of rented something else.
4,Your typical Medea movie,"The movie was not as hilarious as some of the previous ones, however it still was funny. There was a bit of overacting on some characters, and the storyline perhaps did not or I should say was not as developed as could be in my opinion, but overall it was still a funny movie, and I enjoyed watching it"
2,Awful Acting,"I think the mistake may have been putting Eugene Levy in this. His acting did not work in this movie at all!!!! Tyler Perry is hysterical, but everything else, just brought it down. Denise Richards...not working either. Very disappointed! The trailer was funny and I had really high hopes."
2,ok movie,"I love all madeas movies, but this movie is ok they nee more action, really disappointing hope next one it get better...."
3,Ms Madea,I always enjoy Tyler Perry's work. This movie lacked the typical humor I expect from Madea and friends. I probably wouldn't watch it over and over like I do his other movies.
5,Great Movie!,"If you like Madea, you will like this movie. Just watch it and laugh. Don't compare Madea movies, just take them as they are. This one will make you laugh, it may not be as great as some of the others but its still funny."
3,Good but misses the mark,"I enjoyed Witness Protection, unfortunately for me it just missed the mark. The supporting cast except for eugene levy appeared to be struggling. The other Madea films were funnier."
5,Very Funny,"Would've loved to see more of Madea's antics in this but all in all, it was a good movie. Would watch again."
4,It's ok,"It is not Tyler Perry's funniest movie. However, it is funny but at times seems kind of pushed for comedy."
1,This movie sucked. Every funny scene was in the trailer.,"This movie was terribly written and the acted was just as bad. Don't pay for it. Even if it was free, you will never get those two hours of your life back."
5,Amazing!,"This movie is so funny, everyone should own this movie. It's fun for the whole family. There's nothing i disliked."
3,Product Review,"If you like Madea, I guess. This is just my opinion and I'm writing this because in order to leave a review I must have a certain amount of words in my review. Really!!! AYFKM. Jusy Saying."
4,Good Movie,"I enjoyed this movie very much, it is not my favorite though. It is not quite Mr. Perry's usual style of panache, but it is still a good watch."
2,meh,Not Tyler Perry's usual quality and intensity. Maybe if Madea would have actually put the girl's head into the toilet...
3,ALL right,Its alright. Tyler perry films are great although it could be better. Although Im not going to lie there were really good funny moments at times.
3,A Little Disappointed,I was a little disappointed in this movie. Tyler Perry must was very tired and distracted when he wrote this storyline. It was slow and I didn't like the motive. It didn't have a lot of comedy as all the others. Not a hit in my book. I would wait for the cost togo down before I reccomend anyone to purchase it. Or better yet rent it from RedBox.
2,Disappointed,"Pg13 is not the correct rating in my opinion. After seeing the madea stage plays in the past I thought this movie would be somewhat similar. The fact that one of the characters kept insinuating that African Americans men have longer ""blanks"" by how they use the bathroom and that they like bigger rear ends on women so they can slap them and position them was so offensive to me as a christian. I won't be watching or using these shows anymore. I really liked madea shows but not anymore. Of course this is my opinion only"
4,Hilarious!,This was a good and entertain movie. Just not my all time favorites from TP. I think they could have played on the family + Madea relationship a little more. Although Madea on the plane was the bomb!
3,Not great,Not Tyler Perrys best work. Madea wasn't as funny as expected. Left me feeling disappointed. It was okay but not amazing.
3,Tyler Perry's Madea's Witness Protection,"It started off very slow, and boring. But half way thru the movie it get better. I am glad I wanted for the DVD to come out."
3,Tyler Perry's Madea's Witness Protection,"This movie is just o.k. A bit disappointing, since I am a Madea fan. I still love Tyler Perry movies."
4,madea witness,did like it that much wasn't as funny i thoyght it was going to be. i would tell my friend to watch it if you want to laugh
4,Just okay,"Thought Madea had many more opportunities to give us her usual 'spunk,' but lacked the usual funny Madea punch lines."
3,Made me laugh,Tyler Perry could do no wrong in my book so I liked it. Can't wait for his next film.Charisse Chase
3,Madea's Witness Protection,"I rated this movie 3 stars, because it was not as funny as prior movies and Tyler Perrry's character was more towards the FBI Investigator he wass playing.J. JonesStaten Island, NY"
4,Madea strikes again lol,I liked this Madea movie and I am not a great fan of Madea movies. I rented this on a day when I was not feeling well and had to stay on the couch. It really was amusing and one of the best.
5,Great movie!,I enjoyed every minute of this movie. Great cast and storyline. There wasn't a dull moment. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves to laugh.
4,Funny,Good movie and funny. Like all of Tyler Perry's this movie has a message AND is entertaining! I would watch it again!
3,Funny Moview,"This moview had a funny middle section, but the beggining and end were a bit underplayed. I watched a few other Madea movies, and this wasn't my favorite."
4,M,A great bargain and additon to my collection. It was'nt as funny as other movies Perry produce but it was worth buying.
5,Funniest Madea yet!,I pretty much laughed throught the whole movie! Madea does things that we wish we could do. Taste the rainbow!!!
4,"FUNNY, Madea is great","Great story line, love Madea. The cast was wonderful. One of my favorite Tyler Perry movie. Can't wait for the next one."
2,Its not Tyler Perry's best,To begin with Tyler Perry's movies never seem to be that good yes hey have some funny things here and there yet the audience can tell hes trying too hard to be funny. Well this one had hardly any funny jokes or physical comedy and they where trying way to hard and the movie wasn't written well doesn't seem like it was smooth it seems like someone just tried to crush parts of the puzzle together
2,Very Weak - but try to support Tyler Perry,This was not one of his better Madea's movie. Way too much dialogue and not enough funny moments. There great actors but the story line was weak
2,2 Stars For Effort,"I gave this movie 2 stars for effort. I took my younger cousin to see this movie when she was in town...needless to say, I was highly disappointed in it. I did laugh on some parts. I don't even know how the movie ended because I fell asleep towards the end...or at least I think it was the end lol. The idea for it was awesome for a movie idea, but when Tyler put it together, it didn't come together brilliantly like the idea...just saying. To each its own though...the guy that worked at the movie theater gave rave reviews about it, even said he saw it twice...but when I got in there...definitely a thumbs down. You missed it this time Tyler."
3,Typical Madea,This is a typical Tyler Parry Madea film. It is funny but not overly clever. If you have seen other films in the series than you know what to expect.
5,Very promt,This was a request for Christmas and to my shock I had it just as descried in about a week.
2,A little disappointed!,I didn't like this movie! I was a little disappointed especially since I love Tyler Perry movies. Didn't laugh much at all. It will truly not make one of Tyler Perry's best movie list!!
3,Not Like The Rest,"I have purchased everything Mr Perry has produced and watch over & over again. Not this. Good,but not as good as others. I don't know where he was going with this one"
3,Don't watch this crap.,I don't like Tyler Perry's movies. I down right think they are stupid. But my family seems to enjoy them so I have to put up with them. I don't know why people think they are funny. If you were smart there are much better movies out there then his.
3,Madea,Kinda expected it to be funnier. I guess since there are so many of these movies already. Maybe I set my expectations to high. I would wait till the price goes down to get this movie
4,Good Movie,"So funny, yet has a very good message as always. Tyler Perry has done it again. Can't wait to see what is next."
5,"Funny, Funny, Funny","What else can you say about Tyler Perry creations, but funny, funny, funny. The viewer will be rolling with laughter after watching Madea's Witness Protection"
4,Madea,"good comedy, not great but still classic Madea. storyline is a little lacking depth but purposed story is very classic to Tyler Perry's happy endings."
5,Madea,My grandson simply loves all of the Madea movies. So now he can view them anytime he likes and not worry about renting them.
2,Ma -D-E-A !!!!!,"Yes, I gave this movie two stars. I'm a big Tyler Perry fan, but his ""Madea"" movies are starting to get predictable and boderline boring. This movie really left me hanging, Madea taking in a white family under the witness protection program. In reality, a family would not be placed with a individual that has a criminal record. But, anyway for comedy sake I get it! But the storyline was written like a cheesy unrelateable sitcom. I lost interest half way through the movie and was tempted to just turn it off and watch something else. I'm glad I didn't pay $12 to see this at the movies .. I hope the next Tyler Perry movie staring Madea will be more engaging and entertaining .. this movie was unforgetable and a waste of time to watch."
3,Very disappointing,"I guess we can't win them all and not everything is going to be a success. I love Tyler Perry, but this movie didn't have the great action-comedy as his previous ones did. It was bland, often-times phony, but bearable. I'm just glad I didn't waste my money going to see it in the theater."
3,Tyler Perry's Witness Protection,"It was interesting. It was Tyler Perry as Madea on the big screen once again. Not what you would expect from Tyler Perry, but it was Tyler Perry!"
4,Madea's Witness Protection,"Madea's Witness ProtectionI enjoyed the movie, not as much as his others, but is was good. I would recommend the film. I think Tyler Perry is excellent as an actor, producer and director.Mona D. Griffin"
4,Tyler Perry does it again,This was another hilarious offering from Tyler Perry.Thoroughly enjoyable.This a movie the entire family can watch and enjoy together and enjoy.We did!
2,streaming not good!,"The movie I like, streaming is /has not been a good experience, every one I have tried to watch stops & starts so many times plus never finishes is very frustrating."
3,"OK movie, not as good as ""Happy Family""","This movie was fun. I liked the bigger star names who were in it. My favorite is still ""Happy Family""."
5,witness protection,"what a hoot. I love all of these Madea movies,. Tyler Perry knows how to make reality funny and touching"
3,Not as good,"Tyler has done better, I didn't laugh as much on this one and others in past, he need to take a break, and relax, he's making them too close together"
5,Love this movie,I have never seen a Tyler Perry movie that I didn't like and this one was no exception. Madea is in rare form.
5,Madea's Witness Protection,Awesome movie as always Mr Tyler Perry has created another master piece Thanks. Hope Madea is never retired lol!!Tyler Perry's Madea's Witness Protection
1,I never ever rented this,"Rent this I never ever....EVER. I fear that, even as I type, the elves in the bowels of amazon are etching this movie in my permanent stone profile tablet, providing a preference I will live with till the day I die beware kind folks of the odd random choice. A mistaken romantic comedy in the first decade of the century could someday prevent you the house, the love...the life you so desperately desire. be forewarned."
1,Tyler Perry's Madea's Witness Protection,Awful movie. Very preachy and predictable. Only laughed 1 time. Characters were not developed logic was thrown out the window an acting was stiff
1,Terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I really give this movie no star, very poorly done a waste of money to see it, I'am very displeased with this movie"
1,Please retire Madea,"The Madea character and her affiliates have, unfortunately, come to an end. The acting by all is forced. Predictable punchlines and humor dried up long before the movie credits FINALLY played. Find a new project or walk away, but please let Madea retire while she's still a good memory versus a Nightmare on Elm Street part 20."
1,Not the best.. by a long shot,I was hoping this movie would be at least as good as the others. This is the least least funny Madea movie I've ever seen.
3,Average Humor,Not as funny as I hoped but it was entertaining. A better plot would help. Duplicating Whoopie Goldberg's scene in Ghost was unappealing.
2,TP's Witness Program,"In my view, it was lacking in entertainment. For the most part, it was a time filler with no real excitement. I was disappointed in the sustance of the story."
3,kind of let down,not as good as some of Tyler Perry's movies....Big Happy Family and Madea goes to jail is the best so far.
3,Funny yet predictable,"good laughs, good actors, predictable. Surprisingly good acting from Denise Richards, I haven't seen her in a while. Good to see Eugene Levy too!"
5,New Madea movie,I loved the movie. Tyler Perry does great comedy. Madea reminds me of my grandmother. I highly recommend this movie. It's worth the money. It rocks.
3,NOT as good as the original first (2) movies!,"This was a very good entertaining movie. However, it's not as funny as the first (2) Madea movies. The sound quality and Cinematography is of the highest quality I have ever seen in a movie. The storyline is very easy to follow. The acting, wardrobe and sets are very good. The special effects are obvious yet passable. Overall, not the best Madea movie, but it was ok at best and very entertaining. I do recommend buying on Blue ray as these types of movies are great to own and to revisit again at some point in the future. Thanks"
5,Tyler Perry just keeps getting better.,I have loved all of Tyler Perry's movies. He sure knows how to make Madea move the audience. The cast members he chose for this movie were perfect and helped create more great Madea moments!
3,One of his better efforts,"I've only seen two Tyler Perry movies. Madea's Witness Protection and I Can Do Bad All By Myself.Witness Protection was a fairly standard fish out of water comedy. Eugene Levy stole the show. Denise Richards, not so much. The bodily function jokes were kept to a minimum in this movie, and the plot was topical, what with all the corporate scandals going on these days. It's a good movie to watch for $3.99 on a cold weekend afternoon when your chores were all done in the morning and you have some spare time on your hands.In comparison to I Can Do Bad All By Myself, this movie does not have the ""preachifying"" that I understand is a staple of Tyler Perry's films. Yes, there is a scene with a preacher and a choir, but Witness Protection had nothing like the half-hour-plus trip to church that I Can Do Bad All By Myself did. I hope that Tyler Perry can limit the sermonizing in the future and feature more of his comedic timing as Madea, because it was truly spot-on in both films."
3,Okay,Not as funny as original Madea's movie (the diary of a mad black woman) but it still will make you laugh or smile at times.
4,shun's review,"I would have enjoyed knowing a little more about the plot, and how it compared with other Tyler Perry movies. It would have been easier if I could have rented the movie in advance, but the only option avaiable was to buy. I thought the movie was very funny, though it deviated from similiar Tyler Perry movie. I recommed anyone who enjoys comedy with a splash of seriousness to see this movie."
2,Tyler Perry's Madea's Witness Protection,"This movie was Madea ""lite"". I was waiting to see the old Madea to come out swinging and taking name later. But it never happened. So many missed opportunities. Very disappointed."
1,No sound horrible,I want my money back no sound from Amazon app movies. Perfect sound from Netflix. How do I get my money back please?
1,Weak,"Weak acting and story line, couldn't make it through 30 minutes. Characters were overly predictable and storyline predictable not enough typical funny madea to catch us early in the movie."
1,Lame,"Not Tyler's best, not even close. Come on, who in the world convinced him that Denise Richards could act? The out-takes at the end of the movie were funnier than the movie itself. This script had SO MUCH potential, I just want to thump Mr. Perry's head for the terrible end product. What really burned me was that I paid $12 to see this dog in the theater - I REALLY wish I had waited for it to come out on DVD and rented it for a buck at Kroger."
3,It was okay,"I like most Madea movies, but this one was not as interesting as people said that it was. I didn't exactly hate the movie but I would've been real upset if I had gone to the movies on opening night to see this(there were long lines on opening night)."
4,Better,"Much better then ""Goes to jail"" but still not liek the old Tyler Perry movies and not as good as his plays but still good for a laugh and this one is more family oriented. (sp)"
3,Okay Movie,"I don't recommend movies, this was okay for a few hours of useless movie watching. The acting is a bit lame."
4,Ttyler Perry very funny,"Tyler Perry movies are very funny,i always love Madea..He always entertains,,some thing for every one... this review is a minimum of words i was finished already .."
4,Cute! Typical Tyler Perry movie,"Good laughs and clean enough for families to enjoy together. It has a lot of the same ""Madea"" material in it."
3,A No 4 Sho,This has to be by far the worst movie that Tyler Perry has produced.There was less funny for the money.
5,Madea,"It is always fun to watch Madea and her many adventures!! This movie has an all star cast. Everybody did a good job with regards to acting. This is a feel good movie with many laughs!! It is always fun to imagine somebody's grandmother acting a fool and doing everything ""out the norm"" yet delivers a great lesson learn while doing it. I love Madea!!!!!!!"
3,Just ok,"Not as funny or clever as previous Madea movies, but an ok watch if you've got nothing else going on."
2,I miss the classic Madea,"In the earlier movies, such a Dairy of a Mad Black Woman, Madea Goes to Jail, or Family Reunion, Madea was a likeable character even if she could be very aggressive and in your face, because it was coming from the right place. It was easy to cheer her on when she was wreaking havoc, because she offered pearls of wisdom along the way.The plot for this movie was slapdash, and Madea was not very likeable in this, she just came across as more vindictive (in a needless way) and really annoying. All in all, if you like Madea, avoid this movie."
2,So So!!!,"Tyler Perry had better movies, this one is no has funny and message oriented has the other movies he made. Did not enjoy it has other movies."
2,Ugh...,"I've heard it said that if you can't say anything good about something, then don't say anything at all. Well, I am going to go against this old adage, and say, that this is probably the worst Tyler Perry production so far. It was vapid, empty of substance, not funny or entertaining, and not the least bit compelling, or provocative... If you are a Madea/Tyler Perry collector, then I guess you can add it to your collection, but otherwise, you can afford to skip it."
4,Madea is hysterical,"The story was good with a strong moral, but Madea really adds a lot of flavor to the movie. We especially like the parts when Madea is on screen."
4,Funny and always has a lesson,I like Tyler Perry. As Madea he is hilarious! But Madea always has good advice somewhere in there. I would reccomend this. Always a good laugh!
2,Another TP Movie,"I watched this movie hoping it would be different from ALL of the other Madea movies, but it was a typical TP movie...same plot, same story line, same tired lines."
2,Not funny,"Not the usual funny Medea. Dialog was not up to usual TP standards. Funny scenario, but no punch. in script."
3,My daughter loved it.,"I think the Madea franchise has been a pretty decent boon for family time movies: They are kind of hip and cutting edge, yet you can watch with your kids without fear of there being too much bad stuff you don't want them to see. Kids love her!"
3,It's a Tyler Perry movie.,It had it's moments but really it's just another excuse for Perry to cash in again on Madea. It's kind of like returning to see your favorite stand up comic with a new special if you're in to that. For me it was just... meh.
3,Entertaining,I didn't care much for this one. It didn't quite follow the usual Madea character. Wasn't as funny but entertaining.
1,poorly written homespun travelogue,Purchased this author's books to learn about the travel/camping experience to various places - would NEVER recommend this author - absolutely immature presentation; poorly written; total disappointment - waste of money!! This goes for all the books by Joey C. Hossack.
4,Frank from Maine,"Barbara Lea is in excellent voice on this cd. She is one of the great ones that is respected and loved in New York City and has been for some decades. The reason to buy this CD is the cut #5: Killing Time. It's one of the best renditions you will ever hear. The woman has genius. A lot of people do not know her, but she has been worshiped by a cult since the mid-50s. When she hits it there has never been anybody that hits it better. She hits it on the Killing Time cut. It will break your heart."
4,"Pretty colors, Top runs just a tad small","If this is a one size fits most, I do not recommend for anyone over 135 pounds. I am 125 and the part below the balconette (bra section) is really fitted, and doesn't have much give. Love the colors, and fits my body type really well though!"
5,Problem Solved,I used to forget my wallet but I always had my blackberry so I bought this then since I take my phone every where but not my wallet This salved the problem. This is good for people who forget their wallet or phone but remember to bring the other.
4,Early cyber history well told,"If Paul Dirac was a ""Most Unusual Man"" so to was Turing. He and John von Neumann gave us programing and Turing's work at Bletchly Park was of critical help in solving the German codes."
2,print too small to read.,An embarrassment of bookmaking. The type is much too small. I was looking forward to owning this in paper but will now have to buy on kindle.
1,Low Paper Quality,No doubt this is a masterpiece in terms of contents. But I have to say the quality of the paper and print is really bad. Even hard to read. Bad experience.
2,Poor digital copy,"The digital version of this book is very poor. It is missing letters, has repeated paragraphs, etc, makes for more difficult reading. More quality control is needed!"
2,Too much detail for me,"I found the story of Alan Turing's life to be very interesting. His original work on dreaming up a ""thinking machine"" that would eventually become what we know as a computer and his work on breaking the German ""enigma"" code are worth knowing about. His tragic end is cause for us all to remember the importance of tolerance. However, I found this book to be too long and detailed for my tastes. I think the story could have been told in one half or one third the space. So I would recommend that anyone interested in the history of science read a biography of Turing, but a different one than this book."
4,Great Resource,This study guide and its accompanying CD make a great resource for those studying for the GED test and for those who want to brush up on their high school basic skills. Loaded with sample tests and examples. It is a well-written book and the software is easy to use and provides feedback and answers to quizzes. A slight issue is that this is the 2006 version and I had anticipated that is was a more recent version but it is still quite helpful and relevant.
3,Good,"This is exactly what we needed. The look, quality, functionality, price and delivery were very satisfactory.we were pleased with everything. A really big-ass book, perhaps,one day it may even get read."
5,Great help,"This book really helped me out a lot. Even tho I am not a native English speaker, I managed to pass my GED ""above average""."
1,GED,I bought this for a friend to help prepare her for the GED tgest. I found many math formula's incorrect and this is very difficult to follow for the average person trying to prepare for the GED test. I don't like this book at all!!
3,good,Good but not Great. Could be more specific with the Language sections on how to perform certain excercises.
4,guide for preparing for test,provides necessary information and practice tests to prepare one for actual ged testing. Provides similar questions to test and helps student improve knowledge of weak subject areas.
5,G. E. D. Study Book Review.,I would recommend this book for any Adult Ed Student that doesn't have an Adult Ed School to go to.
1,Not what I ordered.... NO CD ROM,"Did not come with CD ROM???Hard to get a hold of the company to get refund or CD.... I am very disappointed... Plus, took over a week to get to me."
1,LOUSY BOOK!!!,ok so this bok completely sucks!!!!!!!!! i bought this for myself in preparation for specifically the math portion of the GED and there are so many errors in this book it has poor explanations and does not provide full and effective teaching methods to learn from. some of the math questions are much easier to work out from how the book shows it to be done. overall its lame and if i could give it 0 stars i would! my math ged is coming up nd i feel so unprpared bcuz i wasted my time with this retarded book!
5,Big book of help,Easy to understand and learn from.Includes everything needed to sucessfully prepare for the GED test.This is a book you will want to keep around for general reference and refresher knowledge for years to come.
4,Helpful,"This book was very helpful. I passed my GED on the first try. I didnt take any classes, I just studied this book. Very good book, I might add!!"
5,Great help,My sister used this and some additional online resources and passed her GED with flying colors. Well laid out and lots of practice test. Its a long read but you are getting a high school education in one book so that is expected.
3,"Book was great, CD was not","The book was well written and organized. However the CD was Windows only. We have Macs, and could not use the CD at all. Not good. The info on Amazon did not specify the CD was not cross platform. Please fix this."
5,Great Help!,"My kids were all home schooled, and so had to take the GED.Both have passed the practice tests with flying colors, even the math, thanks to this book! The pre-tests helped to identify the areas they needed to work in so they didn't focus on areas that they had already mastered. My youngest, aged 15, is now ready for the test, 3 years ahead of schedule."
3,the ged book and cd review,the book finally came after almost two week delivery. And my son is just ok with it. The cd only ocvers the pre-test not on how to do the work or study so it's just ok for us.thanks
2,3 weeks waiting for it!,I have to take the quiz on monday and I just got the book after 3 long weeks waiting it!!
1,Pituitary Disorder: comprehensive management,Unfortunately I did not receive the book till now 25/04/2009.Please inform me as soon as possible if I'll receive it or not.Many thanks.Ali Ayyad
2,"Doesn't shred staples, envelopes or labels!!","Purchased this item....read materials before I plugged it in....can't shred staples, envelopes or labels!! Couldn't believe it!! Took it back and ordered a different brand....will read warnings before I purchase next item and make sure it shreds all of the above and more.....Hope this helps...."
2,too old,It's just too old and outdated. It's worth it to spend the money and get the latest edition if you want to have best idea of the real needs and struggles that need prayer around the world. The newest edition is amazing though.
5,An excellent resource for mission research,Operation World is a one of a kind book. It is an extremely useful resource giving an overview of what is happening in the world of Christian missions today. An updated edition is greatly needed!!
3,Ecumenism,That is the biggest problem with this book. The fact that cults and Catholicism are included as Christian should be disturbing to any bible believing Christian. It is too bad the author felt compelled to sell out the Gospel in order to sell books.
1,More like World Domination,This book sounds like something out of the Crusades where Christians want to overthrow all other religions. I wonder what the author would think of other religions writing a book to overthrow Christianity?
2,"""M"" series Sony camcorder battery charger/shipping delays","This product took far too long to arrive although no ""out of stock"" warning appeared on the sale page. The expected deilvery date increased over time until it reached a six week wait. I wrote to Amazon and asked about the delay telling them I wished to cancel because I was leaving on a trip and needed the charger. They replied by email telling me that the expected delivery date was actually sooner than the time stated on my account. They shipped it anyway, and did not mention my request to cancel. The charger arrived within three days following my call. By this time, I'd purchased another charger from another company with no tax, free shipping and $20 cheaper. This was not a satisfactory transaction as I also had to pay to ship the original one back to Amazon. RD Anderson"
4,Indispensible for those interested in this subgenre of pulp,"Jones's book focuses on the subgenre of pulp known as the ""weird menace"" tale. Due to the sensational nature of these stories they were neglected. Jones was one of the few original critics in this area. His book covers different magazines, publishers, and authors. He also focuses on different conventions within the subgenre. One shortcoming of the book is that, at times, it seems to rely too much on quotes directly from the primary texts (pulps). On an entertainment level, Jones's exuberance easily translates through his writing. This book is hard to find, but worth it for fans and scholars of the ""weird menace"" tale."
3,Beautiful Pix,"It took me about fifteen minutes to read this book. Despite the cheap glasses the drinks are photographed in, the photos are beautiful."
5,A Very Moving CD,I love this CD! I've been listening to it to get my spirit ready for the high holy days and even shared the music with my cantor who wants to incorporate some of the melodies into our services. My favorites are V'Al Kulam and La Yehudim.
4,Interesting Perspectives on Challenging Kids,"I have read dozens of parenting books and usually find them not applicable to my situation. While I do have special needs kids (both are on the Autism Spectrum), challenges are still challenges. This book provides an LDS perspective, and certainly some interesting insights to raising children in today's frightening world. My only complaint is that the editing could have used some fine-tuning. It would have made it easier to read. I read this as part of a book group, and it provided much fodder for great discussion. I believe even non-sectarian readers might benefit from parts of this book if they need or want another perspective on caring for challenging (but wonderful) children."
1,Too problem-focused,"This is just the latest of so many books that view normal adolescent development primarily from a problem perspective. Sure, there are challenges in adolescence for both teens and parents, and sometimes there are major problems to be addressed. But most adolescents, and parents, somehow manage the old and the new complexities of this period just fine. For a more positive approach, I recommend Laurence Steinberg's ""You and Your Adolescent."" Another fascinating book by Steinberg focused on school-related issues is ""Beyond the Classroom."""
3,Pretty good...but...,"This book includes lyrics, chords, melodies and, sometimes, ""signature"" licks of the songs. I've found the lyrics and chords are pretty accurate. The melodies and licks are much less accurate. This is probably because the blues does not always translate well to standard music notation (or maybe its just sloppy editing?). THerefore, this book is not recommended unless you are familiar with most of these tunes (and can, therefore, ""fake"" them more accurately)."
4,What if the Nazi's prevailed?,"What if FDR died in 1942? What if America had not been able to muster all her resources to aid the allies in defeating the German and Japanese war machines? Arthur Rhodes took me on a journey through history that is at once plausable and quite disturbing.""The Last Reich"" is a legitamate page-turner, quite honestly, much more so than I expected. The story moves quickly, the characters are defined without being cumbersome. The author's research was obviously thorough yet not over-whelmingly detailed.I found it an easy book to read, although the publisher should be embarrassed by the horrendous gaffs found through out the novel. In fact that is the very reason I deprived Mr. Rhode's a fifth star, sorry Arthur!I have heard rumors that ""The Last Reich"" may not be the final chapter of Mr. Rhodes' revised history lesson; I for one hope that this is true. I highly recommend this book and anxiously await the follow-up.Bravo, Mr Rhodes!"
4,The Last Reich,"The Last Reich is a novel with a twist on World War II. Germany wins the war but America reacts with fury and fire. Arthur Rhodes is at his best with his description of the four battles. He writes crisp and cunning plots, a complex thriller. He is not one to go into great detail, but moves the story along at footrace pace to the final battle. Older readers will recognize many of the famous names in the book, and why the Normandie Invasion failed with General Clark in command not General Eisenhower. Mr. Rhodes waves the flag a great deal and appeals to the young and young at heart. I especially was taken with the young Commander Iberson who wins the battle at the Golden Gate Bridge and the Rio Grande with his amazing feats, and courage. He is a man who can inspire Captains to carry ammunition."
2,"Good plot, very bad writing","Alternate history has to stand on a believable premise and good writing and in my opinion this book has only one leg. I found the premise believable, a German victory in WWII through poor US leadership because of the early death of Roosevelt. The writing looked like a first draft, and a bad one. I find it hard to believe even the author proofread this book, much less the editor. Often, a new paragraph will start to describe a different character in a different country with no new chapter or section or even introduction. The characters are wooden with no depth. The conversations are not believable.I give it two stars because I found the plot interesting. However, the writing was inexcusably bad."
1,Yuk!?!?!,Don't buy this book. The storyline is very inconsistant with history and it makes very invalid assumptions.
1,Don't bother buying it.,"Alright, well, I saw this Manga in my library and I thought I'd borrow it, to read it and boarden my horizans of different genres because I'm a Shonen Ai and Yaoi Fan.This book was rated 13 TEEN and let me tell you, if you think this is a cute little kiddy story it's not! Not only is it hentai, featuring a woman with basketball sized boobs, girls showing their panties in almost every shot they can get away with, there's almost no plot too. It isn't even funny, just increiably stupid.It's trully is a horrid Manga. If your a fan of Bishonen, stay away from this one! There is none and no Yaoi!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"o sure thay want u to think its about some cute alien...frog...thing!that gets housed by nice people right........ wrong!!!!thats not the story!!!!!it has horrible scenes of partial nudity!!!and scenes of them in swimsuites but not covering swim suites oh no!!well anyway, horrible magna and dont buy it for kids!!!should be older teen !!!if your looking for something for kids, buy ledgendz or hikuruno go for age groups 7-12."
2,not for farscape fans,The only thing I really liked about this book is the guest star listings in the back. The rest is dren.
3,Does Talis love Farscape?,"The book is very interesting. It offers a really good synopsis of each episode, interesting and well thought out critiques of each episode and a Tier Below section with interesting facts. It did have typos here and there, which were annoying but overall I either agreed with his critiques or thought they were at the very least, interesting reading about a show I love. Finally, as the author states in his introduction, he does love Farscape and that comes across, so I recommend this book."
5,"A sweet, inspiring read","Annette Funicello was America's sweetheart as a 12-year old and now, fifty years later, she's still loved and admired by her many fans. This autobiography details her discovery by Walt Disney and early years on the Mickey Mouse Club, her beach movies, married life, and, most recently, her battle with multiple sclerosis.It's a cheerful, modest, and inspiring story about a lady who gave up show biz for motherhood and never regretted her choice. There are lots of stories about the actors and singers she worked with over the years, chief among them her friend and co-star, Frankie Avalon.Even though her disease had already become debilitating when this was written in 1994, she maintains an overwhelmingly positive outlook and writes, ""Life does not have to be perfect to be wonderful."" Included are many professional and personal photos which brought back happy memories for me of my favorite Mouseketeer."
5,Coldwater Michingan,GREAT book about my hometown. Randall did a great job. This is a keeper book to keep in my family.
2,a very poorly written book,"Authors apparently don't know what to do with the space. This book is full of constant digressions into totally irrelevant subjects and surveys of papers published since 1960s, which have nothing to do with the MPEG standard. If the authors understood the subject, it would be interesting to hear about the colorspaces, etc., but right now the book sounds like an overview of papers and books that the authors have read. Expect 4-5 references to papers per page in chapter 4. If I wanted to read all those papers I would subscribe to IEEE. And even the summaries don't make sense most of time. In the first 70 pages it didn't seem that there was a single original explanation, chart or formula.Overall: poor writing skills, lack of demonstrable knowledge, 90% of the book is made of summaries and quotes from other places. Paper quality, not a book quality. Not worth $$$."
2,This seems like a watered down version of the official specs,"If you have read and understood the MPEG video specs, and cannot remember a few things, this may be a good reference for some key sections.This book seems to me is like a compilation of excerpts of the official specs, so it's not exactly easy to follow. I would not recommend this book as an introduction to understanding digital video or MPEG, there are books out there that explains things better."
4,MPEG-2 guys are more trustworthy than H.264 folks,"A great book to have! MPEG-2 experts like Chad always provide more real stuffs than some later folks, who might only think to be some ""chair"""
5,Loved this,I loved this movie from the first time I saw it this past Christmas. I'm really glad it's on DVD so I can buy it. I liked the story and the people who played the characters. I thought they fit into the roles they played nicely and made them seem genuine.
2,why can't romantic comedies be original?,"I saw this movie for the first time yesterday, but within a minute of watching it I knew immediately what was going to happen, when, and where. Holiday Engagement is basically every single romantic comedy cliche rolled into one. You have the breakup at the beginning, the odd encounter, hiring a guy for a family reunion, blah blah blah. Basically, it's like the Wedding Date, The Proposal, etc. If you've seen those movies, you've already seen this one."
4,Amazon delivers Holiday Engagement - we enjoy it!,"I ordered this video from Amazon for 'Family Showing' this Christmas - it arrived very quickly - the sound is very good and the picture is pleasing. Hillary Burns played by Bonnie Somerville was a delight - she runs into problems when her boyfriend can not make it for the 'Family Thanksgiving Dinner. Her Mother played by Shelley Long - is anxious to meet the boyfriend - so Hillary has a dilemma - what to do - she solves the problem - all arrive for thanksgiving and the fun begins but many things are not as they appear to be. The movie is filled with fun, laughter, a little heartbreak - plus an amusing family. This film is touching and my family loved it. We always get prompt and friendly service from Amazon - we are firm fans of Amazon. Buy this movie - it is a great Christmas addition."
2,Okay,"The movie is a bit choppy and not really smooth, but I do like the plot of the story. :) I believe that anyone that love romance movies would like this....though I have to say the kissing could have been better."
4,Little corny,I like the movie and have watched it a couple of times. Jordan Bridges is fun like he usually is but the actress is flighty (probably why her fiance left her). She lacked self-confidence.
3,not the best or worst,"Okay, so I have said it before and I will say it again, I love Christmas romance movies. I won't spend time going over the fine details of this movie. I enjoyed it, but wasn't loving it. Will keep it in our collection and will watch it again. If you are opting between this and another Christmas chic flick, then maybe opt for the other one, but if you just want to add a new movie to your collection that is good (not outstanding), then this one should be considered."
4,Like it,Treat as a comedy (of errors!!). Had a possessive mother somewhat resempling this mone - but not quite to the same extent.
4,Enjoyable,"Cute Christmas movie where the tables are turned on the present boyfriend who doesn't have time for the girl he ""loves"" (?)."
2,Dome Head,"This isn't horrible (I've seen worse), but I returned it. The cap's dome is very tall-- higher than the pictured depiction. It's not terribly low profile, at least in the sense of the dome's profile. The color and materials were acceptable (made in China).Instead, I decided to go for theCondor Tactical Cap, Olive Draband cut off the patches (pulled off nicely at the stitches inside). Result was a low profile olive drab hat (my intention with this item) for roughly the same price."
4,Well-Written But Graphic,"As the other reviewers have stated, this novel (which bears little resemblance to the movie) is not for the kiddies. I found the dinosaur scenes effectively written but too graphically violent for my taste, but at least that sort of violence (hey, it's dinosaurs!) is understandable. Unfortunately, the more nauseating aspect of the novel is the unlikable, sexually and ethically repulsive humans that are the main characters. Oh well, just as well, I suppose, since many of them are destined to be disemboweled or eaten alive by the end of the book..."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Think Jurassic Park, with a bit less science, and a bit more aggressive chomping up of people. It is called Carnosaur after all, and there is certainly enough carnivorous carnage to be had here.A group of not too nice people decide to breed themselves some dinosaurs with the old use other bits of closely related animals trick.Long pig walking."
1,I was shocked!,"Shocked, but not by the dinosaurs. You don't have to read too far into this one to get to some pretty explicit .... Darn. I was looking for a dino adventure but found something of a much more adult nature than I expected. Folks, don't buy this one for your kids. I wish I could say the dinos were a redeeming feature, but the raptor is too reptilian to reflect the modern scientific knowledge that they were feathered and very birdlike. For some reason, I kept wishing I was reading either a classic like Doyle's Lost World, where even though the dinos are depicted as sluggish, giant lizards, at least the humans weren't so lascivious. Or, for a thoroughly modern view of dinos AND people who comport themselves decently, try Dinosaur Wars by Hopp. The latter has up-to-date, birdlike dinos and a romance that is clean-cut enough to be read by preteens and their parents alike."
5,"Edward C. Mann, author of ""Shadow Wind""","""Get Published"" has a wealth of information, and is extremely motivational! I found the promotional sections invaluable."
1,Not too impressed at all,"I found this book a great disappointment after reading the delightful ""Pointers from Nisargadatta Maharaj"" by Ramesh Balsekar. I expected it to be a tribute, but is about 80% dialogues from his own Teachings (Wolinski says... or Stephen says ....). And then add the "" Quantum Psychology"" that the author has developed. It seemed to be to be more a tribute to Wolinski, rather than to the amazing and incredible Nisargatta Maharaj. Buy ""Pointers"" by Balsekar instead"
4,Great quotes.. and a nice personal tribute.,"Excellent quotation choice here, with Nisargadatta's usual punchy one-liners. Also contains some excellent personal coverage of the author's time with the sage. However, the ""Quantum Psychology"" pieces are confusing more than anything, and didn't seem to add much to the book or for an understanding Nisargadatta's teaching. The author has a tendency to also over-analyze and expound on Nisargadatta's teachings, which can end up complicating the whole matter. Worth a read or an addition to your Advaita library however."
2,"Operative word is ""mini"".","The compass works well but if you mount it on the dashboard you might need binoculars to read it. The picture on the website is quite misleading, as it is approximately twice as large as the actual product. It would have been useful to have the actual dimensions of the product included in the description. The compass ball is barely one inch in diameter, and the suction cup raises it a whopping 1/2 inch up in the air. The shipping rate of just under six dollars is another example of a hidden price. Save yourself six bucks and look for this item in a dollar store near you."
1,Not worth your money,"Maybe mine was faulty, but the compass does not point North nor to anyother cardinal point for the matter. It simply ""sticks"" to the outersurface and does not turn freely.My next compass just got USD 5.50 more expensive.Consider buying another compass."
4,A well researched story.,"An outstanding telling of the infamous Kimes Gang saga.Also crammed with much information concerning nearly all the roving gangs of Oklahoma bank bandits of the day.If one has an interest in 1920s bank robbers and the lawmen who pursued them, this lengthy informitive narritive neatly fills the void... R.D.Morgan, Author of ""The Tri-State Terror: The Life and Crimes of Wilbur Underhill."""
4,Exceptional Work on a Southwest Outlaw Gang,"I recently picked up a copy of ""The Kimes Gang"" by Koch and found it to be a truely different kind of a true crime book. The main bandmen are from Arkansas, and by the mid-1920s they possibly may have become the worst group of outlaws to hit the southwest. They robbed two banks on the same day, twice, WOW!!! Unfortuneately, the gang was also responsible for the deaths of at least two law enforcement officers in Oklahoma, and possibly one in Texas. The author explores all the gangs activities and braches out to other criminal elements of the 1920s. I would higly recommned it to any true crime readers."
2,Shocking,This book is riddled with errors. Dates and names are wrong with many names misspelled. Just because someone uses footnotes and endnotes doesn't mean that his sources are correct. Mr. Koch should have doubled checked his sources before printing fact. I thought he would have done better than this.
5,The Kimes Gang,"Oklahoma has a fascinating history, particularly with regard to law enforcement. Well into the early part of the last century, the lawlessness of the pre-statehood days often prevailed, with many gangs of dangerous criminals finding Oklahoma a haven for their lawless activities. Mike Koch examines in great detail one such group of outlaws, the infamous Kimes brothers, whose criminal resumes are most impressive. Koch has presented a thorough account which appears to be meticulously researched. This book as well places the Kimes brothers in the general context of the times, and should appeal to readers wishing to know more about Depression era life."
5,Reviewer,"This is the first book written on this subject matter that I am aware of. It is filled with information on this outlaw gang from Oklahoma during the 1920s, which included Matt & George Kimes, some of his family member, Ray Terrill and others. It is well researched and documented. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about a forgotten gang of bandits."
1,Lab series and Dermalogica are much better,"It really doesnt feel like a real scrub.. where are them? It feels like a regular face cleanser not a scrub! Also I hate the fact that has fragrance! Pro products come with no fragrance just check lab series or dermalogica, this products really work."
5,work like a dream,"there is not a better scrub than this one. the difference can be felt right away, and it leaves the skin soft and smooth."
5,Great product,This product is way superior to other exfoliator on the market. It leaves your skin clean and smooth. This is a great product for a small price. I love it!!
1,THE WORST QUALITY I'VE EVER SEEN,"on the image it appears to be a beautiful set, however once you take it in your hands it is absolutely the worst. The knifes arrived dull. The handles have holes in them, especially the steak knifes. The gold trim is not gold but rusted. Very disappointed..."
2,Made in China - need I say more?,"Cheap quality - looks good from afar, but nothing you would want to display in your kitchen or chop tomatoes or bell peppers with!"
4,Excellent pop influenced jazz,I bought this album while stationed in England in the 80s. Its an excellent mix of smooth pop and light jazz. The songs are very strong and are performed flawlessly. Very similar in writing quality to the early Alan Parson albums like Eve.For those that like the style this is an excellent album in its place. All the songs show off Lees talent as a guitarist without making the guitar all the song is about. That said it doesnt ignore the guitar work either. Great album.
2,Behind the Mask a disappointment,"When reading about this video I was lead to believe it would delve a little deeper than other ""catching"" videos. My son is 11 and learned almost nothing from it. There are no drills to enforce the skills that a catcher needs to have. I feel ""Play Ball the Major League Way""-(Pitching and Catching) does a much better job. (And it's cheaper too!!) At [price] ""D&D"" is a ""Major League"" rip off."
4,"SH--8 invader pickup, neck","This pickup is amazing! Warm tone and color, perfect for sweeps and solos in my opinion great for a lead guitarist who loves passive pickups."
3,who knew sex could be this boring?,"Early Embraces III is sweet all the way through. If you haven't yet had your first experience with a woman, you may appreciate this book. However, the sweetness becomes tedious after awhile, and all the stories have the same flavor- very, very, vanilla. If you're looking for more variety, try Penthouse. These stories make lesbian sex sound dull.:"
5,A great counting book!!,"As a Kindergarten teacher, this book is one of the BEST for practicing counting with pre-schoolers and Kindergarteners. It has large pictures and numbers making it easier for little readers to find and count each object, much less frustrating than the I Spy or Where's Wally seach and find books. This makes a wonderful book for parents and children to share. When I found it in our school library, I ordered this one and others for my classroom. We've all found it lots of fun. Enjoy!"
3,coffee filters,"THIS WAS A GOOD BUY. CAME FAST. HOWEVER, HALF WAY THROUGH EACH BUNDLE OF FILTERS THEY ARE CUT WRONG CAUSING YOU TO THROW THEM AWAY. THE PRICE IS RIGHT YOU JUST HAVE A NUISCANCE OF MAKING SURE THE FILTERS ARE WHOLE AND NOT CUT WRONG OR WADDED UP."
5,Coffee Supreme!,I ordered the 12-cup regular filters after being tired of drinking grounds in our office coffee daily because we were using a smaller filter. The filters arrived earlier than expected and everyone in the office commented how quickly it took. The filters are working perfectly and we are all experiencing a great cup of mojo these days! Thanks for fast delivery. We'll definitely order again when supply begins to run low!!
1,Sad,"I was so disappointed in this tea. Bought it with the assumption that an Irish blend would be bold and with lots of flavor. Completely opposite. I normally don't buy products that do not have reviews, but I took a chance on this one. I see another reviewer felt the same way. Sorry, Choice, wanted to love you, but this was a big fail."
5,Kindle version,This is good and easy book to use. I wish the kindle version included page numbers as it would be helpful when my class references specific things in the text.
5,'Evaluation in Organizations: A Systematic Approach to Enhancing Learning,I used this book for a graduate level class. It is very concise and easy to read. The authors are very good at presenting material and ideas.
3,Evaluation handbook,"This book was used as the principal text in a graduate management course. It offers a good overview of the evaluation process and a step by step process to either evaluate your organization, or create an evaluation process."
1,This book is no good,"I used this book as the textbook for my course at Loyola Univ. (Chicago). It is as bad as other books written by consultants. The professional habit of consultants is to make easy problems hard, while professors' habit is to make hard problem easy. This book uses many unnecessary classifications to inflate pages, shows many incorrect approaches before finally gives the right answer. These can really make students confused. I sold the book as soon as the semester is over.Xiaolong Wu"
3,Better than other Carmine videos,"This one was a little better, but seemed mostly directed at Carmine, rather than instruction."
3,Disappointed!!!,"Ok. im sorry to say this but this book was bland. i guess i expected some spice but instead i only received a not so tangy read. even though georgia had the spice but she didnt carried it out...i think jess had that and more but she wasnt the main character. not saying that georgia should had cheated on her husband but come on now...add some spice to the imagination...i wanted to read about michael's and georgia's thoughts...how michael was making love to georgia in his mind...it would have been a great book if the author would have added some passion, enthusiasm, and/ or some type of emotion...lust, desire, love, hate, etc. in the book."
5,"A refreshing, not-run-of-the-mill, titillating story!","My mother-in-law, the author, sent it to me and asked for my truthful opinion -- so here it is! I loved this book. I don't normally read romance novels, but when I started this book, I just couldn't put it down!The main characters Georgia Manning and Michael Dellacruz were both likeable and attractive. I could certainly relate to Georgia and her infatuation with Michael, in spite of a happy marriage. And a younger man, too! Talk about electricity! I could feel the excitement and the spark between Georgia and Michael throughout the book -- even though the author didn't spend a lot of time in graphic detail. That is quite a feat, and a sign of real, in-depth character development by this new author.I can't wait for the next Geri Spencer Hunter novel to burst onto the virtual bookshelves! I will be recommending this book to my two bookclubs. I can't wait to hear what my friends have to say!Continued future success to the author!"
3,Interesting peek into photojournalism,"The video was an interesting look into what really goes into making those amazing NatGeo photographs. However, there is some propaganda here: showing the courage and dedication of the photographers as they brave difficulties so that you and I can enjoy fascinating photographs, blah blah blah. And the photo technology is out of date. However, it does provide a glimpse into the lives of globe trotting photojournalists and can help the viewer understand the reality of what it takes to be a NatGeo photographer. Personally, I enjoyed the video, despite it's flaws."
1,Do not purchase,"These books relies entirely on the use of aversives (collar choking) with dog training and does not use strong positive reinforcers like food. The methods are 50 years outdated and did not work at all with my dog. If you really want to know how your dog learns and how to teach him what you want him to do, buy Jean Donaldson's Culture Clash, perhaps the best book ever written about dogs."
3,Good General Info - Too cursory on breeds!,"We own a 95% basenji, so naturally we turned to the ""expanded"" breed entries. It was barely a full page, and some information was just plain wrong!The authors say ""its OK to leave your basenji alone for long periods because its not a 'nervous' breed"". No mention was made of crating which is essential for this breed if they are left alone. Basenjis are also very pack-oriented and will be very unhappy if left without human or canine companionship for very long. I didn't expect the authors to include every relevant fact about a specific breed; but I did expect them to get what they did include right!If you own a basenji, or are thinking of owning one, or another other purebred, I strongly recommend purchasing a book specific to your breed. This one will very likely shortchange your breed, and should not be used as a sole authority."
4,common sense dog training,"This is the second time I purchased this book. I had it years ago and came upon it agian accidentally. I bought it again as it is easy to follow and has practical, humane training tips."
1,Ripped off,Gotnan old non revised beat up addition. Absolutely no help. I wanted revised addition? I did not see this was not the revised addition. Had picture of revised addition. I got an ancient brown cover
5,Just In The Nick of Time,"Thank goodness I got this book when I did! We bought it because we just got a new addition to our family that will live inside with my wife and myself - a blue standard poodle named Pepper. Surely, without having read this and modifying our behavior, this puppy would have thought his name was ""no"" instead of Pepper. My wife would also have remained subordinate to Pepper in our ""pack."" It is packed with such good information for dog owners who want a well-behaved dog. It would pay anyone even planning to get a new puppy to read this book ""prior to"" the aquisition as it contains valuable behavioral information on 100 different breeds the authors have had first hand experience with in training. Even if you plan to teach your dog (old or new) just a few of the basic commands, there are right and wrong ways to do even that. A must read for folks who care about dogs!"
3,Out dated methods,"There is some basic good information in this book, but there are many out dated methods also. I like using positive techniques and this book suggests otherwise for some dogs. It also fails to mention many more of the techniques that we are using today. I would not recommend this book unless you have more background knowledge in dog training and can tell the good from the bad."
2,"Good Dog, Bad Dog: Dog Training Made Easy","Informative and witty, but the substance of training gets lost in all the excess verbiage, making it difficult to zero in on specific training. Actual training instructions are hazy and undiliniated from text."
4,Time to Visit Italy Again,"My wife thought that the guys would think I was reading a romance novel, but for a dad of 4 daughters it was much more than I imagined. Karin developed some very strong characters and put them into some very unique situations. I read the book in 2 days, but the story and the characters stuck with me for 2 weeks. I still can't shake Paulo. This is a great book to read on the plane back from the Winter Olympics in Italy or on your way to Italy this Spring."
4,Winsome Wood End Table,"Nice product, shipped fast, easy to assemble. Sturdy table and the drawer moves in and out easily. Purchased two, one for each side of the bed. They look great and are a good height."
3,you get what you pay for,"Received 2 end tables. They are generally nice-looking once assembled. However, both had dented /cracked rear right table top corners. Not noticeable enough to go through the hassle of returning. Drawers are cheaply constructed, but will not be used to hold anything of value. Average product for the cheap price."
4,Attractive end table/nightstand for the money.,"We bought two of these, and were very happy with the quality, and ease of assembly. This is not high end furniture with dove-tailed drawers and such. But the simple beauty of the design is exceptional in this price range. I will be looking to purchase a couple of more pieces in this Winsome Wood 'Timber' line. As usual, purchasing from Amazon was a professional, and well run transaction."
2,Bad Quality,"Received the 2 tables I ordered and both tops had finish issues There were holes in wood that were poorly filled and the finish was spotty. I called the manufacturer (Winsome) and they would not send 2 replacement tops, only one. I received the replacement and it was just as bad as the first 2. I was not at all impressed and would not order anything from this company again."
2,"Looks good, for a minute.","I thought these tables would be perfect for our family room. They look good, they were super easy to assemble, however, they scratch so easy that even dusting will leave scratches. I expect they will look terrible in a very short time. Don't waste your money."
4,Good Product,"Received my 2 end tables on-time and in good condition. They are easy to put together and look pretty nice considering the price. I'm also ordering the matching coffee table. If it's as good as the end tables, I'll be very pleased."
2,WINSOME END TABLE,PROMPT ATTENTION TO ORDER & TIMELY DELIVERY WAS GOODONE TABLE HAD A NOTICEABLE BLEMISH ON TOP BUT SINCE IT WOULD BE COVERED BY A LAMP IT WASN'T WORTH THE EFFORT OF RETURNING BUT I'M SURE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED.TABLES ARE NOT HIGH QUALITY BUT ACCEPTABLE FOR THE PRICE
4,winsome wood end table is real wood !,I could not wait to open the box for the new table. The corner of the box was damaged. The table top was damaged on the back corner. about the size of a quarter. My husband got out his carpentry skills and did the best he could to repair it. This is a shipping issue. Other wise I would order from this company again. We have been way to busy to stop and make a call on the damage.
