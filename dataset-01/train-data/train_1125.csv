5,TWO TOWERS IS GOING TO WIN AN OSCAR!!!,"wow, wow, wow, wow.....that's all i can sem to say about seeing the fellowship of the ring, and seeing the trailer for the first time in the movie theatres...being a LOTR fanatic, i don't know if i'll ever be able to be patient enought for the 2 towers to come out!!! WOW!! i was quite dissapointed that this movie did not win the oscars ofr best supporting actor( Ian Mckellen) or best picture. it was a good enought movie to win all thirteen nominations!!...two towers or return of the king is definetly gonna win...this is (in my opinion) the best book ever written, and if you agree with me, well, you know what i mean.....anyway, i encourage you all to get your two towers tickets soon, cuz when december comes, they're gonna be selling like hotcakes!!!"
1,The Two Towers Disappoints,"Unfortunately this movie discards the story line of the Two Towers halfway through the movie. Along with the incorrect emphasis on the battle of Helm's Deep, the interaction between Frodo and Faramir is absolutely incorrect. I don't understand why the tale was so corrupted by this film. I dread the release of The Return of The King because who knows how the wonderful original Tale will be corrupted like it was in the Two Towers. The Fellowship of the Ring did a decent job (although it had its flaws) but it's nothing as flagrant as the disaster of the Two Towers."
2,Disappointed,"Yes, I'm not rating this film high, or Fellowship. I found out only recently about the extended versions. I only saw them in theaters and thought they were awful films. After watching the extended version of Fellowship, I grew to like that one more, but haven't seen the ext. version of The Two Towers, a film I hated in theaters. Call me crazy for writing a review. I felt cheated. If they're so good and so popular, why didn't the studio release the extended versions for a couple of weeks in a handful of theaters? Shame on them. The Audience IS WATCHING!"
5,So much better & more fun than the first,"I love this film so much and the Extended Edition does not disappoint. Great interviews with Christopher Lee and Viggo Mortensen on the 'History of Middle Earth' featurette as well as the creation of Gollem. LOOK'S LIKE MEAT IS BACK ON THE MENU, BOYS!"
5,Don't Waste Your Money On The Origional Version!!!,The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Special Extended DVD Edition will be a whole lot better than the theatrical version. Why waste your money on the origional version of The Two Towers wnen there is the Special Extended DVD Edition of it that is coming out on store shelves soon? I can't wait to own it on the 18nth!
5,The Best DVD This Year,"I had to buy this movie as soon as it came out. Besides the film being one of the greatest movies ever made, the special features help to complete the package. You have to buy this DVD to see the footage about The Return of the King!!!!!!"
3,ENOUGH ALREADY,"Story - PREFECTActing - SuperbBUT ENOUGH WITH THE SCENIC VIEWS, IF YOU CUT OUT THE PANORAMIC VIEWS OF MIDDLE EARTH, THE EXTENDED MOMENTS OF SILENCE SCANNING THE COUNTRY SIDE YOU COULD PROBABLY SHAVE A HOUR OFF THE RUNNING TIME"
3,very good like always,"i am a fan of lotr so i likes this movie.the actors are very good particularly Elijah Wood.The movie is very different of the book, but it doesn?'t matter, there is the same idea.the landscape are beautiful and the special effect are extraordinaire.Watch the extented version!!"
1,"""I liked white better...""","The two most painful movie-watching experiances I've had were sitting through Jackson's first two adaptations of the trilogy. It's rather sad that Bakashi, with half the screen time to work with, was able to be more faithful in adapting JRRT's plot and dialogue for FotR. Yet as horrific as Jackson's first movie was, his second was a crime against the soul of the book.It's a shame that generations of people will be getting their first view of JRRT's work through Jackson's adaptations rather than the books and JRRT's own vision and words.John"
5,Five Stars And Two Thumbs Up!,"This is a movie that is NOT to be missed by anyone! ""Lord of the Rings: Two Towers"" is a great movie that I highly recommend you buy for DVD. This movie is brilliant with great music (score), wonderful acting, and incredible visual effects! Sequel to the great ""Fellowship of the Ring"" ""Two Towers"" is a great action/adventure movie title that even the most critical audience will enjoy!"
5,"An incredible film, except of course you're a ""purist""","I don't normally review many items but I do feel the need to take a moment to say how great the Two Towers was. It is a given fact that it did stray from the book at times, but as any film maker knows, when you make an adaption of a series you must make a few sacrifices in order to aid those who maybe gave not read the series. I was happy despite the changes that were made. I think peter jackson did an incredible job adapting a very thick novel into and understandable and enjoyable series of films...."
2,Disappointment,"I really wanted to like this movie. I love the first one, and I love the books. But one of the reasons the first movie was so good was because it followed the book so well, while still eliminating unnecessary parts and with few additions. It's hard to believe the second and first movies were made at the same time. Two Towers has pretty much the whole story rewritten! And the saying, ""If it's not broken don't fix it"" holds true. the movie becomes boring, with repetitive and pointless action sequences that were apparently added for the purpose of making it more engaging. Peter Jackson really likes the fake death sequences, unfortunately who can only have so many of those without destroying the fantasy created for the audience. I just hope Return of the King gets justice."
2,Call it something by another name!,"To edit a book in order to make it into a movie such as 'The Fellowship of the Ring' did, is very common place and acceptable. After all squeezing an epic reading experience into 2 hours is impossible. On the other hand what happened in 'The Two Towers'(?) is like splatting some paint onto a canvas and passing it off as a Picasso. To alter the inherent nature of a main character is a crime against the book, and no longer worthy of it's title. Peter Jackson could just as well have started from scratch and made a great movie, but let's face it, he wanted to cash in on a much loved classic, not honor it."
3,What is the appeal?,"I have watched the first one, and much of the second one. I really wanted to like it because it is so respected. But I really don't get the appeal. Sure, the effects are great. But the story and the dialogue are as interesting as watching grass grow. If you know you are a fantasy or a Tolkien fan, go for it. Otherwise..."
5,Critics: Heal Thy Selves,"As an artist of various mediums, myself, I watch The Lord of the Rings and my critical analysis runs like this: Compared to the accomplishment this film project represents, I feel like I can't skip and chew gum at the same time. And if I live a thousand years, I may never create the likes of this work by Jackson and his friends. My considered advise to detractors of the film: Take a look at the sum of all your contributions to art, and if you still feel you qualify to comment, then by all means go for it. In that case we may elect to be drug down by your disappointment. Otherwise, as they say, better keep your day jobs."
1,Even a sale doesn't interest me. EXTENDED OR NOTHING!,"When I saw the current sale today of each of the LOTR titles on Blu Ray I still didn't even think about it.Until the Extended Releases are available on Blu, Warner / New Line is not getting my money on LOTR. My wife and I have already purchased both the theatrical and extended DVDs, we're not getting double dipped again."
3,this is for the blu-ray 2010,"lord of the rings is at the top 10 on my list of movies i liked than any other movies i seen. i purchased my blu-ray copy at wal-mart, not amazon.com. cheaper here. i did'nt think the blu-ray was that sharp in distant shots of the film and the black color scenes looked saturated in some places. the blu-ray colors match the hi-def standard but looks like my regular editions on standard tv. i rather have all 3 lords of the ring in pristine and sharp condition like the matrix."
4,"wow, just wow.","This was an awesome mopvie. It's sooo long, but at least I'm getting my moneys worth. The 2 Towers was an awesome movie and a must have.The only thing I didnt like was that how it was too long ago. lol."
4,Almost as good as Fellowship,"Another great movie based on the Tolkein books! This one is action, action, action! The plot moves a bit slower than the first, and deviated more from the book, but it was still excellent and well worth seeing. I realize that writers and directors cannot be fully faithful to the books but I have to bones to pick. First, why is Faramir of a totally different character in the movie than in the film? He is supposed to be nothing like Boramir. Second, I realize they wanted to make good use of Liv Tyler, but some of the stuff with her in it is condradictory to the books. Anyway, this one is not quite as great as Fellowship, but still very good. Gollum was so life-like and true to character, he really made the movie for me. I also greatly enjoyed the Dead Marshes. I can't wait to see the expanded edition!!!I actually would give this 4.5 stars."
1,Has to be the worst movie ever!!!,"This movie was SOOOOOOO Not worth buying, seeing, or renting!!!The only reason I gave it one star was for the special effects. They were very well done! But the movie itself is so far off from the books that I am in doubt as to whether I will even see the third one even at a $1.00 theater! I know that film makers can't follow the book exactly but they could have at least gotten a few things right. In the book when Frodo and Sam were caught by the men from Gondor they were released from there. They never went with them anywhere else. What is this malarkey about going to see Boromir's father? And what's this about having to trick the Ents into going to war? Yes they debated for several days in the book, but never had to be tricked.All in all a complete waste of time. If you really have to see this movie, go rent it from your local grocery store where you can get it for $1.00 for 5 days. I wouldn't spend any more than that."
5,Twice as better as the Fellowship special addition,"love seeing Denethor before I get to see him in the third one. Faramir's extra footage is great, and love the comedic scenes in this film. it tops the special addition of The Fellowship Of The Ring."
5,Collector's Gift Set,"This collector's edition gift set of ""The Two Towers"" will be similar in quality to the gift set produced for ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" It will include the 4 disc Platinum series extended DVD (anamorphic widescreen with DTS, four commentaries, and hours of other extras), a collectible sculpture of Gollum from Weta/Sideshow, and a special bonus 5th DVD from Weta focusing entirely on the development and creation of CGI Gollum for the film. This all comes in special packaging featuring the artwork of Alan Lee."
5,The lord of the rings,"A must buy movie! Great for everyone! The good thing about the ""Two Towers."" The good thing is there really is no blood at all. So anyone could watch it. I can't wait for it to come out on dvd and video! There are some scary monsters in it though, but everyone should know that! I will give it 5/5!"
5,The Lord of the Rings; The Two Towers (special edition),"Great movie - great characters - great acting - wonderful special effects - and it even manages funny moments in the midst of parts favorite characters could die any moment. And that is hard to do without making it seem silly, but they've done it here.And the Special Edition is worth the extra money. It includes deletes scenes, extra commentaries, and much more then the normal version of the DVD.Recommended for everyone."
2,Not True Animorphic Widescreen !,"I picked up the movie on the day of release. This is NOT a true animorphic transfer. Normally you would expand (or your TV would) a DVD signal horizontally to pop the image into 16:9.HOWEVER, this version of LOTR 2 Towers requires that you, or your TV, expand the image horizontally, and then again vertically. This is basically a cheap way for New Line to fit the whole movie on one DVD. Buyer Beware ! Wait for the 2 DVD version for a true animorphic transfer."
3,Beware! An extended edition will be out in November,"Last year I bought the first episode DVD when it was released in last August, only to beoff when they released an extended edition in November for just a couple bucks more. Amazon says that the extended edition of this movie episode will also be out Nov. 18, 2003 (and you can even preorder it) so don't be suckered into buying both. Wait until November and buy the extended edition.Best Wishes"
5,Awesome Spectacular of Modern Cinemascope,"I agree with the reviewer from Salt Lake City, Utah. Although I was not a ""purist"" before seeing the any of the ""Rings"" movies, I believe this may have given myself an advantage in not allowing myself to be judgemental & biased towards the books or the movies. Everyone knows that 99.9% of the time the movie is never identical to the book, that is of course unless one lives in a vaccumn? Heck even the famous ""Anne Rice"" was commissioned by the studio who made ""Interview"" to write the screenplay for the movie, and she wasn't a 100% faithful to the book! So with that in mind, it's funny to me that people exhaust their energies trying to get everyone else to buy into their beliefs. It's a movie for Christ sake! Enjoy it for what it is, and stop making into someting it isn't"
5,Absolutely fabulous,"When I went to see this movie, I was skeptical, being not a big fan of the first Lord of the Rings installment and never having read the books, however, I was pleasantly surprised. Actually, that's an understatement. I was blown away by the action, the acting, and most of all, the amount of effort everyone working on the movie had put into it. The battle of Helms Deep is spectacular, the cast is great (especially the intensely sexy Viggo Mortensen), but the animation is amazing. Gollum is just wonderful, he's my favourite character, and the ents are quite good. I can't say enough complimentary things about this movie, it's just something you have to see for yourself. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see something mind-blowingly exciting but not too intense."
5,Why can't more DVDs be like this one?,Too many studios are taking short cuts and not giving the fans what they really want-- extra features. This disc is packed with hours of commentary and making-of featurettes. Any fan of the series owes it to himself/herself to check it out!
4,Spectacular action and extreme boredom.,"The first of the series LOTR's was a slightly better than average movie, but an excellent adaption of the books. This trilogy actually gets better as it goes along. Once I had both enjoyed and suffered through LOTR I, I was able to savor most of TWIN TOWERS, but there were parts that just made me want to take a nap. I am not a fan of extremely long camera shots of facial expressions, especially given the limited range of expressions emotted by some of the hobbits in particular. Liv tyler also only had one facial expression, her grim poker face. I give LOTRF 4 stars and RETURN OF THE KING 5 stars. The special effects and the masterful battle sceens are an absolute WOW!This is the best trilogy since Star Wars, and due to the evolution of cinematography, is aguably now the best trilogy in existance."
5,Each successive one becomes my favorite....,"How could they have topped ""Fellowship of the Rings?"" The casting, scenery, music has become so entangled with the book that they're virtually inseparable. Plus, this addition gives us 43 minutes enhancements to tell more of the story and the characterization. I love getting lost in Tolkien's world for 3 hours or more."
3,TOLKIEN HAS PROBABLY TURNED OVER IN HIS GRAVE.....,"Peter Jackson has done some wonderful things with his making of ""Fellowship of the Ring"" amd some disgraceful things with the""Two Towers"".I understand not being able to have everything in the movie that is in the books. BUT, I feel rewriting parts of a masterpiece isunforgivable. The escape to and from The Prancing Pony should nothave been touched, the ride to Rivendale should have been as in the book. (TheExtended Version is much better.)In the Two Towers it was unforgiveable for Jackson to have re-written the Chapters 4,5, and 6 of Book 4. He presents Faramirfalsely and destroys what Tolkien was trying to relate-that therewere some honorable men who would help Frodo and not try and steal the Ring. The movie would have been so much better if Jackson had just followed the books.Jackson's creation of Gollum and Treebeard was magnificent and hehe did a wonderful job with them.The movie is worth haveing all the same.."
5,A worthy continuation of an epic saga.,"At the end of the first, the Fellowship split up. So it will switch characters from time to time. You will see Frodo and Sam's encounter with the ""precious"" creature, Gollum, their journey to Mt. Doom, Pippin and Merry escaping from the Orcs and finding Treebeard, and many other things. Better than the first, with more, action, humor, and story. Plus, Gandalf makes a grand return."
5,Adding This To Cart Is A No Brainer....,"4 discs including 43 minutes of additional footage all in a cool collector's box for around $25. You can read all the long winded 500 word reviews you want to, but you're just wasting your own time. You know you want this so just go ahead and buy it!You will not be sorry."
5,Awaiting For It To Be Released On DVD,"I loved this movie when I first saw it in theaters. It was just plain awsome and full of amazement! Now I cannot wait to buy both the Theatrical Edition and the Special Extended DVD Edition of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" when they are released in stores. I bought both the Theatrical Edition and the Special Extended DVD Edition of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"", ""The Two Towers"" brilliant prequel, and I loved both of the editions. Now I know that ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" Theatrical Edition and the Special Extended DVD Edition will be magnificent!"
5,Lord of the Rings,"I am writing this because I really enjoyed the movie, but I also want to praise amazon because I bought this product 3 days before Christmas as a present for my husband and it was delivered on the 24th, I was very impressed. I would recommend the movie and as always Amazon to all my friends and family."
1,triple dip for what reason?,"This is an awful attempt at nothing but to try and squeeze more money from fans who just flock to the words ""limited edition"". Save your money. There is no reason to buy these. At all. No DTS, no commentaries. Capitalism at it finest."
3,"I think the director liked, but didn't love, The Two Towers","When I went to see ""Fellowship of the Ring"" in the movie theater, I was absolutely speechless at the end of it. I was so relieved, so encouraged by Jackson's interpretation of the novel I was beyond words. But beyond that, I got the feeling that the people who made ""Fellowship"" really loved the story - a sense that they'd taken great care in filming it.I do get that feeling at times while watching ""The Two Towers"", like during parts of the battle at Helm's Deep, but the rest of the film seems like ""Tolkien Lite"". The sets and visuals were top-notch, but there was entirely too much cheezy dialogue that stood out painfully from the original source material.It's not a bad movie, per se, but it's not as good as its predecessor, and it lacks the care and sensitivity that made ""Fellowship"" great."
5,The Two Towers,"Outstanding adaptation of the book!!! This movie from Peter Jackson is the most closest to the original book!!! Excellent service from Amazon, as usual!"
5,The Lord of The Rings Review The Two Towers,I loved the Lord of the Rings set. The Two Towers was my favorite because it had the most action and seemly the best special effects.
5,Sam Cable is not a true LOTR fan.....,"...pay him no mind, he is a simpleton who cannot comprehend the greatness of this theatrical translation of one of the greatest fantasy stories of all time, and make no mistake about it, Peter Jackson has made the legendary words of Tolkien into a legendary visual and virtually amazing trilogy that will live on in cinematic greatness for years to come...."
2,Tin ring.,"The good points? Gollum is fantastic, probably the best-realized character in this movie version of the Trilogy(so far). The scenery and settings, both digital and real, are incredible; you DO feel like you're in Middle Earth.The bad points? Everything else! Why, why, WHY did Peter Jackson and his co-writers feel a need to ""improve"" upon the original material with new plot devices that manage to spoil the suspense and dialogue that makes George Lucas' STAR WARS scripts read like, well, J.R.R. Tolkien by comparison? The only thing I was left with at the end of THE TWO TOWERS was a sense of dread, scared stiff by the thought of how Jackson's going to mangle THE RETURN OF THE KING!I don't care a bit if my opinion is in the minority: based upon what's been released so far, the only thing that could have been worse than this version of THE LORD OF THE RINGS is if Walt Disney Studios had tried doing it instead."
3,Does anyone have this Special Extended Edition? - No!,I wonder how many reviews were written about this Special Edition. It will be released on 18th of november?! If you want to rate the movie you can do it somewhere else.
3,Hemming and Hawing - writ large,"I really enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring - moreso on DVD than in the theater. But The Two Towers - snoresville. There was about a half-hour worth of plot, and then two hours of filler. The subplot with the walking trees was excruciating. So many critics fell all over themselves to rave about this movie - but it left me totally and utterly bored. I wish it had been as good as the first, but it wasn't. The characters hemmed and hawed and talked and chatted and wheezed and voiced pretentious, pointless dialogue for way too long. As a fan who liked the first moviejust fine and doesn't want to bash the series, let's hope Return of the King is a rousing finish to the trilogy."
5,Two Towers- How (Helm's) deep is your love? ( for lotr),The fellowship was superb.To all the pods that had something to say about the ending I got one word for you: TRILOGY.The Towers will be even better as story progresses and the rythem really picks up.Anyone who critisizes the movies can try and imagine of how he would make this one better- NOT!I watched the fellowship on Christmas day 2001 at Denver Colorado-it was a beautiful day and a great movie!Michael the bearer of one of the seven rings.
1,What does this have to do with Tolkien?,"This movie has almost nothing to do with the story in Tolkien's legendary books. Peter Jackson has basically written his own story and called it The Two Towers to sell more tickets. In The Fellowship he at least tried to stick somewhat close to the book and even though there where some gross inaccuracies I thought he did a pretty good job. This movie however is a joke. It does not deserve to bear the name The Two Towers. Peter Jackson basically decided to say ""Forget the book I can write it better"" (actually that is pretty much what he did say in an interview with Time magazine) but in my opnion he was wrong!The characters for the most part were well casted and the actors do a good job. Also, the sets looked good. That however is all that can be said for this film. Otherwise, this movie was an insult to Tolkien and his books."
2,Two Towers?,"This movie was good, but I didn't get the Two Towers part, at all. I mean, the WTC barely entered into it, except as a giant allegory, and I still can't figure out if Sauron the All Seeing no one ever saw was really Osama no one can find or the CIA thought police. as a 9/11 film, it sucks."
5,INCREDIBLE movie,"Peolpe keep on saying that this movie did not include everything from the book...true, but I would like to see them do better than Peter Jackson has done! Fitting everything from the book into one film would be extremely hard without upsetting the audience because of the long running time. Hopefully the true LOTR fans will get back scenes that were not in the movie from the special edition DVD, and will be satisfied. This movie will go down as one of the greatest trilogies of all time! I hope Peter Jackson gets an Oscar for all this..."
4,Good movie but...,"I love the Lord of the Rings and I found the second movie to be thrilling. It has lots of action:P new characters and is totally gripping. The only thing I dislike is that the movie itself does not follow the storyline very well. It left out some(what i thought) important parts. The producers also added some things that make the movie seem very distant and romantic. I do not crititize their decision as obviosly they thought it was best, but I do wish they had followed the storyline of Tolkien's book better. Other than this it is an excellent movie and I really reccomend it!!!"
4,Problems with DTS sound track?,"Great Entended Edition, Let down by occassionl drop-outs/skips on the DTS soundtrack - nothing too noticable but annoying none the less. Dolby Digital was fine.Anyone else have this issue with this DVD set?"
5,Watch brilliant commenators like Colin Duriez on this DVD,"This is GREAT folks! Not only are all the extra scenes fully incorporated into the movie, making it even better than ever, but you also get the views of experts, like top British CS Lewis and Tolkien buff Colin Duriez, the author of some of the best books around on Tolkien. I have watched this many times - hope you do too!"
3,Seems like Lucas might have something to do with this franchise,"No new material? Just release a new box every now and then. That's basically what this ""new"" set seems like to me. I can't picture any serious collector not having the extended editions already on DVD, and/or waiting for the HD version."
3,"""The DVD box #2""","Well, this is by far the BEST DVD box that i ever bought, as a fan of tolkien those extra cenes just blown me away, i feel like it was a new Lord of The Rings movie.If you're a fan of Middle Earth this dvd is a ""must have"" in the dvd section.One of the extra scenes show the relationship of Boromir and his brother Faramir back at Gondor, and what happens before Boromir travel to Rivendell to join the Council of Elrond and the Fellowship of the Ring, just stunning.Buy the Return of the King and Fellowship of the ring too, you will not be dissapointed."
5,"Superb movie, great extras","The theatrical release of ""The Two Towers"" was superb, and the extended edition here has mixed extra baggage. Some of the scenes seem crucial (the Aragorn/Brego scene springs to mind, as does the Boromir/Faramir stuff), but many show that the editing was right to begin with.In any event, the extras on the two other DVDs are very well worth it for the fan. They take you behind the scenes in a thorough and interesting manner, and reveal some of the magic without diminishing the effect.Overall, a great set for the fan of this spectacular trilogy."
5,An Epic Movie Classic!,"There is no better movies out there than the amazing ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was incredible! But, believe it or not, Its sequel ""The Two Towers"" is even more incredible! With a great music (score), spectacular visual effects, and great acting ""The Two Towers"" was easily the best movie in 2002. There is a lot of good drama, action/adventure, and excitement in this wonderful movie (making it one of my favorite films ever). ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is still one of my favorite movies ever (along side with ""The Two Towers""). ""The Return of the King"" will be a HUGE phenomenon! It will be the best movie in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy."
4,"Good, but just wait.","Okay, the movie was absolutely awesome. As others have previously stated, however, just wait for the release of the deluxe edition. I purchased this version of The FotR and I absolutely love it. I think it would be wise to hold out and buy the big version later. However, I won't be able to wait so I'll just rent it between August and the time the deluxe edition comes out."
4,As expected,"From the first movie you could expect what would happen, and this one proves it was well written as was the special effects. I especially enjoyed the sequence of the trees coming to life. I would like to see more of the special effects in this movie involving the Elves, which they bring an important part of the movie. All in all it is not a movie you can just up and leave the room, you miss one second of The Two Towers you'll be confused. In the beginning I had no idea what was a dream and what was real, it went back and forth so much that after a few minutes you hoped they didn't go back into a dream sequence again. I enjoyed the movie, excellent casting, directing and a well written script. Take out the popcorn and don't move."
4,why split up the movie? to make more MONEY!! >:(,"i absolutely HATE the fact that both extended LOTR editions split up the movie on two discs. That's absolutely absurd. The Gladiator DVD has TONs of material on both discs, so the technology is definitely there. DVD's can hold way more than 3.5 hours that the movie is. Other than that annoying trait that's obviously not going to change (because they can charge more for 4-discs than 2), this is a great edition that fills in a few more blanks that the theatrical version had to have to fit into studio preferred time limits."
4,"Pretty Good, But...","I thought the movie was pretty good. I thought the Helms Deep part was to long. It was an hour and a half long!!! I thought the part where Gandalf came back was cool. And Gollum was really cool! Andy Serkis was really great.I think this movie is really great, although a little dragging, but i think you should get it!!!!!!"
3,"Rebuttal of rebuttal of ""devout purist""","Grantefd you don;t have to put every minor detail, or stick to any minor detail at all, but in a movie adaptation you cannot expect people who've read a book to like the movie if you change absolutely EVERY major decision made, these weren't subtle changes they masacres of characters thay changed people who are amazingly humble and kind hearted (for a reason) to be sado-heartless idiots. Please don't make judgemens like ""you can't expect everything down to the minute detail to be the same"" if you donlt know that they changed everything. Still it was better than the first one, just."
5,Great release,"This extended version of Lord of the Rings has meet and exceeded my expectations for a blu-ray. It is such a well made product that there is no point in the film where you realize it looks fake or the stageing and background pops out as fake. I do wish that they had been able to fit the full movies onto one blu-ray, but that was my only complaint."
5,Product Review,Great Movie. This is just my opinion and I'm writing this because in order to leave a review I must have a certain amount of words in my review. Really!!! AYFKM. Jusy Saying.
3,Remember last year? Order with caution!,"Look, the movie's great, but remember what happened lastyear with LotR: FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING! There was onerelease in the summer, with some extras, and a Christmasrelease of a deluxe edition with audio commentaries andother desirable features.Order if you must, but be prepared for a much morefeature-packed DVD to appear in a few months.If I need to see THE TWO TOWERS before then,I'll rent."
3,good movie for non-purists,"the movie is excellent for non-purists, but I agree with previous reviewers that the director added extra drama that is not needed, because the book supplies enough drama and excitement. I think that if they followed the book more closely and did not make a major errors (elves helping Rohan (first born generally do not associate with the Edain); aragorn falling; ents being portrayed as dumb; faramir wanting the ring for gondor, the total opposite of the book) that the movie would be better to watch. The book is dramatic and exciting enough with changing it for movies. Hopefully this problem of not following the book will be rectified in return of the king."
3,yawn,"I don't understand the adulation these movies have received from their fans. Especially the Two Towers. Lots of fun if you like endless UGLY battle footage. And mud. I really enjoyed the books as a kid, but the films just didn't do it for me.Ivan Rorick"
5,Excellent movie!!,"Great movie. The DVD video quality is great, the menus are nice, and is nicely compacted in 2 DVD's. You should have it!"
1,LONG LONG LONG,"Good thing i rented the movie because i was able to pause and go to the kitchen, bathroom, etc, then back.It was an obnoxiously slow movie. Yeah it had some good moments and of course Sir Ian McKellan put in a great performance, but good lord, how painfull must have been to see this in the theatre."
1,very boring,"It's very boring. The graphics are very poor. Also too much violents, not very good for children. I don't have much to write about it.Anyway, if you are a true Load of the ring fan don't see it. It's bad."
1,POOR SCRIPT,This movie has absolutely nothing to do with Tolken's The Lord of the Rings. I've never been so disappointed in my life.
3,The most inadequate movie I've seen this year...,This movie was ok... The fight was great... but one thing leaves me uneasy. THIS MOVIE DOES NOT PROGRESS FROM THE FIRST ONE! Frodo and Sam are still trying to get to the tower... The other hobbits are still lost in the woods... and the armies of the eye almighty is still being built... through in a few trees and you have the two towers... if you just watch the first LotR and the third... you wouldn't miss a thing.. If you'd like to see good fight scenes go see it... other then that just skip this...
1,I`m sorry it ended..,"When the movie finished after almost three hours I was sorry it ended...Spectacular movie! I just wanna thanks Mr. Peter Jackson.The cast is marvellous, everything is top of the game. But just don't expect it to be so faithful an adaptation as the first film was. He centered around Aragorn....Also, I'd like to know, adding the totals from the first and second movies, how many creatures have Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli already killed. I think it may be a new world record for movies...GOLLUM is the treasure here. Simply perfect.All in all, Peter Jackson is giving a lesson to George Lucas of how to use special effects in pro of the history and, AT THE SAME TIME, to develop great characters and obtain great performances from his actors..."
5,"Love the movie, eh to the books.","Seems like heresy to actually love watching the movies but be semi-bored by the books, but that is my take. For all of you out there that are critical of the movies because they take license with the books content, then too bad. The books are very detailed and will never translate perfectly to the big screen, so let it go. These movies are the next best thing."
3,Where are the Theatrical Trailers?,Part of the fun of home theater is recreating the movie experience from buttered popcorn to the thunder of hooves produced by your subwoofer.Sometimes the trailer is better than the actual movie itself. Cut out some of the needless cast chitchat and give us back all of the trailers! Now I'm going to have to skip the extended edition with DTS (a major plus) for the crappy dolby digital version which has the trailers. Thanks for nothing!
1,Such a disappointment,"After Fellowship of the Ring, I expected much more from The Two Towers than I received! It was such a digression from the reality of the book that it could be considered an entirely different novel that was filmed.Major spoilers follow!Eomer (and the Riders of Rohan with him) was not banished and did not ride to the north;The King of Rohan did not 'retreat' to Helms Deep with his people;Gandalf did not have to ride of to get Eomer;The Elves did not help defend Helm's Deep;The Ents did not say no to going to war;Where were the Huorns;Faramir was not the smarmy betrayer as shown - he was much more honorable;The Tolkien family should NEVER have allowed such a dishonorable piece of trash to be shown!"
2,Films aren't like the book,"I know the film can't follow the book but it changed too much, even the animated version was able to follow the book alot closer than this one. This film changed the characters a bit much also especially Faramir. Yes I agree films can't follow the books too closely but this one went further than the rest. Yes it was a good film if you hadn't read the book especially the effects. I don't care how Pippin removed his broach, teeth or hands but changing whole battles as at Helms Deep, where they did have warriors not just old men, women and children. Elves didn't need to be there to make the battle. I will not be going to see the next film until it comes out on pay-per-view and I'm feeling curious."
5,The Battle for Middle-Earth is about to begin,"When I first saw this in theater I knew that it was good. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli were captovating. When we come back to Frodo and Sam. and there harsh struggles, and Gollum how badly he was treated by Sam. All of this was good This is a mind blowing movie. It will practicly keep you guessing till the end. Now when Dec. 17 Comes we will see the last part. but for now we are come to The Two Towers. the most riviting film of our time and I agree for what Rickard Corliss says. ""The supreme film adventure of our time. Own it today."
5,Problems with disks 3 and 4,"I just got (after waiting more than 1 month) the 4 dvd extended edition and disks 3 and 4 didn't work for me either.Disc manufacturers are mentioned on Box as ""Disc Made In Germany""The movie played fine, but disks 3 and 4 would only play on my pc's dvd. My dvd player is an Aiwa XD-DV370.Rate is for movie, not for package!"
1,"Boring,","Can you get any more boring, i mean the first one had a story but this one is pointless fighting all the way throw, don't watch this, 3 hours long! 3 HOURS OF POINTLESS FIGHTING. I think this film is so boring i'll give you 10p not to see it! It's as boring as watching paint dry! DON'T WATCH THIS IT IS BORING! When watching it in the cenmair, i left the room! Guess that's 3.00 i'll never see again!"
3,Did someone say wait for a LONGER version?,"My complaint is that the thing is just tooooooooooooo long, just like Fellowship. I enjoy the story (which is why 3 stars is appropriate) and all but how can they expect repeated viewings at 3 hours and they will add more to the Super duper special edition in Oct? Enough already. Titanic ruined the movies with its ""Epic"" 3+ hour flick. I don't know about you, but I wait for the DVD on these. How can you sit in a nasty movie theater chair for half the day?"
5,Awsome!,... The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an awsome movie! It is better than the book! I saw it three times in theaters
5,"Puts other ""special edition"" DVDs to shame","Wow. I have just finished watching this near 4 hour epic, and I am just blown away! After enjoying the movie version, it's hard to believe that an extra 42 minutes could make such a big difference, but it does and I absolutely loved every minute!It's hard to imagine how a movie like Lord Of The Rings could be made better. And I haven't even looked at the extras yet!This DVD set puts other DVD ""special editions"" to shame. If you're hesitant to buy this one, let me assure you, you won't regret it. If you enjoyed The Two Towers at the movies, you'll absolutely love this extended edition, as it really fleshes out the story, as well as providing a few very pleasant surprises.Now stop reading these and go buy it :-)"
4,This is the EXTENDED VERSION,"The extended version of The TT is going to be a lot better then the theatrical version (as was The FOTR). The Two Towers is a big book, and to put it into a 3 hour timeframe is hard to do. The extended version will hopefully make up for some of the scenes left out (the disgruntled forest for example). If you have the non-extended version DvD, make sure to check out the preview for the extended version, it will show you some nice scenes. On the other hand though, there is little excuse for the stuff which was added to the film (Arwen Saga, wargs, Helms deep accounting for a third of the movie). But then again, you want to keep the movie somewhat exciting, and Tolkein can lecture on in some parts. If you have not read any LOTR books you will like the movie a lot more then if you haven't, but if given the choice read the books first."
5,Virtually Perfect,"Excellent excellent excellent. The acting was absolutely flawless. The images, props and landscapes capture the spirit of Tolkien. Golem/Smeagol was better than I'd ever imagined him to be. Here are my minor complaints: The Ents could have been a tad better (too small, and voices not as old and wise as I imagined). Some sequences of Aragorn were so blatant in depicting him as a sexy macho man it almost reminded me of zoolander. Legolas riding a shield down the stairs while picking off orcs with his bow was just lame and unnecessary. The comic relief provided at Gimli's expense was good, but maybe needed to be counterbalanced a bit - he didn't come off as tough as he could have. Enough of the nitpicking. 3 hours went by like it was 1 hour. I want more more more!!!!"
5,The Best Out Of The 3 Collections.,"I ordered this off the net and It took so dang look jus for it to come. And the wait was worth it! Almost every single episode on this collection is worth watching. The voice acting has really grown on me, especially Jun's after watching all those girls audition I think Kim Prause was the one who really got Jun's voice down. Anyways there still are a couple of boring episodes but they are heavily surrounded by more exciting ones. Be sure to pick this one up you'll enjoy it more than the second collection.Highlights Include-Gallactor's Witch Racer-The Invisible Devil-Gallack X, The Demon Man-The Plan To Assinate Dr. Nambu-The Grand Gezora Operation Pt I/II"
3,Better to buy at the store,"It was a bit dry and has almost no smell left. Since I only bought one, it's not worth returning, but I will stick to buying ink pads at the store since I can return them if they are dried out."
4,smells yummy but hard to wash off of skin and clothes,"It doesn't say it is washable, but I typically think that toys and crafts for kids should be easy to wash off of skin and clothes, not with this product. I would recommend only buying this for older children."
1,Arrived dry...,"There was no ink in it. I ordered another scent, which contained some ink, but not much. Poor quality control."
2,Doesn't ink well,The smell is cool but the ink itself is very light. Cannot see the stamp design very well compared to the other colors I purchased.
2,"Barely see, barely smell","The color is very, very light. It's not that the stamp pad is running out, it's just that it's a very light pink. The smell is so faint that you have to really, really, really know it's there or you don't smell it."
2,Disappointing offering from literary giant,"Good grief, do we really need another memoir? These things are proliferating like quack grass. Ah, but this one is by Robert Stone, one of the four or five best writers in America...and that makes it all the more disappointing. While Stone hung out with some interesting characters (Kesey, Neal Cassady, Paul Newman), his remembrances are anecdotal, unformed, shapeless. He meanders from one episode to the next and though the company is congenial, the end result is unsatisfactory. A good, lengthy interview with the man would have served just as well. Mr. Stone is a literary genius but PRIME GREEN is a minor effort, undistinguished and lacking his characteristic focus and intensity."
2,Prime Ramblings,"Yet another book badly in need of an editor--uneven, disjointed ruminations by a talented writer and keen observer, who lost this reader within the first 50 pages."
2,"If you can remember the Sixties this well, well...","The clliched quip, ""If you can remember the Sixties you weren't really there,"" gets a firm refutation here. That may be the only good news. The bad news is that so little of what Stone has to offer here is worth remembering. Sure, there is no point in lying about the Sixties, or making up stories just to sound good, but a litany of drugs (covering a wide range), alcohol, infidelity, a bad movie, mindless jobs, and cheap apartments obscures a writing talent and any truly enjoyable reflection on the era. If you are looking for nostalgia, this isn't going to provide much meaningful insight or satisfaction, just primarily name and drug dropping. If you are looking for a stream-of-consciousness, muddled, trail through the fortgettable parts of the Sixties, you might find this to be of interest."
3,Disappointing,"This book does not come up to the standards of Stone's classic novels. There really is very little in this book at all and certainly gives little insight into ""the Sixties."""
3,"Prime Green, ""Remembering the 60's""","I was very much looking forward to this book as there haven't been many good ones written on the subject. I was disappointed however, that the author made it more about himself and his experiences during that time. He didn't really tie these experiences into the cultural phenomena that was happening. I was more interested in how he saw the overall picture. How has the culture shifted? What were the redeeming qualities? What went wrong? Why hasn't anything like this occurred since? I wanted a more sociological perspective as seen through one person's eyes....a lofty order, but that's what I was hoping to read. It was a well written book however, and I enjoyed it."
3,stoned,"Robert Stone has written his recollections of the sixties in this outing and it has some interesting insights to be sure. Stone was at the epicenter of some of the era's most ballyhooed events. Most interesting here, especially in light of the 50th anniversary of ""On the Road"" are his descriptions of Neal Cassidy and other members of Ken Kesey's band of pranksters.On the whole, though, Stone seems to ramble from one thought to another and sometimes the links between chapters are missing from my point of view. I suppose that given the source, an ""a to z"" account, would, in itself be inappropriate.The sixties were an era that has been looked at from many perspectives. It is a hard time to understand. Prime Green is an important viewpoint, providing insight into certain elements of the decade, but it is not a major work for those in search of the bigger picture."
2,Disappointing,"Surely I'm not the only one who was disappointed with this book. It was a fine read, but I don't feel like I learned anything new about Stone or the 60s. It seemed like several chapters were forced in order to get enough pages for a real book. Although I am a big fan of Robert Stone's other works (especially Dog Soldiers), I cannot recommend this one even to his fans."
1,"It only gets one star, because that's the worst I can give.","Oh My God. What a horrible rendition of the best rock opera ever. If you have never heard JCS or you don't own a copy, please don't buy this . . . . Wait, don't buy this anyway. This recording out of Quebec, deserves to be thrown to a pack of vicious tone-deaf wolves. And even that would be a mercy killing. One word sums it up. Crap. The Judas with a ""lithp"" has got to go. The entire cast over-enunicates and their spontaneous creativeness sounds rehearsed. Basically, a Mormon church choir trying a bit too hard to sound rockish. It doesn't work for me at all. Generally, there is a high point to any highlights album, but this one doesn't even have that. Run from this one as fast as you can. This is an example of something that you CAN knock before you try it."
5,"""Justice Waits"" honoring murder victims, longing for more innocent times","This is unlike any true crime book that I've ever read. I got to know Sabrina and John, the murder victims, and their families. This book honors them without making them too good to be true. The criminals are not sensationalized. The innocence of Davis, California appealed to my longing for the safety and security of the past. The case was very complex, but the Who's Who and Chronology at the end of the book helped me keep it straight. The book was intriguing, and I felt compelled to read it until it was finished."
4,Justice Waits,"The author did an incredible amount of research and it was obvious that he knew the Sacramento/ Yolo county area as only a native would. He wrote objectively about a double murder that engendered more passion and outrage than possibly any crime in the area's history. In fact, it was his tenacity and dogged determination that helped convict the person responsible.Incredibly, he completed the book while being stricken with Parkinson's disease in the course of writing it.An admirable achievement!Thank you Mr. Davis"
1,Pure tripe,"... A totally simplistic (and simple-minded) overview of a complex problem, this book gives no hard-and-fast information about anything. Be sure to read the rest of the reviews posted here -- I won't bother to repeat what others have stated so eloquently about the utter uselessness and ineffectualness of this stupid book."
2,Read this before buying,"Ce livre ne m'a pas donné assez d'information, c'est assez superficiel. Bref, le livre n'est pas complet et ne m'as pas servi à grand chose."
1,Buy the standard edition and save money¡¡,"Dear Mr. Chesky:I just want to remind you there's a center chanel available in SACD Multi chanel recordings. You forget about it in this record and make it feels useless.Regards,Me"
5,Milho Verde,"Actually, Milho Verde was rediscovered by Jose Afonso in his 1971 Cantigas do Maio -- probably the best album ever in the history of Portuguese folk music. Regardless, India is an excellent album from one of the best voices who has ever sung in Portuguese."
5,Gal explores new territory,"""Índia"" is one of my favorite Gal albums for many reasons. Though it's much more subtle than her previous releases, it remains a very complex and at times, challenging listen. This albums essentially marks the end of gal's ""rock"" period, though it's evident by listening to the first few tracks on the album that she still had plenty of tricks up her sleeve. While I'd definitely consider this a folk record at it's core, there's a very prominent progressive, yet oddly accessible element attached to quite a few of the tracks. A transitional album, ""Índia"" catches Gal straddling the lines of MPB superstardom and the avant garde tendencies that played such a huge part in much of her earlier work.Listen to: ""Índia"", ""Volta"", ""Presente Cotidiano"", ""Desafinado""."
1,The worst book I have read,This book was not worth more than .50. It was horribly written (English and spelling and sentence structure). It also had no real climax or ending. I can't imagine why this girl ever got this book through. At the end was a page saying that she did not know the proper use of verbs and I can believe it!! It was real gruesome with no real story to it.
1,leaks real bad,"the lids do not hold water. I use the bottles with the injector tip to spray water on to ice to defrost refrigerators, no mater what I do the tops always leak.DO NOT BUY!!!! you will be disapointed"
5,Basting Bottle and Injector Kit,I have not use this items very much but it looks great and I thik it will do the job it was purchased for...
2,Does not match up with other HABA block sets,"We love our Haba block sets. We have the standard set and the ball track construction set. We got this fully expecting that the blocks would fit right in with the rest of our Haba blocks, but unfortunately they are not only smaller, but at a size where they can NEVER line up (you can get close if you stack them in sets of fours, but the lines are still off). Imagine the frustration of buying a new LEGO set only to find that they changed the size of the pegs on top, making it incompatible with the rest of your LEGO sets. It's not quite that bad but pretty close.In other words, this is awesome as a stand-alone toy and if you just want to build variants on the coliseum. But they need to label it differently so people won't make the same mistake we did."
4,This one's for thrashers,"Now before you go off on me and saying how i dont know anything about Bathory consider the fact that Bathory has something to offer to fans of nearly all genre's of metal and personally, I love nearly all their albums.I've heard people remark that this album is ""...not worth bathory worship"", meaning tributes or cover songs, but thats just bs and those people know nothing about thrash. This album is a full on thrashing deathfest, with that old metal attitude that we all love. The riffs are very catchy and it all works because the music is not watered down at all. My only complaint is that i would like to see more lead guitar. Otherwise if youre into thrash or even death metal along the lines of Vader and Vomitory this album is a great buy."
2,Vaunted Scofield Notes,"The purpose of ""Study Notes"" is to gain a deeper understanding of the text. The Scofield notes are indeed wonderful but once you pass the midpoint of Genesis, the number of notes tail off to 2 or 3 per written page. Perhaps I have been spoiled by the number of footnotes in my MacArthur NASB Study Bible but I believe that a study Bible's purpose is to lead your contemplations, hand in hand, to wisdom."
5,Study Bible,I'm using this Bible for most reading. The New King James version is easier to read. The foot-notes and study aides are great. I enjoy this tremendously.
4,Study Bible,The Scofield study Bible is a good study Bible. I like the way it is laid out and the study notes help to add or explain meaning.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this Bible with hopes it would come as it says with a zipper leather case, it is not it is a large hard bound book. :( Now I will not be able to take it with me as I had anticipated! :("
2,"GOOD quality, but Not what I expected.","Purchased two(2) of these. On for my son, one for my friend.Pages are MUCH too thin. Leather poor quality. STUDY format MUCH TOOOO ""busy"".Print is small. Definetely could have purchased OTHER choices on amazon & I should have."
1,No zipper wanted,This bible has a zipper for use in closing...I did not realize that it had a zipper. It is not good.
3,Bible,"This was given as a gift. It is well put together, however heavy to carry around and hopefully the receiver liked it."
5,A Classic Study Bible,I never thought I'd see the day when you had to be selective about which study Bible to choose but that time has come. The Scofield Study Bible happens to be one of the better ones out there. Highly recommended!
5,"The ScofieldRG Study Bible III, NKJV","I am truly enjoying my new The ScofieldRG Study Bible III, NKJV. As a pastor I need good sound references in my sermon preparation. this Bible has been very useful. I highly recommend it to anyone"
4,Time well spent,"Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy analyzes the strategies to employ in the information driven economy. The book was a well written analysis of how some of the fashionable words like cyber-space and information superhighway have caused managers to create fad strategies. While we may employ some new strategies in the information economy, fundamental economic principles and business strategies still apply. The book takes you through what it means to be an information business, and how to leverage your own information content and customer knowledge to formulate a successful business strategy. There is a solid fundamental analysis of new strategies, but those that are based on bedrock economic and business rules."
3,What a Wichita State Student Thinks,"I'm not an economist, so I really appreciate how the authors breakdown all the concepts into laymen's terms. And my instructor seems to like this book, so I'm stuck reading it--so I might as well get some good out of it."
5,"Easy read, excellent Econonic Book about IT","Some of these concepts in the book are like common sense that we know them but fail to explain them well, but the authors manage to describe them in words and with examples. I especially like chapter 5, 6 and 7, which address the lock-in, switching cost, network effects and positive feedback. They also show us how to deal with lock-in issues from both sides, as the suppliers and as the customers. If anyone ever wonders how to explain why Microsoft could be so successful, please ask him/her to read those 3 chapters."
1,Not worth buying,"Frankly, if you already have a minimal culture in economics, you do not need this book : it takes far too long to say obvious and basic things."
5,Best Book in Information Technology Phenomenon,Readers should have an basic in some Economic. You can see the world be changed by IT.
2,Not Particularly Insightful,"This book says nothing new that has not been said before - such as increasing returns by Brian Arthur. The book looks at the problem of selling digital goods from the perspective of economic theory such as theory of complements and network externalities. The book is useful as a primer on economic theory with examples from the Internet space. However, there is little insight for a budding entrepreneur about how to create new value or how to create differentiation in the web marketspace. From the marketing hype that has enveloped this book, I definitely expected more. The book was quite dry and could have used more contemporary examples."
3,Easy introduction to the Economics of Information,"This text deserves to be updated. The economic principles described are still as relevant as ever, but the examples provided are a decade out of date."
3,Approaches management problems from an economic standpoint,"The authors say that the circumstances of one era may be unique, but the underlying principles that govern the exchange of goods in a free-market economy are the same. The book is about the economy rather than managing information itself."
5,Understanding the Network Economy is easy!,"Understanding the Network Economy is easy, why? The rules to understand you already know. It is not magic, the same rules that businesses and markets, followed for many rules govern also the network economy. OK, things are faster, feedback can be the make or break a company, customers are getting looked in, ...But all this is not new, to understand it better, to be better prepared for the new challenges, read the book."
2,Unless you truly do not understand Economics...,"...it's really not all that informative. In the last 10 years there have been significant changes in analytical and evaluative techniques which impact our economic perspectives. This book offered nothing new to what I learned in business school 20 years ago. The only reason I gave them a 2 was that they did capture a few ""historical"" perspectives on various companies in the technology field - but those could have been summarized in a magazine article."
4,Fascinating,"I read this for an information-age econ class I'm taking, and I really liked it. The authors refute the idea that traditional economic rules don't apply to the age of computers, information trading and cyber sales. They make a convincing case that it's all the same econ, just a new application, and I learned a great deal from it about both the traditional models and the economics of selling information. I really recommend it for anyone. It's very readable, accessible and cogent."
4,A must read before talking about new economy,"Extremely interesting book with a lot of excellent examples about information economy along with smart suggestions about key strategic choices in hot topics like managing lock-in, standards, etc. A little bit too USA oriented but a must read nonetheless"
2,Should come under teenage reading,"I too wish I had researched this book more. It was not a book that I would normally read,a book I would not have finished had I got it from the local library, then again it would not have been in the adult section.Most disappointing."
5,remarkable,"This was the first book by Menkel I ever read - not knowing it was meant for ""young adults"". It is moving and memorable - an insightful exploration of the relationship between an emerging adolescent and his father. IF only kids in our middle schools could read such psychologically true and completely authentic storeis, we would all be better off!"
2,Absolutely NOT A MYSTERY!!,"Attempts to be a ""boy's coming of age"" novel, a genre that's been done to death. Sweet, but dull."
2,Looks good - Not well made,"Bought this watch for a cruise vacation i just came back from. Watch looks nice and has solid feel to it. I somehow thougth Timex was a no-nonsense inexpensive quality watch. What happened here is this: whenever i bent my hand upwards i would occaisionally press the bezel which would illuminate the watch. if it were only for that second or some, no problem. BUT the buttion would somehow get 'stuck' and the illumination would stay on for minutes at a time, or until i manually pullled on the bezel a bit. to make a long story short, the battery went dead after only 10 days of use! NOT GOOD."
5,Heavy Duty,Got this for a sander I bought. This sandpaper is heavy duty and works well with our sander. Long lasting and thick paper. Can cut out to prefered size.
3,Sand paper,I bought this thing to flatten my 1000 grit water stone and it did a very good job but i also tried to use it to sharpen my night stalker Bowie knife and it didn't do anything but scratch it since the knife is made very crappy steel.
4,Great for a Beginning Overview,"This book was never intended to be used for in-depth study. I have studied the Kabbalah for many years and I use this book as a reference when I need a quick reminder, a simple definition or just want to organize my thoughts when I am doing a presentation about Kabbalah.I recommend this book for people who are curious about the Kabballah but don't know if they want to commit to serious study. Traditional texts and classes can get you bogged down very quickly, but this book presents a clear, concise description of what the Kabbalah is and how it can be used.Great for beginners."
3,Too many diagrams not enough text,"A simplistic text which uses artwork and diagrams to dumb down the scriptural basis of Kaballah. This short read is full of pictures and diagrams that try to walk the reader through the mysteries of Kaballah, explaining the many aspects of it and illuminating its basics to the reader. The problem here is that the book does not give a full picture of Kabalistic works. The Zohar, one of the prime texts of Kaballah, is not shown to be a biblical commentary, which is it, but rather this book portrays Kaballah almost as if it were Yoga or some esoteric mystical faith, not founded securely in Jewish thought and religion. Probably this book might be a bare minimum of introduction but it requires more reading for one to appreciate what Kaballah really means. Danny Matt's 'Zohar' is a for more acceptable read."
1,what you could have done with the money,"Have you heard the new Melissa Ethridge CD by Chris Mills? If way over-the-top, unbelievable and overly dramatic is for you then perhaps you would like this. In which case you should buy records by Creed, Live and Hootie."
5,just as i expected,"this sand paper was just as i expected, shipped quickly and worked well. i love having an assortment of grits because 1 doesn't do every job."
3,too pricey,love the look of this scale in my sons bathroom but it stopped workin in a few months! dunno why :(I don't think i got my money's worth for the short use
2,Cute but not what was expected,"The picture on the scale was cute. But the growth chart only went 47"", so if your child is tall or over 3 years old it may not be suitable for any length of time to track their growth."
5,A neglected classic,"Why isn't this, and the first in the series, The Genesis Quest, considered classics in the same league as Anderson's Tau Zero, Asimov's Foundation-Trilogy or many of A. C. Clarke's titles? These stunning visions lacks NOTHING! They are both superb examples of what true science fiction is about, and it is NOT about thinly disguised contemporary criticism, nor cheap shoot-'em-ups a la Star Wars. This is about true sense of wonder, a honest attempt, and a successful one, to get us face to face with truly cosmic visions. I hope to God Mr Moffit's books are successfully greeted in these new editions, because they deserve to be"
5,i hate christmas,"yes its true , its about yule and money, not about christ as purported and i hate the christmas season and christmas songs. Scrooge ? Grinch ? ..whatever....But Lou ! when I heard this cd over a brothers home I had to get it ..Lou is awesome and the band is terrrific..the sound are digitally cleaned up ..its great ""merry christmas baby!"""
3,A noir Set in the Eighties,"The 25th Hour comes highly praised. It's a good read, but those looking for a true crime novel will be disappointed. The author seems to be extrapolating people he knew in high school into the next phase of their lives: wimp into teacher, handsome scholarship boy into drug dealer, best friend into wild-n-crazy bond trader. What makes it rather interesting is that these stock characters went to a fancy NYC private school which seems to have done them no good at all. As a person who once saw the inside of Buckley (which this fictional school resembles), I don't believe it.Worth reading if you want a dark slice of life from somewhere few have been."
2,Hmmmm,"I have to say that I simply thought this book was ok. I didn't think it was great or awful, but I think I was expecting more. Everyone wrote such rave reviews for this book, that I kept waiting for something big to happen and before that did happen, I finished the book...i.e. I don't think anything that exciting ever happened. This book was very easy to read and is also fun to read if you are familiar with the New York City area. It has some interesting happenings throughout, but by the time I finished it, I was a little let down. I guess my only advice is that if it sounds interesting to you, give it a try."
2,Snooze,"I decided to grab this book after reading ""City of Thieves"" one of the best books I've ever read. Unfortunately this tale was dull, with characters I really didn't care about. But I did like the dog and the storyline behind it, but the rest of the storyline was boring.Just not my cup of tea.....sigh."
5,Better than good,Someone told me this was a good book. They were wrong - it was better than good. The story was original and the writing was excellent. I hear that the movie rights have been sold and that production begins this spring. I hope they do the book justice.
5,"On the Second Try, Success!","I first picked up this book back in January at a bookstore. After reading the first few pages, I thought, well, it's well-written, but not my cup of tea. Then I saw a few outstanding reviews and decided to give it a second chance. I'm glad I did. Man oh man, other people have written this before, but the ending knocked me for a loop. Beautiful writing, brilliantly imagined characters, and a vivid evocation of NYC that left me longing for a city I've never been too!!! A nearly perfect short novel-- I'd give it six stars if I could."
2,A failed character study,"I know this book has gotten good reviews, but I just do not know why. This book is not a crime novel; it is not even a novel. It is a failed character study of three friends, who are trying to come to grips with one of them reporting to prison for an inevitable 7 year sentence.Had Benioff delved deeper into each of the three friends, and explored and explained their actions in more detail, I believe the book would have been much more satisfying. As it is, I was left feeling cheated."
5,Best Book of the Year,"I don't usually read crime novels, so when a friend recommended this book, I passed. Then a second friend recommended it, an English professor, and I thought if an English professor likes it, it can't be the standard issue murder/thriller tripe. Now I'm sorry I waited so long. This book is magnificent. I know we've all heard the ""I couldn't put it down"" stuff a million times, but that's literally true with ""The 25th Hour.""My only advice is this: skip the jacket copy text; it gives too much away. Just start with the first sentence, a real beauty.My favorite book of the last twelve months."
1,A Cliche Plagued First Novel,"The concept of an upper middle class white kid facing hard time had such potential for good, subtle tension and conflict. Unfortunately, in the hands of Mr. Benioff the story drags, hindered by cliche characters and jumbled prose. Uncle Blue, the drug supplying boss of the title characer, is a ridiculous caricature of a tough, flamboyant criminal. More of a cartoon than a real character, UNcle Blue's dialogue is painful to read. For modern noir realism and decent hardboiled writing stick to writers such as Peter Dexter and Johnathan Lethem."
5,"Monty, Naturelle, Doyle.......","Great book!I've seen this movie several times over before I figured out that it was a book first. Finally I got around to reading it. Even though I read several other reviews saying how the book was just like the script of the movie. WRONG! The movie is excellent, but its still a movie. The book had so much more outstanding dialogue between the characters and lengthy but very good character descriptions.Monty Brogan is an unforgettable character, his girlfriend Naturelle and ragged pit bull Doyle are also good.Loved the New York City descriptions, although I have never been there, Benioff made it easy to picture it.Benioff is my favorite author, his third book ""City of Thieves"" is one of my all time favorites. If you liked ""The 25th Hour"", do yourself a favor and check out ""City of Thieves"" & ""When the Nines Roll Over"" aslo by Benioff!Enjoy!!"
4,Character study,"For a short quick read, you get an intimate snapshot of a place and time. Pretty straighforward plot that outlines the day before Monty Brogan spends 7 years in a federal prison. Good rainy day read."
5,YES!!!,"Well it took me a longish time to find this book but when i did was it worth it! i agree with the other reader who said she was up all night. Same for me, except i read it so quick i was in bed by midnight. A really good read. It's very dark but i like dark so that was fine. HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!"
1,mild torture,"Well fleshed out characters who do what you think they should do. Since this is his first book, I'm sure subsequent works will be met wtih a keener editor's pen. Includes some interesting trivia, particularly the ball/rat torture trick..yikes."
1,' BIG' let down,"Don't see how 90% of the people who read this book gave it five stars, they must have never read a good novel. The ending was terrible!! In addition, I won't see the movie!!"
2,Reviewers Pack Mentality is Worrying,"I've seen this happen before with books like 'Prague,' and 'Wonder Boys.' The book doesn't, cannot, support the hype. This book by David Benioff is a cute book. It's not going to be a classic, and will undoubtedly be forgotten in less than 12 months after the release of the movie. Why are the reviewers talking about ""ringing the cash registers?"" Is that a valid critical standard for the judging of new fiction? What's wrong with this country's critics -- are they afraid to stand out, to part with the crowd like the little boy who saw the king was wearing no clothes? It's worrying. The book is being hyped. It's not that good."
2,SAD,This is a story about sad individuals and their sad lives. They have no redeeming values whatsoever. A waste of time and money.
4,Fast-paced read,"I read City of Thieves and loved it, so I wanted to read another by the same author. I was happy with the pace of this book and like the ending."
5,Easy!,"wonderful product, wonder why they ever discontinued the color without replacing it with something similar...easy to order from Amazon. Very pleased overall."
5,Gone to the Dogs (Dog Lover's Mysteries),Susan Conant has done it again another great adventure that dog lovers everywhere will enjoy. I couldn't put it down.
1,Not Cautious Enough,"I liked Filbert, the main character. But I'm concerned that little children might interpret the story differently than what the author intended and think it's OK if they don't look both ways because cars will always be able to look out for them even though they're not crossing in a safe manner. For example, in one of the illustrations, Filbert is darting in traffic all around him without crossing safely yet manages to get across the street. I'm a teacher and I wouldn't want my kids to read this book for this reason."
4,Great MP3 player.....,"Just got this unit for my birthday. I'm really impressed with the player and the software that comes with the unit. Only two negatives: Not enough volume, my sony walkman radios have a lot more volumne (I like loud, rocking music!) and second, the manual that comes on the CD is confusing at best, poorly organized and just does a minimum job of explaining how to change settings and use the software.Definitely would buy this product again!"
3,"Good Mp3 Player, Voice Recorder Format Proprietary","I just got the unit today, nice little mp3 player. But I needed to record client recommendations for a web project. The format ends up being a .nvf. What's that? I tried downloading some software to convert nvf to mp3 to no avail. I'd rate the unit a 5 if the voice recordings were in an mp3 format, a 4 if they were in a wav or wma, but a nvf....please.Bottom line if you're looking for an mp3 player/mp3 voice recorder....don't buy it. But if you don't mind playing your voice recordings on the unit or with the Creative software, buy it."
4,Very Good,"I bought my Nomad IIc about 1 3/4 years ago and i still listen to it all the time. Its really great. It has been dropped many times by my friends and has some large scratches on it but it still plays and works perfect. Also if u want to put more songs on, just lower the quality level."
4,Great little player...,"I have had this player for about 9 months or so, but it seems like longer because I use it almost everyday. It is a nice size, and just great overall. I like the visual display, and it gets decent battery life, about 8 hours per one AA. I had a little trouble using it when I first got it because the instructions are laughable, just one tiny pamphlet with about three pictures. After that, though, I fell in love. I seriously use it constantly, and I have dropped it countless times, lost the battery plate on the back, and yet it still works. It's also easy to use SmartMedia cards. I installed a 64MB because I wanted more space, but an hour's worth of music is pretty good."
5,Great Product for the Price,I bought this mp3 player for my girlfriend and she loves it. I bought a 128 meg card also and there is enough room to put about 3 1/2 cds on it. I have read reviews about the clip being bad and it not holding it on and so far she has no complaints also I have heard complaints about the volume level not being high enough she says not so it is definitly loud enough for her. However she has complained about the head phones pinching her ears a little. GRET BUY FOR ME!!!!!!
1,Rating?,"Hi,As long as I am not accessible to such products, how can I rate?Is there anyway to order it here?"
3,It was alrite,"I bought this product in early July...it is now Halloween and it's broken. It worked fine for a while, but in about late september, the heaphone jack on it messed up and the contacts weren't touching the headphone contacts. I knew it wasn't the headphones, because I bought different ones, and I also used the auxilarie hook-up to some speakers I had. Plus, the warranty only lasted 90 DAYS!!!! its like they expected sumthin to go wrong!!! all-in-all its pretty good, but not worth payin ... canadian for it, there are better products for your money."
5,Great MP3 Player,"The Nomad IIc is awesome. The voice recording is very helpful in man situations, and sometimes just fun to play with. I wish that it was 128 instead of 64, but not a big deal. The headphones that came with it are also great, very comfortable. The price is the best though, with the mail-in rebate...This is the best price I've found for any other MP3 player. I strongly recomend this."
2,Only get this if you want one album of songs on here!,"I wish I made a better choice when I gave my father my christmas list with this on here. I should of known that 64MB only holds about 25 songs. I have 42 CD which is 566 songs on them. That 13.5 songs per album.The headphones don't last over six months, you're always buying batteries like crazy and sometimes the little thing lock up on you. I have drop this thing like crazy so many time that I have to give it some time to play again. The next on I'm getting will be between 1-4GB which is 250-1000 on mp3 fomat!"
5,Villasenor does it once again.........,"Burro Genius has been added to my list of favorite books, along with some of his previous work....Learning about the way his teachers abused him and the way his classmates disrespected and hated him because he was Mexican made me feel helpless.....it made me wish many times through out the book that it would've been me who they'd disrespected and slapped around just so that I could do something about it.It's an experience that makes him feel out-of-place and turns him into an angry child who, at one point, becomes ashamed of who he is and where his family comes from.It's crazy how Villasenor, along with other Mexican kids, was forced to speak ""English Only"" and now that's all changed. America encourages and almosts expects of people to learn more than one language. Like a slap in the face...."
2,Not my cup of tea,"It is my opinion that this book was very poorly written. I has a great overall meaning, but I still don't see how people can praise this book as a 5 star book. It gets a 2 at best."
1,whiney,this book was terrible. complete waste of time. i had to read this thing for a mex-am lit class and the other books read were awesome. i was hopeful this would be an undiscovered treasure. no such luck. the author often repeats himself while writing about events that would be boring if i were actually experiencing them. in third person they are actually painful. i hate that this book exists.
1,"No, thanks",I couldn't finish the book. There is a reason so many publishers passed on the manuscript.
3,As described.,"The book was in good condition. It is an old library book so had all the expected library cover, date stamps, etc."
5,Highly recommended,"Turkey and her history often a very challenging subject. Usually you can't able to please the reader, as most of them approaching to anything about Turkey in a very negative way. I saw some reviews about books on our history which have full of nasty comments. I am sure most of them wrote these reviews without reading that particular book. Just to blacken Turkish people, their history and culture. Personally I feel really very sorry about these reviews and the reviewers. Nobody must try to cover up bad things happen during our ancestors time and as well as nobody must keep on lying in order to destroy huge history of Turkish People.This book one of many I read about Ottoman times clearly comes first in terms of detailed information, knowledge of story telling and objective approach to the subject. A very enjoyable book. Will recommend to anyone."
2,Not about K nor his teaching,"Reading this book I got the impression that I was reading Pupul's biography and not Krishnamurti's. The author stresses what she thinks is important and stretches stories too much to sort of prove that K. had some mystical experiences as those associated with the awakening of Kundalini. It is badly written and ends up being a very boring read. Still, it gives you some insight as to how Krishnamurti lived, but don't expect too much from it. It's more like a random collection of memories than a biography. Buy one of Krishnamurti's books instead."
5,Brilliantly written biography,Succintly sums up the life and teachings of J.Krishnamurthy in one go. The right book for someone new to J.Krishnamurthy. Touches upon his teachings which shake your whole being.
3,Houses and Homes,"The pictures were very good. It showed many homes in different parts of the world. However, it was not very good for 4's and 5's. When I read it at school to my Pre-k class, they could not stay focused."
3,Warm but not durable,The robe is warm and very comfortable I wear it often and its the best one I ever had. However the little that was made so it can hang on hooks broke off after only having it for a few weeks. Which can be and is annoying when I try to hang it up. Otherwise its a quality robe.
5,Well Worth Your Money!,"This double CD of both chronicles is a steal. Having only owned one Eloy album (Floating) way back when, I can't say that I'm an expert on the band but I am a long-time fan of space music or whatever title you want to give the genre. If you are a fellow music fan of the Floyd, Yes, Genesis, Camel, Nektar and the like, you will enjoy every track offered in this package. Of the many Amazon purchases I have made in the past year this one is by far the most satisfying. Brilliant guitar and keyboard solos bring the listener into the ethreal world of Eloy.Get this CD. Five bright stars for this one...(Thanks to all the other reviewers at Amazon for all your help!)"
3,"Interesting, like Floyd but lacks Gilmore's guitar",Good Floyd type music from Germany. I can see why they never really broke out...but they have talent. Just not a diamond like David Gilmore...which allows the songs to get a bit boring.
3,Pretty good first volume...stinky second volume,"I really like the first volume which takes material from their mid 70's period to early 80's. I might seek out some of these CDs like Oceans. The second volume is pretty bad with rather ordinary, boring songs. I tried to get into it but it left me with an empty feeling. The second volume is not prog, it's straight forward garbage. The first volume has some nice proggy moments with Floyd influences."
2,Not too technical,"Very light on modeling contrary to the book's title. This book would be a good overview for someone with zero knowledge. If anyone has seen a published book with good models included, please let me know."
1,Do not waste your money,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I was lucky to sell it on zShops for half of face value. Clearly, this guy has little or no experience with crederivs, and his weak command of English just makes it worse. While I think Nelken's book is also a little thin on material, and Tavakoli's book represents a somewhat dated view of the market, both are substantially more educational than this one. My own experience suggests that one is far better off to understand bond/loan trading first, plus some structuring and capital allocation. That is enough to figure out how to trade crederivs. All this hype about the insane risk in these things is crap - it's not substantially more risky than bonds, and people have been in that business for a long time. The only essential difference - counterparty risk - is not really addressed in any satisfactory manner anywhere."
4,Its good just not as good as the broadcast,This cd covers more of there career but the broadcast has the sound that most cutting crew fans want so this cd is good but not essential personally i prefer the broadcast all there major hits that the band is remembered by are on that cd. If you happen to like some of there latter hits and only want one cd then this ones for you if not buy the broadcast you will most likely be happier.
1,Bib,"I ordered this bib as a gift for my granddaughter. It arrived, finally, after a overly long journey from Canada. It was not as I expected it to be; it was very small and the fabric was not good quality."
1,Wouldn't buy again,"All the music on this CD is hokey synthesizers. I hadn't noticed it was from 1995, but as soon as I heard it I knew it was from the 90's. I erased it from itunes almost immediately, the songs just sound terrile. What a waste."
4,GTA San Andreas,"I think the game is well worth the money. Always something to do,and you can do what you want and don't have to go in any order."
3,This is great for Amazon,"While I think the new rating is fine (if redundant, with M being for adults only too- I mean really, 17 year olds can decapitate and mutilate innocent civilians all day long but not see ten seconds of fully clothed simulated sex??!!!).What bothers me, though, is that the stores just pulled it all from the shelves. This is the same problem with NC-17 films, which are not pornography but was intended to be a compromise for films too strong for an R rating, but the theatres won't show them. Hence the soft censorship of the lazy parents who terrorize businesses, the government and the rest of us to babysit their children for them.Amazon appears to be the only place to buy this game now, and I know people who are rushing to do so before this now out of print edition of the game disappears.About the game- for a normal person who can tell the difference between fiction and reality, it's fabulous."
1,Dont believe the 5* fanboys,"This is a lamentable game. Laughable graphics, repetitive language and foul at that. Generic characters populating the streets as in previous games and a unwieldy targeting system. Missions dont mean a thing if youve done it all in the previous incarnations of this game,still stealing taxis and cars, ie BORING!!!Its GTA again and again, nothing innovative or new. Talk about milking a franchise."
3,"Wow, very realistic!... very!","GTA 3 remains the best GTA game in the series. They should have kept the feel & graphics while adding new features to the game play. There was no place like liberty city.Then comes San Andreas... wow a super realistic game, where new game play makes it a pain to like. So its not as addictive anymore. You have to eat, keep fit and date. Man even buying weapons is such a laborious task. Wait... you even have to dress him up... like a doll. Cut his hair... yikes.On the bright side, the dialogue and the story are superb, except for a few unmatched missions e.g. where the thug i built had to fly rc planes. Overall good game - nothing special."
1,DONT BUY IF YOU HAVE VISTA,"I ordered this today and though it would work on my Vista Acer. Little did i know, every time i tryed to open it, it froze, Bottom Line, Dont buy if you have Vista"
5,I don't need to write a 30-page review for this game.,"I can sum it up in one word: Wow.This game is definitely your savior from boredom. You can do SO much in this game, and it will take up your time for hours... weeks... and months, in my case.Gta3 was great. Gta: Vice city was awesome. Gta: San Andreas is just plain amazing."
1,We didn't even get to play,"My father is an IT and has been for 20 years, when he downloaded this it crashed his computer and deleted many things off his computer, not once but TWICE. That said I will be nervous to download any games from Amazon or anywhere else. BUT Amazon was prompt at offering a refund and were very helpful after I called them, they said they haven't heard of it doing that. Maybe it was just us. Doesn't hurt my love for Amazon,...just maybe their downloadable sections."
2,"Boring missions, ugly graphics","I was hoping for an interesting simulation of ""real life"" in this game, with its world open to be explored. But I found the graphics poor (I have free games that look better), and the missions were really boring, like looking for and erasing some 20 graffitis all over one area of town."
3,slowwwww and it is not my computer,i have a awsome computer i play battlefield and i never had a problem with it but i download this game and it is suck it is too slow
3,Vice City was Better,"Vice City had better radio stations, better cars and less in game movies, but in SA you can skip them and visiual graphic is better. The City is so big it takes you forever to remember it, and your comp needs to work hard to keep it running nicely. (P4, 3.2Ghz, 1024MB, ATI X600 256MB). Overall the game is about the same story. Do your job and you will get to the end."
2,Not what I wanted from it.,"I bought this downloadable version of the game cause I didn't want to wait for the disc to come. plus it was easier to play. This is a great game and I love the GTA series, but they didn't have what I really wanted it for. I got it so I can download the MTA (Multi Thief Auto)to play online with friends. But the downloadable GTA doesn't not acknowledge the code file to downgrade the game to make it Multi-player usable. So if you want this game to play online with others, You Will Need the Disc for it.Still a great game to play, but not useful for what I wanted it for."
2,Becomes Boring After A While.,"The Gta series has been going stong for a very long time with the new one coming out soon (Gta 5) its been my favorite game but i was very disappointed with this one,Each mission is tedious and its all the same, For example your given a misson to pick up a package simple as that so you go and pick it up and then a buttload of enemines show up then once you killed them all you have to return the package So along the way of returning it you run into more enemines, Almost every mission is like this in a way, Your given a simple task that you must carry out and along the way it turns into something very very hard,I like a challenge as much as the next person but i also like a many diffrent thing put togather,It becomes very boring after a while of doing the same thing over and over and over again go to the location pick up the item fight the bad guys and return its all the same but the gta series still is good but i dont like this game."
3,"Cool concept, nice story very nice setting, but..........","This is definatly the best gta game out. There has been a big improvement from the previous versions, for one YOU CAN ACTUALLY SWIM IN THIS ONE!!!!! but the game is nothing new compared to part 3 and Vice City. If you played either part 3 or vice city then you already know what the game is like. I give it 3 stars because the game isnt all that different from its previous versions, that could be a good thing or a bad thing all depending upon how much you liked vice city or gta 3. I would of liked a cool slow cam feature (that would of been awesome) kinda like driver 3 which is an absolutaly horrible game, compared to this. In conclusion I WOULD NOT PAY OVER 40 BUCKS for this. Be patient and hopefully in a few months the price will drop."
3,"Great game, lots of bugs though.","Having played the predecessors, I thought this game would be just as crisp on my system. Well the graphics are pretty good with frame rates of 60+ except in certain areas where they drop down to the 30- range. The choppiness is annoying and didn't occur in Vice City like it does here. All you have to do is go to the gtaforum.com website and look at all the people having trouble with bugs in the game to realize this was not put together all that well. As someone else stated, the foul language almost becomes obsessive and overdone. The aiming and camera angles are not as good as the predecessors. Even the default controls (which of course I change) were not setup with a serious gamer in mind - I don't know who thought them up.Anyway, I'd still recommend the game, basically an upgraded expansion pack with lots of bugs though."
1,"Unplayable, crashes","This game is unplayable due to multiple crashes, despite my updates of graphic, sound and directx drivers. The game has not been adequately tested. This is despite six calls to customer service who recommended multiple various audio and graphics setting downgrades, deleting settings files, and shutting off every other program I have. I also had a very difficult time returning the game once it was opened, don't put yourself through this. I loved GTA 3 and Vice City, and was really looking forward to this game. Trust me, at least wait until upgrade patches are made before buying this game."
1,Definetly Not for Kids!,"I am very happy about this because I was watching the news once and I heard this game has changed from M Rated to Audlts only now. Basically Rockstar should not be blamed for this game, The person who purchased this game is the one who should be held responsible for buying it for themselves or their young ones! I mean if the Parents would've not been buying this game for their Kids alot We should not have this problem but now I heard that someone has decide to Sue Rockstar for buying this game to their Grand kids. So everyone please pay a bit more attention to the Ratings next time and Don't Buy this game for your Kids!"
1,Re:not worth the wait,"I dont want all of my reviews to sound bad, but when I played this at a friends house, I didn't care for it. My friend was all jazzed about it, but I don't know, I like games with action, etc, not just a game where you can go and whack someone over the head with a gun or something. Maybe I did not play the game far enough to enjoy it, but to me, there are better games out there."
1,DON'T BUY THIS FOR PC,"My PC far exceeds the recommended requirements and You can't see the people on the streets, all I get is outlines. you end up beating a guy next to a cop and....BUSTED OR, you end up beating a cop....BUSTED.Also, I have played this game for over 100 hours and I have never gotten past the 3rd level, (Lifes a beach)Why? The keyboard is way too slow to respond to the arrows when they are in the circle. The most I have been able to score is 1550 and you need 2500!!!!!!!There are no settings to adjust the sensitivity so this piece of $39 crap is sitting on my ""useless game shelf""Again DO NOT BUY THIS if you have a PC, I only hope the Playstaion and XBox is better"
2,games good but.....,after installing it jacked up the boot sequence on 2 xp machines.ntldr is missing is what comes up when you restart after install easy fix but still lame...
2,GTA is timeless,Easy to unlock hot coffee mod and easier to get into the feeling of L.A gangs and gangstas.If you've already played it bvack in the day worth another go.
1,"worked once, thats all. tried re downloading, still nothing.","very dissappointed. title says all.. worked once, thats all. tried re downloading, still nothing. although this is only 4 bucks, save yourself frustration and download steam. they sell it for 7.49 as of right now."
2,not for pc,"this just sucks the main person just keeps running around.He just keeps running and or walking which is controlled thru the key board.no fwd bike control,he won't peddle, but gos backwards quite well.Tryed different setups reloads and nothing worked.Atleast I bought it used and for not much money.Maybe ill find a fix and try it again later."
3,Much like Emma's life...,"... a slog through the beginning and middle, really great toward the end, uninteresting at the end.I was bored with both the story and the writing until about half way through the book. Suddenly the prose seemed to jump off of the page and the story swept me along. Like Anna Karenina, but not as good, this is a textbook example of fantasy and love addiction.I can't see anything here that a young person could relate to. I hope high school students aren't still being tortured by being required to read it."
5,This story will stay with you,"This book was a challenge initially, with many peaks and valleys to overcome. During the first half of the novel, Flaubert's overt word-painting on every trivial object nearly made me put it down. I marched on because there was a weird thread that kept telling me he was gathering for a big push. The second half of the novel was the most incredible description of this woman's self-destructive behavior in literature. I kept thinking, ""God, how far is she blindly willing to go."" Francis Steegmuller's translation captures the vernaculars and mood of Flaubert's intent. I compared three separate translations at the bookstore and read passages side by side to gauge the use of straightforward language. Steegmuller floored the rest; having sublimity the others did not posses. The book is on my shelf with pride."
2,Poor source of reference,"Having 'played' around with MSCS for 1 year now on NT4 I'm still looking for good sources of reference for this technology, and unfortuneatly this is not it! In a lot of cases his explanations are very basic, and a lot of his examples don't make sense, and in some cases have serious errors. There is also far too much information that is not relevent to MSCS (have 32 pages of a registry dump with little explanation is not very useful!) After waiting months for this book to appear I was disappointed at the content, particularly when it turned up without the CD"
4,Good primer and reference,"If you are currently running MSCS, you may find this book useful. Otherwise, look elsewhere.This book is invaluable to me for it's section on troubleshooting. Believe me, when you have trouble with your cluster, this is likely the only place you will find an answer, or perhaps a glimmer of a clue, without calling Microsoft and getting their so called engineers (more like web-knowledge-base users) some more job security.The section on clustering is good for a primer/refresher, and the installation section should ONLY be used as a guide in understanding why MSCS works. I would not recommend creating your first (or any) cluster with this section. You should KNOW how to create your cluster before doing so. DO NOT depend on a book to hold your hand on creating your cluster. LEARN this stuff any way you can, then when armed with sufficient understanding and skills, go for it."
3,"The book was adequate, but with at least one serious error.","I found the book to be of some use in my particular situation. It is a step above the manual that comes with the MSCS product. It has what I think is a serious error. Under ""Mastering the Cluster Administrator"", the author states that you can ""Add or evict nodes from the cluster"" with the Cluster Administrator. You can evict nodes, but you cannot add them back. You have to re-install the cluster software on the node to add it back to the cluster. Not fun. If you have no experience with MSCS this book can be of help."
4,Good ol' 80's hard rock,"Good chord based, kind of boogie rock from SWEDEN. Maybe a little AC/DCish at times. The vocalist has one of those raspy, spoken word deliveries that really adds the right amount of sleaze to the music. The kind of stuff we used to cruise around listening to in the great 80's. If you despise most of the hard rock/metal that is around today as much as I, then you may enjoy this album."
5,Fantastic picture quality and good sound,"This DVD can be used as a benchmark for your plasma monitor (or large-screen LCD).... and aside from the excellent photography and good sound, its actually a good movie....if you happen to like teenage films (and I do).Check the scene in the consulates mansion on the first date... particularly the honey bee in flight against thepink flower petals.... the ""frozen"" water of the sprinkler... the close-ups of the facesin the kitchen scene.... the rat scampering along the tiles.From the point of view of lighting, focus and high quality imaging itdeserves 5 starsI watch a LOT of movies... and I am also a professional photographer...trust me, this disc is just the thing you need to restore your confidencein your home theatre setup.... after watching all the ""other"" movies !!"
3,NOT TOO BAD...,"CLOCKSTOPPERS reminds me of an afterschool special, aimed at a teen audience but okay entertainment for we adults too.Jesse Bradford plays a young man who stumbles upon a watch that can stop time, which he finds amusing at first but then when corrupt government agent Michael Biehn comes after him, he finds himself in danger.The special effects are okay and Bradford and his fellow castmates appealing; it's all been done before and better, but this one's passable."
3,Fair afternoon special,"The concept is not original. You have seen this before many times from Twilight Zones to ""The Girl, The Gold Watch & Everything"" (1980). Some do it well as in ""Timestalkers"" (1987) and then there is this movie.Standard premise, misunderstood youth know better than parents. Yep and of course has to save sire from the evil bad guy that has gone amuck. Zack has Henry's (Michael Biehm) molecular watch and he wants it back. On the side father of Zack can be useful in completing project. So will Zack save his dad or will Francesca runoff to Tahiti with the bad guy?One plus is the presents of French Stewart; I guess they needed one actor in the movie. And for distraction purposes Paula Garcés."
3,That's what I get for thinking.....,"Since I haven't actually watched the movie, my review is based on grandkids response.They liked Spy Kids and were fascinated with ""stopping time."" Whether this Locke's concept was just too complicated or story line was but the kids didn't even stick it out to the end. Didn't pay a whole lot and maybe they will like it when they are a little older."
2,Skip it,"I can deal with things dumbed down for a preteen audience if they're well-executed, but when you throw in a rather unlikeable leading man I'm done. I watched about 20 minutes of it, but that kid is really annoying."
4,Classic Hemingway--you will like it,The book is about classic Hemingway comments and letters. It also provides insight into his writing techniques and thought on writing.
3,The Sun Also Rises,When I first started to read the book it was so boring i kept on almost asleep. But after reading the book. I thought the book was one of the most interesting books that I have ever read. i would probably read it again if i had to.The most interesting part in the book was when they were bull-fighting i that it was good.
3,"Interesting quotes, but nothing else to add value","Other reviewers have complained about the lack of substance in this book. I partially agree. What you have here is a compilation of everything Hemingway ever wrote about writing, excerpted and organized into 'chapters' like ""Work Habits"" and ""Characters"". This is a very quick read, and if you love Hemingway you will definitely enjoy the convenience of having these quotes collected into one place. However, the 'author' adds zero to the work; there is no editorial discussion about Hemingway's writing habits / philosophies, and that is a little disappointing. Overall, I don't regret this purchase; just don't expect more than it can give. This book is quite literally ""Ernest Hemingway on Writing"". Nothing more."
2,Disappointing,"This book is a composite of excerpts taken from Mr. Hemingway's other writings and are categorized under headings such as work habits, qualities of a writer, titles, etc. Each of these categories, however, are not direct discussions on each topic. They are rather paragraphs taken from selected letters or by-lines written to other people. There was very little that could be drawn from experience or thoughtful use. If you compare this to Stephen King's book, ""On Writing"", there is no contest. Mr. Kings book is 'hands-down', one of the best books I've read, both in helpful content and interesting narrative throughout."
3,Okay,"I had already read the collected letters of Hemingway, so had read a lot of what is in this collection. So it was of less use than it would have been because of that. Other passages were new to me, though, and very interesting. And if you've never read his collected letters, then this will be all new to you. Good for the Hemingway-phile."
4,pretty good study book,I found this book really helpful but I am not sure how up to date it is.. also kind of strange that the pictures in the chapters are in black/white but then have color copies in a photo section in the middle
5,Excellent product and over the top customer service,"This vendor highly recommended, especially for students in the Southeast. I am a Georgian, and they are close by in North Carolina. These people went out of their way to expedite delivery. The microbiology text book they advertised as ""Used,like new."" I thought I'd made a mistake purchasing a used book, but when it arrived (just in time for classes), there was no writing in the worksheet sections.The price was very reasonable. I have recommended this vendor to my fellow students in the med lab program at North GA Tech."
2,Good-Looking Actors: Not so Good a Movie,Some good-looking people in a poorly executed movie. The editing was bad and so was the sound. I thoroughly enjoy over-the-top slasher movies. I watched this one to the end only because some of the actors were hot. Not a complete disaster but close.
1,SHOOT THE RAVEN,What an awful horror flim that seemd to go no where. The acting is so bad and the plot is silly.
1,Do not meet description,"I purchased these 1"" tags last month because the description read that they fit all tagging guns. When I received them they did not fit my gun and I was not able to use them. When I tried to return them the seller was suppose to mail me a replacement and we never received it. In the future I am only going to buy tags that meet my specific gun. I would not suggest buying from this seller."
1,Oil and Vinegar set (not),"I never did get this product. They kept sending me a stupid little bowl instead of the set. Sent the bowl back and they sent me another stupid little bowl. I can't seem to make Amazon understand that what they are sending me is not an Oil and Vinegar set but, just a small bowl. It's like dealing with a vending machine. Nobody's home. It's just keeps spitting out the same wrong item over and over. Finally asking for my money back but, I don't hold out much hope in that either."
4,The smooth machine,"I have purchased and have used tile-cutters before but this one was exceptional,this machine cut 1/2"" x 13"" easily without breakages and the good thing about it it cost me drastically less than similar machines I personally vouch for this equipment and would recommend it to anyone any day. I hope there is lots more where this came from"
2,Doesn't do the job,"Cannot cut 16"" tile. I tried to cut my 16"" porcelain tile, it did a clean break 12"" down and the break veers off. I tried it again w/ the same problem. Then I decided to try a 12"", thinking that it was just mine that was defective, but it worked fine. I tried the 16"" once more and had the same problem. I looked under where the tile sits and I found out the protuberance below tile only goes up to 12"" and there's no support for it under the tile beyond that. From the other review it seems to cut 13"", but my guess is that it's probably not a good idea to try and use this on any tiles larger than that. I gave it two stars because it actually does cut 12"" tiles."
5,"AWESOME, best tool ever for cutting tiles!","Used for 12"" tiles. Worked like a charm. I will never ever go back to hand snippers! Minimal bad breaks and those were due to my own weak scoring."
3,OK product,I winded up not using this and buying a wet saw because I was cutting marble tile. I guess this is good for cutting ceramic tile.
4,"buy it, buy it, buy it!","This book is so not about ponchos and trend items...the patterns are BEAUTIFUL, and the variety of projects are fantastic! Everyone at my LYS is going wild over this one!"
5,Nice variety of shawl and wrap designs,"What I like about this book is that there is a wide assortment of designs, including lace, cables, rib, and color and they use a variety of yarn weights. The instructions state what kind of yarn the pattern uses as well as the yarn that the designers actually used to knit the pictured piece--this is especially useful if you are not good at guessing what yarn-weight something is made out of. Charts are also included as well as schematics. One word of warning is although the title states knit and crochet pieces, most are knit. Overall, excellent book."
4,Wrap style,"There are good patterns in this book, but I actually bought it for the directions for various techniques in the back. However, I found the text printed in gray instead of a sharp black and it was difficult to read for those with impaired vision."
2,Looking For Ponchos or Cape(lets)? Look no further!,"I anxiously awaited this book after being thoroughly impressed with Scarf Style. After seeing what this editor did with what can be thought of as something for a beginner (the scarf) I was really excited for Wrap Style.However, this book is really all about the poncho and cape/capelet. When I think of a wrap I think of rectangular and triangular shapes that drape over the shoulders and (silly me) wrap around. Most of this book's patterns fasten together and have a poncho or cape shape. There are a couple that are not in this category -- but they're few.If this book was called Poncho/Cape Style I would give it 4 or 5 stars. The patterns are nice -- it's the deceiving title that's problematic."
4,Excellent book on Wraps,"The patterns in this book run from simple for the advanced beginner to fun for the experts and are well written and easy to understand. For techniques and methods there are pictures - which make sense! - and in the back of the book is section explaining how to design your own wraps. For that section there are drawings and pictures of the different styles and explanations on how they work. Also, the patterns themselves are great and even include a felted capelet."
2,Disappointed: only 1 crochet pattern.,"The title says ""....to knit and crochet."" Since there are 24 styles, I thought 12 would be to crochet, NO. Only 1 pattern is to crochet. Since I don't know how to knit, I am disappointed. I may be able to recreate the knit patterns, but I shouldn't have to do that. They are still beautiful."
2,Not my taste - but it might be yours,"I have Lace Style by the same authors, and I love it. It's got a variety of innovative, wearable designs. Not every design is for me, but there is enough variety that I found several things I like, and I know my friends will find other things they like, etc.With this book, the styles mostly seem very similar, and they just don't appeal to me, except for one crochet style and one simple wrap.I also bought Wrapped in Comfort, which I love, it has light, airy, lovely circular shawls couple with stories I enjoyed reading. Plus I prefer knitting lace vs. intarsia or cables.I think, however, this might just be a matter of taste. If you think you'd like to make capelets, which are definitely in style right now, take a look at both books and see which suits your tastes better, and your knitting pleasure."
1,Interesting,"The book GOD WHO is more of a collection of essays than an integrated guide, with largely independent chapters on a scattered range of topics. Much of what the author writes consists of aphorisms or throwaway lines that don't withstand deeper consideration, turning out to be banal or just plain wrong. But, I must state that the book is one of the ""best word-for-word"" substitutes for the readings of other such biblical manuscripts out there today. The author, I believe, has indicated that there is a considerable degree of doubt in what religion as a whole has taught us. Few subjects arouse resistance and engender more confusion than Bible or religious talk. It's hard to know what to think, or what to do, when we're told these enchanting things by child molesters and other criminally minded people behind the pulpit. At least you can say that the author has exercised his editorial role very responsibly. Pity the poor tuba, for he gets no respect."
5,When Political Correctness was Politically Incorrect,"I love the Go Go Gophers, even as an adult. I enjoy the slapstick humor, though animated. It would never be broadcast today because it would be considered ""politically incorrect"", but people need to get a life and lighten up. This tape and ""The Best of Go Go Gophers"" are must-haves. You will laugh and so will your kids. I am over 50 and laugh like I'm a little kid again when I watch this. I'd give this MORE than 5 stars if that were an option."
5,&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;I,"This is an awesome CD!! Out of all of the eternal editions, this one is one of the best. Having all the Karaokes, and the most recent sailor moon, Kuroki Marina! (*-}i) the new cast for the myu Tanjo! Ankoku Princess Black Lady -Kaiteban- sings the other songs, the best inculding Traditional the Grace and Drive me the Mercury. This also includes the instrumentals and orgel for songs such as Link, La Soldier, and La Moon. If you love myu, you have to get this. It has all the best songs on it!! Great CD!!"
5,Mi primer caset de Sodom,"Definitivamente SODOM irrumpió la escena metalera a nivel mundial con un gran ep llamado The Sign of Evil que fue justamente lo primero que escuché de los alemanes. Personalmente es el disco que más me gusta. Mas que una apreciación objetiva, es una apreciación llena de emoción pues era adolescente cuando escuché por primera vez.Persecution mania, gran disco un cambio a la crudeza demostrado inicialmente pero con mucha fuerza y grandes riff, gran preambulo para una joya que llegaría despues ya saben a que disco me refiero.SODOM se presenta mañana 16 aca en Lima... OUTBREAK OF EVIL"
5,Christmas music,"I love receiving my holiday ,would highly recommend this company to anyone. the music helped make my ride to work and enjoying it in my home during the holiday was great. I shared the ideal that I ordered it from Amazon to everyone at my job."
4,Required text for course,This text was required by a professor in one of my graduate level courses. This has provided a helpful overview of the grant writing process and provided a framework from which I can work to develop skill in this area.
3,Proposal That Works,The book was okay but did not help me quite like I thought it would. I guess I was looking for more detail on how to write each section of a proposal
4,Proposals that work expensive text books,Proposals that work is an expensive text books. I bought it new and it arrived in a couple days for a cost..
2,OK if you've never written before,This book is very general and I guess is good if you have never written any sort of scientific paper.
3,good length but poorly made...,these are ok wraps they are nice in long but started to curl in almost immediately. Thought washing would help but it only made it worse and caused the edge to begin to fray. Not sure if this is common as this is my first set of wraps but I guess for me I was surprised. I had hopped they would hold up better. I have now taken to ironing them after washing them and only washing them inside a pillow case to avoid the fraying getting worse.
2,Not near the quality expected of Portmeirion,I have purchased Portmerion glassware in the past but these glasses do not come close to the same quality. The handpainting is poorly done and reflects the fact that they were painted in China. The colors do not even match what is displayed on the box. I was very disappointed. The paint looks slapped on giving the glasses a cheap look. Not something you would expect from Portmeirion.
4,"Some indie favorites, a good live album.","For fans of the indie music scene this is a great live album. There are some great cuts on here by groups like Keane, Kasbian, etc. This festival has gotten bigger and bigger each year, it's interesting to see who was there a few years ago, who's still around and who isn't.Matt Zarnstorff"
3,Way overpriced and restrictive terms,"I have to agree with M - this is a rip. I only want one song from this album, but I had to buy the whole thing to get it. (check the listing for the actual CD rather than the digital download version - you'll get a much better price, particularly if you buy a used one)I'm not paying four or five times as much for MP3 files when I can create all the MP3 files I want from the CD."
5,Excellent Resource!,"A practical step by step hands on approach to the world of consulting. This book contains all you need to know to start, maintain and manage a successful consulting business."
5,"Step-by-step, your ""trip-tik"" to consulting success!","Elaine has obviously learned many lessons on the ins and outs of getting a consulting business to succeed in these very competitive times. The book is a blend of self-analysis, practical tips, and insights into managing a one-person operation. If this is all so much common sense, why hasn't anyone written this book before? Elaine has the ability to do the work and, at the same time, to analyze the work as she's doing it. The information on the disk really makes all of the business side so much easier. A must read for consultant wannabees."
5,"Insightful, user friendly, relevant, great layout.","The Business of Consulting effectively addresses the host of questions that need to be asked and answered before taking the huge step of leaving your current, stable, dependable position and going out on your own. The book is extremely well written and organized. It reads easily, in large part because of the first person usage. It's a very enjoyable and useful book."
1,It's a waste of money even for beginner,"Sure this book is only for beginner or outsider of Cosulting business. But then, for the price of this book, I would rather buy a much cheaper book but with more useful information and ideas - such as Consulting for Dummies. The book is full of motherhood statements and it is more liked written by a grand mom and she called herself consultant; But come on, Consulting is a highly skillful business that require structural, systematic yet creative thinking. Overall, I think this book is a waste of money for experienced consultant. While for beginner, the reader will risk the wrong impression that it's this easy to win a consulting work - highly unlikely in a complex and competative world."
3,Good quality book on the basics,"To be honest I was somewhat disappointed with this book, but only because my expectations were set to high based on these reviews! I have read many books on consulting and must of them have very little in the way of valuable content. This is well written and does give useful information. What disappointed me was the lack of depth. The title `the basics & beyond' should have been only `the basics'. Most of the examples and items included in the disc are VERY introductory and simplex. The sections of the book dealing with marketing were good - but could have been much more comprehensive.If you a just thinking about consulting or are new to consulting the book would be great for you. If you have a successful consulting business already - you most likely could have written this book yourself."
4,"Good book, but...","I'm an internal Jr Consultant in Telecommunications for a large company in my country, and although this is a good book (GREAT advices), I'm disappointed like Mr Morris because I was expecting more of it based in the reviews.Maybe ""Consulting - the basics"" covering more on the internal consulting side and less on the business side would be better for future editions."
1,Very light on content,"This disappointing book skirts the issue of consulting and instead uses generic advice about building any business. It consists of laundry lists, not usable advice. Bottom line: This will not help anyone build a consulting business."
5,Quintessential Cash,"This hand-selected collection of vintage Cash tunes...selected by Johnny himself...paints a vivid picture of the values, vices, virtues, pleasures, and pains that shaped not only Johnny's life, but America's. Several of Johnny's best-known tracks are included, such as ""Suppertime,"" ""The Ballad of Ira Hayes,"" ""Man in Black,"" ""Ragged Old Flag,"" and ""Wanted Man,"" but all of the tracks here--the hits and the lesser-known gems--ring true. Johnny sang for us all: the loners, the lovers, the losers, the lost...and the miraculously found. His voice, full of strength, pathos, righteous indignation, mirthful mischief, tender mercy, and prophetic honesty, stands front and center, accentuated by stellar but spare instrumentation. This continuation of the outstanding LOVE, GOD, & MURDER boxset, is a worthy addition to that collection, but also stands alone by itself as a priceless document of American songcraft at it's finest."
5,Life is Good,"The God/Murder/Love and now Life series is probably the best way to organize a compilation of Cash's work. (To my way of thinking, though, as great as Johnny Cash is, there are far too many Best of's, Greatests, etc.) What makes this collection noteworthy is that Cash compiled the list. Owning nearly every CD and much vinyl, I don't really have a reason to buy another compilation; however, coming from Cash, this disc is unique. It is a kind of musical biography. That said, it is, in the final analysis, just another collection of, admittedly, one of rock/folk/country's finest musicians."
1,Very Misleading,"This Cd has been a big disappointment. Some tunes are cut off before they end. There are no notes as far as recording dates and locations, even if they are live, the the cover states this is ""The Band Of The Army Air Forces and the American Band Of The AEF when, in fact, alsmost all can be identified as the civilian band. There is one intro to the AEF band but that is it. Finally, what is ""Blues For the Big Band"".... I'd love to know.Again, very disappointing."
5,An Excellent Collection of Essays on Modern Poetics,"""Working Time"" is an exceptional collection of essays on modern poetics from one of America's best young poets. Part of the University of Michigan's renowned series (Poets on Poetry), this book sheds light on the politics of poetry, the role of the poet in society, and the challenges confronting American poetry at the turn of the century. Her understanding of the technical elements of free verse and her ability to convey ideas lucidly and without pretense make this an outstanding collection for both the serious poet and fan alike."
1,OPEC and Natural Gas,Learsy was touting his book on C-Span last night. He did not present any scientific evidence for his opinions. He made no attempt to correct audience statements such as 'most of the Alaskan oil is shipped to Japan'. He did not address the imminent natural gas crisis. The cost of natural gas has gone up more than gasoline. Does Learsy belive that OPEC controls production of natural gas in the US?
1,WOW! This is REALLY Bad!!,"Examples:""*I* was there! I drove them home! I kept them safe!""""Here is the corssing at Abbey Road. Thousands of people have walked across it and now I am going to walk across it."" <camera follows him walking across Abbey Road>""John, Paul, George and Ringo, I pledge my loyalty to you, always.""It really is that bad! I wish I could rate this one a negative star."
2,ALF BICKNELL'S PERSONAL BEATLES DIARY!,"Before you see this DVD you will be asking the QUESTION: ""Who is Alf Bicknell""? After you see this DVD you will be asking the QUESTION: ""Who cares about Alf Bickenell?"" For TWO-YEARS good old Alf was the Beatles' DRIVER and ROAD MANAGER! Thrilling, huh? You get to see a party with the ROLLING STONES! You get to see the BEATLES in the studio and on the road! But every once in a while there is some ORIGINAL FOOTAGE by PAUL McCARTNEY! That has to be worth something! But you also get a lame interactive TRIVIA section! If you are an absolutely die-hard BEATLES FAN and you have NOTHING ELSE in the world to buy about the FAB FOUR, then you can pick up this one! Otherwise, since you already know who ALF BICKNELL is, why bother?"
3,For Beatles Freaks Only,"Alf was the Beatles chauffeur, and so experienced the Beatles day-to-day as few did. But his stories are VERY minor stories, generally, and they often don't have much of a pay-off. But if you're a Beatles freak, as I am, even the most incidental anecdotes are of interest. He tells of trivial moments, and he is a rather shy man, which is actually rather refreshing, because most people you see on camera are overly slick. There aren't any great Beatles clips...a few here and there. It shows a clip of Paul at a solo-show, mentioning to the audience that Alf is in the audience, that is fun to see. And Alf relates when the Beatles once stole four bottles of milk! Also he gives details about when the Beatles met Elvis (Alf was there). And while most Beatles fans have seen the Beatles homes/hang outs in photos, to see them on video gives you a better sense of what they look like. This is a modest effort, but its modesty is part of its charm."
1,utter crap,"Don't even consider buying this crap. Alf is trying so hard to cash in on the Beatles, it is rediculous. Alf retells his really pointless stories while the viewer looks at crappy stock footage. You get to see Paul solo for a few minutes but that's about it. I am a die hard Beatles fan who thought there wasn't any bad Beatles related merchandise. This video proved me wrong."
3,Pretty Darn Good,"3 1/3 for sure. I'll tell you what, for the insider it is a very interesting Video, He tells lots of stories of The Beatles, Mal Evans & Neil Aspinal themselves, Maybe he was trying to make a buck, But I would pay to sit and listen to a road manager tell their stories as well as I paid this bloke, tell his, which were pretty goodLike the story where he didn't strap down a Banjo correctly and John says if you find the banjo you'll get a bonus or when a police man thought Alf Bicknell stole The Beatles car and Alf had John Lennon step out of the car and the policeman just walked away dumbfounded & many more. I think it was interesting for those who like the inside story's, Yes no real Beatles music but it's a great videoBut don't take my word for it, YOU GOTTA SEE IT.Chewy"
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....,I was given the VHS of this title several years ago.It's got nothing much to offer the avid Beatle fan. Some trivial stories and uninspired vignettes from The Beatles' former chauffeur.I guess he needed some quick $$$.
1,Absolute rubbish!,"Poor old Alf says he kept quiet about his Beatles involvement from 1966 to 1989. It's a pity he didn't leave it that way.This video is so poorly directed and edited that it is not clear whether you are in Liverpool, London or USA at any given time.Alf MUST have had some interesting memories from three years with The Fabs, but they're not recorded here ... John pinched a bottle of milk, there was a large crowd at Shea Stadium etc.At least half the footage is filled with Alf plodding along a street somewhere, plus many clips from Paul's world tour. (Relevance? Alf went to one concert and Paul spoke to him...)Most of the anecdotes are rehashed (George Harrison didn't like George Martin's tie) and there is little here to interest even a serious Beatles fan.Spend your money elsewhere!"
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....,I was given the VHS of this title several years ago.It's got nothing much to offer the avid Beatle fan. Some trivial stories and uninspired vignettes from The Beatles' former cheauffeur.I guess he needed some quick $$$.
2,Kind of OK,"This DVD is OK in the information dept. Lots of re-hashing of the age-old Beatle tail, but this fellow was there for a chunk of it all. Drove them around, brought them their dinner, runner- go-fer, drove them up to met Elvis. On the sideline but a fairly interesting side and your glad he survived it, some didn't. His tour of Liverpool is quaint and silly but it's the most I've seen of the place in one sitting. This DVD also obviously has a fairly large endorsement by McCartney. He's let Alf use segments of his solo music as background as well as snippets from what looks like early 90's live footage. Pretty nice of Paul helping out his old driver. I would recommend this to the more hardcore fans to add to your library."
5,Great!,"I have become a GVB fan in recent years and bought this CD because of ""Lord Feed Your Children"". I was not familiar with the lead singer on here but after listening to this CD several times since receiving it on Thursday it has become one of my favorites. Love the up-tempo stuff, their wonderful harmonies and the change of pace with ""Build An Ark"". This CD shows the incredible range of talent that Bill Gaither has managed to assemble over the years as he keeps re-creating his group."
3,"Slow, Slow, Slow","All I can say is that I was not impressed at all by this novel. This was my first novel by Philip Luber. It was very short and very lacking. Harry, a psychiatrist and Veronica, his girlfriend and FBI agent are trying to discover who killed Veronica's mom 20 YEARS AGO! Veronica is bored so she just happens to wait 20 stinkin years to try and figure out who killed her mother. At the end, I was not impressed who Mr. Luber portrayed was her killer. I felt it should have been someone who was in the novel throughout the whole time. I won't say that this novel is bad at all, it is just quite slow and tiresome at times!"
5,Unbelievable Sea Yarn!,"As a sailor in the Western Pacific, I wouldn't dream of making up a sea story this over the top. This is simply put, the most amazing tale of the sea I have ever read. Count Von Luckner ran away to sea as a youth, hunted kangaroo in Australia, served in the Mexican Army, was a professional wrestler,...oh yeah... he also took charge of a highly modified schooner in WWI and laid waist to Allied shipping between America and Europe. He recieved Germany's highest war-time awards as well as being decorated by his advesaries and recieving a humanitarian award from the Pope. A truly incredible man who lived in a dynamic time. A must read for any lovers of adventure, the sea, or World War I."
5,A Robot Anime that wont disappoint. GGGoooooo Dannar!!!!!!,"At first glance, especially the box and DVDs, it looks like some pervo anime. I was hoping to God when I bought it, that it wasn't going to suck. To my surprise, I was jumping out of my seat on the first disc. This thing is action packed and awesome to watch. If you are a robot/fighting anime lover or just love anime period this is for you. The story line is excellent the visuals are awesome. You dont have to honestly understand the plot to get the point. This is one of those miracle animes that does exactly what the fans want and expect from it. It will even do some unexpected stuff and cause your jaw to drop. The girls may be a distraction at times, but never long enough for you to forget about the fighting and the robots. Its almost as if you could feel every hit or punch that was made when you watched. 5 out of 5 all the way man."
2,Cute but lacking depth,"This is a book for someone who has take Latin and wants a casual and rather cutsey flashback but it's not really that good for learning the language on your own. A better choice would be Peter Jones's ""Learn Latin"", of which there are still quite a few knocking around, or if you really want a thorough grounding, Wheelock or the Oxford course.You should not expect to be able to read an ancient text after working your way though this book."
4,"An excellent introduction, entertaining and informative","The brothers Humez introduce the principles of Latin prosein an entertaining way - for instance, one of the sampletranslation exercises turns out to begin ""A bear walked intoa bar ..."" Information-packed, yet never heavy."
3,"An appetizer, not the main course","This book may whet the appetite of someone curious about the way Latin functions. It's an antipasto, not the main course. It will not help anyone to read real Latin, but it may entertain and intrigue some enough to start them on the hard work of learning the language for real."
3,You need a teacher,"I have a great desire to learn the Latin language and was hoping to get a head start for my high school course. Latin is a complex language if you don't have an experienced teacher to explain in-depth the structure of correct Latin. While learnign the endings is not so hard, it's more using all of the endings in nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs in a correct fasion. This book scantily explains these, thus making it difficult to correctly piece together sentances. It also throws complicated items such as the declension of duo, duae, ambo, ambae etc. I would reccomend this as a simple review or an experienced student..."
3,"Interesting, but not a way to learn latin","Well written, entertaining, witty, but an effective tool for learning latin? Maybe not. It's more of a grammar summary than a course, jumping straight into declensions and conjugations, usually for rather silly words like ""adulterer"" or ""lay waste"". It has some value as a review, or complement to some other resources, but does not stand on its own.I also found the excersizes (the usual translation style) to be very tedious. It makes latin feel like a sudoku puzzle rather than a language.There are some really nice passages on language change, ancient music, etc."
1,Mistranslation in Title Means Lack of Precision Inside,"The phrase ""Latina pro populo"" should not be translated ""Latin for People,"" as though the Latin word ""populus"" in the singular is a synonym for our plural word ""people"" (equivalent to ""persons""). The Latin word is a singular designating the totality of the populace, as in ""We the People."" The plural of this word is ""peoples,"" as in ""the peoples of sub-Saharan Africa."" Therefore, the phrase should be translated precisely as ""Latin for a/the People."" This kind of sloppiness in the name of gaining accessibility inevitably breeds lacks of clarity inside. I would look for a different textbook.--Dr. Robert Zaslavsky, retired teacher of Latin"
1,Not what you think,I thought this was a good deal for a slip cover for my ipod shuffle; however when it arrived it was made up-side down. You cannot put it on the shuffle correctly. Don't waste your money.
4,Cute 'n Chunky,"Good pictures of kittens with unbelievably cute names. Not something you're necessarily going to read to your kids, but a good book for a young child to flip through on his or her own. My one year olds like it."
3,it was OK...,"I listened to this album once and found two really good songs: ""Big House"" and ""We're A Band"". Everything else...well, was iffy at best. If you want truly great Audio Adrenaline, pick up ""Some Kind of Zombie"" or ""Live Bootleg"". This one is OK if you are an AA fanatic."
5,Great sound and message - geared to young people,"I find this CD to be good for anyone who wants to hear pop-rock with good lyrics.In particular, I think this Audio Adrenaline recording speaks to kids/teens with songs such as Can't Take God Away, A.K.A. Public School, My World View, Big House, Don't Censor Me.These bring good messages to young people when so much music is littered with destructive lyrics. Go pick one up for yourself (or your kids)."
4,Big House i think is the best song!,I say that the best song AA has ever wrote and song is Big House. Their is something about it that not just me but everybodie likes.
1,Samsung over the ear headset - a piece of junk,"The title says it all. Poor quality, poor construction, poor fit, almost impossible to hear out of it. I strongly suggest you don't buy it."
1,THIS CD WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME.,WHEN I BOUGHT THIS CD I HAD GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT IT MIGHT BRING. AFTER REVIEWING IT I WAS DEFLATED. I THOUGHT HOW COULD A BIG BAND CD HAVE SUCH BAD ARRANGING. I GUESS ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. THIS HAS TO BE THERE WORST CD. OUT OF ALL THE TRACKS LISTED I LIKED 2 SONGS.
5,Great swing music!,Spitfire Band has done it again. Wonderful style! Great renditions! Listening to it makes you feel like you're back in the forties.
3,"Feit Electric 45R20/MP-130 45-Watt R20 Flood Mini Reflector Bulb, Frosted, 6 Pack","Feit Electric 45R20/MP-130 45-Watt R20 Flood Mini Reflector Bulb, Frosted, 6 PackBulbs arrived promptly but with one broken filament, which increased the per-bulb cost. (Box arrived with Sealed Air bags completely deflated - reported to Packaging Feedback). Still, the price was significantly less than name brands available locally. Have had no experience with this brand so I can't say how long they'll last compared with others."
2,Did not meet my expectations,"I bought these 9 months ago for 4 light sockets in my kitchen controlled by a dimmer switch. Currently only 3 of those 6 lights still work. I am under the impression that I should get longer bulb life due to using 130 volt bulbs in a 120 volt house and that dimmed lights don't consume their life span as quickly. In my experience these bulbs have not performed any better than any regular light bulb from my local hardware store. Other than my expectations not being met, these bulbs seem as disappointing as any other normal bulb."
1,First bulb stopped working after 15 minutes,First bulb I installed stopped working after 15 mins if use. Second one I installed has worked ok thus far. Not overly satisfied given faulty bulb
5,Great!,"These bulbs last very long, and it helps me to save some money on replacing light bulbs. I definitely will come back to get these bulbs for next time. Thanks!"
5,Bring all the good memories of the beach home with you!,"We have friends who live at the beach, who always have this hand soap next to their sinks. I LOVE the smell of it! The hand soap leaves your hands clean, yet soft & smelling wonderful! This is definately worth the cost!! Check it out on the product web page (http://www.goodhomeco.com/) & discover all the wonderful smelling products they carry! But buy here at Amazon, because the price is better!"
2,The Wrong CD,"This is not the original Columbia CD. It is a re-issue on the KRB label using the same title but with different tracks,it contains the same tracks as the King label ""Best of the Best"" which is much cheaper. FYI"
1,My Life as a Fake,"I'm sorry, but I just could not finish this book (something I haven't done in probably ten years), so maybe it's not fair that I'm offering an opinion. In any case, after the first 100 or so pages, I found that I did not care a bit about any of the characters and I found the protagonist to be particularly unlikable. Maybe if you are really interested in poetry and poets, the developing intrigue may interest you, but I'm not, so it didn't."
2,Heartlessly left in the dark.,"The novel's premise is that Australian poet Christopher Chubb perpetrates a literary hoax; he invents a new persona, Robert McCorkle, and submits pretentious poetry to a novice editor. The editor, who Chubb resents, publishes the work and is humiliated when the hoax is revealed. The reader is in for a bizarre twist when Robert McCorkle appears in the flesh and is a gifted poet.How is this possible? Who is lying, who is insane? Years later, this enigma confronts the narrator, editor of a poetry magazine. The editor has no empathy for the pathetic Chubb or the monstrous McCorkle; she only wants to read McCorkle's damn poetry. Well, good luck! The narrator and reader are both ready for a nervous breakdown at the book's conlusion. We are left to our own conclusions in this strange and unfulfilling story."
2,Really Tried,"I really tried to like this book better, but I simply couldn't get past the excruciating tediousness of the first 200 pages. I couldn't connect with any of the characters, and the theme of author as creator has been done much better, especially by Paul Auster. Furthermore, Mr. Carey seems to be fixated on reviving fictional/non-fictional people as characters, and after three books, this approach becomes boring."
4,Left Thinking,"This book started out fascinating. I was gripped from page one and wanted to know what would happen. I enjoyed the images the writing brought to me. The flow is wonderful and enjoyable. I did not give it 5 stars simply because the ending left me a little unsettled. I wanted to KNOW. I realize that this is pretty much the only way to end this book but still, I really was hoping for a small hint as to what was that creature, exactly? In the end, I think this is a wonderful read."
2,disappointed,"I have been a fan of Peter Carey since reading Oscar and Lucinda ten years ago, and have enjoyed every story since (Jack Maggs was a gripper!), but this one was work to get through. The only reason I trudged through the book was because I had faith that Mr. Carey would deliver. At some points, I thought he was close...I was interested, and ready to be excited. But then, once again, something irritating happened (chubb was caught; he meets someone whose past MUST be explained in detail; the editor's own family drama;etc.) which made it such a chore. The ending was anti-climactic.I, too, felt like I was reading a galley. Oh well, you can't win 'em all! I'm sure he'll do better next time."
2,A let down,It could have been so much better. Seems like they started with a good idea then fell asleep so their pre-teen sons finished it.
3,some things not noted,"She had several bottles of pills and she is seen taking a cap fill, which Isuspect has to do with her paranoia.I found the ending rediculous, she all blood splattered and no one asks her what happened.She takes a cab to the airport. She obviously has no money, no passport, no handbag.REDICULOUS!!"
4,"Good mindless, gory fun with your friends on a friday night","Though this flick is far from a masterpiece, and it has more nudity than most movies, it is fun, and somehow manages to make a girl running around mazes for an hour good. The first 85 minutes are whatever, fine, mediocre, you know. Then, the big twist comes and although *very minor spoilers* you kind of saw it, it still is shocking, and what happens in reaction is really ""WHOA""! My jaw had dropped to the floor. Be sure to get soem funny movie to watch afterwaqrds, because although it is a good FUN horror movie, it still is a little depressing and (although the two are COMPLETELY different, the enidng has a bit of a ""May"" feel)(2002, Angela Bettis & Anna Faris.) 3.5 stars."
1,Don't Like This Movie,I absolutely did not enjoy anything about this DVD it is rated R and that I must of overlooked because I never would of bought it. I began to watch about 5 minutes into the movie and threw it away. It is poorly made the picture and sound is crazy. I watched the previews of the other movies the same company puts out and they were just as bad. I will not recommend this movie to anyone! Trash the idea folks..sorry.
3,Mindless entertainment,"This movie explores the catacombs under Paris where millions are buried. A young American girl visits her sister in Paris where they go to a party in the catacombs. Some gore and violence but it plays on our fear of the dark and someone lurking in it. It draws suspense using lighting from only a flashlight and the visiting girl being lost when she's separated from her sister. It has a good twist at the end, but the director rehashes the scenes at the end to dumb down this simple plot. This was probably meant to clarify the story but was unnecessary and will irritate most movie goers.Overall, it's a fun movie and both my husband and daughter enjoyed it."
4,Thrilling Chase,"This is a edge of your seat chase thriller, with a twist. I particularly enjoyed watching Alecia Moore acting in this. She did an excellent job and I would love to see her do more."
4,WTF is up with these mediocre reviews??,"I am a horror movie junkie and have seen it all...from cheese to Hall of Fame efforts in this genre. Catacombs is up there as being a well done horror flick that required little gore to be an effective and memorable movie in the hit or miss category of scary movies. I could care less that Alicia Moore aka Pink did this movie. Being that she did, the pop star stole the show. So did Shannon Sossamon. For some, that's all you need to know. For two sole characters to carry a movie to the limit this one did speaks volumes to me. Beyond that, the backdrop for this movie is a horror show within itself. Tunnels under the streets of Paris where the bones of those past rest? I'm not sure what else one would need to find this movie top notch."
3,Really surprised by the negative reviews,"Granted Pink isn't Judy Dench, but who is? I thought her performance was well done for what it was. The real problem for me was the fake minatour who was chasing the skinny sister around, he was wearing timberland boots, I guess she was too busy screaming and running to notice that a real minatour would probably not be wearing boots."
3,Review of Catacombs,"I love, love, love P!nk (Alecia Moore), but was still pleasantly surprised by her acting chops. The whole premise of the story has great potential, but I thought the overall production was really poor. There is a bit in the end where there is a voice over for Alecia Moore's character, but it clearly isn't her voice. This same voice over then proceeds to hop between Alecia's voice and the stand-in's. Clever twist at the end. Pity about the sloppy editing and production."
3,"Good, Not Great","I'm a HUGE fan of Pink's (Alecia Moore) so when I found out about this movie, I had to see it. I think she did a great job with the acting, the movie itself was alright, good amount of gore, lol! Make sure theres no little ones around, with the good amount of cursing. I'd recommend people to see it."
1,How the heck do you get this movie to play?,"Is there an easter egg? I felt like I was trapped in the Catacombs. I have bought this movie 3 times from 3 different stores. All I can get it to do is play the Lionsgate logo and trailers. I have tried 2 different DVD players, and 3 copies of the movie. I can't believe I am the only one having this problem!Whenever I try to get the menu, it goes back to the disclaimer about the commentaries."
3,"Pink Stinks, but...","I thought this was fun. For a moment I thought it might be over the top gross horror, but then it's just kind of funny. All the running around underground left me holding my breath waiting for goatboy to return. Alecia Moore is a horrible actress and should stick to whatever else it is she does."
4,I pre-booked and bought this dvd,"I've been a fan of P!nk's for a long time and when I heard about this movie I was stoked.I've heard a lot of ppl say P!nk sucked at acting. Personally I did find one line that sounded like she didn't know what she was saying, but other than that she was acting like herself. She says F*ck a lot and doesn't care if she's a bitch, thats P!nk and that's why we all love her ;) If you own her concert dvd's u'll understand.Victoria (co-star her sister) is annoying as hell. I'll give that actress one thing, she did do her part very well.The plot and set was also something new. It's ""Saw"" meets ""The Descent""So yah its not an award winning movie, it's one of those ones u pull out of ur collection to freak ur friends out because they've never seen it.So how is being different being bad? I'm happy with my purchase."
2,not all that great,this movie looked good when i saw the trailer and i knew it was done by the same people who produced saw which is a movie i like so i decided to give this one a try and it really wasnt good. first of all its so dark you cant see much and the camera is always moving it seems and there were 3 times the screen went black for no reason taking up time. it really wasnt gory like some people have said. maybe one gory part but its not even that bad. i wont give it a one star cause ive seen much worse movies and the location was good and it was original. it had kindof a creepy feel to it knowing that could happen and someone could get lost down there. rent it if there is nothing else to rent
2,disappointing purchase,"first of all, the position of the inflation valve is in a very awkward spot which makes it very difficult to inflate. plus, since the valve is in that spot, you can't inflate it very much because your face get in the way. the other problem is the suction cups, which don't come off so you can't remove the cover to wash it (the whole reason i bought this pillow), and they don't stick to the tub, so the pillow keeps floating off."
1,Wrong pieces,"The dairy barn kit came with the totally wrong pieces and instructions. I need to return it. We're missing 14 pieces we need to build the barn, as far as we can tell. Everything came in zip-top bags, too, meaning, I think, that it was returned by someone else at some point."
5,Happy,"I got the O scale Dairy Barn (I ordered the O scale, and meant to get the HO scale) for my dad and he is Pleased...even if it was the wrong scale, he will still use it.It is everything that he thought it would be.Thank YouMelissa"
1,This is the 85-minute version. Very disappointed.,"I'm a huge fan of ""Fugitive Girls"" (aka ""Five Loose Women"") and have anxiously awaited the DVD release for ten years or more. While this DVD is superior in audio and video quality to the multiple VHS versions I own, it is missing a total of five minutes! The sex scenes are cut down to nothing, which is a real shame because they contain some magnificently cheesy dialog and acting, and their absence really takes away from the powerfully trashy experience that is ""Fugitive Girls"". It is likely that the best-looking source print this company was able to find was missing these scenes, but I would have liked them to say so somewhere on the DVD. It's a rip-off."
1,The artist can't sing,"Do yourself a favor and buy the ORIGINAL artist's versions of all these songs. These are remade by a DJ and his singing is horrible while at the same time hilarious. Just listen to I Like To Move It for example. He tries to sound like the real artist and it just comes off bad. This CD could be called ""THE WORST OF AMERICAN IDOL"" because the songs are that poorly sung."
3,THIS IS A CD THAT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD.,"THIS IS THE SECOND STANTON BAND CD THAT I HAVE BOUGHT. IT IS BETTER THAN THE FIRST CD. THIS CD INTODUCES THE CLARNET IN IT'S ARRANGEMENTS. IT REALLY SOUNDS A LOT LIKE BENNY GOODMAN'S MUSIC, WHICH I LIKE. OUT OF 16 SONGS I LIKED 9."
3,not exactly accurate,"I enjoy an in depth review of an interesting an for the most part inacessible culture unless you are jewish. What this book lacks is an in depth look at the cultural relations in williamsburg with other ethnic groups. I have live in williamsburg for 10 years and recall so many conflicts with the hasidic community who is flourishing by buying out property from the latino community. The jews described here are spiritual but the ones I have encountered are rude,racist and sexist."
5,Works like a charm!,"I tried another manufacturers iPod product and was not able to get it to work. Every 15 minutes it would pause the iPod.So, I landed this little unit and it works great! Displays this artitst and track name, but it doesn't scroll the entire name, just the first 8 letters or so. No big deal. It works, which is more than I can say for the other manufacturer.Completely happy with the purchase. It is great to have 1000+ songs at your fingertips."
1,Palmiero and the Ogre,"At first, the book seems very child-friendly, however, as the story progresses, the plot becomes complicated. I do not like that the stick beats the innkeepers and Palmiero states,""The beating will not stop until you tell me where they (the jewels)are."" This seems to encourage violence and I do not think it is very appropriate for a children's picture book geared towards very young children."
3,I wish it was free,"I have enjoyed DC talks music for years. I got this album because I had a few of their others. This one was a suprise. It wasn't what I was expecting. THis album is 90's hip-hop. The album is worth the price for Lean on Me, and Jesus is just alright."
4,Simple...,This CD is one of the early DcTalk Albums...its a classic and i really liked it when i had it.
3,Got what I wanted,"I heard a song on a local public radio station and really liked it so I found the cd on Amazon.I love the song I wanted but the rest of the album, not so much. Thank you amazon for having what I was looking for."
4,Fun n Funky,"This is a really upbeat, fun album from dc Talk's earlier days. I really like the song ""Luv is a verb"", ""Time Is"", and ""Lean On Me,"" (a real cool version of the song). ""That Kinda Girl"" has an almost ""Soul Decision"" type sound, and ""The Hard Way"" has a verrrry funky beat."
4,very good but........,"This is a very awesome c.d. I love all the songs except 1 and i love all the intercludes except 1.The song i don't like is i don't want it.I wouldn't have s-e-x even if i were married!The interclude i don't like is 2 honks and a negro.It's funny,but to me it is wrong.How is it christian?You might want to listen to the sound clips before you buy this,and see what you think about this.god bless ya!cody"
3,it's pretty good,this c.d is o.k. but toby still raps and the music is kinda corny take out some of toby's rap and this would be good buy this if you want some d.c talk rap
3,Free at Last,"I bought this CD used, and I'm very pleased with my purchase. The CD did show wear but nothing to hinder the quality of the sound. Thanks for your service!"
2,A Great Vanilla Ice Tribute Album,"I'm not sure why they are a hit, but the definately are an embarassment to hip-hop and even Christian music. Nice try, but it's time to catch a clue guys, you suck at rap and hip-hop. D"
4,no problems,"My boyfriend has used this set several times for making me steaks with no problems at all. His friends are all wowed by it and jealous that they don't have their own. We haven't used all the components so I can't give a thorough review, otherwise 5 stars would be warranted."
2,I liked this product until...,"I liked this product until we made kabobs. The skewers in the set seemed perfect! When we put the kabobs on the grill rack to cook, a white-ish foam started coming out of the handles. We make kabobs a few times a month and have never had a problem like this with any other skewers. All of the other pieces in the set are great, but we had to throw away the skewers, along with our dinner that night!"
5,great buy,"Was very pleased with this product I am giving it as a wedding present so wanted it to be extra nice, it more than fit the bill. The carring case is constructed of a fine metal as well as all the parts to the bar-b-que set. Delivery was very fast . All and all the product is first quality and it presents its self very nicely. Highly recommend this set."
4,Great value,This products does is a smart buy. It gives you a great number of instruments for a very reasonable price. The product performs as advertised.
4,Experimentation and Measurement,Good book. Very relevant to my work and it provides a different dimension to how we look at what we are doing.
5,best thing ever,John cleese at his best. The entire cast is a jem & each episode makes me laugh every time I watch them (& I have watched each more times than I can count).If your looking for a sitcom that rings of the all time greats such as Dick Van Dyke & I Love Lucy but has an updated feel this one is a dream come true
3,ruined by the endless interviews,"I would buy these in a second if it wasnt for all the tiredsome interviews . those being in between every episode is boring and it makes you want to just turn it off. I have the complete set on VHS, and would love to see it on DVD. when they put it on DVD without all the boring comentaries,send me the complete set."
4,Rockwell Kent,you need to be a big fan of Kent to want this book. I have some of the Salamina dishes and have wondered for years about their relationship. this book has the answers.
2,Vol are a let down,"We purchased Elements Vol 7: psychic. It only has three episodes on it but the kids wanted it and it was on sale so I said OK. What a disappointment! The DVD contained PART ONE of ""Abra and the Psychic Showdown."", ""Pearls are a Spoink's best Friend"", and PART TWO of ""Address Unknown.""We looked for another elements DVD with the missing episodes with no luck. It's just a shame. Think how much money this company could make if they were just more careful with how they packaged these episodes."
4,Good Book For Married Women,I started off trying to read her book about virtue but couldn't get into it and switched to this one. Must easier to read although I did not understand some of the questions. It did open my eyes to some things I was missing and even though I am middle aged and have been married for over 30 years I really got some good out of it. My only complaint was all the flipping back and forth looking up bible verses. Those need to be in better order and not the same verses over and over. I also skipped over the section about raising kids since it was too late for me.I would say this is a great book for young married women.
5,A Must for World Music Lovers,"African and world music fans should celebrate; this is one of the finest recordings to come out in a long time. With the ground-breaking mix of traditional Mali instrumentals and blues based vocals this CD soars. After a long day this is now my favorite music for unwinding as well as renewing my energies. On the top of my list, ""A Long Time Ago"", bluesy jazz vocals are accompanied perfectly with traditional African rhythms. And on another favorite, the serene ""Nemalon"", Mamadou's hypnotic melodies remind me of gentle raindrops falling and the haunting vocals by Vanessa effortlessly blend in. These amazing musicians will give you a refreshing taste of new world music. If you're looking for something that can restore your sense of harmony of the traditional and the new, buy this cd - you won't regret it!"
1,DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY,"I have had 2 units from this company, and both have given me problems.My WK8000 just had the compressor lock-up after only 2.5 years and while it is still covered under the warrentee, They want me to pay for shipping the unit (100lbs+) both ways, and all the labor.I called the company 3 times and talked to three different people, and each one could not have been more rude.They don't care about their customers.I called the store where I bought the unit and was informed that they had the same experience and dropped selling their products."
3,"Very good Message, but could be presented more professional.","dc Talk is now a hit Christian artist, with a double platinum album, Jesus Freak, a platinum album, Supernatural, a greatest hits album, and are now taking an ""intermission"" to work on solo projects. This is their 2nd cd, which isn't much better than the first. Though dc Talk is now doing rock/pop, they started out with hip-hop. If you like ol' school hip-hop, i would suggest this album. I believe this album is suitable for EVERYONE!"
3,"""Nu Thang"" is OK, but not par for DC Talk.","""Nu Thang"" has a few good songs on it, but it's not par for DC Talk. It's like the first DC Talk CD, ""DC Talk"", but it has a little more advanced melody and harmony."
4,They Follow up a debut very well,"THIS CD IS GOOD THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THOUGH IS THAT THEY ARE NOT AS IN YOUR FACE AS THEY WERE ON THEIR SELF-TITLED DEBUT. ALTHOUGH THEY DO HAVE SOME VERY DEEP AND POWERFUL SONGS LIKE ""WALLS"" AND ""THINGS OF THIS WORLD"" THEY HAVE FUN SOUNDING MUSIC LIKE ""I LUV RAP MUSIC"" AND FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T LIKE THAT TOBY MAC(McKEEHAN) WROTE EVERYTHING ON THEIR FIRST RECORD YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW THAT MICHAEL TAIT HELPED WRITE SOME OF THE TRACKS.THIS IS A GREAT CD YOU HAVE TO GET IT IF YOU ARE A DC TALK FAN, A RAP FAN OR A PERSON WHO LIKES MUSIC."
2,When Toby Raps,"Nu Thang was a little improvement from the first CD, but pretty much the same thing: rap. My favorite song is `Walls' which is about racism. All the lyrics are great but the rap gets old. If you enjoy rap you will like this CD because thats what the whole CD is!"
4,Good Memories,Christmas with the Chipmunks is a good CD to listen to while hanging up christmas decorations; it brings back excellent memories from childhood.
5,When Christmas was fun!,"I had this record when I was little so when I saw it out on cd I had to buy it for my kids. We loved it this holiday season. It took me way back in time and was just as much fun now as it was then. All Christmas, every time we got in the car my kids wanted to hear it. If you like Christmas, you will like this cd."
1,Buyers beware,"As of today November 15th 2006 I have bought two copys of this only because after buying the first one last night at my local Wal-mart, I got a defect..returned it today and got a replacement with the same defect in the same spot. Track two, about 6 seconds into the song when Simon says (no pun intended) ""I'll say we are"" you can hear a glitch of some kind. It's great to finally have this expanded & remastered, but Capitol needs to do something about this problem. I've decided I'm gonna keep returning this CD until I get one that plays fine..look out Wal-mart, here I come yet AGAIN."
5,Love this,"I loved the chipmunk records as a little kid, had not heard these songs in 30 plus years. This CD brings back a lot of great and cherrished memory's when things were better and more simple, my brother is six years older than me and hated it when mom or dad would put the LP on, but my dad would smile and tell him, we listened to them with you, now were going to play them for him. Great times and memories. I recomend this totaly for little ones, and those that want to remember their own childhood Christmas's AND even the young at heart."
4,Great to sing a long,"Ok, I remember singing these songs when I was a kid so I had to get this for my daughter. She loves it and we both sing a long with Alvin....."
4,A classic fantasy novel,"I picked up this book in the store out of sheer curiosity, and ended up reading it cover to cover the same day. (I read fast!) I loved the updating of the kids sent away from parents theme and the strong characters, especially Susan. I am glad Dale Peck plans to make this a series - I look forward to the next installment.The main story is set in the Sea of Time - a place outside of our own time boundaries. Murray, the five year old brother, is the first to travel forward in time, and comes back not only changed but with sobering news: Susan is killed in that future. Trying to figure out how to escape from the sea without losing Susan is their first problem - mermaids and pirates give them others. Family and unexpected friendships play an important part in helping them save themselves - and time itself. If you enjoy the Narnia books, give this a try!"
5,Thoroughly Delightful,"Drift House is gripping and adventure-filled, jam packed with mermaids, pirates, clever parrots and magical dumbwaiters. There is enough ""action"" to appeal to children of all ages, and like the previous reviewer I was so involved, I read it straight through in one sitting. But it is also wonderfully clever, and often laugh out loud funny. In the best tradition of classic children's fantasy novels (Nesbit, Eager, Lewis, etc.), Drift House is never condescending or simplistic, but instead trusts and challenges children's intelligence. Like those classic authors, Peck has created a vividly detailed imaginary world with just the right amount of ""real world"" connections. I can't wait for the next book!"
2,Still Waiting For The Rerelease Of Sellers On Sellers,"The DVD release of Sellers On Sellers (for $34 yet) has been halted due to court actions by the Sellers estate against the BBC. According to most sources, this is the Sellers ""inside bio"" to get.It supposedly has at least 90 minutes of great stuff featuring lots of Sellers home movies. Hopefully the BBC will pay off the Sellers estate so they can get this great DVD back on the market again.And when and if it does get rereleased, hopefully it'll also be less than $34 - but hey, maybe it won't be, because the BBC will understandably be passing along their payoff to the Sellers estate to their customers. The thing is, though, because it's Sellers, it just might be worth the extra price for a change."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"There is very little point in seeing this DVD. We are told ""Also included are snippets"" [of some of Sellers' rarely seen works]. Snippets is the right word, they are tiny. His unknown works will still be unknown to you after seeing this. The only things we really see are his TV ads. The script is dull and uninformative. It didn't cost much, but still wasn't worth the price."
1,Not Even worth the 1!,"This movie is just terrible, first the main character Frost, looks like Kevin Smith the director and we are suppose to take him serious as some bad ass special oops solider give me a break. The story has holes in it and the CGI effects makes it look cheap. For flicks like this it should be latex and nothing else. The reason I gave it a 1 is because its a good story and if handled right could have put a new spin on vamp movies. The first vampire is from the middle east so that would have been something new but they just screwed it up tooo much. if you do see this rent it don't buy."
1,Not good,"Story seems to have an interesting contemporary start but does not do justice to developing the characters. No notable special effects. Seems like a home made movie. It was part of a 4 movie pack, I did not specifically buy this one nor would I recommend it."
1,Frost leaves me cold,"There is very little vampirism in this film - mainly because the chief character is not the vampire, but the vampire hunter. The 'hero' looks like another Don 'the Dragon' Wilson clone.There's not much to say about this lamely plotted film. It has a few computer graphics that are interesting - like a Russian helicopter flying around but other than that, this is a major yawn"
4,great!,"I'd have preferred to be able to give 4.75 stars rather than 4 or 5. The reason for this is the placement of the RECORD button. I have made more than a couple inadvertant recordings simply as a result of handling the unit. Other than that, I like the fit and feel of the thing. I don't know that the micro-SD slot contributes much to the user -I think it was meant rather to contribute to SanDisk (manufacturers of same, not coincidentally). I like that the unit will ""keep track"" of your progress through a long track (I like to use my Sansa for listening to audiobooks, the files of which can be quite long and finding one's place manually can be a rank tedium). The screen is quite nice- disproportionately large for so small a unit. Finally: battery life for mine on the first two charges was between 20 and 22 hours. Not bad at all."
4,MP3 Player,I purchased it for my grandaughter and she loves it. Easy to use. The only drawback is the recharger has to be plugged into a computer USB port and if you are on vacation that is impossible. A recharger that can be just plugged in is available but that is an extra charge that is substantial.
2,Not worth it,"I purchased the SanDisk SDMX4-6144 Sansa e270 6 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot a few weeks ago and I am very disappointed. The features seemed to be a better value that the Apple Ipod Nano but the thumb wheel for selection feels cheap and requires quite a bit of pressure to operate. If you have a lot of songs on the unit, you will wish there was an easire way. Also, after 2 1/2 weeks of use, the unit froze up on me during a synchronization and I have had to return it. I am getting a refund and buying a Nano instead."
2,Don't buy not worth the price,"First time buyer, too many features, needed something simple to use. The keys to go forward and backward or turn off get easily stuck and do not work. The sound was good but often loud. Over all the item was of very poor quality. Just as soon as I got all my faroite songs loaded and the canned music erased, the record feature got stuck in 'on mode' and I could not turn it off; go forward or backward !! I had to return the defective device as still on unable to ever turn it off. It was very disapointing."
1,MISTAKE!,"This little thing is only commpatable with WINDOWS XP! I got a great deal, but I have Windows 2000...not good! Don't buy this if you don't have Windows XP.....I can't even return it. Sandisk doesn't have anything that works with my OS![...]"
2,Not too impressive,"It comes with Rhapsody, but won't work with it. It doesn't work with Windows Media Player 11 so you have to go find a download for Windows Media Player 10. I've had to reformat this thing a number of times, and I've only had it for two months. If it was more stable, I'd love it. I'm starting to re-think my hatred of iPods."
3,Workhorse,"This unit has been handed down a couple times over the years and now only used sparingly after essentially being replaced by cell phones, but it is good at its primary function - organize and play MP3s. Gave it 3 stars since it works great with no real complaints, but no aspect will blow you away.I synch with WMP which does fine. Battery life is a definite plus."
4,decent player,"Not an exciting player, but one that works well. I've had my 6 gig for 3 years now and use it 8 hours a day. My usb is half connected to the computer so that it can work as a charging station. I never worry about it going low on power."
4,Sansa,I really like my mp3 player...the computer program is a little hard to use but other than that its ok...the only other thing I don't really like is I can't plug it into the computer to charge and listen to it at the same time.
4,Great Mp3 player,"I love my new 6 GB SanDisk. I had a smaller one, and it just wasn't enoughto store everything I needed. I can see photos, record audio podcasts....I love it and the sound is great. I had a small problem with the ""blue screen of death"" ....I called tech support ...which is excellent I might add...andfound that it was a simple fix. Great product, Great support, arrived quickly...."
2,Not a great model.,"Apparently, this product comes as a e270 or an e270v - but it isn't advertised which one you're buying. The one I purchased is unable to add playlists and unable to delete tracks directly from the player. Just wish I had known which one I was purchasing and the differences between the two."
4,Sansa e270,"This is a great mp3 player FOR THE PRICE. Keyword: FOR THE PRICE. It works fine, and is very fun to use (the turn wheel is addicting). It is not an iPod, and you should not think that it is one. It is very compact, and has a pretty good battery life. The audio when you are watching videos lags and the videos and pictures take a very long time to encode. It also is compatible (but harder to use) on a Mac. It does not work with iTunes or iPhoto. This is great for listening to music and is simple to use."
3,sansas has firmware problem,"Sansas has an overall good sound, only if you have a superior head phone. Its text and graphics are inferior to that of IPOD, but still legible. Battery life last longer than expected. The one thing that this player has is the constant blank out of screen while music is playing, feels like a PC breaking down. Firmware has problem and updating from website with instruction on connecting to USB does not work well, maybe because the firmware is so bad that it can't be upgraded. I hope there is an easier way to fix the blanking screen."
2,Beware .aa is not supported,I do not understand why the audible files(.aa files) are not supported while supported in the older versions which are much cheaper.I do not recommend it as you cannot listen to any audio book from the one's sold here.
1,Crappy e270,"I got this thought it was cool for awhile...It worked grate then after a few months it just stopped. I had barely listened to it within thos months. One day I was listning to it and it died, I took it out of my pocket and the screen was blank. I tried turning it on but nothing happend. So I flip the hold switch tried again nothing. I plugged it in to my computer, it did nothing but the selecter wheel still lighted up!Battery could not have been bad barely used it within thos 5 months.I would have given it 0 stars but lowest you can go is 1 star. NOTE: my e270 would not work with any other earphones except the ones it came with, only one aftermarket earbud would work with it."
1,Poor Service from Shipping Company,"This item was supposed to be a Christmas present. I ordered it on December 17 and paid for 1-day shipping. It was (and is!) showing ""In Stock"", but for some reason I won't get it until possibly February??? Come on!"
1,Sandisk 6GB Sansa e270 died after 1.5 months.,"I bought this player to replace my iRiver MP3 ""brick"".The sound quality is average, lower than my older player. This morning, after 1.5 months of LIGHT use (40 minutes a day 5 days a week) the player died without any reason. The wheel lights up but there is nothing on the screen. I cannot even turn it off. The power button does nothing.Stay away !"
3,"Looks good, but could be better with some thoughtful engineering",I don't own the item but have the following checklist to add:good built in memory: checkexternal memory: checkpicture stills: check (with png! ++)voice recorder: checkExternal audio input jack: no gooperating system independant: no govideo: checkmp3: checkwma: checkwav: checkoog: no goflacc: no goacc: no gofm tuner: checkam tuner: no gooff the shelf batteries: no goI'm still searching for the ultimate flash mp3 player! This one is as close as I've seen so far.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"Oh if only I could rate this item with negative stars!What a piece of trash! The design of the player is nice and I love how I can drag and drop files through explorer, but just as I am starting to enjoy my player, it breaks.The first one didn't last a week. It just stopped turning on by day six. The second one didn't last a week either and it also stopped turning on. Sandisk obviously doesn't care about quality control, since both players malfunctioned in under seven days. And yes, the batteries were charged and I did not in any way damage the player to cause the problems.I'm returning my piece of trash and requesting a refund that I will probably spend on an i pod. I hate i pods, but I hate being jerked around even more.Here's a word of advice to the potential customer. Save the packaging. I guarntee by day six your player will break too."
1,Doesn't work,"This is a beautiful machine, and I was very excited to buy it. Unfortunately, it locked up twice, once while synchronizing, WMP 10, and once while listening. Both times I could not turn it off, and it was unresponsive. I did not call tech support, because I have little patience for products that don't work as they should."
5,Good Stuff,"I am new to MP3 players and I bought this as my 1st and it rocks, better than the other guys. Lots more features for the price. Easy to use, great sound, great quality, great price"
4,LUV IT!!!!,I ordered the 2GB model in December and it came like 4 days later. The only problem i ran to was one of the songs said bad track and i turned to another song and the WHOLE MP3 player froze. I called sandisk and they was nice to help me. So i took off the song that caused the problem and the problem was solved. OVERALL I LUV IT!!!!! BUY IT!!!!
1,"Over Promised, Under Delivered","The specs and price on this player look great. It's a nice form factor although it turned out being smaller than I had expected.Two things to watch out for ... 1) The player locked up constantly. A quick Google search reveals that this is common and might be related to the firmware. 2) The ""scroll wheel"" (the blue circle) comes across as just cheap. It doesn't have a smooth scroll to it.I ended up returning mine because I couldn't live with the lock-ups."
4,Two bad units in a row!!! Third one is good finally!,"What is wrong with this? The first one I got from Amazon was clearly an used unit. It had black dirty mark all over the player body, and it even got finger-prints on the screen (below the screen protector)! Okay, I just did an exchange with Amazon and the new unit was received within a couple days. What a surprise! There was a big scratch on the player! I requested another exchange, and what they told me is they couldn't do it anymore. THANK YOU Amazon! You really want me to do business with you again?Other than that, the player itself works fine, although it lack unicode support. I flashed Rockbox (a 3rd party firmware) and it's much better.UPDATE: Finally Amazon sent me a third one and it's all good now. Oh well, how do I change the rating?"
4,6 gig mp3 player with a good deal of features,"I like this mp3 player, but since I have a crap ton with me at the moment, it's actually taken a backseat til I get home.pros:1) 6 gigs, screen capable of pictures mp3 and video2) sd slot is a nice addition for music oversaturated people3) at 40 bucks, even refurbished, it is a stealcons:1) clunkier than just about every other mp3 player I ever owned, which doesn't make it very versatile in my case.2) doesn't necessarily deliver anymore features for the size (it's not that big, but for some reason I've always tended to buy small mp3 players)3) it's not as asthetically pleasing, but I guess that's just being nitpicky"
1,Really nifty if it wasn't completely useless...,"As soon as this little gem arrived in the mail, I broke it out of the box and plugged into my Mac Mini.. and nothing. Mac OS didn't even recognize that I had plugged something in. It didn't recognize it as a removable drive, and iTunes had no idea that an MP3 player was attached. OS X didn't even complain when I disconnected the device ""improperly"". The device has a number of nice features, but I hardly got to use them, much less did I get to experience the infamous firmware bugs I keep reading about, thanks to its complete incompatibility with OS X. There is absolutely no reason why Windows should be able to simply see this MP3 player as a removable drive when it doesn't even exist to OS X. I've read reports that the device works perfectly with Linux, so this has to be a deliberate limitation. I should have bought an iPod."
3,great but .. ...,"The player is small and great and stuff, but SanDisk has no repair option for their products should you, like me, crack the screen by bumping lightly into a table. you'll have to buy a completely new one."
4,beats the nano,its shoter then the nano but thicker but it has fm radio and video plus it comes with the program to put the video on it which is really easy i had a nano before this and i am much happier with this the only thing i can find bad about it is that its hard to put playlists on it and the you cant go back just one screen the back button goes back to the main menu each time but you get used to that but if you want a small mp3 player that holds a pretty decent amount of songs and video this is the way to go plus you cant beat the price
4,It was great...,"Ok when i first got my sansa it was wonderfull. Everything worked fine and i rocked out with it in my pocket. A few weeks ago i decided to update the firmware like you should and now my sansa no longer works. I would hold off on buying this product right now, it seems that sandisk has some issues that need to be worked out. However, the player itself is solid and nice."
3,This is a Great Player,"Let me begin by saying ""I am NOT a tech head"". I struggle to get by with most computer related technologies. I have had no problems learning and using this mp3 player.I like the fact that I can use the Microsoft software and all I did was plug the player in and the music was down loaded. I added all of my CD's and was able to carry over 1200 songs with me on my last road trip. I also use this with my workouts. I only use the player for music.I was considering the Apple Nano initially. The software and Itune monopoly and high cost forced me to consider this product, I am very glad I did.Alot of people have mentioned that they don't like the ""cheap"" feel of the wheel; I agree with that. I also agree that the four buttons around the wheel are marginally hard to get use to.If you have been considering a flash mp3 player, this one should be at the top of your list."
1,Bleh,"The Apple Nanos are much better. Not only do they sound better they look better and iTunes software works great with them. All of the Sansas sound markedly worse than an iPod, the scroll wheel is clumsy at best, and the screen is dim and pixelated. Don't waste your money. There is a reason these arer in bargain bins everywhere."
1,"expansion slot only uses ""microsd cards"" 2gb max.","CAUTION-- The Sansa website states ""that all ""microsd"" and ""microsdhc"" cards may be used with the e200 series players"". That is a FALSE statement!!!! All the e200 series players may only use the ""microsd card"" maximum--2gb. NONE of the players may use the microsdhc cards. I checked the website before I bought an e260 player. I bought an 8gb ""microsdhc"" card and I found out the hard way. I wrote customer support and basically got the answer OOPS!! Sorry your screwed. I am now the proud owner of an 8gb microdsdhc card that has no use. If you plan to add more than 2gb to these players forget it!!!"
2,"Good mp3 player, but unreliable","Only lasted 9 months of fairly careful use before dying. Mine also had issues with illuminating the back light... periodically, it would just not light the display and you had to do a reset to bring it back. Replaced with a video nano."
4,Great Deal,"Pro: 1. great price for the 6-GB's. 2. Easy to use. 3. Works with several mediums (Media Player, Rhapsody etc)Con: 1. The ear buds fall out, made a $12 investment for a better pair that stay in my ears. 2.All in all, I'm happy with my investment."
2,"Many great features, but lacks most important one: Sound Quality","I'm not really an audiophile, but I do enjoy great sound fidelity.This player offers many great features and the user interface is decent (not as intuitive as the other better players out on the market). I can't really complain about those two things. It's got so many features that I thought $180 for the player was a steal.My only complaint (and a big one at that) is the sound quality this player transmits. I use Shure E4C earphones, and they definitely expose a bad source. The sound on this player compared to the iAudio X5L that I sold doesn't even compare (i've tried the iriver clix too, and that thing also sounds way better). The sound is very flat and muffled to my ears, it lacks any aggressiveness or warmth that i've been accustomed to. Bass response is also very muffled."
5,Take all of the reviews in perspective !,"I've used my 6g Sansa for 2 weeks and love it. I'm happy with its versatility and ease of use. Some complained about boot up time but I find that inconsequential. Some complained about noise between recorded tracks, I've not noticed that. Some complained about the size of the buttons. I have extra large hands and have absolutely NO problems. I did approach a Best Buy salesgirl prior to ordering mine and asked which MP3players have the least returns, she said SanDisk by a wide margin and I hadn't told her I was considering one. I'm completely happy with my Sansa 6g and so far have 500 songs loaded. Battery life is MUCH greater than my daughter's Ipod. The FM radio makes it even more versital and I have mine plugged into the sound system on my Honda GoldWing and the cassette and cd players are no longer used. Buy one you won't be sorry !"
4,My Daughter loves This,"I bought this for my teenage daughter this past Christmas and she loves it. She had hoped for a Nano but after trying this out, she much prefers this. She says that the Radio has good reception, the picture is good and it has great sound.It does seem to be well made and has good battery life. No charger included, it charges from your computer, my daughter seems to be OK with that so it gets my approval."
5,Use this song in my parenting classess--parents love it!!!,"I use the song from this album ""I WANT TO BE JUST LIKE YOU"" in my Redirecting Children's Behavior parenting course.....parents love it and usually go out and buy the CD...it really touches us, as parents, where WE LIVE. The music is so inspiring and so beautiful...I feel so peaceful when I listen to this music. Phillips, Craig & Dean are the best Christian artists recording today in MY opinion. You know those guys are Christians because you can FEEL THE HOLY SPIRIT alive in their music and in the lyrics...this music MOVES you in a very positive, uplifting, spiritual way. WAY TO GO...offering this type music...too bad not many teenagers want to listen to Christian music, because this music is great to listen to and the lyrics SPEAK to you....very positive and encouraging to see young men putting out such positive messages on the CD music media."
5,IN A CLASS OF IT'S OWN,This novel is her best work yet. It is exceptional. This novel explores a friendship between two women and the significant issues that come between them.
4,As usual Ms. Campbell shines,"I always buy her books as soon as they're published. This story goes straight to the heart of so many issues, guilt, lack of forgiveness and how hard it is to love and trust. One of the best book that I've read this year."
2,Way Too Much Going On In This Book!!!,"It took me so long to finally finish this book. It wasnt because it was over 500 pages either. This book started out real good with Hosanna, but once she stopped talking, so did the book. I think the story line had good intentions, but some of the characters could have been left out like Asia, Sam, Jolie just to name a few. In real life, Kent would've never been hired again from a company he stole from and tried to blackmail. The ending of this book seemed to come together... I have read Brothers and Sisters, and it was good, but this one left alot to be desired."
4,What A Great Book,"Pages' book selection for the month of March was Bebe Moore Campbell's What You Owe Me. In this novel, she takes a deep look into the lives of characters connected through career and friendship. Ms. Campbell invites the reader to look honestly at relationships and offers an open portrayal of life issues that transcend time, gender and race. The book considers the similarities and differences among racial groups as they confront racism and the demons of their past. Members of the Pages Readers Group found this book to be intriguing although a bit slow at times. Overall Bebe Moore Campbell's ability to detail the inner lives of her characters engages the readers and provides a thought provoking opportunity to explore race relations, the definition of family and the true meaning of success."
4,Unmasking Stereotypes through Strong Portrayals,"Hours of juicy listening to a story of epic proportions following the effects through three generations of the sins of the mothers, fathers, and society before them.Sometimes banal, but more often engrossing, ""What You Owe Me"" gives us a balanced portrait of human nature and the races and cultures within it. Bebe moore Campbell is particularly strong on motivation--and that's why all the side-stories are so important--they help the reader understand whey people do what would otherwise seem unthinkable. Campbell draws the curtain of stereotypes and sets a few of them free, once seen clearly.--Janet Grace Riehl, Sightlines: A Poet's Diary"
4,"Long, but Pleasurable","This book may have been long, but i still enjoyed every bit of it. There were several characters other than the main character Matriece, and the late mother who is the opening narrator, Hosanna. Each and every character is well-developed. The author does a good job of making sure that the reader understands the viewpoints of each character. It was simply amazing. Trust me, each character contributes significantly to the whole of the story.Hosanna is the mother of Matriece and Vonette, who are as different as night and day. However, Hosanna is now deceased, but still watches over her daughters, especially Matriece, who has the power to seek the revenge she never lived to pursue. Will Matriece fulfill her late mother's wishes in the end? You should definintely read this story to find out. This is a nice long read that entertains at best. I recommend it."
2,Not as good as it should be,"I read ""Your Blues Ain't Like Mine"" with awe and appreciation -- a spectacular book that has stayed with me for years. I expected the same quality of writing, story and that magical touch that makes so very few books special when I started this one. The writing is still wonderful, but the plot is not much better than a Danielle Steele potboiler. It could have been improved by judicious pruning of way too many stereotypical characters and way too many storylines magically tied up in the last 30 pages. Ms. Campbell has the voice to tell a rich and vibrant story -- I hope she does so in her next effort. This one falls short of her gifts."
2,Waaaaaaaaay too long,"Yes, the book had an interesting storyline, however, it could have been told in about 250-300 pages. There was NO need for the book to be as long as it was. Sometimes, when you have too many details, you lose your audience and your audience forgets what your point was in the first place. I mean, did I really need to visualize exactly how Vonette's house was decorated? Not really. That information was not relevant. There were constant examples of too many details that I actually started skimming my way through until I got to something relevant. I even read another book while trying to finish this book. The ONLY reason I finished this book is because my job is very slow during the summer months so I had a lot of free time. If you have lots of free time with nothing to do, by all means, read this book. If you're looking for a quick read that holds your interest, keep looking."
4,Very good book. You will enjoy it.,"I found this to be a very good book that ended wonderfully. Some of the other reviews said that it was too long and too detailed but I think the character development was perfect. The author followed each character to the end of the book. In my opinion, it is very well written. The book was recommended to me by a friend who said it was the best she had ever read. I wouldn't go that far, but do recommend it as a good read."
2,Can't finish it!!!,"I'm at page 150 and have decided to take a break from this novel. I can't keep going. The novel starts off slow, but it is interesting when Hosanna's character is narrating the story. When Matriece's character takes over the story seems to go downhill and I'm bombarded with substories which are boring and seemingly irrelevant to the central theme of the book. Maybe I'll come back to it later or slowly try to finish it, but for now I'm moving on to another book!!"
4,master story teller,"BeBe Campbell is a master of weaving 15 subplots all into one story. Most authors would stumble over themselves trying to introduce all these charators, not Ms Campbell. I wenjoyed the book, however the ending was just too tidy and unreal. Especially the scene where after the deal is completed Mr Mooney suffers a heart attack and goes to join his Hosanna. (Pluezze)This book covered what can happen when you dont forgive, try to live anther person legacy, racism, classism all of it. I'm still a fan."
3,Brothers and Sisters rehash,"If you are a Bebe Mooore Campbell fan, you are familiar with her epic Brothers & Sisters. I found What You Owe Me very similar. Though well written with very developed characters, this novels has many of the same ""types"": a snotty black family, a sister who came from the 'hood, but has done well for herself, the white girlfriend, the blue-collar brother, etc. Also, I found the ending too convenient, too happy, and too quick. After 500+ pages, all of the stories were wrapped up in several paragraphs. Still, I remain a fan and look forward to something different from this talented black author."
4,Bebe does it again...,"""What You Owe Me"" is a fun read without being completely mindless. Bebe Moore Campbell develops her characters in a way that makes them come alive. Although the plot is sometimes predictable - as is life itself - it is always entertaining. Upon completing the novel I felt as if I was saying goodbye to friends...always the sign of a good read if you ask me."
2,What you Owe Me,You OWE me a refund. This has got to be the worst yet for B.M. Campbell. What You Owe Me is long and boring. There are many story lines none of which have much meat or interesting texture. The more you read the more you will wish you hadn't started the book. I just kept wishing it was over.
4,Decent Reading,"The storyline was great.However, a bit wordy. Found myself speed reading towards the end (glancing to find the important parts). Recommend a lot of patience while reading this book. Definitely not a ""quick read."""
3,tries to take on too much,"Stylistically, this novel suffers from a plot that Ms. Campbell isn't adept enough to adequately develop. Rare moments of enlightmentment are ruined by so many cliches. The focus on money, money, MONEY grows tired after the first hundred pages or so. She tries too hard to hit her audience over the head with the ""buppie"" mentality.Don't get me wrong, this is not a ""trash"" read, but it could have been much more. Instead, we get a lot of pop-culture banality and money-worship forced down our throats."
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of Ms. Campbell's having read all of her previous novels and I eagerly awaited the release of this novel.Although I thought the basic storyline was good, I felt that there were far too many different characters and too many 'sub-stories'. I would have liked to have seen some of the characters and storylines eliminated (Blair/Porter/Judd..Kent/Peggy/ Jolie..Rachel) as such characters were not central or critical to the main story. Perhaps this would have allowed the author the opportunity to spend more time developing more emotional aspects of characters such as Asia, Sam and Tavares.I also found the book to be relatively predictable and thus, it lacked the unique quality I have come to appreciate in some of Ms. Campbell's other works.I thoroughly enjoyed Brothers and Sisters, Successful Women, Angry Men, Your Blues Ain't Like Mine and Singing in the Comeback Choir. In comparison, this novel was extremely disappointing."
1,Yawn,"I have read most of Bebe Moore Campbell's books, and was thilled when this came out. Unfortunately the thrill soon became a big snore. The story drags and the characters are dull and convulted. There's just too much of nothing going on here. I can't wait til someone asks to borrow it so it's not on my bookshelf anymore."
2,Z-Z-Z...,"This book began in such a powerful way. The first hundred pages are an excellent story of friendship and betrayal. You really feel for these women and I wished that Hosanna and Gilda had developed their own companies and competed that way. But Hosanna died and took the wonderfulness of the book with her. The story takes a Judith Krantz turn with all these characters that seem to have nothing to do with the story of Gilda and Hosanna. Though excellently written, the story becomes all powder and fluff. Perhaps this is to show how surface people in this industry are. I'm trying to finish this book but too much time is spent on these vapid characters that I'm just not feeling. The story becomes like everything else out there. What a shame for a book with such a promising start. I'll try and finish it, but I'm in no rush."
1,Why?,This pack of 12 costs about 20% more than 12 separate bottles.....from the same people (acehardwareoutlet).
2,poor text book,This textbook was used in my class at tech school. It is very poorly organized and written. [...]
3,Good troubleshooting sections,"Overall good book in conjunction with Whitman book. With a 60 page section on troubleshooting, I got what I need with this book. Use these in conjunction with the Audel series."
3,"No ""Last Date""","This book was surposed to have Floyd Cramer's ""Last Date"" in it. It did not. Other then that, it was a good book."
5,The Best Country Songs Ever,It looked brand new--was extremely happy with this purchase! I will buy from Amazon again! I have always had success!
4,The Japanese version has a couple of more tracks.,"This is not one of the best Incognito CD's Bluey's recorded but, there are some great tracks.In order:1 star - Stay Mine3 stars- Got To Know;4 stars- Slow Down (Get A Grip); Bring you Down; River Runnin Black;5 stars- Reach Out; On The Road, pt. 1 & 2; Down To Earth; Castles In The Air; Worlds Collide; There Will Come A Day; Cut It LooseSkin on my Skin is one of the best songs that I've heard from Incognito. It's beautiful! It deserves 100 stars.The Japanese disc has a live version of 'Pick Up The Pieces' sung by Christopher Ballin. Chris is a great singer but that track [isn't very good]!This is not Incognito's best work but I give the CD a B+"
2,Life? Where?,"I have almost every Incognito CD and have been lucky enough to catch them live in Cape Town, so I know what they're capable of. Well, at least I THOUGHT I knew. This new album changed that. After getting hold of an advance copy a month early in Japan, I couldn't wait to get it onto my deck. Wasted journey."
3,Incognito Rushed,"This collection of songs sounds like some studio back titles.I loved the CD with the new vocalists, better than 100 degrees, however,I liked the inspirational lyrics and interaction between the vocalists. Too much R and B , I guess they are reaching for a wider audience. Still love Incognito very much and can't wait for the American Tour. It appears that Bluey is trying to do the Norman Conners thing.... finding new vocalists. My favorite.. There will come a Day. It is worth purchasing, however don't rush the creativity in your songs Bluey..."
2,Time to quit guys,"I has a sneakin' suspision before I handed over the 'hard earned' for this one, that it might not live up to my expectations, after all Incognito have launched some wickedly funky albums over the years. This one starts of light-weight, and drifts along in fairly uninspiring manner, definitely more soul than funk. The new vocals are not as good as what has come before. Just as I was about to give up on it, someone gave Richard Bailey (or a drum machine) a slap, and all of a sudden off they go, funkin it all up big time. Couple of stormin tracks ('specially track 8) and some fluid latin stuff almost makes it a buy, but out of 14 odd tracks it ain't good enuf. Apart from a few highlights, overall it has a formularised churned out feel. I'd like to see the band get a couple of new players in to give a new dimension to the sound. Next...."
2,Blade came off after the 7th potato,"First I want to inform you that I bought the Norpro 6021 from another place not from Amazon but wanted to review so that it might help others.I just received item in the mail so I washed it and started using it to make some fries but after the 7th potato one of the blades for the small cutter came off, the box states ""commercial French fry cutter"" the frame itself seems sturdy but the blades are cheap and I have no idea where to get replacements. I paid more hoping it would be better than the plastic ones."
2,french fry maker,I tried this a few times...it was exhausting and frustrating...the potato would get stuck in the grate...I guess you get what you pay for..this is not worth the money
1,Bad content,"I purchased this book to prepare for the GACE and found the content with many errors in it. Therefore, after taking three of the reviews or about a third of the way, I stopped because I did not feel comfortable with the information I was recieving. Pass on this book because it just is unreliable..."
3,NTES,"Questions are relative to the topic; since this book has possible exam questions only, it should be purchased with the coordinating textbook."
3,food for the folklorist,"A series of case studies involving the (still-common) belief that the dead can be jealous of the living and return to capture them, Food for the Dead is meticulously researched. It should be noted that documentary evidence concerning digging up the dead in New England is sparse. I attended a lecture given by Bell last autumn, and he certainly seems to know everything there is to know about the topic. The book is somewhat repetitive, however, which makes it difficult to sustain interest."
4,Eye opener on relatively unknown part of American history,"Food for the Dead is both intellectual and entertaining. The author is both an academic and an excellent writer for us lay folk. I recommend this to history buffs, horror fans who want to know about their vampires in a truer sense, and to writers interested in what makes a monster tick in the mind of our readers. I don't write vampire stuff, but fear, especially fear of something unknown, is fascinating."
1,Same ol' rhetoric,"This is truely the worst compilation of ""anything"" Hitler said.My biggest complaint is I ordered a cheaper, used version and they slammed me with a new one for over $40.00!Maybe if this was a $9.95 deal it would be worth my while.Nothing new is revealed. And what the text actually shows you are complete fabrications half the time!There is nothing ""hypnotic, or mesmerising"" about any of this.Stay far away from this disgrace.I've yet to completely watch it through to the end because it just leaves a bad sour taste in my mouth...and wallet."
4,"Thank you for ""Hitler Diaries-Starring Adolf Hitler"" VHS","""Hitler Diaries-Starring Adolf Hitler"" VHS. I was interested in some new info about these times. The film is interesting, reviewsas I remember were a common. Thank you! Arkady R."
3,Very strong spray,"I bought this for my ""rain bike"" which I wash down after every ride, then splash this on the chain for a quick lube. I use a different product on my other bikes, which I dab onto the chain, instead of using this spray can. It seems to be a decent lube, if not a little thin. However, I don't like how powerful the spray is. It gets everywhere, even if I hold a towel behind the chain to catch the excess. Thankfully my rain bike is a singlespeed w/o a rear brake, because this stuff gets all over the rear wheel's rim, and that would be dangerous if I had a rear rim brake...Guess I should not be lazy and just use the lube that dabs on, even if it takes 2 minutes instead of 20 seconds... I don't recommend this for any bike with a rear rim brake or any bike you don't want getting lube all over."
5,Science Meets Spirituality,"Blanchard's work candidly reveals one man's personal journey toward spiritual awakening, and demonstrates that the order and maginficence of the universe that ""science"" is just now discovering has its basis in spiritual energy and that sprituality and scientific principle, which seem at odds to many of us, complement and reinforce one another in ways not previously explored."
4,A more two-steo style of feel and a return back to the groups roots,"With the release of ""BRAND NEW TOMORROW"", the 11th CD single from the group would debut at #1 on the Oricon Charts.It was also another song since ""survival dAnce"" that would feature a song that you can hear TK sing clearly in the chorus.With ""Overnight Sensation"" utilizing the funky live house band feel, ""BRAND NEW TOMORROW"" would have a two-step type of feel and return the group to their synth pop dance roots.The song would still incorporate a bit of the funkiness found on their previous CD single, so ""BRAND NEW TOMORROW"" would seem like a perfect marriage between the music of TRF's present and past.But if one would think that TRF was going to go back to its roots of synth pop in their next CD single, they would be wrong because ""BRAND NEW TOMORROW"" would be the last CD single to retain the TRF sound that people knew and love.The group would venture into new territory with their next CD single."
2,Great Songs (Revised Review),"I loved the song selections and I originally did not give this album a good review. However, my daughter and her 15 month old baby just love the songs and they play and sing these songs all the time. I am revising my review and now want to give it FOUR STARS instead of two (but I can't seem to revise the number of stars). The album, the songs, and the music are lots of fun."
1,Disapointing,"Sorry, the singing is just terrible, and I'm sorry I spent the money on it. I was planing on sending it to family with little ones, but once I heard it, I changed my mind!"
4,Estelle - kids songs,"This isn't the first album I would suggest, but it'll do. My neice and nephew's favorite is Philadelphia Chickens, which isn't annoying to listen to as an adult. Quite catchy actually..."
3,Opinion on Songs for Kids CD,"I enjoyed it very much, and appreciate your type of sound. Unfortunately, the children were more interested in BARNEY or ELMO.I feel terrible because when your Dear husband was on the Ellen show, he mentioned your CD and I had been seeking an idea for 2 children's b-day gifts - age 4.I apologize, but I ended up giving them cartoon movies."
5,Kids will love writing using these exercises,"Using a unique approach by connecting children's writing with real authors' experiences, this book has an attractive layout and provides interesting information about 20 notable children's authors. Children have stories to tell and they can easily become successful writers when motivated. The lessons suggested by these authors will steer children in the direction of imaginative and thoughtful writing."
3,A Nice Collection,"This album was to be one of projected series of 20 CDs of ""The World's Greates Popular Standards"" and this album has the elan usually found in new albums from old composers and orchestra leaders. Philip Green was near the end of his career when he recorded this album and his experience shows in the details of his music. A good sound and recommended for those who like popular music without the elevator sound."
1,The worst movie I've ever seen,Putrid. Unfunny. Pathetic. I've seen lots of bad movies in my time (55 years) but this one put all the other bad movies to shame! Zero stars.
1,Very Bad.,"I paid $1 rental fee for this movie. I feel I should be compensated for the half hour I forced myself to watch. Non-sense, non-funny, and incredibly odd."
1,"don't buy it, don't watch it","Hollywood thinks big stars, minimal plot and stupid, bathroom humor make a movie. The characters are not likable. This is not a clever comedy. This is like an ADHD addict on drugs, disjointed, at lot of energy, and doesn't make much sense. Not even enjoyable or funny to watch. Irritating. All of these stars are capable of performing in good roles in good movies. This isn't one of them. don't waste your time watching this trash on cable."
1,Can I rate a movie MINUS five stars?,"Leave it to Hollywood to come up with a movie featuring four stars I love (Farrell, Wahlberg, Jackson, The Rock) that is incomprehensible, implausible and completely unwatchable after about the first 45 seconds. That's why it's so cheap so fast, and honestly, it wouldn't be a good buy at $0.12. NEXT!"
1,A mess,"The writers here should congratulate themselves on making one of the most incomprehensible comedies of all time. Normally I would give a lot of credit to a film which really tried to address the current thievery going on in Wall Street firms, but the insertion of these complex themes into a slapstick buddy cop film is exactly the train wreck you would expect it to be.Aside from the absurdity regarding the overall theme, the storyline rumbles along from one scene to the next with no continuity. The jokes are unfunny and painfully lame. The acting? Phoned in performances across the board."
1,TERRIBLE,"Ok let me start off by stating I have loved, I mean really loved all Will Ferrell movies and all his SNL skits.. Seriously this was the worst movie I have ever seen in my 32 yrs on this earth. I kept watching only hoping it would start to get good, did not happen! I don't know how this could be so bad considering the amazing cast, please do not be fooled by the names in this movie. All writers and directors were high or really drunk when written/made. Acting was bad, nothing to do with the actors, pretty sure it was just the script."
4,Unexpectedly good,"Don't get me wrong, my wife and I are big fans of Will Farrell. Even when the movies themselves aren't great, he makes us laugh. I completely realize that there are people who don't like Farrell -- but this movie might -- MIGHT -- make those people laugh. Here Mark Wahlberg takes on the more outburst-y role while Farrell plays it a bit more reserved. Both roles give these guys moments to shine.I actually didn't expect this movie to be as good as it turned out -- it seemed a little below the radar leading up to its release. But it has all the stuff that makes a Farrell movie great -- repeatable lines, improvised stuff, and perhaps best of all his relationship with his wife and Wahlberg's response to the ludicrous nature of it.Anyway -- worth renting if you haven't seen it, and worth getting for those Farrell-friends that you have in your life!"
1,"Sorry, slap stick humor with nothing beteen scenes","This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year. I have deeply enjoyed both of the lead actors in the past and they have given stellar performances in other movies. That being said they were the wrong people for this movie, (they did not look the part) and the story had too many ""blank spots"" where nothing was happening... other than Jerry Lewis silly slap-stick humor. If there was a story or plot, I missed it, and there was to much air between the funny parts. Even the car crashes were so ""technically augmented"" with tight shots and smearing video that the ""apparent action"" was a waste of time. Sorry, save your money and buy some candy outside the movie theater instead."
2,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,Yes the movie was meant to be a spoof....and yes I actually chuckled a few times but it was just SO bad. Do NOT spend your hard-earned money on purchasing this unless you've actually seen it and think it's great.
4,Very enjoyable,"Diff't types of comedies resonate differently w/people. While I hated ""The 40-year Old Virgin"", I thought ""The Other Guys"" was very funny. This looked like a fun movie to film (would love to see outtakes), and I too was drawn into the hilarity of the scenes. Mark Wahlberg was perfect as Ferrell's angry/bitter cop-partner--Mark's facial expressions alone had me laughing, esp, since his character is so unlike anything I've seen from him. Much of the comedy was in the indirect references vs. the blatant outright lines. Dwayne Johnson and Samuel Jackson were awesome as tough macho cops. True, there are some slow parts but definitely worth a rental. Watch 'til the end (through the credits)."
2,Surprisingly Awful,"I rented this movie expecting a funny, well-done comedy. Instead what I got was spots of awful acting, unfunny scenes and sequences, and many awkward, unconfortable moments.I actually could not finish watching it. That's right, I turned it off before it was over-and I almost never do that. (I even watched the whole movie of ""All About Steve""). It's too bad because the ideas and concepts of the movie could have been very funny but they simply are so poorly done that it is a really bad movie.Honestly, I am embarrassed for the actors involved, especially Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, Michael Keaton, and Eva Mendes. I really like Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, but this movie was horrendous.The only reason I gave my review 2 stars instead of 1 star is because I remember laughing really hard at two jokes/sequences at the very beginning of the movie-but I can't even remember what they were now.Please don't waste the time-You will regret wasting your life."
4,Very Funny!!!,"I thought this movie was incredibly funny. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg were awesome together. This movie has just as much action as it does comedy. Detectives Terry Hoitz and Allen Gamble are stuck behind a desk and want a piece of the action. When their idols, Danson and Highsmith die, Gamble and Hoitz decide to step up. (I love how they don't get along in the beginning, and are always at each others throats) They try to bring down a billionaire investment banker named David Ershon. If you love comedy, and action, you'll love THE OTHER GUYS!!!"
5,Hillarious!,I thought the film was great. I am a Will Farrell fan and enjoy his humor and this one didn't let me down.
5,Best Comedy in a LONG time!,"I didn't expect much out of this movie. Will Farrell has disappointed me in many movies before and I am not a huge fan of Mark Wahlberg because I always see him as the creepy guy in ""Fear"". But, I watched this movie last weekend and I laughed so hard during it that tears were constantly streaming down my face. There are so many outlandishly funny parts and many subtly funny parts that it makes for a perfect comedy. Will Farrell and Mark Wahlberg have a great dynamic and I would like to see them together again in the future. The timing is perfect, the humor is outrageous, and the characters are well developed. I love the ending song ""Pimps Don't Cry"". When Eva Mendes sang it, the whole time I was wondering, ""Is this a REAL song?"" Apparently it is, and it was so funny hearing it at the end. Watch this movie at least once. I purchased it a day after I watched it and it is a favorite in my household already!"
2,Meh,"Wanted to laugh super hard and didn't. Not half as funny as Talladega Nights, Blades of Glory, or Step Brothers."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,This movie had stupid humor. Can't believe Mark Walburg lowered his standards to do this.This went right in the trash.
5,Very funny stuff!,"Great movie for a laugh, love that two very talented actors worked so well together. Both are known for the different types of casting, but the two together was genius!"
4,Hilarious Flick,"This movie was FUNNY! Not Step Brothers funny, but damn close. The 2 goof balls in the movie complement each other very well. Simply, It works!"
3,Like a soda can that's been left open too long ...,"This movie lived down to its expectations.The preview was all hype which immediately led me to beware.You could watch the preview & be done with it.It commenced with Samuel Jackson & The Rock being bad S.That lasted about 10 minutes until they checked out.There's originality & good material, but it doesn't coagulate.It's like the entire cast had to take a dump, but was told to hold it.Everybody was holding back which made the movie uncomfortable.The same gags pervaded the movie, but as tired as I was last night, I didn't laugh.I wanted & needed such, but no such luck.At best, I cracked a grin & grimaced."
2,Greatly Disappointed!,"Sad to say I expected a lot out of this movie. I heard several good things and some of the previews for The Other Guys provided a nice chuckle or two, but this movie as a whole did not perform up to expectations.Now, first of all I'll admit I love Will Ferrell movies. Okay, maybe not all of them. But yes, he makes me laugh. I loved Taladega Nights and Step Brothers has become one of my all time faves. This one though, not so much. There are some funny bits here and there. Mark Wahlberg, Eva Mendes, and Michael Keaton provided some funny moments with their respective characters, but not enough to for me to enjoy the film. If you like funny buddy cop movies and want to laugh, then maybe this might work for you. But really, you could probably do better with something else. The Other Guys flat out under-delivered!"
4,"i liked it, better than ferrell's recent movies.","of course it's silly! it's will ferrell! but at least this one had an inkling of a script and some very funny lines. mark wahlberg's character was weird but some of the other stuff was so off the wall it caught me by surprise! when i saw it, i needed the laughs and it did not disappoint."
5,So Great I Watched it Twice,"I was on a flight from LAX to New York and this was playing on the airplane. I could not stop laughing during this movie and watched it twice just to relive the antics, hear the one liners and see if I could catch Wahlberg laughing while trying to keep a straight face. The reason this is funny is because there are so many references to old TV shows, famous TV personalities, typical story lines and cultural values (which are basically screwed up). Of course, it is over the top but that is Will Ferrell's trademark. The casting is on target and the one liners are continuous. I cannot recommend this movie enough - especially in DVD format to watch it again and again!"
1,is the writer's strike still going on?,"this movie is aweful, laughed once or twice. I like both main actor's but together they are aweful. idk whos fault it is this movie was horid but they need to be removed from film production ASAP."
1,bomb bomb bomb,will ferrell is very funny. but this movie just bombed plain and simple. screenplay was just poorly composed. what a waste of talent.
1,Made my #1 worst movie ever seen,"Overdone, obvious bad humor, tasteless and unfunny. My girlfriend and I toughed it out until halfway and then turned it off. It worries me that some people find this movie humorous and entertaining.I even like Will Farrell."
5,Brilliant,"I could not stop laughing throughout this movie.The Blu-Ray visuals are obviously stunning, but the main reason to purchase this is purely for the comedy.Extras are a blast to watch also."
4,good product,got here fast and the product was as described so overall very nice and happy I got it. good buy
4,Good stuff,"Actually has a good plot, more than most movies of this type. Some strange jokes, but it was a well done action movie."
5,hilarious,"Whats not to love about this movie. It's Hilarious.I sometimes catch portions of this flick while watching TV. The laughs and characters come so frequently its for sure entertainment every time, dos'nt matter what part or how much I watch.Eve Mendes. Steven Koogan. Michael Keaton. All the character actors/actresses in this film shine with great parts.Really really well done hollywood comedy.Cheers."
2,"Digital version expires Dec 12, 2011","I loved the movie-- but, of course, Will Ferrell is an acquired taste. I'm giving this product 2 stars because the digital version had to be activated/transferred by Dec 12, 2011. It didn't say that on the box or description!"
2,"It's a cartoon - funny now and then, but not much more","A live-action cartoon with genuinely funny moments, not least the A-Team moments (lots of them) where dozens of automatic weapons fire nonstop and nobody gets even a scratch. Cars plow through other cars and even buildings, and everybody walks away grinning and unscathed. Formulaic soundtrack included at no extra charge. And at the end, the tired old capitalists-are-bad construction from, forever ironically, wealthy Hollywood-based capitalists; all the bad stuff was the result of Evil Corporations. I'm shocked, I tell you, shocked!For some reason this lowbrow crap continues to sell. Glad I invested no more than a Netflix rental queue slot."
3,Everything I Expect From A Will Farrel Movie,"I can say that I enjoy every Will Farrell movie I watch, yet this one was not at the top of the list.As for a buddy cop movie, Will and Mark Wahlberg make a great comic pair, especially seeing Mark so out of his usual realm. There are plenty of decent sight gags and lots of good dialogue.Maybe it was just too silly. I fell asleep halfway through it and awoke with about 10 minutes to go. I can't really fault the movie as much as just being tired, but it were that good, I think I would have stayed awake better. Not to condemn it, but it wasn't quite as good as Ricky Bobby.I still think this is a solid comedy, especially for Will Farrell fans. I'd consider watching it again just to see what I missed. Recommended."
3,Thought it would be better,"Wow, I had heard this was a good movie, but it was not very funny. It's worth it if you get rent it for a dollar."
3,A few good laughs,"Not a bad comedy, but the funny moments were hit or miss for me. I should admit that I am a tough audience and the the girl I watched it with thought it was hilarious. She did however admit her disappointment that Whalberg looked fat. But hey, maybe he was trying to look more like a cop."
4,"""Pretty Good Action-Comedy!""","Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg star in this 2010 action-comedy.Two desk-duty cops try to solve a case and be like 2 latesupercops. This is pretty good and Will and Mark are greattogether. This dvd not only has nice picture and sound, butrated and unrated versions plus neat extras. I recommendthis."
3,I liked it. Will Ferrell rarely became annoying.,"I don't like Will Ferrell movies. Almost without exception I don't like them. I usually avoid them. I do like Mark Wahlberg, though, and know he has good comic timing and delivery so ... what the hell. I liked it. Will Ferrell rarely became annoying as an actor and was only appropriately annoying as the character. Wahlberg delivered a comic performance beyond even what I expected. There was some fine stuntwork and plenty of good supporting performances. Not a great movie, but well worth seeing."
4,"Mixed feelings, but overall very good","i was at first thinking this was a bit of a mess (took two sittings to finish the movie) but now that i think back, it really was pretty entertainingi really enjoyed the TLC references and loved how Mark Wahlberg would say things like:""I know how to play the harp because i took classes so i can make fun of the gay kid down the block"""
2,Slow and Not So Funny,"I expected so much better than what this movie gave. The previews looked so promising and the movie did not deliver. Mark Wahlberg called in his performance coming across as robotic at times when delivering his lines. The worst part is they held Will Ferrell back, almost as if they put a muzzle on him and did not allow him to do what he does best, go crazy and be funny. They had him playing almost the straight man which is completely a waste of his talent. There were a few clever, funny bits especially with Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson but not enough to save this movie. I don't recommend this movie if you are looking for a ""normal"" Will Ferrel movie, he is not there."
3,Suggested Purchase,Wasn't happy with the intended purpose of this movie. It is funny in a Will Ferrell sort of way. Not a huge fan of his. Probably wouldn't have purchased if had looked more carefully at the content.
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The video arrived in a very fancy plastic holder. Interestingly enough in addition to the plastic holder it was then encased in a very high tech plasticy substance. This company goes above and beyond when it comes to packaging. They are obviously on the cutting edge in the packaging arena. Kudos to them for having the forethought to hermetically seal this product. I am yet to view this movie, but I'm sure it's fine."
4,Good Action Comedy,"You will either love or hate this movie, there is not much room in between.There is some foul language, so it is not a family movie. But the script is real funny, I liked the one liners, they are original.Lots of action in the beginning of the movie, and after that it slows down now and then, but I thought it was an entertaining movie.Few references to bail outs does not make it a political movie.Casting and acting was great. All in all, it is a light hearted action comedy not to be taken seriously."
1,Gross - Couldn't finish watching,"I thought the movie would get better. It only got worse and worse. Whould have been rated ""R"""
1,Horrible,I am really disappointed with this movie Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell are two of my favorite actors. This movie really was the dumbest movie that I have ever seen
1,A Bunch of Sketches thrown together,"This movie was BAD. It seemed like a bunch of deleted scenes,that how bad this was.The movie doesnt go at a great pace and is lost with all the terrible humor and jokes that are quite forgettable as well.Do yourself a BIG favor and possibly rent this and save your money and time too."
1,I wasted $3 renting this crap,"I have never been a fan of Will Ferrel's comedy. I just don't get him, he's NOT funny at all. Yet there always seems to be a movie with him releasing once every year or two. I rented this hoping that Mark W. co-star will probably make a decent action-comedy to watch and i was so wrong. The start of the movie with action scene was a good start and i was hoping for more but throughout the entire 90 mins, it was just BAD humor. I will never buy/rent any movie with him again.If you want to waste $$ purchasing this, I suggest go rent it first before you buy."
2,A Comedy That Is NOT Very Funny by any stretch..,"This past weekend, at a random theatre, to see this ""hit"" movie, only the best parts R before The Rock (D. Johnson and his partner R killed in the film).. Which is ""The Other Guys"" premise.. Simply toilet humor, grade scholl junk.. Not impressed and Wills' career is on life support.."
1,How About ZERO Stars?,"Wasted good money watching this in the theatre and it was horrible, other than the whole wife thing with Eva Mendes, this film was an absolute piece of garbage and I wouldn't own this movie in my collection if you paid me. Will is getting worse and worse and Mark needs to STOP DOING COMEDY!! Dude you are NOT funny!!!"
1,"I should have rented ""The Other Movie!""","I put one star, only because Amazon will not let you put zero. This was a terrible movie. The three or four funny moments in no way made up for the fact that this movie flat out sucked. The plot was non-existant, which I could overlook if the movie is one funny scence after another, this was not. I am so glad that I waited to get it from Redbox, and didn't waste $20 at the movie theater. Badly timed humor litters this movie. It is like a bad SNL sketch that just keeps going and going. Do not rent / watch this movie, you will be disapointed. If you want to see a good Will Ferrell movie, watch Step-Brothers (that is a laught a minute movie from start to finish). If you want a good Mark Wahlberg flick, then chose The Fighter, or The Departed."
2,Not that great!,"I was looking forward to this movie. It sounded pretty good. But for an action comedy, there is little action and most of the comedy just falls flat. Will Farrell was just not funny in this one. Mark Wahlberg is actually kinda funny in this. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,"72 five stars, and 49 one stars so you do the math","To me I am going to give this movie a three star. I do not know if this tells you anything or not but I bought it at the $7.00 discount rack at the gas station, and it is by far not the worst movie I have seen, and it is by far not the best. I expected that it would have been funny, and kind of expected that Ferrell would have been a get smart type of detective while Wahlberg would have been the tough cop, and that is sort of the way it went.The plot of the movie with them chasing after a wall street ponzi scheme guy did not make a lot of sense, and it got dry and dragged on throughout the movie. However, Ferrell was funny as was Wahlberg.Do the math, and you will see 3 stars is where it belongs."
1,this movie sucks,"so boring, so slow, so stupid... I'd rather watch the HANGOVER or StepBrothers again for the 99th time. Normally i LOVE this style of movie, but this just sucked."
1,Such a waste,"I realize everyone has different tastes, but I should have known better before spending $5.00 to watch another humorless and tactless Will Ferrel film. We found practically not a single moment that could even illicit a smile, let alone a belly laugh. There is absolutely nothing about this film that I could recommend, it has no energy, no color, and the attempts at humor play like a home-made film from a midwestern middle school. The senseless attempts at comic relief function at no more than an adolescent level, and yet much of the the content is adult.This is a terrible film, and not worth $.99, let alone 4 or 5 dollars."
1,Ho-Hum,"I was determined to watch the end; however, I must have pushed the pause button a million times (even to write this review--not at the end yet, but I'm going to get there). One reviewer wrote he or she laughed twice. All I can say is that I am jealous of that person since I didn't laugh once. I don't know what to say other than this movie was (is) surprising bad, but I am determined to get to the end...I don't know why."
2,Don't watch the Unrate Version,"This movie sucked in my opinion. It had maybe only 2 really good funny moments but I ended up more bored than laughing. The unrated version (in not the entire movie) was yet another Will Ferrell going on and on and on where I'm just like please make this stop. The concept is attracting, but the execution was very poor."
1,Biggest disappointment in recent history,I really wanted to like this movie. Will F. has done some great comedies. Mark W. has done some great cop movies. Together they made a flop of cop comedy. Turned it off 30 minutes in.
4,Other Guys,"Surprisingly funny film for what I was expecting. Roommate, some friends and I all enjoyed it over drinks and dinner. Case it comes in seems cheap though, it doesn't seem like a standard blu ray case which actually might protect your disk."
2,not worth the time,"Due to the actors, I was initially skeptical when a friend brought this movie over to watch, and it did exceed my expectations. There were many funny lines in the movie, but the humor could not compare to the boring story. The acting was lacking, the plot predictable, and the overall film was drawn out and dull. That being said, if you are a fan of Will Ferrell, I'd give the film a shot because it is similar to many of his other movies."
2,The Other Guys Disappointed,"We were looking forward to watching this movie...Will Farrell and Mark Wahlberg are 2 of our favorites. We were disappointed in this movie; the comedy to us was flat and kind of boring. Sometimes, however, a repeated viewing helps you appreciate a movie more, so maybe we should give it another try. We bought the DVD, so we might try checking it out again. On first view, I would rate it 2 stars."
5,Great Will Ferrel Movie,This movie is an all around favorite with both guy's and girl's humor. I just love Will Ferrel movies he is one funny guy.
4,Over the top funny,"This movie goes way, way over the top in so many places, yet it's also hilarious. It spoofs not only the typical cop movies (especially with the brilliant intro starring the Rock and Samuel L. Jackson), but also other cop comedy/action movies. The script writers for this movie are amazingly creative - or insane. Two bum cops start to investigate a huge financial scam. The plot isn't great, but the jokes are nuts. Will Farrell also does a pretty good job with his character, unlike a lot of his movies where he overdoes it. Overall, if you're in the mood for a dumb but hilarious movie, check The Other Guys out."
3,big loud action comedy like BEVERLY HILLS COP,"This is like the current generation's BEVERLY HILLS COP: a big, broad, loud action comedy. For the 15-year-old in everyone. Sure, it's funny, but dumb/funny, never smart/funny. But hey, I didn't turn it off. Best scene: Ferrell describing why the Female Body Inspector mug is funny. C+ or 6/10."
5,Funny Film,"This movie is right up my alley. I love the raunchy comedy without it being to bad. Is this not a movie you would want to let your children watch, but it is a good funny spin off of cop movies."
3,Needs more editing,"My husband and I are fans of Mark Wahlberg and my children are fans of Will Ferrell. This movie, with both actors together, did not deliver the movie as a comedy, nor as an action flick. I think it's due to lack of editing on the film. Some scenes should've been shorter (i.e. the scene where Ferrell's elderly mother-in-law kept coming back to deliver the message from his wife, played by beautiful Eva Mendes, to him and vice versa. The scene was repeated one too many times. We all rolled our eyes - enough already!) The movie has lots of car chases and action, and there were some funny moments. But all in all, it left us with a ho-hum reaction."
4,Awesome!,"Mark Walberg is hilarious, and Will Ferrell is such a great staight man in this movie! The whole thing is so ridiculous that you have to laugh!!"
5,Funny!,I caught it on tv one day and loved it so much I had to buy a copy so I could watch it at anytime. Love Will Ferrell. Different role for Mark Walberg but he pulled it off. I was really impressed.
4,Nice Headset/Microphone,"This is a nice headset/microphone. The speakers cover my ears well enough to block out any background noise. You hear everything with little to no static or white noise - really impressed with that. I've only used the micrphone a few times and the sound it captures isn't very good. I'm going to be working on my computer settings to see if I can improve the recording volume. I'm certain I can make the sound capture better. Regardless of that, I would buy this again if I had to."
2,Terrible Ambience,"These headphones really lack when it comes to the gaming realm and anything else you do. Some Audio is great, but there is too much ambience and possible sound delay in these headphones. I'm not sure how to pinpoint it, but these headphones do not have good clarity. They're like two speakers in a small room and it's very irritating since I paid for headphones not damn speakers.They hurt the hell out of my ears, my brother says they're ok on him, but he also notices the terrible ambience that drowns out clarity. I tried every mixer setting I could pull out of my butt to fix it, but nothing worked.I highly suggest you look elsewhere for headphones, Altec Lansing did not produce a good product here."
5,Good video,Steve is a great guy to get lessons from. He explains things really well. On occasion it goes a little fast for my ability and he assumes you know basic things about the guitar.
1,Do not buy a McCulloch pressure washer,"McCulloch pressure washers have a fragile plastic part that links the generally robust metal motor and metal pump to the pressure switch that cuts power to the motor when pressure is attained. In operation, the plastic part is prone to bursting -- and if it does you can't replace it.I have an older model that is just beyond warrantee. In NORMAL OPERATION the plastic part burst. I am told that my model is no longer made, that many people ask for this part, and they are SOL. I am also told that McCulloch pressure washers are still made with this plastic linkage.This likely explains Jazzman's problem.By the way, McCulloch was purchased by the Taiwan company Jenn Feng."
3,Two stars or Three?,"I already have a heavy duty gas powered pressure washer, so when I got this as a gift from my parents I graciously accepted it but didn't expect much. But guess what? This thing worked like a charm. I used it to clean places that a heavy gas powered unit would just be too unwieldy to use and I used it to clean my boat before, during and after the season. Much lighter and easier to use than the gas powered where you have to mix gas and oil, and it kept everything looking just as great.Why only 2-3 stars then? The brass hose connection on the unit or the hose threads inside the pressure hose are easily damaged. I was always careful about threading things together and even more so once it seemed to be becoming more of a probelm. But in just 2 years of use, the pressure hose will no longer thread onto the unit, making a once very nice product unusable. 3 or even 4 stars if it could still be used; 2 or 3 stars now."
1,LASTED 20 MINUTES,"First used it today bought it on July 8th lasted for 20 minutes before it self destucted, need I say more, you get what you pay for.."
2,You get what you pay for,"Bought this one 2 years ago. Not enough pressure to clean my car. Now, the spray gun is cracked and water spraying all over the place. I will buy a universal spray gun and hopefuly the motor doesn't die soon."
1,Worst choice - useless,"I bought couple of these and for both I noticed they quickly deteriorated after couple of weeks. The lamplight became dim and I was wondering if I am slowly getting blind. I examined the bulbs and noticed the tube tarnished inside by a mirror-black residue - presumable film from metal evaporation, because it was not there when I bought them. When you turn the light on, it takes couple of seconds to light up, when turned off - it continues glowing for up to five seconds. This is not how halogen bulbs should be!I replaced the Feit bulb with another brand and guess what? The non-Feit 150W bulb is BRIGHTER than the Feit 300W!Do not buy Feit halogen bulbs.PS. no, the tarnish was not due to fingerprint residue - it was all over the bulb, not localized spot. the new brand i tried was GE Edison if i remember."
3,Looking at the Eucharist in a different way...,"I am a Catholic priest. Our diocese in Mississippi is celebrating the year of the Eucharist this year, so I have read this book and other books on the Eucharist in order to gain new perspectives. I like the concept of this book, of looking at all the aspects of the Eucharist in the meals Christ shared with others both before and after his death and resurrection, as well as the implications this has for the way we live out the Eucharist in our lives. However, while the author did a nice job, I did not find anything really new that I had not heard before. For those not too familiar with this type of biblical analysis, and for the ways the Eucharist could be applied in our lives, perhaps this would be a good introduction. However, for me, I did not gain much from reading this book. I did like the author's new perspective on the parable of the virgins with their lamps awaiting the bridegroom's arrival."
5,AoB Rules,"Ace of Base is my favorite band. I might just be an enthusiastic fan, but I really liked this book! You should read it today!"
5,Life changing book!,"This book reminded me that we are all connected. I read it before bedtime and it was comforting, almost like a lullaby. I would highly recommend this book to anyone searching for acceptance, universality, and meaning for life's challenges."
1,It never really worked,"Let me take this opportunity to praise Amazon's return policy. This thing only costs a few dollars, and it wasn't worth my time to pack it up and return it, having just returned a couple other things. But the radio doesn't work.* You cannot manually tune up or down.* When you press the scan button, there is a long delay before a station is found.* STATIC and uneven volumeI live in major metropolitan area of the U.S, and other radios work fine in the same location. Fresh batteries did not help. This thing is a dud."
3,Very elementary,So elementary and simplified that it was of no use to me. I guess it's ok for very small children whose parents want to introduce them to the basic idea.
5,A guide to unique sites,"Don't think this is a modern restaurant guide, though you'll find many of NOLA ""Institutions"" described -- Antoine's, Commander's Palace, etc. But if you're interested in history, you'll enjoy it. I am a photographer and historian, and have enjoyed finding special little places with it. The book is small, so it fits into a (big) pocket."
2,It's halogen,Problem: I moved into an apartment with ceiling fixtures (yay!) that use halogen bulbs (boo).Solution: Suck it up and use the halogen. I am hopeful there will be a dimmable LED equivalent (150W equivalents) someday. Mean while these do the trick.
2,LASTED 1 DAY,Bulbs were received on time. Installed 2 bulbs and 1 lasted only 1 day. Same thing happened last time I ordered these bulbs (1 lasted only 2 weeks). Would not recommend these bulbs!
5,PERFECT,THIS IS THE PERFECT REPLACEMENT FOR OUR NIGHT LIGHT IN OUR GARAGE...IT WAS JUST AS BRIGHT AS THE ONE I SPENT $10 ON AND I GOT 2 FOR THE PRICE OF 1.
5,"Feit Electric BPQ150T3/CL/S/RS/2 150-Watt T3 Rough Service Halogen Bulb with RSC Base, Clear, 2 Pack",Ordered the bulbs Monday night and received them in the mail Thursday afternoon. Excellent service! The bulbs came in their original package which was placed in a separate bubble-wrap package inside the protective mail pouch. Both bulbs appear to be in perfect shape. The filaments and end caps are good.I will continue to order through Amazon.com and would recommend them to everyone!
1,Something that should be purchased locally...,I can't say if this product works well or not. I ordered these bulbs as a replacement and hoped they would last because the lights are not in a location that easy to access. Removed the lights and prepared to replace the bulbs and found one bulb broken and one with a broken filament. These bulbs must not ship well as the ones I was replacing were in lights that I purchased from Amazon and used for less than a month. Save yourself the hassle of return shipping and purchase locally.
4,Lasts a long time,I haven't had to buy a replacement bulb for my kitchen light in over 3 years. That's a pretty long life for a halogen lightbulb. I like this brand and like the price. Am very happy with this.
3,Ever increasing costs,"Looked at these Feit halogen bulbs just a few days ago and finally got around to ordering them. To my surprise, the price had already jumped up 26% in just a few days from what they were previously advertised for! It use to be that it was not that shocking when you'd see prices rise maybe 5% - 10% over a period of many months or sometimes in a year or two. But during the last year or so, I've personally experienced price increases on regular-use products escalate as much as 53% in a single wack. Too bad our employers won't accept these economic factors and increase our salaries a commensurate amount accordingly. I guess profit margins and greed will always rule."
3,Still filled with information,The low tech blast from the past on how it was done and ideas and information on how it can still be done. With modern common knowledge and past know how this one is worthwhile.
3,"Good book , no illatrrations",This is a great book . The problem is that the book will refer to illustration fig. 10 but the illustration is no where to be found. All I can think of is the the publisher did not print the illustrations with the rest of the book.
2,half a loaf,It is a nice pad holder but why do they sell it without the stem that goes into the sander? Do they think we have spare ones hanging around?3M 04801105674 4 X 5/8-11 Hook & Loop Disc Pad Holder #9143M 04801105679 5 X 1/2-13 Hook & Loop Disc Pad Holder #915
5,WOW,"This is probably my favorite Newsboys cd! Its just plain GREAT! My favorite song on the cd is I Cannot Get You Out Of My System, its Excellent! Great beats, very good messages, and well worth the money, man!"
5,Newsboys-Not Ashamed,"This is a great CD. Yeah it's older, but it is full of catchy tunes and has cool lyrics full of satire. This CD reflects the ""Austrailian"" in them more than their later music. It is very full of energy and guitar."
4,An excellent debut by a top-notch Christian band!,"The Newsboys Not Ashamed is full of great pop/dance beats and meaningful, searching lyrics. The title track is likely the most popular (and one of the best) songs ever written by a Christian pop artist. Definitely worth it."
5,VERY VALUABLE CD.,"""Not Ashamed"" is the second CD released by the Newsboys and it is a very good CD (especially for a sophomore effort). The Newsboys deliver a very exciting marriage of lyrics and music on such songs as the title track (one of the best songs ever recorded by anyone) and their re-do of the classic hymn ""Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus"". All other songs are good as well. Highly Recommended!"
4,Great fast-paced music with an Australian kick,"I originally had this album on cassette, but recently bought the CD because I love it so much. I like the positive message, the fast dance-clubish beat, and the in-your-face lyrics.It's a really great album to listen to as you work out or walk. I recommend this and many other Newsboys albums.Not Ashamed"
4,Let's Dance!,"This cd is Great for a chance to party! All the songs are great hits and without it, my party would have been dead! Celebration and Scatman were the highlights of the cd!"
4,Health and Wellness DVD review,"This DVD contained some very helpful information. I found the nutrition segment valuable. I was not really into the whole ""meditate and let your mind encompass the universe"" stuff, though. Some people might find that interesting. The yoga segments were useful."
2,Readable but you can find better books out there....,"This book had a promising concept but failed to deliver. It was self absorbed (addressing the reader does nothing for me except make me cringe), time consuming (I never really cared what was going to happen to the characters which made me wonder what else I could be doing besides reading this book), and unrealistic (as other reviewers have said...how is it possible that he wasn't recognized by anyone??).On a positive note...I would try another book by this author. He seems to have good ideas for books and perhaps will mature in his writing skill as time progresses."
3,"Great premise, disappointing story","The premise for this book seemed really interesting to me, but overall, I found the main character and Alice (his love interest) to be dull. I found Max Tivoli to be incredibly selfish and therefore felt little sympathy towards him.Also, this book contains scenes of graphic animal cruelty. I would not have read this book if I had known ahead of time and would not recommend it to people sensitive to animal abuse."
5,Brilliant book,"I loved this book! The prose is beautifully written and the story is very interesting. It really gripped me. I've often thought about the idea of 'reverse aging', and heretofore, thought it would be better than the usual aging process. How great would it be to look forward to getting older!...to be in your teens and 20s with all that wisdom. But this book certainly made me reconsider. I just finished reading it this morning and I am still thinking about the story. Very poignant and somewhat tragic. I can't say it was a feel good read, but it made an indelible impression on me."
3,"""Interesting concept but left me wanting more""","I picked up this book because I thought the concept was interesting, and after reading the first chapter I was hooked, and decided to buy it. I liked the setting of the book - late 1800's in San Francisco, but after finishing the book, I was disappointed with the ending. I felt like I was left with a lot of questions that could have been answered in a simple epilogue of sorts. But overall, it was a different read, and I'm glad that I read something out of my normal genres. Hope that helps!"
4,I waited a week before reviewing this beautiful novel...,"Because I've made the mistake of fawning over a book, then fading in my enthusiasm, I decided to give it some time before hopping around with excitement. If anything, my memory of the story has warmed. You can read elsewhere about the novel's conceit. Andrew Sean Greer's talent is in making that conceit work so well - and doing it with style and language that just glows. Here's a warning: I felt somewhat confused and skeptical for the first third of the book. This is, again, one of those novels that you need to embrace for long stretches, as the atmosphere is designed to pull you in, not just entertain you for a few pages at a time as you doze off before bed. If you commit to the book, you'll be overcome with real emotion in the final third of the story. (I zipped out and bought Greer's first novel just to make sure I'd have it when the mood hit me.)"
4,Clever Idea for a Novel,"Which came first: Max Tivoli or Time Traveler's Wife? The truth is that to me it doesn't really matter which was published first; what matters is what I read first and that was Time Traveler's Wife. Consequently, Max feels like an uglier younger sister. Max is the story of a man whose body ages backwards; that is, Max is born old and gradually becomes younger and younger. Complicating his life is his love for a woman who, sadly, ages normally. The idea for the story is clever and Max is a sympathetic figure, butI never had that can't-put-the-book-down feeling."
2,"Enchanting, but BORing!!!","Yes, the writing is exquisite and enchanting, and I really wanted to ""like"" this book, but it is a TOTALLY BORing story. I could not and did not want to finish this book. I am referring to the audio CD version. For me, a ""good"" book is one that makes me want to rush to my car before work/after work/on shopping trips to hear the next installment. Having ""Max"" in the CD drive, I walked a little more slowly, took fewer shopping trips. This book was a chore to listen to."
1,Wins the prize for most maudlin book ever...,"Bleh! I don't understand the glowing reviews. The idea behind this book could have made for an excellent story; but the main character, Max Tivoli, is horrible. He is a weepy, miserable whiner. Sure the writing is colorful, but that doesn't make up for Max's incessant complaining. Even when he is supposed to be happy he comes across as miserable and utterly pessimistic. The entire book essentially consists of the main character/narrator feeling sorry for himself.Couldn't stand this book."
4,A spellbinding book,"Warning - once you start this book you will not be able to put it down. It pulls you in from the very start. Although the plot might seem farfetched, the simply stated dialogue and sympathetic narrator had me connected from the start. You feel for Max because he is growing up with a huge secret he can't share and yet his struggles mirror our own. The love story that weaves throughout his life is beautiful yet tragic. There are several plot twists which are revealed through subtle hints which swell into bursts of surprise. I will be reading other books by this extremely talented writer."
4,This story had me hooked from Page 1,"Unique plot, beautiful prose and characters who live and breathe."
3,Melodrama and poignant anti-hero,"Considering I disliked the narrator, I found myself riveted by the story. Greer has a talent for creating intricate character interaction, though his use of language tends to fall into melodrama at times. And while I did not like Max Tivoli, I felt the sympathy for his plight needed to continue on with the story.Overall, I'd say a good book for someone who is looking for an unusual story of obsessive love and loss."
1,Very Overated,"I was tempted to stop reading after the first 50 pages, but I kept thinking something interesting would happen. Nothing does. If you find yourself in the same situation, save yourself some time and stop. Better yet, don't even start. As another reveiewer said, there are much better books out there."
2,WHAT A WASTE OF A GREAT IDEA,"I want to start by saying that I still feel I am missing something with this book. Maybe it's my fault that I absolutely felt nothing for these characters. The writers style is sooo tedious. It's all flowery description, that is wonderful at first, but after a while you want some kind of forward progression in the story. Even two-thirds into the story, I was still waiting for some reason to pick this book up again and keep reading. I don't have a lot of time to read so I really pick my books carefully and, except for a few choice sentences, I just regret the time I spent on this souless story that seemed to have so much promise. What a waste of a great story idea."
1,Who cares?,"I must agree with Charles Weinstein, who posted his review on March 22, 2004. Rather than paraphrase what he so eloquently and perceptively found lacking in Greer's book, I would simply direct those who might be swayed by the gushing, glowing reviews to read his before buying this disappointing work. Such a promising premise - and yet the characters left me caring not a whit for them, or what ultimately became of them. Having just finished The Time Traveler's Wife and You Remind Me of Me, this book seemed liked an apt continuation of the theme - time and place disjointed, the placement of characters we care about in impossible situations. I gave up after 175 pages, read the last page, and moved on to the next book on my shelf - Peace Like a River. Higher hopes abound."
3,Max is Kind of Freaky!!!,"This book had a very original idea, BUT fell short of reaching any expectations I had. I found it very predictable from the start. Mostly it was difficult to believe that Max went unrecognized by so many people he encountered a second time in his life. Max came off as a Psychotic stalker to me. At one point I wished Alice never crossed his path for a second time. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a book about true love."
2,You're Not the Only One,"To the reviewer who asked if they were the only one: the answer is no, you're not!I had--if not high--at least moderate expectations for this book. I love speculative fiction and enjoy slow-paced, rich novels. But ""plodding"" is indeed the correct term for this plot.I felt oddly disconnected from all of the characters and had no sympathy for anyone. Often, the prose was very self-aware. This is a book looking for a great editor.Such an interesting premise that never came to fruition!"
2,flowery language and eratic time changing but interesting,"I picked this novel for our book club and 100% of the participants had difficulty getting through the book. The language is very flowery and overly descriptive and some people complained because they couldn't figure out how old Max was at some points in the book. It was an interesting concept and we did have a good discussion however. I have to admit, I have thought about the book since so it can't be that bad."
1,Ssssssnore!,"I'm having such a hard time staying awake, and caring about Max. If there's a story to tell - - tell it! Stop skipping and hopping around from the present to the future and back again. And what does everyone find so enthralling about how this book is written? Get this: ""But I could not be stopped. She swam like a mermaid in the swamp-tank of my dreams."" - - What??? Greer's photo on the flap is one of a handsome, young man. I would have sworn this book was written by a crotchety forever-old man (maybe like Max). I am SO TIRED of wasting Good money on Bad books!"
1,Just Curious?,"I have not read this book, however I did read the novella by F. Scott Fitzgerald, ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", and I'm wondering.....is it just me or does this book have the exact same plot?"
3,Cool borrowed premise; Excellent execution,"A fascinating read about a man who ages backwards, starting off with the body of an old man and mind of an infant and ending up in the reverse situation. Despite this science fiction type scenario, Confessions basically belongs in the category of absorbing literature anchored by an ill fated love affair. Most of us have less dramatic reasons for things working out with the great loves of our lives than Max Tivoli, yet ultimately our reasons are all one and the same. The timing was not quite right. This was a very enjoyable read. My ranking is 3-1/2. I was absorbed right from the start and totally connected with the doomed narrator, hoping against hope that his plight would lead to a happy ending, knowing that even when this is an impossibility it doesn't mean that one's dreams can't be fulfilled (if only temporarily) along the way. After all, life isn't all about the inescapable end, it's about the ""along the way""."
3,Poor Max!?,"The Confessions of Max Tivoli is certainly an interesting story to say the least. I think that Mr. Greer was quite imaginative in his approach to this story. Max definately encounters some strange situations with his physical life moving in the opposite direction. It left me wondering if there were any true advantages for Max living this way. Rather, Max seemed frustrated most of the time because he was trapped in his freak body, even when others did not even believe him, especially following WWI. All in all, it was a good read! There were times that I felt lost when the author would move from decade to decade, but once I caught on, it worked to keep the reader engaged. I also understand that there is a major motion picture scheduled for the end of 2008 that is based on this novel...that should be interesting! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes out of the ordinary story lines."
4,helpful,The book simplifies tax concepts and condenses them so that the students has a better understanding of the subject.
4,tease tease tease,"The ""Soprano on Her Head"" is just the thing to help gain perspective on what it means to be a functional and social musician. Very nicely written; it's like a literary box of chocolates: take one topic at a time, or devour the whole book in one go!"
5,Useful for any creative medium,"I skimmed through this book and thought, ""well, this isn't really much."" Then I started reading it again and found many helpful things. I especially liked the chapter ""Drink your milk; don't drink your milk"" - on how to ignore the endless amount of expert advice and technical guidance available, most of it contradictory. As a visual artist, I found myself feeling much lighter and happier about my work process since reading this book."
4,A Comfort To Me,"I was introduced to this CD following the death of my infant granddaughter last summer. We used ""A Visitor From Heaven"" during her memorial service and it was a comforting conclusion to a beautiful service. For several weeks ""Visitor"" was the only selection I listened to, then I listened to the rest of the CD and found other wonderful songs of praise and comfort. I listen daily to all or some of the CD and continue to be comforted by Twila's beautiful songs."
2,"Not her best, but fans will like it.","I've listened to this album many times. I've tried to give it a chance. I just don't see this as her best work. After a while all of the songs begin to sound the same.The most moving song on the album is ""Visitor from Heaven"" about Wendy Hope, a baby girl who lived just a short time in the fall of 1991.Many of the songs seem too contrived, or unnatural. It's as if Paris is trying too hard.I mean Twila no disrespect. I like her music. While I do not hesitate to recommend her other work, I'm unable to speak as highly of this recording."
4,One Piece Character Song Carnival,"This a great collection of songs, sung by the characters. A must have for any One Piece fan."
2,Not very useful,"If you're interested in tips on how to approach buyers and sell photographs, then this book will have some interesting insights for you. However, if you're simply interested in taking better pictures then you will find very little of interest. The book is sparsely illustrated (no color photographs at all and very few b&w), and there is very little useful technical information.Certainly Ms. McCartney has had many varied experiences, but there is not enough material here to create an interesting book; she discusses the many places that she has visited (an impressive list), but fails to discuss any particular area in any meaningful depth.If you want advice on selling stock photos to XYZ company then this might be the book for you. If you want to improve your photography skills or are looking for artistic inspiration/guidance then you'll be disappointed. Much more highly recommended in National Geographic Photography Field Guide, which contains everything that this book lacks."
2,very few advices...,"This book was a disappointment... Yes of course McCartney is talking about travel photography and gives a few -good- advices but the book is a real pain to read. She keeps talking about herself and how great she is and how many countries she traveled and another couples of very useless stories. Also some points are very discutable.... p23 ""You don't have to be handsome or beautiful to be a successful photographer, but you should strive to be as physically attractive and well-groomed as you can be.""To conclude, there are very few photographies, B/W, outdated and some of them not very interesting at all."
1,DREADFUL,"How could anyone write a ""I Hate"" book; what kind of human beings are we?I have not read this book , but I skimmed through it at a bookstore to see the contents. It's just pure garbage and belongs in the trashcan. If you don't like someone, keep quiet about it and don't try to exploit them and make money off their personal lives.BUYERS BEWARE: SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,This selection is not worthy,"Why would anyone want to waste their time on this book? First of all, if you don't like Kathie Lee, then why bother. Second, just because Kathie Lee has a successful career and a good life does not mean that everyone should be trying to pull her down. This writer needs to find something else to write about!"
5,A TRF CLASSIC!,"For TRF, 1995 would continue to be a gold year.At the same time people would want to jam with their synth pop music, the group wanted to try something different with Komuro Tetsuya leading the charge.The group would dwelve into an experimental stage with their music and for the hit ""Overnight Sensation"", the group would start to incorporate more of a live house feel with a funky feel and continue with each member having their vocal involvement.The song would be used for a ""HONDA Live Dio"" CM song and would debut at #1 on the Oricon Charts.The CD single would sell 1.19 million copies and would open up another exciting album ""dAnce to positive"" (their 4th album) which would also debut at #1 on March 27th.From this point on with TRF's music, the group would begin to incorporate the live house band to their live concert performances and later CD singles.The music video for ""Overnight Sensation"" was shot in Australia."
1,Packaging outdated,"This product and others are older editions of the TimeWise Miracle Set. I had a set that got old once and the cleanser became rancid with a not so pleasant odor. I'm concerned that these containers were replaced far long ago. If outdated and someone has reaction, could be bad for the seller. I'd take it off and what you sell needs to be in the containers shown. thanks."
3,Timewise Miracle Set,"I have very oily skin, so am always on the hunt for a gentle cleanser that won't irritate it, and a moisturizer that won't add to it. This set was okay, but not really worth the cost."
1,Slush from the Sixties,"This tome falls into the tedious genre of balding-Catholic-hippie literature. Short on insight and long on self-admiration, ""A View from the Monastery"" turns out to be no more than a look in the mirror for its author. If you enjoy reading books which celebrate the destruction of monastic culture and present tendentious arguments in favor of the shallow pseudoliberation of the 1960s, this is the book for you. (P.S. I didn't much like it.)"
3,A politically-correct monk?,"This book is beautifully written and most definetly worth the money! However, I was surprised by this monk's very liberal application of the scriptures to controversial issues. I think St. Benedict himself would roll over in his grave if he knew how the monks of his order live nowadays. I'm not sure I understand Brother Benet's message but I was surprised at some of his beliefs. This book is still a nice little read and definetly an interesting peek into the lives of modern-day monks."
2,A View INTO the Monastery,"Br Benet provides not so much a view of the world FROM the monastery as one of the monastery itself from within. Smoothly written, this book is a kind of memoir which may serve as a rudimentary introduction to much of contemporary Catholic monasticism. (Not every community, naturally, is mirrored in Tvedten's book - this much he says, and should be expected.) Nonetheless, ""View"" must be read critically, as it is very much the particular view of one man.One serious shortcoming, from the Catholic doctrinal standpoint, is Br Benet's treatment of homosexuality. Lacking some important nuances, a reader might be misled about the Church's teaching on human sexuality."
2,Sometimes interesting but light reading.,"The book has some funny stories in it. It flows pretty good and is not hard to read. But it has some of the same problems as Kathleen Norris's books. Too much on how monks are ""just like everybody else"". Why are they monks then? Also some bad language that seems to just be there for shock value, like in a movie for teenagers."
5,A Great View of Monasticism,"Brother Tvedten is a subtle teacher of monasticism. Through very short, poignant stories, I learned volumes about a subject of which I had very little knowledge. This is one of the best books I have read this year, and I heartily recommend it."
1,waste of $50,"I made the mistake of giving weight to the other reviews. What a load of blathering nonsense! Full of ego, costumes and cutting your self with a razor if you make a mistake (come on?)I had my doubts about Crowley, now I know. It is hard to believe someone can use so many words and say absolutely nothing that pertains to the purported subject. ""The true and invisible Rosicrucian order"" -Paul Foster Case contained much more true meaning!"
5,Best Book I've Ever Read,"I am a huge astronomy nerd and I must say that cannot learn well by reading. I have a hard time choosing books which explain things the way I can understand them. That doesnt mean I need things simplified for me, I can understand complicated things much better. Anyway, this book covers topics in the area of stellar birth and death, and black holes. It is an absolute MUST HAVE for a hard core astronomy person such as myself. If only it was written sooner... Im sure there have been changes since 1979... oh well. The book is packed full of knowledge and the author tells the process of starbirth not too slowly or quickly, but just right. Definately the most informative and EASY TO READ astronomy book Ive ever read, hands down."
3,Cute,This item is adorable. However shortly after about 4 wears the bottom of the dress started to unravel. It is better than many costumes but the quality is not as strong as expected
5,"Adorable , Well made Halloween Costume","This item was the cutest costume my daughter has ever had, she received lots of compliments and it is made so well you could use it again and again."
1,"I agree, it's a Chicken Soup for the Buddist Soul, but bad","This book is worse than the first one. The first Art of Happiness wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either. This one takes the concept - trying to use the Dalai Lama's teachings to create some kind of self-help system - one step too far into hokiness. It's drivel, really. If you're interested in the teachings of HH the DL, then read the books actually written by him. Or just go read some Buddhist texts. This book is a waste of time."
4,Incompatible ways of life,"I would give 5 stars if only the thoughts of Dalai Lama had been presented in the book. However, as we have to read the fool comments and rationalizations of the ''other guy'', I give a 4 stars. The intelligent reader should note the incompatibility between Dalai Lama's thoughts and the ''american way of life'' and capitalist society. The funny thing is that the american guy does not realize this incompatibility and he is unable to question if the american socio-economic environment is adequate to the grow of health human beings. He is all the time worried about ''practical'' advices, a typical characteristic of the conformist american society.The messages of Dalai Lama are in more agreement with the democratic socialism, expressed for example in ''The Acquisitive Society'' by Tawney or in ''The Sane Society'' by Fromm. By the way, it would be a bless if we could read Dalai Lama interviewed by someone of the stature of Erich Fromm."
1,"name dropping, dishonest egoist","Cutler is nothing more than a name-dropper, hanging on the coat-tails of the Dalai Lama. The book is about Cutler, it's not about you, and hardly about ethics or the Dalai Lama. Boycott Cutler; don't buy this book."
5,The Man is Right - Just Deal With It,"If you looking for a magic answer - you are not going to find it here. It's hard to expect it from a man who never worked for a large corporation in the trenches. He can't imagine the level of petiness that the corporate world brings people down to. Nevertheless, The Dalai Lama nailed it. I can summarize his message in this statement. Here goes: ""Who said life is fair? Life is tough, deal with it."" The man is right..."
3,Art of happiness,"OK, but just OK. Slow, tedious to read, but good input into how to be satisfied at work."
3,ok to read a library copy,"Not as rich as the original ""Art of Happiness"" book.The take away piece for me is Dalai's answer to ""when was your happiest moment"".""... perhaps it was when I passed my Geshe exams.""And the author didn't get it, comparing to passing a final exam of a PhD in Buddhist philosophy.Dalai was chosen as a young boy to be Lama, not studying the Geshe degree under his free will. The 17-years journey then passing this test and emerging as an adult spiritual leader is almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy, while the rest just took care of itself. That's what he remembered as the first highlight of his life. The ""first"" of anything gives us the most mental/emotional/spiritual impact."
3,A Cutler Product,"It's a Cutler product. I think the intention is good but books more from the Dali Lama are probably what you are after. I like the book....but....agree with the 1 ratings as I do the 5 ratings. It feels too much like a Cutler product.It reads ok - but there is a feeling that it is not the Dali Lamas book at all, but a favor to a friend."
1,"The ""chicken soup"" reviewers are correct","The first review I read the reviewer had said everything about this book in one sentence ""A shameful exploitation of an important religious figure."" Dr. Howard C. Cutler is perhaps a very intelligent individual with real purpose and sincerity with his thoughts and ambitions but I feel as though these thoughts and ambitious do not belong in a book such as this."
2,By the Dalai Lama?,"I saw this book on the discount shelf at my local bookstore, and I thought...hey why not, I enjoy literature on the Dalai Lama so I picked it up. After a chapter or two I realized this really has nothing to do with his holiness, it is just Cutler's babbling on about his thoughts and entering the Dalai Lama here and there. At first I became more and more fed up with this book, but then I took a break and realized that the Dalai Lama's words, the few of them, were very powerful and uplifting.I gave the book two stars because it is obvious that Cutler just used the Dalai Lama as a marketing tool, which worked in my case, to sell this book on HIS thoughts and not the Dalai Lama's.If you are interested in this type of material I say get the book...it is a good read, but beware that you will be reading about Cutler's experiences more than the Dalai Lama's."
1,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this book, but it turned out to be terribly disappointing. Throughout the text, Cutler keeps asking questions that the Dalai Lama is obviously not particularly interested in addressing. He is polite enough to come up with some answers, but it's clear that he finds most of the questions either irrelevant or too general. Most of the content turns out to be a tired repetition of the most obvious cliches (""don't let $ determine your worth"", etc.) Cutler and the Dalai Lama seem to be on completely different wavelengths and their interaction comes across (at least on the page) as forced and not particularly stimulating. Even the attempts at humor fall painfully short. I was very much anticipating the Dalai Lama's insights on happiness in the face of challenging circumstances, but what I got instead is Cutler's confused prose and little else."
3,"Wellements Bora Bora Organic Snack Bar, Almond Sunflower",When I first tried this snack bar I really loved it. I went and bought two boxes. Now I find that it is a little too sweet for me. I'm sure it's healthy but I'd rather have chocolate.
2,Stops working after sometime,I got this replacement battery and it worked for hardly an year and now it's gone bad. I need to get another one now. I don't know if the problem is in the part or the laptop but seems like I got a bad deal
1,This battery looks like the right battery but the computer resets randomly,"Other reviews have state the same. This battery looks write with the label and everything, but it doesn't work. The computer resets randomly and is therefor unusable."
1,This battery will *not* fit a T-61,"The product description says it fits T-61s. Nope. Just got it, going right back. It's genuine Lenovo, plastic is good, inspection marksetc. are good. It just doesn't fit my T-61. :("
3,Great company support,I received the part I ordered and it wouldn't hold a charge so the company replaced it with a 9-cell battery that works great. Great customer service.
1,Horrible quality,"Historically, I always recommended IBM/Lenovo laptops because the battery quality was ALWAYS superior to their competitors.In June of '08, I purchased a T60 with this battery for my niece to take to college. Now in July of '09, this battery won't hold a charge for longer than 40 minutes or so. When contacting Lenovo customer service, they wouldn't help. Buy a new battery was their only option and they weren't willing to offer any concessions or discounts... full price or nothing. Regretfully, it looks like I will have to purchase a replacement battery every summer for the next several years since my niece still has to go to college and needs a laptop with a good battery.So much for the historical value of the Lenovo brand! What a shame Lenovo... you've ruined your reputation in my book and I won't be recommending your laptops any further. If I had the opportunity, I would return the system for a refund and get her a new laptop with a battery that will last for more than a year."
1,Battery stores only 49% of fully charge after 1 year 1 month purchased,"That's suck. Exactly 1 year and 20 days after the warranty date is expired, my battery said it's in poor condition can ""only store 49% of its original full charge capacity......""Please stay away from Lenovo, customer services didn't helpful."
1,Misrepresented,"This ""Thinkpad T60 Series 6-Cell Battery"" is not ""by Lenovo"" as represented. It is not fully compatable with this laptop and raises some concern on my part."
2,Not Genuine,"The battery works fine however, everyday I get a message that lets me know this is not a genuine Lenovo battery. When I purchased this product I thought it was a genuine Lenovo product. If the battery that I already had wasn't totally dead I would have tried to return it."
1,T60 Battery,"I bought the T60 battery that was supposed to be a new Lenovo Battery. It was 75% full (must have been used and returned by somebody else) and it lasted only 2 hours. My original T60 battery that I got from Lenovo lasted 3 hours. I can only assume I was sold either a used or refurbished battery. I wasn't able to contact MCL because they have no customer service (Amazon doesn't have this either). I wouldn't recommend buying from MCL. If you have a problem, there is nobody to speak with."
2,Doesn't last like the origional,"As the title states, it does not last like the battery the laptop came with. Not sure why that is, maybe they are selling used batteries as new?"
3,GPS Auto Tracker,"The mini tracker is simple to use and does what it suppose to do. Main complaint is that the battery life is very short. Because of that you have to remove 4 timy screws to take the battery cover off. If this cover was the slide and remove type it would be so convenient and not a hassle. But because you have to change the batteries constantly, it is becoming very inconvenient."
1,Only one!,"I'm bummed. Was all set to prime my new canvases.As others have stated, received only one while it should have been a 'pack of 48'.Not sure where the problem lies. Mine came from AG Distributors.There is some value in knowing the product and understanding what you are putting in the box. Seems to be lost here.On the other hand, Amazon customer service continues to be the best."
1,Only 1 brush,"I also ordered this item and received 1 brush instead of the ""Pack of 48"" described. I contacted Amazon and they are crediting my account (I hope)."
5,worked great,I used these brushes over and over. Worked great for my craft using paint and mod podge. Towards the end some of them got a little flaky but I think it's because I used them so much
3,Image downloading software,"I bought this camcoder 3 years back and havent used much. Recently after using i tried to download the imaged to my laptop and realized i misplaced the CD. I tried to download the software from their site. Panasonic directed me to the [...] site. Their i didnt find the downloadable and I called their customer support. The asked me to call panasonic at 800-211 7262. I called and the customer support after asking all the details told me that the softare is not downloadable and if i want to get anoter CD i have to pay $ 9 +...i am shoked, seems panasonic is trying to make continues revenue generation techniques.pla keep this in mind when you try to buy panasonic products"
4,Great Buy!,"This camera is a great value. The only drawback is filming in low light situations. Great Image Stabilizer, Powerful optical zoom, compact, and very easy to use. Overall a Great Buy!"
1,Do NOT buy Panasonic!,"This was the 3rd Panasonic product I have purchased that has completely quit within a year of purchase. After video recording a trip, it died. Completely. If you own this, put in a memory card right now, because it will DIE! It was a huge waste of money. Just buy an iPhone and use the camcorder on that...it'll last longer and it's way more reliable."
4,Great Camera...So Far,"I did a ton of research before purchasing this camera. For the price, the Panasonic seemed like the best choice. I've owned it for a little over a week, and so far I'm very happy with it. The zoom is great...I was able to zoom in on surfers clearly nearly 400 yards away. The software that it comes with seems crappy, but I completely bypass it using Windows Vista. I just plug it into the USB 2.0 port and the files end up on the hard drive. I then use Windows Movie Maker which is incredibly easy to learn and mess around with."
4,"great video camera, missing some options","great video cam, missing a flash light, a touch screen, and a lens shutter that is part of the camera. but the best for money value. I was so unhappy though as i purchased the camera and 5 days later i found it 50$ cheaper in circuit city. I will look more carefully next time."
4,Great so far!,"So far, so good! Easy to use. Lightweight yet feels sturdy. I got a hard disk camcorder so that I wouldn't have to deal with tapes, disks, or anything else that might be obsolete in a few years. I wanted to be able to just put it right on my computer and then burn it to DVD or post it online or whatever.I have a Mac and it won't work with IMovie, but the software that comes with it seems okay.The only thing that is a little annoying is that the lens cap comes completely off and hangs on a string, so it kind of dangles around while you're filming. I usually tuck it in between my hand and the camera. I would prefer the kind where it's built in and you just open and close it like a shutter.Overall, for the price, I think this is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality, affordable digital camcorder. Oh, and it was Consumer Reports' top pick for this type of camcorder!"
2,Not what I expected,I bought this original Pawley's island hammock. Didn't find out untill I opened the box that it was made in China. Now that may not matter to some. but I expected an original Pawley's island hammock to be made in the USA. It looks like it was made by children.
3,It was sappy.,"Okay, easy reading. First book was good but got sappy with the second. Doubt I'll be reading more of these."
2,Good Quality....BAD design,"This basket is large and made of good materials. However, the openings in the wire mesh are simply too large for most vegetable pieces. What is worse is that all the way around the basket, where the side meets the bottom, are very large openings that allow thick potato or pepper slices to fall out when you flip the basket over. Plan on cutting very large pieces if you want to grill vegetables with this basket (maybe 4 pieces from an average Bell pepper for example)."
3,Fish only.,"That's what I use it for, just fish. Two problems with it. Given the locking mechanism you just cannot use it for very think fish. Even a decent thickness of Salmon is difficult to cook. Next time I will get one with way more thickness and then maybe I could lock the handles together and they actually stay together when I want to turn the fish over. This one just falls apart. That's the second problem, it does not lock together well at all."
5,"Nice, big basket","I really like this grill basket. It has enough room to cook three salmon steaks and even has room to spare to cook asparagus while we are cooking the fish. There were no blemishes or chips in the wood, and everything was delivered in great shape. I also didn't have the problem cleaning the basket that some other reviewers had. I spray Pam on it before I use it, and clean up is a cinch."
3,Grilling basket I use for fish,"Practical basket for grilling. You can put in a whole salmon to grill if you cut in half. Only problem is that grlll won't seal close and some outside air keeps ashes very hot so your fish gets cooked faster. I use it with mesquite and if I could cook it longer and close that lid, the smokey flavor would blend in nicer. Overall, it is practical. Your fish will not come apart if you flip it over, but got to watch your cooking time."
5,This one started it all...,"To start out any ""Homecoming"" collection, this one is a must have. It was recorded in 1991 as a new album for the Gaither Vocal Band. Bill wanted to have some of his heroes come and record with them on the old gospel song ""Where Would I Go?"" A first of its kind video was also made. Since then, dozens of CDs and videos and sold out concert tours have followed. I recommened this and any of the Bill Gaither ""Homecoming"" titles for southern gospel fans everywhere."
2,ZULIEKA DOBSON,"ALTHOUGH BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN, ZULIEKA DOBSON IS ESSENTIALLY THE WHOLE PLOT CENTERS ARROUND ONE JOKE.IT SEEMS THAT ALL THE UNDERGRADUATES OF OXFORD HAVE FALLEN MADLY IN LOVE WITH THE WARDEN'S (DEAN'S)GRANDDAUGHTER. SINCE ZULIEKA REBUFFS THEIR LOVE THEY DECIDE TO COMMITTT MASS SUICIDE; WHICH THEY DO.THE WHOLE PREMISE IS ZULIEKA AND THE DUKE ONE UPPING EACH OTHER ON TRYING TO PRETEND THAT THEY ARE NOT IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER."
2,"TOP GIRL, BOTTOM DRAWER","Another over-hyped release from MYA Studios - the story about a girl who wins a contest and goes to the big city in hopes of becoming a tv star, only to find out otherwise. Truly inspiring plotline,ay? Well, it only gets worse from there. The lead actress is not as attractive as the cover would have you believe, the story about the 'behind the scenes' in TV makes a daytime soap opera seem complex and, frankly, there`s just not enough nudity to make you forget how bad this is, even in the pantheon of bad Joe D`Amato films. Why it`s generally listed in the Horror / Exploitation catagory is beyond me - I think they think folks who like these genre`s will (and often do) buy anything. After all, they got my money, didn`t they? Take my advice, and wait for 'Island of the Fishmen' to come out, it`s gonna be bad but, hopefully, in a good way."
2,Blah,"It's just not as fun as it could be. The phrases are cute enough, most easy to recognize. They just don't have a lot of mix and match potential."
4,Not quite what I expected.,"The retail packaging on the one I received was worn and made this look really old or like it had been on a shelf for ages, but the inside magnets were fine. We've had fun with it, but it has limited ways to create lines. My mom has one of these that are just words and we would sit in the kitchen creating stories forever. This one makes for some funny sayings, but since it is broken in phrases, makes putting things together hard. I think if I supplement it with a regular word one, then we might be able to use it more. Not bad, just not what I expected."
4,good mix of movies,if you enjoy quotes from movies you'll have fun with this. I also bought the Geek set to mix and match them and found that to be very fun.
3,Wrong Scale,"This item was received as O scale yet was listed on Amazon under HO scale. Very misleading and I opened the packaging before I noticed. However, I am getting refunded without out the need to return the item. That is great service."
4,State Secrects,All of Linda Lael Millers' books are good. She really gets the characters to come alive.
2,Not her best,"I got this as a library ebook...and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. This is an updated re-release written in 1985. Maybe the characters are indicative of the times when written, but they are nowhere near the caliber of her more recent works. I usually love her books and was glad to see this available through my library. The only reason I finished it was because I hate to start reading a book and not finishing it...but this is definitely several hours of my life I won't get back. I would not recommend this to anyone...try one of her other books intead."
4,Federico Aubele - Gran Hotel Buenos Aires,"The question to ask with Federico Abuele's debut album, Granhotelbuenosaires, is how much is Federico and how much is the Thievery Corporation. No doubt about it, the Thievery Corporation stamp is there: sloping dub rhythms, sleepy mellowness. But the tracks themselves have an unmistakable Latin flair; that could only be Aubele's doing. Far from simply adding some Spanish vocals, Aubele's compositions seem to reach back to his Argentine roots. There are some lovely songs here, such as ""Esta Noche"" and ""Salvacion,"" which are all delicacy and grace. ""Contigo"" adds some horns to the prevalent Spanish guitars to tremendous effect. ""Besos De Sal"" brings some sunshine to lighten up the end of the album. An impressive debut."
1,Boring mish-mash of pseudo-Latin pop sound,"Aubele's album is a boring mish-mash of pseudo-Latin pop sound. Only a couple of songs have merit; the rest are nice, well-orchestrated, but hum-drum. OK music to listen to while you work on your computer; nothing else."
1,GOOD CD BUT OVER PRODUCED,"The Thievery Corp guys try to steal the album from Federico Aubele whom when left alone to play the guitar is spectacular.All he songs start off the same and it becomes boring after the second cut, too much going on most of the songs, I bought this cd after listening to Los Amigos Invisibles produced by M.A.W. and was really looking forward to a Thievery produced cd.I BEEN ROBBED."
3,"BsAs yes, tango no","Because the sleeve says 'Buenos Aires' most people expect something like Gotan Project, Narcotango, Tanghetto. Modern music with strong tango influences. Even my local cd-shop filed it under 'tango'. But non of that on this CD. It's great music, well produced, but most traditional influences are the wellknown monotonous latin, salsa, rhumba, brazil kind."
3,OK CD.,"It has one tango song on it that I really like, aside from that none of the rest really grab me."
4,Great album from ESL,"Thievery corp have chosen another winner!Federico's album is lush - full of downtempo, dubby sounds with a latin flair. Love the guitar work on all the tracks!"
3,Nice but a little bland.,"This album is beautifully executed but it's still a little too bland for my taste. I guess I was expecting something more along the lines of Miguel Migs. I know, bad comparisson... but still. I would recommend this album to those of you who are really into ""chill out"" style music and are looking for something with some Latin flavor. It sets a very seductive mood."
2,Ticks keep on ticking,"After a lot of research, I discovered the Adams collars for our three cats. They seemed to have the right ingredients that were both safe for our pets and effective against their would-be passengers. I will say that we have noticed zero fleas. But now in May, we've been pulling lots of ticks off of one of our cats. I just now pulled up the product listing on amazon to see whether perhaps it was claimed only as a flea collar, but it does say ""flea & tick"". It seems ineffective against ticks. Some of the ticks have even been attached in areas close to the collar, like ears and shoulders."
4,Una pelicula muy atrapante.,"La trama de este film atrapa y entretiene al punto de tener al espectador siempre preguntandose que va a pasar despues.... La actuacion de Pablo Echarri es destacable y por supuesto, como siempre, el espectacular trabajo a que nos tiene acostumbrados Hector Alterio. Es un drama que muestra una utopia siempre presente en el imaginario social de la Argentina... y en la frase ""los derechos no se negocian"" se encuentra la justificacion a todos los actos del protagonista.Una pelicula recomendable."
3,"Looks cool, but has annoying flaws","I haven't tried any other tables of this sort, but this one looked cool, and I bought it through Staples.com. The table is not comfortable to use in bed since it doesn't come lower than 30 inches, which is even higher than my regular desk! There is limited space for using a mouse or Wacom tablet, if you have one; you'll have to make personal adjustments. All my wires and cables are always getting caught in the wheels and legs of the table when I move it - it's very annoying! It needs a redesign of the legs and wheels and some clamp to hold the cables.The table is a little wobbly, but seems to support both my hands when I lean on it for typing. The wide panels of the safety edge seem needlessly wide. Some extra space would have brought your laptop closer to you."
3,unbiased real opinion,"the thing is flimsy (about as minimalist as can be & still work) but works pretty good, I use it in bed with my laptop....relieves problem of hot (& heavy) laptop sitting on you. others are priced at least $20-30 more. Has the pin lock for height adjusting which I like versus the screw knob adjustment( metal against metal makes for metal filings)7 height adjustments every 2 inchesI'm into design & like the form"
5,Great Product,This cup is alot more sturdy then it looks.Great price especially for the quality of the product.I ended up ordering another one for my Dad.
4,South of Eden is Compelling,"I found Murray's latest work to be compelling. A bit confusing though. I seemed to loose Vivian Cross in the presence of her own fear. Or was it something real? The facts surrounding the time and location were thought provoking, and left me wondering what else might have been drawn into the area to develop it's sense of respect among it's citizens. Many bad people were in charge, and only through participation in like evil did there seem to be a way to rise above it. Couldn't set it down for long though."
5,Superstructs Castle Set makes the perfect gift,"With 10 Grandkids between the ages of 3 to 15, it's sometimes hard to come up with ""good"" gift ideas. I gave Superstructs to a 5 year old Grandson, and not only did he love it, so did his 4 brothers and sisters. It's a great way to use ones imagination, and spans a large age group.Grandma cvs"
3,Size?!?!,"I have no complaints about quality of the product. It came on time and is made of sturdy material. No complaints there. The problem I have is with description and sizing. ""Small"", ""Medium"", and ""Large"" don't tell me much in terms of length and width of the cockpit it can cover. I bought medium and it turn out to be too small to fit my kayak. Another few inches and it would've fit. What a bummer, I didn't even bother to return it. It would've been nice if Amazon could provide info which of its products fit their other products. :) That's the only reason I'm taking off 2 stars."
2,"Fine for rough work, that's all","These were okay for rough stuff, but they didn't hold up well over time. We ended up buying top shelf brushes ($15-20 per) at our local hardware store for fine work or for highly visible areas. Those we still have. The Linzer's were tossed long ago. If quick n dirty is all you need, these will serve. You get what you pay for."
3,Good brushes for a fast job,"If you are looking to do a quick spruce up around the house, these brushes, and the price for them are great. They work well the first time through, and although they are washable, I found that by the second and third washing, you were better off paying the $ and buying a new set. The brushes are soft, but doing fine work or trying to do trim left brush marks for me."
1,This is not the collection you want...,Don't buy this collection. It's random and silly.Just go buy the Complete Season starting with the first one.
4,Cal History,"Talk about revival Cal Tjader did a vinyl disk many years earliertittled 'Shades of Jade"" way different content."
1,Check your Price,"SanDisk makes great products for the most part. The quality of the company offering this is challenged. I would say quality control on the advertising end needs work as I can't imagine one 2gig thumb drive as the ad lists or even a case of them is worth the asking price of ""$9,995.03 "" is justified"
4,I had an extra 10 Grand laying around..,I had an extra 10 grand burning a hole in my pocket and I needed a flash drive. Enough said. Great product. This thing is expensive but hey it's TITANIUM! Think of all the looks of envy at your next cocktail party when you pull this puppy out! 10 Grand USB Flash drive. Beat that Mr. I have a Porsche.
1,Pathetic Drivel,"I was hoping for some intelligent insight into Hillary Clinton when I bought this book. Clearly, much can be said on both sides of this subject. I am trying to listen carefully to both and then make up my mind about her.This is the equivalent to a rant from a right-wing Rosie O'Donnell. Don't waste your money on this rehash of old news."
1,Loathsome Right Wing Shill Hopes to Cash In!,"Tyrell is a famous phony on the Scaife payroll -- Scaife used Tyrell's right wing propaganda sheet, the Spectator, to fund dirty tricks against the democrats. All the sewage has been exposed by David Brock. The net result? Tyrell lost his magazine, what shreds remained of his credibility (which only existed among his coterie of right wing conspiracy nuts and spin doctors anyway -- nobody else took him seriously.) Now he's back with -- guess what? Another smear job on Hilary Clinton. Think he needs the money? Are you foolish enough to give it to him?"
1,Hillary-mania : A wonderful thing!,"Whatever Hillary Clinton says and does is perfectly alright with me! If Hillary says it, then it's the truth. Hillary is perfect in every way! I love Hillary so very much!"
5,Don't LIsten to Those One-Star Reviews,"They're posted by irrational, biased Clinton lovers. This author has not ""made a career"" of bashing the Clintons. I have read other books by him as well as articles from his magazine. They are thoroughly researched, the dozens and dozens of reliable sources are all cited, and only an IDIOT would contend it's fiction rather than fact. Mr. Tyrell does a public service in exposing the Clintons for the corrupt liars they are. Highly recommended."
1,Right Wing propaganda,Just more unproved speculations that are being passed off as facts..Can you imagine what could be said about George W. Bush if the moderate left stooped to the level of this crap.
1,From the Nuts who Brought you the Arkansas project!,"If you love obsessed, nutty, conspiracy-mongering, rightwing fruitcakes who have no lives...you'll love this book!Sure to be bought in bulk by conservative Political Action Committees, and front groups to beef up its ""sales"" figures!If you buy it now, you're crazy. Just wait a few weeks, and you can get it for a dollar from the ""Conservative book club.""My suggestion is that you spend your money on that Cialis or Levitra prescription you've been eyeballing for the past few months, instead.Oh wait. maybe this book serves the same purpose! My bad."
2,Bash-a-rama-fest,"i find it telling just how right- or left-minded (aka: black or white extremist thinking) reviewers show themselves to be: i.e., ratings of 1 or 5 only?? well, this 2 is crashing the party.anyway, whether you're a 1,2,3,4 or 5, sirs tyrrell and davis will NEVER EVER be a mr. franken in this genre."
2,A persistent fixation on the Clintons,"Yes: Tyrrell and the American Spectator rode the wave of anti-Clintonionism during the 90's. Unfortunately, the wave has broke, and this book only emphasizes the fact that the author has been unable to let go of the past and move forward to matters of more current importance.There is a tone of personal vendetta here that remains the undercurrent on a subject which has been rehashed ad-naseam. Sadly, it's a tiresome read about a tiresome subject that has been bludgeoned to an already bloody pulp."
5,Cry for the Desert,"This is such a wonderful album filled with beautiful songs. So Christ centered and real, Twila's writing is deep and beautiful."
5,THE smallest multivitamin,"I've looked for quite awhile to find a very small, easy-to-swallow multivitamin...and this is it! I can't find this particular One-A-Day in stores so I order it thru Amazon. It's great for teenagers or anyone who doesn't like to swallow big horse-pill vitamins."
5,Essentials,No false advertising here like with some other products. The pills are small and they are easy to swallow. Hooray! I finally found a multivitamin I can take.
3,Small Vitamins For The Pill Averse,My teen ager hates big horse pill vitamins. This has the bare minimum 100% RDA for the main vitamin groups. At least he is willing to take this one.
4,Yet Another Re-Write of SQL Books Online ?,"Definitely not another Books Online. I bought this book to better understand hardware requirements for VLDB systems (1+Terabytes)... the book explains in great depth all vital hardware components in a system (RAID levels, CPU, RAM)... not just what is best but why, and the dynamics of how each component functions. The Sizing and Capacity Planning section was also great, as it gave mathematical equations for calculating system statistics... equations I had not seen before. I did not find the performance monitoring section especially helpful - although the book did make good suggestions about charting db performance over time."
3,"Good tips, but errors...","I found this book to be an OK reference. However, the author has mistakes in the treatment of RAID levels for DASD. Nice high level view of queuing theory and the basics of using histograms for analysis."
5,EXCELLENT CD,"If you want to worship in the spirit, this CD will help bring you into the presence of the Lord. The words and music set the tone and invite the Holy Spirit. I only wish I could find these songs on a background tape or CD so I could use them to perform with at our church. I was only able to get ""The Joy of The Lord"" in an accompanyment CD. There wasn't one song I wouldn't like to have for use in performing myself. This is a CD you will play over and over again. I encourage you to listen for yourself.An Alaskan fan, Jillian"
5,Twila Paris is at her best in this project,Twila Paris is at her best in this project. Sanctuary is wonderful collection of music delivered as only Twila Paris can produce. Sanctuary is perfect for background music or incredible for serious reflection. I have never heard Twila any better then this.
2,They tortured their data to fit their pre-conceptions,"A friend loaned me this book; I'm glad I didn't buy it. It is full of errors and omissions. I can't spoil the determined reader, as I gave up after chapter two.The book starts out claiming that the Apostle John wrote the Gospel according to John, however most reputable Biblical scholars agree Apostle John did not write the Gospel according to John.Then, they claim that the US conquered Germany in WWII; guess they forgot about Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and even Italy (who changed sides from the Axis at the beginning of WWII to the Allies at the end). If they add in the additional countries their calculations, and thus their conclusions fall apart.If you must read this book, buy it used or borrow it."
1,worthless,"Any good Hebrew scholar worth any thing will tell you that this is a false premise and that the Bible code does not exist. In fact, there have jsut been released information on studies regarding this proposal and there is no good information that this book is based in anything except wishful thinking. Iliff School of Theology"
4,"Interesting, if maybe not foolproof","It is true that some of the connections made through numbers are iffy -- yet brainstorming really is the only way to come up with possible events which to connect to one another. Regardless of certain extrapolations, this work parallels some of what Nostradamus prophecied and reflects certain current events. The book contains other interesting information about other connected events, such as dead presidents, as well as being very thorough about the Bible's Revelations, which I had had no contact with before. Also, none of the other reviewers seem to realize that this book was originally written in French(which is the one I read), and that what they're reading is a translation...which may have an effect on the communication of the finer nuances present in some of the arguements and discussions. It's also a quick read-- I read it in 2 days! you should definitely go for the soft cover edition when it comes out :)"
2,not as large as the [picture displays,"basket had all the stuff but did not see the difference in sizes, and alot of stuffing vs products in the basket, i believe buying the stuff individually would of been more economical"
3,mr bar b q 06049x grill flip basket,"awkward to use, the latches that hold basket shut, are loose and fly open dropping food into fire. it is too big to easily fit on a regular grill"
4,Great Grilling Accessory,"My family loves for me to grill. I tend to like it less than they do as it typically means dealing with fussy grill stuff that doesn't work well. Which is why I appreciate this -- it's easy to use, very functional, easy to clean, and makes for a convenient way to grill veggies. I liked it so much that I bought a second one!Another reviewer mentioned the handle getting hot but I haven't had that happen with typical use on my gas grill, grilling at fairly high temp for an hour at a time."
4,I love grilled veggies!,Nice item. The only problem is that I can't close the lid in my Weber because the handle is fixed and sticks out over the side of the grill.
3,Better but not yet great!,"There is nothing like grilled vegetables, but hubby lost so many during cooking that we needed a better solution. Gotta keep the cook happy! Well, he is not so easily impressed.What do I like? The larger basket with easy locking holds plenty, and is easy to flip and turn the vegetables (if they are not cut too small to fall through).What I don't like? The handle. We often put the cover of the grill down when cooking, and the handle would be much better if it were removable. A removable handle would make it fit better in the dishwasher as well.Maybe my handyman hubby can saw off the handle, and rig up a solution to turn it easily."
5,Great product at a great price,"I bought this grill basket as a gift for my dad in addition to a BBQ cookbook. He really liked it and the basket seems to be of good quality, especially for the low price. I was pleased with the purchase and recieved it quickly and professionally packaged."
2,Some Issues with it,"The description says it's non-stick. Well I must be doing something wrong then because it was stained the first time I used it. It is too big to soak in my sink and there's no way you can scrub in all the little grooves. Also the little ring that is supposed to keep the lid on is total garbage. It slips off constantly so flipping is out of the question unless you are extremely careful and pay attention to that ring. Furthermore the handle is very long and I have found no way to close my grill's lid using this thing, mind you, I have a four burner gas grill. For me, this is totally not worth the 16 some dollars I paid for it."
1,did not get it,"Well i don't really know how good the book is becouse it is now August 31, 2006 and i still have not recieved it.that is my review.Thank you,Joanna morales"
3,Beader's Companion,"I was hoping it would have things not in my other books, it's handy to take along on trips, but not really that informative compared to what i already had."
5,This book is all you need to start beading.,This book is great for the beginner or advanced beader. The illustrations and instructions are easy to follow. Worth the price and more.
5,Excellent Reference Book,"After having taken a week long course in beading and then returning to the ""real world"" where I did not get to bead for a few weeks, I found that I could easily pick up this book for a quick review and follow the step by step instructions easily and with excellent results. I also own the same series for knitting and have referred to that for years when I needed a review. I believe that even a beginner with no previous experience would be able to follow the instructions with success. The book covers a good range of techniques with background info on the supplies as well. A definate for any beaders library."
2,"If you have an interest in anything other than seed beads, keep shopping","I gave this book 2 stars, because it's a good reference for seed bead techniques. If that's what you're looking for, and you are a beginning beader, you might find this book useful, although many of the same techniques can be found in the back of most beading magazines. I found the rest of the book to be extremely disappointing, offering little more than illustrations. I am new to this hobby, and there wasn't much there (other than the seed bead techniques) that I couldn't figure out by looking at the illustrations or going to my local bead store."
5,Why Cowboys Sleep with Their Boots On,"This is a cute and entertaining story of a cowboy on a cattle drive who works hard and sleeps hard. He isn't aroused as different critters steal different garments of his in the night. After having to work even harder to replace needed items, he figures out to sleep in them. The illustrations make you feel like you're in the story. My young son loves this book and loves to tell people about it."
2,Not what I expected,"With a Punny title like that, I expected a book with a little humor in it. I was wrong. This book is dark, depressing, and not very engaging. Robin Light is taking over her dead husband's pet store. He died, not from a nice heart attack, but from a cocaine overdose. That sort of sets the tone for the whole book. I know some people like their mysteries to explore the darker side of human nature, but I just want to be entertained. I finally gave up. I skipped ahead so I know whodunnit, but really, by then, I didn't care."
1,Wrong description,"They had the wrong description for this item. It said 18-count, but I received one bone, paid $17 in shipping and just got one bone. The GREAT thing about this experience was that Amazon's A-to-Z policy fixed it all and refunded me the full amount!I LOVE AMAZON!!!"
4,A good DVD for the price,"Teletubbies don't do much for me but I have 2 year old twin boys who like them and they really like this DVD. It doesn't hurt that both are into animals right now but there just seems to be a lot of content on this disc for the money.My only gripe is that they could have broken it into smaller chapters to make it easier to jump to favorite scenes, but that's a very minor irritant.The digital picture is great and the ability to use some of the DVD players features (like looping through a favorite segment) is very handy too. If you have a DVD player spend the extra few dollars and get the DVD version instead of the VHS. I think there's enough extra content to justify the relativelt small difference in price."
1,Thumbs way down!,"...My 2-year-old loves animals and music, and this piece of work can't hold her still for 5 minutes. I swear I had MUCH more fun watching 'Babe' for the 37th time than ANY 5 minutes in this DVD.Bottom line, if your kid loves Cedarmont Kids, Babe, Homeward Bound, Toy Story 1/2, Monsters Inc. etc....STAY AWAY FROM THIS DVD, unless you need help falling asleep."
5,Teletubbies vs the babysitter,"I dont recommend allowing too much TV time for the kids but if you need a kitchen moment...throw in this movies and watch your little one become entranced with the playfull show, while you go about your bizz for a few!!!"
5,Tele 3,This product was for my grandchild age 5 mos. she enjoys it very much. We purchased more Telebubbies products too
3,Too Loooooong for Mommy,"I can't deny that my 2-year-old daughter loved this DVD at first, although her interest in the Tubbies is thankfully waning.That aside, my biggest gripe is that the video is 70+ minutes long with no interruptions. Most children's tapes/DVDs are divided into segments - i.e. the Bear in the Big Blue House DVDs contain three episodes. That way, it can be turned off after 25 minutes if necessary (b/c you have somewhere to go, your kid is overloaded on tv, or Mom's mental health is suffering). When we put the Tubbies in, we're either in it for the long haul or must endure a breakdown of some sort.Otherwise, I have to agree. The little guys are mesmerizing to kids, for whatever reason."
2,A lot of reviewing,"Unfortunately this book did not keep my interest. It was a lot of reviewing of the plot without saying much. I have enjoyed Gene Getz's writing in the past, but not this time."
5,A Good Introduction to the Life of Jacob,"""Jacob: Following God Without Looking Back"" is another installment by Gene Getz in the Men of Character series. This title is on Jacob, whose original name meant ""Trickster"" and whose actions got him into a lot of trouble.The book consists of 13 chapters with the following titles:1. It All Begins at Home2. A Tricky Plot3. A Beuatiful Novella4. The Great Deception5. A Born-Again Experience6. Reaping What We Sow7. A Modern-Day Opera8. Change Points9. A Difficult Confrontation10. Solving Problems God's Way11. Wrestling With God12. Reconciliation and Forgiveness13. Back Home AgainWhile the book is more tailored towards the lay reader, pastors can also benefit for their own personal lives and also for sermon preparation.Read and be encouraged to know that God is powerful enough to use anyone He chooses!Recommended."
4,Brit Hume got it exactly right,"Hume wrote: ""John Harris reaches a generally favorable verdict on Bill Clinton, but there is no lack of evidence that could lead to a different conclusion."" Harris writes well and is obviously a fan of the former President. The title `The Survivor' is perfect, after reading about the countless missed opportunities during his eight years in office and how much time was spent just trying to survive politically, you realize this most charismatic and personable man's greatest accomplishment was just that: Survival. Perhaps President Clinton felt progressive in his own mind, but in practice he was mostly reactive. This well written book is definitely worth reading for a sympathetic account of the Clinton years. Summary Quote ""I may not have been the greatest president, but I've had the most fun eight years."" - Bill Clinton."
4,"Finally, a positive light on the Clinton years!","It is nice to finally have a book that portrays Clinton's presidency in a positive light. The times were not that long ago and I remember them being mostly good times yet just about every book today seems to make them look like Armageddon.Most males I know think the whole Monica thing was a drawn out charade by people who love gossip and were grasping out straws trying to sink Clinton's presidency. Those same anti-Clinton individuals try to make a big ""conspiracy"" theory out of Whitewater because they believe most people were ""asleep"" during those eight years and will not remember how well off the country was during those eight years. Well the truth is that we have had nothing but bad times since the Clinton presidency ended.Bravo for you Mr. Harris for finally trying to paint a more honest view!"
5,Best product on the market,AMAZING PRODUCT!Lost my expensive face wash from the dermatologist while on a cruise and was skeptical when i bought this stuff from the spa on board but it turned out to be 10 times better than the stuff from my doctor.Cleared up my break out in two washes and continues to keep my face clear. Have yet to find a face wash that beats it.
4,Perfect for a gift,"I loved the lobster, the only detail I didn't like were the tentacles becuase they looked like snakes but overall it was a nice gift."
1,Not A Workout Video,"I was looking for a dance type of workout video, like Zumba. This had decent reviews so I went for it, bad choice. Not only is this a terrible workout video, it is an awful dance video. Do not, I repeat do not waste your money. If you are looking for a workout and dancing Zumba is the way to go. Two thumbs down for this one."
2,Not what I was expecting.,"I expected this to be a more athletic, high paced type of dance exercise. It is not. If you are looking for a fast moving, make you sweat dance video, look elsewhere. I was disapointed."
4,Good workout,"This is a very face paced workout. It will definately get your heart rate up. Takes a while to learn the steps. HIGH IMPACT, so beware, LOL"
3,Disappointed,"For the warm up and cardio she does not give good instructions.The toning parts are easier to catch onto the first go around.The ab portion is challenging.The stretch portion is prolonged and challenging, some parts.Beginners or 1st timers, like myself, will definitely be challenged and it may take a few times before you are able to do all the moves.The instruction could have been better. The dvd seems low budget. They're are two other girls but poor demonstration of versions of doing the exercises, i.e. 'beginner' 'advanced' etc..If you like dance or culture its worth a try. I guess I expected it to be a bit better..BUT you will sweat and burn calories even if you can't get the moves down pact.I'm looking forward to teaching myself the moves so I can enjoy the workout more and challenge myself. My money won't be wasted!"
3,Decent treat...horrible smell,"My Yorkie liked the original Kong treat that came with the Kong toy, so we thought we'd get some more. When I opened the bag I almost fell over from the horrible smell! Plus, our Yorkie doesn't seem to like them as much (not sure why). They should at least make the smell somewhat pleasant as I dread opening the bag to try to get one out!"
3,"Great treat, not good Kong stuffers","My dog certainly loved these, but they do not go well in the Kong like they are advertised. They just broke into small peices when I tried putting them in, and my dog could not get the small peices out. I would recommend getting the Ziggies to put into the Kong toy intead."
5,Great treat for puppies!,"These puppy snacks are healthy and could be easily broken up so that I could make them last longer, while keeping my puppy interested in obeying my commands for the treat. Stuffing an entire treat into the Small Puppy Kong didn't work out very well though...she could never get it out! I just broke up the treat and put it in there and when she played with it, the treats would easily fall out and she had quite the enjoyable snack!"
2,My dog is not interested in the taste.,My Miniture Schnauzer shows no interest in these. He will walk away and eat them whenever. Apparently they do not entice him the eat them.
2,Okay treat,"I guess I should have read the fine print on this one. The treat only fits the Extra-Small sized Kong toy, it is too tiny for the Small sized toy. Since I have a 15 lb puppy, I have the small-sized Kong. For me, these just ended up being treats rather than Kong-stuffers."
1,Too hard to handle,"The product was to help my 83 year old mom, unfortunately the adjustments were too hard for her to work and it fell off her table at one point and broke part of it."
5,5 stars customer service,"The first i received was broken on one end, after i call the company and told them my problem they just told me to trash that one and they would send me a new one. Within a few days i received a new one in perfect condition. Now, that's what i call great customer service.Thank You!"
2,"Pop, not Classic","I really made a mistake buying this CD. I could barely listen to the first five songs and then I had to stop. The music is Pop, the instruments are Pop, there is no singing in the few songs I heard. If you're a serious classic music person then this is not for you. If you like classical a little but prefer a modern sound then you might like this."
5,Power Supply Tester - great tool,Only minor quibble is the note (in the one-page 'manual' that says not to worry if there is no -5v - most supplies don't deliver this voltage. It would be nice if this were on the back of the unit so it would always be in the same place.It's a valuable addition to my kit.
5,Easy to Use,"Easy as it gets. Plug the 20/24 pin molex in and read the lights. Check the other molex connectors such as the 4 pin and see if there is trouble there! EASY.It is straight forward but does not tell what the readings SHOULD be.Easy to carry around, slips into any tool bag or pocket.I have had this item for over a year now and use it regularly."
4,works well,"the product is as promised, i have tested serveral power supplies and it has saved me time in diagnosing problems with systems. i would recommend it to any one."
4,Did what I needed,Easy to use and quickly identified that my power supply was shot. I would recommend for folks like me with limited knowledge about reparing computers.
3,It only tells if your power supply is dead,"My PS failed to power up the PC. It turned out that the 12+V line is 10.99V which is below the min spec of 11.4V. A new PS did the trick. However, when I tested the damaged PS with this device, all LEDs show green. This device will be good if the PS is dead; it can tell you that. Otherwise, it will give you a wrong assumption (some previous users made comments on this but I failed to pay attention to. This review is to re-emphasize this fact). A good old multimeter is the way to go."
4,Usefull little tool,"This is great for the price.I was quickly able to diagnose whether my powersupply had died on me or if it was yet another system board issue.I first tried it on a known good power supply just so I could see the results of what happens with a good power supply.Then hooked it up to the one I felt was dead and yup only got one light to sorta flash a little bit and was able to replace just the part that had gone out and get my system back up and running.I would Highly recommend this tool to any to help diagnose dead power supplies, at the price its at.Now if your system turns on and has power supply issues then I would just use a multimeter however when you feel your system board has fried and you need a load to turn the power supply on, this is a great tool for doing just that."
3,Tells if the power supply is completely dead but...,"it will not detect the minor power fluctuations that might cause your motherboard to not send the power_good signal.That is as far as this product goes. It is fairly well constructed, has LEDs and sounds to tell if it delivers power at all but ultimatly it will only test if the powersupply is completely dead, not just dead enough not to be useful.Bottom line: It can be useful in a quick diagnosis for the price but simply because it delivers all green doesn't mean the power supply won't have problems completely hooked up to your system.Id probibly reccomend using a digital multimeter and a paperclip to test if you have the expertice, if not this may be a low cost option to see if you have to shell out another $80 for a new PS."
2,Hard to navigate,"This DVD is extremely hard to navigate. The search buttonis disabled throughout the entire DVD. There are alsotwo different menu bars. You have to fast forward throughthe beginning commercials.Fans of Rodney Yee will be dissappointed. He is onlyon for eight minutes.All in all, I would avoid this one."
2,"Booklet useful, but most of this should have been on a CD instead","The yoga and self-massage portions are fine on a DVD so you can learn the technique, but if you're trying to sleep, you shouldn't be watching videos, no matter how nice the scenery is.The music is nice and soothing throughout. The female voice on the meditation was not as smooth and even as the male voice, imho.The booklet has several good recipes in it, as well as a good list of food choices.The menu was difficult to navigate through, and there was too much filler in terms of separate overviews. Also annoying were the commercials in front and the product placement during the self-massage/yoga segment.Borrow from your library, before buying."
5,Rascal Flatts CD,"The CD arrived promptly, in good condition and made my nephew very happy on his birthday. Thanks!"
3,I Think The Amazon Review Nailed It,"Look I like these guys and I own each of their albums but let's call a spade, a spade. This is much closer to an adult contemporary album than a country album, which is fine but let's not mislabel it. 3 albums ago, Rascal Flatts could rationally claim to be recording ""unique Country"" but right now it just sounds like ""regular pop/adult contemporary."" ""What Hurts the Most"" is an excellent song which receives a fine vocal performance from the group but it clearly is the best thing on this album. Everything else I'd rate about average with maybe a slight bump up for ""Yes I Do"" and ""My Wish"" and a bump down for ""Backwards"" (very trite) and ""Me and My Gang"". The group seems much, much more comfortable recording power ballads to the point that they almost seem uncomfortable performing anything up tempo. I don't feel like I wasted my 10 bucks but 3 years from now I doubt if I'll remember anything other than ""What Hurts The Most"""
5,Fourth cd from them; first for me :-),"I am fast becoming a fan of these guys. I have heard one or two of their songs in the past, and something made me pick this cd up even though it's not normally my style of music. I saw them once on Today and they were so good, I had to check out at least one cd, and I'm not disappointed.While it's their fourth cd, this is the first of theirs I have and I think I'll go and get some more based on this great cd. I really love What Hurts The Most, Words I Couldn't Say and the fast and boppy title track Me And My Gang.Even if you aren't a country music fan, you may also find yourself loving this. Their vocals are excellent and their music top notch. I really love this."
4,what hurts the most,"First of all, I would like to point out that, I like the song, ""what hurts the most"", their radio single, but Mark Wills cut it first on his (and the crowd goes wild) and was just a pinch better and radio friendly.Why wasn't his version selected. But, any how, The song, ""me and my gang"" is a very upbeat catchy, rockin song. And check this out, my wife hates country music, but she loves that song, and the newest, ""life is a highway"" so whatever they are doing, keep it up. She is into hard rock and mostly rap, but maybe she will cross over if they find that specail chemsitry. We could always use another country fan out here to keep country music famous, like Eric Church sang on his (sinners like me) album on the song, ""pledge alligenace to the Hag"",""they say country's fading but we're still waving the flag round here, we're people still pledge alligeance to the Hag"""
3,"Prime Cuts - Stand, What Hurts the Most, Me and My Gang, and Ellsworth","This cd, for the most part, was a disappointment in comparison to Rascal Flatts earlier work. Its tracks have that unfortunate problem that many cd's have these day's - all the songs begin to sound the same. The following songs are worth listening to ""Stand, What Hurts the Most, Me and My Gang, and Ellsworth"" - the rest of the cd, I would regrettably rate as average."
4,cross-over country,"I have never been much into country, but fell in love with one of their hits, and I like the whole cd."
1,worst album yet,"I've been a big fan of Rascal Flatts since they first came out. I've always purchased their albums and until now they've all been great. But this album is terrible. I like maybe 1 to 2 songs, the rest stink. Most of the songs are all slow and none make you want to get-up-and-go. I was very surprised with this album. It's their only bad one."
2,Whiny voice,"Okay, am I the only one who thinks:a) this is boy-band music sung by whiny voiced-people with enough southern accents to pretend to be country?b) this is over-produced?c) this cd could give a bait shop a run for its money on hooks, but they just don't ring true?I wanted to like this album; I really did. I don't dislike radio-friendly, approachable music. And I love cross-over. But I just wanted to slap the lead singer upside the head and tell him to stop whining, get a job, and grow up. Sorry."
3,Me and My Gang,"This is definately their worst CD. I love their other CD's, and this one was below my expectations. The hit single ""What Hurts the Most"" is the best song on the CD. ""Ellsworth"" is also a sweet song, but over all a very average CD. No wonder it's only $10."
1,I'd rather loose my hearing than be subjected to this turd of an album!,"If I could give this no stars I would. Country version of the Backstreet Boys.... and people actually think this is good music!?!? The current trends in country music are like a sickness right now and it's got to stop. It's like candy-coated garbage and it's poluting the air-waves. The songwriting on this cd is second rate at best, and the vocals are awful. Please don't spend your hard earned money on this garbage."
2,They just keep getting worse.......,"....while they keep selling more and more CDs. I don't get it! Their first CD was by far their best with each successive one giving us less and less. The songs on this CD are the worst yet. Get back to basics and at least a little country (and no ""Backwards"" doesn't count)."
1,Sugar,"If you hate country music, you will love this album. Rascal Flatts are everything that is wrong with country music today. ""Me and My Gang"" is the furthest thing from a country song I have ever heard, yet country radio laps it up, and lets legends like Merle Haggard and George Jones lay in the ditch.My advice is don't buy this garbage if you enjoy country music. It will only make you mad."
1,Whine Whine Whine Whine....,I am a RF fan until this CD. This is a major letdown. ANd for some reason the vocals have just gotten so whiney!!! Its like Keith Sweat for country listeners. Yeeesh.
5,L-O-V-E,"I L-O-V-E this CD! There is not a bad song on the whole thing. I've had it in my car CD player pretty much non-stop since I got it a couple of weeks ago.I've heard the criticism (""sounds too pop"" or ""lyrics from Me and My Gang are too simplistic""), but if the music sounds good and makes you feel good, who cares?? Who cares about classifications (pop vs country)? Who cares if the lyrics on ONE SONG aren't exactly Shakespearean? (Why aren't beautiful harmonies, kick butt instrumentals, and a great tempo enough?)If you like Rascal Flatts already, GET THIS CD. If you don't like Rascal Flatts already, GET THIS CD (because you soon will)!"
3,OK NOT THE BEST,"I LIKE THIS CD BECAUSE IT HAS A DANCE THEME TO IT. NOT RASCAL FLATTS BEST BUT ITS OK. MY FAVORITE SONG ON THIS CD IS ""WHAT HURTS THE MOST""."
5,Great CD!,"Every song on the CD is wonderful...these guys are so talented, and I love every thing they sing..."
1,very corny,"Rascal Flatts are like a Country Boy Band that sounds more closer to the Backstreet boys&the slower side of N-Synch,etc... than anything that would be considered Country, this is more of that polished slick brand of music making that is accessible,but is lacking feeling. the vocals here&the songwriting put me to sleep."
3,It's their last cd with new words,"I have all of Rascal Flatts' CDs and I've seen them perform live. Obviously, I like them. But this CD sounds like they took the same slow song and changed the words a few times to fill the album. There is some good music (Cool Thing is a great song), but if you're looking to by your first Rascal Flatts CD this isn't the one to get."
5,The best album yet from the guys!,"I have been a Flatts fan since the day the came on to the scene. This album, by far, is the best. Gary's voice has always been amazing but this album really showcases his talent, he can sing any song you throw at him. My favorite is ""Cool Thing"", all the songs written by Joe Don have been my favorite, but this one is the best so far... ""I Feel Bad"" is also great. I heard ""Me and My Gang"" at their show in Tacoma, WA and loved it, but hearing it on the album made it that much better! Reminds me a little bit of Big N Rich.Good job Rascal Flatts... Can't wait for the next one!!!"
5,Awsome,This cd is pretty good I have to admit the first single I thoguht it was ok but nothing great either....However it kinda grew on me and rest cd is awsome best track to me so far is number 3....This cd kinda has a mixture of all there albums put togeather....I like how every song doesnt sound the same not the exact same style.....So pick this up go Target they give you three previously unreleased tracks so get that before there gone there only ones doing that deal.....
5,Words I Could--and MUST--Say!!!,"I'm not even a country aficionado but 'Me & My Gang' eliminates any bitterness I once felt toward country music. I can positively affirm that this album is a classic without knowing squat about the genre. Standouts include Stand, What Hurts the Most, My Wish, Pieces, Words I Couldn't Say, and Ellsworth. I thoroughly enjoy every song with the exception of Backwards. The harmonized vocals and profound lyrics blanket the catchy beats perfectly, but What Hurts the Most is that Rascal Flatts decided to put a mere 13 songs on the album! It's an outrage! But other than that, Me & My Gang exudes flawlessness, and serves as a paragon of country."
5,i love rf!!,"rascal flatts has a good sorce of music that i enjoy listening to when i have some free time after i'm done with homework. my three favorite songs in order are: stand, my wish, and me and my gang. in sing and desing class at school my friend submite my wish to sing to at our prefornince and it got chosen that is how i found out about radcal flatts."
2,Bubblegum sap,"The guys have some nice harmonies, but their saccharine sweetness is so overdone. This is just one more insipid set of songs. Any 13 to 30 year old girlies will think it's really great because of sappy lyrics. Only the title track, ""Me and My Gang"" is worth listening to (occasionally), but still not terribly great - it's just a bit too poppy.I wish they would cross over to pop radio and leave country music to some real artists."
2,Best Album Yet? Not by a long shot!,"It was just a week or two ago, Jay (I believe) was saying on CMT that this was their best album yet. I disagree. After hearing him say that, it got my excitment up for this album. I got my copy yesterday, and put it in my computer to listen to it. I was pleasantly surprised with the first song, Stand. It's one of the best song's on the album. Which is followed by, What Hurts The Most. That's probably THE best song on the album.Backwords, sounds like music on speed. Now, not that I'm knocking this song. I rather like it, actually. However, after that, it goes down hill.The only other good song on the album is, Ellsworth. Which talks about a woman with Alzheimer's. Who can only remember the day's of when she and her husband (now passed) were dating.In my honest opinion, Melt was their best album. I was hoping that this was what Jay said it was...Their best album. But it's not."
1,Heard this on the radio the other day and,"it about made me pull over and throw up. Then again, this is coming from a band who got their big break by showing a male rear end on a video. That speaks volumes about the substance and musicianship one should expect from this release. There are no musical elements except for LOUD found anywhere on this album. I don't really blame these guys, look what passes for country music or any music today. Lower than mediocre rules the airwaves and billboard charts. Seriously, can you go into a honkytonk and listen to this without looking over your shoulder? No musicianship + the most annoying boy/girl voice in the business + songs written for first graders + expectations of ""country"" fans = today's version of new kids on the block and Grammy winning country superstars. What about the rest of us who appreciate substance and an occasional quiet melody with our country?"
1,They Get 1 Star Cuz I Can't Pick ZERO...,"This is a horrible band. The only reason they are considered country is because they suck too much to make it on pop radio. Lots of bands do this....music sucks...throw a fiddle and steel guitar behind it and play it on a country station. Boy bands are NOT COUNTRY MUSIC, and Rascal Flatts IS a boy band. And although all boy bands suck in my opinion, the Flatts (lame band name, too) are at the very bottom of the boy band food chain. Can Gary LeVox's voice get any more femmy? Is it possible for them to depress us anymore with all of their weeping, whining, Skin sobbing songs? What Hurts the Most? My EARS!!! From listening to them and their gang inflict this sorry excuse for music on the naive public."
1,Never Showed Up - I had to inquire after the fact too,Product never showed up. I had to inquire later to even request a refund.
1,R' you serious? Nsync is singing country?,"Wow! I am glad I live in Texas and aint gotta listen to this stuff on the radio. This would be good for people like Charles Manson or somebody on death row that deserved some pain and punishment for a really bad crime. Do yourself a favor and listen to some real country music, anything from the 60's to 80's, for real I mean me and my gang we live to ride and ride to live, what ride piggy back. another example why Nashville has destroyed the country music genre"
4,Definitely Worth It!,"The boys do it again! Tight harmonies make the vocals outstanding. ""What Hurts the Most"" is reminiscent of this style they're known for. ""Backwards"" is a fun song (funny too!) Best message on the CD, ""He Ain't the Leavin' Kind""."
3,Not a big Rascal Flatts Fan,"I bought this CD because my son wanted the song, 'Life is a highway'... There are only 2 other songs that we really like to listen to .. maybe it will grow on us :)"
5,Me & My Gang,"This is one of the best Cd's i've heard! The songs that are really gold are Stand, What hurts the most, meand my gang, i feel bad and my wish. And with every Cd from R.F they have the one song that makes even the tuffest of men listen in amazment ""ellsworth"".This CD is non-stop classic songs for any country lover, any-one fans of Emerson Drive, Carrie Underwood, Dixie Chicks Ect. Will be an instant fan of this CD."
4,It's in my CD player right now,"I've enjoyed listening to Rascal Flatts on the radio for the past several years -- this is the first CD I've purchased. They have such a unique sound to me -- sometimes country, sometimes christian, very contemporary. My favorite is track #5 - My Wish. What a great song. Great job guys! Would love to see you come out with a holiday CD."
5,Phenomenal,"Wow, this album is brilliant. So many songs that are relateable to anyone. I heard What Hurts The Most tons on the radio and tv and had to get the album, it was well worth the money. I get more and more impressed by Rascal Flatts with each new album. My favorite song is Pieces, this cd is a good breakup album, has the sad ""I don't want to get over it"" songs and the ""I'm gonna be ok"" songs, its just awesome! Ellsworth is also a very touching song! A billion thumbs up."
3,Yeahhh Rascal Flats,"Just happened upon Rascal Flats one day while flicking through TV channels. Lead singers voice caught my ear and I went searching for some of their music. I just purchased this album to get a listen. I like most of what i hear on this album and ""feels like today"""
5,Rascal Flatts Review,This CD arrived in excellent condition. I'd order from this seller again with no worry at all.
3,Good but not great,"I am a big fan of Rodney Yee yoga videos. However, I am not a fan of this DVD because Yee's narration is a bit too fast to be fully relaxing and his relaxation postures require several props and are not connected into one fluid session but divided into individual postures. Perhaps you can use this DVD as a learning tool and use his techniques in your own meditation practice rather than to follow along the DVD."
5,very easy to follow -,Rodney Yee has a great way of talking to everyone and making meditation accessible regardless of injuries or age.
5,Does a good job,Bought this DVD over a year ago and I have to say it has helped the way I go about my day. The exercises are broken down into 3 segments and all of them are about 15 minutes in length. I usually follow the breathing exercises which are pretty simple. I am much more relaxed throughout the day. Based on the results I have to say this works. Don't expect to see results in a few days or weeks though.
4,Stress Relief,"I needed to find something to help me deal with the changes in my life and the added stress I was accumulating. I feel a lot more calm, not so quick to stress out over things and genuinally feel better about life and myself. This combined with yoga has worked well for me."
4,Classy and Fantastic music!,"Moody, sensual, imaginative, classy, nostalgic, and... perfect for the movie! This new Morricone score lives up to expectations and also marks one of the highest point in his fourth decade carreer. The movie is brilliant and misterious, and music follows discreetly and subtitles the plot. It is no wonder why this score has earned a nomination for this year's Academy Award: it deserves it!"
3,"Lovely, But Not Worthy","Morricone's fifth Oscar-nominated score displays many of his trademarks within its beautiful themes, impressive orchestrations, occasional fits of chaos... This works against the charm of the soundtrack as the first inkling of having heard its ideas before becomes absolute certainty when the composer reprises earlier sections of the score. Some of it is worth repeating, of course, but to avoid annoyance and distraction a little more variation rarely runs amiss. A somewhat predictable yet charming filmusic addition."
4,Great!,"This is absolutely a great CD to get. First, its cover is stunning. Second, its music is superb. I love it!"
4,"Too short, but toddler loves it","On first viewing, I hated this video. It's only about 25 minutes long and fairly high-pitched / baby-talk-ish. My 2.5 year old however, loves it and asks to watch it over and over again, so I guess it served its audience well! He can answer all the questions in the video with the kids, but isn't really speaking Spanish on his own. I knocked a star off because of the price - I for some reason thought there would be multiple ""lessons"" but it's just one short video."
5,Excelent Video!,I bought this video for my baby girl and she just love it! she watch it 4 times a day. I recommend it to every body.
2,Animals in Spanish DVD,"It's a very prepare dvd in Spanish, the girl in the DVD pronunces Spanish very good, very clear for kids to understand and follow her, when she is speaking in Spanish, but I rated the DVD with 2 because the DVD said ""Los Animales"" and I was actually looking for a DVD in Spanish where my kids can learn about the animals in Spanish, but most of them are puppets or stuff animals, no real animals so I am more interested in real animals than toys. So it will depend of what you are looking for to your kids. Good luck."
2,Only if you already know spanish,This DVD begins and stays in Spanish. It's no good if you have no knowledge of Spanish.
3,entertaining video,"My 2 year old son likes to watch the movie for the songs and dancing at the end. Otherwise, he doesn't pay attention to it much. I can't tell if he is picking up on any words. It is is fun, but I can't always understand the words enough to feel confident that I know how to say them correctly."
3,Not what it once was?,"I have two Pawleys Island cotton cord Hammocks. The rope in the oldest one has begun to fail. I did a repair, but there will surely be more repairs and so I ordered a new one.These have been great hammocks. Are they still? Here is what is obviously different:The new Pawley Presidential does not have the built in two-way hook I use to tighten the chains when hanging the hammock on its stand.Where it is easy to compare the heaviness of the metal, the new is a narrower diameter.The wood finish looks much sloppier on my new hammock.I can't help wondering if there have been changes to wood and cord quality."
5,Pawleys Island 150C Cotton Rope Hammock Presidential Edition,This is the perfect family hammock---everyone can fit into it! It is soooo comfortable! The hardware is heavy and it has first class oak stretchers. This will be my second one....I purchased our first one while visiting Pawleys Island in SC years ago - Excellent craftmanship and will last a lifetime if you take it in at night and not let it stay out in the weather.
5,Quick delivery and product just as advertised!,I ordered this product and got it promptly. Product works just as described. Highly recommend! This is a great product for those who have brand new puppies! Thanks again! :-)
1,Conservative Bible Literalists will like this book.,"The right person may find they can identify with this book's philosophy and would therefore rate it quite differently than I did. I had the book in my hands for less than 30 minutes and knew I would return it. I am a liberal Catholic feminist and yet I am spiritual and seek to build a relationship with God. This book made me feel like I couldn't. One of the first stories are of martyrs of the Reformation - the tone against Catholicism left me cold. This followed shortly by a lecture against the sins of feminism. The ""Design"" of the book's title is one of ""helper"" to our males. If you are a Bible literalist and a conservative Protestant Christian you may enjoy this book - outside of that population, keep looking!"
3,Sharing Life With The Wild Ones,"This collection of short stories will interest those who are wild about animals or birds. The author tells about her memories of the many wild creatures she met around her Minnesota home and beyond. One such story that held my attention the most was the two orphaned squirrels that her family raised and cared for. The main topic throughout the book is birds and I learned a few things about them that I didn't know before. The detailed illustrations are also worth mentioning because they fit into the stories so well, making the animals come to life as you read about them.The book tends to repeat itself just a little, but I found it to be an educational read as a whole. If you're looking for stories to share with nature loving kids, this little book might be a good choice."
3,Poorly written,I usually like Russian fiction and literature but this was poorly written. It was a bit boring if you ask me.
2,Not a good reader,"We stopped using this book at the college where I teach because 1) the chapters were too long and too repetitive on each mode, 2) the selected readings didn't fit the modes as outlined in the chapters, and 3) it's too expensive. I teach without a book now and use the internet to find examples for the reading, and I haven't missed it at all."
5,"Longman Reader, The (8th Edition)","This book is really great for getting on the go with writing. I am using it in my College Writing class and I just love the way that it presents its topics. It breaks down all the steps for writing a great essay and why you do it. Then it also shows different examples, both of ameatuer writers and professional writers, which makes this book and it's context easier to apply to the reader's own writing."
1,Disposable,"When I first got this Logitech wireless set it worked great. After about 6 months the keyboard started missing typed characters. By 8 months the keyboard no longer worked. The mouse lasted slightly longer. The set didn't get heavy use, maybe an hour a week. I don't recommend this for the price."
4,"Great work, weird formatting","First, its great that this work is in English. It's very useful if you know what you're getting into. Second, this book is just a wall of text from edge to edge. No breaks, paragraphs, etc. Not for the faint of heart!"
1,disappointed,"This is not a review of the book itself:I received this in terrible condition. The front cover was significantly damaged by what seems to be a box-cutter (I myself didn't cut the box open). The cuts are deep enough to damage several pages as well.I suppose this is not a problem specific to this book. For what it's worth, the book came on time, and this is a good edition: I believe it's considered the standard english edition of Adorno's work.But it's disappointing that, for all the money it costs to buy something and have it shipped, you still run the risk of ending up with something carelessly damaged."
5,Amazon item,"I used to have this product before and lost it, and it's great that I found it again, great product!!"
4,It does what it says,Even without the bands I still had the intensity of my own body weight. It is used with the ABS 20 minute work out so I can get a lot done in 30 - 35 minutes. I will certainly buy the fat blaster next.
5,One of my favorites,"I know they say you can't ""spot train,"" but I really started to see my legs get thinner after using this video. This is a serious workout; you may not be able to make it through the whole way on your first try. Gradually build up resistance by adding weights and bands. Overall it is a really good workout. I think it is one of the best out there. Actually, I found this workout more difficult than the P90X lower body workout. I plan on incorporating it more into my routine once ski season approaches."
5,My reveiw of:Junie B. Jones is not a Crook,"This is a really funny book.I relly like Junie B. Jones. Also,I think Barbara Park is SOOOO cool! And as Junie B. Jones says:""She is a delightful woman, I tell you!"""
2,Grandma is not a fan of Junie B Jones,"This book is intended for a first-grade reader. The grammar is atrocious and it contains a lot of slang. My granddaughter asked for these chapter books and I have purchased 12 so far. On a recent visit, I decided to read one of the books to her and again was astonished at the content. I will be looking for a new more appropriate set of chapter books for a first grade reader and won't be buying Junie B Jones books anymore."
5,Do you like the Junie B. Jones series?,By: H.S.Do you like the Junie B. Jones series? Junie goes to school with new glove. She shows them to ever one. She lost both of them. Does she get the gloves back? You should read the book. My favorite part is when she lost her glove because she doesn't know who tike it. People I think she has the gloves but she doesn't. I would recommend this book to anyone because it is a good level for every one to read.
2,Horrible Language Model For Children,"While this book has a good moral (you should turn in things you find, otherwise it's stealing), the language this book models is awful. Here are some sentences from the book: ""And I runned all over the playground. Then she holded my hand. Somebody stoled my mittens. I weared a grin as soon as I saw this wonderful thing. All of a sudden my face lighted up."" While some people may think that Junie B. Jones's mangling of past tense verbs is cute, it does not help children learn proper verb tense. Also, there's a nice stereotype in this book where Junie B. Jones is looking for somebody with a tattoo, because that will indicate who the crook is. Parents and teachers, don't even waste your time."
4,Junie B. Jones is a good girl,My book is on Junie B. Jones. And it is about she is not a crook. And she loses her mittens and she thinks that their are crooks at her school. But her taechewr told her to go to the lost and found and see if it was their. Butt it wasent their but then she saw a teddie bear back pack and wanted to tack it but thew ptincipl would not let her take it. Then the day went on and she saw a girl that had the same mittans....So thir is why you should read this book. well byby Jessica Taylor
1,Serious lock-up defect,"I bought this Sharp LC-37DB5U and have enjoyed it for over a year. However, recently it started blacking out and locking up. The TV will not respond to the remote or the set-top buttons. It must be unplugged and plugged in again to get the set to respond. Sharp has been absolutely no help with the problem. After doing research I have found much information on the web that this appears to be a widespread problem with Sharp LCD TVs. According to several threads on the web, Sharp put bad components in as many as 5,000 units, the Aquos D4/5/6/7u models, a mismarked capacitor. The defect described in those models, locking up and failing to respond to remote or set-top buttons, is exactly what I am now experiencing as well with the DB5U."
3,Was recommended,Very elementary. My daughter was not impressed. If you need a basic book this would be for you. Think about it
2,Little bit disappointed...,"I was over sea having 5 years old son, who was a bit out of control. I looked for help in this book. Well, I guess working with children, nothing is easy and simple, there isn't one answer what to do to correct child behavior. Coming back to United State, his behavior got much better, I guess being in the different country, away from home, it created large amount of stress on him to miss behave. It's good book, but have lot of work to do."
4,A light documentary that was both humorous and informative,"I enjoyed this series and learned some new and amazing aspects of human physiology. I would especially recommend this` for young teenagers who might be caught up in the ""am I beautiful / handsome"" worries of adolescence. Interviews with individuals who have rare facial disorders, gave me a special appreciation of the ""inner beauty"" hidden in all of us."
4,It's as plain as the nose on your face,"John Cleese is not an academic but a comedian, so his approach to a serious subject has to be a little frivolous, but that is part of John's charm. None the less, Cleese is no fool. He approaches the subject from a number of directions, and comes up with quite a few surprises on why we recognize caricatures more easily than portraits, and just what is it that makes Elizabeth Hurley beautiful.i enjoyed it on quite a few levels, for its intelligence, insight and humour."
4,Very Interesting and funny,"Very interesting approach to understand the human expression, John Cleese is a master comedian and a highly appreciated artist. As a photographer and as a medical branding professional I enjoy very much this set of DVD.Worth."
4,"Very good, but before choose...","The product, this dvd, claims some type of ""decode"" software, if you want to see this in your PC, or a kind of domestic dvd machine capable of to read it format, from Englad, I suppose.I live in Brazil, and now I had already solved the problem in PC, but I'm still in search of another kind of domestic dvd machine to substitute that I have.In spite of all, I' glad with my purchase. To buy more I have to solve this problems."
4,better than the previous,"this record is certainly better than the previous one, although it's pretty much the second part of the first one. ''the ill kid'' do good at this record, the really good stuff is Letting Go(the lyrics), How Can I Live (the single), Cleansing (the drums), Unframed (is just a great song). only three stars this time because it seems to me the songs very often start the same."
1,What can one put into words.,"I do not own this book but previewed some of it. And was astonished to find that this person has no regard for anyone not christian. Even if against pagans, the author in her mindset would label buddist, hindus and taoists as all devil worshipers. I really wonder what she even say about the swaticka. I am sure she only know of the corruption done by the Nazis and fail to realise it more universal meaning, and so would label Native Americans and practially all the acient peoples of this world as heathens.Another review would like to have given this book 0 if possible. I recommend giving it a (-5) because this book does nothing but promote hatred, if anything is evil in this world, it is this book."
5,The Best Book I've Read Yet!,"I feel that Dr Cathy Burns has done enough reseach, and the way she out lined her views with a Christian view of the occult symbols was great. I have found that everything she says is true, including the research done on Jehovah's Witnesses, and other religions. This book I would recommend to anyone who wants to understand all of the symbols and there connections to the occult.It should be a must read for any Christian."
1,Just another person fearing what they dont understand,i swear some of these books are only worth reading the sample. Some IDIOT states that this book sat the record straight? LOL are you kidding me? First off almost everything that is written is to gloryify Christian and European-White supremacy. This person didnt know what they were talking about nor did they do any real research of where masonry comes from or even where the bible comes from. SMH sad really is what it is!
2,For reference only,"Ok this book is good for one thing and one thing only, reference. I bought this knowing that I will have to disregard 95% of the junk written in it however it shows many symbols that we do come across often and gives them a name. If the discription she gives (which are all completely christian biased) are not good enough for you, at least you can take the name and research the symbol elsewhere. You really do have to pick and choose with this book but I still kinda like it. I dont think that this book should be found in the metephysical section of the bookstore though, it is anti everything not christian."
1,Christian IGNORANCE and NON-SENSE,"This book is based upon nothing but Christian propaganda. Every symbol is labeled ""evil"" and of ""evil origins"". The book should have been titled, ""Ancient Symbolism from a Christian View"". This was the most BIAS book I have ever read. The author of this book and MOST Christians should realize that there are more viewpoints in this world than that of Christians. Christians are but one voice in millions.The author NEVER addresses Christian symbolism in this book, nor their pagan origins. Not once did she speak of the so-called ""evil"" pentagram as the first symbol of Christianity. Nor did she speak of the symbolism in ""Christian"" holidays being of PAGAN origin ! Not once !Oh..and the author needs to leave the bible verses IN THE BIBLE ! I did not want to purchase a bible, but a book on symbolism.If you are Christian, you will LOVE this ignorant, bias, hog slop. If you are a non-Christian, just stay away. Put your money back in your pocket."
4,"Not superstition, just reasoned reflexion","First, the title is actually: Cases of Conscience Concerning Evil Spirits. The publishers misread the antique type. Writen by a theologian in New England contemporary with the Salem Witch trials, this work shows the judiciousness of many men involved. Mather takes seriously the supernatural and the wiles of the evil one. In this work he spends his energy discussing the fact that an evil spirit or witch can falsely impersonate and/or accuse an innocent person. This work provides valuable insight into the early colonial mind."
3,Not quite what I expected,"This seems more a fancy/special occasion book than a kitchen companion. The format of a page about the herb (general information - not growing or preserving it) and a recipe for each one doesn't give much variety for each herb. Hawaiian Fruit Salad with Hibiscus, mango soup, arugula soup and other such dishes seem more suited for those who buy the herbs and hire someone to cook for them than those growing and looking for ways to use them. On the other hand, it enables those growing a fancier dish on occasion, which isn't all bad, especially those with reasonably priced smoked salmon, baby shrimp and other ingredients not readily available to much of the country. If you have vegetarian leanings and live near the coast for reasonably priced fresh seafood this is a winner. If you live in the midwest and are looking for a variety of ways to use what you grow, you'll be very disappointed in this book."
5,Good reference book,"Information about edible flowers is not all that easy to find, but this book tells about many beautiful, but edible flowers. Includes a recipe for each flower."
3,Not too bad,"I really enjoyed this film as a child but I think the reason it wasn't all that popular through the years is because it was a musical when the comic strip and cartoons were not.Robin Williams is great and Shelly Duvall was the perfect physicall choice of the day, but she is a bit anoying.The film takes too long to get going and when it does it does not have nearly enough action, as the strips and cartoons did.It's still a good family movie."
4,POPEYE,"A clever concept, with outstanding acting. The artificial stage settings,costumes, make-up,etc are very creative. The script is clever with lots ofhumour.Popeye's diction detracted greatly from the overall enjoyment of an otherwise brilliant film. Without sub-titles, most of Popeye's speechwas inaudible and/or mumbled. Apart from the latter,the film is a master- piece of great film making. What a pity this film was not made 30 yrs agowhen Popeye comics and short films were seen regularly by children."
4,Robin Williams --- POPEYE,"Great classic, my grandson loves it and I think it is a good entertaining movie. I give a 4 star and I think everyone will agree."
5,Great Service,I ordered this video and it arrived promptly 2 days later. The movie was in excellent condition. I am very happy and would order from them again.
2,I was not pleased,"This movie appears to be an unedited version, in other words there were seens that I never saw in the original. I allways say there is a reason deleted seens are deleted! Aside from this there were a couple of seens that were blury for a few seconds. I also wished there were spanish subtitles, but I new there weren't when I bought it. This is a five star movie, but I gave it a two star rating because of these concerns. Thanks.Sincerely,Dana Longpre"
1,Awful!,"This is one of the strangest, most boring, most badly acted movies my family has suffered through. Even the kids, who like almost anything as long as it's not black & white, hated it. The music is terrible, Popeye's lines are almost incomprehensible, and Shelley Duvall's Olive Oyl is not cute or sweet or even the least bit likeable. She is only annoying -- completely, totally, irritatingly annoying. When the octopus pulled her under water near the end of the film, my nine-year-old said, ""What a relief! At least we don't have to put up with her anymore."""
1,This movie sucked,"Sorry, but this movie sucked. It was goofey as hell and the songs were God-awful. They were about nothing. There were songs about HAMBURGERS for God's sake. C'MON!"
2,"Wow, what a trainwreck!","Never has a director been more incomprehensibly mismatched with the material. Its one of those 'so bad its good' movies. I love seeing big studio fiascos like this. I can only imagine a similar mess might have been if Lynch had actually accepted as director of Return of the Jedi, but with musical numbers. Popeye just grows more amusingly awful with each viewing."
2,Popeye,The movie was in great shape but it and the container had that terrible smoky smell with it. The smell is disgusting!
5,Underrated,"A great movie. Period. Although a bit campy, If you open up To theatrical imagination and suspended disbelief you will enjoy this classic film. Williams plays a great Popeye with dialogue that eagerly satisfies and I'm convinced that Shelly Duvall IS IN FACT Olive Oyl in real life. Don't hesitate and buy this classic which you'll enjoy over and over again"
3,'e yis what 'e yis!,"One of the most interesting comic book movies of all time! Robert Altman's Popeye is like an interesting synthesis of the original Thimble Theater comic strips and the Popeye cartoons produced by Fleischer studios back in the good ol' days! Also, oddly, it's a musical!The real reason to see this movie is Robin Williams and Shelly Duvall! These two don't just play Popeye and Olive Oyle they become them!Honestly I think the only reason this is a three star review and not a one star is because of Williams and Duvall! Otherwise it's sort of dull and bland! I love the movie based on the strength of those performances alone... and possibly because I am a HUGE Popeye fan and grew up on the movie!"
2,popeye,My husband and I found it to too caotic and hard to understand what they were saying a lot of times.
1,Popeye,"The movie is slow and self-indulgent. It drones on, expecting the viewer to provide whatever life it might have been intended to have."
1,Wrong region,"Unfortunatley this dvd does not work, I have never had issues with purchasing dvd's in the US and playing them in Australia, this I do and I am not a happy camper."
1,memory of 31 years ago,I went to see this film 31 years ago...The idea at the time was original...but I think If I watched It now I would not enjoy it.however you got to respect a actor for playing a cartoon character like Popeye.
3,Returned Item,I returned the item because Amazon did a swirtch in my cart from a used DVD to a new one and I did not like the price difference.
1,Worst Movie Robin Williams Ever Made,"I saw this movie when it was in theaters, and remember laughing very hard. Maybe I'm just too old now. But much as I like Robin Williams, I could not love this movie. In fact, I couldn't even watch it all the way through.I guess I just don't find slapstick funny anymore. The only good thing about it is Robin Williams, and as far as I'm concerned, this is his most disappointing role."
3,"""Somebody owes me an apology!""","The ""Somebody owes me an apology!!"" line by Olive's Dad was the funniest running gag in the movie but then they dropped it about halfway through. Big mistake. Great sets and characterizations hampered by misguided plot and inappropriate musical numbers. Great until about halfway through then it falls apart. Definately worth a watch for the Robin Williams Popeye characterization and the great sets. If you like the look and style of flicks like Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy, give it a rent!!"
2,I wanted to love it...,"I truly do appreciate it this movie for all the qualities fans like to discuss (i.e. casting, and faithfulness to Segar's conception, etc.), but the pace of the film is finally too sluggish to pull a decent recommendation from me. Unless you have a nostalgic soft-spot for this movie (as I do), you're unlikely to consider your time or money well spent on this DVD. As others have said, the ending is incredibly bad. I doubt I'll ever watch it all the way through again. You can certainly get most of the charm this strange little movie has to offer in the first 50 minutes or so."
4,Good Old Movie,"A very good movie considering how old it is... I bought it for my father, but I ended up watching it and I thought it was great...A must buy for any Robin Williams fan... Or for anyone who has a sense of humor!!!!!!"
4,A Wonderful Movie!,"This has been a favorite of mine since my Mom took me 11 times to see it in the theater back in the early 80's. I got a used copy on video in the 90's and have since worn it out. I'm so glad it is FINALLY coming to DVD. The casting is terrific. The music is very catchy and moving (I can't keep the tears from welling up during Robin Williams song about Sweetpea). I can't wait to share this movie with my own children. Do yourself a favor...whether you are a fan of Robin Williams or Shelly Duvall, or just really love the popeye franchise...get this movie!"
5,Lemme tell you 'bout a film,"I am a 20 year old male who grew up loving this film. It is the greatest thing to happen to the world since God created it. I've probably seen it over 200 times and I will see it at least 200 more. Do not listen to what any film critic says, this movie rocks. The cast is ideal. The setting fits perfectly.The songs are cool (especially the food song and when Popeye writes to Sweet Pea, sob). This is a movie you can appreciate at 2 in the morning or when you're fully awake.If you don't own this movie then you haven't truly lived."
5,"Don't care what ""THEY"" say","This film got SOOOOOO panned. Don't care, I luv it. most real person adeptations of cartoons R, wellllllllllll, not so great. This one is pretty coool. :o)"
5,Wonderful Movie,Robin Williams and the entire cast are all excellent in this movie!It is a good family movie.My ten year old nephew just saw it and had to get a copy for himself!
4,Full of laughter!,I absolutely love this movie. I had not seen this movie since the late 80's or early 90's. I bought the movie for my 14 year old daughter to watch and she loved it.
3,Popeye,Dissapointing production of what we thought would be an interesting classic. Even the grandchildren got bored.
3,Popeye deserves better than a BOMB rating,"I really enjoyed watching the DVD version of this ""musical"" and found that the actors were very well matched to the characters they plalyed, but the music is forgetable. Personally I would give this at least a Maltin's two star rating in place of his BOMB rating."
3,Questions,First of all the movie is one of the Classics from childhood....Children would love it and I don't think that the musical numbers are boring....Second....Does anyone leaving these reviews know how to spell??? I'm disgustapated just reading all the errors....As for the movie being good as a kid and boring now....I think it's just the same....If anything you notice little things and see things in the movie that you missed or never noticed in childhood....So yes....Great Movie....Great Musical Pieces....Just please people....learn how to spell....by the way It's memory not momory....if you were reading reviews you'd know what i was talking about
3,Popeye the Movie,"I found the look and feel of the sets and cast very faitful to the Popeye TV cartoons. The pace of the movie overall was slow which worked for a cartoon developing the next bit of action, but not so good for a live production."
5,Amcor AM-60 IS A DISCONTINUED ITEM,"AMCOR AM-60 is a great portable purifier,and had good professional reviews when it was still being manufactured. BUT the AMCOR AM-60 HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED. AmcorGroupUSA is no more. It's now owned by the Chinese and their website (link to AMCOR Asia/China) gives info about the product but REPLACEMENT FILTERS ARE NO LONGER AVAIALBE--ANYWHERE. I'm looking at websites that make custom filters (basically, you can get a miniature furnace filter made close to size), but the that option provides poorer quality filtration and costs about four times as much as the original AMCOR AM-60 replacement filters. I hate to throw out a good, working air purifier, but there's no purification without a filter.There are a number of sites still selling the AMCOR AM-60 (I assume, manufactured leftovers). And none of these sites (including Amazon.com) makes it clear that replacement filters are not available anywhere. Shame on you for your lack of disclosure!"
2,Where are the filters?,"This is a decent enough air cleaner but there is no place to buy the filters or the fragrance dispenser. I have searched the Internet high and low without any success. Without a clean HEPA filter, it doesn't do much more than move air around. A variety of frangane inserts would also be nice. It comes with a floral scent, but some other options would help.It's too bad there is nt anywhere to purchase the filters and fragrance dispenser because everything else about this air cleaner earns high marks. It is quiet enough on low speed, the filters are easy tomget at and it doesn't take up too much room."
5,excellent theoretical treatment of multivariate theory,Robb Muirhead takes a strong theoretical approach to multivariate analysis much like Anderson. But although his emphasis is on distribution theory he does not restrct himslef to the multivariate normal distribution. The text is one of the best in terms of exposition and is now considered a classic. Being over 20 years old it is missing some of the latest developments.
4,Good Read,"I was surprised to find that no customer review had yet been written for this book. I picked it up recently and read it quickly. It might be beyond imagining that a story about the fall of Enron that addresses the issues of stock prices and off balance sheet transactions (and not the more gaudy, excessive, tabloidish aspects) could be made, not only readable, but compelling reading. The authors were very successful in doing so. I am not an accountant and had difficulty understanding some of the finanical manipulations engaged in by CFO Fastow and others in the Enron group. I imagine professionals in the field also had difficulty, which helped Enron Executives to hide their machinations for so long. Regardless, the authors make evident the ethically void atmosphere within which this company conducted its ""business"" and provide fodder for one to wonder why they still walk the streets with millions of dollars of ill-gotten gain (Mr. Lay in particular)."
4,Not All the President's Men,"Interesting if you're a corporate PR flack and would like to know how top flight reporters think and how not to pique their curiosity. These reporters did play a crucial role, which should not be minimized, but if you've been following the story since they first broke it, there won't be much new to you in here. Rebecca Smith also comes across as incredibly tightly wound."
4,"Not a Perfect Book, but ...","This adds to our understanding of Enron's collapse, and of broader matters, including the wary symbiosis between the financial press and the short sellers.Short sellers, stock traders who in effect bet that a certain stock will fall within a given time frame, are important to reporters because they make their money searching for weak targets, like lions looking for the weakest wildebeest in the herd. The weakness is newsworthy.On the other hand, short sellers may benefit by spreading false rumors as well. Maybe nothing is rotten in the corporation of Denmark, Inc., but the rumors that something is will still drive down its price!In sum: short sellers can be a source of information or of misinformation to financial reporters. This book captures that situation, portraying one of its authors as more receptive to such sources and the other as more wary."
2,On and On and On . . .,"""24 Days"" is both a story about what went on at Enron and how the Wall Street Journal reporters followed and wrote the story. The book is interesting at first, but after awhile the detail becomes overwhelming and pointless.In addition, the book did not provide a clear understanding about CFO Fastow's side deals. To be fair, however, the deals were so complex that even with printed documentation in hand it was not possible to decipher what was going on, and other books on the topic have not clarified the matter either. What is clear, however, is that the side deals were kept under the radar as much as possible, and even deliberately hidden in some instances.Another clear conclusion is that neither CEO Lay, former CEO Skilling, Enron's Board, nor numerous highly-paid stock analysts knew the full details or even tried. No evidence of their interest in any details was revealed. Incredible incompetence - at best"
5,"Great Book for Enron ""Junkies"" and Others","24 Days is a great exposé from the reporter's point of view. The time period was hectic: 9-11 had just happened and then Enron falls apart. Many who had worked at the company (non-executives) thought Enron was the ""Rock of Gibraltar"" and Smith and Emshwillerdo a great job of capturing the elusiveness of the executives and those who had the responsibility of communicating with the public (Palmer). 24 Days should be one of the books read by Enron ""junkies"" because one book does not do justice to the entire complicated maze of the psychology, culture and business of Enron. A must read."
2,Premise doesn't work.,"Only problem is: the premise doesn't work. It doesn't fit the historical and genetic data.The Ashkenazi Jews are, based on their yDNA, Scythian and Brahmin -- more accurately, the Scythian were Brahmin. Then the Scythian went south to become the Hyksos, and Hebrews -- joining with middle eastern tribes as described in the Bible where it tells of the adoption of children and virgins into the Exodus tribes.There was, for a brief period, the idea that there was a mass conversion based on the Kazar conversion -- but, after additional studies into the DNA basis for the theory, that was abandoned by the scholar who first proposed it."
1,Not worth the money,"I have just started playing saxophone, so when I saw this and read the reviews I thought this would be perfect for me. When it arrived it looked fine and played well, but about a month later the low C key breaks then the G key pad stays open a little all the time. So I think to myself and sy, "" It's probably nothing and can be easily fixed"". So I take it to my band teacher and he sends it off to a shop. When they finnaly get it we find out that the repair will cost more than a third more than it costs! My mom decided that this sax isn't worth it, and that we should just get a better one. The technician even said that he wouldn't waste the money either because the whole body was loose! Do yourself a favor and get a higher quality saxopone!!!!!!"
5,So far so good--very pleased for the price,"I purchased this for my 9-year-old son who is just starting sax as it was less expensive than renting it. I was concerned whether the quality would be sufficient and specifically asked him to verify with the band teacher that it would work.Son has happily informed me that the instructor is using this instrument for demonstration and that she said it has a very good tone.I'm not sure how it will survive the test of time (so far there was an issue with the case tearing, but none with the instrument), but it certainly has started out well. I know we'll have to replace this with a better instrument if son decides to continue with saxophone, but considering we are not certain if he will wish to continue with saxophone I am pleased to start out with this as a surprisingly good inexpensive instrument."
1,Look Elsewhere,"I purchased this sax for my 12 yr old son last year and am very disappointed by the overall quality. Although my son has played the sax for over a year, he struggled with it from day one and it wasn't until his private tutor (a professional musician) gave it a whirl that we realized that the notes were consistently flat. I don't know whether this was an isolated case of a bad instrument slipping through the quality assurance process, or whether it's indicative of a problem with this level of sax from this company. At any rate, if you're looking for an entry level sax just remember that you get what you pay for."
1,NO NO NO!,"I'm a professional saxophone teacher, and a student of mine bought ""Sky"" alto sax instead of renting. Big mistake! The neck is the wrong size, so no other mouthpiece fits except for the one it came with. This is unheard of! The intonation is terrible, and it was constantly in the shop. Stay away from these super cheap new horns ... you get what you pay for. Find a used Yamaha locally or rent something until you can afford something better!"
5,What a bargain!,"I was very surprised at the quality of this instrument for it not being a brand name. It came with a nice case and the promised accessories. It is well built and has a good finish. Looks very beautiful. From a beginners point of view, it produces good sound. I didn't have the cash to buy a thousand dollar instrument, so this was a great option to get started. So far I have been using it with no problems. The shipping and delivery is also super fast. This is a good instrument to start out with or play once in a while. I recommend it."
3,Ok place to start,"This affordable sax is a decent starting point for a new beginner. It will need work occasionally, and its a bit hard to play in tune but will suffice for the first year or 2 of study.If your looking to learn to play sax try live online lessons. You just need a webcam and an internet connection. [...]"
2,get what you pay,"Don't be fooled, no good new sax can be made this cheap, even in China. I tried a few of these shiny saxes with non-Chinese name, and they were #1/ all made in China, and #2/throw away saxes, meaning play for a while then throw it away. I get this creapy feeling that almost all the great reviews may have been written by people trying to sell these to the unsuspecting, especially the reviews by ""experts"" and ""professionals needing inexpensive sax and were surprised/very satisfied"" etc. If I am wrong, write to me in 10 years if and when the sax still works without $300-700 complete overhauls."
2,14.4 cordless saw,I purchased this combo about three years ago when I started an addition project on our house. The drill is an excellent tool however the saw leaves much to be desired. There is not enough battery to power the saw. I have four batteries for this saw and it takes all of them to do a small project. I mainly have Porter Cable tools and have been very satisfied with them. If you want a cordless saw don't buy the 14.4 volt. I have used an 18 volt saw and they run circles around this one. My guess is the 19.2 would be a good choice. I did not buy the 19.2 because I already had two batteries and I thought four 14.4 batteries would work as well. My mistake.
3,incomplete description--color choice not mentioned,the prod description was incomplete. I did not know there are are 2 colors available--grey or black. My track is black this was grey. I teturned it for refund
5,handy reference book,"This handy reference guide has current values for all Marx Trains including 6"", 7"", and scale. Includes tinplate and plastic locomotives, cars, and accessories. Marx HO production is also listed. This is also a convenient guide to current Marx production made by Marx Trains, Inc. An invaluable reference for all Marx collectors and operators."
2,On the wrong track,"I got this for my mother who wanted to get an idea of the value of some trains she got as a kid. Unfortunately, this book did not give her all the information she wanted or thought she would get with this book. It is a very thin book. It does not have the value of train sets. I don't think this book is available in the library, so we couldn't peruse it prior to purchase. It did contain some price guides for some items she has, but not everything."
5,Good quality,Great quality. Very sturdy bottle but still easy to squeeze and the spout is the perfect angle for self application. Package arrived quickly seeing that I am oversees.
3,Lacking the originality of their debut,"Ima Robot's second album, while a decent effort, has failed to satisfy me. Rather than continue with the unique blend of punk and 80s synth pop in their self-titled debut, this one goes for a more rock-out approach with ear-shattering and similar sounding drums and guitars. There are a couple gems on this album, namely Happy Annie and Stick It To The Man, but this album gets boring after a few songs. In fact, it's given me a headache a few times.If you are looking for a better follow up to Ima Robot's debut, get their EP called Search and Destroy. It follows the same winning formula of their debut album. Unfortunatly, it was only sold at shows during their 2006 spring tour so it might be hard to find, but it's worth it."
4,Orville Redenbacher,"This book is a particularly engaging collection of poetry, due in no small portion to the strength of speaker and tone. One reviewer mistakenly read this tone as self-serving, which entriely ignores the way in which so many of these poems express a certain feeling of marginalization which is instantly identifiable. Madonick's poems dive wholeheartedly into themes of family and human interaction in general, with a voice that refuses to become bogged down in unecessary abstractions. This is a book that is artistic without being ""arty"" or pretensious. There is an unswerving honesty here that is complemented by impressively strong poetic language, and an interestingly cohesive use of imagery. It's a good book. Read it."
5,Excellent book of poems,"Although there are other individual works out there by Madonick that are possibly better (one piece from the Florida Review comes to mind), this set of poems is worth a look.Simple ideas open into new worlds, suggestive of a mix between Champaign-Urbana and Alice's Wonderland. Truly, Madonick has something that is unique in it's character; unassuming brilliance that opens doors and lets us see the simple beauty of everyday, and beyond."
2,Like a bag of underpopped popcorn,"There are indeed, a few poems in this book that are wonderful. A few. But many others seem quite pedestrian. Especially the ""professorial"" ones, which are at once amateur and self-serving. The high points throw the very low ones into a painful bas relief of snooze. A good editor was needed here. The book was recommended to me by a friend who raved over it. This friend will not be trusted with literary recommendations again. Ho hum."
4,"Great tribute, great DJ effort","The DJ work on this album stands up on its own. Each of the tracks thread through multiple turns, as is the case with most DJ tracks which can entertain over and over again. However, what's unique about these tracks is that, if you listen, each pays homage to various Pink Floyd albums. The DJ is not just a pedestrian Pink Floyd fan either; these tracks wind through some of the offbeat and hard-to find compositions. A must for a collector, entertaining for the casual listener interested in DJ-style music."
3,Meh,"I know someone spent a lot of time on this, and it's hard for me to be so harsh on someones creative vision. But this thing got a full couple listen throughs and has now been relegated to the bottom of the pile. I thought I would like it since I love Floyd, and I like a lot of the new edm, psytrance type stuff, but this was sorta a mish mash of floyd stuff rearranged and tweaked. But hey, who am I to judge."
1,WHOEVER...,"...is responsible for this abortionshould be... well,NOT ""Amused"" to DEATH.One should not defile perfection and true art...and be allowed to profit from it."
4,Dark Pink Of The Moon,"Hi All from Bologna - Italy , I bought this CD some months ago.It's been a big surprise to me , CD is really good , well done ,and plays really so great Pink Floyd's different music .Please take care of it and ....Have a nice relax time !!!by Simone"
1,Not what it appears to be.,"Do not be fooled by these reviews. This is not what every floyd fan should have, not even close. It might be fine for people who enjoy techno music, and if thats what you like, then go for it. I bought it, listened to it, and gave it away."
4,a good book,"I believe this one is a really good introduction book for men who still wonder about their place in life. It explains gradually how manhood has changed and gives some ideas on how to bring yourself back to balance, as a man.I think that if you came to this page, then at least you can give this book a chance. It is a good read."
1,"It may be a trigger, otherwise very shallow","If you are in search of aknowledgement for the way you feel, read it. It may trigger you to set you on a path of further development. This 'trigger function' is about the only value of the book. If you are on a path and have done some work on yourself already, it's a waste of money and time. Hypothesis is stacked upon hypothesis, no sound argumentation is given, it creates confusion and fails to give directions for possible solutions. In one word: shallow. And (being a copywriter myself) I must say: research and writing is very poor.PS: I opted for no star, but one is the minimum."
1,acknowledges emotions but offers no solid help,"The books talks about a wide range of emotions and consequences of inadequate fathering, most of which overlook cultural differences. Arguments are based on hypothesis and are for the most part arguable. He treats Homosexuality as on one end of the acceptable sexual behavior scale. I do not recommend it to Christian men. It is clear that the author has a very shallow and distorted understanding of the Bible too. It creates more confusion by suggesting too many reasons for certain behaviors. If you are a Christian male in search for your identity as a man, don't waste your time, energy and money looking for answers in this book."
1,Are all sons from fatherless homes homosexuals???,"A very opinionated book. the author uses jung psychology exclusively. No other views or extrapolations are used. Tunnel vision and too stringent for the 21th century. Usually when a book is written on a well writtten subjest matter---fatherless sons--their are other view points and outcomes that can be discussed. The cover is misleading ""The Search for Masculine identity"", where does it suggest gender changes or subconscious desires. All in all, it was a negative read-depicting fatherless sons, all fatherless sons to be doomed for many years with problems (at the end of the book he touches upon additional dark issues .There are positive outcomes , not that homosexuality is bad, why not talk about the strengths and positive parenting of the fatherless sons. It could have been touched upon. The theory is stagnant viod or modern thought, and multilinear thinking.Too much of one trained thinking is not good and no credit to the author. Furthermore,"
1,Poor fabric quality,I purchased standard and queen size and found the items of very poor quality. The fabric is a very low thread count -must be 75 threads/inch! Thread count was not included in the description. I do not expect these to survive many washings. Not worth returning - guess you get what you pay for. I do not recommend this item.
1,misled,"The covers are not, contrary to the picture, pink. The covers are white. The company did not refund my shipping money. When I asked about shipping the item back, they were slow to respond and by the time they said they would pay for my shipping back, I'd already sent it."
1,picture not true to item,"I chose to order this item because it appeared to be pink, and I can buy white pillow covers anywhere. I will be leary to order from here again."
4,Good set for the price!,"This set contains everything you need to paint any room in the house! The only thing missing is an long extension rod, to reach those high places, and a drop cloth (Advertised to have a drop cloth - It does NOT have one!)... The rollers are perfect for flat finishes and the little one is great for those hard to reach places, like b/w moldings. The brush is perfect for trim work. The tray is a little flimsy, but it does the job. What more could you ask for at this price! The only problem is, waiting for it to arrive... Buy it now, so you don't have to wait 10 days to arrive at you door!"
1,Ruined Gene Stratton-Porter for me,"I didn't see the previous review warning about the racist nature of this book--but I wish I had. I read the first couple of pages (the second paragraph contained an ethnic slur) and had to put it down. I looked the book up online, hoping that the racist character would learn her lesson by the end--but nope. Now I won't be able to reread Freckles and Girl of the Limberlost without thinking of Porter's proud racism. If you like Porter and don't enjoy racism, skip this book."
2,Propaganda,"I was very disappointed in this book. One of the main story lines in the book is the main character, Linda, helping one of the boys at her high school so as to be the valdictorian of his class over another boy who happens to be Japanese. There are some parts of the book that are terribly racist-America for Americans and preserving it from the ""red communists"" the ""yellow Japs"", the ""treachery of the Mexicans"" and the ""slowly uprising might of the black man"". The rest of the book is ok-a girl's struggle to do the work she was meant to do and getting her fair inheritance from her selfish sister. I am halfway through this book, but i don't know if I will continue. It is tragic that the author of The girl of the Limberlost descended to such a level-fear based propaganda."
3,"Read twice, 20 years apart","Just wanted to put my 2 cents in -- the first time I read this I was probably about 10 or 12 and just thought it was a good book -- good story line, strong female character. Second time I read this was about 15 to 20 years later and I thought, ""Yikes! This is really racist!"" The main story of a young girl coming to age after her father dies and the gentle romance are good, but reading it with adult eyes was quite eye-opening. Would I recommend it? Yes, with caution. As others have mentioned before it is definitely dated, but she was a good writer and you won't see foul language and gratuitous sex."
1,Disappointing,I would have enjoyed this story if it hadn't been for the subplot of white supremacy. It made me cringe and I'm a sixty-year-old white woman. I'm deleting it from my Kindle.
3,book review,"I was disappointed with the story plot of this book, however in all fairness I must say I read it after reading most of Gene Stratton Porter's other books which were a delight."
3,Not one of her best works!,"Gene Stratton-Porter is my favorite auther but frankly I didn't prefer this book to her others. As usual her characters were delightfully charming,(Peter Morrison,Linda Strong) but I forese strong racial controversy against Japanese immigrants. Casting that aside, I enjoyed this book very much!"
1,Terrible Book,"I found this book to be very offensive with the blatent racism against the Japanese. But even if that weren't the case, the story line of a young girl writing articles for a magazine and then including so many of the magazine article recipes in the book was really boring. Then to top that off, she was really preachy about morals. Because I had read ""Freckles"" and ""A Girl of the Limberlost"", I had thought I would enjoy this book. Boy was I wrong."
5,"excellent story about a past American time, but be warned ...","... it's virulently racist, especially against the Japanese. Main character Linda, a high school junior in VERY different times, grows up in the absence of her nerve specialist father, who nonetheless shaped her. I reread this story every couple years in spite of its racism because it's such a pleasure to see Linda's strengths develop and her adult self emerge. Katy the family cook, fellow student Donald (HOW different high school was then), neighbor Marion, ""sister"" Eileen, and love interest/author/neighbor Peter are all very interesting characters."
5,For the Adult Educator,Language is simple and the information very instructive. Good information for practical use. An excellent resource book that I am happy to have in my collection
2,"Too long, too diffuse","May be if you are training trainers with zero experience, here you got a few tips, and maybe some parts of academic interest.If you are running trainings, and want to quickly improve the delivery quality (I'm not saying content), try the book: ""Hold On, You Lost Me! Use Learning Styles to Create Training that Sticks"".I normally grade the books for what I call ""Data Diving"", which is how much do I have to dive for information. If I get what I want quick and up front, in a straightforward manner, then 5 stars. This one gets 2. Some interesting parts, but after looking for them during a long time."
2,Not the real classics,"This DVD was kind of a letdown. They cover the Benny Hill period when he went kind of lazy on the comedy and basically depended on gimmicks such as ""Hills Angels"" and endless and witless musical numbers. These are the shows that were shown years ago on HBO ""uncensored"" and that were such a disappointment to fans.None of the classic, funny routines that made him famous in the U.S. are here. The quality of the DVD is great and it is nice to have some Benny Hill shows available( they aren't currently shown on any cable tv station), but this is not Benny at his best."
2,Disappointed,"I have been a Benny Hill fan for years and have recorded a lot of the late 70's and early 80's shows from HBO and local station 'night spots'. I had expected this DVD set to have a lot of what I had recorded, especially since the DVD's are an HBO production, but such is not the case.For one thing, I believe the shows are more recent. I recognize some of the 'girls' and they appear older and they sure wear a lot more clothes than they used to. Also, the actual singing and dancing, which was superb, is not as good as it used to be. But good 'ol Benny is the same."
4,"Benny Hill, the Later Years","This set contains Benny Hill episodes that were produced later in his sucess. The big sets, music and dancing creates a variety show atmosphere that is different than the intimate earlier years of Benny Hill. The fabulous sets, costumes and dancing in Benny Hill's CARMEN skit shows a new facet to this comedy genious. The site gags are big and broad. Just the CARMEN opera spoof is worth the price of the set. I laugh out loud every time I think of it, especially the gag of Benny hitting the high notes in the grand finale after skewing CARMEN with his sword.The video transfers are excellent, even better quality than some of the broadcast tapes that are shown on cable channels.The documentary on Benny Hill is a very interesting look into this bachelor comedian life and career. It shows what a perfectionist and workaholic he was, contributing probably to not having a family of his own."
2,NOT HIS BEST,"Although the production values are great, these disks are unfortunatley not Benny Hill at his best. They have simply rehashed some of his less funny skits into a slicker package (complete with too many dance numbers). The more expensive sets and special effects cannot hide the fact that the Benny Hill we really love seldom appears in this collection. Too bad......"
1,Tits and ass in a polite way,Have followed Benny Hill since he befriended 2 British Paras on their first trip to London Soho. A great man who has the ability to make sex humerous and funny without lots of vulgarity. His inuendos are much better than lots of 4 letter words. Any time Benny.Unfortunately...
5,The Handbook for all Parents of Swimmers,"This is a terrific book! How I wish I'd had it when my own swimming daughter was feeling ""burned out"". Dr. Arata has great ideas on how to motivate kids past that stage so they have a chance to fulfill their potential. A wonderful resource on training, diet--everything! Super A+!"
2,The dial fell off,"It's a nice looking watch at a decent price, but after one week the dial fell off. They have an 11 year warrenty, but now I have to go through the trouble of sending the watch to get fixed and who knows who gets to pay for shipping. I've had Fossil before and I expected better quality."
5,After 9 years - this Watch is Great,I had a Fossil watch almost exactly like this for 9 years and it ran like a champ. I wore it every day - and there was only a little wear on it (the lense had a few scratches and on the sides the finish had worn down just a bit). A great watch - and I prefer the heavy weight. My son decided to try and open it by dropping it a bunch of times. He didn't open it - but it did finally die. A good watch if you want one that lasts.
4,Beautiful Watch,I bought this watch to replace one exactly like it that I lost at the gym. I loved this watch because I have a very small wrist and most watches look way too big on my arm. I still had to have several links taken out of the band so it would fit. Other watches I had bought did not have enough links that could be taken out. I am so happy I was able to find one exactly like it. I've had a lot of compliments on it too.
4,great watch but...,"This watch is a great one.. looks beautiful because of the blue dial and silver band but I was a little disappointed as it looked slightly tiny on my husband's wrist. May be because he has broad wrists or may be because the other watch he wears has a bigger dial. But otherwise, a nice beautiful thing."
1,where are you tom?,"This book can best be described as James Bond meets Marvel Comics super heros. Some of the reviewers seem to think Tom Clancy is writing this junk. He is not writing it, he is just making the money. I cannot believe he lets his name be put on such a poor book. The rediculous scenes about virtual reality are just too much to bear. This book even has a magic dagger that saves the day for the team. C'mon Tom, save your good name and get back to writing your own stuff."
2,I Was Glad To Finally Finish The Book!,This book is not the Tom Clancy that I had grown to admire as a great author. The bookstore should pay you for buying this mess. The first Net Force was readable. This book is not. There is a horribly boring plot. The villains are terrible. Not even Toni and Alex MIchaels could save this terrible book. The rednecked Georgia computer genius who played the role of the hacker was awful. The Senate aide who was helping the hacker was terrible. The third world connection was also lacking. All in all a bad book. I hope Tom Clancy starts writing his own material again. I sure do miss the real Ton Clancy.
3,"Good, but not so original","Not being an avid Tom Clancy reader, I wasn't sure what to expect. Although the plot wasn't very original,(about a team of people who sabatoge the net, and NetForce is sent to track them down) I must say I injoyed reading this book. Set in the year 2011, it dealt with a lot of techinical/futuristic equipment which appaeled to me. Not a classic, but worth reading if nothing else is on your nishtstand."
1,"Disappointed, Discouraged, Disavowed","Thought I would try another Clancy novell. What a disappointment! Is this the same guy that wrote Red October? I would recommend steering clear of this title and going with an earlier work if you haven't read them all. Otherwise, try ""The Perfect Storm"". It was alot more engaging and entertaining."
3,Net Force Audio Book,"Although not the best of Clacy's work, I found this to be a very enjoyable listen with one exception. This narrator, like several others, does not know how to pronounce Gila Bend! But aside from that I would recommend this to others (and of course in the print version it would not matter)."
3,Hidden Agendas by Tom Clancy,"Hidden Agendas follows on from the first book where the head of Net Force (Steve Day) was assassinated by terrorists, in steps Alex Michaels to take over the ship with has trusted team of computer experts, Toni Fiorella and Jay Gridley. Without giving to much away, someone was not only able to get their hands on top secret information but is posting it on the net, sending the world into chaos. Michaels and his team are sent on a wild goose chase on the info they are being allowed to gather on the suspect, it seems no-one is safe from these terrorists. I have read both books and find them quick paced and hard to put down. There is Action , suspence, humor and a touch of romance thrown in for good measure. If the first two books are anything to go by, I'm buying the rest and I can't wait for the TV series."
1,Disjointed and illogical.,"Really poorly written. Little intrigue or adventure. Piece meal writing, by the two authors. What a waste of time."
1,Ugh yuck. I want my money back.,"I've read every Clancy novel, since Red October & Red Storm Rising. These were great. This one is trash. Why did it take two people to write this junk?They stretch the concept of Virtual Reality to unbelievable levels, seemingly just to put people in period costumes/sceneries. Instead of using it in a credible way, they turn it into a gimmick.The character interaction is quite pathetic (everybody gets lucky with the best looking woman, without half trying). More like a porn movie.Clancy novels used to have oodles of technical detail. He used to be a real source of insight in how the military and it's technologies work. Now he seems to just crank out Hollywood'isms just for it's own sake.I'm sorry that Mr. Clancy felt the need to put his name to this. His ""brand"" is going down the tubes."
3,Can summarize This Book in One Sentence...,"About 300 Pages of great story telling, but then an extra 200 page of complete nothing.Most of the book was great and entertaining, but for a good part of it I read stuff that didnt seem to have any relevance to the plot whatsoever and could quite frankly be left out of the book without changing the story at all.But I did enjoy the book overall, even though it should only have been a 300 page book."
2,"the weakest of the power play, op center, net force books","Of the six Op-Center, two power play and two net force novels (i have not read the junior net force novels), this is the weakest by far. The vague descriptions of the use of period virtual reality settings to perform system tasks is almost laughable; what were they thinking. i will probably read one more of this series before giving up..."
1,Generic Dialogue / Not enough Plot,"The book was boring. There was a time when I read 7 Chaptures at one time(8-15), and only 2 'scenes' that I can remember had any thing to do with the plot(or the conflict of the story). The other paragraphs were about the characters pets, activities when not at work, cars they owned ...That is entirely too much character development and not enough actual plot or action. Especially for a Clancey novel."
1,"Tom, where are they holding you!","Tom, you must have been under severe duress to put your name on this book. I agree with almost all of the negative reviews. I got lost with too many shallow characters. The VR was so beyond belief that I simply could not suspend my disbelief! The ""date/time"" subheading format splinters the story into tiny pieces. I could go on slamming this book but I think you get the idea. A first year creative writing student would be booted out for turning in an assignment like this!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Internet police save the day.Or something along those lines. While the whole premise of Clancy's Net Force Agency is rather silly, the people in it, both geeks and grunts come off as interesting enough to make this book readable, even more so probably if you are one of those people that likes silly computing and tactical reloads.Not a writer with a deep grasp of the non-military technology by any stretch but this is fun enough."
1,HATED IT!!,As a computer and security professional I was hoping that this would be a Clancy-esque IT Thriller. The research and veracity I've come to expect from a Clancy novel was totally missing. Some of the forensic methods were completely wrong and the use of VR for following a hacker's trail was just stupid. I couldn't wait for this book to end and was tempted again and again to just quit wasting my time and burn the book so no one else would get hooked into reading it because of the Clancy Stamp.
2,Disappointing,"Hmmmm...not quite what I expected. While the plot line provided some excitement and a surprise or two, this just wasn't as satisfying as some of the other series created by Clancy. The near future setting and the use of virtual reality both felt somewhat contrived. I'm not sure how the use of virtual reality scenarios improves the investigative abilities of the forensic computer analysts. I found the passages describing these scenarios to be distracting from the main plot line. Also, while I have no problem with character development, why do we need to have TWO love story subplots? It felt like overkill. Overall, this wasn't a terrible light read, but its far from the best thriller I've ever read."
2,Why did i even bother to spend money on this?,"Having read the first net force, i expected this sequel to be as good as the orginal. Boy was i wrong. It wasn't the shallowly developed cahracters or the meaningless subplot that annoyed me. No, it was the main character. Alex Michales was a goo protagonist in the first netforce, but in the sequel he disolved into an annoying whiner who put his family troubles over the need to netrualize a terrorist threat. I am a fan of tom clancy and I am not criticizing all his works, just this . If you want a good clancy book, buy OpCenter."
1,As interesting as a paint-by-numbers painting,"It's been a few years since I read a Tom Clancy novel. I recall they were long page-turners with lots of technical detail and macho sentiment. This book is relatively short, with only an occasional bit of silly technical detail thrown in. The macho characters have taken political correctness and diversity training... except for the bad guy.You're better off reading a comic book or watching Ally McBeal."
3,"Mindless and unrealistic, but still a Clancy book",Clancy's books and their interweaving plotlines usually keep you reading and this is generally true of this book. The main detractors you'll face to this pull will probably be the simplicity of said plotlines and the total lack of realism regarding the hackers and their software tools.
3,I enjoyed it.,"I feel that this was, though not Clancy's best, a good book. But it seems to me that if you are not fluent in computer jargin it would take away from the book some."
3,Very drawn out until the very end...dissapointing,"The minute I saw that Clancy had created another Net Force book, I knew I would love it. The first one was supurb and was one of the best books I have ever read. This book on the other hand was a dissapointment. For the first 3/4 of the book, Clancy goes on with unnecessary information that has nothing to do with the plot. The end brought some excitement, but easily could have been spiced up a little."
1,"Tom, why are you doing this to us?","This is yet another in a series of trash efforts. Please Mr. Clancy, get back to writing books that got you a legion of fans in the first place. Without Remorse it ain't."
2,virtually boring,This book lacked all the usual Clancy excitement. The VR was completely unbelievable.
1,The Shiny Cover is the Best Part!!!!,"I was dazed and confused by the shiny cover I saw on the discount rack. The shiny cover had Tom Clancy's name; so I threw my dollar down. I understand now why it was on the discount rack. There really wasn't much of a plot. Weight lifters and interoffice romance. Usually, I am happy with my dollar book purchases, but I really couldn't find any reason for this novel."
5,"Last Four songs are Awesome including ""HE IS"" inspirational!","""One Million Reasons"", ""The Keys, Please"", ""Heavy on My Heart"", ""He Is"" are all fabulous songs. Aaron and Jeoffrey have a real talents for bringing out inspirational songs."
4,Another set of short stories,"I like the Master's novels much better than his short stories, I mean, He sometimes cut's a novel short - so just imagine his short stuff!Still, pouring pure imagination and genius from every pore, this anthology get's only 4 stars compared to other works of Van Vogt, not the general sci-fi library."
4,"You say you like the sound of big band, well stay tuned","If you really are a big band fan, this cd is for you. This is one of the best big bands to come along in 40 years. If you have longed for to go back to the ""good ol' days"" this cd will help you to that return.This band is different than most modern day bands. It employes the old traditional instruments that the true big bands used. For example: this band uses all acoustic instruments meaning piano, bass, drums, etc. No artifical sound is used by this band. Thank goodness for this.The song selection used on this cd is good to great. The arrangments are pleasing. So what are you waiting for, buy this cd and let the good times begin!I Would Like To Strongly Recommend This Cd"
5,That's Just Me...,I use this on my ultralight. It's probably a little too heavy but it is fun to squirt through the water. I haven't caught any fish on it yet but that's just me.
1,Major disapointment,"This book was required for the course that I took, and a major disapointment. Number one is content - far too theoretical and academic to be useful for a small business owner. If you go to school to get a degree and you do not require much usefulness from what you learn, then you may like this book. If you look for relevance and applicability, look elsewhere. Number two is price - on the day publishers of college textbooks acquire some ethical principles and stop charging $85 for a book that has two hundred pages and costs $3 to print, and the student has no other choice than buy it, we will live in a better world. Until then, I urge instructors to select books from publishers who do not try to goldmine students."
3,The Untitled,"This is a great scary movie spoiledby a weak musical score and a weakending.The completely gratuitous nudity andsex scene was also a spoiler for me.The plot was simple, but good.The house inhabited by and confiningthe unnamable was great;old, creaky, claustrophobic, dark,moldy, cobwebby, dusty, dirty,labyrinthine, etc.The creature was great;one of the best movie monsters ever;a tortured-murderous-screeching-incarnate(female)demon-human bornabomination-thingy.The gore effects were first-rate.The ending was so weak it appearedto be an afterthought.The nemcronomicon and other-worldlyLovecrafty stuff was hinted atand then fizzled outand the tree-branch interventionwas ridiculous.This is a mediocre movie witha great movie wanting to comeforth from the stygian darknessof a bottomless portal to otherdimensions wherein dwellancient powerful blasphemous beings."
5,into the dark vaults we look...,"it seems i had been swimming in the rivers of shmutz for so long, i'd forgotten what a good horror film was..enter THE UNNAMBLE. They do not make them like this anymore. This film tells the sordid tale of a house that is inhabited by a wraith who doesn't take kindly to trespassers. Of course, local university students decide to spend some time in the home. Their visit is naturally cut short as the wraith seeks to punish the unwanted guests. The acting is above average. There is some real suspense here. And the gore! theres a throat ripping scene here second to none and its timing is perfect. The effects are solid. The plot is good. I have no clue whether the film was true to the lovecraft story it was supposedly based on but who really cares? If you have the chance to own this, buy it!"
2,"Close, but no banana. (Miskatonic UCLA!)","It has more Lovecraftian overtones than actual basis in one of HPL's stories and, in truth, these overtones, along with a pretty cool demon at the end, work best in the movie.It is kind of a hoot to see the University of California Los Angeles' own sunny quad pass for the miasmic, claustrophobic campus of Lovecraft's Miskataonic University, but even so this is pretty standard kids-trapped-in-haunted-house-fare.The sequel (with Maria Ford and Julie Strain as the demon) is considerably better."
2,Misses the mark,"For a biography of a military leader, I was quite surprised to find out how little military events and details are given by Mr. Hibbert. For those interested in sea battles, tactics, and getting a feel for what life was like in the British Navy at the time of the Napoleonic Wars, skip this book. Hibbert's excruciating detail about Nelson's social life, liesure travel, meals at inns, parties, Lady Hamilton's dresses accumulates to the point that it is very tempting to ""abandon ship"" on this book. Many, many paragraphs drone on about tedious social affairs and extensive quotes from letters are repetitive and boring, not illuminating."
3,Too Personal,"This book examines Nelson's personal life focusing a great deal of attention on his relationship with Lady Hamilton. It is not a flattering picture of the naval hero. I would have preferred to have read more of a military history of Nelson's accomplishments and evidently chose the wrong book. Well researched and based on personal correspondence , Hibbert's book is not without it's own merits , it just lost my interest about two thirds of the way in as it became increasingly bogged down in myriad details of this single relationship."
4,freedom isn't free....,"If you're like me, the ""you can't say that"" mentality, the censorous mentality that seeks comfort through control of others (which exists, like fungus and ugly shoes, in abundance), is a source of extreme irritation. Acting as an antidote to such freedom-snuffing mind-sets is Alan Dershowitz, scholar, attorney, and author. Here he's produced a nice-sized collection of his work, examining the rights we covet, ignore, talk about and fight about, that we live for and sometimes die for.As Dershowitz says, the contest to develop and maintain rights is a perpetual one, and for the past several decades, he's done his part, and then some. Read this clear-thinking, interesting, and well-written book, and you'll be better equipped to do your share, as well."
1,Dershowitz is a Bum,"This brain dead liberal can't see the truth through his agenda. It's the likes of this bum that caused 9/11 and other tragic US events. When Dershowitz is not springing rapists and murders from rightful justice, he is writing drivel like this book to pad his pockets. Dershowitz is out for money and has found liberal sheep will throw money in his pocket. Shame on you liberals. Shame on you Alan.This book is a good read...for the deaf and blind."
5,Soda Drinking Hat,This hat is actually for our 11-year old son who uses it for his water bottles. Now his friends want one. This is a fun product for adults and children alike (using age appropriate drinks of course).
3,Not very functional,I bought this so I could drink beer while mowing my lawn. It doesn't hold the beers secure enough and the tube always has a kink in it and make the beer you drink all foamy.
3,Useless but fun,I bought this for my son on his 8th birthday because he had seen one and wanted. He loved it and had great fun at his party drinking sunkist.It is very messy and now I dont know what to do with it. It is definitely a party hat!
1,WRONG COLOR,Both the title and the picture indicate this should be a RED helmet. The one I received was BLACK. Very disappointing.
3,Messy and Awesome,"This hat is OK for soda, but half the time you're drinking fizz. When you're done, there's still soda left so you have to wash it out with water. The water just cascades up the straw and BAM! You're wet. I'm a kid, and I won this at an arcade. It's fun, but don't drink water with it. Also, it's not very durable."
4,Fun,Great fun gift for teenage son (soda only ;) ) would recommend - shipped on time - quality good. FUN.
2,Good Idea - poor execution,"I actually wanted to buy this for a Halloween costume (The Caddy from Happy Gilmore).I didn't use the helmet since it seemed more suitable for a kids size head.The straws do have a tendency to kink up and not allow the liquids to go through -- do expect a lot of foam when drinking anything.I'm sure if I had a kid, they would enjoy drinking juice or something from this."
3,Red Drinking Helmet Soda Hat,It was a gag birthday gift for my wife. She loved it. One day she said she wanted it. She got it for a memorable memorial of her birth.
4,The beginning of an epic adventure,"I had very fond memories of this book, it was the first ""really really big"" fantasy book that I ever read with Rand, Mat and Perrin becoming instant heroes to me. Its been 12 years now and I have started reading the books again and while the enjoyment is still there, the hero worship is completely gone. I'm finding it hard to come to grips with just how immature these three boys really were in the first couple of books (and Egwene). Another factor that brought this book down slightly is that I now find the book too descriptive to become completely immersed, everything just seems to rigid and specific. The story is still a great story and I highly recommend the series"
4,Good Start,"The beginning one hundred pages has a great build up. I loved it. I grew a bit tired of the sameness of the women. The sword fights were good, the magic only so-so in my opinion. The world feel was great, however. It was an enjoyable read and I highly recommend it."
3,Many misguided readers...,All of those who have referred to this book (or any one of Jordan's novels) as the best they have ever read have quite obviously read very few books. It is an average fantasy novel that is part of a seemingly endless series that is less than mediocre.
2,"Cliche, slow but descriptive","It has been a long time since I read this book. I bought it based upon the reviews and I'm not sorry I did. Now I know to be wary of Jordan. Like I said, it has been a long time since I read it but I do remember very much that, overall, I really didn't enjoy it. It was slow and more than a little cheesy and so cliche. It was very descriptive, however. Jordan does have an eye for detail but the detail put in was just too much, which affected the pace of book dramatically. I suggest, however, that you try the first book at least. If you like it, great! If you don't like it then you can pass in on to someone you don't like. I suggest everyone read ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", if they're looking for a good fantasy epic. Ciao."
5,You have to read this book!!,"An amazing tale of Rand Al'thor and his adventures with his lifelong chums Mat(My favorite charecter!) and Perrin. Don't be intimidated by it length. Afert chapter 20 YOU WON""T BE DOING ANYTHING ELSE. Robert Jordan Rules!!!"
2,A book worthy of the garbage,"The book was not very good and I believe that Jordan stepped beyond his bounds with the characters. Jordan didn't make any of them seem real, or that a person could relate to. It became a dissapointment in the end."
4,A slow start but worth the wait,"Eye of the World is the first book in the Wheel of Time (WoT) series. Written by Robert Jordan, it tells a tale of three simple farm boys who soon get caught up in a great quest. It turns out that they are taveren (people who can manipulate the course of events), but they are some of the strongest taveren to ever live. The first half of the work describes the characters and something of their past. It isn't until the three get separated and begin their individual searches to once again find each other that the book really starts to pick up. Despite this slow start, the book is a great beginning for the series. If you want to start reading the WoT series, I highly recommend reading Eye of the World first. That way you won't have to look everything up in the glossary all the time."
2,had it been half the size it would have been twice the story,"Don't get me wrong, I love many long stories and fantasy series but I didn't think Jordan's world or characters were rich enough to fill the space of this book. It starts great. It's mysterious, unpredictable, exciting...Then the long, drawn out, boring middle. I was forcing myself through the pages, sure I'd get paid off with some glorious climax, but the ending was so anemic I felt cheated. The series improves but wastes way too much time, sometimes an entire book has hardly any contribution to the overall story. Tolkien's world was overflowing with history and atmosphere and mythology, so much that it's still rampantly discussed all over the world today. Jordan exhausts the possibilities of his world quickly and I lost interest just as fast. Rand is a boring character and the ""One Power"" (the world's source or magic) is very nebulous and unconvincing. Overall it was a cool story but with way too much useless, aimless plot wandering."
5,Fantastic!,"A little hard to get started, but I could not put it down. It was like an extention to my hand. Was anxious to finish, only so I could get to the next book."
5,ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE EVER READ,"The charecter developement is excellent. The charecters are three dimensional and the entire story setting, characters, and events are captivating and alive. Definately a hard book to put down."
5,"Very complex, hard to follow. Excellent story line.","Robert Jordan writes a very complex and in depth novel about characters in a world very different from ours. The entire plot revolves around vivid religious aspects of society, the devil, magic, and the eternal war between light and darkness. Lots of symbolism. ""The Eye of the World"" is the first book in a never ending series. The seventh novel having just been released in the winter of '98, readers have a long wait before the eighth book. If you like to live in another world when you read, this is the perfect series to begin reading."
4,He successfully rides the crest between real life & fantasy,"Jordan creates a world which becomes very believable to the reader. His characters are are as deep as his plot is intricate. He creates a realistic history of a world, rich in tradition, politics and lore. A must read!"
5,Wow...,Wow...I'm impressed. Definitely one of the best books I've ever read. I almost cried when it was over--the only thing that kept me from weeping was the knowledge that I have 7 more books in this series to keep me going!
3,It's ok,"Its OK to read if you've read every other great book out there.The book and series itself is very slow paced and drawn out, and I get the impression that Robert Jordan wishes he was a chick - there are some serious pro-feminine ideals in the series that it makes me think that Robert Jordan hates his little member.Worth reading, but not worth going out of your way to read."
3,A good- but long winded- beginning,"Jordan starts his series with novel ideas and a large cast of interesting characters. The size of the book is a big minus, especially as the reader learns Jordan is expecting a 10-book series! The man needs an editor- or ten! At least it is a fast read...."
1,Disapionting,"I must admit right now that I was EXTREMLY disapionted by this book. It stared out ok but it draged on and on and on... I had heard some reveiws about this stroy that souned pretty good. I never finished the book. So I tried the second book. I stoped at the middle and returned the two books in disgust. In my mind it gets the one star for the interesting world, not the plot."
1,"Mr. Jordan, you need to learn how to tell a story...","Regardless of what everyone else says, I didn't really like this book (or the series for that matter!) I find Mr. Jordan to be extremely long winded, and where Mr. Tolkien took 3 books (4 if you count the Hobbit) to recount an epic tale, Mr. Jordan is up to what, his 8th? And there is no sign of an end in sight either! And while some people say that the plot of the series is ""intricate"", I have to disagree: it's just a lot of plots bunched in together, that makes me wonder if the author actually has any idea where the story is headed (again, we come back to the fact that he is up to his 8th book and there's no sign of stopping!) If you want an epic tapestry of a story, try the Fionavar Tapestry by Guy Gavriel Kay (some of the best fantasy ever written, period). At least he can tell an epic in 3 books."
2,Original? I don't think so.,"Lots of people kept raving about this series.. so I ventured... and quickly ran away! This book was so cliche I had to laugh. It was so typical 'main character is secretly (especially from himself) an amazing powerful something or other'. The writing was juvenile.. same phrase on every woman's lips, same emotions written the same way on every man's face. You want beautiful writing? Go read Tolkien (of course), Guy Kay, or George Martin."
1,This Book Sucks,"i really don't see what the big deal about this book is. The characters are annoying and whinny. The only interesting character was Thom and Jordan found a way to make him disappear half way through the book. I'm a big fantasy fan and this is crap. i am only 600 pages in the book but that is all I can read. Nothing happens. I haven't even got a rush from the action which was poorly written. Jordan is an author that discribes everything in sight to the most minute detail. Which makes it the most slow paced fantasy book I've read. He plagerizes Tolkien through the whole book and never has one original concept. Anyone who likes this book hasn't read real fantasy like Goodkind or Brooks. Jordan if you read this please stop wasting inocent people's, like me, money on awful fluff."
1,I Just Don't Understand why people like it,"Being a lover of fantasy books, I had heard this was a great series, and so I looked forward to reading it. I read this book from cover to cover. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never really did. To me, it was tedious and boring. One of the things I love about any kind of story is great characters, even if there are only a few. I want to care about these characters and in this book, I just didn't. I won't go into detail about the plot; you can read other reviews or summations, but suffice it to say that had the story been more interesting, than I might have wanted to continue reading the series, hoping the characters would develop.And yes, the detail is just too much, but I have enjoyed other books with this problem because you can sometimes just skim over these parts and get to the good stuff.Perhaps in the later books, the plot and characters become better, but this book was so boring I just can't bring myself to pick up another one."
4,An Epic Foundation,"The Eye of the World introduces the reader to a very Tolkienn-like world filled with evil, magic, politics, and love. Jordan is a bit too wordy towards the beginning, but his style grows on you the more you read.The one thing that separates Jordan from most other fantasy novelists is that his characters have depth and that women have a place of prominence. At first the women seem to all be arrogant and domineering, but as the story progresses the vast differences between the different women and the full depth of their personalities manifests itself.Jordan makes this world feel alive and mysterious and these feelings only grow as the reader continues through the next few books. This is arguebly the best fantasy series since Tolkienn."
3,An Acquired Taste,"To get right to the point, Jordan likes writing with ALOT detail. Don't let the superb covers for this series fool you; there is VERY LITTLE ACTION. After 250 pages, the protagonists had only gone from point A to point B to point C and had one, ONLY ONE dangerouse encounter. As a result, character relationships and the world itself are HIGHLY developed and for me, this simply doesn't cut it. I am very surprised Jordan is such a popular author and can't immagine any fantasy enthusiast making his way thought this 5000 page jungle of details but judgeing from the other reviews, I guess thats just me:)"
5,you have to read this!!!,"These books are THE BEST books out there. Even better than Tolkien...if that's possible. They are what fantasy is about; they have EVERYTHING!!!!! And even when outrageous things happen, they're written in a way that makes them seem more realistic. Robert Jordan has a way of making the story scary, funny, breathtaking, heartstopping and mysterious all at once...He has created a world with complex cultures, customs, and peoples; a world so intricate and detailed that you can't help but fall in love with it. Everyone i've recomended these books to has LOVED them, and you probably will to. so ORDER THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Wheel of Time is right,"I like this book and the series it begins. Wheel of Time is the right name as it goes on and on, then on and on some more. It is a good story with good characters its just SLOW. My primary complaint besides the slow paced plot is that there are too many characters to keep track of. I get confused when the novel shifts storylin to characters we haven't followed for some time and we begin their story again; remembering names and who's who sometimes confuses me. Other than that this is a good book and story. Make sure you have time before you get into the Wheel of Time itself."
5,Wheel of Time for Will,"Robert Jordan is a very discriptive author who creates brilliant worlds and characters throughought 'The Wheel of Time' series. The age old struggle of good against evil is portrayed in a new way using unique characters and plot twists. There are a lot of fantasy authors out today, few of them have what it takes to be set apart from the others into the realm of greatness. Jordan has joined that world with the original fantasy author, J.R.R Tolkien. Any fan of fantasy stories should read these books."
1,"Showed promise, but failed to deliver","I read Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series before I discovered all the positive reviews about Mr. Jordan's Wheel of Time set and decided to give it a try. Actually, I didn't really have much of a problem with the characters; they're all pretty standard fantasy conventions. What I had a problem with is the way that the book just plods along. I got up to page 448 and finally gave up -- it just wasn't worth the effort to continue. And I certainly couldn't see myself suffering through another seven books of the same. This is not a new story -- Tolkien did it, as have Eddings and Goodkind, but The Eye of the World simply says and does too little within the 800+ pages the reader is asked to wade through."
1,"Copy fell apart, story not interesting","My copy of this book fell apart almost as soon as I began to read it. Literally the first 50 pages simply fell out. Considering that I bought it new I found this shockingly shoddy work.Also, I simply didn't like the story. Generally I love fantasy, but I couldn't like the characters or get into the action."
1,Audio version == yucchh!,"I got the audio version for a present, hoping to have an enjoyable diversion during my long commute to work. One thing that the audio version is *not* is ""enjoyable"". I don't mean to be rude, but where did they find this narrator? I have never heard such bizarre and disconcerting intonation in any professional audio production -- the stilted and odd vocal mannerisms bring out the worst in Jordan's formulaical prose. At no point could I ever bring myself to even begin to get mentally immersed in the story -- the narrator's unpredictable gasping, pauses, and idiosyncratic intonations are continuously unsettling.I give this one star only because I am not sure that if I left that choice ""-"" it would show up as zero stars."
3,'Eye..' ably begins a thrilling saga,"I'm not going to claim 'The Wheel of Time' is the best series ever written (even its most stalwart fans will have to admit it pales compared to Tolkien) nor claim Robert Jordan as the greatest writer..but 'Eye of the World' is the first book in a well above-average series.Frankly the attacks I've seen here baffle me. What does it matter whether each character thinks others are better with girls than he? Claims that the characters lack substance are absurd. By the end of the third novel, all of the main characters are fully fleshed out.Jordan's series isn't hard literature. No one (to my knowledge) is placing this alongside Tolstoy, Dickens, or Melville. It's escapist fantasy. And in that vein it's among the best of its genre. This has earned a treasured place in my bookshelf."
3,"Strong in some places, weak in others","Jordan is a man of many words. This should not be taken as a book, but as a series. There are several reasons for dissing Jordan: standard plot devices (farmboy becomes messiah, etc.), weak writing skills, the fact that some people never die, and endless hashing and re-hashing of already-established information. But if you want to really make friends with a set of characters, and remember them forever, and go back to them when you need the simplicity of a warm and readable tale in idealized medieval settings, Jordan is your man."
2,Paid by the word,"Do not read this book! It will ... you into the evil web of profiteering that is the steamroller of time! I gave up on the series after book three when I worked out that Robert Jordan was paid by the word. It's not that he's a bad writer, he's definitely competent, it's just that the amount of action revealed and character explored in no way justifies the weight of paper he uses to tell the story. I know I'm in the minority here, but Jordan is simply too long winded to be properly enjoyed. If you are looking for better epic fantasy in the same vein, Memory, Sorrow and Thorn by Tad Williams or anything by Eddings or Feist is inifinitely more worth your while, and will also take a good deal less time to read!"
5,Amazing story!,"My husband has ""read"" the first 13 of this series as audiobooks (he's a truck driver...LOTS of time to listen!). He insisted I start, but I prefer actual books so I got this one... I didn't want to put it down! The story is rich and enveloping and you truly fall in love with the characters. For any fan of epic fantasy adventure this is a must have series!"
5,love the books,Have had almost all the books in hardcover and just love them. Great to finnaly be getting them for my kindle.
5,Great book,"Great book. Look forward to reading the other books, I'm told they are a great read for the whole series!"
4,A wonderful tale of nobodys becoming somebodys!,"Initially, this book started off slow. A friend gave me a copy, and I forced myself to read through all the difficult-to-pronounce names of people and places. But by chapter 5, I was hooked, I could hardly put it down. The characters start to fill out, and you begin to care about what happens to them. The plot is full of surprises, keeping the reader on his toes. I worked in a bookstore, and now I understand why customers were always coming in to find out book 8's release date! If you read fantasy, you have to read this one. I am reading book 4, and I cannot wait to see what happens next."
5,The perfect beginning to a wonderfully written series,"I have read this series many times and it is hard to take one book away without the entire story losing the author's vision of this mysteries world of which he writes. In The Eye of the World, three young men who up to this point have only drempt of adventure are thrust into the heart of the most dangerous adventure their world has ever known. Jordan uses the fine art of the human imagination to make all of his characters grow before his readers eyes, while showing the sorrow of that growth through all their hardships. I highly recommend this book and the whole series to anyone who loves a book with a powerful message and wonderfully written characters. This book is worth every one of those five stars."
3,"Well written, but rather long","Many authors seem to enjoy writing novels that are several inches thick. The only problem here is that unless the novel is good, they will soon have to change their approach. Being an avid Tad Williams fan I was looking forward to beginning the daunting task of reading the Wheel of Time series. Jordan loves to illustrate his world with words, more so than any other author I've read. In one case 150 pages are required to describe the passing of three days. Luckily I have enough time to read such a mammoth book, but I still think that all this description was unnecessary. Despite all this, the book is very good with an excellent plot driving it. So I think that warrants the three stars."
5,What a read!,"This book pulled me in right at the beginning and kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through the next book, and I'm STILL on the edge of my seat, and will be until the next book arrives. I highly recommend it to any lover of fantasy, or any lover of any literature. The 800 pages go by so fast you'll hardly know it was 800 pages. One of my favorite books."
5,Can't stop need more,"Oh my gosh this is like the best series I have ever read I have read every Book in this series up to date and can not wait any longer for number 9 . Be Warned when you buy this book, the first in the sereies, you will not be able to stop there. Robert Jordan spins A tale so well you actually start to see the world as its discribed almost as if you become a part of the story itself"
2,"BORING, DRAGGY *yawn* - A major let down","While waiting for the release of book 6 of the gripping Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind, I decided to give Wheel of Time, a series that has often been mentioned in the same breath by fans, a shot. What a disappointment it turned out to be. Compared to Goodkind, Jordan has the imagination of a peacock. His plot drags on and on and on with hardly anything ever happening except a bunch of terrified farmboys running, dreaming, and then running again. I may not be so harsh had I not read Goodkind prior to this, but I have and I can't believe people actually rate Jordan alongside Goodkind! Sword of Truth is way superior in every way - imagination, originality, plot, characters, suspense, violence, style of writing blah blah. SO my advice is, if you wanna give this book a go, make sure you've never read Sword of Truth or you'll only drive yourself crazy comparing the 2. I couldn't help it!!!"
1,ONE DIMENSIONAL CRAP!!!!,"This book sure does use alot of words to convey nothing. A bunch of kids set out on a journey with some sort of sorceress and her bodyguard. They gett attacked by trollocs, get split up, then get attacked by trollocs some more, then run some more. yada yada yada. The is very little character development. Mat Perrin and Rand may as well be the same person. It wouldn't make much difference in the story. Egwene and Nynaeve and Moraine are the same too. Lan could have been interesting but instead he is just wallpaper. I was expecting so much more from this book. Unless you like reading countless numbers of words that do not culminate into anything meaningful do not read this book. A monumental waste of time!"
5,Amazon.com has more than a million books. This is #1.,"Robert Jordan sets the stage for your imagination to runrampant. This is only the first book in a series that willhave you locking your doors, pulling down the shades andunplugging the phone so you can finish reading. Keep up thegood work RJ. Of all the Books at Amazon.com This is #1.Of course this shares top spot with the rest of the series."
1,Friends don't recommend this to friends,"A friend of mine recommended this to me after we discovered a mutual liking of George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, so I gave it a shot. For about a month I forced myself to read this thing, a couple pages a night, but about 250 pages in I couldn't take it any more. This book is horribly written, repetitive, uninteresting, and just plan boring. If you're like me and books generally keep you up at night because you get somewhat addicted and play the ""just one more chapter"" game with yourself, then the best thing I can say about this book is that it will definitely cure you of that behavior."
4,A Good Find,"Well, I got this book like many others, in Christmas. I didn't get around to reading it until February though because I was busy reading a VERY good series by R.A. Salvatore the Dark Elf Trilogy and Icewind Dale Trilogy not to mention many others... Once I finished, I gave this a shot and boy was it sooooo s-l-o-w! More than 80 precent of this book is getting from Edmond's Field to Tar Valon (well actually to the Blight). Still, R. Jordon did a great job and I must admit the pages flew by in less then half a week. It is very addictive and hooks you into the characters. The ending pages were well written and makes you HAVE to read the next book/s *I have not, yet* and I am eager to see what Rand will go through in some other books, if there IS Rand al'Thor in them. Overall the slowness in the beginning tends to get better and better."
4,"Great book, the Wheel of Time is a must read","The first 100 pages or so are boring but by the end, you won't be able to red another series or a few weeks. You'll have to read the 2nd book almost immiediatly. I advise you not to read this book until the 9th and 10th come out, hte wait is dreadful. Great book."
1,"Nice story,terrible characters","The story is sometimes interesting,sometimes boring but the characters (especially the female ones) are annoying! George R.R. Martins ""Song of Ice and Fire"" for example is MUCH better and also Tad Williams ""Memory,Thorn and Sorrow""."
1,"Melting Pot of Fantasy Tropes, Poorly Written","The Wheel of Time (WoT) as a series takes off around book 4. It takes that long for the characters to develop any real depth or the story any real originality. Book one, 'The Eye Of The World,' isn't terribly original or well written and it will take Jordan the next couple of novels to reach his stride and put out something noteworthy. When you get there, you will be stunned by the scope and weight of his story, but it takes a considerable--and perhaps rediculous--amount of your commitment to get to that point. I wouldn't start the series unless you're looking to kill time."
4,Pretty Good Read,"I am not easily impressed with fantasy fare, however after many recommendations to read The Eye of The WorldI finally had to give in. This is a good book! It kept my attention and at times was tough to put down.Personally, I was a little disappointed with the ending - thinking it was a little anti-climatic after the wounderfulbuildup Jordan gives, but overall a very entertainng read."
5,Best Fantasy Series Ever.,"I have heard a lot of comparisons made between this series and ""Lord of The Rings"" series. After reading only the first book - ""The Eye of The World"", I concluded that there is no place for a comparison at all.Robert Jordan's series is a lot better.just on the first few pages, The reader is introduced to a whole new magical world and unique characters.Here I must warn everyone who intends on reading this book; at this point you won't be able to leave the book for a single moment. The story will swirl you into breath taking adventures, plots and unexpected turns of the plot which will leave you open mouthed. When you are finally able to stop reading (sometime you also have to sleep...), you'll wait eagerly for the first chance to open the book again.As a fantasy genre fan, I consider this series as the best fantasy series ever and highly recommend it."
4,Jordan's Best ... For What That's Worth,"This is a Tolkien ripoff with prose so basic it reads like YA. But, it's actually my favorite of the series, though I understand that not many agree. I think in emulating Tolkien he did better than trying to be himself. I really like the spooky atmosphere of the beginning of the book, the immersion into a greater, menacing world. The characters are cliches but resort to less braid-tugging and misunderstandings than they do later. And the scale feels right--a single Trolloc is a formidable opponent. I can sympathize with the characters more as naive youths than jaded nobles. I stopped reading the series sometime around book 8 or 9, but this is the one I have the fondest memories of."
3,Great Book,"This is an excellent story with a rich plot. I gave it 3 stars, however, for 2 reasons. First being the fact that it seems to be directly copied from Tolkien's work, 'Lord of the Rings'. Secondly, although it started out good with this book, the series as a whole goes very sour and Jordan throws at us 100 different plot lines just so he can shove this series full of as many books as possible. It would have been much better had he kept it to a 3-5 book series."
3,Late and expensive,"$10 for an ebook that's been out in paperback forever? Wow.I'd love to re-buy older books to make catching up easier for the news ones, now that they're coming out, but that's ridiculous, especially when we have no idea how quickly the rest will be available."
1,Why would anyone give this 5 stars?,"This book was a complete waste of about five ro six hours. I tried it out because of all the good reviews. It was way too predictable. You just knew what was going to happen from the beginning. The main charactor (I didn't even bother to remember his name) just ""happens"" to have a sword from a group of the best swordsmen around. Jordan tries to throw you off with a few other charactors, but did a horrible job of it. If you are sick of reading crap like this, try reading ""A Game of Thrones"" by Geroge R.R. Martin, or reread Tolkien's stuff."
5,"Grab your popcorn and a LA-Z-BOY, this is a must-read!","If you like epic fantasies, this book is for you! The first of a series, this book combines action and suspense with a thought provoking look at accepting one's lot in life. As the story begins, the main characters are at home in a sleepy village. Very quickly they find that they must leave their home and fight against a dark power greater than any of them, but possibly not greater than all of them together.The series so far entails 7 books, and is expected to continue in three more volumes. The first is the best in the series, so grab a copy and enjoy"
4,"a pretty good book, if you like elaborate description.","I just finished The Eye of the World and I think that the book as a whole is very good. Jordan is very descriptive and I like that. However, I think that he goes a bit too far sometimes and then the next minute the detail is nowhere near great enough. The book is also very long, and frankly I expected a little more exciting and more climactic ending. I am going to continue with the series to see how it is, and I would recommend that people read The Eye of the World only if you have time and patience"
2,Strictly OK!!!,"I read this book considering its much acclaimation, but this book doesn't proves true to its hype. Robert Jordan has stolen everything right from the plotline to the characters name and the geography of the world from others, mostly from Tolkein.The biggest letdown I found here was the ending. The climax is written in too much hurry, I think.First of all, I dont know why the name Eye of the world. It only comes in the end and only for 2 pages and doesnt have enough importance. Than from nowhere 2 Forsaken enters and our Hero battles and defeats one of them too!!!READ THIS BOOK FOR JUST MERE ENTERTAINMENT AND DONT EXPECT TOO MUCH!!!"
5,"By far, one of the best books I have ever read!!!","So much has been said about this book, it almost compares with Tolkien. It is a book you must read, follow Rand, Mat, and Perrin as they struggle with themselves and the dark lord"
4,4-star book in 5-star series!,"This is a very, very detailed book but sometimes too much. I enjoyed the reading once things got started (after the first 1/3 or so). Although I must say for this to be the first book of a 10+ book series it does an excellent job with the introduction of characters. I would have to say my favorite character is Moiraine. Believe me when I say this book is actually Jordan's worst book of his series and that it keeps getting better and better from here."
2,Overrated and Disappointing,"Although the beginning was a bit slow, I stuck with ""The Eye of the World"" and continued reading, hoping the story would eventually pick up. It didn't. Robert Jordan's eye for detail is the only positive element of this book. The story dragged on and on (too wordy!), I couldn't relate to any of the characters (frankly, I didn't care if Darkfriends bashed Rand's head in with a club), and there was no drama or suspense whatsoever (I knew what was going to happen a chapter before it did). The ""climax"" at the end was pathetic and not a climax at all. Read it if you have absolutely nothing else to do in your spare time."
4,Judge the series not the book...,"Eye of the World is slow. It starts off interesting but it does take a little while to pick up. After I read the first book I was interested enough to read the second... and the third... and fourth.. etc. I've read them all. The series is tied in my heart for best with Raymond E. Feist's Riftwar and other books... It is easily one of the most intricate and captivating fantasy series out there... a definite TEN! But there is A LOT of detail, setting up the plot(s), and character developement.. the transformations the characters go through are AMAZING!! Jordan doesn't carry one or two plots but 7 or 8! If you have patience and enjoy large detailed WORLDS then Jordan is DEFINITELY for you! But if you crave battle after battle then read Feist :) Very different styles equal in quality!"
3,"Not fore everyone, definately not for me.","I will attempt to keep this short, and hope that some of you read this review in the mass already listed for this book. Jordan weaves a good, interesting plot and couples it with fascinating characters. However, the manner in which he does this is INSANELY wordy and rambling. I have read 4 of these books, and will read no more. I far perfer a book that allows the reader some use of his own mind, rather then a soap-opera style that, IMHO, will never end. If you believe that wordyness is nessessary for a novel, please read ""The Black Company"" by Glen Cook. You may be pleseantly suprised."
2,Much ado about nothing,"I still can't comprehend the praises The Wheel Of Time series have gotten. Having read 4 books of the series, I don't have an idea what the fuss is all about. Jordan's worlds are derivative, characters are too melodramatic and the pacing is rambling and plodding. Heck, I have to wake myself up just to follow what's happening to Rand (a.k.a Luke Skywalker) al'Thor. Just goes to show that even if a book has a lot of critical praise in it, it's still not for everyboday"
3,decent reading to pass the time away ...,"I bought this book because my car blew up, forcing me to ride the notoriously slow Tulsa Transit. I enjoy fantasy, but this is the first contemporary series I've tried. It wasn't impressive enough to instill a desire to read any of its sequels; reading the other reviews here really makes me wonder. Those who praise it highly should read around a bit perhaps! It isn't at all original in premise (Star Wars crossbred with The Hobbit), but what is? everything borrows from something, yes, even Tolkien! The one bright spot as opposed to much other fantasy is the feel that the author actually thought out the plot, and its sub-plots, an revealed it little by little, as opposed to the fairy-tale paradigm where things just sorta happen. Characters and world are well thought through, but the execution is predictable."
5,This book rocks!!!,"The Wheel of Time is an incredible series and no fantasy fan should miss it. It really puts the reader into the world of Robert Jordan. Believe me. I was slipping in and out of Rand al'Thor charactor for weeks after reading it. Once I started to read it, I could not put it down. Best book I have ever read"
4,The fanasty I have ever read,This book is the best fanasty I have ever read and thats coming from someone who for the most part hates fanasty. Robert Jordan creates a vivid world where each word adds more life to the story. The story starts out a little slow so you should give it the 100 page test and not the 50. Once everything kicks off you can't put this book down. There is a lot of characterization and great descriptions throughout the book. My only negative comment would be that the end kind of lags and for the most part I found it very confusing. Never the less this is a great book and an even better series. Read It!
1,whats all the fuss about,"I've tried reading this book three separate times and it puts me to sleep everytime, I just don't get what all the fuss is about.... I'll stick with Eddings"
