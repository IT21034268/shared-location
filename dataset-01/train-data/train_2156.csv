2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY! Disappointed in quality of construction!,This board is made of cheap materials and thrown together in a way that makes it look flimsy! Not the high quality solid construction that is in the pictures. I was hoping for a really solid nice looking board and THIS IS NOT IT. This looks cheap and is not better than our original board.DO NOT SPEND THE MONEY ON THIS - not worth the extra $50.THUMBS DOWN!
2,Not What I Had Expected,I bought this from a web site so I didn't have a chance to actually see it before I bought it. The pictures make it look like a high-quality product but it is actually kind of cheap-looking. Don't waste money on this edition of Scrabble.
1,Picture is misleading,"They must use great photography because the picture looks NOTHING like what I recieved. The bracelet came completely tarnished and discolored. It doesn't even look silver, it's brown and rusty. The beads look a lot cheaper than what the picture shows. I was excited to buy this bracelet, but was completely let down when I opened the box. This was supposed to be a gift for someone and I am embarrassed to give it to her now. Sorry I wasted my money."
1,What?,Ask the nurses who the good doctors are? Nurses like the doctors that are nice to them. The best doctors aren't always nice.Go to a Teaching hospital if you can? So a resident can do your procedure and round on you? I think not.Drug companies are out to rip us all off? Dr. Levine doesn't like drug companies because drugs like statins and ace inhibitors decrease his business.Asked to be transferred during your care? So a new doctor that hasn't been following you can start all over.Tell the ER doctor to call your Primary care doctor? So he can get whoever is on call for the group and knows nothing about you. Right. Lots of help.Really weird stuff to come from an MD.
5,"DOCTORS OR CROOKS, CAN YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE ?","A MUST READThis is a fabulous (and scarey) disertation of the behind the scenes of the medical profession. I cannot believe the things the author tells us about surgeons, mortality statistics, stupid doctors misdiagnosis, hospital negligence and, plain old deceit of the doctors who we trust. It is shameful and a pure travesty of deception that everyone should read about. Before you get your next surgery, you must buy this book and be prepared for important questions to ask your future doctor or surgeon. I was especially troubled by the ambivalence of top cardio surgeons not treating patients for fear that there mortality statistics(death stats) would look worse if they loose a patient on the operating table. That is not medicine, it is business. WHAT are we paying these high paid liars for ?A MUST READ"
1,Don't buy it!,"Not unless your dog is a really wimpy chewer.I was hoping that I wouldn't have to even rate this as one star, but that's all it let me do.This bone is absolutely useless. Says on the packaging ""maximum strength and durability guarantee to make playtime fun"" If that's maximum strength, I'd hate to see anything less. I gave this toy to my dog and next time I looked at him it was half gone. Buy a KONG. They're much more expensive, but at least it will last you a lot longer than this piece of crap."
3,"Projector compartment difficult to open, too small","I'm glad it had laptop storage in the front- I just cut out the separating wall- now it does what I bought it for- just storing & moving a projector. That's on me though- didn't do the dimensions homework. But the projector compartment is difficult to open regardless of size. If you want to have a projector and laptop, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,"poor construction, bad zippers and chunky interior","This product looks great on the outside, but once you open it up and start trying to use it, you'll find that it is poorly designed -- the telescopic handle cuts into usable space in the projector compartment, the velcro straps to secure items constantly stick to the inside of the bag, and the zippers seem to be among the worst quality I've seen on ANY bag, let alone a $100 one.It is a lot of bag without a lot of storage."
5,A first class history.,"I've been a Team Lotus fan since I first laid eyes on the BRG & yellow Lotus 29 during a practice session in 1963. Andrew Ferguson does an excellent job in recalling those golden years of triumph and transition at ""The Speedway"". There are a few insignificant errors, such as his recollection that Bobby Marshman driving Jim Clark's ex-works 29/3 had his fatal accident at Phoenix International Raceway, when in fact it was at Ford's test track at Kingman, Arizona. That aside, this is an excellent book for anyone wanting to relive the glory days of Team Lotus at IMS."
2,"Sloppy, very SLoppy....",Tons of garbarge examples that don't even make sense....I will let the horse speak:int getColumnType(int column)String colTypeName = rsmd.getColumTypeName(1);
2,"Sloppy, very SLoppy....",Tons of garbarge examples that don't even make sense....I will let the horse speak:int getColumnType(int column) ------------------------------------------- String colTypeName = rsmd.getCOlumTypeName(1);
3,Very little coverage of applets,"I am interested in connecting via JDBC from an applet. This subject is not covered in any depth, and there are no instructions for preparing your environment for the samples to work. I HATE depricated code, and the book is full of it."
2,Disappointing as a reference book,"Seemed OK at the bookstore. Once I began using it I found it to be quite inadequate.It's OK as an introduction to JDBC but the reference section is poorly written and not complete. For example the description of CallableStatement escape syntax is very poor, and makes only passing reference on how return and OUT parameters are registered and retrieved.The Quick reference section is very hard to use when trying to look up a specific method. Method names are buried in the syntax.Found lots of typos in the examples used in the reference section.The O'Reilly book (1997 vintage) is 1/3 the size and much easier to read."
3,"Amazing, but hard to get without seeing the film","You have to see the film or you arnt gonna like this. As a huge Bjork fan I will say it was too weird for even me untill i saw the film and it all fit togeather. So I suggest you dont buy this unless you have seen the film. It almost tainted my view of Bjork, but she recovered once i saw how amazing Matthew Barney really is"
2,good in the context of the movie,Unless you're into NOISE music then pass on this release. It's the soundtrack to the movie but is meant to be listened to while watching. Does not stand well on it's own.Since you can't buy any of Barney's movies this soundtrack is left out in the cold without a purpose.
5,BEAUTIFUL!,this album blows my mind! bjork is truly brilliant. she's just being herself & i love that! her songs are like passageways to other universes! i can't wait to see the movie!
3,Bjork,"This is a collection of pieces Bjork did for Matt Barney's film titled 'Drawing Restraint 9.' It is much more sparse than her other work, and seems disconnected from her catalouge because of it. That is not to say it is not worth listening to; there certainly are 'moments of shine' in the album. But people starting out on Bjork might want to hear her other albums first, particularly the one which contains the 'moments of shine' lyric: 'Vespertine'"
2,Worst Bj√∂rk,"This album is so dull and completely random. I truly regret paying the 17 bucks to hear the guy grunt for 10 minutes. This album sounds like the outtakes from Medulla which is better, but still nowhere near Vespertine which stands as my favorite album."
1,Meaningless Art,"I haven't seen the movie, but I'm not a big fan of pretentious high art that is entirely meaningless and expects the viewer/listener to insert their own meaning. Matthew Barney's influence on this Bjorkified waste and her previous ""Manhattan Transfer in a mental institute"" of an album, Medulla- has sunk her melodic ability and inventive nature into a trifling disaster.Like most avante garde music, many music snobs will unflappably rave about but, rarely will you catch them actually listening to it. Just like Medulla, this is music that most fans will force themselves to listen to and appreciate because... it's Bjork."
1,Wait A Minute!!,"I am an avid music collector who will listen to Prince as well as Fred Frith, Madonna as well as Nina Hagen, Black Eyed Peas as well as Klaus Nomi. BUT..please do not give me this crap about not understanding avant garde music. If it looks like crap, smells like crap, sounds like crap - well, it probably is. Or at least do not call this a masterpiece!!! Vespertine is Bjork last true recording, in my opinion. Full of raw energy and brilliant imagery. But this? I don't think so. I need a visual when listening to this. Not good!! I believe if Bjork wants people to lay down cash for her work, she should do a little of both sides of herself. Like Coltrane, some music is for insiders only, which leave alot of us out..and we're not ALL trendoids!!I'll pass, thank you very much & I am not ashamed to say so!!"
1,She needs R.Kelly to get Her in Tune,Bjork is One of the Most Overrated Acts that I have ever Heard.this Album reflects Her shortcomings.Boring Music&She Still sounds like a alley Cat Being hit over the Head with a Broom.when Bjork learns about Pitch&Tone she should Call R.Kelly up for some Music Lessons.Vocally she still is Straining.
3,Nice,"It's quite thin, and 5 yards goes pretty fast so buy an extra roll. On both ends, some of the tape comes stuck to itself so that part was wasted. Also if you're wrapping something small and curvy (I was coating a PVC playstand for my parrot) the wide width means that you get a lot of wrinkles and wasted yardage. In just a couple weeks, it's already unsticking in places where I didn't have enough for a huge overlap. Overalll ok for what I wanted it for. As it's so thin I might not use it on horses though."
2,Meh,"Trying to bandage my cat is like trying to keep cooked spaghetti in a straw. She gets out of this in about 2 minutes flat. It is good and sticky, though, so if a pet can't reach it....."
1,"Poorly made, definitely NOT commercial quality.","The title says it all -- very poor quality -- cheaply made. 1.) Rack was bowed upward. 2.) I own cheaper cooling racks with better aligned wires and feet. 3.) It looks MUCH sturdier/heavier in the picture than it actually is.I bought it because it looked like a quality rack in the picture and the description says ""commercial"" quality. I know what commercial quality is -- I work with commercial products and even though I didn't expect this to be along those lines -- I expected better than what it is.I also purchased theCulinary Institute of America 10"" x 15"" Cooling Rackwhich is much sturdier and better made. It also fits nicely into my stainless steel jelly roll pan.The up-side, I returned it and Amazon was VERY fast to refund my purchase. THANK YOU, AMAZON! You get 5 Stars on deliver and return/refund!!"
2,cross-wire grid cooling rack,"The rack was improperly packed, at the bottom of some very heavy books. This crushed the feet of the rack which were supposed to be raised. The price was good but not worth the money to ship it back."
2,The movie was just bleh.,"I was expecting something more along the quality of Archie's Weird Mysteries, but the movie was just boring and corny in a bad way. Granted, it didn't cost much, but still, I wish the movie had been better.As is, I really don't get why this movie needed to exist."
2,Disappointing,Thought that these bowls would be deeper based on the circumference. Not bad as a soup bowl but noware deep enough for a breakfast of cerial and fruits or a good multivegetable salad
4,"Thanks Ronco, for nothing","Tried to order this block from Ronco,[I already ordered and recieved a Knife set & a block]and was told I HAD to order another Knife set to recieve a block. Went to Amazon, NO Problem! Recieved the block just a few days later. Thank you Amazon, I will cotinue to do bussiness with You."
2,Bad Quality,I ended up returning this item. It was not good quality. I couldn't read some of the lettering because there was wood chips either running through it or taken out of it. The lettering is sure to come off or fade really fast and easy. It would be nice if it was $10 because that's def. all it's worth. I wish it was nice because I got the knife set for Christmas! :( Which isn't the best knife set in the world either but I can't spend my whole life complaining. I wouldn't recommend this product.
3,does the job,"If you have the six star+ knife set, you'll be hard pressed to find a knife block that will hold them all besides this one... and it's a decent price... and it even has each slot labled for which knife goes in it.on the down side- though it is solid, it looks like it was made from pine 2x4s, and as mentioned in other reviews, the slots don't always perfectly hold the knife that belongs in it. Also, due to the slant they put on it (to make the knives more accessible), it takes up a pretty good chunk of counter real estate. I wish it was a little better made, and a bit more upright, but if you have the Six Star+ knife set, I would still recommend it for storage."
2,PRODUCT DESCRIPTION MISLEADING,AD SHOULD STATE THAT BLOCK IS NOT HARD WOOD!! BLOCK HAS MANY SPLITS AND CRACKS
3,Review,"Product issues due to shipping agent, but seller made trade right....would do business with again...."
1,Very Poor Quality,"Quality of item is pathetically low, with splintered wood, cracked block face, chipped slot openings, and what not. This block cannot be given away in a store if you see it in person. If you buy it, expect to ship it back."
3,Good value yet quality needs to be improved...,"I have been shopping around for a knife block with LOTs of slots...and this one came into search result with a good review and definitely the slots will fit my need. It arrived on time, but when I opened it, it's kinda disappointed to see some small cracks on the side of block - apparently it didn't go through necessary wood treatment (e.g. mineral oil and such)...I ended up doing this step by myself before starting to use it. I would still say it's a good buy for me, but for people that won't bother doing this step by themselves, you might want to choose sth nicer that have been treated with mineral oils in the correct way..."
3,Good looking but not hard wood.,The block sure is good looking but a little overpriced and the worse is it's not made of hardwood.
5,exellent knife storage rack with labels,"i do not have to look around for a particular knife, i just read the labels and gottcha!"
5,Butcher block,I felt the product is very good and very well represented in the description. It arrived in a timely manner and the price was reasonable
4,Hoorahhhh Free shipping!,"Been waiting a year to find this with free shipping! Great inexpensive knife block, knives are great for the price if you don't pay Ronco's shipping!!"
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!,Item arrived in great condition. It's actually better than I expected. Now I have a place to store all of my knives instead of the top kitchen drawer.
3,Ronco Knife Block,"Very functional but not the best of quality. But then again, a definite value for the purchase price."
3,Was this made By 10 Year Old?,"This item is made of pine, not hardwood. It does it's function of holding the complete set of knifes but looks like it was made as a middle school woodworking project. There are saw marks all over it. This really shows that they are mass produced but if this was Oak or another hardwood it would probably cost $150."
3,Blade Board,Several of the slots where not designed correctly. I had to go in with a chisel to even the sides out so the knife would fit it. If I would have known the quality of the product I would not have purchased it. I had to fix several slots which the seller did not advise. After fixing the errors it know works. Not a good product to purchase.
1,Junk,"Received as a Christmas gift. It came broken; the glue holding the two major sections together had failed because of warpage in the larger piece. The box says ""hardwood"" ... looks like basic pine to me, I can scratch it with my thumbnail.This one's going back. I'll either order a different brand or talk to my local cabinet maker."
3,Maybe I got a Monday one?,"Mine had issues that I could fix and live with. The wood was unfinished... raw wood. Left like this, it would be stained on the first spaghetti night. I hit it with a spray can of Varathane semi-gloss, now it looks right and will last much longer. Problem #2: Knife slots were not cleaned out. Nothing a small file didn't fix in a few minutes. So, I ended up spending an extra $10 to make it right. Now I am, not proud, but content to have it in my kitchen. To those wondering, I could not identify the wood. It is not a classic hardwood, not pine either. Poplar?Also, depending on the knife set you have, you may end up with some odd blanks. The upper left slot is for the OPTIONAL Ronco Rocker Knife, and it is an odd shape. I'll probably end up buying the rocker knife just to fill the slot."
3,"Good, not great","My husband had bought me the set of Six Star + knives and wooden knife block several years ago, through Ronco directly. The block I have from then, is built much better than the one I just purchase for a gift. The edges on the block I just bought are rough and not rounded, the assembly isn't as precise. But over-all it is still good and holds the Six Star knives I had purchase elsewhere."
3,Eh - it's ok.. but I've heard better....,"Perhaps it's the traditionalist in me, but the dance track background got a bit repetitious, and even though the treatment of traditional Christmas music is still in there in the mix, with all the beauty of native american flutes, chanting and so forth, it's just not what I had hoped for. I was looking for something different, haunting, and yes, I did get something very different.. Not sure if it'll grow on me with repeated plays, or if it's destined to be put aside on a shelf, or better yet, sold to someone else.."
5,Extremely Under-rated,"This album is the long-lost Slowdive album. Originally issued in 1995 it quickly fell into obscurity due to poor reviews and subsequently poor sales and hasn't been re-issued since. Fortunately, it is now back in print and remastered. But be warned, while it still retains a strong Slowdive feel, it is a far departure from both 'Just for a Day' and 'Souvlaki'. It is actually more atmoshperic and dream-like. Some have accused it of sounding too much like a new-age album, but I don't think that's true simply because the songs are way too depressing to be ""new-age"". But the same is true of all their albums."
1,I LOVE Slowdive....but this is a disaster,I was so excited to listen to this cd when I got it...boy what a disappointment. No sweeping guitars....no ethereal vocals....nothing.After reading the historical write-up in the cd sleeve I realized why they put out this album.....to get back at the folks who had suppposedly wronged them. What they should have done was put out an amazing album so that another company would pick them up.....but instead they chose this outcome....truly disappointing.After Just for a Day and Souvlaki (both stellar albums) this album is unlistenable....and believe me I've tried.
2,Tedious,"Perhaps it's me but this game is a little slow moving and a bit boring. I played it a lot for a couple days and haven't touched it in several months. I am sure I will play it again but only a little at a time. Granted, the fact that I am not very good at this gain may taint my opinion."
5,"Delta Makes a Fabulous 12"" Compound Miter Saw","The Delta 12"" compound miter saw is worth ever penny. Excellent heavy-duty construction and great power and accuracy. Make sure you buy one with twin laser guides - you'll never want to use a saw without a laser again."
1,Chemical Smell,I finally just threw them out. They were apparently cured with some chemical and the smell was terrible.
4,Can't Beat the Price!,"You could probably find higher quality cutting boards, but not for this price! Mine were free of any flaws or defects when I received them, so I can't complain. Just use common sense in use and care of them: don't put them through the dish washer (it dries them out, destroys the protective coating) and don't leave them soaking in water for too long. I know this from experience- my husband did those things to a previous set I had. That aside, they are definately a good buy for the price!"
1,not worth the money,"I bought this because of the great price being offered on Amazon. However, within the first few uses of the smallest cutting board, it started to split. The board is made up of several pieces of wood probably glued together. If you let the wood soak too much water up and don't let it dry out properly, it will crack and warp and there's nothing you can do but throw it away.Trust me, you get what you pay for and this was not worth the money or time to find it out."
1,So poorly made they might not be food-safe,"When we received these, two of the three boards had an areas so rough that they had splinters. We had to wonder what would happen to food put on those. And there were cracks too. If my child made these in shop class, I'd be proud, but I wouldn't actually use them. We'll return these, at seller's expense, because they didn't actually sell us cutting boards but slabs of wood shaped sort of like cutting boards."
1,Horrible quality,We ordered these with our new knife set as they look good and come from a known brand. When we opened tehm up every corner was mis-cut and had splinters and cracks. The finish was not smooth. It woudl be dangerous to use these for food prep or to even handle them due to all teh splinters and rough edges. Amazon was fantastic on the return policy so we are not stuck with these. We will try another set and see if it was a one time deal.
1,Warped,"These boards are horrible. They warp when wet which makes them unusable as a steady uniform cutting surface, which is what a cutting board is for. I've thrown two of them away already, and I am considering tossing the third one even before I can find a replacement because they unsteadiness makes it unsafe."
3,My mistake,"Okay boards, but a little thin. I bought them for the grooves. Definitely don't put them in the dishwasher. Mine split and warped after the first and second washes, respectively. Didn't have this problem with an older, thicker Farberware board."
1,"2 weeks of use, all 3 are warped and beginning to crack","I rarely leave reviews but am so disappointed with these cutting boards that I felt it was necessary. We've used them for two weeks, frequently, and have only hand washed them. All three cutting boards are now warped and wobbly. The largest has two very large cracks and the others are showing signs of cracks forming. We will be replacing with quality cutting boards."
1,Cutting Boards Cracked,Six weeks of use and two of the three boards are cracked. Very unhappy with the quality of these cutting boards.
2,Cheap,"I was looking for a nice wood cutting board and when I came across this set, I thought it was perfect! My husband does most of the cooking, so I knew he would appreciate the different sizes and I was hoping that the ridges around the edges would help contain his messes.When they arrived, I opened the box and couldn't believe how thin these boards were! The three stacked together were just about as thick as what I would expect one board to be. When they were used, the wood isn't that durable - after just a couple uses, you could see knife marks and splintering.I wouldn't recommend these boards to anyone, although....I did give two stars because you CAN cut on them (so they are somewhat utilitarian)."
2,Wood chips and lifts up!,Would recommend purchasing cutting board made of better quality wood. I am on a second set after defective ones sent back. Same problem occurs. Wood lifts from cutting surface. You get what you pay for with this product.
5,Sturdy and very useful,"These cutting boards offer versatility due to the three different sizes. For the price the set is a steal. They are very sturdy. I like the fact that one side is smooth and the other side has grooved edges for cutting produce or meat with liquid in it. I love it, love it, love it. Great product."
2,scuse me?,"The boards are only 1/2"" thick.Sealed with food grade oil? Not mine. They're not sealed with anything. It's dry wood.You get what you pay for.A cheap cutting board."
4,Great Board,"Have been using these for a while and they held up pretty well, like the quality and look. Will be looking to upgrade to bamboo in the future."
3,Good Value,Good value for your money but not the best product out there. These are made from multiple pieces bonded lengthwise so can split easily.Make sure you pre-treat with oil first.
3,You get what you pay for,"I have only used these a few times and can attest that the saying is true - 'you get what you pay for.' They are fine for the price, but don't expect these to be an investment - my knives have already left marks all over the board."
2,Depends on how it's used.,"My bride purchased the large board at Target or KMart when I wasn't quick enough to replace the old 1-1/2"" board that had serviced us very well for the last 20 years. The old board was kept on the counter top next to the sink and was used only on one side. The other side had rubber feet that kept the board off the counter, kept it from sliding and circulated air under the board. After leaving the new board on the counter for a couple of weeks, it warped and became moldy. So if your looking for a board to store in the cupbord,and clean and dry after every use, it's OK. Otherwise save your pennies and buy something with a little more heft. By the way, I'm at this site looking for a new Boos Board."
1,Wood Splits after some time,"I felt this was an excellent buy. After about 6 months ofuse, I am looking for another set since the wood split on each one.Split wood on cutting boards can be dangerous since it can trap germs."
3,Good for the price,"Decent cutting boards, for better quality, you'll need better quality wood, which obviously costs more. So for the price, these are fine, and they'll last you a long time if they're cared for. The important part is to wash them and let them dry right away. Leaving them wet causes the wood to warp, and this caused two of my boards to split in half where the wood was joined."
4,"Decent value, the med and small board are on the small side","The wood is decent. The large board is good for everyday use. However, the medium is a bit cramped for routine use. The small is only good for cheeses and such."
2,You get what you pay for,"First thing, one of the boards was missing, when this was shipped to me, but I'm not even including that in the evaluation since I don't know who's fault that is.It really doesn't matter, because the boards that remained, just didn't last. After a few months, the finish was coming off, they looked terrible and they felt like sandpaper and soon after, they began to split and fall apart. My experience with cutting boards is they should last years not months.So yes, they don't cost much, which is why I did not give a one star rating, and maybe they just have uneven quality control, because a lot of the reviews are positive, but I think most people will be happier with a higher quality purchase."
4,Great product,I enjoyed using the cuttingboards. The larger board I used mostly. I bought my first set in the summer. However after using more of the larger board it split in half. So therefore I had to purchase another one in October. This one is lasting longer.
2,Cheap -,Price too good to be true. You get what you pay for.$5.99 3 cutting boards - cracked after first use.
3,If is fine except the smell.,I would rate this produce at a normal to medium grade.It works fine but there is a noticable smell of the wood.
2,pretty flimsy,"I got these on sale recently - and I guess you get what you pay for. My girlfriend put one in the dishwasher (don't know if they are dishwasher safe or not) and it basically fell apart - got a huge crack down the middle. The smaller one actually broke. These don't seem to be made of one piece of wood, but three pieces glued together. avoid."
1,It's to thin and keep sliding,"I bought it for $9.99 without looking carefully at the description or the picture. First time open it, I said ""uh oh"", it's just too thin. When I use it, it keeps sliding over the counter and doesn't give me the feeling of secure. Instead I was afraid of cutting the board in half. Anyway... that's my review, I do not like it and I'm stuck with it. Recently, I bought a set of 2 bamboo cutting board from Costco, and I immediately like it. HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND this Farberware 3-piece of junk."
3,cutting board,"Not a bad item for the price....I have a small kitchen and the different sizes help. Good quality for the price, but the shipping costs as much as the product."
2,Great - for the price point,"These are not your mother's cutting boards that will last a lifetime. The wood is soft and marks deeply. Marks are standard fare for a cutting board, but the softer the wood, deeper the cutmark. But for the price point they serve the purpose well."
5,Good Cutting Board Set For The Price!,"For the Friday sale price of $9.99, I got 3 wooden cutting boards. Because I am an Amazon Prime customer, I get the 2 day shipping, which is a bargain at $89.99 per year! But back to the cutting boards, at this price you can replace them once a year! Simply put - use your wooden cutting boards for fresh fruits and vegetables, and get a plastic one for raw meats.This is a bargain because you'd pay the same price for the large size board in most stores, and here you get 3!"
4,A very good deal!,"I only used these boards for 6 months but had no problems with them. Since I like using separate boards for meat, vegetables and bread, the set of three came in handy and were very inexpensive. You really can't be the price. I used the boards about two to three times a week during those six months and they never cracked on me. I always hand wash the cutting boards and let them air dry."
3,3 piece cutting board set by Farberware,"Initially I was very impressed with this product. I had ordered 4 sets of the three piece to be used as awards at a dog show. They were to be engraved. Upon opening all the packages, I found that a few of them had very rough edges around the groove. It can be gently sanded smooth, but I was disappointed that Quality Control didn't catch that.On the whole, this is a wonderful product and I wouldn't hesitate purchasing it again."
2,"cheap, chemical smell, warps quickly","Whatever vinyl finish they put on these boards is horrible. I tried washing them repeatedly, then finally had to soak them which was terrible on the wood. Only the smallest size is now acceptable to use. They are a good price and the sizes are perfect but the chemical smell is so worrisome that I feel apprehensive about using them because I don't know what will come off on the items I'm cutting."
1,"Awful smell, warped, terrible boards",I bought these boards and I guess I should have known by the too good to be true price. When you get them wet they make a terrible smell (I thought it was rotten food - took a while to realize it was the boards). So good luck washing them. And when you get them wet they warp.So until you use them and wash them they look great.
2,Pretty rough cutting boards.,"The largest board arrived cracked, and not on a glue line. This sometimes happens to wood that was not dried properly prior to cutting. Not a big deal as I can glue it. But the real disappointment was the quality of the finish. The boards are very rough finish, and lots of loose splinters hanging on from machining. The boards do not appear to have been fine sanded and have sharp corners with chipping. They are also dry as a bone and do not appear to have been oiled at all.Last week I found these same boards for sale in a major food store, and 5 of the 7 I looked at had cracks in the large board.Haven't used the boards yet as I'm not sure if I will keep them. They are inexpensive, so maybe I will glue, sand and oil them. They just get beat up from use anyway.If you are looking for a set of boards that are not a Project, look elsewhere."
3,ok,"cutting boards could be sanded better and smoother. but overall, it's what i wanted. now all i have to do is make sure my son doesn't decide to toss em in the dishwasher like he did my good ones.. lol"
3,You Get What You Pay For,I needed a cheap board or two quickly. That's what I got. Don't expect great craftsmanship. (The middle size board is a bit warped and doesn't sit flat so it sort of swivels around when I use it.)
1,Worst cutting board ever,The boards looked nice at first. But the medium size board splitted in halves after first use. The big one had a big crack on it after 5-6 uses. And I have not even used them for chopping yet. I do not recommend these board even at the sale price.
1,waste of money,"OMG, after using this for 3 days, they were all broken. I swear I will NEVER EVER use products MADE IN CHINA again! Please dont use this because the quality is EXTREMELY bad. I wish I could return all of these!"
2,wrong measurements,Item barely half inch thick NOT 1 ONE INCH-don't use clever or u have toothpicks!
2,You get what you pay,"These items are cheap, but that's about it. They are made out of slabs of wood joined together and they tend to crack open at those joining points. They also tend to warp after washing them."
3,I've had them two weeks and the mid size one has warped,"The Farberware 3 piece Wood Cutting Board Set is very low priced, but I'm not sure if they were a good deal. I'm very careful not to soak cutting boards, I wash them off and dry them. However, after about two weeks, the mid size board has warped and looks like it may soon split into three pieces. I think they came with a fairly long warranty, but I'm not sure if the shipping for replacements will be worth it. Sigh..."
3,Nice for the price,"Considering the price, it's a pretty good deal for a pack of 3. I do use all three sizes from time to time.You will have some issues with these boards. They have stray splinters, poorly-finished edges, etc. The plastic-y coating is not really what I'm looking for in a wooden cutting board, either.But, it's nothing that 20 minutes with sandpaper won't fix for you."
3,Ok,As long as these aren't your main cutting board they really aren't that bad. I would definately recommend these for serving food more than chopping.
3,They are ok!,"The product came all in one piece however there are sections that seem worn or damaged to some point, I will try to treat them since I only paid a little bit for the product but if your looking for something that will last a long time this is not a buy for you. A cheap inexpensive purchase of a wooden board makes this an ok buy any more expectations than that I would not purchase."
2,You get that for which you pay...,"If this seems like a ridiculous deal for three hardwood cutting boards, well it is. Only problem is two of the boards have split since I bought the set six months ago. I don't know if the wood is not cured correctly or what, but I have certainly not abused these cutting boards, nor have I subjected them to extreme temps or soaked them in water.If I had it to do over again, I would get one good cutting board that would last, as these will have to be replace as they continue to split.[added 4/3/07]Just wanted to update with a note that for $10 I bought a huge heavy-duty wooden cutting board at a certain Swedish superstore. Buy the mineral oil that comes with it and treat it once a year- haven't had any issues with it."
1,Don't buy this,"I read through all the reviews for this item before purchasing it. Since the positives outweigh the negatives I went for it. I have only used the big wood board three times and each time I washed it and dried it before placing it on a drying rack. Yesterday, I went to use the board and saw that it had warped and there was a huge crack running though the middle. It has been less than 3 weeks since I purchased this item and it is going straight back to Amazon. Go for the poly boards, skip the wood"
1,4 Months of use until broken,"I got these in mid-August 2006. Yesterday - December 18, 2006 - the large board split in half. It warped very quickly despite my attempts to dry it and properly store it. It was *always* hand washed too.Don't buy these."
3,It is ok for the money,Just regular wood cutting boards. It gets bowed a little bit after some time of washing and letting it dry...
2,Really not up to snuff,"One of these boards has started to crack along the line where the wooden slats are bonded together (it really doesn't hold up to any soaking/wet environment). There are a number of ""splintery"" spots. The small is too small to be practical for much. Still, the medium gets the job done (mostly).These are not especially hard boards. I would recommend either a harder wood, or just going with plastic."
5,Farberware Cutting Board Set,"Absolutely great set of cutting boards, one will always be the right size. I've used cheaper brands and they aren't as nice. I have also placed these in the dishwasher (not always - just when I've cut meat on them) and they've come out great! I would recommend these to everyone!"
3,One of the boards broke.,"The middle sized board broke after 1 week of use. The small and large ones are still holding up though. For the price, I can accept one of the boards breaking. The middle board just split clean in half, like it was glued together."
1,Poor Quality! You got what you paid for!,"I bought this cutting board set before Christmas. The biggest board is spliting after 2 weeks. You got what you paid for! I will not recommand this to anyone!update on April 4, 2006:Avoid to put these boards in Dishwasher!!! First time I put the smallest board into dishwasher. It fell apart into 3 pieces. Believe it or not, all 3 boards have fallen apart after 3 months of use!"
2,"Warning -this ""kit"" has an A series filter holder","It may not be fair to give this product the rating I have. However, I will not be able to test its function without buying new filters. It is an A-series filter holder, and many of the Cokin filters Amazon sells, including the ones I had ordered, are P-series, which are substantially larger. Nowhere on the description of this holder did I find any information indicating that it was A, rather than P. I may not have dug deeply enough, but this is significant information, and should have been included along with the info about the size of lens for which the adapter was intended, as one of the major bullet items on the main product page."
1,After 2 Years - the Sound is cutting out intermittantly like everyone elses reviews.,"This was trouble free for 2 years, now the Sound is cutting out of the Center Channel like so many have reported. Double checked all the wiring - subbed in a different center channel, it cuts out intermittantly still.Many have noted that they had to crank the volume or turn it off/on to fix. I have found that if you simply turn off the ""MCACC Auto Sound"" and switch it back on, the sound will come back.But then the Sound will cut out again later. Happens daily at this point.This will be my last Pioneer I purchase.Now I'm looking at the Onkyo TX-SR607 - it seems to get a lot of good press at an affordable price.PIONEER HAD A DESIGN FLAW with this product!!"
1,Great Until Left Channel Went Out,"This was a great, affordable and versatile receiver. I bought this to replace a GREAT Sony receiver I had owned for 8 years before the center channel started going out intermittently.Much to my dismay, after only 15 months owning this Pioneer, the front left channel on it starts going out intermittently. I checked and cleaned all hookups and it's something internal. When the channel cuts out you can tap the receiver with your finger and it comes back on for a period. Annoying! I know it's not worth fixing, so I will avoid Pioneer now. I expected this to last at least 5 years or longer.READ THE REVIEWS. I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM!"
2,"Piece of junk, right and left speakers started cutting out after 2 years.","I purchased this receiver at circuit city about 2 years ago. It was a great receiver when I first got it. Just like a brand new car, it sounded great and looked great. Recently my front left and right speakers have been cutting out randomly, I thought it was my speaker wire or my audio connection so I had all that replaced with brand new ones. To my dismay, my sound was still being cut out at random times. The only way to fix this was to turn off and turn back on the receiver or crank the volume up and back down again. This is really unacceptable as my 10 year old Sony receiver has never once broken down on me. I would stay away from this AVR if I were you, if you own this and don't have any problems lucky you. But if your like many of us with sound that cuts out, you just want to chuck this piece of crap out the window."
1,It is good only for 2 years,"Then the nasty intermittent loss-of-sound problem hit me.I was thinking it was due to loose connection, overheating/overloading, until I checked again here on Amazon. I am NOT alone...When I bought this piece of junk, the overall review was good. I bet next time I will only buy a ""mature"" model -- i.e. existing on the market over 2 years, so old customers can tell if the product can last.That is my $200 lesson.My hookup: Polk Monitor 50 x 2; Polk PSW 10; Samsung DLP 50''."
5,Love this receiver!,"Bought it at a terrific price for two reasons. First, I like the convenience of the XM. Second, the MCACC setup is brilliant for someone who does not want to get too technical but wants great performance. With this machine I get both."
1,"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!!","I would have rated less than a full star, but it wouldn't let me. I Did not receive the item I ordered! It was completely different. Tried to contact seller with NO response. Went through Amazon to get a resolution & apparently seller didn't respond to them either because Amazon just notified me that they would issue me a refund for my purchase. This was a Christmas gift, which I was embarrassed to find that it was the wrong item. It said #8 Dale JR, but they sent #3 Dale SR. Terrible customer service!!! Would NOT recommend ordering from them. UNresponsive."
5,CD Gospel Review,Arrived timely and in excellent condition! Am enjoying it! WOuld order from them again.--A. Walton
2,Spiritless performance,"When Monteverdi used to present himself to the Venetian Doge, this public functionary used to knee himself before il signore e maestro Claudio Monteverdi. From this Michel Corboz's interpretation one can hardly imagine why the Doge behaved so: a spiritless, motionless, expressionless performance, which cannot inspire a minimal sense of awe, that one which the Venetian Doge was so very well acquainted at."
2,"Simple, short, and a little boring.","I didn't like this book very much for my toddler. It was too simple and read more like an exercise book kids get from school for homework to practice learning how to read. It's a good book for early readers. I wouldn't spend this much on a book like that, there are similar books for $.99 that do the same job. I guess you are paying for the Spot character and the fact that it's a board book. It is extremely tiny in size, smaller than normal mini board books."
4,Short and sweet,"Really small simple book, but very cute. My twelve month old daughter loves it and can easily hold it and turn pages. There are no flaps, but she still likes it. That is saying something."
4,Short and Sweet,"Really adorable, sweet and short book for under 12 months. Use this when you are introducing books. It is vivid and talks about spot the dog's bedtime routine. My daughter loves dogs and it is small enough to carry in a diaper bag. I just think it is a little pricey for such a tiny book. But overall good content. The book is now worn out and my daughter 3 months shy from turning 2 has turn the last page of this board book out. O well, it was thoroughly enjoyed while it lasted."
4,It's really cute,"It's a bit too short, but I like the small size and the story as it's very similar to our own bedtime routine. :)"
3,This book is tiny,"In the search for more ""Spot"" books, I came across this one, and thought it'd be a nice little book to read to my toddler before bed. ""Little"" is right! This book fits in (practically) the palm of my hand, and the story is the same as all ""night-night"" books; play the day away, take a bath, pick a book, go to sleep. I guess I thought it'd be a lift-the-flap book (but that's my fault for not reading the product description correctly). It's okay...it hasn't gotten rave reviews from my dog-loving bookworm of a toddler either."
5,Ausgezeichneter Film,"well acted . I became totally absorbed by the less-than-likely scenario and chuckled and laughed through most of the film.. As cameron mannheim stated at the Emmys, ""This one is for the fat girls !"". grab some buttered popcorn and curl up on the divan."
5,"Great delivery and packaging, perfect condition","Sorry for the delay in writing this review, but I bought the film for a friend and had to wait to have it transferred to DVD before I could say for sure. She was thrilled with it, and the seller did a great job of shipping promptly.Thanks So Much,Liz"
5,Developmental and Functional Hand Grasps,"""Developmental & Functional Hand Grasps"" is the most valuable book on this topic published in recent years. First, it has certainly met the objectives stated in the introduction. I found it to be an exciting but easy read, with logical organization, comprehensive inclusion of theoretical approaches, and exactly the right kinds of photos and drawings. How great that the photos gave examples of so many different Activities of Daily Living, common in our lives, but seldom depicted. I especially enjoyed the Descriptions, Interesting Information, and Functional Uses. The presentation of the hand from physiological, developmental, and functional perspectives has not been done as fully but simply by other authors. Finally, the book will be useful as an important resource to students, clinicians, and researchers alike."
4,Functional hand grasps,This is a very detailed book and is good except that it would be nice if it showed cause and effect of some abnormal hand functions. It strictly pertains to normal function.
2,"Just be aware, 2G is NOT 2GB","This is a nice enough product, but it is for a second generation shuffle which is not even sold any more. If you were to order the Package deal with the puck, the Ipod, and the arm band, the shuffle you would get (4th generation, look at the picture) would not fit the holder in the puck you would get with it. Mea Culpa for not checking more closely but there are so few products out there for my shuffle that I leapt before I looked. If you DO have an older Ipod shuffle 2G (not 2GB, 4th Gen) this will probably work fine for you , just be aware and avoid the return hassle. (to be fair it wasn't much of a hassle. The folks at 1to3shop were helpful)"
2,Unnecessarily small - bulky zipper,"The rigid case does keep my 2G Shuffle secure, but the earbuds have to be wound too tightly in order to fit inside the case - wind them loosely and they spring outside and in the way of the large and bulky zipper. Earphone wires should never be wound tightly, as every pamphlet will caution. The case does not need such a large zipper - well placed velcro would have worked better. I have to keep pushing my earbud wires inside the case constantly as I zip the case and I have to unzip very carefully so as not to scrape the zipper across the wires. If this case had been made only half an inch wider in diameter, these problems would be solved."
5,a great case for the shuffle 2nd gen. Mp3,"I wanted a hard case for my shuffle, so I could take it everywhere and not have to worry about anything damaging both my Mp3 and earbuds. Plus, I was tired of unwinding the earbuds everytime I wanted to listen to music. The shuffle fits snugly in the middle, and the earbuds can be wrapped around the inner braces. Also, I don't have to worry about leaving it somewhere, because it clips right on to my belt loop. Safe, secure, and well made. I ended up buying three of them for my family members! I recommend this product for any shuffle 2nd gen. owners."
5,Great iPod accessory,"I bought a Shuffle to take to the gym. I always got a little worried about the Shuffle getting knocked around being in the bag with my lock, keys, etc. This case is great for carrying the Shuffle and a set of headpones around."
3,I pod shuffle carry case.,The product doesn't really allow the I pod shuffle to fit as securely inside as I thought it would Is functional and can be used..
2,NOT FOR THE NEWEST SHUFFLE,"Despite the fact that Amazon offers this as a suggested add on for the 6th generation iPod shuffle (newest model) it does not fit. The newest ipod is slightly smaller (between 1/4 to a 1/3 inch) and does not snap into the holder. Because of this, the case is useless the iPod just flops around inside. It is a shame. It is a nice looking, sturdy case.I do want to say that I contacted the seller and they did respond quickly and offer me a choice of a 30% refund and keep the product or I can return it for a full refund."
3,"Good, but color is different than picture","These are as cute as can be, but the picture makes them look blue and yellow, when they are really closer to orange and green."
5,Excellent,I find this stool to be excellent. The shipping took a long time (Almost 2 weeks) but the product itself is excellent. It is very well put together and the perfect size for a regular sofa.
5,Excellent Purchase!,"I am so thrilled with the purchase of this saw. I never would have thought that I would be ordering a saw from Amazon.com! But I have built up such a trust with them with many book purchases that I decided to take the chance!This saw has everything I need at a price I could afford. I researched for several weeks before making this purchase. In the past with the older saws that I have it would take anywhere from 2-5 min, or longer if something went amiss to reset for each setup for fretwork, with this saw it takes a mere few seconds. This saw is heaven !!"
3,"Inspiring player, poor teacher",I had high hopes for this Hot Licks video (1 of 10). Mick was with the Stones during my favorite period of their long career. His playing on Mayall's 70 birthday concert dvd was the highlight. Mick is one of those great players who can't explain what he's doing even when Arlen steps in to try and draw it out of him. Mick really shines in the slide portions being equally adept with standard tuning as he is with open tuning. I found the portions before the slide section lacking in freshness of ideas. I would buy this again because Mick's performances are inspiring and a joy to see and hear closeup.
1,Flavorless.,"Ghost Hunt reads like an episode of Scooby-Doo, except the main male-character ""ghost buster"" does not out-and-out deny existence of paranormal-- he simply disproves the paranormal is at work.The gist of the plot: The story is told from the point of view of a stupid school girl who becomes Mr. Science's helper (not his actual name). Mr. Science is a pretty boy who shows up to a supposedly 'haunted' school with his high-tech equipment. The principal would like to demolish the old building but cannot because of a plague of weird 'accidents' surrounding the site. After one day of Mr. Science, the principal invites a medium, a miko, and a Catholic priest to help solve the problem. These people do not get along. Of course, Mr. Science solves the case.The story is not particularly interesting, nor original. The main female-character is annoying. The book ends with her becoming Mr. Science's employee for sequels. *yawn*"
4,"Very useful, great quality","I ordered this screen protector because I had recently purchased the RIZR, and I didn't like the dirt and fingerprints that kept getting the screen dirty. This is a great product that does its job well. It was a little tricky to install, but after a few attempts it went on perfectly, without air bubbles. Once it is on, you barely notice its there. I would recommend this product."
4,Great product,"Just purchased this product for 4 phones. One needs a lot of care and agility to install it properly. Once in place it looks very good and protects the screen well-so it serves the purpose.. I have so far put it on 2 phones, 1 was OK -from the first time- except an unremovable bubble under the bar that pushes the phone up. With the second one I was not as lucky, it did not fit properly from the first time, I had to try to re-install it and it ended up with lint under the protecting screen and of course the same bubble as above, and a spot in the upper corner that would not stick. All these mishaps around the corners don't show however if you add a snap-on cover to the phone. Overall, I highly recommend this product. I still need a lot of luck with our next 2 phones. Shipping was very efficient and fast but definitely too expensive, we paid around $16 shipping for something as light as a postcard!!"
1,Tore up after a week...,"Don't waste your money on this. I don't abuse my cell phone, so when this cover started to rip at the seams within a week of putting it on my phone I was completely disappointed. You get what you pay for..."
5,Heart opening,Journey Into Love is one of the best recordings I have heard. Listening to it opens my heart as few things do. I use it in my workshops. This music is for those on a devotional path.
5,a great book!,I first read this book when I was in Kindergarten. My teacher then was Gita Kaufman and the main character in the book was one of her students. It is a great story for a young child to read about the misfortunes of a fellow child and how that child still find love and happiness in his life. I would recommend this book three times over!
3,Parker ? Foxy ? TB is going downhill !,Ok first off. This book was ok. Not great not horrible. If you like a good read about Parker than go ahead. Give this book a try. If you are a loyal TB reader then I would say read this book and be very dissapointed. Parker gets a new horse - which Ihappen to like alot. He still has Foxy but what's up with Foxy...? I mean come on writers !...Argggg...... Ok Parker has been a great character from the beginning - well at least I liked him. This book makes parker almost look bad. What has happened to funny never cares about a thing Parker!...Double Humph. All I have to say is that this book series ended at about book 24. I want the old charcters and the old series back.
1,Going Downhill,"I'm sorry, but I remember when the first Thoroughbred book came out. I bought the next three right away and I continued to buy future ones. However, right away I started to get discouraged by the time gap these books have. I am not very thrilled with the idea that the horses and people that I loved in the early books barely mean anything anymore. I miss the older books, they just keep getting farther and farther out of touch."
3,"A good book, but...","Well...I can't say it was a BAD book, because it wasn't. Although I do have to say, the synopsis on the back didn't really have much to do with the book, they didn't mention anything about being a ""team player"" really. I enjoyed reading about Parker's quest for a second horse, and his needing money. So he is human after all! I was, however, enraged by the cliff-hanger ending, very annoying. All in all, it was a good book, although I must ask, where had Image gone? What is going to happen in the Derby? So far it seems it will be Star, Image, Celtic Mist, Rush Street, and Gratis...who else? TIme never seems to move forward in these books!"
2,Going down the track to boredom,"Let me see--Parker, the perfect child. Whoa, suddenly he needs money? GASP! Oh no! So he gets a horse, which should be left out, he deserves the break. Foxy is almost killed, what happened to Parker like promising never to hurt her way back when he first got her and hurt he? Well?Parker, you're a horrible character.Will someone get the facts right please? We can write better then these writers. C'mon guys!"
5,awakens the mind,"The first time I watched this movie it sent my mind for a loop. I spent months thinking just about the message and the meaning behind the message that ws displayed at the end of the movie. The entire movie teaches another way of looking at life on our planet. You must open your mind in order to understand. I have watched this movie over a dozen times and would still watch it again. I do not own my own copy, but the video rental place does. A movie with a message of hope. I give it my up most award."
4,"Great deal, so handy","Very glad we now have a variety of dishwasher-able cutting boards! Not too big so they don't fit in, not so small that they're hard to use."
4,Nice set,"This is a nice set- it's nice to have a smaller cutting board that isn't wood. My only qualm is that I wish there was one more, much larger cutting board included in this set."
5,Quality cutting boards,"These cutting boards make a great set. Seem durable, easy to clean and dishwasher safe, good sizes to work with (so easy to store), and a great bargain."
4,Great Deal,"Obviously there are much better cutting boards out there, but for the money you can not beat this deal. Three cutting boards for [the price]! The only downside is they will take awhile to arrive, but once they do you will find them to be well worth the money. The boards seem to be pretty durable and the sizes are a logical match for most kitchen work."
4,Great Buy!,"My old poly boards looked pretty bad - stained and scarred - and very difficult to clean because of all the cuts in the surface. So when I saw these for $10 I figured I'd start over with nice looking ones. After a few uses they don't show any knife cuts and no tomato stains - I'm happy! I wish all the boards had the side grooves for juices like the paddle board does, but, for the price, I can't complain. I priced poly boards in the stores and can't match these. I will probabaly look for more types and sizes by this manufacturer."
3,"Not great, but gets the job done","I use these boards a lot and while they get the job done, I do wish they were a bit thicker and heavier. The price is right, however."
3,"So, So Set","These are ok. The boards are think enough, but stain very easily. The three sizes are nice, especially the small one. For the price, these are worth it."
4,just fine,"Not much to say.They're cutting boards, reasonably priced, they work and the delivery was up to the standards I've come to expect from Amazon."
5,A great deal,"I got this set when my original Faberware one was melted (don't ask!) and I only planned to keep the one. They are made of heavy, quality Poly and it seems that I have developed a need for all 3."
1,Poly not so jolly,"This 3-piece set has only one usable piece, that being the largest -- the 2 other pieces are too small and move around. I wanted a medium weight, smaller piece due to my counter space, and that worked well. However, the board has deep and unattractive cuts from dicing vegies and cutting meat. I worry about getting it clean from bacteria. I have used it only and short while and I feel that's about how long it's going to last."
5,worth the price,"I realize that these are inexpensive cutting boards & aren't even entirely flat, but for the price they're absolutely worth it."
4,great price and quality,NICE...very nice...easy to use...doesn't destroy the edge on my knife...cleaning is a breeze...what's not to like.
2,poly want a new board?,"THE BOARDS ARE LOUSY. BOUNCY, DO NOT SIT WELL ON COUNTER WITHOUT A CLOTH BASE. NO BIG DEAL. THEY ARE NOT AT ALL RESISTANT TO KNIFE MARKS, THEREFORE THEY ARE ALL STREAKED WITH STAIN IN THE KNIFE CRACKS. MUST USE BLEACH. NOT EXPENSIVE SO I GUESS I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND , THOUGH."
4,Quality cutting boards,These plastic cutting boards are sturdy and simple. Three is the exact perfect number if you do medium-complex dishes and the sizing is just what I need.
2,Disappointing quality.,"This is a good, very useful type of cutting board. The sizes provided are handy. However, in the set I received, the largest board was substantially defective: the color is irregular in places, and the thickness in inconsistent. The board is thicker near the edges than it is in the middle, which is a serious flaw since the knife needs to contact the board throughout the cut.I've owned several cutting boards, and never had one with a defect. It's an extremely simple product, and almost all types are flawless. To receive one with two separate, easily noticeable flaws is very disappointing. I cannot recommend this product."
3,Not perfectly flat,"I bought two sets of these. They're great for smashing wet things like handmade paper and pasted items. But both of the largest boards were warped--tippy on one side and stable but not flush with the table on the other. Still, for the money I'm very happy with the small boards which *are* perfectly flat."
2,Cheap but poor quality...,"I agree with some earlier reviews: These boards have uneven thicknesses, and the cutting surface is not flat. This means the boards can wobble on the countertop. Farberware may be inexpensive, but it's no bargain. Spend the extra dollars on a KitchenAid cutting board, which is thick, perfectly flat, and has non-skid rubber grips. If you're on a budget, Ikea cutting boards are even cheaper than Farberware but still better."
5,Save Your Expensive Knives! Use These!,"This is a pretty good set of cutting boards. You're not going to carve a large turkey on any of them but all three are of a useful size for everyday use. The Poly boards are easy on expensive knives. I use a folded, slightly damp kitchen towel under all my cutting boards to keep them from sliding around. An economical set of good quality."
3,Don't expect high quality...,"These are usable, but this is not a great set of boards. The plastic is fully opaque (not the tougher slightly-translucent plastic you see in some boards). They are very thin, and have some minor manufacturing defects (not completely flat, there are bits of plastic still on the seams where they came out of the mold, a few odd gouges probably also from the manufacturing process).On the plus side, the three sizes are handy - the large is useful without being unwieldy, the small is just right for little jobs, and the medium is a good all-purpose size - and you're not going to beat the price (particularly as part of an order with Amazon's Super Saver shipping). For quality they'd get two stars; the extra star is for good value for the money."
2,left behind slice-marks,"i used it twice and it left small slice marks after the first use-cutting onions(i used a small sharp cutting knife). It looks like it's been used more than the two times i used it. If slice marks don't bother you, then it's worth $15 dollars. Personally, I wish I would have gotten something of higher quality that wouldn't leave slice marks in the cutting board."
2,Not worth $15,"These cutting boards are not very nice. I expect a plastic cutting board to have some ""give"" so that it doesn't damage my knives, but these boards are pretty rigid."
3,Good but flawed,In general I like the set but the biggest board in the group came warped. Ok if you have it resting one way but put it the other and it makes a great lazy Susan.
1,cheap quality,"These boards are horrible. Warped, bad color, would not use my 99 jc penny knife on these much less my Henckles. Total utter garbage, do not waste your money on these."
4,Good but not great!,As previously mentioned these boards stain extremely easily and you notice cuts and marring very quickly. But overall a good set for the price.
2,"Hmmm... much is missing, and the format is strange.","This was not the Voyage of the Beagle I read in college. It was heavily edited to be more of a 1800's travelogue. Even though this was a free offering I was still expecting the entire Voyage of the Beagle. Slightly disappointed.Perhaps if you wanted to show a youngster something of what it was like to travel around in the days of yore, this might have some value. If you are looking for a quality edited record of the Voyage of the Beagle then look farther afield."
1,The Voyage of the Beagle,"Title: The Voyage of the Beagle.This a reprint without maps or pictures, very disappointing. I should have been more careful in purchasing it. Now I will have to get another."
4,Beagle Voyage a good read!,"I enjoyed reading Darwin's account of his observations of the countries and islands visited by the HMS Beagle from 1831-1836. This free version contains no illustrations, so I printed several maps of the areas Darwin described for reference. For example, the Galapagos islands Darwin visited in 1835 have different names today (i.e. James is now Santiago; Indefatigable is now Santa Cruz)."
3,A duty to read,"This is a book I have always felt I should read. It did not disappoint however it requires reader to have a certain scientific background or understanding. Darwin limits his descriptions of the actual time on board, hardships etc but most of the narrative is about his on shore treks. I am certainly glad I read this"
1,"Penguin Version is abridged, with no warning on the cover","The 1 star is for Penguin, because the cover does not warn you that the content has been sharply abridged. Darwin's thinking and writing are wonderful -- but grossly and unfairly cut to ribbons."
3,Print too small,"I was very disappointed that the print size of the text is so small. It appears to be a reduced typed copy with a nice cover. The information in the text is very interesting, but the size of the text makes it a stuggle. I would buy a different edition next time."
4,A book you can't put down!,Wanda Thomas writes a delightful tale of a strong woman won over by a strong man. Ms. Thomas entices you to keep turning the pages with her gripping suspense and romantic flair. A must read for the romantic!
4,Family Celebrations,"The product is as advertised. It arrived in due time. The contents covered most occasions, but not the one I needed, which was a jubilee celebration for women religious; however, I was able to ""drop back and punt."""
3,The Hearse,"Very ""short"" short story. So my review will be very short.Only for die hard Laymon fans. Story is not accurate in regards to the ""repo"" business. Still a Laymon short story is always a welcome sight for the true horror fan."
1,What a ripoff,"For $8 I expected this would be a real paperback. Imagine my surprise when I find it's a lousy 20 page piece of trash like somebody made with a photocopier. If Laymon was still alive I would say For Shame but I guess his estate is hard up, if they are selling underhanded crap like this. Save your money!"
1,Shame on Amazon for selling this rip off..!,"This is not a paperback. It's a phamplet. At first I thought it was an advertisement for the book and was flabbergasted to find out it was the book. Book? Not hardly. Just 27 mini pages?! Give me a break. To make matters worse, it's not even a very good story.What are you going to sell next... Eight-paged Bibles..? (If you are too young to know what those are, ask your grandpaw.)"
2,textbook juvenile spooky story,"This story was predictable and lacked the punch that Laymon typically delivers. The Hearse is a ""sanitized"" story crafted in the style of an Edgar Allan Poe tale published in middle school textbooks. For the price I expected a lot more."
1,This is a fastback! Ouch!,"Oh! I love Laymon, but when your used to a page turner like Island this doesnt fulfill the need. BUT on the flipside-cute little collectors item......"
4,"Elihu Root--A Man of, and Ahead of, His Time","Elihu Root was a prolific statesman with a prodigious intellect, and the addresses and speeches contained in this book are full of elegant language and remarkable insights. They are written in a manner that is accessible to readers of high school age or older. The arguments and observations Mr. Root makes are clear-eyed and conciliatory, and they are as applicable in today's geopolitical environment as they were 100 years ago. His arguments are also distinct from those posed by most contemporary pundits and politicians insofar as Mr. Root is willing to consider both sides and seek middle ground. In reading other source material about Mr. Root, it is clear that he was an extremely focused, fairly self-effacing social servant. He was also devoid of self-promotional tendencies. I suspect that is why he isn't mentioned more prominently in discussions about 20th century American diplomacy. He needed a better press secretary."
4,using pattern blocks,This is a very helpful book for my 5 year old. He uses this as part of our math program. It teaches logical thinking and spatial skills. He even used the idea and created animals of his own using the pattern blocks!
5,Good source of ideas and info,"This is a good source of information for businesses who are starting because it helps explain how to utilize a spokesperson, colors and advertising it even gives you examples. In order to explain the point about ads it gives you advertisements from various companies on what to do and not to do as examples. I would recomend this book for many reasons but I believe you have to read it to understand why it is so good for anyone starting or even in an existing business to use."
3,S&S,"Short and simple and to the point. I liked this book because it was light reading and was interesting enough to keep my attention and I learned some things I didn't know, so that is always good."
3,A Marketing 101 Review,"The information in this book is hardly revolutionary. However, ""Steal These Ideas,"" serves as a solid introduction or refresher course concerning marketing methods. Cone is easy to read and makes his points quickly, which is a blessing."
5,Stealing Some Great Ideas,"Steve Cone has written one of the best marketing books since the prolific writing team of Ries and Trout. It is a must read for anyone in the marketing field today. If there was a marketing book hall of fame, I'd immediately nominate this book for admission. I spent almost 38 years in financial services marketing and wish I had this book back in the early 1970s. I have already used it a few times for articles in my online marketing newsletter. I'm on my second reading."
5,Rack works fine,"We bought this rack to hang our new tiller. It is very sturdy, it mounted on the wall easily and has plenty of room for any additional items you buy for the tiller. We were glad to be able to hang the tiller securely, off of the floor and out of the way. We needed to save any floor space that we could in the garage."
3,Dennis,Great Tool in the Garden but Hard to start. Once you have it running it can't be beat but as said before hard to start
5,"great tool, fast shipped","I am a dewalt tool freak, and just added this tool to my collection. great tool and was also fast shipped. manny thanks to amazon"
5,"Expensive, but the BEST available today","Alas, Permacel no longer makes gaffer's tape. If I had realized sooner, I would have bought a lifetime supply while I still could.I've read that Shurtape is pretty much just re-branded Permacel, but I think it is not quite as good. But it is still (much) better than anything out there now. After Permacel quit, I tried several brands to find a replacement. Most of them should not even be called gaff tape!!! Gaff tape is a mystical thing - it stands up well to sunlight and water. It sticks to practically anything (including slippery plastics). It can be in place for years and not leave residue when removed. Shurtape carries on this mystical legacy.Spend the money and get the best."
5,Beginner Coaches -- Buy this one!!!,This book is great for girl coaches from new to experienced. It is for the coach who wants to learn how to coach basketball the right way. I am a coach and have three daughters and I would hope that any coach that teaches any of my children would have at least a working knowledge of the information in this book. It is an easy read and a good reference book.
4,A fine piece of work,"Unlike the simple minded Braveheart, Rob Roy does not relentlessly flog the fashionable anti-english message and is a more stirring, intelligent (although that would not be difficult)and better produced affair. of course the english are the baddies , but the wonderful performances from Tim Roth and John Hurt as the horrible english tyrants are in stark contrast with the slightly worthy but dull Rob Roy. Beautifully photographed and well paced. Recommended"
4,nice,"on off switch not the most conveniently located switch, the white is a paper like film, but it does look nice. Made in China."
3,Story? What Story?,"The premise to the story sounds interesting, and the pairing of Arkin and Sheen had promise, but for me this film falls flat, though the ending is touching. It has a good message but is just a little too cliched and the acting is a little too flat. Plus, there is the suggestion of some humor in the telling, but I couldnt really see any, it seems to me as stultified as any of the conventional takes on 'The Greatest Story Ever Told'."
4,A Christmas Favorite,"Little known story of the Fourth Wise Man. Elder Sheen does a good job, but Arkin steals the show with his complaining. Great Christmas video!"
4,Suitable Easter video,"My wife and I enjoyed this film as very suitable viewing in Easter time. The producers could have kept more to the original text though. Still, the essence was there."
3,The Fourth Wise Man,The quality of the picture I thought would have been better. The movie is one of my favorites and wanted it in my DVD library.
3,A bit disappointing,"We were trying to find the version that aired on television during the 1950s and 1960s. This wasn't it. It was a good movie, just not what we were expecting."
4,A Christmas Classic,"The Fourth Wise Man deserves to be a Christmas classic. Martin Sheen's portrayal of the Magi, Ataban, is touching and Alan Arkin's humorous bits give the story lightness to balance the on going tragedy of the quest. If the true meaning of being a Christian is important to you don't miss this wonderful story."
2,dated -,only show to persons junior high and under - actually this may only be suitable for children... good message but a little boring and predictable.
3,Aaahhh... I could have done without it....,"I gave this movie a 3-star rating. I did not, not like it. The acting was good. The plot was ok. The idea was worth while. The movie had no bones...until the end...(I won't give the last few scenes away in case someone else views the whole thing through like my wife and I did.Martin Sheen is usually a great actor. But he just couldn't carry off this roll. I don't think he believed enough of what he tried to portray. The movie finally did it in the last scenes.So, if you want the heart and soul of this movie; watch the first 5 or 10 minutes to set up the plot, then the last 30 to 60 seconds to get the meat."
2,4th wiseman dvd,i love the story but the picture looks like it was copied from a very old vhs tape; blury and faded. it made me think it might have been a pirated copy!
2,the character PAUL,"Paul was a Roman citizen and died at the behest of Nero -- A Roman execution of a Roman is by ""beheading""Whoever wrote that Paul was sent to the Cross obviouly doesn't know the Bible."
4,The fourth wise man,Hermosa pel√≠cula para disfrutar en familia. Ense√±a valores morales y cristianos. El DVD es de excelente calidad y los actores de primera categoria. Es una de esas historias que nunca pasan de moda.
4,B+ but a family favorite,"Checked this out from the public library then decided to buy it for ourselves. Will become a must-see every Christmas season for our family. Martin Sheen and Alan Arkin, of course, are excellent (though very young!). Overall production value is B to B+. Though the ending is somewhat predictable, it is still very touching. It's fun to see both Martin and Alan's sons in cameo appearances as well as other famous actors/actresses from yore. Alan Arkin plays a great comedic part to Martin Sheen's earnest searcher. My kids (16 and 13) and I crack up every time Sheen challenges Arkin ""Are you not covered in shame?""Although a Christmas movie, the time span covers 30+ years including the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ."
4,SEARCHING FOR JESUS IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES,this is a film that should be a modern day classic. i can not tell this story to friends without crying as this movie did touch me that much so long ago. the theme is timeless and a gospel truth. i wholeheartedly recommend this film and can't wait to get it to see it again its been way too long since i have seen it. i feel this would be an excellent film for the whole family as it brings forth the true meaning of charity and sacrifice and all done from a heart that is searching for GOD. young and old will enjoy and be challenged by this film. it is just a beautiful story. GOD bless ad enjoy jb
4,Out of the woodwork,"This obscure DVD, although not well know is one of the best movies made. It captures your attention, and then uses that to help you see what life is all about. For anyone who has ever had a dream, or has ever wanted more from his or her life, this movie will move you inside and give you hope. Martin Sheen does a terrific job at telling this captivating story. With little violence and no language it comes to you as an experience the whole family can enjoy."
4,WOW!,"FIRST HEARD THIS IN SMART BELLS CLASS - GREAT EXERCISE, GREAT CLASS - AND WE WERE ALL LIKE COOLING DOWN TIL THIS CAME ON - THEN LOTSA HOT DANCING TO THE MUSIC.THE COVER SAYS IT ALL : BRENT LEWIS & HIS MUSICIANS BRING YOU THEIR FIRE !HOWEVER, WHEN I WENT TO RIP IT TO MY MUSIC LIBRARY, NONE OF THE SONGS NAMES WERE THE SAME AS ON THE CD JACKET..."
3,drum cd,"Not really what I was looking forward to. This cd is nice, but seems to be repetitive. Each tune is similar, there is no different mood. No clue what the title is supposed to mean. I expected a more artistic cd, somthing with soul and feeling. I was a little dissapointed."
2,not very good,"A simple basic flashlight which failed in the first month after rolling off a shoebox onto a desktop, maybe 4-6 inches. I was especially surprised given the sturdy looking case. Straight to trash and replaced by an LED light for less money...far brighter too."
3,seems to be a fine product but not good for my use,The composition of this item is good for it's intended purpose but can give off a slight odor.
2,Arthritis glove,"I got this for my wife for Xmas two years ago. She never uses it. Too bulky, uncomfortable and hot."
4,Arthritis help,Saw these gloves on Dr. Oz. Ordered them because I have painful arthritis in my right hand. They certainly do help my hand feel better
5,Great gloves!,"I bought these as a gift. The person absolutely loves them.He is also a soccer referree, and can use them in cold weather."
4,Nice except for the initial smell.,Keeps your hands warm while adding light compression on your joints. Nice to wear to bed at night. Only negative is that there is a bad odor when first purchased. I had to air them for a few weeks before I could wear.
4,Home Audio Level,"For a crossover that had minimal reviews and majority being negative I took a risk on getting this model. I'm glad I did. For a small set up in a dorm room that will grow next year, it does perfect job of separating my lows and highs."
2,Worked good until,I liked it until after a year one one channel stopped working. I took it apart and one of the input RCA inputs had gotten hot. Not sure why that happened
1,Terrible product,Smelled like it just came off the assembly line when I opened the box. Neither of the two I got worked for more than ten minutes. Piece of junk.
1,Do Not Buy This Product,"I repeat, do not buy this product, or any product from this company.I purchased this crossover and received a dead unit, ordered a next one to arrive the next day, and it too is dead on arrival. I now have to dead crossovers to return, and I am very annoyed. On top of that, I tried calling Pyramid and was greeted by a message saying their offices are now closed. It is 1 PM Eastern Time on a Friday and your manual says you are open till 2 PM Eastern Time.Avoid this product and any products from this company."
5,A great documentary.,"This was a great documentary. The section on Reagan was superb. I could have done w/o slick Willie's comments on Johnson however. Nevertheless, it is a wonderfully in depth look at three very different yet intriguing presidents. Morgan Freeman is an excellent commentator."
5,Great CD and Poster!,"Amazing. These guys have the knack for not releasing good songs. Even so, My Generation is a good song, and the poster is great! Extreme close-up! LB has done it again."
2,Not impressed,"I really thought this saw would be better than the $5.00 folding saws H F used to sell, but it`snot."
2,Really one entertainment center you can make in 24 sizes,"A basic center/2 sides cabinet is the only model covered in this book. The rest is exploded orthographic CAD drawings and plywood cutting plans for several different size combinations.This book would be useful for novices who want to build this particular cabinet, but even for them it does not offer step by step instructions or photos. If you're looking for a variety in projects and styles, keep looking."
3,Functional.,Purse hook is functional. But you get what you pay for... this one looks great in the picture but looks cheap in person. The gold is much more brassy and bright than it looks in the picture. Nice idea.. poor execution.
3,Purse Hanger,"I love the purse hanger---great little invention. However,I could have gotten one that is like a coin & opens up forthe same price. This is pretty & works well."
2,Misleading photo,"I found that the actual product did not look like the image shown. It's not really ""green floral"". There's a tinge of mint green, but it's mostly gold, red and yellow. I'm sure it works fine, but didn't look like I expected it to."
4,Purse Hanger,Works for intended purpose and gets a lot of comments. At home keeps the purse off a chair or from hanging around a doorknob
4,Like it.,It works but my purse is so big that it is tricky to get the hook situated. But that is my fault.
4,Good for small kids,It was good for my sisters son! He had fun with his parents whilieng learning! It is small though.....
1,Wrong battery for the DC330 camcorder,"The Amazon Technical spec is wrong.Compatible with: DC10/DC20/DC22/DC40/DC50/DC100/DC210/DC220/DC230/DC310/DC320/DC330The battery included doesn't work with theCanon DC330 1.07MP DVD Camcorder with 48x Optical Zoomor I suspect the DC320.As I needed this bag to give with the DC330 camcorder as a gift, I hoped to be able to return just the battery, which amazon wouldn't allow. Now I'm out of pocket and without a spare battery."
3,ah,"well i dont know what to say, i know they are very small and should not expect alot. So as far as size goes i think there pretty good, or really good. I have not delt with this size before so i dont have anything to compare them to."
5,Infinity Kappa,"Many people say that the infinity kappa products produce great highs and mediocre lows. This does hold true. If you have a subwoofer, these speakers balance that out perfectly! Even off headunit power alone, a pair of these are louder than any 4 ohm speaker off the same power. Gotta love the 2 ohm!"
2,Did not fit my jeep,I ordered these for my 2001 Jeep Wrangler and they did not fit. I had to McGiver brackets to put them in.Amazon said they would fit?
1,Very Poor Book,"This is a truly terrible book. The author seems to be trying to capitalize on his good name and seeking a wider audience for his spiritual messages by encapsulating them in the form of a novel. There is nothing wrong with the spiritual messages the author attempts to communicate in this book. There is very much wrong with the execution. The plot is muddled, the writing is disjointed, and the ending is disappointing to say the least.I would suggest that people wanting to hear Mr. Chopra's message get it from one of his more scholarly books rather than from this very poor popularization.This is one of the very few books I have ever read that I have thrown immediately into the trash after finishing it rather than putting it back on my shelf or passing it on to someone else.Save your money and pass this one up.Joe Leben"
1,"This is a novel, not like his other books","And I positively disliked it! It is a poorly written 'action' novel interrupted at 4 or 5 places by one page 'voice of the angel' sections which are the only parts that remotely resemble Deepak's previous writings. I magine that the 'novel' part was written by his co-author. I was repelled by this book, and ended up returning it to Amazon. Normally I am a big fan of his and own most of his previous books.Is this a new direction for Deepak? Is he trying to reach people who read junk novels? Or the 'angel' people? If so this is NOT good enough. Deepak, please stick to what you do best.."
3,Interesting,"I found this to be ab interesting and thgouht-provoking book, although obscure at times. Well worth your time."
5,sliding door cabinet review,"the assembly took approximately 4 hrs over a 2 day period. pay closeattention to the horizontal boards in the rear of cabinet, insure thatthe mounting screw holes are facing outward. also pay close attention to the wood assembly screws and the specific lengths required. the assemblywas not difficult at all."
3,Strength Training for Women,"Initially, I thought this book was going to be very good. I am a personal trainer and I am always looking for new ideas and perspectives. I think that there is alot of good general information in this book, especially for the general public. The exercises and workout programs are also good for most people, although I doubt most people are looking for a competitive level exercise program. However, I think that someone who is looking for something new or innovative to add to their workout routine is going to be disappointed."
2,Boring,"If you are at the gym , and you are working out , you are tapping into your physical energy . The last thing you want to do is read words and words . You need more pictures on how . This book has just too much of words"
2,"inspiring models, please?","the thing that i most disliked about the book is the pictures. the models are not pretty, not inspiring, look like they have a body fat percentage over 25, etc. if you like to see exercises demonstrated by people who are actually in shape, you probably will not like this book.on the other hand, there is some fairly in-depth discussion in here, and almost all the exercises can easily be done at home. they are nothing new, but if you are a beginner who wants to learn but does not want to join a gym, this is the book for you."
5,Progressive Space Music With A Beat...,"This is another progressive experience by Jim Pietkivitch. The music contained on this album is of instrumental compositions originating in the progressive electronic and ambient forms.Twilight Dreams explores a different style in the genre, opening with spacey ambient, progressing to lively and rhythmic sounding. Pietkivitch proves yet again that it isn't the equipment that empowers the mind, but the ability and imagination.Quite simply a must-have disc this!"
4,Good deal land quick shipment,The item was delivered quickly and the batteries were very fresh. I've gotten batteries from other places that were very old and did not last long. This is not the case with this seller.
4,A very thorough book.,"For stat lovers, this is a must. Gives stats on all players plus prospects. Also year end league leading stats. They could improve on a few things - like showing a players slugging average and on-base average, which are much more important than showing how many times a guy turned a double play in the minors."
5,"Vaya, Vaya, Que Dicha! Pimsleur para Ingl√©s",Al fin encontr√© el primer nivel completo del m√©todo Pimsleur para aprender el ingl√©s que le voy a regalar a mi esposa. Estoy seguro de eso porque ya conozco el m√©todo Pimsleur y s√© que es bueno y efectivo.
4,"Very interesting, just wish it had a little more detail","Very informative little book, I learned a lot that I needed toknow but I wish that it could've had just a little more detail (butfor the price I can't complain). Now if a few Celtic coins would just show up on Amazon's auction site."
1,A remade book,"I purchased this book to study for the SAT exam and I found that when I compared it to my friends book by Gruenbaum ""SAT Inside Out"" that my book is nothing but the old book with a different cover. What a rip-off!! This is like what textbook publishers do by re-arranging the chapters in a text and putting it out as a ""new"" edition! If you have the old book DO NOT buy this new one!! You have it now. A classic deception.B. Davis"
2,Also disappointed,"When I put them in the dishwasher, they became discolored. They're sharp enough to cut open my finger, but not to chop green peppers and celery nicely. They got two stars because I also have a set of Stanley knives - which have rusted in under six months."
2,Rusting Problem,"I received this set as a gift from my husband 2 years ago. He bought it for me because it had the stainless and black handles, and thought Farberware was a good name. We didn't own a dishwasher, so it is hard for me to understand why ... but all the knives got little bits of rust on them within a year of having them, and washing them by hand. Personally, I wouldn't waste my money on this item..."
2,You get what you pay for,"Nice looking set, but they have a tendency to rust. Also I have to sharpen them quite a bit before using them for most vegetables (onions, tomatos). I can't really complain given the price, and in buying Farberware, I shouldn't expect Henckels or Wusthof quality, but I must say that the dullness and rust are very annoying."
2,tiddlywinks,Playing this game in general - Tiddly winks is fun for everyone. Grandpa and the 3 year old both enjoyed playing.This specific version -It was very flimsy and poorly manufactured. You get a thin plastic scoring box to shoot the tiddly winks into. a Ziplock container is made of much more durable plastic. The plastic is easily crushed by young kids and the small discs and tiny felt pads just get lost. the felt was so small it was really just useless. For what you get this game should have cost less then a dollar. For this price it should have a specific container for small parts and a more durable scoring cup.
1,JUNK,A piece of junk. Total waste of money. I threw it away after trying to play once. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL
3,Not for baking lasgne,"This is a beautiful casserole dish; however, I wanted one for lasgne. This dish is 12.5 by 8.5 inchs that slopes to the bottom to 10 by 6 inches. On the underneath side of the bottom it says 9 X 12. The ridge around the edge is great for handling. It holds 3 quarts from bottom to brim. The description fails to list that it has sloping sides. Sloping sides are not functional for removing lasgne intact. I kept it because it is so beautiful and my other corning ware are great after 25 years(hope this lasts as well since corning was recently sold to another company). I will continue to look for a great looking lasgne dish. Only 3 stars for lacking a complete description."
3,Not What I Expected,"I wanted this as a temporary replacement for a student who had broken their hand. It worked OK, but it just wasn't what I expected."
3,"Functional, with one problem.","I really like this tool kit because it contains a basic assortment of tools. It has everything I need to tinker with and take apart computers and electronics. This kit lost two stars because of one problem, the wire striper/cutter does not cut well. They strip fine, but don't seem to be sharp enough to cut well. Three stars is a pass, but wish I had paid less for this kit which such a major flaw."
3,"great multi purpose, not the best for computers","I'll start off by saying the tools were mostly great quality. they all felt solid and no doubt would be useful for small fixes round the house. However, I predominately work with laptops and the screwdriver bits are just too big for most laptops. There were a lot of different torque sizes, but only 2 Phillips heads and 2 or 3 flat ones. the ones that were provided were solid and worked well, but they were too large for laptop screws. It could have easily been fixed if they included smaller bits, but they did not. That's really my only gripe but since that was the only reason I bought it, I had to return it. No problem with quality and the price is cheap for what you get and I would have to blame myself if the kit wasn't marketed for computers but since it was I had to mark it down a tad. Will probably head to best buy and get the Dynex version I saw, as it's almost Identical to this but includes smaller bits as well for around the same price."
2,All-inclusive but marginal Quality,"This computer tool kit was probably worth the price I paid for it, however, the quality of the tools is marginal The wrist strap is not the elastic one, it is velcro which is inferior and cumbersome. The nut driver broke the first time I used it. Unfortunately the warranty expired the day after I realized this. Back to do some more shopping."
2,Not put together by someone who actually works on computers.,"Ordered this a few days ago and received it today. Great service, bad product. The screwdriver is so big and bulky that it's not really practical for working inside a computer case. The big heavy handle and bit coupling get in the way and it's hard to see small parts around it. The tweezers and chip puller are all metal, thus prone to ESD that can harm sensitive computer electronics. Would have been better to have anti-static plastic handles like most kits do. The groundiing bracelet must be the cheapest one made. The snap unsnaps with the slightest movement, breaking the ground connection. I wish I had chosen a kit that was maybe a bit more expensive, but at least usable. I wish I could return this one, but you have to open the packaging to see how bad the kit is, and once it's open, it's yours. NOT worth the bother of owning it. :-("
5,Belkin toolset,"Contains what is needed for normal client or server hardware tech use. With Belkins lifetime guarantee on top, it is hard to give anything else than 5 stars."
5,Great Computer Tool Kit,"New kit, provided me with all the tools I needed to startmy computer repair course. Thank you."
4,Very Satisfied,"I was looking for an alternative to the same size Fellows tool kit, and I was very satisfied with what I found here. At the same price, this product is alot better quality."
4,7 years ago but might as well,"It has served me well since year 2005 to 2006. However the hex ring is of poor construction. Actually the wrench set survives to be of use today, But honestly no one changes chips on their motherboards now so it's quite an outdated set"
3,It serves its purpose,"So I like the anti static wrist band, the double ended screwdriver has been useful, the screw and parts case has come in handy already, The tri pronged screw holder (pick-r-upper) has already proved invaluable, I hope it holds up. Don't think I will ever use the main screwdriver as I have better quality here already. Kind of useless to have a bunch of standard size screw bits and screwdriver in an electronics repair case. Definitley lacking in electronics gauged bits ( actually ridiculously so... 1 phillips, 1 flat...that's it)"
2,Screwdriver Broke First Use,"I was excited to get this kit, but then the screwdriver broke the first use. The little ball that holds in the screwdriver bit came out and can't be repaired. Will RMA and order another. If that one is better will update review, as this did seem like a pretty nice set until it broke so easily. Maybe I got a dud."
2,Subpar toolkit,"Let's face it, these aren't high quality automotive parts, there not meant for stress. After a few years of sparingly using this toolkit. The driver magnet fell out, so bits don't stay in place. The bits are damaged and chipped.There are better sets out there, the wirestripper is a JOKE. Your better off buying a good quality brand name set, snapon, craftsmen, even duralast."
4,Memories of Bolivia and Peru!,I bought this book to learn more about the Andean textiles I began collecting while working in Peru and Bolivia. The photos are beautiful and the info is pretty good-good for a beginner but probably not as helpful for a collector with more expertise. There are not many books on this subject and I'm interested to know if anyone has found a better one.
3,Memoirs of Victor Hugo,A lot of discussion surrounding associates of Hugo who I was not familiar with detracted from the read. It was enlightening to discover the role and presence of Hugo in the French revolution meetings and to discover the broad following he enjoyed amongst classes of French society.
2,Hard to read,"I'm sure it's a brilliant work, but the reproduction looks like a bad photocopy. Since I'd purchased it as a Christmas gift for my dad, this was a bit of an embarassment."
1,Not Good,"I purchased these for my 5 year old son as he still has accidents periodically. They never worked and he would still wet his bed...which would result in changing sheets in the middle of the night and cleaning him up. I would PASS on these!! I just purchased the ""GoodNites"" Nighttime Underwear and they work great. He already wet himself and his pajamas and bed stayed dry."
2,louisiana purchase,The jar is big and looks just like the picture but the lid is not airtight.There was no rubber seal.The lid just sits on top.It will slide off if you are not careful.
5,LOVE THIS!!!,"I decided to buy new canisters for my kitchen & I need 1 that was larger for the sugar - I love this one! The chalkboard is too cute, this had held up very well!"
3,Uhh,Life is too short because it is only 17 minutes at a time for 5 hours of charging. Lights up my entire street at night though. VERY POWERFUL
5,Light works great,"I am very happy with the light. I purchased a 2nd one for a backup due to the relatively short use period before a recharge is need (about 15 min.). But, for the brightness of the light I can see why. If you are too close to your subject the light does have a beam effect. Over 4-5 feet aways seems to work best for an overall enhancement of the lighting."
3,Works good. Battery life limiting,"The product works good. It brightens up indoor shots enough to take good video; but the battery life is low. For an occasional shot, I don't worry about it, but if you're planning on an extended period of shooting, have some extra battery packs."
2,Seems more like stamped metal rather than diecast,"Heading says it all. Product description says it is die-cast. If it is, it's awfully flimsy. I was hoping for something less likely to twist."
3,As expected,Nice frame; as expected. Nothing more to say except it looks nice. Cheap construction; could be cheaper or part of an add-on item
3,Sleak Simple Cover,"This is a simple license plate cover that, in the end gets it's job done.Glossy, so if you don't want it Glossy and more Matte look elsewhere.Also seems to be a little small when covering the license plate, but does fit albeit barely."
5,it is what it is,"Not much to say about this, it's just a really basic black license plate frame. It's black. I would say the finish is more matte than glossy. Looks great on my car, frames in the plate without having to give the dealership free advertising for the life of your car."
4,Slightly flimsy - thin metal construction,I could foresee a problem with this frame if you only used the two top screw holes and left the rest dangling. The thin metal construction might be liable to bend. But using all four mount points makes the problem moot and it looks sharp and is dirt cheap if you figure in free shipping.
5,Highly Recommended!,"At first glance, this book may look like just another tediously detailed behind-the-scenes guide to picking stocks. But the delightful surprise concocted by authors Charles M. LaLoggia and Cherrie Mahon is the book's page-turner narrative and laugh-out-loud wit, which they often use effectively to nail critical points. The authors focus on how to spot and invest in undervalued companies. We from getAbstract recommend this book to investment professionals (hey, the way things are going, a few fresh insights can't hurt) as well as to anyone, including Sunday speculators in need of a good laugh."
5,A must have for children's music appreciation!,"I purchased this DVD after my 22 month old fell in love with Laurie Berkner's song ""B-O-O-T-S""! I found this DVD on Amazon and, although the BOOTS song is not on the DVD, my daughter will sit and watch or dance along with the entire 45 minute DVD. Her music is very catchy and I find myself singing it throughout the day. I am so impressed with the DVD that I went back and purchased another one of her DVDs and a music CD as well."
4,"Good, but missing Family","I might not have gotten this if I realized Family was not included. Any one know why it was left out? I like that I can only select songs that makes it nice, when I only want the kids to watch a little."
5,"Once again, Laurie Berkner pleases","Laurie Berkner writes catchy, fun, musically interesting songs that even adults can enjoy! The songs on this disc are some of our favorites, and we were so happy the 'fast and slow' was included. My only minor complaint is that since Nicolodean produced it, you have some annoying character skits included and previews to skip. I liked her first DVD a little better because it's only her music and nothing else! But I'm happy with this DVD, my 16 month old loves it, and I like that it doesn't have too many repeats from her other DVD."
3,sooo sad!,"We bought it because we read it the Family song was in it, but it is not and I was just making my son get sooo excited about it and then the music was not in it so everybody got really sad!We keep waiting for the one with THE FAMILY song!"
4,Little girl doesn't like Moose and Zee,"My little girl just got this for Christmas, and the first time she watched it she got upset every time Moose and Zee came on. Moose and Zee come on between every song segment and she didn't like it. She would start yelling ""Laurie Berkner"". I think people who order this are ordering it to get Laurie Berkner, not Nick Jr.I also didn't realize it was going to have songs from her last DVD on it as well. I thought it would be all new songs. But overall, I think my little girl will enjoy watching it (once she gets used to this format), and I definitely don't mind listening to it in the car (especially compared to some of her DVD's)."
3,"Not as good as ""Let's hear it for the Laurie Berkner Band"" but good!","I LOVE the fact that this dvd repeats itself when it gets to the end...ANY children's dvd should do that! This one isn't as fun and energetic as the Lets Hear it for the Laurie Berkner Band dvd, but my 2 year old still loved it!"
5,Laurie Berkner is awesome!,"This is a great DVD! I have a 3 year old and twin 2 year olds and they ask for ""Laurie Berkner please mom."" They love the songs and sing along. It also has quite the calming effect on three little boys. I am going to purchase more of her DVDs!"
4,"Great show, but you need a new DVD player!","This is a great DVD that our daughter loves to sing and dance to, but it won't play on either of our ""older"" DVD players, it will only play on our new car DVD player and she can't dance in the car! We won't be able to watch it in the house until we buy a new DVD player. :("
3,So Dissapointed!,My daughter is heartbroken that FAMILY was not included! We were so excited for the new DVD!
4,A good start,"Upon reading this book I feel the author is doing her best through examples of others to demonstrate those that have hit burnout. Once its established if you have reached it, or if you are on your way, she moves on to how this can happen, and how much you are empowered to change this. Tips and ideas are given on how to reduce stress and how to help change or tailor your job in a direction that you have the most power. She does not advocate moving on before you have resolved some of the internal issues that have caused your displeasure at your current job. I feel ths examples of how real people in the book overcame their burnout and became happy and sucessful once again."
4,Very Pleased,"This book helped me quite a bit!. I just finished reading it and the first thing I am going to do is read it again! This time I am going to take better notes. There were a couple of typographical errors, but it was not big deal because the content was spot on! I don't buy into every thing she said, but there were many practical tools that I could start using immediately to make my situation better. Being a manager, I especially liked the TASC Plus technique she teaches. When I first started reading the book, I felt validated by the way she described burn out. Very motivating and useful information."
2,Credibility,"I find it difficult to give a self-help book much credibility when it is filled with spelling errors, grammar errors and printing errors. I would think that someone who cares enough to write a book to help people could at least care enough to check her work."
4,"Any Broken Lizard fan would love this, obviously.","i am a big Broken Lizard fan, because they are 5 guys who get to do what they love, and that is work together and make comedy. in everything they do, you can see that they're having so much fun.chances are that you know their style of humor if you're going to buy this dvd. there are reasons why drinking, smoking, and sex are popular comedy topics. Broken Lizard surely embraces these topics, but there is more to their work than just cheap jokes. it's different to see them do stand up, enjoyable to see them individually. and it's very strong and funny when they share the stage in storytelling or sketches. makes me wish i could have seen a live show.personally, while i laughed at their stage work, my favorite parts of this dvd are in the special features. seeing the mini-documentary of them on the road and backstage was a real treat. the chemistry and camaraderie is fun to watch. i hope they one day make a full-length documentary like this."
4,Shipped on time - arrived undamaged,"This product was shipped on time and arrived undamaged, so the seller lived up to their end. The DVD itself is enjoyable, though not as funny as I might have hoped."
3,Chinese Shamanic Tiger Qigong,"I read the book but wanted more guidance for this fabulous Qigong series. The DVD is well produced, beautiful to watch but even with a voice over, it is hard to learn the transitions and movement."
1,These cute disks stink!!!!,TWO times have I lost precious information while using the cute colored disks!! I recommend not buying these disks and going with perhaps 3M.And thank you Memorex for wasting my time and money!
5,"Buy this book, and you won't NEED to visit St. Petersburg.","The most gorgeous, comprehensive photographic panorama of the treasures of St. Petersburg. Even if your exposure to St. Petersburg is limited to the Winter Palace, (now the ""Hermitage"" museum), BUY this book AND buy the unreal, almost surreal DVD ""Russian Ark"". Both are BREATHTAKING!"
4,Silver,"Very pretty set. I give it 4 stars because it dulled very quickly, but served its purpose for the day."
3,A good variation on a traditional theme,"Not as good as ""the three little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig"" but still, an interesting twist. The story is the usual, and the beachy scenes are pretty nice. It's a good way to introduce children to Hawaii, even though it doesn't accurately portray the devastation of the islands by the introduced pigs. :-) Can't have everything in a kids book, can we? :-)Maybe I'll like it more after I go to Hawaii."
2,There must be a 24-karat nugget supplied with this CD...,"There is nothing special about this multi-piano Bach recording (made in France):Name of the pianists might ""ring a bell"" with some potential buyers who more importantly might want to look at other offering of this exact repertoire and at a much, much lower price.But if you are about to order this (cartel-inflated up-scaled pricy item), make sure that upon receiving it you will search for the potential 24-karat golden nugget that might have been shipped with the CD..."
5,Happy,great chalk . my son and daughter love it. Would buy a gain...was a a great value too. Great product
2,"Loose chalk, not powdered chalk","If you're looking for powdered chalk, look elsewhere. The jar I got had some powdered chalk, but mostly it was chunks. The chunks range in size from almost 3"" across down to pea size. I'm used to powdered chalk, so maybe that's why I don't like it, but I have to crush the chunks in my chalk bag before I can get a good coat of chalk on my hands. Not what you want to do when you're on a route and your hands are getting greasy. My go-to chalk is Bison Competition Chalk, and it looks like I'm going back to it! I thought I'd go out on a limb and try something new, but no luck this time."
2,Not good,It was like reading a high school term paper. The book that was used for a constant source is a better option.
3,Disapointed....,"After 106 pages of stories of how great E-Bay is and how he & his mother sell on it all the time, the author finally gives some info to the reader on what you need to get started. Unfortunately after another few pages he goes into do's and don'ts that complicate the whole process. At this point Im rather leary of doing anything on E-Bay esp. selling. As of this date Ive turned it all over to my partner including the book. I had hoped for a simple stage by stage set-up for selling, this book was to boring and complicated for this old bird....."
5,"How to Buy, Profit and sell on ebay.","I thought the book was excellent. It had so much information to help anyone who wants to get started or already has on ebay. Alot of tips I have not heard before, Highly Recommend!!"
2,Cut to the Point,"It is my optinion that this book is over rated by other reviewers. Too much space is devoted to the auhtor and his family's background. If that is not enough, it is repeated over and over.If you condensed the book down to just the tips on getting started with eBay, it would fill about 15 pages. That is also taking into account that there is not too much text on a page.The author appears to be very successful and knowledgeable about eBay. He provides the reader with valuable information. Getting to that information requires patience. For those individuals that like to read in the bathroom, this book may be a good choice."
4,How to Buy Sell & Profit on eBay,There is a lot of very useful information told in a light hearted easy to understand way. It is very worthwhile vor a beginner but it is superficial. I am doubtful about some of his claims of success.
5,"How to Buy, Sell, and Profit on eBay",Very informative for the individual that wants to learn how to buy and sell on eBay. The author keeps his information simple and offers very helpful suggestions.R.Brock
5,Excellent book,Author Adam Ginsberg gives the reader some great ideas and tips to become a success on ebay. The book is well researched and easy to read. The examples given in the book illustrate and serve as great guidelines to make it on ebay. Definitely recommend.
1,Too...,"... many repetitions, too many pages, too much cross-selling.Most of the tips are public secret, that you can find for free on the eBay bulletin boards and help pages.Mr. Gisnberg does however an outstanding job to promote his other (paying) services."
2,Only for the newbie,"Just finished the book last night hoping to find ideas that I could implement in my eBay sales. No real new info here. More geared for the eBay novice. If you have any experience buying or selling on eBay you already know 99% of the info provided in this book.I found it odd that the author claims to have sold a 4 year old pair of very worn sneakers on eBay for $21 in the beginning of the book and then talks about it again later in the book but the sale price was $26.Also, the author refers you to links to third party paid services which he owns."
5,TO THE POINT,Ginsberg points you to information you need to know in a style that brings E-Bay alive!
4,Business on Ebay,Book extemely informative learned alot of new things great for a person who needs to further they knowledge on ebay and its possibilities.
4,Lots of information for the beginner.,"There is a lot of information to get you excited about starting to buy/sell on Ebay. A tiny bit too many ""stories"", but excellent source of the basics. Just be sure to flag pages as you go to reference and your start up will be much easier. Just attended Ebay 101 class ($95) and much of the stuff I had already learned from this book. Definitely worth the price of the book."
2,"Readable, Good Information, But a Serious Omission","This book has good information for the learner eBay-er. But it has a serious shortcoming. It has no index! Much of the book seems to be written down as narrated by the author. This means it is very readable, but the information on each topic is scattered in several sections throughout the book. Finding a topic for the first time (or trying to recall where it was) is frustrating and time-cosuming. There are other eBay books (such as various ""Dummies Guides"" that I would recommend as better than this book. Additionally the production (paper, printing) is surprisingly mediocre."
5,How to Profit From Adam Ginsberg's book,"Adam Ginsberg has already put an extra $7499 in my pocket in only two weeks since I read his book ""How to Buy, Sell, & Profit on eBay."" He gives so many great and highly usable tips I haven't gotten to most of them. I believe just one tip from this book about how to set yourself apart from everyone else using a special photo technique has already been so powerful.How do you profit from Adam's book -- Buy it!I'm a believer!Greg Arnold"
3,good but obsolete information,I liked the book but considering it was written in 2005 you have to keep in mind that alot of the data is outdated and/or obsolete. I hope he comes out with a new version.
5,Great book!,Great book loaded with so much information. I read and reread it many times. Tons of great ideas and really gets you motivated to sell. Would recommend it to anyone.
5,Excellent book!,"Though I'm only about halfway through the book right now, I absolutely love it! Adam Ginsberg has a very gifted way of making the material fun and entertaining while teaching you alot at the same time. I could not have chosen a better book to learn about Ebay. It has helped me tremendously with my ambition to become an Ebay powerseller. I highly recommend it!"
4,well written...,"An excellent book but lacks the depth of Musil, the exuberance of Joyce and the obssessive dissection of detail that is uniquely Proust...still worth a read."
2,Not quite worth the effort,"A Book of Memories is a vast, challenging novel that is alternately rewarding and disappointing. When it connects -- as in the vivid anecdotes illustrating the way Stalinism corrupted the personal lives of all Hungary's inhabitants during the early 1950s -- it can be very powerful. However, I found that too much of the book was dedicated to ruminative digressions describing, in minutest detail, the inner workings of the protagonist's mind. At first, these were interesting, but after a while they became tiresome. A Book of Memories has its significant rewards, but they require a big chunk of reading time to wade through the chaff. For me, it was not worth it."
2,Confusing and not very rewarding read.,"I was very disappointed in this book, which was hailed as being like Proust, like Mann, Joyce, etc. I didn't find the depth of any of these authors in this novel; it was confusing and difficult to read. Maybe this is because I don't understand enough about the last three decades behind the Iron Curtain. But the book did not illumine them! To me, it just seemed to go endless and boringly into the characters' sexual pecularities. This sounds as if the book would at least be sexy, but it was not. There was a lot of material that I felt could have been interesting -- the whole plot line about one narrator and his father, who was involved in the repressive regime, for instance. But the way it was presented, I just grew more and more confused and bored. I much prefer other Hungarian literature I have read, such as Moricz's BE FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH and anything by Kozstolanyi, but these books tend to be harder to find."
3,Doesn't live up to the hype,"Not a bad book, though a little hard to read. Nadas writes well, but he's no Proust or Musil, and it's difficult to become engrossed by this story."
4,Very Durable,"I have been using this bag 3 - 4 times per week for the past year, and it still looks like I purchased it yesterday. None of the seams have unravelled, nor have I had to reattached any buttons. The front pocket is large enough to hold my wallet and keys, or it can fit up to a standard 1 litre water bottle (with the flap open).The reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because I think it's a little too roomy. The diameter is approximately 8 1/2 inches (21cm) I can fit 2 yoga mats in my bag and still have folds of fabric. When I throw a towel or change of clothes in with my mat it begins to look like an extra long duffel bag."
4,Good not excellent,"It's a very good product but for Vista I would go with Acrobat 9. 8 and 9 are practically the same in terms of what a user can do. Adobe cleaned some of the bugs in Version 9, which is particularly important for Windows Vista."
4,Great must-have product,"Creating a pdf from any other format is almost a must capabiity, however I was a bit disappointed Adobe imbedded itself everywhere. Good from a usability standpoint, but ask me first if I want to do that. In all, no problems with the product, in installation or use.Window Media Center, Gateway laptop w/ AMD Turion64 & 1 gig RAM."
4,Money well spent,"Very pleased with the software. Easy install, no system conflicts and all the added upgrades, wizards and gizmos makes this product much more than simply a PDF maker. I'm a skeptic with most things, but this time my expectations were surpassed."
3,"It's okay, but not great","The software does everything it's supposed to do, but not easily. It's the only thing out there, though, so at least it's better than nothing."
1,Acrobat has become bloatware...,"This is really quite disappointing- Acrobat, which used to be a quick, low-resource alternative to text delivery, has become a piece of software so bloated that it crashes constantly, takes an eternity to install or uninstall, and is generally not worth the upgrade. I'd wager that 90% of people would be just fine with Acrobat from 6 years ago, and most of the ""features"" added to this suite are unnecessary and actually detrimental to the software. Avoid, and look for open-source alternatives!"
1,Buying this was a mistake!,"Adobe will not support this product without a $40 fee. My version will not work, will not uninstall, will not repair, will not do anything. After an hour of explaining this to tech in a foreign country with very hard to understand English, they said they knew the answer, it was simple and that they would tell me just as soon as I paid them $40. Highway robbery!!!"
2,Falls Way Short of Expectations,"This piece of software is disappointing at best. Too many seemingly basic things are incredibly difficult to do. For example, try formatting text from the default red, 10 point font. Only a search of the internet clued me in that pressing ""Ctrl - E"" would magically pop up a text formatting toolbar. Merging pdfs is clunky at best. There is no simple way to add pages from one file to a new one. Toolbars seem to disappear at will. I would not recommend spending 200+ dollars for this unpredictable piece of software. Adobe should dominate the PDF creation market but it would take very little to surpass this product."
1,Very Unstable!!!,Even after installing the 2 updates it still freezes (Windows XP). DO NOT upgrade to version 8 ...
1,Bloated and Unstable,"Another bloated, greedy and unstable piece of software from Adobe. Software whos auto-update feature caused my entire software suite to crash as Adobe burrows into everything for Word and Outlook to Internet Exploiter and Explorer. Here's the kicker, the Adobe software won't let you uninstall or reinstall, generating a consistent error that is not documented on Adobes website. And if you even bother to try their customer support line, find a comfortable chair and make a drink, you're gonna need it."
1,"Not for VISTA, validation problems and terrible tech support","Although this is a valuable product when it works. Beware, Adobe tech support told me that it NOT VISTA COMPATIBLE. We have personal experience of this. Additionally, as with all Adobe products their validation process often does not work. We have spent hours on the phone and come to heated tempers when trying to validate a legitimate Adobe product. Validation also stopped working after a few weeks and we had to repeat the process and encurr hours of loss time. We have also had Adobe updates crash the entire system which took day to fix with many incompetent tech support staff members."
1,By all means try before you buy!,"I'm so glad that I installed a trial version of Acrobat 8 Professional prior to buying it. Luckily, I did not need to uninstall a working version of the product in order to install the trial version, unlike the previous reviewer. The program crashed at least a dozen times during my first hour of use, and I wasn't trying to do anything complicated. For example, the program simply disappeared without a trace when I pressed the Settings button during a Save as... dialog or attempted to Edit -> Preferences for HTML export."
1,Version 8.1.0 does not work at all,"Like many other reviewers, My version would not even load to the opening screen before an error code and system shutdown occurred. I downloaded 8.1.0 direct from Adobe and installed it on a professional workstation. An HP xw9300 with Windows Professional XP with all service packs and no viruses or spybots. I tried an hour with Adobe customer support but got nowhere. They outsource telephone support to India. I talked to two separate individuals that did not even know how to use their own computer. Don't even think of buying this product."
5,good content,"the book itself is a paperback edition and arrived a bit damaged for moisture, paper package was not waterproof, somehow during transit time moisture entered and thus presentation for book finish is not good.On the other hand, it has sooo much deep precious content making the outer image a small detail with no importance at all. Enjoy!"
1,How Many Keys????,"It's a simple question that none of the descriptions answer. I need a key for each lock; but this is useless when they intentionally leave out this important information. I already bought one set of similar locks at AMAZON only to find out there weren't enough keys. Buyer beware.Becoming an old story here: poor descriptions, slow delivery. Shopping elsewhere."
2,Don't close easily,"I needed the long locks for some tool cabinets. I found that the locks were difficult to close. I thought maybe it was just the way they were situated on the tool cabinet, but even when I took them off and tried to close them they were difficult to close. Maybe I just had a defective package, but I found them poor quality."
2,More annoying than relaxing...,"I bought this on the basis of other reviews as I was looking for something small and uncomplicated to help me relax and meditate at the end of each work day.With each sound what you get is about 5 seconds of recording repeated over and over. Once you pick up on the repetition, it's actually more annoying than relaxing. I love beach sounds but the seagulls were just irritating.Plus, the sound quality was horrible, with a lot of static. You certainly get what you pay for and I immediately requested a return with full refund. I will be looking for something else of better quality to help me relax and meditate."
5,Fantastic British Hard Rock,"This is absolutely killer 2 CD compilation with first 3 albums. How these guys never made it big, is beyond me. I have never even heard about them until recently, although I have a collection of several thousand CD's and LP's from 60's and 70's.This is very intelligent hard rock, produced by Bill Wyman from Rolling Stones. I can't stop listening to this CD. This goes to top 20 of my music collection."
3,Fun & Breezy,"This is a fun and breezy romp through and around Washington DC, with spy ""stories"" organized by geographic location. I was looking for more meat and something more current. The stories span the time frame from George Washington's era through the Civil War and up to mid 1980s. It would be great to fill the gap over the last twenty plus years with many more current tales. An enjoyable, but extremely LIGHT read! If you're looking for literature, this is not it. If you want a light sail and superficiality, just a plain fun read... you'll enjoy this book."
5,Very Good Movie,If you like the Comics Archie I recomend this Movie.I had the oppertunity to work on this movie and we all had fun filmimg.
4,i think all archie fans would like this,If you like archie and his freinds. Or action I think you would like it.The good things was it had all the charachters except Chuck Clayton.The bad thing was it had a boring part or two
1,A nice try,"When ever I travel I always buy Arche comics because they provide joyous laughs. Watching this movie a week ago made me realize that some comics shouldn't be made into movies. The cast mainly full of unknowns excepet for Lauren Holly. The plot revoles around the gang at their high school reunion. But where are Chuck and Dilton ? Another flaw is having the same charcters play each other when their 15 which is dumb. The film's low point comes when Jughead tries to rap. I would made this film when the gang was in high school and have them reunite at the end instead of baseing the whole film around the reunion. I'm also thankful that the feature film version that was in devolpement back in 2001 with a cast incudling Tobey Maugiure,Joshua Jackson and Christina Ricci got stuck in devlopment hell."
4,"A Pleasant Read, Well Written","Wonderboy tells the story of Ro Skews, who is moving from the city to the country. A city girl ar heart, her aloof husband and eccentric son make the move ever harder for her. She struggles at first but gradually gains more control over her life. The reader will smile at her victories and cry when things seem to be falling apart. Bits of humor speckle the story, always keeping it interesting and light. I finished the book in a day; it is very addicting."
2,didn't keep my interest,"I started this book, but honestly did not get far. It did not grab my interest so I put it down..."
1,Wonderboy,"Abruptly, Ro finds her life uprooted when her husband moves the family to the countryside. Immediately, she is faced with a plethora of problems, from faulty cars, vermin, and other majorly minor catastrophes, not the least of which is her family life. Her son, Tod, is at the best of times, a challenge thanks to developmental problems. Her marriage is steadily going downhill, but there is nothing she can put her finger on, and Ro herself is constantly overshadowed by a sense of inadequacy. * Not until nearly the end of the book do we get a clue about why these things might be happening. However, this book suffers from two major drawbacks. First, it is written in the present tense, which is a very distracting format for the reader. Second, it falls into the category of pwp- plot, what plot? The rambling style is peppered with slang that is not familiar to most American readers and often seems rather pointless. *Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
5,"Lots of examples, lots of tables, lots of fun","This book was my first exposure to Number Theory, coming from an engineering background. This book got me hooked. You could almost say the book takes an engineering approach to number theory: Lots of examples, lots of tables but not a lot of rigorous, long proofs. This book is set apart from most textbooks by those facts. You won't find such extensive examples and tables in any textbook (and I have about 50+ texts on Number Theory). Conversly, no self-respesting professor could present so many results without proof. But that's the fun of this book. I recommend this book over ""An Adventures Guide to Number Theory"" by Richard Friedberg for uninitiated."
2,Poor Setup,"I love Ms. L'Engle's work, but the setup of this book just didn't work for me. I liked the idea, but the execution didn't come through."
4,Daily Reflections,I've been using this book as part of my daily prayer/meditation. I enjoy L'Engle's approach to Christianity and spirituality.
1,Designed to befuddle,"This chart is horrible. It does not list the chords in chromatic order. Top row is A, second row goes down to A-flat, third row goes UP to B, then down to B-flat, so on. If that wasn't bad enough, the last three rows of the chart are F-sharp, G, and G-flat. I am not joking."
2,Didn't see the shipping cost,"I was drawn in by the ""low"" price. What I didn't notice was $7.99 shipping cost(very subtle) and the 4-5 days to ""process"" the order. What could possibly take so long to ship this? I'm thinking of canceling the order, with their processing speed I should have plenty of time to make up my mind."
4,Asterix in Arvenia,"Yet another rollicking Asterix adventure, taking place in the provinces of Gaul . When Chief Vitalstatistix takes ill, Druid Getafix suggests that he go to a health spa at Aqua Calidae in the Arvenian countryside.While leaving Vitalstatistix at the spa, our friends decide to tour the Arvenian countryside, and in the process, deal a humiliating blow to Julius Caesar's special envoy, Tribune Noxius Vapus.When Vapus goes to Rome to report his defeat to Caesar, he is ordered to find the famous shield of Gaullish national hero, Vercingetorix.The result: a race against time with Asterix and Obelix searching for the shield and the Romans searching for the shield, as well as our heroes.Once more Asterix and Obelix get up to some fantastic escapades and as always, this adventure is filled with wit, puns and double puns, including a reference to Lug the Gd of Business and Industry."
5,Very informative...,"This book is an excellent collection of studies into the lifestyle of S&M, Domination and submission, etc. A very good read, well put together and well thought out."
3,Hood/lens shade,"It is a typical Cokin in that it is easy to use and fits well with the overall system. However, I had hoped it would shade the area between the filter and the lens. When using the Cokin IR filter, light comes in between the filter and lens. I had hoped this would solve it but it does not. I guess it requires the judicious application of duct tape."
2,Eh,I was excited about starting this book when I bought it because I found its structure (explaining how much war has affected American history by using the stories of 9 individuals) to be unique but I just couldn't get into it and gave up after 330 pages. Their thesis just couldn't be held together by the different stories and it reads more like a history book about the individuals.Good book for picking up useless knowledge not for stimulating the mind.
5,Classic,"A monumental synthesis, a towering, brave work of beautifully written and exhaustively studied history - and this is all the reception it gets? This should be required reading for every American, precisely because it may be debatable or controversial in its points or selections. There is no question in my mind that this magnificent book will stand ever larger in history, as its profound yet caustic thesis receives its next confirmation by the imperial aggression by the national security monolith we have inherited."
3,I returned this item.// It did not fit my camera.,I returned this item since it did not fit with my camera.
4,"Works okay, but","I demo'd this product and it seemed to work fine.Better than the builtin XP utility, that's for sure.But as I searched for ""defragmentation utilities"" on the web, I came across the Raxco product called Perfect disk.I remembered the RAXCO name, from my days of working on VAX/VMS computers.I didn't know they made a PC version of their defrag utility though. So I went to the Raxco website and checked it out.Diskeeper worked okay.But, in my opinion, I liked the speed/performance/features of the Raxco ""Perfectdisk"" product better."
1,Out of Stock,"I recently ordered this item that was to go with another item i ordered thru amazon. They sent the one item but said this is out of stock. if it is out of stock, why is it still here showing as available. if they kept it current, i wouldn't be stuck with the other item."
4,A good choice,"We purchased two of these for my workplace. I have one and the other was purchased for a co-worker. I put them together myself and found them easy to assemble. Once mounted, they're surprisingly stable and sturdy and do the job of holding my keyboard and mouse just fine.It can be adjusted in a number of directions, which is helpful although even more flexibility in positioning it would be a good thing.Overall, I recommend this item."
4,These are very good!,"I ordered two of these, they got here in a timely manner, they are exactly what expected only a little bigger, which is good. They are kind of a pain to install, but that could have been the fault of the Installer!(that would be Me). I am very happy with them and would shop at this company's site again."
5,Kensington Underdesk Supershelf Plus Keyboard & Mousetray,I was extremely surprised as to how stong and srurdy this tray is even tho it is plastic. I'm real happy with this purchase.
3,Some shortcomings to consider,"As basic keyboard drawers go, this one is certainly adequate -- but no more. It's relatively sturdy, operates smoothly and installs fairly easily. But it does have some shortcomings to consider.1. The space for your mouse is very small. If you need to move the cursor from one side of the screen to the other, there just isn't enough room move your mouse in that big of an arc.2. The drawer does not lock into position. If you bump it with your stomach, it will move in, which can be annoying.3. I wish it had a bigger range of height adjustment. The full range is only an inch and a half. In practical terms it's even less, because at its upper limit (closest to the desk bottom), there wouldn't be room for the mouse."
3,"Item is nice, dimensions are misleading",The keyboard drawer seemed to be of good quality but beware- the dimension listed of 26 inches is only talking about the tray. My desk required the tray to fit in a 27.5 inch spot and this keyboard tray is too big. You have to allot for at least 3 inches for mounting the tray.
4,"Good product, but...","Product is well built and easily installed, but has less than adequate room for operating a mouse. More width needed."
4,Sturdy & Solid,I am happy with this keyboard drawer. The tray itself is plastic but so far I have had no issues and it has held up to the constant use. If you have an extended gaming keyboard this drawer might be a little small and probably won't fit your mouse (I have a logitech G11).
3,Kinston Underdesk Keyboard Drawer,"This is an okay product. It operates as advertised, but installation was difficult under a wooden shelf that supports my monitor. It takes some woodworking skill but can be done. After I installed it, I found that the space for the mouse was rather restricted, which is a minus for an otherwise okay product."
1,Poorly manufactured,"I thought I had found just what I was looking for when I ordered this; then, I tried to assemble it. I generally have no problem putting things together--cribs, bicycles, furniture--but I had a lot of trouble with the instructions for this keyboard tray. The written instructions were not clear, and the illustrations were difficult to figure out. I called Kensington customer service with questions, and the agent was as confused as I was. When I finally determined the directions for one part of the assembly, I found that ""part a"" and ""part b"" could not be attached because the factory had misaligned the holes. At that point, I gave up and returned the tray."
2,Plastic tray and metal screws = faulty design,"Buyer beware, you may receive a unit where the holes for the metal screws are so badly created in the plastic tray that the plastic will actually begin to split open when you begin to assemble the unit by attaching the screws. Such a major design flaw that I am returning the tray. Very disappointed, as this was the perfect size for my narrow desk and over-sized ergonomic keyboard."
3,Not bad - could be better,"I needed a tray to get the keyboard of the desk, allowing more room and putting the keyboard at a more ergonomical height. It does that. However, installation was not so easy. Using the brackets that come with it, aligning front to rear and side to side proved somewhat of a challenge. It would be nice if they included a template for drilling the holes. An older model I had made by Fellows came with a template and installation was a breeze. The MS Ergonomic keyboard takes up the entire tray so, no room for the mouse. No biggie - still a great improvement over having them both on the desk top."
3,underdesk keyboard kinda a hassle to install,Purchased this keyboard drawer and had to have my son come over to help install. The directions were crappy pictures.
3,Keyboard drawer missing screws,"I haven't installed it yet because the screws are missing. The shipping box was the original box for the drawer. It was opened when I got it, and there was nothing to secure it. There was not even tape to close the ends. It arrived without the screws, so I have to go buy screws before I can install it."
5,Just what I wanted,It is just what it looked like and installed even easier. Everything that was need in the kit was there.
2,Objectives missing,"There are no information on 3 exam objectives: Common architectures, Legacy connectivity, and Messaging. That is why I give the book 2 stars. This book is ONLY useful as a study guide, and as such it must be complete.The objectives that are covered, are covered in a very short and consise way, which is fine for a study guide, but is not enough if you really want to learn the topic."
2,More of a Review Book than Certification Guide,"This book was helpful as review, but not overly helpful as a start to finish guide."
2,Extremely Superficial,"I didn't find in this study guide, what I've expected (based on my experience with other study guides): (1)Precise explanations of the basic concepts, (2) Quizlets to test the important and hard to understand concepts, (3) Providing solid answers for the quizlets including the Why's and the Why Not's, (4)Concrete discussions of at least a few intricacies in each topic, (5)A thorough set of multiple choice questions at the end of each chapter, (6) A thorough explanation of the right and the wrong answers, (7)A Test Simulator CD, etc. The coverage of the topics and the multiple choice questions is ""very sketchy."""
2,Not that good as promised,"I strongly agree the comments put by a reader from Alameda, CA United States. Just replicated as below:This book has very little content in terms of J2EE itself. The title is very misleading - this cannot in itself be a study guide for the exam. To tell you truthfully, I am dissapointed with the book and would not recommend anyone to buy this book as anything more than a objectives refresher. This is an unbiased review - I am a software engineer planning to take the test in about a month. If you are planning to take this exam skip this book - it didn't help me much in my preparation and I'm sure you will be hearing the same from others who have bought this book."
3,Ok for the basics..,This is a good book to show you the basics for the exam. You will need to read the additional reading suggestons to be fully prepared.
3,Good Brief Review,"The book gives a good brief review on SECA objectives and iterates through each topic in the exam. At the end, there is a sample project for the preparation of part II of the exam.If you know J2EE very well, the book serves as quick overview to further enhance the knowledge or identify the weakness you have as regard to the exam. But if you are a less experienced developer/architect wishing to pass the exam, the book by itself is not enough."
3,Doesn't cover all the topics,"This book doesn't cover all the chapters.But the topics like security,design patterns,protocols,common architectures are very concise and clear.But you have to depend upon other materials for the other topics."
3,Don't trust this book,"Not everybody rates this book very highly (and so do I with 3 starts) I might as well take a different road. Granted the book is not a great one but I strongly recommend your buying if you want to have a quick understanding on what is all about J2EE architect exam.Well this book is not written for a new programmer, or someone with little knowledge of JSP and Servlets. It requires a solid experience on J2EE to understand the book content and samples. You will not guaranteed to pass the exam only by reading this book,"
3,"Good breadth and quite informative, but...",...you *absolutely* need to read a lot more in order to score well in the exam. The exam questions are trickier than what you'll find in this book.
3,Should include this book as one of your materials,"Hi,Why I give 3 stars is this book is not enough for the whole exam as they have missed legacy connectivity(this is really a vague topic and you really need help in this topic),messaging etc.I don't know whether the material for ejb is enough.But the material for security,Internationalization,protocols,design patterns,common architecture really tells what you should focus on. That is really good.For those chapters you really need this so that you don't have to break your head searching for material.Whatever material that is covered in this book is very concise.A real study guide you can say.But if they have covered all the topics I would have given 5 stars"
1,"Mistakes, errors, typos","Reading all the other reviews I just HAVE to warn everybody else about a big problem with this book: it's full of mistakes. Not just simple ones, but some fundamental ones as well. ONLY read this book to get an idea of what the exam will tell you, but get the real information somewhere else. The ""review questions"" were even worse. Many were more an exercise in your understanding of the english language than a question on the subject, especially those of chapter 2. But the most unforgivable mistake is a question where the answer starts with ""We can assume that..."". Pardon me? Anybody who calls himself an experienced architect knows Rule One: NEVER make assumptions. Making assumptions is the single most effective way of screwing up a project. To make a long story short, just read the index. That should help enough, and will at least not hurt you either."
3,"Good, but would like more....","Jam packed with information, but not a lot of elaboration for people new to the material."
2,Sun Certified Enterprise Architect for Java EE,"I have found errors in the chapter questions and haven't been able to find any link for errata, like some study guide books have. Errata links are useful to me to make corrections that others have found."
2,Thin and broad. Good for a review before the exam.,This book makes an assumption that the reader is already well prepared for the exam and all that needs to do be done is to summarize key points that might be useful in the exam. The book however lacks discussion on Messaging that is a considerable chunk of the exam.
1,Lost time,"I ordered a book, and after 2 weeks I got a message that the book could not be delivered because of my address?!? I used the same address all the time on any Web purchase and it is a regular house address. I had to buy the book from a different Web site."
3,the Title for the book is wrong,the name of the book should be Sun Certified Enterprise Architect for J2EE Technology Study Guide instead of Sun Certified Enterprise Architecture for J2EE Technology Study Guide.
5,Insightful as well as informative!,Patterson lays bare the most interesting period of AmericanHistory. His narrative is easily understood and at timesdownright entertaining. A must for history buffs and thosewho may not be too keen on the idea of reading history.
3,This was a bit of a disappointment..hard to get into,"I have read the entire oxford history of US and I must admit, this one didn't leave me too satisfied. I absolutely loved the whole series in it's entirety but the writing of this book was simply not up to the level of the others. I found myself wandering more and not getting into the storytelling like the other books. Let's face it, it was one of the most interesting times of our country but this book didn't do it justice. It would be fine if the other books in the series weren't so good but it should be at the same quality level."
5,Excellent! I highly recommend!,"Grand Expectations is a consice historical reader that informs you many fold. Taking into account the many arenas politics occurs this texts breathlessly illuminates the simultaneousness of domestic, international, cultural, and social affairs jungled during 1945 - 1974."
1,Sarah Palin would not approve,"This book is too biased against conservatives. If you love this country and believe in Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck, skip this book and stick with the Patriots History of the United States."
1,"Design change in the 10"" dual compound","Hello to those interested,I feel it necessary to alert those interested in purchasing the 10"" Hitachi dual compound saw. With my recent purchase and set up of this saw I was surprised to note the inability to compound to the left of any more than 30 degrees. With the addition of a tightening nut on the side of the chip guard which hits the fence when sliding!!! I believe this is an addition to the saw of recent months and may not be a problem on older models. I hope Hitachi will rectify this probblem ASAP.Sincerely,Richard W. Grieves d.b.a.Cape Shorew Woodworking"
5,Basic and Useful,"This book, although has been around a while, still maintains the basic concets needed to fix and repair a clock. Anythign beyhond this is proabably a manufactures questiosn anyway.It is great to have a reference tool, and as a quick review so as not ot forget the priciples of clock repair and building. A must have for any hobbyist."
5,well written and good graphics,"A good small book to help get one involved and beginning in old movement clock repair. Was beneficial in repairing two old mantel clocks and bringing them back to life, and helping a third party with the care of their 1800's pendulum wall hanger."
2,Not really much here,"Should be entitled ""Theory of Clocks,"" because there're only a dozen pages or so about how to make a repair. And the info there is like ""How to file a gear tooth."" Well, when are you supposed to do that?"
1,This book only give you a few notions- Libro superficial,"This is a very old book ( 1972 ? ) and have no much more thata hundred pages. Have only a little utility for teorical learning about old clocks. Today is practicaly useless.Este libro trata el tema de arreglar viejos relojes antiguos,aquellos de pared o repisa de forma muy superficial. Cuando seempieza a poner interesante se acaba el libro."
4,Youngish Robin Plays the Blues,This great instructional DVD is a great insight into the under-rated blues guitarist Robin Trower. And the best thing is ... Robin himself is doing the tutoring. Great examples of many of his licks and even a slow mo mode to help work out all his great fingering licks. Highly recommended for both Robin fans and guitar players in general.
5,Alot Of Fun From a Strat-Master,"This offering was made at a local studio in Atlanta...The live concert scenes were filmed at the Center Stage Theatre in Midtown Atlanta in and around the late 80's where Robin was making his full fledged comeback, touring the US every year without stop....His currant touring band today is the same band he used then with Davey Pattison, Glenn Letsch, and Pete Thompson...Trower's unique approach mostly involved his use of a dirty blues over-driven signal through a Uni-Vibe, giving him a overwhelmingly ""Big"" guitar sound: then using odd slow-paced chording, mysterious lyrics, and impassioned leads drawn from his ax that showed thru his facial expressions.....Robin touches alot about his blues and R & B influences in his playing also....As well as his amp settings, tone controls and gear....All is included....All this coming from a well reserved man who obviously doesn't like talking about himself...Highly recommended viewing."
3,Good for a laugh.,I like Robin as much as Hendrix. It is so funny to watch Robin try to explain why he has the magic. He takes very simple riffs and techniques and makes them magic. You can't teach this stuff but good to watch for any guitar playing fan. Don't exect to learn much though. You either got the touch or you don;t.
1,Cable broke my firewire connector,I have a sony Video camera. To get the video off of the camera I bought this firewore cable. It bent the pins on the connector on the video camera. I had to buy another VC to put the DV tapes in to get the video into my computer. I bought a different cable for that camera.
5,Quality built Schumacher PSC 2030T charger good deal,"Heavy duty charger, very well built. I enthusiastically recommend. Simple design without all the bells and whistles that can break later down the line. This one looks like it will last 20 years easy."
4,Very Large,"Much larger then i realized, so will use it for a plant, or something on the deck. Not what I had originally purchsed for. But was deliver quickly."
5,Hummingbirds have a feeder,Exactly what I needed to hang my hummingbird feeder (from a metal fence). Strong and adjustable -- just what was needed.
3,Depends on how the deck railing is finished,"This is a sturdy product and is nice enough. It's probably only my deck, but this will not fit on the railing without adding (read: hammering) a post into the deck to hold it."
4,Bird Feeder Deck Hook,This deck hook is angled perfectly to hold my bird feeders. It is also pretty sturdy and looks like it will hold up this winter..
3,Only one flaw,"I like this product for use on our deck, the only flaw is the clap that holds it onto the deck needs to be wider in order to fit a 4x4 railing and the screw needs to be more compact. I would definitely recommend to anyone with a railing 1-2"" thick."
1,Don't buy this product,"Do not buy this product. The drawers arrived all jammed up and the stops were broken off the back so the drawers would slide all the way through and fall out. The cord management system is just a couple of cheap plastic clips - worthless. The size was fine and the colors were as expected, but the middle of the shelf sagged with the weight of a standard printer - don't buy this."
3,Where is the DVD?,"Since I own last year edition, which came complete with the dvd I was disappointed to see that this didnt have one.Seeing all of the ads on the dvd and all of the stuff (flash files from the web, etc.) It was really not a good move not to include one with this edition. Especially since it still states that dvd is included on book description page. Someone should change that.It would be great selection of adds otherwise..."
3,Thoughtful Music,Despite being a good smooth jazz CD one was of the opinion that it lacked a measure of energy associated with his earlier material.
3,Still lost,Well at least this one is not as bad as the last. Stay Awhile is one of my favorites but all four CDs afterwards including True shows that Steve Cole has lost his soul. The strongest songs in Stay Awhile are the ballads but Cole has not produced a song yet in the next four CDs worthy of being included in that first CD. The selections in True are pleasant enough but are nothing exceptional. There is only one pedestrian ballad and that doesn't come until the 9th cut. Sure some people are going to rave over this CD. But that's only because the last one was so awful.
2,Be prepared to spend more than $600.,"I've been looking for a Sheraton II for several months. I've tried out at least 15-20 in several music stores and Guitar Centers. I've found three common problems: The China made Sheraton II's do not stay in tune, the volume/tone knobs and pots are of poor quality and the frets feel rough when you bend a note. I recently found a 2004 model made in Korea and the quality of this instrument is amazing. I would say that if you plan to buy a China made Sheraton that you be ready to put another $100-200 into it to make it playable. That or try to find a used Korean made one in good condition. You will get yourself a quality guitar with great tone and sustain for half the $600 price of a new one."
5,mmm yummy,"isn't she hot?!?!?! i don't have her, but she is lovely and plays like a dream. like a beautiful dream about that hot guy or gal you just can't out of your head.-Ben"
5,Best of the series - superb!,Great for teaching the little ones French - they really pay attention to this CD!
5,2003 Malibu Radio Harness,Hard to find the right connector. The pic didn't tell me enough. The description wasn't clear. Ended up being the right part. Thank You.
2,Wrong product! !!!,"This harness came on time and in good condition, but it did not fit my car 2008 chevy express even the seller says it is right product.Be aware and double check if you have newer year GM car. If there are 2 small harnesses going to your original radio this one will not fit for sure. Good luck"
3,Not required if you purchase chime retention device,"I purchased this item when installing a Clarion double din head unit in a 2008 Trailblazer. I also purchased a chime retention device. Thank goodness this was a very inexpensive item, as it is sitting on my workbench. The GM chime retention device came with its own wiring harness, that had been modified to include the connection to the retention device itself. Had I not wanted to retain the chimes, this would have worked fine."
1,Does not work on 04 cavalier,"Tried to install on an 04 cavalier, the pins do not match up to stock harness thus making useless. Trying to pull the pins out only breaks them, look elsewhere."
1,Didn't work at all.,It said this product would work for my 2005 impala. Didn't work at all. some of the pins didn't even line up and there wasn't even a wire for the factory amp in the trunk.
1,Not for GMC 2008 Sierra,Does not fit the 2008 GMC Sierra 1500. No where near what is needed. Absolutely a waste of time. Look else where.
4,Metra harness 70-2003,"This harness worked like a charm for me on my 2004 GMC Sierra.Buying the right harness is confusing with the many offered, my advice is before you purchase its best to know how many (count them) pin's are on your present factory stock harness radio connector plug and buy the same number of pins listed for the after market connector.When you use this type of harness, you can expect to lose some of your factory warning chimes,like door-ajar,parking brake warning chime.The product worked great for me and the shipping was fast. If you want to keep all the original factory chimes, then you will pay dearly for those harness's. Remember to count the pins first before you order to save yourself the frustration and waste of your time."
1,does not work with Chevy S10 pickups,"This would be a great product if they sent the correct part. Instead it is listed incorrectly, and I'm out $5 with no stereo. LAME."
1,Didn't fit,"didn't fit my 1999 Chevy Lumina, completely wrong, not even close. They labeled it that it fits GM 98 and up and I was stupid enough to fall for it KNOWING that GM used different connectors across different vehicles. I have no idea what it will plug up to but it's definitely not the radio of my car.... 1 star"
1,Not for 2004 Pontiac Vibe!,"This was said to be compatible with the 2004 Pontiac Vibe, but IT IS NOT. The harness plugs in perfectly. However, by looking at the pins of the harness itself, you can tell the pins on the Metra don't match up to the pins of the harness from the car as if it is meant for a different car.I didn't want to bother dissembling the harness to move the pins around so I just went ahead and bought a different harness from Carxtc, that one should work since someone left a review saying it worked on their 2003 vibe."
5,"meh, I messed up",If your need wiring harness for Suburbans 98 and up this product may not be the right one for you. I didnt research enough and found another metra product also for GM models that DOES fit my suburban..... so Dont rely on the product description or automatic product finder... do more research before buying things like this. Other than that with the quality and price here you cant go wrong... well I guess I did but whatever.
2,It didn't work for me,"I'm a fan of Chanticleer. I like their ability to sing so many styles of music well. I like their musical savvy. This recording just struck me as a knock-off. ""Let's do some Broadway Hits and see how it turns out."" I have no real qualm with falsetto singing or countertenors; I generally like them if they are appropriate for the music. However, the sopranos of Broadway are generally female and as such have a totally different tone than a male falsetto or countertenor. The music that was written for Broadway (whether for male or female voice)requires a tone quality that is fuller and generally more ""gutsy"" than a falsetto or countertenor can provide. I felt the pieces which should have heart and soul were just insipid.Sorry guys, but it did not work for me. I gave this recording away. I would never consider doing that with any of my other Chanticleer recordings. The ensemble was up to its usual technical form, however."
4,Be the star of your own Astaire/Rogers movie!,"I have to admit that on the first playing, I didn't like this CD much. After subsequent playings, however, the perceived incongruity of the instruments augmenting the already full orchestra that is Chanticleer began to vanish. I have even gone through that addiction phase I always get when I buy a REALLY GOOD CD. Now I do the foxtrot through my living room while playing ""It's De-Lovely"" and ""Night and Day"" really LOUD and imagining my partner is Astaire instead of just air."
4,Nice Ramekin,"These are very nice looking Ramekins. They are also solid. I purchased initially to make creme brulee in. The seven ounce size is a good for the creme brulee. Since this is a deeper dish you will need to cook the creme brulee longer than a very shallow dish. I actually purchased these off ebay, turns out from the same seller here on Amazon ""pricebully"" they were less expensive on ebay and featured free shipping which is always nice. I am sure I will use these for other things like dip for chips. Overall very good looking ramekins, much more character than the basic white ramekin."
4,Nice,"Beautiful colors and shape. The red is great. Turned out to be a bit smaller than I was expecting and somewhat impractical for many uses, but live and learn. Great, however, for portion control for high-calorie dishes."
4,Special Interests Prevail,"Very enlightening historical perspective on national health insurance. It seems special interests dominant in our democratic society. Quite surprising that both republican & democratic presidents tried to pass national health insurance. Special interests contribute to both parties and when the going gets close focus on those candidates who are vulnerable in order to entice their vote.In our current lack of bi-partisian political climate, it seems very doubtful that national health insurance has a chance of being passed."
4,Good supplement to Daschle's book,"Much more detailed and thematic than Critical, Tom Daschle's survey of healthcare reform and brief policy presentation, this book is still very readable and is necessary for anyone who really wants to follow the battle. It is well organized and the themes are well supported, but the writing is occasionally unclear."
2,Some of them overheat!,"I originally bought three hubs for three computers: 2 IMACs and a PC. As a previous reviewer reported I had a problem with overheating on one connected to an IMAC. I purchased another for the IMAC and it worked fine for a couple of months, and then it overheated and no longer functioned. The two connected to the other IMAC and the PC still seem to be working OK!?"
2,Over Priced!!!!!!!!,Its cheaply made. The connectivity is unreliable- any budge of your laptop will make this thing disconnect.I think most hubs come with 220v compatability so its no special trait here.
2,Not my cup of tea,"The book is nothing more than a class room primer.Some chord forms are illustrated, but unless you can read music, you can't really do anything withthe forms given, and If you can read music, you probably don't need this book, and if you can read music, you won't want to play these lame songs.there are 10 photos of someone (I assume it is Mel Bay) showing proper finger position on the fretboard. The operative word here is PROPER, as, if you look closely, there is no way he is pressing on some of the strings shownon the actual chord form graphic but I assume he is doing this to show proper hand/finger position even if itdoes not really get the job done.Books like this P..s me off, as I already have to many of them taking up space!"
3,No problem,"The producet arrived on time, it cleaned the head, but it did not resolve our problem. This has nothing to do with the quality of the cleaning tape."
4,The Last American,"For a book that was written in 1889 it certainly seems to have a lot of parallels to what is going on now. Granted it's a satire of what happened to the ""Mehrikans"" set in the distant future, but well worth the read nonetheless."
4,"Redwall Journal Attractive, yet a Bit Disappointing","Brian Jacques's books have long been popular with young readers, incluidng myself. Now he invites fans to become the Recorder of Redwall Abbey themselves with this journal, and encourages readers to write about secret thoughts and dreams for ""you are the recorder now.""While this is a welcome treat from Jacques's and a fun insperation to start writing, the journal is spiral bound and not of the best quality..."
3,"Good for collectors, but overpriced for a toy","This doll could be improved if the weapons made some noise, and although more poseable than the Vader figure, it's still not that durable. The price for what you get, in my opinion, is way too much. I wouldn't pay more than seven dollars for it."
2,NEW REMASTER AVAILABLE FOR A LOT LESS MONEY,"A UK record company, BGO, that specializes in remastered reissues has released a newly mastered 2CD edition ofLittle Robbers, backed with ""All Four One"" (the expandedCapitol editionreleased in the late 90's, also newly mastered).That set, with two albums and bonus tracks, is far less money, new, than the prices this old, tired, non-remastered single-album disc is being hawked for, used, here on Amazon.For audiophiles, BGO respects the dynamic range of the original Robbers LP, whereas most of the Capitol Motels' ""best of's"" have terrible loudness compression present (The Essential CollectionandClassic Masters, the latter being REALLY bad)."
4,Ah the memories!,"I came of age during the 1980s and The Motels are part of the ""soundtrack of my life."" I used to hear ""Only The Lonely"" (the track that put them on the map, in my opinion), ""Suddenly Last Summer,"" and ""Remember The Nights"" on pop radio and they've been on my ""favorites list"" ever since.I got ""Little Robbers"" because it had two out of the three of my favorites, and I liked a couple of the other samples I heard on here.Of the titles on this CD, ""Remember the Nights"" is my favorite! It's energetic, and colorful, telling wistfully of wonderful, romantic getaways.After listening to the CD, I also came to like ""Where Do We Go From Here,"" and ""Monday Shut Down"" (which apparently doesn't exist on any other Motels CD).The title track, ""Little Robbers"" is a playful party tune and it's enjoyable.All in all I liked half the tracks on this album, which isn't bad."
4,Little Robbers--The Motels,"Wow, what a cool band The Motels was! I remember seeing them at Irvine Meadows Amplitheater in 1983. The stage was dark, and then the band all jumped out from behind cardboard cut-outs of each other! The band was so on, it sounded just like my cassette tape! They played the best 5 songs on the album--Suddenly Last Summer, Trust Me, Remember The Nights, Little Robbers, and my favorite--Into The Heartland...I recommend it for all Motel fans. Thanks for a great concert!"
3,"Good, not great","Good book but not as in depth as I had hoped. Martin Edge's book is still my favorite, looking forward to the fourth edition."
4,Beautiful ideas for photos,"But this is mostly in Micronesia, Great Barrier and Red Sea, not much in Caribbean, however excellent info and worthwhile for the underwater photographing enthusiast."
3,Eh Ok,"I thought since I paid for the most exspensive water gun on amazon it would be a pretty cool one. I wasn't so happy, it was very mediocre, nothing spectacular about it all. Kind of hard even for a 7yr old to pump and water doesn't last that long."
2,Never Judge a Super Soaker by the Box,"The Vaporizer is a piston-style water gun, so you need considerable muscle in order to fire more than 5 shots. Also, the pump is hard to push, so by the time you get off a burst, your opponent (even if he/she is using a pistol) has shot you about 3 times, and then run off. The only good things about it was that it was easy to reload and had some capacity.-By his son (anonymous)"
5,"Fun mix of cyber hacking, scifi, and sword-and-sorcery","""True names"", predates this pseudonymous age, by twenty years, but it seems remarkably current. Vinge, predicts and anticipates a lot of technology, and I am looking forward to neural browsers! Perhaps more important, is the ethical question of whether one that avoids the temptation of self interest, should be trusted .. indefinitely, even if in a non-physical form? There is some talk about making this into a film, so that would be exciting!The ""Apprentice"" is perhaps most significant for its collaboration, with then wife, Joan Vinge. The piece ""The Ungoverned"", is the connection between ""The Peace War"" and ""Marooned in real time"" (the ""Across realtime"" edition includes that story). Vinge's introductions are a delight in themselves, and the way he approaches ""the singularity"" (a particular state of technological self awareness) from different angles is thought provoking."
4,A nice after dinner mint to Neuromancer,"While I felt this book to be of sufficient interest to mention, I have reservations. I must say that its an easy read . The subject matter has been done before, but this vision into our future is unique, and well worth reading if you can manage to get a copy of this book. Thanks, Verno"
2,No Proper Ejection of Wood Chips,"I bought this bit recently and used it for a job I did as an Electrician. There are a couple of negative points I would like to point out. First, while drilling, the wood chips would not properly leave the bit and would get stuck in the groove and eventually friction would cause smoke to come out where you are drilling. Also, because the wood chips would get stuck on the bit I had to pull it out after only drilling through half the stud to clean it out to finish the hole and then had to clean it out after I drilled through completely so I could start the next stud. It made for a very time consuming endeavor and I was not a very happy customer. I will be purchasing the Milwaukee 1"" Self-Feed bit and will test how well that compares to this."
3,"Technically impressive, but unrefined","Nakariakov ranks among the best as far as technically demanding riffs and amazing tonguing speed go, but his sound is not refined enough to warrant an excellent rating. He sometimes has pitch problems, and his tone is often somewhat flat. While I enjoy his interpretation of the Neruda, I think superior recordings can be found of the other pieces (try Maurice Andre for the Vivaldi; in his recording the violin and trumpet play off each other beautifully). Give this guy time though, he's a young player."
3,Disappointed,This toy is more of a nostalgic collector's piece. It is heavy & unmaneuverable. It'll go straight but doesn't really turn. Keep it indoors or the bright shiny surface will quickly become dull and faded. I guess the best part is the little squeeker horn. Still ... the boys (now 18 & 20 mos) sit on it all the time and have learned to make it go with their feet on the patio outside. Most of the time they sit on it and push the button (horn) to make it toot! If I had to do it over again - I wouldn't buy this toy!
3,Not a great ride-on,"My daughter likes to ride on this car and beep the horn, but we only use it inside. I tried taking her outside on it once, but it is so unmaneuverable that I gave up. Radio Flyer seems to be good at wagons, not so good with other wheeled toys (a friend has a Radio Flyer tricycle that is top heavy and tips over constantly.)"
4,Built like toys should be,"I purchased the Radio Flyer Roadster for my grandson's first birthday. By the end of the party, he had learned how to go forwards and backwards. He loved the easy-to-push beep-beep horn. The Roadster is built with the Radio Flyer quality of old and will probably last into the next generation. They just don't make toys like this much anymore...no huge day-glo plastic monster...just a little piece of yesterday that will last a lifetime."
2,Do not buy,Although it is as cute as can be.. it is very heavy and hard for little ones to play with. It is a great display piece...made very well.
1,Heavy & really hard to steer! Skip it!,"My very coordinated then 18-mo old twin boys were so excited to get this roadster, but that quickly faded into frustration. Even now, at 2-years of age, they get so annoyed by this car. It barely turns (really short turning radius), and is also difficult to steer. It's too heavy to use their weight (30lbs each) to manipulate it, so they end up hitting dead ends (walls, door jams, etc.). Skip this toy! It is in major need of modernization. I would recommend another ride-on toy instead. At our house, the very sturdy, not as heavy ""New Bobby Car"" is a big hit. The roadster may be beautiful to look at, but it's simply not functional."
1,Poorly constructed and designed toy,"This toy is poorly constructed and designed unlike many other Radio Flyer classics. It smells like a chemical factory coming out of the box for one. Secondly, as many stated in other reviews, the turning radius is awful and makes it virtually un-maneuverable. All four wheels were wobbly and the whole thing had a cheap feel to it. Its a slick looking toy but thats about it."
2,Hard to turn,"My husband bought this for our son's 1st birthday and he wasn't interested in it. It states that it is for 12 months and up so I figured maybe we just needed to wait a bit. Well, he is now 18 months and has on a few occasions gotten onto the roadster to try it out...but he is then easily bored with it because he can only go straight. He'll soon run into whatever is in his way and can't turn it so he'll get off. Even if I go alongside next to him to try to turn it for him, it's hard. One of the features that I will look for in his NEXT ride-on toy will be ""manuervability""."
1,great toy,Bought this for my grandson .This is such a great little car very sturdy and easy to put together. This is made out of metal and not plastic.
2,Rubber wheels smell funny,"We purchased this for my son, he hasn't got much use out of it since it resides in my parent's attic due to the never ending stench (of rubber I guess) from the wheels. We can't keep this in our home, so I hope he will use it more this coming summer outdoors. The trick is to make sure you get the wheel caps on right. I hammered the heck out of them against a stone surface on the opposite side, and they still aren't perfectly flush causing some wobble. There has got to be a better way to secure a wheel on all these types of toys."
4,excellent beginner's guide to soccer,Easy to read and understand. Good pictures. Very helpful if you have never coached before or just want to improve your knowledge of coaching.
4,Good starting place,"I was asked to help coach my daughter's soccer team--a first for both of us. Not knowing where to start, this is what helped me get going. Good material on motivations and drills, etc. Definitely what I needed."
1,Bad sound quality,"Everything was fine except when I talked, the person I was talking to heard a humming noise. When I stopped talking, the humming noise stopped. Needless to say I took it back for a refund and bought another brand of phone.I am sick of products that don't work acceptably!"
3,not the size they say,"Although my two years olds love the magenta and blues stuffed animal, it is not the size they advertise. I purposefully bought the medium size (not the 4"" but the 8"") and it is very small- definately not 8"". But the kids don't know the difference and my daughter carries magenta around everywhere!"
5,Darling little Magenta!,"My grandaughter, 2, is in love with Blue's Clues. She loves these beanie baby Blue's items. These are very well made, sturdy, and cute as can be!!"
3,It's ok.,"I have a little boy, so it's not like he is into dolls or stuffed animals but some he will take to. This was not one of them. He thought it was cool that we had the whole Blue, Magenta and Spinkles gang, but that was about it. Unless your child really enjoys and wants to play with it, it may be left in a bin or on th shelf. This would be adorable to use as a part of decorting a child's room."
5,More than just a drill,"I purchased this tool for drilling holes in concret, and I started using it for a demolition tool for busting up concret to install conduit, fence post etc. I'm very satisfied with the overall performance of this tool."
5,Great Puzzle!,"This is a great puzzle. It isn't too easy, but it isn't too hard. It's also fun to see favorite characters start to come together when you're putting the pieces together. It is a huge puzzle! 2ft. by 3ft., so you have to have a table large enough for it. The pieces have foam backing, so they stay together fairly well, even if you lift up a large portion that is stuck together. This was designed so you could use the puzzle as a poster, but it is quite handy when putting the puzzle together. You can move chunks of pieces to wherever you need them."
3,What?,"What? This product is NOT what is showed in the photo. Instead of the box of Xtra Sour Goo which was shown, I recieved Monster Goo, which is NOT what I wanted to get. This company does not send you exactly what is in the photo, so watch out."
5,A very funny book about life. From a teenage perspective.,I have found while sitting in the Grishaver living room that this is a great way to waste and more importantly take up time. I do recommend this book to people that ask me a good bathroom book and to any one who enjoys a chuckle.
5,amtrak beauty,pictures on line don*t do this piece justice....the graphics are so crisp and clear..I was pleasantly surprised that it ran ok on a regular 36 inch circular brachman track without derailing....hangs over a little just like the prototype car..the lighting is just barely visible...I took the shell off and replaced the bulbs with bigger ones and pulled the bigger bulbs up through the base....also added a big bulb to illuminate the lower lounge...the changes are now visible daylight and evening ..the length of the car running on the track makes a clickety clack sound just like real unwelded track...all in all a real treat to watch behind a silver trim diesel....
5,Amtrak passenger car,Love this! It has good lighting inside the car and you can see the seats through the windows as it passes by. Delivered very fast and in sturdy box.
1,Hard Vice - not so hard not so anything,"Shannon Tweed, only semi good in her own brand of softer adult films. In this movie she plays a cop trying to catch a killer that goes out at night as a call girl and kills the men who pay her to give them a good time. Don't waste your money on this one, its not worth it!"
4,School shoes,"My daughter enjoys being able to slip on and off these shoes. They fit well even though she has a narrow foot. I gave these shoes 4 stars because the top and sides you see in white are made of a soft mesh material- I would prefer them made of something more durable, like leather. But so far so good, no rips or tears yet. Overall a good shoe."
5,The American Battle Royale,"Any fan of Battle Royale, or anyone who enjoys dark, cynical, anti-pop culture humor will truly appreciate the Series 7 take on a brutal blood-sport-turned-reality TV. I wish there was a Series 8 and I wish there was a DVD!"
1,Doesn't work,We bought this spray to help keep our cats calm during travel. They took one sniff and weren't impressed. They screamed the whole way so product certainly didn't help. Don't buy this stuff.
2,Don't Waste Your $$,It came in a plastic envelope. Half of it had squirted out. I used it in my cat's kennel; and it did not calm him down a bit. No behavior change in any of my cats.
4,"So far, so good!","Will check back with more review over an extended period of time. Have a kitty who dances before sleep, usually for an extended period of time. Get up / turn over / make the slightest move in the middle of the night and she's at it again. I'm a softie cat dad so there's no way I'm kicking her out of the bed. Last night was the first try with At Ease, she settled down with only a short dance, and re-settled through the course of the night with NO dancing. Just sprayed a little on the comforter & wiped off the excess spray. Bought this as a less expensive alternative to Feliway."
4,Makes Kitties Come Out!,"I sprayed a bit of this stuff before I had guests over (just 2 spritzes), and lo and behold, my most shyest cat came out right away to greet them! He hasn't done that since he was a kitten, a few years. And then my other cat came out to join him, and she had been shying away as of late. I had to tell my guests about my miracle product because some have not seen my shyest cat in years. My cats are usually hiding when anyone comes over. Not only that, but they soon both went around and sniffed my guests, and allowed themselves to be petted. That's unheard of! Now I spray each time someone comes over and my cats are much friendlier.I actually got this to calm my kitties before taking them to the vet, which didn't work out. But I'm happy with the other advantage. And this is something I can afford vs Feliway."
5,Best Recording of Faune,"I am a professional flutist, and this is the best recording of Prelude a l'apres midi d'une faune that I have heard. Of course, Jeanne Baxtresser's performance (flute) is flawless and musical. The CD is very well recorded, and each piece is performed impeccably and with the highest artistry. In my opinion, this CD sets the standard for these works. Buy it!"
1,New York Music and Movies,"I can't review this album since it hasn't been sent to me. I ordered it on Nov. 30 and here it is Dec. 24. No album! The music may be good (Iwouldn't know0, but avoid ordering from New York Music and Movies. They can't handle it!"
3,Half and Half,"About half of this CD is really good and the other half is not. The Prelude is very good as are La Valse and Bolero. This recording brings out much of the inner detail in those peices that other recordings may miss. The saxophone peice was not very interesting. La Mer was porly interpreted and very unexciting. La Mer does have some beautiful moments though. For example, the trumpet solo at the beginning of the Dialogue is exceptionally well played."
1,You will be better off not buying this book,"I was more than disappointed with this flimsy and rather ""sad"" book. It is filled with nothing much more than trashy and ""cutesy"" sayings which do no justice to the English language. Quite possibly the most repeated word in this book is onomatopoeic and it's a pity a suitable descriptive phrase for ""don't buy this book"" is not blazoned all over the front cover."
2,Panasonic KX-TG1034S,"This product got good reviews so we bought it. Sadly, the range is very short, signal is lost even when standing near the base...very frustrating. When the phone rings, it is often continuous more like an alarm. We are very disappointed in the product."
4,Just as good as I expected,"I have this same technology ..for the last 5 years with a 2-handset model. It was, therefore, a breeze to adjust to the new one.. no learning curve..While I don't perceive any significant improvements except for the clarity on the outgoing message.., I was very very satisfied for years with the original..so perhaps no improvements were needed ! I can communicate with the other handsets.. there is always a phone where I need one now.., before I was always up and down the stairs looking for the phone.. I wished I'd bought this sooner. what a great price and value Don't know about the battery life but the old one was good...Thanks Panasonic"
4,Panasonic Cordless Phones,"I would give this product a solid 5-star rating were it not for the multi-step process required to delete stored incoming call numbers from the phone's memory. It also has a propensity to label any incoming call as a missed call whether it is missed or not. Otherwise, we're completely satisfied."
5,"panasonic, good phone","the product is simple to use and got it to replace previous panasonic. always happy with the brand when it comes to phones. when somebody calls and answering machine picks up, you can hear the caller's message on any one of phones, not just main base. battery life great, although phone brand new! would recommend this to anybody, can't find any faults with product so far."
5,Great Phone System,A great system!! Easy to set up and works as well as a wired land line.I bought it to use with a new VOIP system and it works better than expected.
2,really disappointed,"Just bought the KX-TG1034S and will take it back tomorrow. After carefully reading all reviews I thought this would be the best cordless phone to purchase. I have had a Uniden TRU phone for several years and enjoyed the clarity of voice and no interference.This new phone was a problem with the first call I've made. There is a constant background noise before the call even connected. It only got worse once I started talking. I've tried everything, moved the base all over my small home; lowered the volume (that made it better - but I couldn't hear without straining) without success. Too bad because I like the way the handset feels and the larger buttons are great. Wished it would have worked out."
5,Panasonic cordless phone,Phones work great. Love being able to put a phone where I do not have a phone jack.
3,Sound cuts out while talking,I liked everything about the phone EXCEPT when I was talking I could not hear myself through the phone. The other party had no trouble and I could always hear them. But it was annoying. I took it back and I was told by a sales person that the DECT 6.0 phones have a noise suppressant built in to eliminate the echo some have complained about and the trade off is this...Also 50 number memory is a bit low. AND the sound does not get loud enough for anyone with even a slight impairment. Certainly not up to the usual Panasonic Quality. Panasonic was less than helpful and I took it back to where I bought it.
1,Piece of junk!,"I'm not just going to throw these phones away, I'm going to give myself the satisfaction of smashing them to pieces before I do. This thing drops calls left and right, even if I'm standing next to the base. At any given time I can pick one of these units and it's not getting a signal. Don't buy this under any circumstances."
3,"1st attempt at this product failed, trying 2nd phone",I 1st phone was not operatonal after several attempts to correct problems. This is the second phone and at this time I cannot comment on it's operation since I'm still waiting for the batteries to charge so I can complete the setup of the phone.
4,So Far So Good!!,"I have had the product only for 2 weeks, I love the sound quality. No issues so far, my 2 year old dropped the hand set once and inspite of that I have had no issues with the product.I am giving 4 stars because I need more time to evaluate the product.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LYCUF8/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
1,Panasonic KX-TG1034S Dect 6 cordless Phone System,Not happy with this product. Researched this product before buying----marketing and advertising greatly exaggerated!! Data stated it had a working range up to 2000ft. Lucky it works room to room!!Look around before you buy!
1,Lousy phone,Slow to get here. They don't work half the time.They die in the middle of calls.DO NOT BUY THIS.
3,Not all they're cracked up to be,"I'm really not all that satisfied, but can't seem to change my reviewer name.The Panasonic DECT phones have nice features, but very poor range; worse than my oldest 900 mHz phone. I replaced a Siemens 2.4 gHz system with the Panasonic DECT 6.0, expecting improved range. Not.One of the features I most wanted to use, the intercom/call handoff to other handsets in the house, cannot be used because of the poor range issue.I do like having a speakerphone in each handset, the clarity of the transmission (when in range), the sharing of the phone book among handsets.In short, only an OK system; nothing to get excited about."
1,Lousy customer service,"I ordered a new version of this phone system and they arrived promptly. However one of the 4 phones didn't work. So I called customer service and they told me to send it back to them at my expense. I therefore had to pay for the box, go to the PO and pay to ship it. NOT GREAT but ok, sorta, but not really. I paid what I paid for working phones, not mostly working plus extra postage and time. Then after a week or so they send me back a replacement model. BUT THE UNIT WAS A REBUILT UNIT, NOT NEW! I didn't pay for rebuilt. I payed for NEW. I didn't get what I paid for, namely 4 new phones that work, I got for additional time, money and hassle, 3 new phones and 1 rebuilt phone. I called them again and they said, sorry, that all we have. No offer to reimburse me for postage, not offer to make it better. Just sorry. Well me too!Panasonic, you failed at basic customer relations. For a few bucks you made an enemy. Kinda expensive if you ask me."
3,Panasonphone,We bought this set when our other set was having problems. I do not like the caller ID on this phone to go back and see who may have called while you were out is a pain to figure out and the phone takes a while to show the number calling. Other then that it is okay.
1,Range is terrible,I just bought this phone for my house. Range is terrible. It breaks up 30 feet away from the base. Very disappointing. I will now have to return.
1,Panasonic cordless phones,"Only four of the phones work! Did not send back because the four that work are good, but irritated that 2 won't work with the set. Ad should read : 4 phone set & 2 others (door stops?)."
5,Bouhgt 3 and extremly satisfied,The product is excellentNo background noisesexcellent rangeBought already 3 of those
4,Performs well. Some pleasant surprises. Poor wall mount.,"System performs as described. Large keypad and clear display text appreciated. The system allows one handset to be programmed with all the frequently used telephone numbers and then the unit can update remaining units with those memorized numbers. Computer wireless network is unaffected by the phone wireless network.The provided wall mount is the only serious flaw. The mount projects 6 inches horizontally from the wall! I trimmed to a 3.5 inch projection with the use of a Dremel tool and modeler's glue.Now into 4th month, did have to replace one pair of AAA rechargeable batteries"
4,Panasonic Dect 6.0 PHone System,Good phone system. Very impressed with the range and style. Was hoping that the internal phone book would have been universal (visible from all phones) and also could have quicker access to voice mail buttons and clearing of old CID's. Overall I've been very happy with it.
4,"Good phone, easy to use and nice ringer options","We purchased these phones about a month ago, and they are working well. A breeze to set up, we now have 4 phones in the house (even one in the basement) without any hassle.A plus are the ringers - we have our's set currently to ""Jingle Bells"" and it is a nice reminder of the Christmas season. Plus, the kids perk up every time the phone rings!"
4,Panasonic KX-TG1034S Dect 6.0 Expandable handset phones.,"Enough has been written about these phones. For the most part these are a nice set of phones. I am just going to give the negatives.1. No volume control. 99 percent of the time the volume is fine. But...2. No lit keypad. What? Not a big deal to me, but come on.....3. They managed to goof up the caller ID menu on this phone. Some of it is better than the earlier phones like these, some of it is stupid. The caller ID does display when the calls come in, but if you want to go into the caller ID and see who might have called earlier, well grrrrrThere is one positive that is nice, these phones use just regular rechargeable AAA NIMH batteries, no more hunting for special batteries for your phones."
4,Panasonic Kx-TG1034s,Read a review on this phone in consumer reports. The phone was easy to set up and has large number buttons which make it easy to use. Accessing the caller Id and phone book could be easier to access but will just take time to get use to the programing the display is easy to read and phone fits nice into your hand. Over all pleased with the purchase.
4,Off to a good start,"Some Panasonic products I've bought over the years have been mediocre, others excellent. This phone system, so far, falls into the ""excellent"" category.Easy to set up, great range from the base to locations throughout the house (2 floors) and out in the yard. The speakerphone on the handsets is very good - especially important to me as I am somewhat hard of hearing and don't like putting a phone to my ear when wearing a hearing aid."
2,"I can,t hear you.",This is a very nice phone with a major flaw. The volume is way too low and can not be increased nearly enough.
1,No backlit keypad,"This phone has a major flaw right out the box - the keypad does not light up at all, only the display does. I sent it back right away, so cannot comment on any other features (for me this was a fatal flaw)"
4,cordless phone system,"Phones are light, have a clip for your belt which is handy if you use a headset. I like them. Come with batteries ready to install. I have an extension in most rooms of the house, since the phones disappear with two kids in the house.Panasonic Dect 6.0 Series 4 Handset Cordless Phone System with Answering System (KX-TG1034S)"
1,Panasonic DECT 6 - KX-TG1034S,sometimes it would not connect to the base station from my bedroom and voices on the other end would fade in and fade out. i returned it.
4,Jim's Opinioon,i TRIED TO ESTABLISH THAT i AM REPORTING ON PANASONIC KX-10334S DET 6 CORDLESS PHONE. tHIS WAS NOT ACCEPTED BY YOU.Anyway the phone would rate a 4 our out of 5. The audio is somewhat weak and should be improved. The ability to have 50 phone numbers is very useful. Overall the phone does it's job but impresses me as being a bit on the cheap side.Jim Sutton
3,"Overall easy to use, but not enough volume.","This review is for this class of phones with the 2-handset package. In general, the phone is easy to use; the voicemail works well and the phone book and other options are easily accessable. However, we live in a rural area, and hearing callers on the other end can be a problem due to low volume. In all of our calls, people on the other end said they could hear us well, even when we used non-panasonic branded headsets. We are returning the phones because they do not have enough amplification; turning up the volume all the way results in calls that are barely audible in cases. We have owned other wired and cordless phones that amplify the incoming signal sufficiently. For those of you who have phone service that is not up to snuff in terms of volume, I would recommend avoiding this family of phones."
5,Excellent Cordless Set,"I've had many cordless phones over the years, but this Panasonic set is undoubtedly the one that has actually exceeded my expectations. The range and clarity are outstanding. My laptop hasn't dropped offline once while I've had these phones. It used to drop off regularly. I'm totally satisfied and think this phone set is an excellent value."
1,Terrible phone,I was excited to have gotten this phone. The 4 headsets were exactly what my house needed. Overall the phone is decent- but because of the short range it is the worst phone I have ever had!! The phone will just shut off and start beeping during a call indicating that you are too far away from the base. This even happens when I am in the same room as the base. If being cut off in the middle of a conversation is OK with you for no apparent reason- then this is the phone you should have!!!
3,Panasonic Dect 6.0 Digital Phone,"Overall, the phone is good with a few items that I do not like.1. When talking sometimes it seems as though you lost the call.2. When someone leaves a message, it can be heard on all handsets.3. It is hard to erase all calls at once.4. Using the phone book feature and dailing takes forever to call.5. What I hate the most, no light when you answer the phone. At night, this is terrible.I like the phone OK but I wish I would have researched more phones before purchasing this one. I don't think I would buy it again."
1,Short range and call cut offs,I was very excited to try this 6.0 phone. I have an old house with thick walls and wireless set up throughout so the fact that this phone ran on a different frequency was a plus. I was disappointed to find that the range was not as good as my 5.8 set and even worse was that in the middle of a phone call the hand set would start beeping and suddenly disconnect - despite a quick sprint to the kitchen where the base was located. Granted this never happened in the kitchen itself but did happen as close as the living room 20 feet away. Kinda of eliminates the versatility of having a cordless phone. I returned it after 29 days and am back to my 5.8.
3,50/50,"I purchased this phone from another outfit, but I was very excited to purchase the phone after reading the reviews on here and the ones I research from other sites. The phones are great compared to what I was dealing with before. The biggest irritation I have with them is that when I'm talking on the phone it works fine; but constantly throughout the call it seems as though I'm talking through a tunnel and I have to constantly ask ""are you there"" to the other party because I cannot hear anything. There is no sound in my ear so I have to check to see if the phone call is still connnected."
4,Phone system works great!-,I have been very pleased with the quality of this Panasonic cordless phone system. I am happy with the value price that I paid also.
3,Disappointing -,"Have to enter phone #s into each individual hand set, doesn't alphabetize them, and doesn't seem to identify anything incoming as well. Range is quite limited."
4,Convient cordless phone system,"Convient cordless phone system - clear sound and good loud ring. A little trouble learning how to program system, but the essentials work well. Would recommend to others."
4,Great Phone,"This is a great phone. The buttons are large, and easy to use. I would buy again, but it's not perfect. Pros: 1) Ordinary AAA rechargable batteries is a big plus. I'm throwing away the old phone because the batteries are more than a new phone system. 2) Super clear, doesn't interfere with Bluetooth speakers or my Internet like the old phone. 3) Large easy to use buttons. Cons: C1) Panisonic got rid of the Room monitor feature from the older 2.4 GHz phone system. This is really a shame since the old Panisonic made a fantastic clear digital baby monitor with no neighbors able to ease drop. C2) The down arrow is now the same as the menu button from the top menu, a real dumb step backwards. Caller ID, probably the most used feature to see who called while away, is now buried in a menu. On the old phone, you just hit the down arrow to scroll through the callers, but not with this phone - you hit menu twice. And I'm sure it's just me, but why can't they make a universal base?"
5,Nice set of Phones great features,Bought as a gift for my family they love them. Intercom is a nice feature.
2,Panasonic has VERY poor customer service,"I bought this phone set a month ago. When I received it, I found that one of the AC adapters was not functioning correctly (would not charge). I called Panasonic and they said they would send me a new one immediately. 24 days and 3 times faxing the information to them I still haven't received the new adapter. I paid for 4 working phones and I only have 3. I wanted to enjoy these new phones, but as of now I would NOT recommend them."
3,"Great audio, but has design flaws","This is, overall, a good replacement for my previous cordless phone system. However, it has two design problems that I don't like. The worst one is the prongs on the power bricks...they don't ""hold on"" to the wall socket at all. They're so loose that the weight of the brick can pull it out of the wall socket. Also, the menu system is awkward for getting to a couple of frequent items, like deleting your missed calls. And a very minor complaint...all three ring tones for this phone are lame. How about just a plain ""telephone ring?""Superb audio quality, though, and long battery life, and no interference with my wireless home network."
1,Terrible range.,"What a huge disappointment. The base is in my bedroom. If I walk two rooms away, into the kitchen: ""No link to base.""It's an absolute joke. A cordless phone that requires you to be within 20 feet of the base unit. Too bad I already threw the box away. Now I just have to junk the phones and get something else."
3,Decent handset with many shortcomings,"Had purchased this set back in 2009 based on a recommended Consumer Report review. The pros: it works without interference from wifi or other wireless devices. Good signal strength. It has a built in answering device on its main base. The battery life is good. I do find the Caller ID function to be quite helpful. Now for the cons. Even on maximum setting the volume level is still low making it a challenge to hear soft spoken voices. The menu layout is not user friendly. Too many button pushing to get where you want. The backlight on the LCD is orange; not the most pleasing of color and you can't change it. Overall, I would recommend this product with reservations. I had expected a better handset with the kind of price I paid."
1,UGH! Hate these phones,"We have had our phones for almost a year now. They keep blinking off and cutting off calls, even when the battery says it's full. This was happening with our old handsets, so we bought more and it's happening with the new ones too!"
2,Not user friendly,"Am missing my old phones, this is to many button pushes before u can delete, review or look up a number."
2,unhappy,"No interference with wireless devices, but limited range. Drops calls. Not a great product. Weak on features."
4,Wonderful.,"This is a great phone.There is one base that hooks into the phoneline, and the rest of them just plug into the wall.There are a series of different rings,and the telephone is very easily set up."
5,Great Phone!,I'm very pleased with this product. It has a crystal clear sound. There's no static or interference like the cordless phone I had before.
1,worst phone ever,"I read all of the recommendations for this phone before purchasing it...most of them were glowing...this is the worst phone that I have ever owned...has very limited range, and calls are constantly dropped...literally, in the middle of a call, with no warning the phone suddenly starts to busy signal over and over and the call is lost ( a major problem if it is an important call and a huge nuisance otherwise!)...I called panasonic and was told to unplug the phones and plug them back in again, and to reinsert the batteries....no help there at all!!! I would have given no stars, but the rating system does not allow for it."
2,"Simple, Easy, Reliable Panasonic Cordless-Good Value","If you seek a very nice, simple to set up, easy to purchase and most of all very reliable cordless phone I can strongly recommend this one. It has more than enough features for 95% of everyone needing a cordless phone. Having four seperate headsets is very important for someone like me who is getting older. I have one in the bedroom, basement, kitchen and living room. The battery lasts seemingly forever; the reception is crystal clear and strong, and it has a classy design. The DECT format is brilliant and is better than any other cordless phone I have owned."
5,Great phone!,"I researched a lot of cordless phones. I was originally looking at a V-tech phone - heard lots of good things about them - (and I don't want to put V-tech in a bad light) but after reading many user reviews like this one I decided on this Panasonic. It is an awesome phone and I got 4 handsets for the price of the three that I would have gotten with the V-tech I looked at!This phone has the latest Dect 6 technology, the ability to transfer all or part of your phone book to the other handsets by just pushing a few buttons, the menus are easy to figure out and the sound quality is excellent. I haven't noticed any interference from appliances and things. It even has some cool ring tones and holds a charge forever! (OK, for a very long time anyway!)By all means, do some research first, but definitely give this phone a chance - I'm so pleased that I got this one instead of the first one that I had in mind."
4,I Like it,This phone provides all functions expected of a cordless phone and does all of them well. The only criticism I have is that the menu scheme is not very intuitive and takes longer to learn than earlier models. Everything else about this phone is positive. I'd recommend this product highly.
1,Disappearing sound,"I selected this phone because I needed a 4 unit telephone system and it had good reviews.From the moment I started using it, after a few minutes into a call, my voice would disappear from the earpiece. The person on the other end could hear me well, but I could not hear myself, which caused me to raise my voice.I returned it for an exchange hoping that it was a fluke with the set I recieved. I was wrong. I am returning the second set and going to Costco or Target for something else."
5,Panasonic Cordless Phone,"This is a great cordless phone. I am using it with my Magic Jack VOIP phone service & the folks I have called said the sound quality was great. The range is good, & it doesn't interfere with my wireless data network. All in all I would say that this is a good phone. The batter life is excellent.It could possibly use a little more volume for the handset, but is adequate for me and anyone with decent hearing.Anyone who is hearing challenged would likely find that they needed more volume.The menu system is a little confusing, but does the job. The answering machine is clear and loud enough as well."
4,nice,"transfer calls with a breeze, intercom nice plus (calling kids upstairs) alot better than yelling i tell ya. you'll like it"
4,Phones works almost perfect!,"Setting up our new phones was easy and quick. One is parked between two wireless printers with absolutely no interference. Only negative is that when looking at the blinking light for new message it does not tell us how many are there like our old Panasonic nor does it make a sound so we know there is a message without looking. Also, we don't seem to be able to turn off the speaker phone during the call. Perhaps we need to reread the book."
4,Cordless Phone,"Panasonic Dect 6.0 Series 4 Handset Cordless Phone System with Answering System (KX-TG1034S)System works fine at this time except one handset battery has ""gone South"" in less than 2 months.Lack of ""Backlite"" key board is a definate minus feature. Did not consider this an issue when purchased. Also would like 2 additional hand sets but the cost is almost as much as the complete four phone system."
4,good stuff,"Some of the menus on the phone are a little clunky, but otherwise, the phone is excellent. Speakerphone is a little bit tinny, but otherwise, sound quality is excellent. All the other features that I've used are excellent. It doesn't interfere with my wireless network at all."
4,Panasonic Dect 6.0,"Easy to install considering my son did it for me because I was out of the country. Wished it had a colored screen. Overall reception is great. Worked well with Vonage. Had to turn off ""answering machine"" feature. Vonage features worked better. Overall, a great product, though a bit pricey."
4,BEST PHONE I'VE HAD,RANGE IS GOOD. EASY TO SET UP. EASY TO SEE KEYS ON KEYPAD. WISH IT HAD AUDIBLE BEEP WHEN THERE IS A NEW MESSAGE. WOULD BUY AGAIN.
4,"Fast Delivery, Okay Phones","The product was delivered in a timely manner, but the phones do have some problems. There is bad reception between different floors and sometimes calls drop. Overall, they get the job done though."
5,exactly what I wanted!,The best part about having these four phones is their size! You don't need a lot of table space.
1,Gimme a couple of tin cans and some string,If the voice quality of a phone set is bad then all the bells and whistles don't mean a thing. The connection between Bell and Watson was probably better than than you will get on this phone.
4,BUY IT,"EXCELLENT SYSTEM. ABSOLUTELY NO WIRELESS INTERFERENCE. LARGE BUTTONS ARE EASY TO SEE AND USE. SPEAKERPHONE FEATURE IS SO GOOD ,THE OTHER PARTY DOES NOT REALIZE THEY'RE ON A SPEAKERPHONE. ALSO , PHONEBOOK FEATURE IS EASY TO SET-UP. PROGRAM ONE STATION AND THE OTHER STATIONS COPY WITH ONE COMMAND."
4,"Finally, user friendly instructions.","What a delight to be able to install, program, and pesonalize a phone set in minutes without having to wade through a technical instruction manual that is not user friendly. I love the ability to have the phone list on all phones. While I wish the design was more High Tech like the VTECH set, I can't cope with Vtech's instruction manual. Great purchase! Even my husband found it easy."
5,Panasonic phone,"My only regret is that I didn't purchase this phone sooner. It does everything I need: it transmits information to the other handsets, the answering unit makes the need for phone-company-provided voicemail unnecessary, it's easy to hold and operate. The battery lasts a long time. The reception is clear in any room of the house. The only feature it's missing is a backlit keypad to make dialing in dim light easier, but the phone is so good overall that I don't consider it a major drawback."
3,mixed feelings,"On my second set of phones after sending the first set back for a sound-loss issue that a few others have raised in their reviews. Thought I would take the chance initially (and again in getting a replacement instead of a refund) given the sheer number of reviewers who did not have this problem, but it looks like I may have been cursed twice! I love the phones, but my wife complains that the replacement set of phones are exhibiting the same problem--if less frequently. She'll be in the midst of a conversation when the other party suddenly goes silent for several seconds. It only seems to happen to her, but, then again she's on the phone a lot more than I am! My only other complaint is that the range is far, far lower than I was expecting. A short walk out the front door and I've lost the signal--no more than 40 feet from the receiver."
3,Panasonic Cordless phone KX-TG10345,"I purchased this phone to replace an older version of Panasonic cordless phone. The instructions are well-written. It is nice to have 4 phones spread out thru the house. However, I wish this set had the capacity to increase the volume of the speaker. I had problem with it a couple of days ago where I was unable to dial out. The instruction booklet was not very helpful in resolving the problem so I just unplugged the power source and that seemed to solve the problem. I am not sure why it was not working. It is easy to add numbers to the phonebook. The handset has a comfortable feel in my hand. The phone is easy to dial. The voice mail is easy to operate."
4,Quality Product-No Interference,"These phones work great. I now only have these phones in my home. The 900mhz phones I had interfered with our baby monitor. These work at 1.9ghz which is great, because it won't interfere with most wireless devices (including monitors, other phones, and 802.11g wireless). The speakerphone works well, it is easy to setup and use, and has decent range outside of the house. The only change I would like, is if more than six phones could be linked to one base."
5,VERY IMPRESSED,"This was my first Dect 6.0 phone. I'm very impressed with the sound quality and the reception I receive (even from outside the house). The flexibility of 4 handsets is what sold me initially but the phone itself is full of great features. I've owned this phone for just over 2 years and its still going strong. Great Job Panasonic. You haven't let me down yet. Bottom line, I recommend this product..."
5,Great phone with many features!,These phones were easy to install. There are some great features that my previous phone didn't have.Wide selection of ring tones and volumes.Great price!
4,What message,"This phone system is just fine except for the answering machine, it doesn't have a beep or any sound to alert you there is a message. The light on top of the phone blinks but it is so small you don't pay much attention to it. The answering part has very good sound quality as do the phones themselves. Overall quality is very good, large buttons are great, selections of ring tones are very good."
4,"Clear sound and reliable performance, although not ""sexy"" looking","I originally purchased a set of V-tech phones that oozed hi-tech and sexy, with color image display and a futuristic shape. I returned after realizing that for all their sex appeal, the base couldn't be wall-mounted. After looking at the positive reviews and confirmation that this unit is, indeed, wall-mountable, I jumped in. Know in advance - it's not a flashy phone. The display is black and white and very basic and the keys are, well, boring. But I've grown to love it as a reliable, well-perfoming phone. I really don't have anything bad to say about it. You won't be disappointed with this phone, other than possibly with its appearance."
4,Panasonic KX-TG1034S,The phone system was very easy to connect and setup. The menu's are very easy to use. A big plus was that there was virtually no static from the high voltage power lines near home. The only real problem that I saw was that the maximum distance between the handset and the base was not as far as I thought it should be. Appears to be about 40 ft. I would reccomend this phone.
5,Panasonic KX-TG 1034S Phones,I am very pleased with the new Dect 6.0 phones. When on speaker phone the voice is very sensitive and no need to put you face into the phone so the other party can hear you. It is user friendly.
5,"Great Quality, No Useless Features","I have been using this phone for some time, and liked it enough that I bought the same one for my parents. Calls are crystal clear, and menu functions are pretty intuitive -- certainly not any more difficult than using a cell phone. The DECT 6.0 technology is great, and well worth the price.I can't speak to the answering machine, since we never use it. We use voicemail (Verizon), and it works perfectly with this phone.The thing I like the best about this phone is that it has the features you want, but none of the stuff you only think you want. Color display? Talking Caller ID? Nope, not going to find it on here... but ask yourself, do you really *need* those things? I sure don't, and I'm glad to have a phone that has the features I need, and is functional and easy to use.Panasonic's KX-TG103xS series of DECT 6.0 phones is a winner in my book!"
4,good sound,Had 900 meghtz phones then went to high meg htz they picked up all sorts of noise these panasonic phone are quite and pick up good in all areas they have good distance reception with quality features.
5,Easy to use phone system,"These phones are easy to install, problem free and well worth the price. Our previous phones cut out frequently, We're next to an Air Force base, but these phones are not affected by the radar/radio interference."
2,Almost as good as the real thing,"I used these gloves in the Army for over 20 years. The mil-spec version was better sewn and used a tougher grade of leather. If I could get the ""real"" thing, I'd be happier."
5,Excellent Work,"The Prayer Offices of the Church often get side-stepped with the LCMS-thankfully there are a few brave souls who are trying to revive these offices. In my own parish I now offer Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer several times a month and it has been well received thus far. Taft's work is a great overview of the history of the Hours and reading it you can't help but wonder why such a magnificent use of the liturgy has gone by the wayside on the contemporary Christian front. What I love about the Prayer Offices is the tendency that they have to `slow' one down, stop the mind from racing, gently allowing one to bring Christ into focus through its liturgy and Psalms."
3,A Good Introduction,Anyone wanting a grasp of the history of the divine office's development will find this book valuable. Most illuminating is the discussion of the disintegration of the divine office in the Roman church; the paeans reserved for the Byzantine office show where Fr Robert's heart really lies.
5,A fine collection of poems from poets worldwide.,"This is a fine anthology which constitutes some great poets from around the globe. I found it to be a very pleasant and inspiring read, besides the wonderful poetry, the book has a section of authors biographys, giving an insight to each individual poet. As an author myself, I recommend this book without any reservations - BUY IT!"
4,Incredible Book,I reviewed an early pre-publication copy of the book and have to say this is definitely a must-read book for anyone in marketing or business in general. John Zagula and Rich Tong offer up five battle-tested marketing plays that are incredibly useful in their simplicity and focus.In the book they outline how they successfully used these plays while working with Microsoft and other companies. These straight-forward strategies can be applied to any business - large or small.This is a GREAT book!
5,Great Marketing book for early stage companies,Rich and John have done a great job with this book. It is based on their combined experience from Microsoft and Ignition. This is a must read for any early-stage CEO.
1,An insult to your intelligence,"Simply put, the book is claptrapped slung together by a couple VCs who can't work for Microsoft anymore. To help market this dung they convinced a bunch of cronies to submit good reviews on this site.Caveat emptor."
1,The vanity press comes to Amazon,"The authors have a loose grip on the marketing discipline. The ""plays"" (as in play-acting) offered are old, trivial or both. The value at the strategic or tactical level is minimal. No real marketing challenge is as simple as presented here, unless one's marketing job begin and ends with powerpoint slides. Be careful about taking the material too seriosuly.What is amusing, though, the ""Amazon plan"" the authors hatched. Hacked 5-start reviews were supposed to generate demand. Ah, but the negative reviews weren't part of that plan so one of the authors even wrote an op-ed rebutal, disallowing negative comments.Therein may be the most profound marketing lesson. In the real world, when a plan fails must adapt and try something else. Whining in public, or on the Amazon website in this case, is a immature."
1,No shame for these guys!!!!!,"Amazing that when REAL reviews are written, Zag & Tong resort to using cronies to counter the latest and most honest reviews (for example, Malloy & Goldberg work for the same company as them -- Ignition Partners). Is this the same level of shamelessness these two used to ""market"" the Microsoft monopoly?Obviously, the two of you are concerned that the book does not stand on its own merits."
1,Less than enlightening,"The title of the book suggests concise, useful and insightful information about marketing. Sadly, none are true. This is, simply, a weak book.The idea that marketing can be reduced to a few simple ""plays"" suggests the authors don't know much about the subject, or that they just wanted to put one over on the book-buying public. I think the former is the case. Successful marketing is very difficutl and Microsoft is a poor incumbator for good marketing.I also found the book hard to read. The syntax is stilted- lacked flow.There are some good marketing books for sale at Amazon, but this is not one of them."
5,It's sad to see that spam enters Amazon...,"Who is this person who keeps spamming our book. I'm saddened by this. Of course the folks who are going to review the book are people who know us. Its fine for you to have your opinions who ever is doing this, but that's no reason to call into question a bunch of folks reputations.If you read the book and didn't like it that's great. It's a free country, but please, please don't think that some of the fine folks who know us and the material are bad ipso facto..."
4,A very useful practical guide,"Having read a pre-publication copy of the book, I want to recommend people starting in marketing or those who have hit a wall on solving a marketing problem take a look. I found this a very useful text on marketing for any business. I've just started my own business, and there were a lot of tips and examples that were readily accessible and easy to absorb. The lessons in the book made marketing seem less obscure and daunting and given I've never taken a business course this was an important factor for me. The examples of the plays used to illustrate the narrative were easy to remember and apply to lots of circumstances. Very practical, but seasoned with the authors' impressive experience with Microsoft."
1,Weak,this book gives a lot of theoretical overview-type knowlege that is pretty useless if you want to go out and promote a product or service. it seems like the authors spent more time trying to promote their cute analogy about marketing being like sports than actually giving some information that you could take back to your company and turn into sales.
5,Must-Read Marketing Tool!,"This book provides a clear framework to assist you in getting a good grasp of the marketing field and successful strategies to put into play in your business. With years of successful experience under their belts, the authors provide proven methods that are sure to fine-tune the marketing approach of even the most seasoned professionals.A quick and easy read , yet with invaluable information. A must read for the marketing novice to professional!"
2,Poor quality router bit display/storage boxes.,The router bits are great but the wooden display/storage box leaves a lot to be desired. It's the wooden display/storage box which is terrible. The hinge arrangement on the tilt out router bit tray is absolutely terrible. The first time I ordered it the tray had broken completely loose within the case and the dovetails at one corner of the box were coming apart. The shipping carton was pristine so it wasn't a shipping issue. I returned the bit set and within a day or two I had the replacement (Hooray Amazon). Unfortunately the second bit set also had a broken hinge at one end of the tilt out tray. This item again came in an undamaged shipping carton. My conclusion is that Freud makes great router bits but their wooden display/storage boxes are junk.
3,"Good performance, but noisy","Tchaikolvsky 5th is performed gracefully and at a nice pace, however there is way too much background noise, with people coughing and shuffling and moving around. However, the performance of the piece makes it almost worth it putting up with the noise factor."
2,Find a different skin for your ipod,"It's very cheap. It's better than nothing, but spend a few extra dollars and get a quality case to protect your ipod. This case should sell for $2."
1,"You are all kidding, right?","You have all got to be kidding! I heard this CD for the first time yesterday and have to say it was awful! Have any of you actually listened to these words (I cant call them lyrics!) that he imposed on these beautiful, beautiful pieces of music. Sacrilege! Come on people! Go listen to Pavarotti singing Nessun Dorma. Neil, stick to schlocky pop songs."
3,Classically Sedaka CD,"I was very disappointed that I only received one CD for the price I paid for it. It seems way out of line compared to other Sedaka CD prices. It would have been nice to be able to view the songs on-line before purchase. And, it was not a new CD. I would like to return it for a full refund on my credit card. I have e-mailed the seller for confirmation to do this."
4,This is book is pretty good but....,This book is pretty good but there is no real pattern in the Ashleigh series-they show no back look of the previous book so you really dont know what happens-But this book is great-The story is one of the best yet for the ashleigh series-though they already did this about 5 times the story still is good-Will ashleigh re-find her dream? The race camp is a good idea- i really recommend this book!!
4,"Interesting stories, analysis, not so much","The stories in this book are fascinating and a good read, but the analysis the author gives always leans toward one of three things, mischievous children, hypnosis, and telepathy, as though telepathy is a much more scientific explanation than a haunting. I would definitely recommend it for the stories, while the explanations are interesting, yet redundant."
1,Boring and hard to read,"This wounds like a guy who worked for Project Blue Book in the 1960's. It is easy to make up theories and blame people for faking hauntings because they are now dead and can't complain. Each of the stories I read implied that a child or teen was responsible for faking things. To be honest, I couldn't finish At least it was a free download to my Kindle."
4,"Fun things to do, with your children.","I would recommend this book for a pre-school teacher, or kindergarten teacher. It's not what I expected, but it definitely looks to be a fun, educational book. One more tool, to help in your children's development. It shipped fast, with a few scratches, but over all, I believe it will be fun for my kids. Thank You"
4,Good for XQuery side topics,"This is a good book if you know what you are getting. If you are looking for a focused guide to XQuery practical applications you aren't going to like this book. It's worth repeating, this is not a general reference or introduction to XQuery. This is a set of articles on XQuery related topics. The first 'chapter' is an introduction to XQuery which is actually quite good. After that is a chapter on the history of XQuery. Then there is a chapter on XSLT and XPath, which is a nice, but brief, introduction to those topics. There is a section on the semantics of XQuery which is so thick you could cut it with a knife. The book finishes with two chapters on relational to XML mapping.If you are a serious XQuery user, are interested in a case study in standards development, or are into relational theory this book is probably worth a look."
4,Just what my grandson wanted,"I purchased this item for my grandsons 7th birthday. The item arrived very quickly, was packed very well.Good value.My grandson loved it."
1,Was Ripped Off! A disc one would get free from a thrift store and would resale it to unsuspecting! Not what the picture showed!,"This Guy / Gal Will Take You for A Sucker Don't Do Business with Them... I spontaneously chose this item by the discrtiption of a box you would figure would have up to 6 cds in it, well I only got a cardboard cd cover with a cd inside. I think I paid $30 plus bucks for a useless disc with no upgrade abillity because it did not have a cd key either. Sure they shipped it and I got it but as I better Review This Item I get more pissed over the deception I feel and Felt when I recieved it !!!! Thus the review redo"
2,Missing Link lacked that certain something......,"This book was extremely detailed and that's good but I felt that there was to much time spent on the details and not enough on the relationship between the two characters. At times, I was tempted to put it down because whenever Shanna took a bath it was described in detail. The chemistry between Shanna and Craig was minimal and the usual tension was missing. And although I believe in family, there was way too much family in this book. This is the second book I've read by Ms. Dickerson and I'm hesitant to buy another. Missing Link lacked that certain something that I look for when reading a romance novel."
3,I bought it a long time ago,I bought it a long time ago and don't remember much about the product but as far as I remember it served its purpose. That is all I can add in good conscience.
1,This dvd doesn't play in any of my 5 players,Paid money for nothing cause this dvd won't play in any of my 5 different players. Every one of them shows that there is nothing there. Blank disc? Useless purchase.
2,Hedge Trimmer has a problem,If you happen to run into a branch 3/8 or more one of the blades jumps offthe crank and it locks up. A shim in the crank area gets tangled up and has to be replaced frequenly. I have two of these and both have the same problem.It can be fixed but it takes time. If you can avoid larger branches it worksfine but it only takes once. I have all the other attachments too which work fine especially the saw.
1,Don't Buy it...,"I recently purchased this item to deal with a very high hedge. I previously used a regular trimmer and would balance precariously on a ladder to try to trim the top. This seemed like the perfect solution.Unfortunately it is not. It weighs a ton -- seriously, at least 40 pounds...so you are completely worn out by the time you are halfway through the job. Defeats the whole purpose of the system if you cannot lift it to do the job!I have returned mine -- and guess I'll have to eat half the cost (as I attempted to use it). Don't make my mistake."
1,Can I get a refund? Zero stars.,"I bought this along with the ""Mantis E-System Electric Power Head"". At first I was all excited to take care of business and show my overgrown hedge a thing or two. After a few sessions out there, the thing busted. I took it to a local dealer who took a week to replace a ball bearing or something, and then charged me 75 bucks. Apparently the warranty doesn't mean jack if you don't buy locally. Well, then I got another couple hours out of this thing before it broke again. All I can say is that if you have a hedge with anything more than a couple millimeters in diameter (mine is a laurel) use something else."
1,DOES NOT WORK with HP printers,"I bought this paper because it said it was compatible with HP inkjet printers. IT'S NOT! The black ink never dries to the paper and smears everywhere. I emailed the company about this problem and this is the response I got:""We believe to know the reason although we don't own a 1610 printer to prove.Your printer has dye based Vivera inks for Cyan, Magenta and Yellow and pigmented ink for Black. Our inkjet media you have is still the previous version of the Smooth Pearl Product which didn't perform well with the Vivera pigmented inks (in your case the Black). We launched this summer a new improved Smooth Pearl Paper that is now also compatible to the Vivera pigmented inks. Thus we propose that you switch to the new version IGSPP11.""They didn't even give me a coupon for the new paper...I doubt it even works. WASTE OF MONEY!"
1,Damage in the package,"I would not buy from this company or product again. When I took it to my local company to have my car stero installed. The intaller opened the package up and all the wires was burned up, destoryed."
5,Exactly what I wanted.,If you want a good and inexpensive amp wiring kit this is it! It was a nice clean package with everything I needed to do my install. I'm very happy with the kit and would recommend everyone uses it.
4,Gets the boom he wants!,My husband bought this and was over the moon. Its has really given a boost to his system. He still needs a bigger gauge but for now this is making it doable!
5,Great value,I was impressed with this kit. It had everything I needed to hook up my amp. Good quality would recommend it to everyone.
2,AGU fuses fall apart,"After two weeks are amp quit working. After tracing it down to a bad fuse (even though visually it looked fine)we found out that most stereo shops around here quit using the AGU fuses for this very reason, they get hot and with the vibration from the car the soldering inside the fuse fails. We went to the mini ANL type holder and fuse. Despite this, the rest of the kit was complete and served its purpose just fine."
4,Great 2 channel kit,Everything you need for a two channel installation. You will have to buy additional wiring for 4 channel installations. Had to go buy additional RCA cables for my 4 channel installation.
5,Great buy,"This kit was quick to come, a couple days after i ordered it. when i got it, i was surprised at the size of the wire. i was expecting much smaller for the price. it comes with all the connectors needed, wire ties, and remote wire. the positive feed was shorter than i would've liked, but it works. the ground is long enough to get it where you need it. the fuse is really good too, and looks kinda cool. highly reccomend this product, and have used it to install on friends cars"
2,Junk!,4ga wires are copper clad aluminum and have ZERO tenacity. The wire will break & frey when crimped with a good crimper.RCA cable end broke off one of the wires when installing. I've been doing car audio installs for 20 years and have never had that happen!
4,Great except the connectors,"The whole kit is great. The power wire is sturdy, the rcas are long and well built, the remote wire is a remote wire, and the grounds were nice. My favorite part is the heat shield that comes with the kit. It helps protect your power wire in your engine bay. The connectors suck and you might as well go to autozone and get some real ones or you will regret it. Other than that I love it and my system is bumping!"
1,been waiting 2 months for it,"Never got it, been on back order for 2 months now. Could have at least offered a comparable replacement. Customer was no help. Still waiting to install my amp. thanks a lot!!!!"
2,Hit n miss,"I purchased this kit over other brands in hopes of getting higher quality. The quality of the wire itself is great and if that's all you're looking for then this kit fine. The accessories are lacking in quantity and quality. For example there are no screws and only one size of small and mostly useless zip ties. Also the fuse in my kit was completely shattered. The fuse ships inside the fuse holder an there was no physical signs of damage to the packaging or the fuse holder but the fuse itself was shattered and couldn't be used. I attempted to get a hold of DB Link by phone and email but got no response. Any response would've been appreciated. These fuses are less than $3 but when you can't even turn on your system after spending all day installing it, kinda leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I will not be purchasing any DB Link products in the future."
4,Not bad :),I have two kenwood 12's with 1000 watt kenwood amp and the wires work perfectly fine. I thought the RCA wires looked pretty cheap but they get the job done so I can't complain. Good product. Good price.
2,Low quality non-copper wire,"I bought this and quickly returned it without opening the box after inspecting the cabling. The RCAs an accessories were clearly junk and the main power wire was poorer conducting Aluminum or Aluminum allow material (vs pure copper wire or even CCA-Copper Clad Aluminum. Now, don't get me wrong, if the user is putting a mid-line or cheaper system together and doesn't need the superior conductivity and less heat transfer that by all means get this kit. But for someone investing close to (or above 1k) of mobile audio, this should be avoiding. The wire didn't even appear to be 'true' 4 gauge, more like 6. The difference between aluminum products over copper is about 155+ watts and a much hire risk of fire due to the excessive heat properties. For those people who really care, please buy Rockford Fosgate, JL Audio, or even Streetwires amp kits and don't go cheap!"
5,Everything you need,This kit has everything you need. Ive been using it for approx 3 months now and havent blown the fuse yet. I would recommend!
5,Great,Package came as described with plenty of extra wire. No complaints at all about this product. There was more than enough of everything needed.
4,Nice Kit,"I'm pleased with it, and the wire is a true 4 gauge. It's been bumping for me. Nice Kit especially for the price. I recommend it."
5,good little kit,"This is a good quality kit, it includes everything you will need to install your amp. it even has the speaker cables."
5,Good for the price,"This kit worked perfectly for me. The length was more than enough for me in my truck but i could see how it might be alittle short in a car. The ground wire, even though I know its supposed to be as short as possible, could be longer. The fuse is a good quality and very easy to access. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to do a audio install"
3,"It's perfectly decent, but not great.","The power and ground cables look relatively close to the gauge they're supposed to be, which is better than I can say of most cheap amp kits. The length of split loom it comes with is enough to cover almost all of the power wire. The fuse, fuse holder, and connector hardware are all decent quality. However the RCA cable is bargain-basement cheap. There probably isn't a huge difference between this and a good RCA cable as far as the copper conductors, but the insulation is pretty thin and delicate. I had to be very careful to avoid damaging it in the install process."
3,Great begining kit,I got these to power two kicker 10s and they do a great job. If your looking for more power and have larger subs you might wanna go with the more quality brand. As for simple hookup these wires work just fine. I think the fuse holder is a little weak and the speaker wires could be a size larger. no complaints about price or delivery speed.
4,Cool,Kit has everything you need including the gold connectors. I only wish they gave about a foot more length... Its plenty gage for what you need.
4,"Great, works Great",I purchased this as a 4agw wire thinking that it would be closer to an 8 agw wire which was ok for what I was doing. The wires are 4 agw wires very good power flow through them for way less than the price of a name brand one. The rca cables are not the greatest but for the money it works great. I never have a problem with the lights dimming in my vehicle from power draw. Overall great kit for the money. I would recommend this to anyone looking to get a great wiring kit without spending a lot of money.
2,"Everything worked well, EXCEPT....","Spent most of the afternoon installing this kit for an amplifier in the trunk of a Dodge Neon. Routed all the cables, connected everything, and had problems with the Right side RCA cable that came with this kit. I double and triple checked all my connections and found out that the Red (right side) cable was not giving a signal from my head unit to the amp. If I switched the colors, (hooking up red to white, and white to red), then my right side speaker would work, and not the left. Anyways, a faulty RCA cable. Had to remove the cable, go to Radio Shack and buy another long RCA cable and it worked flawlessly. I can't return this product since most of it worked, but very disappointed and hated to waste my time with this poor quality cable. Needless to say, I'm staying away from db Link garbage in the future. Buyers beware!!"
4,Worked fine..,I used this on a 800 watt amp and it did the job fine. I own a Mazda 6 and all the wires were long enough.
5,Raised Panel Bit Review,"Produces very smooth cuts with no tear-out on top. I like the backcutter in that it produces the back cut at the same time. I have only used this on pine and was able to route with one pass, although I would probably make at least three passes with a hardwood."
4,Great with wine,This summer I was introduced to these crackers while at a vinyard in long island. I bought 2 boxes and never bought the wine. Healthy and very addicting! Enjoy!
5,You MUST try these...,"These are some of the most FABULOUS crackers I have EVER tasted! They are a MUST when wine tasting, and in fact, are terrific any time you are serving wine and cheese. LOVE THEM!!!"
3,pool pump,received it quickly. some of the pieces were missing(screws to bolt it down) It has worked quietly and efficiently.
3,small filter pump for simple set pool,"This filter is way to small for the pool 12x36. I only had the flilter one month and it all ready quit working.I did call the 1-800 # and thay are sending me out a replacment, free of charge.You have to keep up with the maintanence of the pool every day."
1,Waste of money and time!,"PLEASE do not buy this pump. Ours died after a couple of weeks of use. And we did not even use it every day. What was worse was the customer service at AquaLeisure, the company who makes Simpleset pools and pumps. I think they only had one phone line, because it was busy every time I called. I litterally called 50-100 times with my redial button over several days. We ended up buying another brand of pump that is stronger, the Intex 1000, which has a much better rating. Think twice before you buy Simpleset. It's not worth the trouble."
1,Piece of expensive trash!!,"I have had two of these pumps with two pools. Both pumps stopped working in the first season of use. They are made in China and are expensive pieces of trash!!I looked on Craigslist hoping to replace this pump and found that everybody and their dog is looking for a pump for their Intex pools. So, that means we are all having the same problem.Buy a different brand pump, BUYER BEWARE!!!"
2,Ok if you pool is VERY small.,Unless you have a very small pool don't get this pumpMy pool is 12 foot round 3 ft deep and this pump BARELY can cope with it.We are only putting up with it as it was the only one left as it's going to be winter soon and our old (bigger) pump got hit by lightening and stopped working. Next year we're planning on getting a bigger pool and bigger pump.
4,Works fine,"I have had this pool pump working hard for 2 summers. Considering the price, it has worked very well. I use a pool cover on a 3 1/2 x 12 foot round. It is easy to clean the pump. I only changed filters once a week but kept a close eye on making sure the pool chemicals were balanced at all times. Unfortunately the pump died this spring, just after I got the pool in balance after the winter season. I only gave $[...] for the pool so I thought I got a great deal and expected the pool to give out before the filter! Considering how much I use the pool I am considering moving up to the 1000 but then I will spend on the filter what I paid for the pool. Then again, maybe I will just move up to the bigger sized pool!"
2,Not worth it,This product wasn't worth my time or money. It didn't do anything for my boyfriend and didn't do much for me either. It more so just felt like it was in the way.
2,You cant blame him but..........,"Well. They try to be gritty, blue jean, blue collar type countrified rock. They are less than OK. John is a good looking fellow, and might make an exciting front man if the music was anything to speak of. I saw them playing an 'Emeril Live' gig on the Food Network. Unless you live in Antarctica, chances are there are most likely dozens of bands playing and living within 10 miles of you that are ten times better. So go and support your local band. All things considered (aka TV appearance) its garbage. I mean really, if Corbett was not a semi-well regarded actor (which I think he is actually an excellent actor), they could not even have made Emeril. They can hold a tune, but so can the fifty thousand other bands that play local bars and clubs near you. Nothing special. And look at the album cover, so pretentious. Yuk."
3,Don't be fooled by the first single.,"The song ""In Decatur"" is absolutely positively one of the best underground songs from the South that I've heard since Bout It, Bout It. BUT, after that the album falls off a bit. I wish it had more laid back flows like ""In Decatur."" If you're from the South, particularly Georgia, I suggest you go ahead and pick this up if you're a hip-hop fan because you'll be supporting some decent regional talent. I just hope that next time, more material sounds like ""In Decatur"" or ""On Da Grind."""
5,Not just for girls,"This book was on my son's reading list for school so I though alright. But I was amazed to find that he enjoyed the story. My son is autistic and can not speak or understand very well but when I finished this story he looked at me with a question and said ""Mouse friends?"". Now he asks for this story often at bed time. This is a good book for beginner readers and younger and I enjoyed it as well."
3,Sound is Terrible !!,Great idea for all the videos and hidden stuff...but the sound is terrible no matter what format you try. I have a high end system and would only expect the best from Motley. I feel ripped off in the sound department. I see many others are having this problem as well. Maybe Motley should come up with a way to get us a better version. Show proof of purchase and send it back to them for a good one. Sure they won't with all the cost involved.
2,Horrible volume problems ruin the DVD,"The volume abruptly fades in and out throughout the entire DVD -- including all the videos and menus. I tried changing players, sound (Dolby 5.1 to Dolby std), nothing makes a difference. I thought it was just my copy until I read some of the other reviews. Even my old VHS copy of Decade Of Decadence gets the sound right.Is this a mastering problem, or a manufacturing problem? I can't believe they would intentionally release something this obviously wrong.This should have been the definitive Motley DVD. All the videos, new interviews, etc. What a disappointment."
1,Just A Warning!!,"If you don't buy this item from Amazon make sure that it's NOT the ""Sanitized"" version. I bought the ""Sanitized"" version thinking that the label on the front was some kind of a joke not realizing all of the videos and footage I was missing. Missing from the ""Sanitized"" version are:Videos-""You're All I Need""""Primal Scream""""Anarchy In The UK""""Afraid""""Misunderstood""""Enslaved""""Hooligan's Holiday""""Hell On High Heels""Also missing is the interview with Tommy Lee & Nikki Sixx along with all of the Alternate Videos. I'm definitely going to have to buy an unedited copy. I feel that I really got screwed with my copy."
5,Good Stuff Here!,"Went to an 2005 Crue concert, wasn't expecting much, and they were fantastic. One of the better concerts I've seen in years. So I picked up this DVD for $16. Great stuff here, particularly the Sixx-Lee interview bonus discussing each of the videos, and good insider stuff.The sound is kind of flaky on this DVD. Sometimes too loud, others not loud enough, but just played with the remote volume button, and it wasn't a bigging, specially for just $16 for all these great videos."
2,Sorry I purchased this set!,Were these recording supposed to be a race against time? Was Mr. Hough in a hurry to get home? Where was the beauty and romantic quality that I find in Rachmaninov's compositions? Did someone shoot a starting pistol? I recommend listening to Yefim Bronfman with Esa-Pekka Salonen (my all time favorite) and the Philharmonia. Nos. 2 and 3. I want to get 1 and 4 if available. Take a breath Mr. Hough.
2,Bum Rhapsody--I got duped!,"Rhapsody:I have to agree with David DeLucia: ""From the 18th on he pretty much leads the field."" However, from the intro to XVII, it's rather boring music making that does not make a whole lot of musical sense and really doesn't convey the message of a rhapsody--it doesn't really convey any message other than, ""I can play all the notes.""I had reservations about acquiring this cd set because it seemed odd to me that Hough would perform these works and, even worse, record them. He extended himself beyond his normal scope--he should not take on music beyond the style of Saint-Saens (exception maybe the Liebermann Concerti) where Hough has arguably few peers. I liken this to the idea of Perahia playing Rachmaninov, Arenky, Shostakovich, Medtner, Prokofiev, or to a middleclass boxer jumping up to the heavyweight division. It just doesn't work. Don't get me wrong, Hough is the Middleweight champ!!Mr. A offers solid alternatives to this set.Piano Concerto #3 review TBA"
4,"Good new recording, with a few remarks","Stephen Hough has taken the liberty of interpreting the Rachmaninov piano concertos quite freely, especially concerning the tempi. I'm sure he has listened to all previous recordings (including Rachmaninov's own) before deciding on these interpretations, but they *have* raised some eyebrows, as several reviewers remarked earlier.Although the recording quality itself is really good (especially for a live recording), the mastering is quite soft, which makes this CD sound softer than most other classical CD's. Pity!Just details, though. Stephen Hough's masterful piano technique ensures a sublime experience of some of the finest piano concertos ever written."
4,hard to exchange,"THIS IS INDEED A NICE RING FOR THE PRICE. THE ONLY THING IS IF YOU ORDER THE WRONG SIZE, BECAUSE OF THEIR SIZING , IT IS HARD TO CONTACT DEALER FOR A EXCHANGE OF SIZE OR MONEY BACK. NOT HAPPY AT ALL WITH THE SELLER."
4,LOON UV lamp,Bought this for the UV lamp to cure the LOON knot sense for use on my knots and fly tying. For the price it was excellent.
3,Delightful,"Yes, this is a delightful read. Full of the nice things about living in rural Maine. It's one of the reasons why I bought a house in Temple and moved not more than a stone's throw from Temple Stream. Everyone who reads this book should come to Temple, attempt to canoe on the stream and meet the locals. That way they can know the facts and not the fiction (laughing)!"
3,Good TV Movie - For its Time,"Would not stand up to today's standards of course, but some good TV actors in roles helped this plot. Obviously, there are some ""holes"" in the story line (like how did the prisoners know about the song sung by jews at the concentration camps), but although not historically 100% accurate it is an entertaining TV movie. Interesting to see ""Jethro"" in someting other than his Beverly Hillbilly attire."
3,Escape of the Birdmen,"This movie is based on a true story. However, there was a part not included in this version of the movie from what I saw watching this movie on TV."
5,ColditzEscape of the Birdmen,Seen this on TV in 1971 and couldn't remember the name to see if movie was made on DVD. if you type in Colditz www. you will see that this Castle was escape proof?
1,"Great movie, lousy copy!","As I said in the title, this is a great movie, but an extremely lousy copy!! I would not suggest buying this one, since it comes out of Canada, and I've noticed with many of their video and audio products, they seem to be really bad pirated copys! I bought this movie, in the regular dvd format, and the picture was extremely poor and blurry! And this copy seems just as bad!! Don't waste your money!"
3,Escape of the Birdmen,"I saw this movie on TV in the mid 1970's & when I got the DVD I was a bit disappointed. At least one part had been cut out (Lt. Davies getting blinded in the commando raid) & about the first 10 to 12 minutes had been added as I do not remember it from the movie I saw. Can't blame the company I bought it from, but NBC/Timeless Media should've done a better job."
1,FRAUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,FRAUD FRAUD FRAUD DO NOT PURCHASE. The fil quality is not even that of a good VHS. You can see the vhs scan lines on the bottom of the video. Has not been remastered in the LEAST!!
3,Not that bad.,"As stated by other reviewers this disk is no where near the quality a blu ray should be. But the video does seem to get better about 10 minutes into the film. I have been looking for this movie for a long time. I am a Doug Mcclure fan. If you like this film this bluray is still the best way to see it. I seriously doubt it will ever be released in better quality. This film has the aformentioned Doug Mcclure, Chuck Connors, Richard Basehart, Rene Auberjonois, and Max Baer Jr. This interesting cast and cool flick deserves better."
4,Colditz: Escape of the Birdmen,I liked the movie and it is a classic story of escape in World War 11. I would recommend it to war fans.
4,"Twists, turns, and great characters","Cover art has little to do with this delightful mystery by Edw. Marston set soon after the Norman conquest (Domesday Series). The characters are believable although the dialogue seems a bit stilted at times. This series has been out of print/unavailable until recently, when I was delighted to find the series available on Kindle. There are quite a few books in the series, each set in a different location in England while the royal commissioners iron out property disputes that came to light during the initial inventory ordered by William the Conqueror. The Delamere Forest is located near (or on?) the border between England and Wales (close to Chester), so this book brings in the fierce nationalism of the Welsh as well as the attitudes of the Normans and the Saxons. Recommended for anyone interested in this historical period and a thoroughly enjoyable read."
2,Songs to Get You Through (Its Alright Now songs),"This album is a ""remake"" of the original, Its Alright Now record released in 1978. Needless to say I was disappointed. Save your money. Buy the album and convert it digitally."
5,Lovable tiger,My daughter liked the Beanie Baby animals when she was a baby. She got really attached to Rumba when she was around the age of 2 and it is still her favorite toy to this day. We have to replace them from time-to-time due to wear and tear or loss.My daughter will be 10 soon and she still loves this tiger dearly. I've purchased several for backups and have one especially set aside to give to my future grandchild someday.
4,sides not straight,"If you want pans that nest together for easy storage, these are great. They are the same quality as my other Wilton pans, bought individually. However,I don't like these because the sides aren't straight, with 90 degree angles. So, a layer cake doesn't come out straight-sided, which makes icing the sides more difficult. Plus, pre-cut parchment rounds don't fit, they must be cut to size."
2,Performance Pan has slanted sides,The description of this product claimed that the pan had vertical sides. This is not correct. The sides of the pan are slightly slanted making the pans impractical for baking a multiple layer cake.
2,burnt my cake,i properly greased my pan and the cake still got burnt on the bottom and it left stains in my pan i expected more
2,Not worth it for the price,"When I received the product in the mail, I was excited to get it on my DS based on all the reviews I read. I opened the package and discovered little wood chips melded inbetween the plastic. I figured, no big deal since my DS was black (might have been a problem with other light colored systems, I'm referring to the clear case). After 3 days of it being on my system, the plastic ""cracks"" all over.I found a very similar crystal case else-where for less then half the price and with free shipping. After a week of use, this case was in the trash."
4,John Hammond Does It Again,"I've been a big fan of John Hammond since I first heard his playing on the soundtrack of the movie ""Little Big Man"". He's a historian of the Blues, acoustic and electric and it shows. He can accurately replicate just about any historic Blues figure you can name. He's equally adept at the guitar and the harmonica and a joy to listen to.This recording is a fine sampling of what John can do. You get to hear some originals and some covers, mostly acoustic with some electric thrown in for good measure. Not a bad song in the bunch. There is definitely something for everyone on this album.I'd definitely recommend this CD as a welcome addition to any collection of Blues."
1,Horrible,Physics is for chumps. I want to move to Glasgow where I will await The Doctor. He should be there sometime in September of 2017.
3,pedantic,"Some people may find this physics book more friendly than, say the Berkeley Physics course textbooks, but really this uses too many words to describe the concepts, and as a result, the time involved in reading about everything is much greater than necessary, and it then does not require a comprehensive understanding of the material. Its mechanics section is unbelievably pedantic. Of course, since electricity and Magnetism is inherently more difficult to understand, the extra words are not quite so superfluous. It is not at all difficult to learn HOW to do the problems without understanding why."
5,Make me wanna read it again!,"The characters were engaging. This was a nice read and a wonderful follow-up. The story wasn't too long and it never missed a beat. It was humbling that Kyla finally found comfort in her own skin after all of her trials.With so many new or unheard of African-American authors on the scene with books of all genres and subject matters---the proof is out there that almost anyone can write a book. However, it takes true talent to tell a story. Nikki Rashan's got what it takes."
4,You make me wanna keep reading,"Great follow up...once I started reading this story I had to finish it. Nikki did another good job. The charaters were believable, which help to share the fantasy. I really cant wait til her next book comes out."
2,A true bore!,"I was very dissapointed in ""You Make Me Wanna""! There was no excitement within the pages of this book other than the drama between Tiff and Kyla in the earlier chapters! Just like Nikki Rashan's, Double Pleasure Double Pain, this book was extremely slow and didnt pique my interest! If you must read this book, buy it used so you wont feel like your money has been wasted!"
5,Cheap and Works Great!,"This product arrived very quickly. The bargain price is a real bonus. These lancets work well and are almost painless. They are by far the ""closest to pain free"" lancets I've ever used. I'm so glad they come in a pack of 200."
5,test lancents,i liked the price and the quantity. i buy 1 box roughly every 3 months and use 2 per day.
5,more cool piano jazz Xmas,"most of us cannot get enough of the Charlie Brown Xmas cd, so here's a cd that is in the same vibe. the pieces are warm, but whimsical, very easy on the ear. the Peanuts gang would approve of this one."
3,leeway open mouth kiss,"certain change in the sound, but a great LP . leeway has constantly evolved and this is a great musical adjustment they made."
1,do not buy this!!!!!!!!,this is not the original leeway some of the member are the same but they are totally different and messed up on drug by the looks of things.
4,Iwo Jima: Portrait of a Battle: United States Marines at War in the Pacific,"The individual photographs and the assembly of them create an awesome collection that captures the flow of the engagement, and evoke emotions about the gruesome tenacity of the Japanese and courage of the US Marines. The descriptions accompanying the photographs, provide a good history of the campaign. Recommended for those interested in studying the engagement."
2,Make sure it's compatible with your operating system,"I have a lot of respect for D-Link products, but this particular one (model DSB-P36) can throw you a curve. There are two possible chips inside the connector, and two different drivers. One works with XP and one doesn't. If you look at the support site... they have a table that shows you the differences and how to tell if you have the right one. Read it before buying, or you may wind up returning it."
3,Good condition for uses,"This was a gift shipped directly to my daughter, but she is very happy with it. She said it looked carefully taken care over all these years."
3,"Good, but flawed","This book has very strong merits, but other reviewers have mentioned them so I'm going to concentrate on flaws the flaws (as I see them).One problem is the occasional factual errors. This makes many sections harder to read because you are constantly having to ignore the author's errors. I'll just give one example: ""As I do know that Pluto is a giant gas ball, I know your first hypothesis must be false."" (p. 30) This is just sad, where was the editor/fact-checker? I knocked off one star for this.The other is that some of the arguments have a bit of a straw man feel for the side that the author doesn't favor. I realize this is terribly hard to avoid (and perhaps my perception in this matter is more than a bit subjective), but it left me feeling that the book is not as good as it first appeared (when I bought it on a whim). For this, I knocked off another star.Again, a book that has many good sections. It just needed a bit more polishing to be a classic."
5,the best introduction to philosophy,"Law deserves all those puffs from academics. This is easily the best introduction to philosophy on the market. It's by someone who knows the subject inside out (Law edits the Royal Institute of Philosophy's new journal THINK). It's ideal for those new to philosophy yet, weirdly, many of the chapters also manage to take you to the cutting edge. I'm doing a Masters in philosophy and I still got a lot from it. ""Could a machine think?"" is the best thing I've read on the subject.This book is going to stir up a lot of feeling in many readers - Law doesn't mind saying what he thinks, and what he says will outrage many (like homophobes - see below), but that's part of the fun of it. For anyone with an open mind who enjoys having their preconceptions challenged it's a total blast. I've noticed this is fast becoming a cult book among philosophy students."
2,not impressed,"Not brilliant and not very funny.EXAMPLES OF WHAT'S IN THE BOOK:I want you, happiness, and chocolate, but not necessarily in that order.Have I ruined your life, or was it already?Please let me know if there's any further trouble I can give you.Please don't spoil everything by telling me the truth.I want eternal life, or something just as good.ho-hum"
3,Textbook style,"this book I ordered through Amazon is a slow read; it is very text-book in style. Nonetheless, enjoyable and interesting."
5,"Yes, the cover is a lovely pink","which is a bit misleading. Or maybe not. Hardcore would be pretty miserable without the cheesy vocals, pianos and poppy tunes. It's meant to be fun. It must be the most misleading name for a musical style ever.It's at its most successful, and ridiculously addictive, when the balance between silliness, emotion and energy is kept just right, and this set is one of the best examples. Sy steers closer to the 'happy' side, Brisk is more bouncy and Kevin Energy does the freeform, which means a mix that can move from a cute, silly tune like 'Raver Raver Raver' to a seething monster like 'Clonecore' via many shifts in pace and rhythm, and it all makes sense.All of the Hardcore Heaven series are worth getting hold of, especiallyHardcore Heaven V.4."
5,Wonderful meditation music,"I have been listening to this album for years, and still love it. It is deeply meditative and yet also passionate. It's the only album I ever listen to while meditating. Parsons has combined chanting and chords from a keyboard in such a way that each amplifies the feeling of the other."
4,LOUISIANA'S CROWN JEWELL,"This is a well conceived book on the iconic Oak Alley. The images are well done and the text is quite informative. Oak Alley is the quenticential Plantation home, it is simply exquisite. It is a shame that the slave quarters were demolished years ago, afterall there would be no Oak Alley without them, though Anglo's designed this spectacular home, it was the slaves that built it. That being said, this is a fine book on a breathtaking home, in an exquisite setting. When one thinks of a plantation home, this is what you imagine. This is more Tara than Tara."
4,Nice photos,A very good book for a person that is in love with Oak Alley. Very nice pictures and a good history of the plantation.
2,"Wow, what a disappointment!","Aside from the poor quality of sound, three of songs were actually instrumentals -- not vocals at all!"
2,An old biased book written like a dime novel,"This old book was written back in 1950 with a definite bias in favor of the Earps as utter heroes, and the cowboys deserving of everything the Earps cared to dish out. It was hardly such a black and white case as that. One particularly glaring error is when Myers describes the pistols used in Tombstone (Colts with cylinders that swing open to the left side of the gun frame, (like modern revolvers). WRONG! Try Paula Mitchell Marks book ""And Die in the West"" for a far more well researched study of old Tombstone."
1,What the...,This is the worst movie i've seen! Worse than The Village! The 3D glasses dont' make much of a difference and give people headaches and cramps. The story sucked and it averaged a 1 out of 100 on a reliable movie website! Stay away from this garbage if you know what's good 4 u. The DVD did a better job as a coaster and a frisbee than as a figment of entertainment.Mr. GoodReview gives this item his stamp of disapproval.
1,Congratulations to Sylvester Stallone,"Sylvester won his well-deserved 30th RAZZIE nomination for the five roles he plays in this worthless mish-mosh. Rent it to see Stallone at his ABSOLUTE WORST, but don't waste your $$$$ to buy!"
1,worst. movie. ever. EVER!,"I am 12 years old and I am a babysitter. Once, when I was babysitting, the kids wanted to watch spy kids 3. I thought it looked okay. It wasn't okay. It was HORRIBLEThis movie was the worst one I've ever seen in all of my 12 years of living. Plot: Horrible. ""The guy"" has to go stop ""The toymaker"" he meets 3 kids, one who is supposed to be cool...what a dork. ""Bounce on this thing and you'll go to the moooooon!!""The 3d effects were horrible, so was the acting. Again though, I have to stress that the plot was garbage. Do NOT get this movie. If you do, I feel very, very sorry for you. There was nothing good about it at all. Why can't they let me rate it 0 stars...*stamp of extreme disapproval*"
1,One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen.,"I was never a fan of the Spy Kids series, but decided to go see this one for the 3D. It was awful. Besides the acting and plot being terrible, the movie wasn't really 3D. Sure there were red and blue lines all over the place but when you put your glasses on, the screen just looked discolored dark. There was about one seen that actually stuck out. I reccomend that you don't even consider seeing this movie and just seeing something else."
2,NOT 3D ... Just Distorted... Waste of Time and $,"Not 3D in the least. Some reviewers have said that the 3D effect was impressive, I see no 3D effect at all. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I'm watching it on a plasma tv (Panasonic not the Gateway), but that only seems to validate my review. If you spend the money for a high end HDTV plasma TV you should see 3D if there is 3D to be seen. This review refers to the DVD version which includes both 3D and 2D versions of the film. EXTREMELY DISAPOINTING! Story aside ... if you want the 3D effect ... (and you have a plasma TV at the minimum) DO NOT EXPECT 3D!I loved the first Spy Kids, and the second had moments of greatness ... but if you are going to market something as 3D it shoul;d be 3D!Signed,The Angry Consumer"
1,DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS CRAP,IT IS NOT 3D THEY JUST WANT U TO WASTE YOUR MONEY. IF YOU RENT OR BUY THIS YOUR WASTING YOUR TIME AND MONEY. Save it on something good like Master and commander or Last samurai or Brother bear for the kids
1,What a lame excuse for a movie!,"Is this supposed to be a movie!?What total CRAP!The plotline is laughable,the special effects are lame, (red and blue glasses) and the acting is pure,unadulterated,crapola.DO NOT BUY! If you are going to watch this,have a medic on call.Your nervous system will be damaged by this movie!"
2,LAME GAME,I would have rated this 2 and a half. This was a really bad and dissapointing movie. Why didnt they just do a great 2D movie? A bad story line and bad 3D could only lead o a bad movie. I have seen way better 3D (in sea world) and also the 3D hurts yur eyes. Carmen is only in the movie for half the time and the actors look all mature and boring. The family scene was so dumb I cant beleive the director isnt embarassed for putting it in. The only good scene is when juni has the robot fight wit demetra. Such tiwsts and turns shouldnt be in a movie which was meant to be simple. A DEFINATE NO-NO.
3,not that great.,The movie was awful the only reason I likedit was becuase it was 3D.The movie itself was just cheesyand boring.If you take off the 3D glasses it looks funnybut if you dont it kinda hurts your eyes.This is the only 3D movie I have ever seen so im not sure if the 3D part was all that great.
5,Best Spy Kids Movie,everything in this movie are really cool my friends enjoy this movie and i'm glad that Robert Rodriguez made a 3-D movie thanks Robert.
3,not bad,The 3D is pretty cool but there isn't much of a story . Just cool special effects . A kid will say it's cool but an adult will say the other movies are better .
1,....Disgusting,"Honestly, how can one even consider such a bit of drivel to be worthy of a DVD release? One should normally be wary of these direct-to-video sequels, and in the case of the Spy kids Franchise, one sequel was already too much. Absolutely abysmal, with nothing more than a desire to exploit."
1,"The worst ""3-D"" effects ever.","Ever been to a 3-D movie at an IMAX theater? Great 3-D effects there,but this is a discrace.At the IMAX they give you 3-D classes that are CLEAR.The Spy kids movie gives you the old school red and blue.""Whats so bad about that?"" EVERYTHING!When you put on the glasses the screen turns to a colorful mess.In the commercial Juni's suite is yellow,but in the movies with your glasses his suite is red or orange or something.Everyone's suite is the wrong color.Maybe you think:""Ew,I don't want to watch the movie like this."" Good idea right?WRONG!If you take off your ""3-D"" glasses,you will be sent to blurry oblivion.So it's your pick:terrible colors or blurry to the max.Thank god the DVD version has the movie in a 2-D option.And for you video game lovers,this movie talks a little bit about Metroid and Halo. :)"
2,Game Over.......FOR REAL!,"Ask most people on the street about this movie and they'll mostlikely say, ""Wow! That was so good!"" Reality check people: thisfilm was WAY better in theatres! Actually, it wasn't that greatin theatres and in this film there were only about two good parts in the movie: Whenever it's in 3D and the end credits. The3D is not so good on DVD players so I would suggest playing thisfilm on the computer. Nope, actually I suggest don't buying itat all. You'll thank me if you watch it."
1,Terrible,"Probably worse than Jurassic Park 3, and I walked out of the theatre for that. I would not reccommend this movie for any age group."
4,Awesome 3-d!!,"If you're into 3-d movies, Spykids3d is well worth the purchase. The 3-d effects are superb and setting the story inside a videogame generated world is a perfect setting for the cool 3-d effects. It has a pretty big roster of well known actors like Sylvester Stallone and cheech Marin and others. The acting is hammy and comedic but pretty well suited for this kind of movie. All in all I can see this being fun for kids and adults. I thoroughly enjoyed it and thought it was well worth the asking price on Amazon. It's actually cheaper to buy it brand new then it is used. 4 & a half star rating!!!"
4,"Superb ""Field Sequential"" 3D","Although the original anaglyph version of Spy Kids 3D is one of the best examples of that type of 3D around, sadly, although the 3D effect is great, as always with anaglyph, you lose the colours and can get bad eye-aches and headaches. Personally, I also suffer from redeye when I watch anaglyph 3D movies and so only watch the HQFS versions. If you have the shutter type 3D glasses and a way to watch field sequential 3D, this version is the best and looks great. Full colour, with the same 3D effect, but most important of all, no eye-aches or headaches that are associated with the anaglyph versions."
4,Fun Movie,"My kids absolutely love this movie. Personally, I thought the graphics could have been better, but this obviously isn't an adult movie. If you have young kids, they'll likely enjoy it. It comes with 4 pairs of 3D glasses and both versions of the movie (2d and 3d)."
3,Pretty Cool Movie,"I bought this movie together with Lava Girl movie. While the Lava Girl is so poor made, this movie is pretty good and entertaining. The 3 D tech used is good. Got to watch it one more time."
3,Spy Kids 3-D,"The movie is good, but it would have been a lot better in regular screen instead of 3-D. For one thing, the glasses do not even come with the movie, which is kind of ridiculous. When you go to look for glasses for the movie you have to have a certain kind to use for it and good luck getting them. Also, they are just a pain to try to keep on while you are watching it. We ended up just watching the movie without the glasses. I would not get another 3-D movie ever again. But, as far as Amazon goes, you are the best place, to me, to find and buy things. I have not had a problem with anything I have ordered from you. Thanks! Becky"
1,"Ummmm, OK","This movie had barely any cool 3-D sequences, was boring, and babyish. Juni gets zapped into a video game. The acting is pretty bad, and there is pretty much no story. It's just flying around on machines. Is that entertainment or what(sarcasm) ? You could enjoy it if you were a 3 year old, but, since you are on this site, you probably aren't three, so I would not reccomend this movie to you."
1,A complete disappointment,"Even the kids did not care for this overly long and amateurish movie that was a real letdown after the fun we had seeing the first movie, in particular."
5,best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i loved it it is the best awsome toatly cool the effects were awsome and i loved it in 3-D. if you liked it but not in 3-D thats okay beacuase if you buy it on dvd you can watch it in 2-D if you buy it on vhs though you can only watch it in 2-D. Sorry!
4,"Short, to the point, and fun.","First, if the 3D effect is important to you, STAY AWAY from the VHS version. No 3D effects on that at all. As far as the DVD itself is concerned, it has all you need to enjoy this roller-coaster of a movie. Up front, this movie is pure dreck. Every point in the plot is worthless. Thin and silly. But, just like one of my other favorite movies 'SPEED' with our Matrix-man Keanu Reeves, this movie is flat-out fast-paced and fun. The 3D effects were completely unnecessary, but also a nice novelty. The ending went completely against the grain of the typical action flick. Putting the 'Grandfather' (Richardo Montalban) up against the 'Bad guy' ( Sylvester Stallone). This movie is seriously short. 1 hour and 12 minutes + credits. That's it. But, it's a wild ride that you will likely watch many times over. Not as good as part one of the series, but, better than part two in my humble opinion."
3,DVD 3D effect isn't ready for prime time,"Those who are into Spy Kids no what to expect and will probably like this one.I was disappointed with the 3D effect in the DVD which is sometimes pretty good and other times not so hot. There are scenes in which the red and blue images converge correctly in the foreground, but not in the background. And, the overall darkness of the picture and strain on the eyes that others have commented about work against the overall effect that 3D thrill seekers are hoping for.Towards the end of the movie, the unexpected use of the word ""Corinthian"" by Ricardo Montalban provided an instant trip back to the 80's car commercials he did, when he would describe Chrysler's ""Corinthian Leather"" interiors. A nice touch for the older viewers!"
5,Awesome 2-Disc DVD in 3-D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Spy Kids 3-D:Game Over DVD is awesome!!!Disc 1:Spy Kids 3-D, Alexa Vega in Concert,3-D set-up{pick the way you want your 3-D},and Mega Race 3-D set-top game.Disc 2:Spy Kids 3,Robert Rodreiguiz ten-minute film school,The Making of Spy Kids 3-D, and more!! This is a great DVD!!!Veiwer,Zack Paslay"
1,Best Part of Movie was the Closing Credits!,My kids and I hated this movie. We liked the first two but this one was terrible. It had nothing to do with the 3-D. And I like Ricardo Montalnan and Antonio Banderas. It should be voted one of the worse movies of all time!
1,Dreadful,So busy with the 3D effects that they forgot to include a plot. Like watching a video game - and just as boring as watching a video game if you are not the one playing.
1,The worst one yet,The first Spy Kids movie was enjoyed by all in our family and our kids insisted on seeing all of the sequels. They should have stuck to the first one as in so many cases. Did not have the same energy and quirkiness that the first movie had. The characters also did not interact with each other in that easy way found in the the first movie.
5,Kids Love It,The main reason that we purchased this is because my 2 boys love this movie. We can turn it on and they are set.
5,Coolest Movie This YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Spy Kids 3-D literaly wraps you in a world of 3-D graphics and makes you part of the movie. It totally ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Spy Kids: Series Over,"Even though it was targeted at my age group, it was awful. The 3-d effects are awful. I mean, the color is awful, and one of the people I was watching it with got sick from the glasses. It seams to be be parodying the matrix by having 'the guy,' it takes place in a cumputer room, one thing I found in common is the line 'there is no spoon,' the movie feels like 'there is no plot.' Acting is awful in this. When I first heard that it was shot in only a month in a half, I was impressed. After I saw it, I could not believe it took so long to shoot it."
1,did not receive,This item was not received. Please refund. I do not need one now. I purchased elsewhere. Thank you.
2,Scamming the customer,"I purchased this video for my mother-in-law to give to my daughter for Easter. She was so excited & really wanted the movie. (She had seen it in the theater & loved it.) To everyone's surprise & my daughters ultimate dissapointment, the VHS WAS NOT 3D. That was part of the appeal of this movie, getting to wear the cool glasses & seeing the special effects. Now I have to go purchase the DVD to get her a 3-D version. What a way to scam the consumer!"
1,GREAT 3D~~TOO Much Anger From Cast is Obvious...,"Throughout the movie, you can see how the ENTIRE Cast is Angry& Tensed! Maybe Cuz THIS Is their LAST film in the series, and maybe cuz ""Juni"", is the ONLY Main Character? ""The Cortez Family"", ALL look Terribly OLDER, and BORING!.....Look, the ONLY ""Good"" thing about this movie , is the 3D effects. Oh, and ""Carmen"" has had SINGING lessons This Time around, to Once AGAIN, :( , ""Sing"" the Closing Spy Kids ""song""!?! ...this is NOT worth renting, OR buying!!"
1,THE VHS HAS NO 3D GLASSES - IT'S NOT 3D!,What a waste. My son was so upset that the VHS doesn't come with it. What good is it!
1,IT STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the most stupidest spykids movie in the trilogy.You do not want to see this idiotic movie. Trust me.DO NOT BUY THIS DVD/VHS.
1,Sylvester Stallone's support acting.,"Well, Sylvester Stallone is born to be the major actor of a movie. Thus, his supporting act is not working.Why? Trivial actions done by the main actors and actresses there did not impress. Sylvester Stallone himself outshines others. As usual, Sylvester Stallone worked hard. For a 1- to 3- minute show time, Sylvester perhaps worked more than 9 days to get all parts of the 4 roles filmed into his portion.Again, a great show. Stallone is a great main actor. He needs to be filmed in a great movie, or, the TV show ""The Contender"", like what they do to him now."
1,WHO STABED ME IN THE EYES,CONGRAD YOU HAVE THE MOST UMMMMMMMMMMM SUCKIST MOVIE EVER I THOGHT OHH ITS GOING TO BE SO COOL TO SEE IT IN 3D BUT WAS I RIGHT. WRONG!!!!!!!!!!! I AM SO SO MAD BECAUSE MY EYES STILL HURT FORM THE MOVIE WORST 3D EFFECTS EVER THEY USED THE OLD RED AND BLUE VERSION IF U GO TO LIKE A THEME PARK WOOOOO THEY HAVE THE BEST 3D MOVIE EVER SAVE YOUR MONEY ON SOME THING ELES I WAS SO BUMMMED OUT I BEGG OF U PLEASE DONT WAST YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP GO TO BLOCKBUSTERS AND RENT THIS OUT U WILL SEE THIS IS SO SO SO GAY. WORST 3D EFFECTS HURT YOUR EYES AND JUST A BLUE AND RED MESS. I WOULD GIVE IT 0 STARS BUT I CANT GRRRRRRRRRRRRR IM SO MAD WITH PAIN IN MY EYES OHH YAH YOU MIGHT FEEL ITCHYNESS WITH THE GLASSES ON. DONT BUY THIS CRAP!!!!!
1,Worst movie ever,I've seen so many dreadful movies and I'll admit that this is the worst movie that I've ever seen. Sylvester Stallone has been in so many excellent films and this is easily his worst film. It amazes me that he agreed to star in this pathetic movie. I guarantee at this time that even he thinks of this movie as horrendous.
3,Not as good as the first two,"Take one part Tron, one part eXistenZ and one part Toys, mix them all together with the primary-coloured palette of the true child/adult, and you might end up with something like Robert Rodriguez's eye-popping movie. Jettisoning logic and narrative sense in favour of eye-gouging visuals, the one-man-band filmmaker takes his third Spy Kids movie out of reality and into the plastic fantasy of a video game. Much has been lost in the process, including consistency of character and any semblance of humanity. The kids, Daryl Sabara and Alexa Vega, are older and not quite so attractive; the parents, Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino, are mere ciphers. Surprising compensations include Sylvester Stallone being really rather funny in quadruple roles and the sheer anarchic mayhem of the visuals that Rodriguez flings off the screen roughly every 10 seconds."
5,GET READY IN 3D!!!!!!!!!,THE NEW SPY KIDS 3D FILM IS HERE IN A HOLE NEW 3RD DIMENSION!GET READY AS THE 3D EFFECTS ARE GOING TO POP RIGHT OUT IN YOUR FACE.WATCH AS JUNI AND CARMEN GO THREW A TRUCKLOAD OF ADVENTURES IN THIS FILM GREAT FOR KIDS AND ADULTS.A GREAT WAY TO CELEBRATE THE 50TH ANNIVARSARY OF 3D.YOU WILL SEE EVERYTHING COME RIGHT TO YOUR FACE.AS ITS THROWN OUT OF THE SCREEN RIGHT INTO YOUR FAMILY AUDIENCE! POP ON YOUR 3D GLASSES AND GET READY FOR A FULLY INTERACTIVE ADVENTURE THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY CAN BE A PART OF IN 3D!
3,I guess it could be entertaining...,"And it's probably better than, let's say 85% of what Disney shows nowadays. It has alright characters from what I've watched and less than dazzling special effects. They were OK though, I guess.The action is somewhat entertaining and the girls aren't over-stereotypically feminine and girly (which I liked) and it was a colorful movie.No major complaints (didn't watch the whole movie) but wasn't blown away either.Good for the kids."
2,soo bad,this movie is the worst spy kdis movie out of the fist movie and the second movie. It was very attracting at first and than it got soo borying i had to stop it.. it doesn't make any sense anyways...
3,3-D or not 3-D? That is the question.,"The plot might of not been as good as it could. But the qiuestion is ""Is th DVD and VHS in 3-D? Are the special fetures in 3-D? Are there special fetures?"""
3,"Fun, but not in the same league as 1 and 2","I watched this with my little boy. He adores 1 and 2. While we enjoyed this one, it did little more than pass the time. Daryl Sabara (as Juni) is all right, but part of the charm of the first two movies was the bickering with sister Carmen (Alexa Vega), who shows up, but is not around long enough to do anything fun. Ricardo Montalban is always nice to see on screen. I kept hoping that his conflict with Stallone's character would be developed. The final climax is too much whimper and very little bang. Christopher enjoyed the visuals, but even he (at 8) realized that the film did not rise to the level of the first two."
3,Spy Kids three,"This movie was okay.Actors Stallon, Montibum and Swarezeniger did okay playing their roles but really did not make the movie more enjoyable. The movie tends to move slowly at times."
4,Cute,Cute movie. My kids are 6 and 8 and they both enjoyed this movie. I wasn't crazy about the new kid playing the brother; but my kids didn't even seem to notice the change.
1,Stupid movie,"The kids loved it, even more than the two first ones. As an adult, I found it absolutely dumb. It is a 3D movie so it looses a lot when watched on a regular TV. Story is poor, actors are not good (the wonderful Antonion Banderas is such a looser in this)...not interesting."
5,Great movie great condition!,I ordered this movie to play for my Spanish classes. This movie shows students a different perspective of the difficulties immigrants face when moving to a new country and I think it's necessary for kids to see that side of the issue. I would also like to mention that I ordered this movie and received it within a week and its like new!!! Amazing!
4,A Better Life DVD,"Received DVD quickly via mail. There was just one time that this movie skipped due to a scrath on DVD, but nothing too major."
5,Great movie,"This movie is very heartwarming, sad, and interesting. At first I was hesitant about it, thinking it was more for the Latino audience, but it's a very good movie."
5,Terrific little pan,I like this pan because it has 6 cookie pops as opposed to the new pans that only have 4. The new pans only have 4 cookies to each pan so you have to buy more pans to make cookies.
2,A sticky mess,This product was very disappointing. No matter what I did the cookies stuck like crazy!! Don't wast your money on this one.
4,Cute but time consuming...,"These obviously only make 6 cookies at a time so if you're making a lot of cookies, you'll want more pans or use cutters. They are cute though and really fun to put on sticks for a cute display!"
4,GameCube 2k Gforce Controller,"If you're an adult trying to play on the Gamecube with your family, you will appreciate this controller. It is larger than standard and fits an adult's hand comfortably. It is responsive and comfortable."
2,All I wanted was a Space Ghost T-Shirt....,"This t-shirt is so much fun to look at. However, if you must purchase, do not ever wash it. Because it's a white t-shirt, I washed it (inside-out) in hot water, which made the red collar and sleeves bleed everywhere. I washed it by itself in cold water, and the main white shirt portion didn't get clean. I refuse to pay for dry cleaning for a t-shirt, and with pink spots I couldn't give it away. So I had to toss it. Goodbye Space Ghost....hopefully Cartoon Network adds you to Adult Swim for 2012."
2,Not For Me,"I agree with the person who said she thought it would be an exercise program along the lines of Miriam Nelson's book - I thought so, too, but it is not the case. This may be a good exercise program for some but not for me. The first part is an aerobic warmup which includes a lot of jumping. The middle part is a workout with weights but includes a good number of lunges. As I already have bone issues and knee problems, I do not want to jump nor do lunges. The final section is some stretching and balance exercises. I will not be using this DVD. I thought this would be a good sometimes-alternative to a DVD I already use consistently, ""Skeletal Fitness"" by Mirabai Holland. I will stick with Mirabai's program which is EXCELLENT and covers all areas prone to fracture. I know with Mirabai's program that I am working to strengthen my bones but in a gentler, yet very effective way which uses weights, resistance and isometrics."
4,Not quite what I expected,"Miriam E. Nelson Ph. D: Strong Women - Osteoporosis PreventionThis was not what I had expect after having viewed the Strong Women Web site. I expected it to be more along the lines of the books weight lifting exercises, never the less the information is very good, exercise program excellent for beginners and does use weights, the program takes very little time out of your day and you feel you have achieved something when finished."
1,Miriam E Nelson PH D Stong women Osteoporosis prevention,I bought 3 items and I am not satisfied with any of themMiriam e Nelson Ph.D: Strong Women - Osteoporosis PreventionStrong Women Strong Backs: Everything you need to know to preventMiriam E Nelson weight loss is a useless DVDI will be giving all of them away to a used book store as they were useless to me
5,Vengerov at the top of the tree,"Those of us who have been around for over 70 years will have to admit that there has never been a violinist who more sensationally is able to make music at this level. He has the left hand of a Heifitz, the heart of a russian gypsy and the soul of a musician. It is truly remarkable to find in one player the best of all the things required to be great - technique, heart, soul, musicianship, understanding and an ability to create a large catalogue of sounds which seem inevitable. These preformances surely will never be bettered and rarely, if ever, equalled."
4,Another excellent interpretation by Vengerov,Vengerov has a marvelous of way of interpreting pieces in such musical ways that I feel Heifetz lacked. However I give this particular CD only 4 stars because I found that the pieces he played were not very entertaining. Only hardcore Shostakovich or Prokofiev should buy this CD. I recommend buying one of Vengerov's Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto CD's.
5,Cars cartridge is great!,"My son, who is 26 months old, loves this cartridge. He got it for Christmas and he very much enjoys hearing the cars talk and learning about the car parts as well as the usual shapes and colors. It is a great companion to the movie as well."
3,"m√©rite l'√©coute, et la r√©-√©coute","Oeuvre un peu n√©o-classique, et minimaliste.Bien que √©crite pour 3 choeurs!Je suppose et crains que le CD soit incapable de restituer la finesse spatiale.Rostropovitch minimalise aussi, et c'est fort bien.La premi√®re √©coute laisse une impression de pauvret√©. Mais les √©coutes suivantes permettent de c√©celer des richesses comme cach√©es.Une certaine parent√© avec les ouvres calmes de Arvo P√§rt.Conclusion ; m√©rite l'√©coute, et la r√©-√©coute."
3,Not as good a the last one,"The CD starts off with a distinctly Southern(read: TN) rap feel. By this I mean heavy beats and somewhat thin loops for the background. The expertise of this duo is not immediately obvious. Around about track 4, things pick up and get back on track to what you would expect. A feature by Canibus was surprising, given the genre. Overall, the CD has the typical 1-3 winners, along with some additional filler.In a nutshell: Not bad for the money ($5-6), but don't pay more than $9."
2,When are they gonna make another Art of Trans?,"GRitS are at their best when the underlying foundation of a song is a strong (catchy) melody. Witness ""They All Fall Down,"" and ""Here We Go."" On ""Redemption,"" Coffee and Bone seemed to have abandoned their original purpose of making the most innovative hip-hop in the industry and have made an album that merely bites what is on the playlist of any top 40 rap station in the country. Under the guidance of the production team of Otto Price and Ric Robbins, collectively known as Incorporated Elements, GRitS made their most memorable hits: all of which followed the above-mentioned formula. Now these 3 albums, made after their departure/dismissal, have exposed Bone and Cof's greatest weakness: the inability to make compelling beats. - FYI: Pigeon John makes ""Open Bar"" the strongest track."
5,"""D"" Size","I bought this filter cartridge for my Simple-Set Pool. My pool lists a couple of different sizes for this one cartridge: ""D"", ""1"", and ""small"". Hope this helps."
1,Rip off,Only a couple of songs are the original versions. I don't know how record companies get away with selling this crap.
1,Excuse me,"This jacket was a gift for my daughter. Its listed as an X-Large with no note of sizes running small. It showed up and instead of fitting my 17 year old, it will barely fit my 7 year old. The sleeves were damaged and it looked like an animal was playingwith it prior to shipping. Buyer beware!"
4,A great help for teaching,"The images of the book are great to teach pathophysiology. The content is actualyzed, with a great order and complete, eve thought it is an atlas."
2,"Yes, It's natural, but....","....I prefer to hose the area down with real pesticide, then move in the plants. This product tries to coax the bugs away. I guess I'm too aggressive for this product. Peace be with those who travel this smelly path. I prefer the scorched earth methodology."
5,Best Natural Bug Killer on the planet,"Neem oil is a smelly oil. But it WORKS. Bugs avoid neem at all costs. I use neem in my garden, got rid of CARPENTER ANTS in my house with it, treat fleas on my dog with it. Neem oil is also great for killing mites and lice on my chickens. Works wonders. Might be smelly but if you dilute it in water and add some lavender oil it helps mask the smell."
2,automated dial tones don't work,"Great unit - works as advertised. But, you'll be unable to navigate computer-based menus (enter password, ""press 1..."", etc.) This is dealbreaker, ladies."
2,dont like it,it is too thin and if u r not careful it will dry curlprint quality is good not thickness of paper
1,A Waste of Money,"I purchased this cd on the recommendation of the reviews already written. I beg to differ. I have heard better arrangements of Beatles tunes on elevators. The arrangements wavered between trite and downright maudlin. The tempos were dirge-like. The album was a complete bore.I know an 85 year old concert cellist who plays with verve, respect for the music, life, excitement and conviction, all attributes not to be found among these cellists, at least not on this album. I suppose if one wanted a cd for background music in one's restaurant this might be worthwhile."
2,falls short,"Sure I love the Beatles. And while I don't have much of an ear for classical, there is a lot I like. And I'm a sucker for rock music with real string sections. But this CD just doesn't hold my interest; it sounds like elevator classical. Who'd've thunk that one could make a string arrangement of Yesterday or Yellow Submarine that would bore me?Perhaps if I could discern the ""wittily chopped up [variations comparable to those] which Mozart and Beethoven wrote on the well-known songs of their own day,"" I'd like it more. But my wife (who plays in a local symphony, and does have an ear for classical motifs) also finds the songs uninspiring.The only tracks which held my interest were Help and Can't Buy Me Love."
1,Another Victory For Fans of Pat Boone,"Remember when you were a kid and you'd find some great music, something so cool you couldn't play it enough? And then your dad, trying to make a connection with you and seem cool, would start to hum the tune around the house, even though he really had no interest in the music at all and, in fact, hated it to his core?Well, here's a whole album of your dad humming."
1,What a JOKE!,"I bought these for my 4 1/2 year old because he doesn't like to wear the water rings anymore and I thought they would help him learn to swim on his own. I pulled them out of the package to try them on him when we got home and they were HUGE. They fit on my arm comfortably. I am 5 '3 125 lbs and my arms are not that big around, I don't even think these would fit my 11 yr old brother. There is no way he will be able to wear these when he is six which is the max age limit for them. If your child is obese then they will probably fit! If they only had 3 panels and not 4 they might fit him. I am so disguted!!"
1,Useless,"They were twice the size of my 6 year old's arms, and they did not help him a bit. I agree that they are down right dangerous."
2,BIG!,"I totally agree with the previous reviewer. Got these for my 4 year old (big kid - about the size of a 5 1/2 year old) and they are humongous. No way can they be used, they'd fall right off even on their tightest setting. No idea why they are being marketed and sold for little ones as, with few exceptions, they aren't going to fit any of them."
5,Five By Endo,"If ever there were an author who could wedge a knife into the cracks of the human soul, it must be Shusaku Endo.In these five stories -- Unzen, A Fifty-Year-Old Man, Japanese In Warsaw, The Box, and The Case of Isobe -- Endo draws back the curtain on a group of people obsessed with such themes as cowardice, sex, martyrdom, death and the love of animals.With bleak eloquence and hard-edged compassion, Endo creates a banquet of irony and emotion that succeeds in filling the void created by 95% of modern fiction.If you are weary of the predictable and formulaic fiction churned out by the big publishing houses, I recommend this slim volume. Shusaku Endo's stories feel like a gust of cold, clean and pungent mountain air from the top of Japan's highest mountains."
3,The Land That Time Forgot,"I grew up on cheesy SciFi movies so I love this kind of mindless popcorn fun. Nothing like the two movies made in the 70s, and gee why wouldn't their effects be laughable now they were made about forty years ago. Back when they were released they were at least as good as this one. This one centers on a group taking a trip by boat and ending up stranded on an island with a T Rex running around trying to eat them. The cast has some knowns like Thomas and several not as well known, but still they do a decent job. The group finds other unusual inhabitants and items like a pilot and submarine from WWII that has been there for years. They all work together to try and kill the T Rex and get off the island. Enjoyable enough that if it was selling for about half the current price I would pick it up but not for over twenty-two dollars.CA Luster"
1,D grade movie,It's watchable ..... just. I don't know the whole thing just seemed to be slapped together with a few substandard special effects and questionable story line. E.R. Burroughs must have rolled in his grave after this rendition.
4,the land that time forgot,"La pel√≠cula est√° buena, aunque no aparezcan los subt√≠tulos en espa√±ol, que aparecen anunciados en la p√°gina de venta de amazon."
3,Three Stars for Fun Entertainment,"""The Land that Time Forgot"" is a suprisingly good Asylum film. It is a fun romp on a tropical island. It has the Bermuda Triangle, dinosaurs, WWII Germans, unresolved plot threads, and a relatively happy ending. The special effects are acceptable, and the actors are having fun. Three stars for being a fun film.Caveats: Naturally, this movie doesn't have anything to do with Edgar Rice Burroughs; it has more in common with Gilligan's Island. The DVD has two extremely short ""Making of"" and ""Bloopers"" reels. The movie has no Commentary feature.This is the fourth Asylum film that I have watched in the past 72 hours. ""The Land that Time Forgot"" is the best of the bunch so far."
3,The actors that time forgot!,"Hey, it's Timothy Bottoms! And he's not playing George W. Bush! But if I were stuck on an island full of dinosaurs with George W. Bush, he would act exactly like this!Hey, it's C. Thomas Howell! A long damn way from ""The Outsiders""! And he looks emaciated! Hey, C.! Have a sandwich!Hey, it's that gal from ""One Tree Hill""! She can't act here, either!Hey, it's an Asylum movie! But this time, the story's not so bad! This time the effects are passable! This time the direction is competent! C. Thomas Howell was the director! He still needs a sandwich!Hey, it's better than Will Ferrell's ""Land of the Lost""! Hey, slamming my fingers in a drawer is better than Will Ferrell's ""Land of the Lost""!Three stars, because the Nazi U-Boat (don't ask) looks pretty cool!"
4,Great Piece of Hardware!,"Got my Router Raizer the other day and immediately proceded to install it. I didn't have one of the name brand routers it claims it's designed for, but my installation was identical to the Makita router. I have to agree with another reviewer about including a sample size of STP since it is the only lubricant recommended.Two bits of advice. 1.)Make sure you have the proper tools to install the raizer and 2.)don't be an idiot like me and vacuum up the table after use without first removing the dust cover! Thankfully there were extras!"
4,Super Product,"I have had my Hitachi 12v for about 3 years and have struggled with it under my router table from the beginning. I have the MLCS 9595 table; it is the same as the Grizzly G0528, only black. The Router Raizer RZ100 came with a bunch of parts that you will not use. Read the first few pages and go right to your routers section. The instructions for the Hitachi 12v were a bit difficult to under stand but a little study of the diagrams and I had it put together in little under an hour. The hardest part was making sure I was going to drill the hole in my table in the right place. It is soooooooooo nice to make quick and accurate adjustments now ABOVE the table. I would give the Router Raizer a full five stars, I would give the instructions 3."
5,Saved My Router Table,"I was really frustrated with an inexpensive router table I had purchased with a Freud FT2000 router under the hood. The router was a pain to use under the table and the whole experience was frustrating beyond words until I installed the RZ100. I am now raising and lowering my FT2000 without any of the problems I previously had like binding and tilting.The install and set up of the RZ100 is pretty straight forward with the very clear directions but be sure to set aside some time. It took me most of an afternoon to get it all set up. The time consuming part is just reading, re-reading, finding the parts, making sure you have the right parts, and then reading the directions again.I also had to drill some holes in my router table plate so lining that all up perfectly took some time too.Anyway, well worth the time and I'm very happy with the result. I paid more at a WW show than what Amazon is selling it for now so it's even easier to recommend at this price."
5,Great Product,I was a bit worried about buying this as it is expensive but after installing it I was so impressed I got two more and put them on all my routers. Install was not confusing if you read the instruction carefully. The first conversion was about 2 hours install time and the last was about 20 minutes.
5,excellent,"Excellent product and support. Very explicit instructions supplied for the different router types. Installation can be challenging but when followed to the letter, results in great $90.00 router lift. I had a Freud 2000 router and used it with this product in my table. I don't remove it for hand held use. Router table is used for furniture building, and box making, as a hobby. When used with the xtreme extension, you can have an outstanding table set up with easy, above table bit changes and save a lot of $$.Technical support from Bob in DesMoines, outstanding."
2,Put your money towards a router with above table adjustment built in,"I love add-ons such as this, ones that add function.. But the value on this one is just not here...Unless you have a router that you absolutely dont want to give up, if i did it again, id put the money to a router with above table adjustment.It will get the job done but...eh...I bought this for quite less than full price, but still find it unworthy.(And it does fit the Ridgid R2930 just fine, still i use the built in above table adjustment on it.)"
1,Description and picture does not match.,"Be careful folks if placing an order for this item.....My boyfriend told me he wanted a router for Christmas, so I proceeded to jump on Amazon to place an order for a router.The description of the product shows it being a router.... This indeed is NOT a router...Plus to return the item..The company charged me a 15% restocking fee... I can understand paying for the shipping both ways, but to charge me a restocking fee. This is a joke..........................."
2,Not on my router,"After purchasing this item, reading the instructions completely and understanding them I decided I didnt want to screw up my router with drilling it out etc. I bought a Woodpeck lift instead and sold the Raizer on ebay."
4,Great Comprehensiveness...Comprehensive Greatness!,"I am a Foreign Language Major in California. I bought this book awhile ago, and even though my Latin studies defer me from studying Cherokee, I've retained most of what I've learned, which is good for me because there are no Classses to avail in California. The language is not an easy one, but you dont even notice it's difficulty, due to the Comprehensive structure. I feel it is greatest for available for Beginners. The only problem is a lack of more entertaining exercises, which do allow for a better retension. it is to a form, as is the form of learning a Classical Language (i.e. Latin). Audio Cassettes to accompany are also available."
4,Good Book but...,It is a good book but I wish it came with cds! Need to hear it sounded out to make it stick!
2,CD not included as per description,Although the book looks very good it's hard to use since I have no idea how the words sound without the CD the description declared was with it. That is the reason I ordered the specific book I ordered. I am very disappointed and considered returning the item. Still wondering if I should have.
2,dissapointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am sorry and I am not one to complain very often, however this book is not at all what was described for the book I ordered! My description read "" In excellent condition, just missing dust cover former library book"" what I got was a book that looks like it was used to throw at non-quiet library patrons! Yes it has all the pages as best I can tell, spine is torn and taped together ,cover is dirty like a mechanic was using it and all edges have miles of wear on them. to top it all off I could have got a brand new book at half the price but nooo I had to take three days to make up my mind for the hard cover, review the add (which no longer exsists by the way) and pay the extra money so I could have a nice book for my personal home library. I have ordered many items from this sight and all have been fine but this one is a serious flop!"
3,Informative but not terribly user-friendly,"This book was actually purchased for my 9 year old daughter, who is enthralled with the Cherokees. It appears to be chock-full of information about the Cherokee language, however I don't know how she has the patience to read any of it; the font appears to be from an old typewriter, and it's just not a very readable book. That having been said, it seems to be quite thorough in its treatment of the language of the Cherokee and for someone wanting to learn the language there is plenty of material here to study. It would be wonderful to see this book updated -- there is simply not that much out there that we've been able to find on this subject."
5,Love this Man,I can't get enough of watching Sam Elliott and in this film he was very marketable to every age woman. Was delivered very quickly and a great buy
1,SAM,"I bought this DVD based on the one review that it had and the fact that Sam Elliott is one of my favorite actors.I did not like Aspen on any level. The story is thin although the parts where Elliott shows his depth as a master manipulator is fun. I found myself thinking that the producers got the green light for a mini after filiming started and put in edited cuts to fill the very loonngg space.Slow, poorly written and woodenly acted. The DVD though crisp shows that the master was not cleaned there is substantial dirt. Skip it."
3,Used product?,Please check my order. I never purchase used items if new ones are available and new ones were available. Thanks.
3,Aspen,"I never had seen the entire series, so bought it for that reason. Sam Elliott is great, as always, and totally makes the show. Some of the plot and the drug/power culture get tiring. And the annoying statement from the brother that the heros of Vietnam were killers of innocents is totally disgusting. Hollywood again pushing it's anti-American propaganda.But the part Sam played was good, of a man standing up for what he should and then doing it. And the convicted playboy learned to stand on his own two feet also and may actually make something out of his life."
2,Lack luster mini series,"Poor quality video. Didn't see original when first aired but love S. Elliott so took a chance. Slow moving, story line could have been better. Glad I didn't see the original airing."
3,LOVE THE STAR OF THE MOVIE,"It was a good movie but I wouldn't want to watch it twice. After viewing it, I gave it to the Senior Ctr in our area, as a donation. I love Sam Elliott, and that is why I purchased the movie, and we live in CO where Aspen is."
1,Worst movie made by Sam,"I love Sam Elliott and have most of the movies he has made. I had never seen this one though, and I was thoroughly disappointed. It was a terrible movie, the acting was bad and the storyline was horrible. A waste of time!"
5,Well-written account of charter school possibilities,"Enjoyed this candid account of a year at a charter school in CA. Easily accessible to all types of readers--parents, educators, administrators, and any one interested in charter schools and educational policy in general. I admire the passionate educators highlighted in this book and hope this book encourages others to at least be aware of other educational arrangements that might help our school systems."
5,A must read for Charter School advocates and opponents alike,"Jacobs brings alive the true challenges in organizing, operating, funding, and sustaining a charter school in her wonderful book, ""Our School."" The going certainly isn't easy. Despite support from the Board of Education, the Mayor of San Jose, and private money from Silicon Valley, Downtown College Prep struggles to survive. The fact that the school does survive -- and prosper academically -- is testament to the dedication, enthusiasm, and tremendous hard work of the founders and staff of the school. Jacobs tells a very inspirational story."
3,The Gourmet Cookbook,"Fortunately, I own the first two Gourmet Cookbooks and the Gourmet Menu Cookbook. This new edition is a good addition to that part of my cookbook library because it does add techniques and recipes unavailable when those editions came out. Obviously, from the other reviews and because my career was in publishing, the glaring and difficult to read yellow recipe titling really makes this book much less valuable that the originals. One way to solve this if you intend to keep the book is to highlight those titles you would probably use in light blue highlighter. Although annoying to have to do, this does solve most of this ridiculous choice's problems."
1,Yellow Culinary Journalism,"I cannot imagine how an experienced publisher could produce this abomination. The recipes may be fine, but the heads are illegible. I'm returning mine and will re-order when they re-print. The book's graphic designer needs to be replaced."
4,It'd be great if I could actually see it.,"This is the quintessential cookbook, the one cookbook that will make you throw all other cookbooks away. BUT (and it's a big but), the recipe titles are practically invisible. Cooking from this cookbook would be like the new bride returning home to find that her ""friends"" had removed the labels from all her canned goods. I am so disappointed --- I was prepared to give this remarkable book to everyone I know as a Christmas gift, hostess gift, birthday gift. It's that good. As it is, though, I am returning my copy and waiting for them to print it in something other than invisible ink."
3,"Not the best, not the worst","This book has a lot of great recipes. I just recommend investing in a magnifying glass to read them, as the print is very small."
4,A gourmet in every kitchen,"With this book and a little practice, your friends with want to know who your chef is.This book is a great reference for every day and every `special' day that you need or want to cook. Recipes and techniques from the very basic to the very advanced are broken down into layman's terms, clearly explained and easy to locate. If you don't want an entire cookbook library, this should be one of the few cookbooks you get."
3,Disappointing layout,The yellow recipe titles are terrible..Unless the light is right I lose sight of the recipe I am following.A few photos also help inspire and there are none..I am surprised a book was allowed to go to print like this especially one which could have become one of the kitchen mainstays.I feel this book will be under used due to its lack of being user friendly.
2,Less than expected...,"I bought this book with big aspirations of another ""Joy of Cooking"" with a little upscale to it. While I must say the design of the book is fabulous (I am a graphic designer and truly love the cookbook's design), the recipes leave much to pine for. I don't like that most of the ingredients are nothing I normally keep in the house and I am not likely to use often enough to warrant purchasing them. I have yet to actually cook a meal from it for this reason and I have owned the book for over a year. I will stick to ""Joy of Cooking"" for it is much more of a tool in the kitchen."
1,Yellow print is a no-no,"What on earth were the publishers, editors and Ruth Reichl herself thinking? Don't they know that yellow print is the hardest to read? I am sure there are some fabulous recipes in the book but its so hard to find them its simply not worth the effort.If there is ever a new edition I hope this dreadful mistake is addressed and the recipe headings will be printed in bold black. Meanwhile, I'll find new recipes on Epicurious.com, some of which are from Gourmet magazine."
2,Difficult to read,"In what is otherwise a fine book, the choice of the pale yellow color, on white paper, for the names of the recipes, creates a very difficult page to read."
3,Bad Design,"Put it on my Christmas list at the advice of a friend. I like to browse thru a cookbook to get inspiration, but not this book. The yellow titles render it useless to me. I suppose I could take my black pen and write the Recipe Titles over the yellow and that might help. I agree with others who suggest the Houghton Mifflin should offer to exchange the book with one that is legible. How many people looked at this design before it was approved???? A real bomb."
2,Not what it promises,"This cookbook is supposed to provide you with ""every recipe you would ever want,"" according to Ruth Reichl's quote on the back. I've had the book for nearly 3 years, and when I want a recipe and check this cookbook, 6 times out of 7 it does not have a recipe for what I want to make. Further, when I do find and use a recipe from this book, there is inevitably something off with the recipe. I just made the ""Snowballs"" macaroon recipe from page 675, which promises about 30 cookies. The dough did not behave as described, the size per cookie was insufficient for the chocolate filling, and I ended up with 9 medium size cookies, not 30. They taste fine, but nothing special. The recipe for filling for the puffed apple pancakes on page 649 is cloyingly sweet, and so on. With so many wonderful cookbooks in the world, this one has so far not justified the amount of shelf space it takes up."
2,The Gourmet Cookbook,"As a long time Gourmet magazine subscriber, how excited I was to receive this long awaited cookbook..that is until I opened it! What numbskull decided to print the recipe titles in pale yellow on white stock? What a waste. I'm returning the book and hopefully others will follow suit. Maybe the publisher will get the message that a book is worthless if it cannot be read!"
3,Buy Mark Bittman's book instead.....,"......Well, this is fun to read and the recipes I've cooked so far have been fine. But their claim that every recipe that we'd ever want is here just isn't so. Plus who times these things? If you can make the Chicken Divan in 40 minutes (active time), then you must have a gourmet kitchen with some help to boot. If you HAVE to buy a yellow book, buy Mark Bittman's HOW TO COOK EVERYTHING (now it pretty much does have every recipe you'll ever need.....)"
2,You Won't Believe Your Eyes!,"I received this book for Christmas and was really looking forward to reading through it and using some of the old Gourmet Magazine recipes. But I couldn't believe my eyes (literally) when I tried to read the recipe titles. They are all written in yellow and virtually invisible on the page. The chapter headings are even yellow on a yellow background. Where was Ruth when Houghton Mifflin made that brilliant choice?But hey, it makes a wonderful doorstop."
2,To pale for comfort,"As a veteren cookbook reader, I was disappointed when I received my copy of The Gourmet Cookbook: I couldn't read easily any of the titles. The designer selected the palest gold for the recipe titles, and I could only read them under very direct light. It took the fun away from just perusing the book. Other than this problem, the book has many wonderful recipes, that will be a joy to try for family and friends."
3,Best recipes - very hard to read,"Every recipe I try is really delicious except for a cookie recipe with chocolate chips and lots of dried fruit. The best biscuits in the world are on page 526.I think the use of yellow titles is a deplorable idea. An earlier reviewer suggested using a blue highlighter on the horribly pale yellow type. I tried that and the title completely disappeared - now there is only a blue highlight line.When I open a cookbook, I want to cook - not to come up with creative ways to fix a major publishing error."
4,what about the pictures?,"I love everything about this book, except for one thing: what happened to the pictures? I'd love to see what these recipes look like. Nonetheless, I'll take it on faith, especially since I justed dropped about $14k on a new kitchen. What's another $28 to Amazon."
2,Who selected yellow lettering? Nearly unreadable,"A cookbook should be a joy - easy to use, legible, and a delight to browse through. Of course, the recipes should make it worth your effort.After spending 20 minutes with the Gourmet Cookbook, I'm returning it. It's not that the recipes are bad, it's that the book is too difficult for me to read easily in normal light.All the recipe titles are printed in rather pale yellow. I'm sure this is stylish but it is NOT legible, especially when I'm just browsing through the book. I've worked in publishing and design, and I simply can't imagine how this pale yellow scheme got through all the reviewers without notice.If you must have the recipes, buy this book by all means. But if you suspect that the publishers may have placed their sense of style over reading clarity, look elsewhere. For me, this in NOT a joy to browse, so I suspect that if I kept it, I'd miss many of the the fine recipes. I'll wait for the second edition and see if it's easier to read."
2,too complicated,i was given this cookbook with great fanfare and have tried a few recipes - all are overly complicated. This does not seem to be a cookbook for someone wanting to make a nice meal in a reasonable amount of time. All the fussing is not for me.
1,"Gourmet devotee, very dissapointed","Gourmet has always been the leader in publishing cookbooks with pictures; and others have wisely followed their lead. Now, the first big volume to appear in twenty years and no pictures! A big step backwards. It should be published in two volumes if need be to include pictures.Then there is the serious problem of the yellow recipe titles. That editing mistake is beyond comprehension.Lastly, it is hard to believe that the crab cake recipe on page 335 is the best Gourmet ever printed, it's certainly not the best I've ever made! Too late to send it back, it's been relegated to the lowest shelf of the cookbook bookcase."
3,I don't use it as much as I thought I would,"This is a fine book, but not earth shattering. I have a few favorites I've made more than once and it's good to look through for inspiration but it is defintely not a must have like Bittman's How To COok Everything or Joy of Cooking. Also, some of the recipes seem a little dated -not as in ""retro"" but cool, but rather food trends that are 5 or 10 years old and weren't very interesting to begin with."
2,I Can't Read It.,"It's probably great, but I can't get it at quite the right angle under the light to be able to read the headings. The publishers should correct this and offer readable copies to owners. What were they thinking?"
2,What were they thinking?,"OK, I can live without photos. But as a fairly competent cook and cookbook collector, I find the yellow recipe titles annoying. The publisher has done this excellent collection a great disservice. Cookbooks are not just a collection of recipes they are 3/4ths inspiration. Please make the second edition more reader friendly. I was hoping this book would be a useful Christmas present, no way."
4,"Great Book, Bad Typeface","Ditto the other reviews about the yellow titles of the recipes--very difficult to read in normal light--and I don't have any eyesight problems. Wonder why no one picked this up before publishing. Really creates a big negative about an otherwise great, comprehensive book. I particularly like the preparation time estimate for each recipe, and the source listing in the back, for ingredients and equipment, including phone, address, and website. Overall, a great new cookbook, but the yellow titles--very bad! 5 stars if it wasn't for this."
3,Good recipes but could be more user-friendly,"The Culinary Institute's books on gourmet cooking are a bit more useful friendly since they contain photographs of finished meals and I found them a bit easier to read, but this collection is still worth a look even though it contains some ""rehashed"" recipes - (I think most people already have recipes for sugar cookies and Black Forest Cake) - but quantity of content still makes this worth a purchase. If you collect recipes, you won't want to miss this one."
2,Difficult to Read!,"Oh, my! A decade in the making and more than 1,000 recipes ...thousands of hours testing and retesting...and then, one can't read the titles in the book as they are printed in yellow! Didn't the editors at Houghton Mifflin think about this OBVIOUS problem? For $40, one should be able to read a book! Perhaps Houghton Mifflin will reprint the book in another more readable color - until then, I will not purchase this probably otherwise wonderful book. I had planned on giving it as Christmas and wedding gifts - what a shame! A better choice at $35 is the Best Recipes Cookbook from the editors of Cook's Illustrated - very readable and with additional diagrams and tools to help everyone from the inexperienced cook to the professional chef. I had been anxiously waiting for the Gourmet book - only to be seriously disappointed because it is unbrowsable and unreadable."
2,OK not to have photos but I want to see the recipes,I was so looking forward to this cookbook and expected it to be one that I'd buy in quantity as holiday gifts. Unfortunately the yellow typeface color is virtually unreadable when used for its intended purpose -- following a recipe in kitchen lighting. Am sure the recipes are grand but my copy is going back to the seller to be replaced when the publisher reprints it with a different color of ink. What a shame!
2,blind tasting,Have just returned my copy of Gourmet Cookbook to the bookshhop. Was looking forward to this volume but got so discouraged at having trouble reading the recipe titles that I didn't even attempt a recipe. Perhaps it will be reissued with titles in a legible color. What a waste of a perfect Christmas gift idea.
3,Can't read the titles,"I just received this book and was looking forward to browsing through it, but when I opened it, the yellow recipe titles made it un-browsable. Although it got good reviews, I'm thinking of returning it because it's so hard to read. I can't understand how a reputable magazine and a reputable publisher came up with such a bad typography choice!!"
5,An Instant Classic,"This cookbook is very thouroughly researched and tested with a wide variety of dishes. I love the fact that you will find simple classics mixed with modern recipes. The recipes are in the collection because they are tried, true, and delicious. I have already made a few dishes and they have all been wonderful. I highly reccomend this book - it is an instant classic that will be an integral part of anyone's cookbook collection."
3,"""Unfriendly"" Book Design",I almost sent the book back immediately because I was unable to read the recipe titles because of the unfortunate choice of yellow for the titles. This book is one that can only be used in bright light; it is not a cook book one enjoys scanning.
4,"Yellow: not the best, but not so bad","I was a little hesitant to buy this for my family for Christmas after reading the reviews, but it turns out this is great! My copy does have yellow titles, but they're sort of orangey-yellow, which I'm able to read just fine. (although I agree a different color would have been better) For folks hesitant about buying, I'd suggest thumbing through a copy at a bookstore or a library to see if the yellow text is bothersome. The descriptions of the dish before each recipe are often helpful. The banana-coconut-mac nut bread (599-600) is heavenly and the broccoli, red pepper and cheddar chowder (115) is excellent. Several of the other recipes seem down to earth and just plain good. In any case, it's a fine book, and one that I'm sure I'll use often."
2,Who was the graphic artist for this?,"Yellow headlines? Please. Any graphic artist with even a minimal amount of training knows to stay away from small-size, bright yellow text. The recipe headings can't be read easily in any light, which makes this a difficult book to browse.As for the recipes, I haven't cooked from the book yet but it looks pretty comprehensive.I am going to sell my copy and wait until the publishing house comes to its senses and releases a copy that is actually readable. The designer probably thought the yellow text was edgy and creative, but it's not. It's not functional, and it's a serious detraction from a great cookbook."
2,Invisible recipe titles...,"I thought I might be able to toss the hundreds of Gourmet Magazine issues weighing down my house but no. I cannot read the recipe titles, they are yellow, pale yellow. Makes the book useless, despite how great the recipes probably are. So, until they fix this, save your magazines."
3,Not a Single Photo,"Before you buy this tome online, keep in mind there are no photos. Zero, zip, zilch. While I like the book as a reference, it certainly isnt as colorful and entertaining as a pretentiously touted ""landmark"" cookbook should be. I bought it blind and was so disappointed when it arrived. I found none of the previous reviews helpful--I actually like the yellow lettering. I cant believe no one makes as big a fuss over the lack of photos and illustration"
2,illegible,"The recipes are decent but I cannot see the titles. What ""cool""art director thought that it would be a stroke of post-modern brilliance to print a book that nobody would be able to see? Fire him/her!! What's next,,,invisible ink?will the publisher please send my money back?"
2,Eye appeal ... NOT!,"The visual appeal of this volume did not catch my eye. The source and publisher was enough for me to pick up the volume to take a look. The color of the D/J and ink color caused me to leave it at the bookseller. ""Yellow is not an easy pigment to read. Perhaps when they reprint the book they will also involve an different graphic designer. I enjoy reading and using cookbooks, but not this one."
2,Hate it!,"I am very disappointed with this book! Where are the pictures of some of the recipes? The price of this book, there should be photos of how to do something not bad drawings! I found the intro to be a waste of paper also, those pictures in the hard to see yellow/orange print could of gone behind the text. I have yet to make anything from this book that turned out, which is wierd because I can make the stuff from Gourmet Magazine with no problems! I especially do not like reading a recipe that is turned complicated because they have to be over the top with the wording! I cannot believe I paid for this book!"
3,"Very comfortable, but poor quality","Very comfortable and stylish boots. So comfortable that they quickly became my favorite and I find myself wearing them more often than any other shoes. Unfortunately, the quality leaves to be desired, as they are starting to fall apart only after 3 months of use (which is pretty common with all Sketchers shoes); the shoe lace loops are starting to wear through and/or ripping off of the shoes. I'm trying to see if the vendor will exchange them for another pair as per their 365 days satisfaction guarantee..."
3,the tube doesn't look as its picture,"my mom made me buy her one of these boxes and another one (from the same company) that showed different pictures ad were the same.we haven't use it yet, but, it will make huge cookies."
4,Haunting and Brutally Honest,"How can we ever forget these kids? Sarah's portraits force them into our hearts, making us care -- sometimes for the first time, really -- what happens to them in our nation's neglected public schools. With brutal honesty, Sarah admits she was out to save the world -- but couldn't. With thoughtful analysis, she suggests no mere program, not even the highly-touted, unrealistically optimistic Teach for America, can either. With this admission, she calls for systemic change, for an education system worthy of the name, and for justice in her kids' names. And she does it with lyrical prose and haunting images. A-plus!"
5,amazing,"i dont understand how rims this amazing could cost so little. amazing look at an awesome price. well done amazon, well done. (2000 ford explorer xls w/ 15x7 rims. perfect fit)"
2,Not worth it,"I had high hopes for these knee highs being they are a Spanx product. However, so far two of the pair had a hole over my big toe by the end of the day (first wear). A third pair was a disappointment when one of the knee highs didn't stay put on my calf. I have purchased ""generic"" knee highs from my local supermarket that have lasted months. I will not be buying these again. The reason for two stars rather than one is that I like the shade of these."
5,Best knee highs I've ever tried!,"I know they are only knee highs but they are SPANX!! And they are very expensive. But they are the ""sturdiest"" knee highs I've ever gotten. The top is very substantial--thick, grippy, comfy, wide band. The hose material is also high quality Spanx. Unless you gouge them on something, they will last a long time. I've worn mine 3-4 times and they still look new. And, no, I don't work for the company and am not paid to say this!!"
4,Bought as a gift,"Purchased these as a gift and my aunt really likes them. Have never used myself, but the Spanx brand is great!"
2,Spanx Hi-Knee that don't stay high!!,"Thought since it said Spanx, they would not ride down the leg but they do. Pretty pricy for 2 pair that are not staying up. I already have a drawer full of knee hi's that won't stay up."
1,Flimsy hose,"Sadly, I put my thumb through these getting them out of the package, no where near my leg. I can't recommend them."
4,Where is The Camping Episode and Survival of the Idiots???,It's not the happiest moments without those two! And if I go back to Seasons 1-4 there are several more that should be included. Maybe it would have been a better idea to make the 20 Happiest Moments instead!
4,You have to be a little strange to enjoy this book.,"Cosmos isn't for the average reader who likes their fiction in neat compartments. Rather, it goes off in a stream of consciousness that occasionally seems to get bogged down in the narrator's thoughts, then soars into lycism when describing his surroundings. From the beginning of the book with the sparrow hung on a wire, the writer takes us into the narrator's mind and the people's lives with which he has come in contact. It ends as it begins, with question marks.Read it for a different look at life, but don't read it if you want ""high adventure"" or ""action."""
4,"no deals, mr. bond","No deals, mr. Bond was not the best in the John gardner series but it still had intrigue and mystery. The only fault I find in these books is how easily Bond disposes his adversaries."
5,JAMES BOND IS BACK IN HIS DEADIEST ASSIGNMENT EVER!!!,"No Deals, Mr.Bond has action and love. The bad guy Kolya Chernov a.k.a. Blackfriar is a mad man you cut out tongues in this story. I can't tell you anymore details but if you buy this book you would never want to put it down."
3,Time to clean house.,"Less typical of other Bond novels, No Deals deals with the betrayal, infighting, and backstabbing that occurs in all governmental agencies. More intrigue oriented than action packed."
2,Smaller than expected,Fairly decent powder but for the price paid you don't get a lot. I won't buy another.
4,"Trinkets, zakka and cute stuff","This book is nice but it isn't what I expected. If you are looking for cute trinkets and things I would look elsewhere. There is a cute site on ebay with Decole now. very, very cute stuff....just search under ""decole"""
2,Didn't work for me,"This glare-filter didn't work for me because I was trying to reduce glare from a large window behind me, not glare from the screen itself. Because the surface of this filter is highly reflective, it actually worsened my screen-viewing problem by amplifying the glare rather than counteracting it. Even though the filter did not work for my needs, it is well-made and very easy to assemble."
3,Good Screen Cover If You Have an Older Monitor,"It works great, but it doesn't stay up very well on newer, slimmer monitors. I had to package tape it onto my monitor, and eventually that all came apart."
5,Little book packed with BIG information,"A book on time, for those who don't have enough time!!Karen shows you how to cut through ""our to busy schedules""to carve out the time we need for what's the most valueduse of our time. How to use your time to achieve your dreamsand to handle the stress that seems to fill our lives.In these days of hurry and stress, Karen's book is a calmingvoice of reason offering a positive approach to dealing withour all to busy schedules"
5,Make the most of your time!,"Time by Karen H. Whiting is crammed with immensely helpful tips, both practical and spiritual, to help busy women make the most of their time. It's also packaged in a highly attractive format that can be scanned quickly for the helpful suggestions Whiting offers and is concise enough to absorb quickly. What makes it so attractive, in addition to the simple, logical layout, is that the text is interspersed with pictures and backgrounds that are restful to the eye. Even better, it's just the right size to tuck into your purse to read when you're stuck somewhere and have a few minutes to spare.Time and its companion book The Home are the first two books of the Secrets of Success for Women Series. They are indeed SOS whether you are a working or stay-at-home mom, wife, or single professional. I highly recommend them!"
4,Excellent for the avocational woodworker,"I bought this for exactly the reasons Delta lists: I find their 8"" drill press too small for any useful work, but the 12"" is overpriced for what you get. So I bought the 10"". I've owned it for a few months now and have used it extensively. It has plenty of power - all but the largest forstner bits in all but the hardest wood cut smoothly and cleanly with this press. My only real compaint is the difficulty of adjusting the angle of the table - it requires a wrench and is fairly rough. However, the depth-stop adjustment is smooth and elegant, the table height adjustment is adequate, and the speed changes (via belt changes) are quite simple once you've got the hang of it. Workmanship of the tool is excellent."
1,poor motor,"I have this drill press and have used it twice without incident. On the third time the motor burned up in smoke. As it's now out of warranty, I will have to eat the cost of a new motor at $130. I will likely buy a different machine. While most of my shop tools are Delta, I think they missed something with this drill press and I caution others to check part replacement costs before they buy any such item."
3,SOLAR GETS THREE STAR,"This cover works well, but sort of difficult to get off without getting rain water that has settled on the top. It has a string that tightens it around which hold it on well to keep leaves and other stuff out, but difficult for a smaller person to remove by themselves."
4,Encourages Sisters to be Friends,"This book places a high value on sisters taking care of each other, but does so without being preachy. My girls enjoyed this book, and have requested it many times. It is an older story, but I think it would still be a good addition to a children's story collection."
5,Lovely,"My grandma used to read me this book when I was younger and became a big sister for the first time. Now that my youngest sister (she's six, I'm 21) is about to be a big sister I thought she would be able to enjoy this book too. It was my favorite growing up and I think I read it at least once a day. I'm happy to be able to pass on the love."
2,Disappointing - these are abbreviated versions of the songs,"As far as the record goes, the performances are wonderful. But -- there are many songs missing from the Three Penny Opera, and those that are included are sometimes presented in an abbreviated form. For instance, Barbara Song only has the last verse -- missing the wonderful wordplay and contrast with the earlier two verses."
3,An Excellent Document,"The review the complains of the abbreviated versions of the songs that are included on this CD, and that some of the songs are missing, misses the point. The Barbara song, which is mentioned by name, was set up by the Moritatssaenger in a way which makes it clear that the song was also truncated on the original 78 release from 1930...Listen to this for what it's worth: it's great documentary, and includes two Mahoganny songs, some songs by Hollaender, etc...(also, check out the 1999 release of the Threepenny Opera on BMG, with Nina Hagen as Frau Peachum...)"
4,I Love Threepenny.,"I've loved the ""Three Penny Opera"" since I was associated with a production in college. This is a fine CD of the original Berlin cast.Also, there are some French versions, some sung by Brecht, and some other Berlin songs of the day by Kurt Gerron, Marlene Dietrich, et al."
2,OVER AND OVER AGAIN,"Boring and sundry, this lazy triad ripped off everyone from Zepplien to Big Star, and did so without even a modicum of success. Tim thought it was the greatest music ever, and he thought he was the greatest lover ever. Nothing cold ever be further from the truth! I hate you! And you owe me sixty dollars idiot!"
3,Memory is merciful,"Had a few Budgie records in my collection when I grew up. No when I listen to them 25 years (or so) later it's not that good anymore. ""Parents"" is worth to move to your iPod though."
3,PASS ON THIS ONE,THIS THING COLLECTS MORE DUST THAN MY LAPTOP PLUS THE OUTSIDE COMPARTMENT RIPPED AND HAS A BIG HOLE IN IT FIND A BETTER ONE
5,Great item,This item is an exceptional tool. Does what it is advertised to do with ease and is well constructed
4,Great Bowl!!,"This is an excellent basic pasta bowl of the type you might see in a high end Italian restaurant. It's not a fancy design but its perfect for presenting pasta or soup, amd large enough to make it a main course."
5,Nifty inexpensive cookie press,My old metal screw press finally bit the dust and of course it is Spritz time so while picking up some last minute items I saw this at Meijer on sale - hey $13.00 worth a try. Brought it home made the recipe provided and the cookies came out great - the dough was perfect just right follow the directions. Yes the plastic concerns me but it isn't cookie maker I'd use day in and day out. I didn't wash it in the dishwasher but rather by hand - I would be concerned that the plastic would warp - though I suppose top shelf would be fine.
1,Great until the handle cracks,"It makes great cookies and works well. After having a batter powered one, I much preferred this caulk-gun style (easier and more consistent). However, I am on my third (and final) of this style. The plastic handle, at the hinge, has cracked and broken off after one year of use on all three. Now I am looking at an all metal style."
4,Great cookie press,It worked very well. Easy to use. It was very basic and that was a good thing. The price was reasonable as well.
1,Plastic is poor quality,"Have not had it very long, but yet the plastic hinge cracked. Don't waste your money, buy an all metal unit... Don't they test these things?"
2,Ho-hum,"The title of this book is misleading. It's just another ""How to Garden"" book. There are lots of these on the market, some better than others. This isn't a good one. More than half the book is Plant Directory - the usual listing of garden plants and the rest is the usual information about planning, composting, weed control etc. There are lots of colour photos.The section on planning a garden has pictures of stylized gardens surrounding little doll houses with no allowance for a driveway and no sign of neighbours. They seemed unrealistic and not helpful. I've read this writer's other book and quite liked it - not sure what went wrong here."
5,"Harnoncourt Brahms? Harnoncourt Brahms??? Yes, Yes!!!!!","Having listened to, and loved much of Harnoncourt's early work, Bach on original instruments, and having not really taken to his Beethoven or Schubert, I am completely, overwhelmingly, amazed at how much I enjoyed these performances. Is it the leaner textures? Even if so, it is also due to the lack of extreme, indiosyncratic tempo changes Harnoncourt is sometimes inclined to take. For the most part, the tempos are relatively, rock-solid steady, and, although Brahms himself (in response to hearing Toscanini live) felt compelled to allow for conductorial license (supposedly comparing his pulse rate to that of his more negative companion at the concert) to me this is the way Brahms should go, but minus the turgid, often pompous thickness his instrumentation can display. Harnoncourt seems to have struck therefore an ideal balance between classicism and romanticism, which is what Brahms is essentially all about. BRAVO!!!"
5,The dramatic conclusion to the Cheney Duvall Md books.,"This book is the 8th book in the set and the last book of the Cheney Duvall Md books. It is about Shilo who has found out who his family is and a woman Dr. Shilo is a Nurse, a buisnessman, a plantation owner in Hawaii, and owns a shiping company. Cheney (the Dr.) is a great Doctor, comes from a wealty family, a Christian, and is in love with Shilo. She knows that Shilo loves her too, but that she can not marry him. The reason is they have different views on faith.Shilo also has a cousin that hates him because Shilo inherited his fathers' money and buisness. Not to mention because Shilo is the man Bain (Shilos cousin) wants to be. So Bain plots to destroy Cheney and Shilo. Will he get his revenge on Shilo and Cheney? Will Shilo finally become a Christian? Will they Get married? I will leave that for the book to tell.(P.S. Lynn Morris has started a new series with these two awesome characters. It is called Where Two seas Meet.)"
4,Good stuff!,"...but not quite what I've been used to. I LOVED it, don't get me wrong, but I think that those who have complained about the difference in Shiloh's character have a point. However, I didn't like Island of the Innocent quite as much at the first reading, either (and I have but 15 minutes ago finished my first reading of this), and then it grew on me with successive readings. Thanks, Lynn and Gilbert, for not ending the story with this! I am REALLY looking forward to the ""Cheney and Shiloh"" series."
3,Okay but kind of a let-down,"I'm going to have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers here. I've been reading the Cheney Duvall books for the characters (not for the writing, which is less-than-stellar) and I was disappointed by the weakening of the characters in this book. I felt Shiloh's scandalous behaviour to be less than convincing (but I realize they were _trying_ to make him seem wicked). I thought the ""harrowing"" climax of the book was contrived and almost ridiculous. In all, I was glad to know what was happening with these characters, but I think _Island of the Innocent_ was a much better-written book. It will be interesting to see what happens in the ""Cheney and Shiloh"" series."
3,alternate to gluing a jigsaw,"This is a good alternate to gluing a jigsaw puzzle. It wasn't messy at all. Although, it is still delicate when attempting to place it in a frame."
3,Not enough,"I recently bought this product and i realized that is not enough for my puzzle of 2000 pieces, now i will have to buy another one, more that i pay for the puzzle itself..."
5,Puzzle Presto!!!,"Very fun Item!! My mother and I put the sticky things in my Las Vegas Blvd puzzle. It was easy as the Most helpful review said. Well, it wiggled when we were done. But Overall, Great product!! Buy it!! Electric Bird Out!!!"
4,Great for hanging puzzles!,This is all I have found that works well and easily to get a puzzle ready to hang.
3,not bad but......,Maybe i got a bad one but it didn't fill up the 1000 piece puzzle like it states and it doesn't hold up very well. as i transferred my puzzle from condo to car it fell apart. also the tape wasn't enough to tape the puzzle appropriately so i had to improvise. overall would not get this product again
4,"Better than glue, but...","This product is much better than puzzle glue, which I tried first. However, it is still not stiff enough to hang without a frame or attaching some stiffer backing."
1,puzzle presto/PUZZLE ORDER,"I PURCHASED TWO 1,000 PIECE PUZZLES,PUZZLE PRESTO AND ROLL UP MAT FOR PUZZLE...MAT WAS A PIECE OF FELT I COULD HAVE JUST GOTTEN...PUZZLE PRESTO DIDN'T HOLD 1,000 PIECE TOGETHER LIKE IT SAID...PUZZLES WERE GREAT!!"
3,Annoying,"Puzzle Presto works exactly as advertised. But peeling the backing off without pulling up the paper holding the adhesive is ANNOYING and difficult. It would be nice if the backing extended a bit beyond the adhesive to give one a grip, but I suspect that would raise the manufacturing cost considerably. But until that happens, I'm going back to puzzle glue."
1,.JUNK !!,would get again..doesnt peel off..rather just buy 2 roles of duck tape..tried to peel off backing and it just didnt work..it seems like it was old!!
4,A very good and easy way to save your puzzle,We used this for a 1000 piece puzzle which was 20x27 and it was great. Very easy to use and we have also been able to hang it with the adhesive hanging hooks that came in the box. I m very happy with it.
3,puzzle poster,This product work very well. I used it to lock the puzzle together so I could put it in a poster frame. The puzzles are of motorcycle that i will hang in my gerage.
5,Easy as 1 2 3,"This is the first time I have used this product and it was very easy. I love it! There is no need to use any type of chemical or glue. The picture keeps it's integrity. My grandaughter and I had a lot of fun using it.Tip - in order to use this product, you have to turn over your puzzle.Use the easy to remove tape that is included and tape the edges and across the puzzle.Slide newspaper under the puzzle.Place another newspaper on top of puzzle, and tape both newspapers together.Slide cardboard under puzzle and a piece of cardboard on top and flip over.It sounds complicated but it really isn't. It's really easy once you get the hang of it.Try it. You'll never use puzzle glue again."
1,puzzle saver?,"I do jigsaw puzzles all the time and usually just take them apart and put them back in the box to do again at a later time. I recently purchased two puzzles that I wanted to preserve and frame. The puzzle presto looked like a better alternative than the other puzzle preservers on the market. While using it I kept thinking to myself that I could have done the same thing with a roll of contact paper. The two 'hangers' supplied in the box are, in my opinion, useless. They are nothing more than a piece of thin plastic - the same cheap piece of plastic used to hang merchandise in stores. I don't know how the company expects people to hang their finished puzzles, but even without a frame these 'hangers' would not support the weight of a 1000 piece puzzle. I definitely would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,frustrating,"This product must be applied to back of the puzzle. It was impossible to turn the puzzle over in one piece even with the help of large pieces of cardboard to slide on and put on top to flip.Also, one box did not have enough sheets for the 1000 piece puzzle."
4,slippers international mens deerskin,"These slippers are one of the better investments this year.I say investment,because they were a bit more than I would usually spend on slippers.Right out of the box I was impressed with the quality.The sole is of a non-slip variety.The overall construction is quality workmanship and materials.They are almost more of a ""house shoe"" than a slipper,yet VERY comfortable.After having recent surgery,I wear them most of the time.They seem like they will have a very long life.I would recommend these to any one! Just remember...you only get what you pay for."
3,Disappointing,They were sturdy enough but the fit was not good and the deerskin was really not very nice. They were returned.
2,"Disappointing, Unacceptable","I wanted a comfortable, shearling, leather moccasin. The upper part of these moccasins was leather, but the upper part of the right moccasin had been cut for a left moccasin. Also, the shearling wool seemed man-made, not sheep-made. And neither moccasin was comfortable.I returned the product to Amazon within its 30-day limit, and they promptly refunded the purchase price. I appreciated how easy they made it to buy, try out, and return a product, in this case without a shipping charge either way."
5,Great men's slipper,This slipper came in many sizes (size 14 is very hard to find in stores) and is a comfortable and warm slipper. Nice color and heavy-duty sole. Warm lining.Recommended !
5,Mens slippers,"As a gift, these slippers are perfect. My husband has not worn any other shoe in the house since receiving them on Christmas morning. He says they are very comfortable. These slippers appear to be well made and very sturdy. I expect them to last a long time, and be well worth the money."
5,Electric Impact Wrench,PROS: This tool works great. Needed something that would loosen the blade on my lawn edger and this is the tool that was needed.CONS: None
3,Ooh...!,"This is old media, which is hard to find. The discs ""worked"" in my old G4 DVD drive, so I'm elated!"
1,Can be opened with a tube of toilet paper and a ballpoint pen.,"It appears that one can unlock this product without the key: All you need is a bit of cardstock (or used toilet-paper tube) and a ballpoint pen. For more information on this vulnerability, search for ""kensington lock vulnerability"" on Google."
1,"Poorly made, instructions unclear, may have damaged my laptop","I'd recommend selecting a different security cable product, especially if you have a PowerBook or MacBook. This one is poorly made, even more poorly documented, and may have permanently damaged my PowerBook G4. (Yes, the product web site claims this model is compatible with the PB G4.)It's unclear from the cryptic instruction diagram on the back of the packaging which direction is locked and which is unlocked. (Hey, would it be so bad to actually use *words* to explain things? Even in 4 or 5 languages if you like. The diagrams make no sense.)In the process of trying to get this to work, it appears that the locking teeth chewed up the security slot of my PowerBook. It may have permanently damaged the slot. Needless to say, I will attempt to return the product for a refund.There are plenty of similar products on the market, including others avaiable through Amazon. I'd suggest trying one of those."
4,Key is not as pictured,"Thing that bothered me most was that the key was not as pictured in the official photograph. It's larger, and has a larger plastic tab that seems to serve no purpose other than to advertise HP's logo. This doesn't affect the functionality of lock, but it is an inconvenience. Photo of this has been posted.Hard to test how strong this lock is, but my laptop hasn't been stolen yet, so it seems to work. It functions more as a visual deterrent, as I'm sure anyone with a pair of bolt cutters could easily get though.Not sure when this lock came out, but I've heard that the ol' pen + toilet paper roll trick doesn't work on the newer models of locks. Just FYI. I did not test this myself.Overall, it serves it's purpose, so it seems good. I paid thirty-one dollars for this."
2,"Not good for 13"" Macbook","Bought this for my daughters 13"" Macbook. When I tried to anchor it into the slot on the Macbook, once I turned the key it made the plastic frame on the macbook, bow out. I initially thought that I did something wrong trying to latch it onto the laptop, but it kept on happening. I even called Apple and they said that the lock should be ok for use with the laptop. I got nervous anyway, and decided to return. I ended up going to Apple and buying a Kensigton lock from them for about $7 more. This one has a rubber gasket on the end of the lock near where the lock inserts into the port....absolutely no problems.. fits like a glove. Therefore, I would not recomment this for the 13"" Macbook."
3,"Bad design, no instructions","What could be simpler than securing your laptop with a cable lock? I bought this product and a year later, was still trying to figure out how to get it to work. I am able to 'lock' and 'unlock' the unit easily by itself, but it just would not lock when I inserted it into the slot on my laptop. The pin looks non-standard when compared to some of the cable locks I have seen before, and does not turn when inside the slot.Months later, I finally cracked the case. I had to push - really push hard - so that the locking part would enter far enough into the laptop security slot. This would happen through a compression of the little piece of rubber that sits against the laptop.At least, I can use the cable now! Phew!"
5,...but you missed the point...,"Of course on-base and slugging percentages are much better measures of a hitter's worth, but that's not the author's point. He wants to take a particular statistic and show how it should be interpreted/reinterpreted, given the vagaries of time, location, etc. He could easily have chosen on-base, slugging, OPS, whatever, but batting average traditionally is the first one everyone looks at, as ill-informed as that may be. Implied is that the same arguments can be used for any of the other statistics. (And he does so, briefly providing the results.)"
2,Batting average as the sole measurement of hitting ability?,"This book spends a great deal of time making (very reasonable) adjustments to the batting averages of baseball players. That's fine, but the problem is that batting average is a terrible measurement of offensive ability. It's less important than on-base percentage (OBP), and it's less important than slugging percentage (SLG) and thus, by implication, any reasonable measurement that combines OBP and SLG.What a waste of time to go inte such depths when only looking into a terrible predictor of offensive ability."
4,Adidas 2007 El Moro Mountain Bike Shoe,"This is a nice shoe, though I was hoping it would be more walking friendly. No apparent problems thus far."
5,One of our all-time favorites,"Our children are 10 and almost 4. We started reading this book to our older child when he was about 3, and we're still reading it as a regular bedtime story to our children. None of us tires of it. We have probably over a hundred children's books in our home, and this one rises to the top. When I noticed that this book was out of print, I decided to write the review hoping that it may help to influence someone to re-print it. Thank you, Daniel Pinkwater."
3,British TV: sort of an English version Magnum P.I.,"Lovejoy is a private investigator with his own variegated crewthat include a British Lady, a monk and a security guard.Here he takes the case of a Peruvian gold ring and finds trouble with an high tech retinal scan safe.The action is tame compared to American TV."
3,NOW JUST MAKE IT INTO A DVD,They still sell VHS players? Release this on DVD and I'll buy every single episode.
5,MORE LOVEJOY!!!,I want to see more Lovejoy Mysteries and have them available on DVD!My favorite tv series!
5,madolin strings,"These strings are just what I expected from Martin. Good sounding strings. Amazon had a very good time from purchase to the door, about three days regular shipping."
2,too tinny,"I have the Fender FM-63S f-style mandolin. These strings are VERY tight and tinny sounding, but are reasonably loud. Perhaps this is what you're going for, but to me they sound cheap. Go with the Elixer Polyweb strings. They may not last as long but sound amazing. These stretch too tightly for my taste, and therefore make it difficult to pick individual notes. Would not buy again."
2,Handel in a hurry.,"Handel's Ode to St. Cecilia's Day is a fantastic work. The text - based in Dryden - is really well writen, and Handel shows his genius clearly. Harnoncourt is a eficient maestro; there are no doubt about it (if you have, try to hear him conducting the Concentus musicus Wien in the OP album ""Musik am Habsburgischem Kaiserhof"", loaded with wonderfull works by Fux and Schmelzer). But this time something is missing. There are the feeling that all musicians and choir are in a hurry to end the music and go quickly home to sip a beer. There are no interaction with the work, they do not understand Handel and do not care. To perform Handel well you must understand the work and love it, or at least like it. Here they are indiferent. I say pass. Save your money and get (quickly) the superior version by Bernstein, still available (Sony Classics) wich are the real Ode to St. Cecilia's Day, performed with full knowledge by NY PO. And remember, with Bernstein you can't go wrong."

2,If it worked as good as it looks.,"The short story is that my first purchase of this drill was that the hammer function failed after 20 or so holes. Thinking it a fluke, I accepted a replacement. However, I would trade the speed (used for smaller drill bits) for torque. 7/8 auger drill 2/3 into a 4x6 jammed."
5,Never laughed so hard,Listened while in the car. My wife and I had tears running down our face. Where can we purchase CD?
5,Don White's Hilarious!!!!!!!!,The seller is reliable. Product came as described. Shipped quickly and nicely packaged. Thanks for a great deal.
2,Stereotyping without an real understanding,"A good percentage of the evidence he presents regarding fans of the medium is anecdotal, gathered from employees of one particular comic shop in the midwest. Pustz' view of Comic Book Culture is clearly that of one who makes no real effort to understand the topic... Overall, it paints all comics fans in a negative light, which will not help the already-struggling industry in the least."
5,A great introductory study,"Pustz has done a wonderful job analyzing the audiences of comic books. While not as theoretical as some of the scholarly works on popular culture and its users (such as can be found on topics like film or rock and roll), this is a benefit, since it is the first for its topic. While not useful as a general history of comics (as noted by the previous reviewer), it was not intended as such, and this would be an excellent supplementary book."
2,With Scanty Capacity,"Maybe this was an interesting book when written 10 years ago, but the dynamics of comic book culture have changed significantly in the ensuing decade to basically render this an obsolete text. I had a few other problems with the book as well-namely, the author seems to only have visited 2 comic book stores and NO conventions in his research-that's just poor form when you're writing a book on comic book culture."
4,A much needed biography,Miss Bertha: Woman of Revival tells the story of one of the most amazing women Baptists have ever produced. Bertha Smith lived 100 years and influenced several generation of missionaries and pastors. Drummond does a good job of focusing mainly on her public life while still giving us a glimpse at her early years. Everyone should read this book!
2,Not what I expected,"I'm a mom of 3 young boys who love Hamtaro, so I ordered this house to give as a Christmas gift. I would recommend this toy only if your kids are REALLY good at pretend play. The house is very small, comes with only 1 hamster (Hamtaro) and I really didn't feel it was worth the money---I ended up returning mine."
5,If possible even a six star RATING!!!,"Even though my mom did not want to buy it for me @ 1st, my little sis and I saved enough lunch money to buy it. Anyho' this is the best toy I have ever had. It comes with Hamtaro and some accesories to play with like a swing and a see-saw. I have all of the Ham-Ham toys sets, the house, and both Bijou's and Hamtaro playsets. In other words I only need the plush toys and all of the DVD'S. I love Hamsters and I will not sell those toys in my life time. Hamtaro ROX!!!"
3,Excellent coverage of political and institutional theories,Great book on political theories for beginners and also for the people with knowledge of various political reforms with in an institution.
3,They Are Adequate,"As the other reviews stated these are a little wobbly. That being said they seem to be able to hold up pretty well in spite of that. So if you are cutting a steak the thing will move back and forth but it doesn't seem to suggest it's going to fall over or apart. They are small so a plate and a glass is about the max it can hold. We got these for thanksgiving this year in a mad rush to allow for the extra people that were coming. They worked well but we got comments on the wobble. Such as ""I hope you didn't pay much for these things"". Well, we didn't so I guess it's all good. We use them a lot and they are any more wobbly than they were when we first got them so in the end they are adequate."
1,SEVERAL ITEMS BROKEN A TRAY TABLE AND THE STAND . WHAT AN EMBARRASSING GIFT,"AS I ALREADY COMPLAINED, THIS WAS SOLD BY AMAZON STORE DR OK BY AND ON CHRISTMAS WAS OPENE AS A GIFT TO FIND A LEG BROKEN ON THE STAND AS WELL AS A BROKEN TRAY TABLE. NOW I HAVE TO MAKE THIS RIGHT BUT I WILL NOT ASK FOR THE GIFT BACK. WHAT JUNK AND SOLD BY AMAZON LESS. THAT SHOCKS ME."
2,lightweight,"finish is nice, but, one table already has a broken leg from folding and ordinary use! Seems to be very cheaply made."
2,Poor Quality,"I read the reviews before I purchased but went ahead and ignored the low stars. I should have listened. The wood is soft and so poor packaging left all but one table marred as though it had been used for years. I was primarily interested in the tables doing their job so I could look past this though I wasn't happy about it. So I set up everything and put up every table... they all are so poorly constructed that they wobble badly. Forget trying to do any kind of drawing on these and if you're using them for your food and drink at dinner time, well, be VERY careful. You might have it all fall to the floor."
4,NOT tacky TV trays!,"For the price, these tables are very good quality. We use them often, and they tuck out of the way easily. I'm very pleased."
2,Really cheap,The wood is really soft and easy to break. They feel really really cheap. Was a gift so we kept them.
4,Really Like This!,I was a bit doubtful that this would actually work but decided to give it a try. I've only had a chance to use it once (to chop up cilantro) and it did a nice job. Haven't tried it yet for stripping rosemary and thyme leaves off the stems but will likely use that feature tomorrow.
4,read for language practice,"I got this to practice my foreign language reading skills. Since I was already familiar with the characters and settings in Arizona and Seattle from reading some of the author's other books in English, I found it helpful.My language skills are not sufficient to comment on the quality of the translation, only that it was interesting and I was able to make it through and follow the story line with minimal help.I would like to see a wider selection of novels available in other languages like this."
3,Bruckner Lite-OK Live Recording,"This is the first Bruckner I've heard on period instruments, but the result is more cuious than convincing. The outer movements lack urgnecy or mystery in Herreweghe's hands, and instead come off rather bouncy, a word which I would not have thought could be applied to Bruckner. The Adagia is solemn but lacking in passion. The Scherzo is pretty good. The recording job is OK. It's a stealth 'live' job, since nowhere on the box or notes does it acutally say so, but on headphone the audiance presence is clear."
2,Keep your politics neutral,"I'm probably not going to buy any more books by Sara Paretsky. She continues to muddy up what could be enjoyable detective mysteries with her liberal politics. It's okay to have opinions, but the first rule of authorship is to not use your work of fiction to showcase your personal politics and certainly not shove them down the reader's throat. I just don't enjoy reading page after page of her bashing Christianity, Republican government, organized law enforcement agencies, and the so-called upper class. Okay, we all know where you stand on the issues, Ms. Peretsky, and while some readers will certainly agree with you, I think it beyond wreckless to slant your stories to such a degree that you are without doubt alienating half your readers - some, like me, to the point they've decided it's just no longer worth it to have to pick through your personal prejudices to get to the story."
2,Disappointing,"This is my first Paretsky novel. I kept scratching my head wondering if this was supposed to be a didactic type of story focussed as a teaching model for adolescents. I see now that it was not- just a preachy, confusing story. No thanks."
2,Blacklist this one....,"Sara and V.I. need to take a long break. This was a plodding, boring, confused attempt to write a ""socially relevant"" novel. It takes a particular skill to blend genres successfully and this was not an example of a book that succeeded. Fortunately it was borrowed so the only thing I spent poorly was time."
1,Tedious,"Oh joy! A new V.I. book...at last a big, thick novel to burrow into to forget my own problems and those of the world. Gosh, did I get it wrong! If I had saved the receipt, I would taken advantage of the money-back guarantee.I buy novels to escape and here Paretsky dumps her political views, which are confused at best, on my front doorstep like a case of stinking fish. These days you can't turn on the radio or tv or read a newspaper without being assaulted by political vitriol. Now we have to be worried about novels. I think we need a new rating - HPC - heavy political content.I slogged through the rhetoric to see if my guess was correct but didn't buy the ending - it was just too tidy. And by the time I got there, I really didn't care. I was just glad it was over. I closed this book feeling very unsatisfied and very disappointed.If this is what we can expect in the future from Paretsky, I will get the book from the library so I can return it when my eyes glaze over in boredom."
1,Very disappointing....,"I am such a fan of Sara Paretsky and the V.I. Warshaski series and eagerly started reading this book. I can't begin to say how disappointed I was in this dreary, boring book. I made myself finish the book in the hopes that it would get better and the V.I. that I had come to know and love would reappear. Sadly, that did not happen. I sure hope Ms. Paretsky has something better in mind for her next book."
2,Hard to Follow,"I used to enjoy the V.I. Warshawski novels, but no more. Blacklist has too many characters, none of which I really cared about. The plot was very confusing and somewhat contrived. The only reason I am finishing this book is because I paid for it and I can't afford not to read it. But no more V.I. Warshawski for me."
3,Ponderously Political,"I had wanted to read a V.I. Warshawski novel for some time, so when one presented itself to me at an airport I grabbed it. I found myself having to constantly work through my feelings on the Patriot act. Certainly I do not feel that all people of Arab descent shoud be suspect- enough already. I wanted to read a mystery about a sexy P.I.. Then I find myself dealing with issues of class and race- What? I'll try one more in the series."
2,Definitely not a page-turner!,"I have read and enjoyed all the other V.I.Warshawski books, but this one is challenging me to finish it. I am 3/4 of the way, but all the loose threads are just taking too long to come together. The characters are not likeable, there is no love interest, and I am not motivated to get to the conclusion. Not her best book."
2,"Less talk, more action","I am a huge Sara Paretsky fan and could not wait to read VI's latest adventure. Unfortunately, this book was a big disappointment. Rather than racing through the pages, I find myself slogging along, trying to keep track of too many characters with similar names and annoying personalities. My guess is that if this book was Paretsky's first, it would have ended up in the rejection pile. The author obviously is upset about events after 9/11 which have led to many individuals of Middle Eastern background being detained as possible terrorists. She tries to link these current events with the blacklisting of the 1950s, but back then, no one was crashing planes into skyscrapers. I find it curious that Paretsky would risk alienating a good part of her audience with such a liberal stance. Please get VI off her soapbox and back to detecting."
4,interesting viewpoint,"Contrary to many of the other reviews I did not find this book too political. It was refreshing to see another American view point from the one we often perceive - that the ends justify the means and constitutional rights must be suspended (or, in the case of non-Americans, don't always apply).It's not unusual for Paretsky's books to set up a target for attack. It's a while since I read the last one, but if my memory is right I recall attacks on the pharmaceutical industry, the Church, big business etc.I certainly don't always agree with what she says, as sometimes it can be expressed in very black and white terms and I do find VI a bit of whinger, but she is always both entertaining and thought provoking, no less so than in this book."
1,Paretsky - the LAST,"I've avidly read the VI novels over the years, even enjoyed the movie version -- but this will be the LAST I ever read. The 'classic VI' storyline has finally been reduced to mass-regurgitation of characters, formulaic conversations and incidents. The final straw in this book is the total submerging of any faint 'new' plot in a naieve, wandering , nonsensical political diatribe.Save your money for a REAL author."
2,Who's going to blacklist V.I?,"Who's gonna tell the Crown Princess of Crime Novels that she's gotta put out or get off the throne?At one point in the novel ""Blacklisting,"" the infamous although not really all that interesting P.I. V.I. Warshawski, remarks that she needs more friends. Truer words were never spoken.Paretsky, in her 20-something V.I. novels, has spent too little effort developing V.I.'s character and supporting cast. So aside from her doctor friend Lottie, we find history to be Paretsky's crutch because she can't come up with a suitably well-rounded life for V.I. Or, if V.I. is meant to be a ""tortured loner"" type, then let's see that angle worked up.While the Federal Theater Project's history is interesting, it's not interesting enough to hold a plot together. In fact, that should be V.I's job. But Paretsky seems more tired than usual and more than ever resting on her reputation. But if one looks back to the first books in the series, one might find the same problem."
1,Total Loser,"If you want to read left-wing propoganda then this is the book for you. This series is in serious need of a transfusion, and this book doesn't offer it. If you haven't read this book, skip it."
4,Engrossing but ultimately disappointing,"Another engrossing read from a true professional. Paretsky never fails to deliver a riveting read. Although, this one is not quite up to her previous standards, it is still far and away above most of the mysteries the most popular authors churn out.There wasn't as much fleshing out of characters as she usually does but perhaps, that is because I really missed reading so little about Lottie and Max."
1,Much Ado about nothing,"At least I can't cry about the money I spent, since I do use the library almost exclusively. To say this book was too long and too boring would be to simplify things. And how does a character become such a big part of the story when he wasn't even there? I am referring to lost lover Morrell. If V.I. makes a profit in her crazy investigative career it's a miracle. Massage's and motels for a few hours rest, 3 traffic tickets for overparking because she couldn't get back to her car in time, just a few examples. What was the big coverup anyway to justify 3 murders. Livestyles of the rich and famous, you can keep it."
2,Was this ghost written?,"I had really looked forward to this new mystery from one of myfavorite writers who's created an intelligent, wry, and observant protagonist in V.I. Warshawski. This book disappoints with an extremely convoluted plot involving too many characters. There's very little fun in reading Blacklist. V.I. lacks much of her sharper wit shown in earlier adventures and Blacklist reads as a poor summary of the low points in 20th Century social history. I only finished reading it because I hoped to find some of the pleasure I felt in previous V.I. novels."
2,time for Paretsky to fade away?,"Oh, what a dreary series this has become. The plots are more mechanical and more contrived, the coincidences more forced, the ""free in every box"" politcal polemics more windy. If you were disappointed in the last couple of books, beware: this one's slid another couple of notches downhill. Pity. Plucky Vic deserves better."
1,400 more pages of this?,"I quit around page 40. I was attracted by the hook to blacklisting. In the first 40 pages, I went through 4 banal scenes: the lover in Afghanastan, the meeting with the client, the trip around the grounds of an abandoned mansion, and the meeting with the old woman. Not one memorable sentnce, not one clever insight. I'm in awe of anyine who made it through 450 pages of this."
1,Left Wing Harangue,An interesting story - if you can wade through the left wing harangue. It is quite monotonous and makes the counterpoint of the plot almost an afterthought. I got about 2/3 through it and quit!!
3,Secrets Can Kill,"An author of crime fiction would be better served to keep politics away from the lives of the characters.Sara Baretsky's BLACKLIST keeps V.I. Warshawski on the move, but at times entices the reader to skip paragraphs that do not move the story along.A nice visit with an old favorite who introduced us to women private detectives, but V.I. should return to her old haunts.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
2,tedious,"Although I have enjoyed Paretsky's other books, the plot of this one was too complicated, with too many characters. The political/historical commentary about the blacklisting in the 1950's was especially tedious. And, the final resolution was rather unbelievable. Overall, the novel would have been more enjoyable in a shorter, cleaner version."
3,"Interesting Political Tie-In, But Too Long!","I think it's very interesting that the writer, through V.I., takes a political stand (rather unusual in a mystery, I think) and makes a link between 50's McCarthyism and the Bush Era post-9/11 Patriot Act climate. Because of this viewpoint I think it's fairly predictable that those with leanings to the right will not like this book and those with leanings to the left will be more inclined to like it. I count myself in the latter category, but even so I thought the book was WAY too long and needed some good editing - I think it would have been a much better book."
2,What a long drawn out story,"I listened to the audiobook unabridged version. It was over 15 hours long. What a long drawn out story. The subplot of the ""Egyptian boy"" served no purpose other than give the writer an opportunity to give her feelings of the Patriot Act. It is troubling legislation and I am fearful of the abuse that can happen. I think she is a skillful writer who could have gotten more thoughtful attention to the Patriot Act with less rhetoric.I had to force myself to listen to the last quarter of the book to find out ""who dun it"" because at around chapter 35, I no longer cared. There were a lot of characters. I had to make notes to remember who was who. I just can't understand why this book was so wordy-the characters were not that complex (just too many), and didn't require added insight. This is my second V.I. Warshawski novel, and probably my last."
3,Not too Bad- but Not Satisfying Either,"This is my first VI Warshawski novel. I am quite impressed by Paretsky's writing ability, and enjoyed the book mainly because I think she possesses a great command of the English language. I'm also a sucker for any book involving spooky houses which is why I bought this in the first place.The story itself was a disappointment. The pace is way too sluggish and the ending is unsatisfying. I think that someone who publishes such a long novel should at least reward their readers with a whopper of an ending, which this one fails to deliver. The characters are dry, and I did not find myself empathizing with any of them. I wasn't as troubled by the writer's political rants as other reviewers were, because at one point in the story Warshawski comes out and admits she is a hot-head who lets emotions come before logic (which sort of puts all her political opinions into perspective doesn't it?)."
5,Riveting and relevant,"This is a book you will be thinking about long after you turn the last page. The plotline was riveting, and the way current events are woven into the unfolding mystery is both interesting and disturbing. I can't wait to read Paretsky's next book."
1,Was this an essay or a novel?,"This book was given to me as a gift, I was excited to read it as I'm a big fan of detective series novels. Unfortunately, I won't be reading any more Warshawski novels, in fact, I didn't finish this one. This book seemed to be a political essay thinly veiled as a third rate murder mystery. Regardless of your political views, I can't see how this book could be taken seriously. The story line was weak, the characters thin, and the writing was tedious."
1,Don't waste your time!,"This book is unbelieveably bad. I am still reading it and I can't believe it. I am on page 300 something and am determined to finish it but I don't know why. This has to be the WORST book I have ever read. I will NEVER read another one of Sara Paretsky's books again, EVER."
4,A real page turner,"I really enjoyed this book, and could not put it down. Constance O'Banyon is a great story teller, and this book was a real page turner.The characters where very likable and had a lot of depth, which keeps you hanging on for more.The story is about Lady Season Chatsworth who is kidnapped by ""The Raven"" a notorious pirate. The Raven wants to use Season as Ransom to free a fellow American patriot, but as time passes and deals fall through he does not seem to want to hand her back over to the British. Lot's of steamy love scenes."
2,Left something to be desired,"When I read this book, I found that the author left a little bit of something to be desired...a plot, perhaps?I read alot of romance novels, but this one I found to be a bit different from the kind that I usually enjoy. While the story was alright, it could have been vastly expanded on. This historical romance novel is based on a female that gets abducted by pirates and 'taken' by their captain. Taken over and over and over again. That's right folks, this book is basically all about sex. The masked captain of the pirate ship beds the helpless female many, many times over without much of anything for dialog, and she falls helplessly in love with him. How romantic.This book was written alright, but the plot left much to be desire...WITHOUT desire."
1,Bled after one wash...ruined,The dark red striped bled even on cold wash. Was ruined after one wash. I guess that is what you get for cheap!
2,Ink Spot on Collar,Product came a little worn down with ink on the collar which is very unattractive as one would imagine. It seems like a refurbished polo. I regret my purchase but don't feel like going through the return process.
1,Web site won't work,"Could not purchase even though I wanted the shirts badly. I would choose a color and a size and it would refer me to click the shopping cart and all that was there was something called the ""golden deal"" which would, when activated, refer me back to the same page with the same result. Amazon is a crazy place"
1,not what was pictured,"You pictured a new Dewalt drill bit, which works pretty well, but I was sent the discontinued version that works like crap (which is probably why it was discontinued) ... but what could I expect for 10 bucks? I would have given no stars if I could. I'm in construction, and it worked for perhaps 6 holes before I threw it away. It was USELESS!"
1,Extremely Disappointing.,"I gave up after reading a hundred pages or so. I'm a huge fan of James Dickey. I'd waited for so long for a second book from him and was so disappointed by this. The plot was vague and boring, and it didn't have that wonderful prose which Dickey used in Deliverance.The one positive I could say about this book is his idea of portraying the blind and sighted versions simultaneously. It didn't work in this. But the 'idea' is to be admired. He always seems to find some way to push the established boundaries of writing.(He pushes the boundaries again in the last of his novels, 'To The White Sea'. He has no dialogue at all for ninety odd percent of the book. Very successfully, too.)"
1,Nothing happened!,"This was probably the worst book I have ever read. I thought something would ""happen"", but other than philosophical meanderings of the war and the meaning of life, it was a complete waste of time and energy."
2,The Ox buries himself in '80s shlock-rock,"The whole appeal of John Entwistle's work was his darkly-humoured writing, thunderous bass, and distinctive yet very capable vocals. None of this are easily found in The Rock, recorded in the mid-80s. It is chock-full of musical cliches from the era, both musically and lyrically (stock guitar riffs and synthesizers, trite lyrics).It's really an Entwistle album in name only, as he wrote only 4 of the original 10 songs, defers lead vocals to Henry Small, and shows none of the musical complexity of his Who or '70s solo work. It does rock a bit, though, in a mindless way. And the review above is right, 'Love Doesn't Last' is the best song on the album.If you want a better sample of some of his later work, get the 'Left For Live' set."
3,"Very ""Starship""","I am a huge Who and Entwistle fan and it was delight that I finally got to listen to ""the Rock"" by the latter. This is, however, for the fan only. It is enjoyable listening to the familiar bass guitar, but the songs apparantly were recorded in, and sound very 80's - and not the best of, mind you. Also the singer employed for this band has the high vocal range of Mickey Thomas and thus the combo of the 1980's and a Thomas sound-a-like make this seem more like a cd from the band Starship than anything from Entwistle.If you are a huge Entwislte fan or love the Starship/80's sound than this is for you...if not stick with ""Thunderfingers: The Best of John E."" instead."
3,Nothing special here,First of all I must point out I am a fan of John Entwistle. This review is hard for me to write because I was not impressed at all with this release. It does indeed have the 1980's sound but it doesn't have John Entwistle's sound. If you listen to his previous work he always injects a bit of humour into his lyrics and the musical arrangements are more imaginative. This has none of that.This album sounds like any number of bands that were popular in the 1980's. It's not what a fan of John's would be expecting.If you are not familiar with John's solo work outside of The Who I recommend NOT starting with this one.
2,Its an O.K. album,"Beats are ridin but lyrics have no substance, lameFab Five:1 We Can Smoke2 To be Played3 My Life4 Got Everything5 This is How we Do"
4,Big Money Heavyweights,"Big Tymers back and they still doing it big. I didnt think this Cd was gonna be all that hot cause Cash Money aint what it used to be but this cds acctually pretty strate. Its all about Mannie motha f***ing Fresh!! Mannie has always made hot beats and things aint changed. And I like how his beats get alittle soulful on this album.Yea we all know mannie and baby arent great MCs but thats not what the Big Tymers all about. LOVE IT FOR WHAT IT IS OR MOVE ON.I really like track 2,3,4,6,7,12,16. Its all about LA!!!!!!!"
2,No Hood Rich,"First thing is..Cash Money is no more w/o the likes of BG, Juve, and Turk. Wayne is all they got goin and personally i'd like to see him leave even tho i kinda doubt that happening. Big Money Heavyweight is nowhere close to Hood Rich, i loved that album and i think that was the last good CMR album besides what Wayne puts out just keep this one on the shelves instead of in your collection, only about 3 or 4 good tracks on it. Dont waste your money"
2,2 Stars,"Mannie Fresh's production is the only reason I gave this album 2 Stars, he is one of the best producers from the south even though he does mostly party instrumentals. This album lacks in content and is lyrically terrible. NOT RECOMMENDED."
5,seems soufth,This CD is hot... If you like that southern rap this is a must have. lyricly it's great... beats are Xtream great CD to popin when rolling with ya homies. Great Job Tymers hope to see another soon!
2,it's ok,"I dig Manny's Beats on some Cuts. ""This is how we do it"" is my cut. They crack me up with their Lyrics. Glad to see Big Tymer's getting down with the King of R&B R.Kelly on the Jam ""Gangsta Girl"". The Album has some alright Beats but it's just hit & miss after that for me. I dig the Humor these Cats put out though. Crack Me Up. I'm Looking forward to R.Kelly & Birdy on the ""Best of Both Worlds 2"" that is coming soon."
3,it's a duplicate,"to me this cd sounds like the last one, but don't get me wrong i like the cashmoney click but this is like left over food that you already had a taste of it..."
4,Big Tymers - Big Money Heavyweight,1. Big Talk (Intro)2. This Is How We Do 5-3. Gangsta Girl 4-4. We Can Smoke 45. I'm A Dog 4-6. Against The Wall 5-7. I'll Take You There 4-8. Back Up 3+9.

4,BIG TYMIN,"Hot beats from mannie combined with the lyrics of baby and there you go, Big Money HeavyWeight. But, I expected more"
3,A Fun Album,"People don't understand...if you want lyrics go buy some NaS or Dead Prez. If you want the best beats out there, you either need this or one of tim's.magoo's albums. That being said, this album has plenty of hot beats and the lyrics are stupid and playful like always. A great chillin' or drivin' album!"
3,Its Straight,Mannies beats were soft on this album? Baby had his borin same lyrics again! The good thing was Mannie had his funny rhymes which is why people buy the Big Tymers albums! I cant wait for Mannies solo! But overall the album was aright.
3,Its Okay,It reminds me of Hood Rich their last cd. If you really want a good Cash Money CD go get that Let Em' Burn the new cd by the Hotboys. It was produced by Fresh.
2,Not as accurate as they claim,"Having used Ultra One Touch for several years, I am now looking for a different brand. I always use two or more strips for each drop of blood. Sometimes, they will be within two point but more often have a 10% or more difference. I have seen times that the reading were 30% different or more. When I feel they are not reasonable close, I use a third strip and throw out the odd number. I have asked a few friends that use the same test strip, they have found the same inconsistency. It doesn't seem to matter on the Lot No or Code, they all have the same problemDoes anyone have a suggestion for a better strip?"
1,Prilosec OTC,"I bought several boxes of this product and noticed that the sheets are not perforated, making it impossible to get the pills out. I have to use a box cutter to remove each pill because you cannot peel the back off."
3,Use 'em up quick...,"These are indeed genuine One Touch test strips at half the price. That's the good news. The only caveat is that they're closing in on their expiration dates. So if you only test one, two, three times a day, be sure not to order them in quantity. New One Touch test strips purchased at a retail outlet today don't expire until 2013, whereas the two boxes of 50 I got early this October expire in Jan. and Feb. 2012 respectively."
1,starting. the proocess with the bank now,Haven't received this as of yet I emailed and was told it would be sent back out. Still waiting.its over a month now I guess they ran out.
5,Great deal,Item arrived quickly and in great shape. I'd order from this vendor again. It saved me money off local stores!
5,Something I Needed,"I don't suffer from diabetes, but my doctor wants me to watch my blood sugar. I seem to be on the almost got it side, so I got a One Touch unit and have been keeping track as requested.I was almost out of test strips, so I went to my favorite place to buy, Amazon. When in doubt try Amazon. Well I found the type of strips I needed and ordered. Everything came as ordered.Very Good."
5,Good value,Proves to be good value and it was shipped promptly. I do recommend this shipper and this product for those who need it.
3,test strips,"the test strips where ok and had the expiration date was as indicated when purchsed.the boxes they came in were mashed. This wasn't due to shipping, they would not have sold on a retail shelf."
3,One Touch Glucose Test Strips,There is not really anything wrong with the strips I got. But I found them somewhat more difficult to insert to the meter device than the previous ones I purchased. Not sure why.... maybe slightly thicker or something.
4,one touch ultra test strips,"I am pleased with my purchase of the one touch ultra test strips, in the description it said the amount was 150 strips and i only received 100 test strips-so i was alittle dissapointed about thatOne touch Ultra 100 Count"
1,Opened Boxes-Product Tampering??,"I received my boxes of test strips in a very short time, but the boxes had been opened and there were dirty fingerprints all over the vials. Also one of the boxes of test strips was expired. Since these are used for the testing of blood sugar levels and are really an item for medical needs I would call this product tampering. I will be contacting the supplier as well as the Texas Attorney General. I will never buy from this supplier again and they have been on Amazon for some time now. I would rather pay a higher price somewhere else than get test strips that are more than likely no good. A waste of money"
1,Lifescan Test Strips,"I ordered these test strips about 10 days ago because of the superior price. Today (June 11, 2009) I received the test strips in two beaten up Lifescan containers. The expiration date for these 100 test strips is July 2009 -- in 19 days. These test strips are going back tomorrow and I will never buy from this supplier again."
2,cheaper price with reasons,"You have to be careful when purchasing this product, especially when you need to buy more than one package---the product is within 6 month to expiration date."
5,Incorrect expiration date,The Seller promoted the product with a minimum expiration date of 12 months. The expiration date on the product was less.
1,test strips,The test strip boxes looked like they had been opened and that price tags had been pulled off the face of the boxes. It sure makes one question the quality.
1,Not as advertised,"The product which we recieved was covered with Asian print on the box. When we called the manufacturer, they said it was illegal to even sell it in the United States. Don't sell items from this dealer anymore."
4,great ladder,"I've been using this extremely convenient ladder on the job site for over six years and have only had one problem in all that time - I pinched my finger in one of the articulating joints. Once you figure out how to adjust the ladder quickly, it's a great ladder. I use it often in the scaffolding position and it is easy to pack and haul.I'd recommend it to anybody. In fact I'm looking at getting another for my brother and my local distributor doesn't carry them any more - they now carry a cheaper model made by another company."
2,A Freebie for me !,"My Daughter, a professor at USC, bought this ladder and found it bulky and unmanageable. Even with her Mother's help, they couldn't handle it and gave it to me.I am a Mechanical Engineer and weigh 230 #. I am able to use it occasionally for the very few jobs that no other ladder seems better for. Definitely not for most women!Robert Smith"
4,"A little lackluster, but overall good","In this volume we again see the gang going to a high school to investigate a mysterious supernatural crime, but you can't help but wonder how so many mysterious things happen without it becoming a more everyday thing for the general public. A school has a mysterious curse on a desk that causes anyone who sits at it to be harmed or die. Of course Naru & all get called in to investigate, and inevitably their lives are put in danger.Would I recommend this? For the most part, yes. I actually liked this, despite it's moments of tedium. It's still entertaining. Maybe it's not as consistently good, but it's still worth purchasing."
5,Great Calculus Textbook,"I can't speak for newer editions, but I can say with confidence that this is the best calculus textbook that one could buy. It has certain flaws and yet its flaws are far fewer than Stewart's series and it is more user-friendly. The illustrations of graphs and word problems make it very helpful to any student."
3,"A mix of surprise, creativity and dissapointment...","Although published in '91 the quilts and techniques in this book are reminiscent of the '70s. Ms. Olsen does a great job of researching Native American designs. Her interpretation and execution of the quilts, however, is a little dissapointing. Her quilts are very simplistic and, in the case of her CHEMEHUEVI CRIB QUILT, entirely misses the design elements. Most of the quilts are pictured draped instead of full view. These quilts could easily be done with the strip piecing technique but Ms. Olsen gives directions for individual patchwork pieces instead. The book does however, have wonderful patterns which are easily adapted to modern techniques and fabrics. Overall, I enjoy the book and look forward to using her authentic designs."
2,flimsy,There is way to much sway in the pole. The sections do not join together tight enough to eliminte this problem- to much plastic needs metal connections for a more solid feel.
5,True singer/songwriter talent shines,"Many talented singer/songwriters tend to lose some of their ""umph"" when they go solo (see Neil Finn). Glen seems to do the opposite. Sure, the CD doesn't rock like some of Toad's stuff did, but the song writing and pop melodies are wonderful. Best cuts include ""Duck and Cover"" and the fun love song ""Easier."" It's the first album I've picked up this year that I'm able to listen all the way through multiple times without skipping songs. I caught Glen live at SXSW, also ... looking forward to a national tour."
5,Amazing!,"You know who lead Toad. This is a near perfect album.When I re-discovered it, it was the perfect moment for me and the lyrics and emotion are profound. Thanks Glen!"
5,Back for more,"Glen Phillips is probably the best known unknown artist that you've never heard of. (Hence the ""voice of Toad The Wet Sprocket"" note on the cover label.)Something this good shouldn't remain a secret. This album is loaded with wry, delicate lyrics layered over rich, intricate melodies and harmonies. This is a polished, earnest, and mature album. Being familiar with many of the songs from years of Glen's solo performances, it's a treat to rediscover old favorites updated and fleshed out with a backing band, though it may be a bit surprising at first to those used to hearing the straightforward guitar and vocal renditions.Another excellent release from an amazing artist.""True"", ""Duck and Cover"", and ""Gather"" are standouts on this collection"
5,finally! smart AND catchy music,"wow! this cd is great from start to finish. this is a wonderful effort from glen phillips. the melodies are strong and memorable, the lyrics are intelligent, poetic, and well-crafted, and the production is completely and expertly fleshed out by john fields. this disc runs the gamut from softly sweet ballads to straight rock and roll to roll-down-your-windows-and-blast-the-neighborhood goodness.you'll find yourself humming any one of these songs on any given day, they're that good. fantastic!!!"
