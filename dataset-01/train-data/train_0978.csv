3,For ages 8 to 13,"this was a great story however the writing was very "" Jr High"". it reads like it was written by or for little kids. Like I said, a great story but there were parts that were very hard to read without laughing out load."
2,I was able to finish it,"Very retro space opera. Lots of action, juvenile writing, poor editing. Pure ""good vs. evil."" Laughable science. That said, it was an engaging story. Author needs to cut his price until the quality improves."
2,"So close, so far!","I meet The Picts in Glasgow in 1997, playing excelent live irish & scottish folks in pubs. When I began to listen to this CD very was deluded, but with crossing the songs I was losing my breath. It's incredible that excellent musicians like these band as they record songs like ""Elephant Jam"" and ""Baby Rachel Grooves"". This weakened its work. Irish folk finished there and turned in a badly work the CD. I think don't recommend to buy something that only 60 % is what they must and know to do well.It's because also is probable that finish disappointed like me."
3,Mendelssohn's Reformation,"Parts that I heard before as slow and delicate were rushed. Parts that normally give me goose bumps left me dissapointed. I have high regards for any conductor and any orchestra, as they give us so much beauty while taking so very little from us. But, with due respect, I will continue looking for a better Mendelssohn's Reformation."
2,"Not a great Mendelssohn 5 ""Reformation""","NOTE: This review doesn't apply to the Franck D minor that is on the same disc. My main gripes with this performance of the Mendelssohn are that:1) The brass section has an intonation problem. I thought it was especially noticeable at the unison part in the very beginning of the first movement. They aren't horribly out of tune, but enough that it really bothers me.2) The tempo of the third movement is too fast.3) The whole performance, especially that of the restatement of the hymn at the very end of the fourth movement, is too sterile and clinical.Skip this recording and look for the one by Charles Munch and the Boston Symphony. The CD cover has a picture of a butterfly on it. The Munch performance is quite a bit more emotional, and although there seems to be a change to the trumpet part at the end (it ends on the tonic in the Munch instead of the median like in the printed score) it is quite good. I also feel the Munch is better than the Paray."
5,Bedtime Magic!!,"Bedtime MAGIC. I mean it...it's real, honest, folksy, and heart-MELTing good. Emjoyable listen for parents and kids alike. Their sound is folksy and the lyrics and melodies are simply addictive. I bought it, without hesitation, for 2 of my friends for Christmas as soon as I heard it!"
5,One Word.. Amazing!,"My boss was getting sick of my white plugs, and he told me to either let them close up, or I would be fired. So I purchased these and told him that they closed up. He didn't even notice them! These plugs are amazing!"
2,Skip this one and move on to the rest,"This has got to be the worst of all the sick and twisted tapes. The quality isn't as good, the cartoons are not as good and it doesn't cost any less. Save your money and buy one of the later ones. Of course, if you have em all and just need this one to complete your collection, don't expect the laughs you got from the latter ones."
3,Filler,"A little too patriarchal for me. Anyway Rigoletto is much the better opera. The father figure is much more simpatico because of his physical handicap, and humiliating career choice.I just got this opera because a) I needed to fill out the order of the useless Bodum glass beaker replacement part I got with it, so I could get the free shipping,and b) I liked the sound of the name Simon Bocanegra"
2,A very boring opera,"The music in this opera will make you fall asleep fast.This opera is as overrated as La fanciulla del West and Die Frau ohne Schatten. Except for the beginning of the opera (which lasts about 30 seconds) with its beautiful notes, and Amelia's aria in Act 1, most of the rest of the music is just dull, dull, dull.For those of you who enjoy tuneless, boring music like Simon Boccanegra, fine. However, don't go around amazon.com proclaiming such operas to be ""masterpieces"". That's an insult to those of us who like more popular, more tuneful fare like Puccini and mid-period Verdi, as well as Ada (these operas have way more in the way of melodious, MEMORABLE music). The problem with Simon Boccanegra is that its music goes in one ear and out the other."
5,Cappuccilli not Gobbi: Thats brillianti!,"Abbado's Simon Boccanegra is the finest Recording I have herd, yet. For one thing thist one of Verdi's best works, and we also got singers who follow the ruels of bel-canto. Abbado and Cappuccilli are men who know how to perform a Verdi opera, They are specilsti in there art. The rest of cast stands up pretty good and the sound is fine."
1,Barely Usable,"I purchased this tool months in advance of my project and it didn't survive one repair job. It's advertised for both positioning the cam and holding it while loosening. My cam gear bolts were factory tightened and still this short handle Lisle tool required a pipe on its end to offset force from my 24"" breaker bar. The tool began to bend while loosening the first bolt, and broke in half on the second bolt. Lisle Customer Service Rep told me that the tool ""was altered for use"" by putting a pipe on it and they do not make a longer tool..... no warranty."
4,A great book for Chow Chow owners and enthusiasts!,"This little handbook is a good quick reference for dog lovers. There are a number of pictures and plenty of recommendations for Chow pet supplies. Some of the topics include breeding, showing, Chow history and puppy care."
5,ALZHEIMERS. It's ours too.,"My husband, a retired physician in internal medicine recently received the Alzheimers diagnosis. His IQ is still so high that it will be some time before it drops to 100. Meanwhile he takes his sandwich off his plate and walks around the kichen looking for the very plate he left behind. The contrast of his ability to make brilliant analysis of current world affairs and the confused searches for things he can't find is unbelievable. Yet it cannot be denied. Larry's book gave us a way to identify. It shed light and spilled grace onto those of us who, one way or another, walk the Alzheimers road. My husband has just sent copies of this book to his children so they might know what he feels inside. Thank you Larry and Mazeltov!"
5,AN INSPIRATION,"I have heard it said that ""He has achieved succes who has lived well, laughed often and loved much"". Larry Rose, the author of ""Show me the way to go home"" has achieved success. Rose will leave this world a better place than he found it by giving us this book. It is a book that cannot be put down until you have read the last page then leaves us wanting to learn more. Rose has given us the best he has to give and has never lacked the appreciation of others that have helped him along his journey through Alzheimer's disease. His life should be an inspiration to all of us. Through his book, Rose has gained the respect of intelligent people and the love of all who have been fortunate to read it. Rose is fighting this disease with the grace of a true hero. His story in an inspiration: his memory will be a benediction. I am looking forward to reading his next book. Kathy Smith RN"
2,"Good game, bad company","Thunder 2004 has a very good game engine, yet it has some serious flaws. Which is why EA won't support it, and is the reason why I will not support EA.The premise is very good, although behind the times for the ""year"" it names. The tracks are unbelievably accurate, watch through the Nascar ""in-car"" on TV, they did such an outstanding job getting the track layout correct.But... the flaws start with computer programmers deciding which car adjustment does what. Usually, they're opposite from reality. Cautions are so bad that there needs to be a reset button, and the worst is the cold shoulder from EA for any type of support.Buy at your own risk."
1,"No, really. It sucks.","I'm not running a slow computer and it still doesn't compare to NASCAR Racing 2003 Season from Vivendi/Sierra/Papyrus. The graphics are comparable to the Atari racing games I used to play, and not even up to the Indy Car Racing from some years back (also from Papyrus). In short, the graphics are horrid, the vehicle response is terrible. I ran the demo and found the car extremely hard to control. And the demo is Talladega - my track!One plus is that the rear view mirror is much clearer than in the Papyrus game.I'm going back to NASCAR Racing 2003 Season."
2,stupid,"It is too unrealistic. You feel like quiting on the first lap it is so boring the cars are slow and have bad handling. the graphics are choppy and pausey. This game is for fools. If you want a good racing game expeirience get NFS4 or NR2003 Season instead of this game. Their is only 1 thing good about it. it is cool to wreck that slow, poorly designed car."
2,graphic,just play the demoNASCAR racing series 2003 has better graphics(B)This game a Dnot all that better to nascar thunder 2003 graphics
3,Not the best Nascar Game,"There are some really great Nascar games out there, however this is not one of them.It's ok, but not what I expected."
4,you need patience with this game,"Ok, I'm not going to talk about computer specs or anything, but im sure everyone's computer is supreme compare to mine, however I can still play the game decently. I'm not a car junkie so I NEVER touched the car settings, I will in the future when I have the time to play with it. This game takes time to develop really. I enjoyed the furious battle for position and the AI is really competitive. The car handles just right for me. I dont know why the bad reviews from others. I'm not even a NASCAR fan but I love the competitive-ness. I recommend this game to whoever loves a good competition. Its also a great way to learn about cars as you fine tune your beast into a champion."
3,Sweet story,"A sweet story with a predictable plot. What better to read during the holiday period when our mind turns to good things. Although the plot was predictable and the reader knows what was going to happen, it was still enjoyable."
3,It was alright,It was pretty ridiculous at times. It wasn't horrible but it wasnt great either. At times it holly was downright obnoxious.
3,It wasn't the usual good characters.,"The woman was insipid. No one is that naive. Perhaps people read romances for all the sex descriptions, but I am not one of them."
4,Good book,I love a book that happends during the holidays. The author entertains you with this light hearted story. I would recommend this book.
5,"Rare, but worth trying to get.",This album is amazing and is something I would rate one of the top 5 electronica albums of all time. There's something about the music that immerses you in its rapture. It's quite an experience to listen to Bola Soup.
3,Spirit of that age,"This album is a fairly mainstream take on Ambient/Atmospheric electronica and includes a number of quite listenable tracks. After ~6 listenings I think this is a nice but not particularly compelling CD. OK compositions and OK production. The reason I bought this album (and am writing this review) is that a number of internet forums cite it as being roughly comparable to stuff by Boards of Canada, who were working around the same time (1998). As a large BoC fan (@ 6 foot and 210lbs) I would like to say that in my opinion this is not at all like BoC. It has more in common with something like Eno's Music for Airports (which I like a lot). IMO BoC focus on a killer melody hook and then add a bunch-of-stuff-from-God-knows-where; this is not the case for Bola Soup."
4,Energetic performances of Strauss family staples,"The liner notes emphasize that, indeed, the music of one's homeland does not necessarily flow in one's veins. While Austrian by birth, it took von Karajan some time to develop a feel for the Strauss family idiom; indeed, the notes say that his earlier attempts (in the late 1940's) produced recordings that were panned as overly-serious and stiff.Never having heard any of those older discs, I can't give a before and after assessment of von Karajan's interpretations. This recording, nonetheless, is quite good. There's dash and volume where appropriate, as well as a melancholy undercurrent where that belongs as well. So, you have a conductor who's finally hit his stride with this type of music, and playing a few lesser-heard pieces as well. Go for it, Strauss fans."
4,Great album.,"After first bringing this album back to the US back in 1992, I have had numerous requests for copies from friends. I have dutifully brought back copies on every trip to Germany or the Czech Republic. The selection of singles exceeds in quality those on any of the US-release Alphaville greatest hits albums. If you only buy one Alphaville album, this is the one to have!"
4,Harvest your favourites!,"Alphaville is one of greatest syth-pop bands in the 80s! Absolutely, Alphaville seems to be as good as Depeche Mode and Duran Duran. This collection has an important place in Alphaville's career because after this their music changed darker and sophististic. You can find classic songs Forever Young, Jerusalem and Big in Japan for this album. Some important songs are unfortunately missing for exemple Fallen Angel. My favourite tracks are a beautiful and major Jerusalem, a terrific Dance With Me, a mournful and fine quitar tasted Romeos and awesome and evergreen Forever Young. There are some songs that Alphaville would have droppep out. Booring Summer Rain and too long For A Million are these songs. All in all, If you like syth-pop, this is a great buy for you."
3,"Alphaville - ""First Harvest""","This CD is a compilation. The tracks are well chosen and serves as a good reference on the band. The best songs on the CD are ""Big In Japan"", ""Sounds Like a Melody"", ""Dance With Me"" and ""Forever Young"". It is a dance pop style. This CD is enough of this band to me that I am not a fan."
2,It looks good!,This feeder looks good but I had to repair it right out of the box. The bottom is attached to the 4 corner posts with tiny screws. The screws were inserted at an angle and had split 2 of the 4 corners. It was cheap so I got out the gorilla glue and fixed it myself. Three months later it seems to be ok.
2,Career threatening analysis,"Thomson makes bizare mistakes that leave you wondering whether he saw the same films. It might have helped if he had paid attention in physics class; he might of understood how the alien was destroyed by water in the third Alien film. His analysis of each film is marred by obvious contradictory elements. Most of his criticisms are not original and could have been overheard in coffee shops in the first week of release. And his rewrite of Alien 4, with Bishop as stud in a sexual fantasy ... ??? That truely boggles the mind. The real problems of the later film lay in scripting and production influences, which is hardly rocket science. The book is not without value, but it wouldn't be particularly helpfull in understanding the success of the first two films and the failure of the second two. In fact, the same bogus intellectualization that took down the later films seems to also ruin Thomson's book."
5,Howard Zinn - a true American,"Very interesting book, the variety of people is wonderful and well thought out. It takes someone special to look at their own country and not shy away from painful parts of our history. The only way to move forward is to learn from the real past not the rosy schoolbook history that been sanitized."
4,~ basic freedom and dignity ~,The Frederick Douglass speech read by James Earl Jones alone is worth the purchase. The People Speak is a great collection of speeches and words (read by others) of the men and woman throughout our history who fought for basic freedom and dignity. An inspired record of community and the power of remembering our past.
2,Pleasant but nothing more...,"I know that many reviewers find this to be one of the greatest piano discs ever recorded, so I hope that readers will be open to a contrary and somewhat heretical point of view.I never heard these pieces until I bought this CD. They are basically nice salon pieces: charming, melodic, lightweight. I notice that several reviewers have pointed out that Gilels does not play up the sentimentality in these pieces. Perhaps that's what I find lacking in these performances. I guess I am saying that I would prefer to hear frankly sentimental compositions such as these played with a great deal more sentiment.Please be aware of the very real possibility that you will find this music boring. The music has grown on me over a period of several months of frequent listening, but I prefer to listen to a few pieces at a time and then put the disc away for a while. It also makes very pleasant background music! (More heresy!!)Caveat emptor."
2,dishlady,"I was disappointed at the number of recipes in the book for the price. I don't think it was worth it. Very thin, one recipe to a page, not a wealth of information on the disease itself either. I would not buy the others in the series."
3,I wouldn't call this a book...,"...it's more like a pamphlet. I guess for $16 I expected too much, but this book looked like it was put together by a fourth grade class. Big font, small pages, thin book. As for the recipes, they seemed very basic, which I imagine is the point. But if the goal was to let gout sufferers know that their days of eating good food is over, well...mission accomplished.I returned the book immediately, and Amazon was great with that process."
5,stepmother book of receipies,my step mother just found out she had gout and wanted to know to cook with or give her ideas on what to cook very simple receipies loved it
4,ok,This book gave good insights into dealing with my gout. I have used some of the recipes and like them.
2,Save your money,"I was very disappointed with this cookbook. It's thin and sparse, almost pamphlet-like for the money and not professionally written.Gout sufferers have a hard time finding information on improving their lifestyle and this book doesn't help much...there are better books out there if you search."
4,A very good read.,"Boyle does a wonderful job with setting, providing a real picture of the cities and towns of Maine yet the solitude, which exists immediately outside them, and the cold of winter. You also feel Jack's reluctance to become involved with Rocky yet his inability to walk away. There is a strong element of pathos to this story, but it's still suspenseful and a page-turner."
5,"Consuelo Luz ""DEZEO"" exciting new genre","Just when you thought you've heard every genre of music - WHOA! This CD, DEZEO is big, deep, fluid, fast, slow. spanish/hebrew/klezmer/newage/folk. mystical? this chic's music is thick as a brick. the web samples don't do it justice. WOW! I'm still dancing and the music stopped 20 minutes ago. Mary Cliff featured this CD on WETA public radio show Traditions. Way to go Mary! Consuelo - you go girl!"
3,an ok read but not a keeper for me,"My Lord Pirate and this sequel ""night Shadow"" are about brothers Talon and Marcus Drake. Englishmen turned to piracy to avenge the murder of their families. Of course they fight it but eventually fall in love with the ""enemy"". The characters are excellent, however the content is pretty basic stuff without any major surprises. It's your call."
3,Prang Yellow Chalk (12 count),"This chalk writes smooth and dark on my black board. The chalk also erases well. The only problemis, instead of 12 sticks I received 4 sticks and a box full of bits and pieces. Young kids may notmind the small bits of chalk but I prefer to start with a stick that will work with my chalk holder."
3,Kleiber was not at his best in Schubert,"I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer below who finds these interpretations too driven. There's something to be said for Kleiber's intensity, and of course the Vienna Philharmonic's playing is gorgeous. But I think that the intensity and ""driven"" quality of Kleiber's approach work better in his recordings of the Beethoven 5th and 7th and the Brahms 4th than they do here; the ""Unfinished"" calls for intensity, to be sure, but it must be matched by lyricism. I would suggest that listeners looking for a more balanced approach to this work look to Karl Böhm's recording with the Berlin Philharmonic, available in an inexpensive boxed set of all the Schubert symphonies or with the 9th on a super-budget Eloquence CD; I find it an exceptionally natural approach, lyrical and warm yet never lacking dramatic tension."
2,Not enough Biblical truth,"I found this to be a shallow movie, poor acting and not enough Biblical truth. The teenagers were not appropriately dressed. I don't like the style of tank tops and bra straps showing. Too tight clothing and materialistic. I wouldn't waste your money."
4,A good reference for little organisms,"The book is big and heavy and is filled with useful information for the world of microorganisms. All microbiology majors must have this book in their libraries. This book helps you identify, compare, and understand microorganisms better. Every organism is descibed in detail: gram-stain reactions, fermentation reaction, morphology, etc."
4,Klemperer?,"Several reviewers claim greatness for the Klemperer version of this opera, particularly for Popp's Queen of the Night. I was selling records when that version was released on LP, and except for sales to some Klemperer diehards, we couldn't give the set away. Personally, I didn't think it was a disaster (though I admit to chuckling at the comments about the performance needing 12 LPs). I did agree with the criticism of Popp, however, finding her singing technically good for the most part, but dull. She didn't/doesn't sound angry/frustrated/poisonous etc., just bland (and I usually like Popp a lot). I'm more than happy with the Bohm version, even given it's age."
3,I've heard better,The mismatched voices were extremely distracting. Peters as the Queen didn't work well... at all. I bought this cd and I *hardly* ever want to listen to it.
4,why the complaints????,"don't be swayed by other, bitter reviews of this recording -- there is some serious hating going down in them. this is a beautiful production featuring one of the best conductors and some of the finest operatic voices of the 20th century. roberta peters' characterization of the queen of the night is entrancing, noble, dramatic, and -- even more importantly -- one of the few that actually dimensionalizes the queen's rage, hurt, frustrations, and sorrow!!!! there's definitely a reason (more than just the reliability of her high Fs -- as callas said, the Fs alone are not enough) why peters gave more than a bazillion performances of this role at the metropolitan... just like there's a reason that the met is currently saluting evelyn lear (pamina).... so maybe all the haters just need to get off their butts and go sing 'flute' themselves, if they really think there is so much lacking in this version."
1,A Waste Of Money,"This book, or as I prefer to call it, ""pamphlet"", has a total of 50 pages, but if you remove the blank pages, contents, glossary etc. there is only 27 pages. There are a lot of pictures of hoofs, telling you the name of each part. I learned nothing from this book other than a lesson to look at a book in person before I spend... on a ""pamphlet""."
3,A little puzzling,"Having read ""The Cat's Table"" and absolutely loving it, I went on to read In the Skin of a Lion. Having been brought up in Toronto and within a couple of blocks of the Waterworks, I was interested to read the background on it's development, along with other landmarks in Toronto. It was a compelling read, although a little disjointed at times. Seemed to jump around quite a bit. Overall, I quite enjoyed it, but was left going, ""Hmmmmmmmmmm."""
4,Very lyrical and non-linear,"If I never read this story again I'll remember the images more the plot. And then the characters. Patrick and Nick Temelcoff are two characters that live inside thier heads, and reading their dreams and impressions makes me feel like they've crawled inside my head.One the scenes that Patrick watches, the Finnish ice skaters at night on the frozen riverbed, with flaming cattails to light them, is scene I've never imagined, and the image haunts me."
5,Beautiful,"A beautiful book. A 200 page poem that will keep you up at night, hungry for more. Mr. Ondaatje is one of the greatest poets currently working and his ability to craft poetry weaved around narrative is nothing short of stunning. The rebellious nature of the predecessor to ""The English Patient"" sets it in stark contrast to the defeatist, post-war drama of its more critically acclaimed sibling. The characters are deep, the drama rich, and the events molded from history; if not necessarily fact. If you have enjoyed any of Ondaatje's writing, you will love ""In the Skin of a Lion"" - and if you are one of the fortunate ones able to enjoy Ondaatje for the first time, I envy you..."
3,Strange & unsatisfying,"The leading character never seems to think. He just follows his impulses without ever seeming to question whether the impulses are moral or immoral, sane or crazy. The descriptions of settings are interesting and memorable."
2,Not to my taste at all,"This is supposed to be a classic, highly recommened to me by a literate friend. I agree that it is poetic, and has a gossimer feel to it. But, I found it a tedious read. It is in that somewhat detatched present tense that I do not relate well to. The story line is difficult to follow, the character hard to understand. I will not read any more of Ondaatje, I imagine."
1,In the skin of the lion,"We chose this book for our bookclub based on ""The English Patient"". It was reviewed as a prequel. The character of Caravaggio is in it, but the chapter in which he appears seems to be more of an afterthought and totally superfluous to the rest of the story. In a sentence, this book can be summed up as: The rich get richer and the poor blow them up. We actually chucked this as our discussion book after 2 of us read it, and picked another!If you want to learn to build a bridge, this is the book for you. If not, then SKIP this dog of a story."
5,"Lyrical and enthralling, read it before The English Patient.","This book fiendishly sucks you in and doesn't let you go. It is full of lyrical prose that your unconscious mind sits back and admires while your conscious mind is totally enthralled by the story. The characters are complex, the situations are fantastic but believable (for the most part, and you want to believe the unbelievable ones) - I can still vividly picture some of the scenes, and it's been more than two years since I read it! This is definitely a book to fall in love with. Read this Michael Ondjaatje book first, it sets up the situations and characters that are later found in The English Patient and introduces you to his magic"
2,"Not bad, but elitist","I feel Ondaatje's book is an interesting way to give a history lesson, especially to us (you know, we brazenly pompous Americans living in a morally bereft culture who really don't know anything about our own history - the stories of our ancestors and their exploitation at the hands of our ruthless, capitalist leaders, not just the Founding Fathers), which is odd considering he wants our $. Gee, Mr. O, can I sit at your knee while you dispense your wisdom?Give me a break.I was actually going along with this story, but I got sick of O's characters doing totally incongruous and unbelievable things (wait to you get to the end). You can't sacrifice this much realism for the sake of getting your point across - and I know the whole point is O saying ""look - see how people don't do things they're expected to?"" But, again, give me a break - too heavy in political overtones that make me feel that O should stick to poetry."
1,"I thought I'd give him another try, but I shouldn't have","I think this is a pretty terribly written and overrated book. I didn't like English Patient to begin with, but I thought I had read it when I was too young, so I gave In the Skin of a Lion a try. What bothered me most was the dialogue--it felt so contrived. And I couldn't care about the characters. In fact, the whole novel seemed vaporous--that is, superficially lovely but lacking any substance."
1,this was the,"This was the worst book i have ever read. I had to do it for a english course and write a paper on it. the book was tedious, pointless and extremley unintresting."
1,"This was a story, right?","Before I started writing this, I read the reviews from other readers. I thought there might be some other people who felt the same way about this book as I did. Well, everyone else loved it so I guess I'm on my own.Of all the books I've read (and they aren't Dick and Jane books), this one was the hardest to follow. The story jumped all over the place. I always had to go back and try to find things, which doesn't make reading too enjoyable. Actually, I found it annoying but I had to finish it because I started it....and I paid $15.00 for it.This book did nothing for me...other than put me to sleep on the train coming home from work. All of those other people liked it, though, so there must be something to it (those chapters must be missing from my copy).If you like getting lost in a book (literally), then maybe this one is for you. It definitely wasn't for me"
1,disappointing,"After the English Patient, which I thought was a beautifully written and constructed book, I found this to be a complete bore. I was uninvolved, uninterested and unaffected. After the plane trip for which I bought the book was over, I never returned to finish it."
2,Not the greatest book,"I am a high school student, and I am reading this book for an English course. I had a list of books to choose from, and for some reason I chose this one. I regret it because I find this book extremely boring. This plot has no point at all. It is difficult to read, since not much is happening. I am required to compare this book with the movie Gladiator, and find similar themes between the two. I have the feeling I'm going to have a very hard time doing that.As a fellow Canadian, I am not disapproving of the Canadian history behind this book, but it doesn't make much sense to me. Maybe I will have to read it a couple more times. This is the first novel I have read by Michael Ondaatje, and I don't think I will be reading any of his works again."
1,Poor,"I grew infuriated (and bored) with this novel when I discovered that, about halfway through, that it had no idea where it was going. The small elements of the book that deliver actual story are some of the most engaging efforts at fiction I have come across in years. It is genuine, deeply interesting, and swolen with careful, careful writing.Unfortunately, ""In the Skin of the Lion"" strays far too often into a kind of lazy poetry-prose, a landscape where every notion is ephemeral and fleeting. In some parts, this book is not so much a novel but a dull soliloquy on the helplessness, bravery and romance of the people we are supposed to be interested in reading about."
5,a great novel for great readers,"it seems as though the reviews of this book from other people are either excellent ot bottem of the barrel. I think this novel was written exceptionally. It is true, that the novel jumps here and there, but it is written for great readers who take note of all the fine details, and imagery that ondaatje has lain out so carefully."
5,The teen years are some of the more stressful of people's lives,"The teen years are some of the more stressful of people's lives - high school, hormones ranging, preparing for the future. Now in a fully revised and informatively updated new edition, ""Fighting Invisible Tigers: Stress Management for Teens"" is a guide book for teenagers who need to reduce the stress in their hectic lives. ""Fighting Invisible Tigers"" outlines ten techniques that will assist teens in their desire to control their stress, such as breathing and relaxation exercises, time management, dealing with hostile peers/family/friends, and embracing an optimistic outlook. A top pick for community library parenting collections.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
1,verrrrry outdated edition,"This book was the original version---over 20 years old and was so dated that I sent it back to the seller about 2 weeks ago and have yet to hear from them. If there had been any information about the date of publication available when I ordered it, I never would have prodeeded with the order. I am very disappointed and now I must follow up with the seller again!!!"
3,Don't Judge a Book by Its Photographer,"Anyone familiar with the current art scene would jump to buy this and understandbly so with the names involved, unfortunately, it's a disappointment. I hate to slam it because I like Sutherland's work, but I was just hoping for so much more out of the documentary. Most of the interviews are boring (mainly because they last too long), there aren't very many messangers shown, there's nothing on the film about the CMWC, which could've at least provided him with more interviews, and there's only one messanger whose life is shown beyond the surface."
3,Not as great as i thought it'd be,"As a former messenger and current bicycle enthusiast, i usually enjoy any documentary or movie on being a bike messenger. I just exspected more from this one. Its kinda depressing at times (tho, being a messenger can be depressing at times so i understand). The packaging and book are nice tho."
3,to much emphasis on the dispatch life and not the real messenger life,Pedal was good in the sense of the idea. I think that it was advertised as a messenger movie. I have a boyfriend who was a messenger and the flaw of this movie comes by making them all look like low level lifers to the streets not the real people who ride the job.
4,OK,"A little hard to use with my 7yr old grandson. He loved the experiment, just a little over his head is following the directions."
2,Not at all what I was expecting,"I was expecting something a little more ""high tech"" than what is offered in this product. The materials are VERY fragile so be very careful. This is not something for the younger kids to try on their own and it is even difficult for an adult to put together, in my experience."
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,These shoes are so wonderful!! Gorgeous buttery soft genuine leather. Very comfotable! These shoes are well worth the money!!!
3,The old standard...,I read this book in college 25 years ago. Now we know that it doesn't work. But Samuelson ought to be read in self defense so that one knows what the statists in government believe their economic role to be. It's like you ought to read Dr. Spock to learn how NOT to bring up children if you want them to be happy and responsible adults.
4,I THOUGHT THAT THIS BOOK WAS VERY NEAT. I F YOU HAVE AN,IDEA OF A CERTAIN WAY YOU WANT A LOK AND NOT SURE AT GWETTING IT LOOK AT THE BOOK FOR REFRENCE. I AM SO INTO MAKE-UP AND I LOVE THIS BOOK.
2,An overrated 'great recording',"This is one of those sacred cows of the gramophone, which on reissue proves to be something of a disappointment. I'm afraid that while it was probably competitive when it first appeared, it has simply been surpassed in terms of both performance and recording.The playing is fine, and the mono recording OK-ish for the mid-fifties, but Sanderling's interpretation (not to mention the cuts) make this hardly recommendable....."
2,Not the best,This CD originally appeared as part of the 5 disc COLLECTION and as such doesn't stand up as a reording in it's own right. Much of the material is from John's latter works so will only be of interest if you havn't got the original albums. Unfortunately the excellent the title track and FALLING LEAVES fail to lift this hotch potch above the mediocre. Only recommended if you are determined to own any collection of John's that you can get your hands on.
2,Not good for volvo,"I ordered this thinking it would help changing a volvo DOHC 5cyl, it doesn't fit.Too bad they don't list the engines it will work on."
4,Good time saver,I normally used a pin as recommended in the service manual. This tool does the job nicely specially if you don't have 2 pins of the required size. I'm just a sticker for precision on this type of job and this tool was useful.
3,It will do in a pinch.,"The pins aren't quite long enough to make work on any overhead cam engine. I was disappointed, I really wanted it to work."
1,Does not work!,"Seller needs to list engines it will work on, waste of time and money! Will not work with a 2.4 dohc, studs are to short and don't lineup!"
4,helpful tool,"A lot of online suggestions exist for keeping the cams in position, but this worked perfectly and caused me no worries about accidentally losing track of the OVHD cam clocking"
3,No good for Subaru dual overhead cam,Looks like a useful tool but it doesn't work on a Subaru 4 cylinder turbo engine. The problem is that this tool needs the cam sprocket notches to come to the edge of the sprocket. On the Subaru only one of the sprockets has this.
3,"It was a good book, I guess","I am a big fan of Christopher Pike, afterall I have read a lot of his books (enough to predict almost everything that is going to happen), but I have to say this was not one of his better books. I have to say though the climax of this book was great! It was so suspeseful and sad at the same time. Haven't seen such a great climax from Christopher Pike since Final Friends: The Graduation. This book was overall good except for the fact that Peter can finally walk and Shari dies! The other thing I found extremely boring was the ""Starlight Crystal."" Like said before I almost just skipped this part. I mean this didn't have any point at all in this book. Pike did a great Job with the characters in this series though! I guess you could say not his best work, but a good book to read."
4,Last Story- very different from where first story began,"I enjoyed this book very much. I always love reading more about characters that I've already come to know, however the trilogy ends in a much different place than you would expect it to. I personally am a big fan of Christopher Pike's science fiction novels so when REMEMBER ME 3 entered into this realm I didn't mind. If you loved the mystery of the first novel, but do not like Pike's sci-fi, you will most likely be dissapointed by the end of this series and I would recommend that you not read the two sequals. Of course it is still a wonderful mystery and you will always love all the characters set up for you by the first two novels. The only thing I think I would change, which I feel was done very nicely in the final Last Vampire book, would be to bring back or make mention of more of the people from the first book, Shari's original life."
4,AN OK CONCLUSTION,"I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN OK CONCLUSION ALTHOUGH MY FAVORITE WAS DEFINETLY THE ORIGINAL! THIS WAS KIND OF CONFUSING, HE KEPT BRINGING IN ALL THESE OTHER CHARACTERS THAT I FELT WAS NOT NEEDED. HE SHOULD HAVE JUST STUCK WITH ALL THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS."
3,Doesn't Meet Potential,"Spring showers might bring may flowers, but before anything can sprout, a tractor must pass along the furrows. Though I'm not a farmer, I have always enjoyed the hearty beauty of a tractor in an open field. ""The Illustrated Directory of Tractors"" by Peter Henshaw feeds my interest.This book is loaded with two things: pictures of tractors and a few paragraphs about each one.Whether you like the Emerson-Brantingham 12-20 of 1918, or are fascinated by the entire line of modern John Deeres, you'll love this overview.The downside is the production. Photos don't appear to be color-corrected, the spine is stiff, and the dimensions of the book are not practical. Despite having 280 stunning tractor photos from across the world, much of each image is lost in the inner margin of two-page spreads.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"
4,Something fun for my wife,"In a word - BIG! My wife wanted some fun earrings to wear to work - she manages the cheese section of an upscale deli/market. I did not realize how large the foam cheese earrings were, but she liked them anyway."
2,huge,these are cute but they are huge! the earrings are attached in a way so that the cheese faces in a weird direction so i had to bend them to not stick out so far.
1,Short on Substance,"In this volume Kuhn presents a broad picture of the momentus change taking place within China today. However, Kuhn's presentation of this transformation is superficial. Kuhn seems intent on presenting China as it is presented to foreigners and avoids delving beneath the veneer of officialdom in China. Made In China is rife with textual and statistical quotations from Chinese State agencies and media arms; agencies that well known in most circles to be innacurate and propaganda laden sources of information. Any insightful analysis of modern Chinese society and economy must look beyond the fascade of Beijing politics and party sponsored proclamations. For those interested in an overview of what is happening in China today this book could be helpful. Do not mistake this work for serious scholarship on China."
3,Good but not THAT good.,"The idea & the game in overall is good. But because of its copy-protection program in it, it causes a lot of bugs. Even with my super high-end computer in 2003 (Athlon 2500+ 1.84GHz, 512DDR SDRam, Radeon 9600 Pro-128MB) it still bugs a lot. About the game, the Americans all wear the same uniform in every battles, from Europe to the Pacific which is wrong. The AI lacks a bit of intelligence when given orders or by itself. Reloading is not automatic & should be (like in Medal of Honor Allied Assault), like if you would not reload in a battle?! Good thing is that you're able to use the ennemies' weapons like in real life. The only big problem is the bugs. That's all. & the AI. & the uniforms."
3,Lag and Bugs too much a hindrance to keep it immersive,Too much choppy gameplay prone to lag and control issues. Icky first person gameplay compared to most any FPS. Great ideas controlling the vehicles ships and planes. Lopsided gameplay that heavily favors pilots. Communication a hindrance without real time mic chat built in and a terribly late typed messages. Sometimes almost impossible with skipping key inputs and garbled messages. Therefore any real strategy on a grand scale against the enemy is laughable. Most kids online just 'rambo' and grab a vehicle or plane and take off on their own agenda.
2,Battlefield 1942,"Game kinda sucks....get battlefield 2 instead, or call of duty series.No iron sight views on weps, hud sucks, hit points are weak, takes 3-6 hits with sniper rifle at medium range....dont waste your money."
2,"Umm...Try again, EA!","C'mon. This game has a great interface and all...but a 30 second spawn wait in single player?! That is absurd. The only reason I am giving this two stars is because of the vehicles. You can get in every vehicle. That is the only good point. The AI is awful. They will not even engage in melees. They will just go prone and fire like two shots on their pistol EVEN WHEN their primary gun is a machine gun! How dumb is that?! If you want a good FPS game, buy Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. Much more worth it. And, what's more, MOHAA is actually a good game!"
5,This book helps tremendously,"The examples given in this book helped me tremendously in giving a proper speech, it gave wonderful examples and steps to take in order to execute a successful presentation. I recommend this book for anyone who has troubles speaking or has fears of taking a course or speaking in public."
1,The Natural Speaker or self motivational book.,"Although the book provides the basics for speech, I am annoyed by the fact that it reads like a self motivational book. I suppose that the author intends to make the reader feel warm and fuzzy. Yet I still digress since I did not want a book that made me feel warm and fuzzy; rather I needed it to function as a text book for speech."
5,Excellent from a former professor,"I had the pleaure of taking Randy Fujishin's class some time ago, he is an excellent teacher. He is truly a ""Natural Speaker"" and this editon reflects the technological changes that have happened since I took his class."
5,Haskil's Mozart Shines,"This is a wonderful CD of Mozart's piano music by Clara Haskil, with the Berlin Philharmonic under the direction of Ferenc Fricsay. Haskil tackles the 19th Concerto, one of Mozart's greatest, with glowing results, and Mozart's final 27th concerto is also captured beautifully, and in particular the mood of the finale. The recordings of the two piano concertos are both in mono, but they sound magnificent. The final piece, Piano Sonata K280, is a stereo recording from 1960, and it was Haskil's final session for DG. (She died six months later as a result of a fall at the Brussels-Midi railway station.) As the editorial review states, Clara Haskil may have been a connoisseur's pianist, but let me tell you, I'm no connoisseur (though I aspire to be) and I love this disc."
5,eminem: uncensored,Im going to get right to the point. If you want to know everything about Eminem this is the ultimate book to read.
3,"interesting content, a few mistakes, though","I bought this book back in 2003. Globally speaking, Martin Huxley s books offers some interesting biographical details about Marshall Mathers III aka Eminem aka Slim Shady. His fluid writing style allows the reader to catch some interesting details about the man and the artist.A few mistakes, though are quite disappointing for a book written by a music journalist...Huxley points out that Eminem was born in 1975. Eminem was born in 1972. Eminem s uncle s name, Ronnie Dean Polkingharn is misspelled too. A journalist should verify his sources!"
1,"Sorry, not good!","Having just read ""Crossing the Line"" by Martin Huxley I would like to say, ""Don't waste your time!"". I'm a huge Em fan and this book told me absolutely nothing that I didn't already know. It appears all the author has done by way of research is watch the same MTV interviews that we all have, and regurgitate Em's lyrics from the CD's. I waited ages for this book to be published, but was really disappointed. The only few pages of the book that are worth looking at are the photos of the man himself."
3,only ok,"I didn't like this book much because I already knew most of the things in the book. But I am a huge Eminem fan and there isn't much I don't know. To me it seemed like Martin Huxley just read Rolling Stone and Spin, and watched some mtv interviews and then wrote a whole book. But if your someone who doesn't know much about Eminem, then you may like this book."
1,Inaccurate ...,"This book was an attempt to make money off of someone who has adoring fans. This book had little if no input from Eminem himself. I just recently bought HIS book, Angry Blonde. If you want the truth from the guy himself, buy that book instead."
3,its ok,"I thought this book was o.k. It really wasn't coming from the mind of Eminem it was coming from what was heard and provided me with some false details. Like his birthday, he was born in 1972 not 1975. So I was disappointed when I read that because I was also doing a report on him for one of my classes and come to find out some of the things I had in my report was wrong. However, than again do not get me wrong I learned some things about him that I did not know like his mother always tried to make him sick and he had no father so do not think the book was horrible. However, if you want to know how he got started in rapping and the hard things he had to go through then this book has it. That is what I thought of crossing the line."
4,Great touch book,"My son loves most of this book. He really likes the ""hairy"", the ""fluffy"", the ""shaggy"" and the ""squashy"". However, when we get to ""bumpy"" and ""shiny"", he flips the pages. He's only 9 months so maybe he doesn't get the subtlety of the feel of those two but he definitely knows he doesn't like them. This book would be a 5 if those two pages weren't included and there were two other textures that were more obvious to little hands. He chooses this book over others but when there are 6 things to touch and he doesn't like two of them, it's only a 4."
4,"A good, quick, touchy-feely book","I really like the ""thats not my.."" series. All the books are colorful, quick and cute. We also own ""thats not my dragon"" which I think my son (17 months) likes better than this one but all the books in this series are cute and I would recommend any of them!"
5,great book,"My son is 17 months and loves this book. We have the sign language dvd titled ""my baby can talk"" by baby hands and this book is featured and read for the ""sign"" for book. I thought it might help him make a better connection if he had the book also. It is very short. However, That is about all I have time to read before he is off running."
5,"Big sister loves to ""read"" it to the baby","This book is bright and colorful. Our 4 year old loves reading it to her little (9 month) sister. Our baby seems truly interested in the book and loves to touch, feel, and even chew on it. The text helps with identifying the various parts of the dog (e.g., the nose, tail, feet, etc.) in fun ways. We enjoy it."
2,Disappointed,"Got this book for Christmas for a new one year old who is crazy about dogs. Had high hopes based on the reviews; however, was disappointed to say the least. For instance, the page stating the ""paws are too bumpy"" are not bumpy at all. Also, the nose is not squashy enough. And the shiny collar is not ""touchable"" but rather visual."
3,Short...only a few pages,"I would spend the money and buy the other touchy-Feely books by this publisher. I'm not a huge fan of the ""That's not my..."" Series. The books are short and too simple. Their other books (Fairy, mermaid, farm) have actual stories and more to do.It is nice that this book has various textures though."
5,Seriously sweet book!,"We got this for my very tactile 6 month old. He loves, and his 2.5 year old brother even loves it. I can say I have never been disappointed by Usborne books!"
2,Description is wrong. It does not come with AC adapter,"Amazon's description clearly states that the AC adapter is ""in the box"". But mine did not have one and the product information both at Casio and on the box itself says no adapter is included. This really bummed me out, I asked for this for Christmas thinking I'd be able to fire it up right away, but no such luck. Yeah, you can feed it batteries but now I have to order the power supply to really enjoy it. This is false advertising and I'm pretty upset about it. Actually, while we're on the subject, why doesn't it come with the adapter? Pretty cheesy deal all the way around."
4,Concerto Not Quite Perfect,"Don't get me wrong these performances, esp. the ones forom the keyboard have all of the energy, stength and heart that you would expect from Richter. I can not find one fault with his playing here. It is the recording itself that I have an issue with. The recording balance in the concerto is way off. The piano is always (incorrectly) projected as being louder than the orchestra. If you've ever been to a paiano concerto concert, you know that this is simply not true. Therefore, I give it 4 stars."
2,cheap quality.,I bought this for my size 0 daughter for halloween. These were adult size items that cut her wrists they were so tight. The lace was low quality and itchy.
4,"Good quick & dirty introduction, but...","Quite clearly, this pocket guide does what it's supposed to do. It gives you a quick & dirty intro into the podcasting world. I already know a thing or two on podcasting but for beginners, this is a nice introduction. Why the 'but...'?? Well, there is a small chapter on 'Fixining common audio problems'. This was a very small chapter but I'd like to have that one a bit bigger. Perhaps in an other pocket guide? I liked that part because it kinda gives you shortcuts to some specific solutions to improve your audio, without going in the technical stuff. Very nice."
1,Watching paint dry,"If you like watching a guy put cameras up, this is the video for you. True amateur!The pics he finally shows at the end are clearly of a deer you can see the shadow, but yet he says eye shine to make u believe that it is a big foot. Don't spend your money. I am a huge big foot enthusiast and i almost smacked myself for watching this bunch of bull."
5,Great Bigfoot Documenary! NOT a Hollywood Production.,"This bigfoot documentary takes you on a high elevation expedition in the Olympic Mountains of Washington. Pretty cool! Not like all the other boring TV shows out there. Can't wait to watch this groups other expeditions. Oh, I really enjoyed the snow scenes when the trackers are pursuing the creature, great stuff. The Bigfoot Research Center allow you to visit their website (bigfootresearchcenter. com) to get updates on the evidence collected from the expeditions. I like the fact you can view all casts, audio recordings and pics! Happy to support your research efforts!"
4,It's good but not my Favorite,It's a great book if you like Annie L and Ballet but I thought the portraits were rather safe/conservative/boring compared to some of her other work. But it is still a nice book to add to your collection. It includes a lot of performance photos from other photographers as well. I think it's dated 1989.
2,Like banging your head into a wall repeatedly...,"The product was not in great condition when it arrived. I found the play to be dull and repetitive. Reading it actually made me feel angry. Maybe I didn't ""get it."" Maybe it was just boring and ill written."
5,Very sleek,"I got this to replace a pickle jar that held my utensils, which I had to struggle with every time I wanted something out of it. *Angels singing*! It's much wider, slopes outward and the finish is nice and sleek looking. It's oblong so it can be flatter along the back splash instead of taking up more room on the front of the counter. Inside the bottom are several nickel-sized tapered holes that anchor the utensils so they don't flop all over the place. There is a snap off bottom that just allows drainage if you want that sort of thing."
2,Hard to clean,This holder is big and stylish but as it's stainless steel you'll have to deal with water marks and stains ALL the time! It's really hard to keep it shiny like the picture. I finally got tired of scrubbing it clean and gave up. I should have gone with one of the ceramic ones. Those I could clean with a damp towel and be done with it.
2,Rust after 9 months,"After 9 months of use, my utensil holder has developed a significant amount of rust. It does get wet fairly often since I keep it in the side of the sink where I drain dishes. However, I don't expect ""stainless"" steel to rust so quickly."
2,What could possibly be wrong...,"with a stainless steel utensil holder from a respectable company like OXO? Well, first thing I've noticed is a large sticker on the ""back"" of the holder. Large, not really informative and not evenly placed, so one would think it is not a permanent design feature (covers the logo of the company). However, removal of this ""thing"" is a tedious task! The glue is so strong it is impossible to remove the sticker without leaving gluey marks and part of the paper. Forget about conventional ways to get rid of these residues - scratch marks on a nice brushed finish guaranteed. Paint stripper could probably do the job. Seriously, a ""permanent"" sticker, which will get ruined after a few cycles in the dishwasher? If that wasn't enough, my copy has a deep ugly scratches at the front! Definitely a handling issue during shipment, storage or packaging. These are not noticeable at the first glance, but nonetheless shouldn't be there."
5,Holds up well ..,Purchased this years ago and it still looks like new. It holds an awful lot of kitchen utensils and it's just the right size.
1,did not fit,this product never fit my 97 nissan maxima i am very disappointed couldnt ship it back it would cost me to much money to do soi still have not gotten a radiator for my car still trying to sell this one
5,LA Girl 14,"I absolutely loved this manga. It was sooo cute. This story line is very interesting and the characters are quite charming. ('charming' reminded me of Harry Potter). Anyways, If you like shojo mangas than this is the one for YOU!! There is always adventure, humor, and bishojo in this manga. I have #'s 1, 2, 3, amd 4. I NEED the rest of them!!! This story is just so fun."
3,Wonderful story... if you can read it.,"Well, what's to say? The story itself is a beautiful work. They tell you about that in a lot of reviews. But the thing that really destroys this book is the downright shameful translation - names are shortened, particularly Yukito (only Toya EVER uses the name ""Yuki""). The dialogue itself is completely out of line - I found myself re-reading pages several times. It seems like they literally translated it word-for-word, making matches between each. So it's a little hard to recommend this - if you can overlook the confusing translation, it's great. The art and story are exceptional. It's just, the translation, I can't overlook."
4,"Great, but try to get the bilingual edition","I love Cardcaptor Sakura, the manga and the anime. If you want the manga and can't read japanese, I suggest you get the bilingual edition though, not the Mixx version. It keeps the original cover art, and the artwork isn't flipped (so you have to read it from right to left, but that's the way it's supposed to look, ne?). But nonetheless, this translation is OK."
3,"Mixx, Mixx, Mixx...","This book is not what it should be. Believe me, I LOVE Cardcaptor Sakura, but what Mixx has done to this masterpeice should not be allowed.They have this annoying habit of seeming not to check for spelling errors. I've seen so many in here...And their lettering! They type in the text, in the ugliest and largest font possible, repelling anyone who opens the cover. Speaking of the cover...it looks like someone Xeroxed it and then laminated it. Ick. Not even the original cover.The story is readable in Mixx's format, just not as enjoyable as if it were well-done. If you want a well-done cardcaptor Sakura manga... and buy the Bilingual Comics edition by Kodansha. Now THAT is a job well done.Don't get me wrong, I adore Cardcaptor Sakura. Just not in the horribly amateurish *thing* that Mixx tries to pull off."
5,Sakura - Episode 1 Review,Very beautifully drawn manga. Lovable charecters and exciting story line. Even better than the TV show!
5,Cardcaptor Sakura....hmm let me think...,"I just bought this book. It is the cutest!I love the drawings and that certain style it has. Tomoyo, Sakura's friend, designs her clothes, which although weird, are VERY cute...and Kero is not a CAT. I was misled about this. I would give this book 10 stars if I could!"
3,Cardcaptor Sakura,"Despite the cute charecters, somewhat entertaining storyline, and amazing artwork, I think you'll find that this series is mildly innappropriate. I discovered that upon reading the second book. There was one cussword, and some elements that some parents may not approve of. I know mine didn't. I'm getting ready to try the Tokyo Mew Mew manga books, and hopefully those will be more for kids then Cardcaptor Sakura, and above all, Sailor Moon."
3,Cute!,"Although everyone says the book is best than the anime, I prefer the anime, because it has more details and episodes than the manga. I agree the drawings are very good, but still the TV show wins! But, if you want to keep the story close to you, so that you can entertain yourself anytime you want, I recomend you buy the manga! It's still worth while!"
4,"If you like Gas, you might like this too...","I don't know too much about the background of this album except that it is German.The Germans seem to be doing some of the most cutting edge stuff in the Ambient/Trip-Hop/deep house genres. I like the guitar melodies mixed with deep ambient house,they are melodic and very funky,as well as being mysterious and dark."
1,Disappointed Mom,"It doesn't work!!! I've tried to load the program several times, but when you push start, the screen goes blank. I tried going to the website to look for updates or troubleshooting, but their website is no longer up. My kids were really looking forward to the game, but what a disappointment. I don't know what other recourse I have, but Amazon needs to pull this product."
1,Windows 2000 professional computers dont buy,"Every other game purchased that runs on Windows 2000 ran on my 2000 xp. This one doesnt. Too bad, it looked really good. Tried to go to their tech site and never got a reply.The I Spy series is a great alternative."
1,Doesnt work,"I bought the program hopping it would work for me... well it does half of the time. My son saw it when I first installed and now that it doesnt work he keeps asking me for it... mom fix it please... For a while it wouldnt even read the disk, now that it does, Im afraid to take it out of the driver because I dont know it will work again. What a shame."
4,"So sad, until Gah Dan It helped me install on XP","I have fond memories of my son playing this, but I could't get it to work on my XP computer initially. A review from Gah Dan It called ""How To Run Zoombinis on Windows XP"" had the information I needed, so I've now been able to feed the pizza troll once again!"
5,Excellent,This is a journey that makes you think. It's really addictive for all ages. Try it you'll love it.
2,Pretty good.,"It took a while to figure out what you were supposed to do, and I don't know how much math is actually reinforced, but when we did figure it out my son thought it was fun."
1,Utter crap. Should have listened to other 1* reviews,Didnt install and didnt even autorun on my XP laptop. Tried it on vista laptop and installed ok. However the program is very sluggish and graphics are utter crap. Even a low end video game now a days looks 100 time better.
1,Very disappointed,"I recently bought this game and am extremely disappointed.First of all, it does not seem to work with Windows 7 even when the Compatibility option is enabled. As a result, it would not run on my daughter's computer.When I installed it on my Mac, it did work but then the game revealed its more substantial drawback: it is a boring game with unclear instructions and non-challenging quests.Another technical weakness worth mentioning has to do with the SAVE function. It appears that you may only SAVE the game at specific points which would make you go back and do over and over again quests that you have already done. Getting into the MAP is risky as you are forced to lose your zoombinis in order to get to the options.In sum, this is a very poor game. Your child is likely to be very disappointed, as my child was."
1,Decided to not bother,"We have XP and Vista on our computers. While the game looks really cool and would be a great addition IF you could get it to boot, I decided to pass after reading all the reviews from frustrated XP users.Writing this in the hopes the development staff will get a clue and fix the problem - send a patch - something if they want to keep up with technology or let the thing rust as tech passes it by."
1,VIRUS GALORE,I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT FOR MY DAUGHTER BUT I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THERE WAS A PROBLEM WHEN WE TRIED TO INSTALL IT ON MY LAPTOP. LAPTOP KEPT SAYING ERROR CORRUPT. BUT I FIGURED BECAUSE OF THE OLD OPERATIING SYSTEM THIS PROGRAM NEEDED. BUT SURE ENOUGH WE INSTALLED IN ON OUR REGULAR PC AND WHAT A MESS!!!IT HAS VIRUSES ALL OVER IT!!! DO NOT BUY!! TRIED TO SEND AMAZON A MESSAGE LINKED TO PURCHASE BUT WOULD NOT GO THROUGH. DO NOT BUY!!
5,Algebra Made EZ,"I honestly think this game made Algebra come easier for me. It is a really fun little toy. You take a party of sixteen zoombinis, each of which have different eyes, hair, feet, and noses. (You choose how they look) Then, based on physical appearances (generally) you have to get them through obstacles. For instance a certain ""monster"" only lets zoombinis with red noses pass. There are also games where you have to use deduction. It helps build skills really well AND its fun. This is a really excellent choice for a computer game, probably for ages eight and up (I'm 14 and I still play it)."
1,Check System Compatibilty,"The game would start and then keep shutting itself down. It was probably just not compatible with any of our Operating Systems - we tried it on a number of computers. It's possible the fault was also in the seller. They may have sold us a copy or a bad product, and they refused to take it back. Whatever the reason, I wasn't pleased."
1,"if XP is bad, Windows 7 is worse","I bought this on scholastic.com, for a pretty penny at that, because I loved this game so much as a kid. Trying to get it to run on any OS not 32- (h***, 16-) bit is a joke. :( I'm no computer neophyte, we went through the compatibility settings, virtual PC, screen resolution, etc., etc. Yes, the game is old, but the darn software just doesn't. work. Plain and simple. The Learning Company/Broderbund would do well to update it--it's in high demand."
1,Bummer,"Other reviewers warned this game might not be compatible with my newer PC. However the description and the packaging plainly state it is compatible for Windows XP. After installing the game, when we clicked on it to start, my computer froze and I had to re-boot. I must have installed and un-installed this game 5 times not to mention all the times I had to totally shut down the system. I've finally given up. Very disappointed. I bought this for my granddaughter and had hoped that it would help improve her math skills."
1,Is based on prehistoric OS,Zoombinis Logical JourneyThis does not work on Vista despite trying out all the combinations available in the compatibility wizard.All reviews of this game are five star but the problem seems to be to get the game to work.HAve been googling to find a solution but none seems to work.
1,Disappointing to my child!,"Although my computer meets all the system requirements, this program randomly quits and the entire game has to be restarted. My son was thrilled to have the program and was very disappointed when the program continued to stop working. Save your money! He loves the other game we got - Crazy Machines!! Very educational and fun!!"
1,Problematic,"It is suppose to be a great game, but there was a hitch during installation & so far we have not been able to install it!"
1,Doesn't work!,"I just purchased this software based on the reviews, but no matter what I did I could not get it to work on my computer. I did everything support websites advised, and nothing worked. I think this software is for six year old computers and systems, not updated ones."
3,"great idea, bad graphics","This is brilliant program, I use it for homeschooling. However the graphics are awful, they look like something from an early 90s computer game or worse, which is frustrating because you must discern between Zoombinis based on their differences, and often those features are dull and the same color as the background and you have to press your nose to the screen to tell each Zoombini apart.If they could just update the graphics I would give this program 5 stars."
2,probably won't work on new systems,"I played this game years ago on an old system. Sadly, it will probably not work on any new systems unless they are probably from the 90's. I was left feeling very sad when I went to try it on my newer computers (one is about 6 years old) and it won't work anymore. It's a really great game and I miss it"
1,Couldn't get it to work!,I have an xp computer and have tried the many suggestions given on making this product work. So far none of them have succeeded. So I have not had the benefit of accessing nor using this seemingly terrific product. Greatly disappointed.
5,awsome game,like the title says this game is awsome and makes you think i played when i was younger and am sooo glad its still here!!! ZOOMBINIS FUNNEST GAM EVER i love making the lil guys!! ahhhhh!!! buybuybuybuy!!!
1,Definitely not Windows XP compatible,I am glad that I tried to set this game up before my grandson came for the weekend. It is definitely not XP compatible. I followed their instructions for converting the XP settings on my computer to a compatible setting. The game did start to work but was very choppy and incomplete. I also did not like the theme of the game. Creatures doing mean things to other creatures. I was very disappointed with Broderbund and The Learning Company. Customer service was also very poor.
1,Doesn't even startup on XP,"Reviews look great but the program won't startup.Tried reinstalling several times.Tried compatibility mode (Win 98, Win NT,Win2K).Tried running the exe directly from the Program Files.The initial screen comes up but then clicking on ""Start Game"" does not work."
5,Great game! Fun & educational,"During PRe-Algebra class at school, our teacher told us that our assignment today was to play this math game. Like the other so-called 'games', I thought this was going to be another dumb and boring one. However, this is loads of fun! It challenges your mind and makes it fun. I would recommend this to anybody trying to get a reluctant child to learn or improve their math."
1,did not work for us,"I ordered this for my daughter and she was soooo looking forward to it, but it would not work on our computer. We have a newish computer and I ran all the diagnostics and changed some settings like they asked, but it still would not load the game for play after instillation."
2,Doesn't Work,"I consider myself computer savvy, but I could not get this game to work.The system requirements match, I have Windows XP. The installation was completed without problem, but the game would not play. I really wanted to children to use this game, the reviews are so positive; I really think it's a shame.Software Customer support from the Learning Company is nearly non-existent, and then they tell us to contact another company that I wasn't able to contact either because in the process of getting a customer support ticket, their registration page would not let me get past the mailing address field.What a shame."
5,very nice CD!,"Thanks for your quick mailing. I plan to use this CD with second graders, and the game should fit their age group nicely.JH"
5,Cool Blue Furry Things,"As well as it being a game to home your logic, zoombini's can also be extremely fun. In a way there is nothing so satisfying as watching zoombini's whoop in delight after completing a whimsical and different puzzle. The game is challenging, interesting, constructive and fun. A good buy for young kids."
4,Very fun for any age,"My ten year old has been playing this game since he was 5. He loves it. We even bought a new copy when our old one broke. I even play by myself sometimes, the puzzles are that fun. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it would have been helpful to have hints for the last level of puzzles. We can't quite get a full set of zoombinis through on those last levels. Other than that, it's a lot of fun."
2,Zoombinis,This product stopped working on our computer? We got to play it a few times but jams and doesn't let us click on things? Very frustrating.
4,building logics skills,"My 6 year old granddaughter enjoys this game, and I (the 65 year old grandma) have been impressedwith the 'thinking this through' skills that are introduced - and both us arefascinated with the silly little sounds those Zoombini creatures make!"
5,Builds skill and character,"Aside from teaching logic to children of all ages, this game also teaches self-confidence and self-esteem. Upon successfully completing a puzzle one hears ""Well done, oh wise and trusty guide,""--or words of the like. These magnificent puzzles build skill and character without pressure of any kind. Mistakes are just an opportunity to learn better next time.Each puzzle completed well brings praise and the reward of continuing on the logical journey. But in the instances one loses a few Zoombinis along the road, there is no cause for alarm. ""Don't worry, you'll meet the Zoombinis again later,"" the narrator tells players.The challenges are great for children of all ages and even for adults. I could think of much worse games with which to play of an afternoon with my kids. Even the characters and sound effects on this game are pleasant. This game is a welcome relief from mass-market time wasters. It's fun and education packed together.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
5,Great,Great game. No problems what so ever running Windows 7 professional 64 bit. Installed and played without having to change any of the settings or doing any troubleshooting to get to run.
4,Zoombinis Logical Journey,"I loved this game as a kid and was thrilled to find it on Amazon. The game works great on Windows 7, but unfortunately I haven't been able to get it to work on Windows XP (which can be fixed with compatability mode, I am just still figuring that out). I've been told that it will not work on Vista either, so I would only recommend purchasing this if you have Windows 95/98 or Windows 7. If you are tech savvy and can figure out how to get it to run on XP, then I would recommend this to you too! Great game. I have been able to play it and it brings back many great memories!!"
1,sadly disappointed,"I bought this CD for my seven year old son with hopes that it would be a positive addition to his education. I was sadly disappointed to find that it was violent, dark, and depressing. I do not believe that teaching children to be violent and aggressive is in the best interests of anyone. We must learn to share the Earth with all living beings."
1,WILL NOT RUN ON MY COMPUTER!!!!,All the one stars are right this is not compatible with new computer and just crashes with error message.Bummer!
5,good game for kids,It's a game that all different ages will enjoy. You have to think to get to different levels. I like it & so do my great grand kids
1,I will give it zero if possible.,"This is the worst software I've ever used. Unfortunately, I bought it for my children. It claims compatible to Windows XP, but it doesn't say it wasn't developed for XP. Basically, the software is not stable, it keeps giving error such as""Zoombinis Logical Journey.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience.""It only supports low resolution (640 x 480) monitor. So if you have big, high resolution monitor, it shows a few inches little square on your big monitor.It doesn't have technical support on the phone, only through a website, you need to login and type in all kind of issues yourself. Then you need to wait technical support to reply your trouble ticket.I am an IT professional, but I can't ""support"" this software for my children, with the company's technical support.The software just crashed AGAIN a moment ago."
3,Could be better...,"The Zoombinis are very cute and it's a fun game, but the noise they make is awful! Their voices are so high pitched and annoying. I know what your saying...that I should just turn off my speakers. Well, that won't work because the only way to get directions on how to play the different activities is to listen to the narrators voice. Don't buy this game unless you're buying it for someone under 8 years old."
1,Out of Date,Greatly disappointed with this product. Purchased along with Gizmos and Gadgets. Neither one of these programs would run on my Computer System.Must be seriously behind the current windows!! Not worth returning hassle.
1,Zoombinis Logical Disaster,"Sad to say, that after playing ""Email-Tag"" with the vendor and continually trying everything advised to me, I still couldn't get this game to work. I also have XP and eventhough I set the compatibility mode to one of the younger windows versions, windows shut down on me and I wasn't able to get the disc out of the driver. To retrieve the disc I had to restart my computer. What a disaster! I am just glad I didn't pay major bucks."
2,Not for Mac Users,"Although this product lists for Mac users, don't bother. It is not compatible with System 10 and jagged and pops and unexepectedly quits with System 9. A disappointment because I think our children could have benefited from this. Designers need to update as the technology progresses."
5,Logical Journey of the Zoombinis,"This game is very interesting and very fun. We started using this program in C.L.A.S.S. I like designing the Zoombinis and playing the games along the route. I especially like the pizza one where you have to make a pizza that the trees like. It is a very fun way to learn deductive logic. It is also fun where you have to decide which rocks accept each Zoombini. I also like the one where the Zoombinis have to be matched in pairs according to eyes, nose, hair, and shoes. I highly reccomend this program for it's educational purposes and for it's fun purposes."
5,Recommended Ages,"While the maker suggests this game is more appropriate for older children, my five-year-old daughter and her six-year-old friend enjoy it a great deal."
1,New computer owners - don't buy this program,"I should have listened to others' reviews but really wanted a good math game program for my son. Unfortunately, upon install I got an error message and no way to fix it. Don't bother buying this. If the manufacturer doesn't fell it's worth their time to update their program, Amazon shouldn't even be carrying it!Windows XP users, DON'T BUY THIS! You can't even run the game after installing it, and it automatically resets your desktop settings (creating huge icons), requiring a restart in order to revert back to your original settings."
1,Not Working,"I loved this game as a kid and my kids were so excited to play it. It says system requirements for Windows XP, which we have, but it keeps shutting down and sending error reports. So frustrated with this product! Wonderful game if it works likes it says it should!"
5,T I D of F,I liked this book so much that I bought a second 1 for my friend Mike for Christmas. This book is very informative. It has pictures and information from every fighter from WWI to the present. It even has pictures of some rare planes that I have never heard. P. Corti.
3,No bad for the dough,"Bouth this for my wife and it still works great, but looks pretty rough after two years. For the price, I guess that's not bad, but I always want more for the money."
5,Some clarifications,"contrary to sidoman's review, it is very apparent that M. Lecouteux is not necessarily a believer in the paranormal, but is reporting the beliefs of various people from the past. further, his thesis is precisely that the theme of the Double is much further-reaching than the previously recognized ideas of the doppelganger and similar doubled existences, but extends to the beliefs of the powers of witchcraft, werewolves, and many others. the idea seems to be that the Double (and here i will oversimplify, as the purpose here is not to provide a summary, but only to correct the more blatant misunderstandings of the previous reviewer) is the pre-Christian conceptualization of the ""soul"", and that Christianity brought a very different idea of how the nonphysical aspect of a human interacted with the world."
4,Hunting Wolf,"Hey! This is NOT a book about hunting for wolves. On publication it was well reviewed and went into several editions, including school-use additions. Its a tale of average people and gross injustice set in historic times. Its a good, solid read."
5,Unparalleled!,This set of works for Cello and Piano with Fournier and Kempff is awesome in every way. I won't repeat what other reviewers have said here. The recording is rich and full. And the interpretations are beyond anything anyone else has done with these works. A desert island disc!UPDATE: I recently received the Japanese remaster of Fournier and Schnabel's recordings of these works. While it does not replace the present set it is comparable and worth acquiring if you can find them. Available as an import hereLes Introuvables de Pierre Fournier
3,Fournier/Schnabel reign supreme,"Pierre Fournier and Wilhelm Kempff have some very tough competition, and at the very top of the list is Fournier himself along with Artur Schnabel, whose 1947/48 recordings of the Beethoven cello sonatas are enduring classics of the music catalog. Fournier is in fine shape in the later recordings, taken from live recitals in 1965, but Kempff is a subdued partner compared to the tremendous enthusiasm Artur Schnabel brought to these scores. Schnabel, probably the greatest Beethoven player of the past century, is just glorious throughout the sonatas, combining subtlety with unrestrained joy. Kempff, no mean Beethovenian himself whose sonata recordings project a consistently sunny personality, just doesn't communicate the same electricity. Added to this is the less than flattering sound afforded to Fournier/Kempff.The Fournier/Schnabel set is readily available to the enterprising downloader....Three and a half stars."
3,Isn't the same as newest edition,newer editions have chapters changed in order and have added on new different ones. i bougth this instead of new and still am able to keep up in class
1,Still Described Inaccurately!,"The dishwasher connection is not as described.It is approximately 5/8"" OD, which is different from the photo.Found the correct part for $3.86 at a local plumbing supply.I called and informed Amazon of this problem.As usual, I was issued a free return label and a prompt refund."
1,tailpiece has wrong diameter dishwasher connection,"I should have checked previous buyer's reviews. Seems someone else had the same problem. This is useless for me as there is no way I could use the existing DW hose. I finally found the proper tailpiece locally, which means I didn't have to order a hose also (when I got this tailpiece I decided to get another hose which would hopefully fit). I guess I can't cancel it now (I ordered hose from Amazon also) cause presumably it has already shipped.Next time I need hardware, I will search locally even though it is much more inconvenient."
1,Bad Ink - No Response Via Email,"I received this ink and when we went to use it, it printed in solid black ink and I could not read any text. I tried to email this user a few times with no return email for a refund and return.I would not recommend this user or product"
3,It's the only game in town unfortunatley,"Well, I burned thru one of these bad boys in less than a year and 4K pages. Too bad that NEC printers don't have any good knockoff alternative brand cartridges available."
4,"Hey, it's a freakin' toner cartridge, what can I say?","Well, the cartridge fit the laser printer, and it contains toner, and it works. I can't say how much longer the ""high capacity"" cartridge lasts compared to the regular (""low capacity?"") one does, as I'm not that anal about measuring stuff like that. But if you have an NEC laser printer that uses this cartridge and it seems you're buying a lot of cartridges, maybe you should try this high capacity version."
1,Great Price,"Wow, only 110 bucks for a refill, thats more than the printer is worth, what a great deal!"
1,Underweight and not as described,The package I received is underweight with numerous empty wrappers. That is besides the fact that it seems like the expiration date has been changed. Terrible experience.
3,"""Death Camps""","Various film clips, taken at the end of WWII, exposing many of the Death Camps. Well narrated, graphic scenes. I am a history buff, and have read a great deal on this subject. Difficult to watch just the same. Film clips almost a "" home movie"" type quality though."
5,great music,All three of these symphonies are well executed and are a joy to hear. Buy this 2-CD set and enjoy!
1,"Tchaikovsky Symphonies 4,5,& 6","The Karajan BPO was, quite simply, a great orchestra -- especially in the mid to late 70's It had a depth of dynamic range rarely approached by other orchestras then and now. Karajan's tenure, contentious as it was at times, brought this orchestra together as a compleat ensemble because he and the players knew one another. They also played with pride and dedication to the tradition of the ensemble and the music. The rendering of these symphonies reflects all of these attributes. The quality of the recording is excellent and no one could not dispute the purchase value of the collection. I recommend it highly"
2,The Emperor has no clothes,"Admittedly, this set is beautifully played, and the digital remastering has mitigated the shrillness of the recorded sound DGG usually gave Karajan during this period. That said, the electricity in these performances goes on and off. The performances are cosmetically beautiful, but the passion is there only intermittently--neatness counts, but it is not enough in itself--at least, not in Tchaikovsky. Also, I miss the sort of impetus-giving rubato and the illusion of hysteria just barely under control so wonderfully supplied by Pierre Monteux who understood that ""the letter kills, while the spirit giveth life."""
3,"Technically excellent, but where's the soulfulness ?","There's something about Karajan's approach here that just isn't satisfying enough for me. The music is well played and, at times, certainly dramatic (as well as loud), but what seems to be missing is a sense of emotional depth. The relative flatness and superficiality of expression signal the denial of color contrasts and soulfulness. Neatness, precision and forcefulness take their turns, but with Tchaikovsky, especially, there's got to be a lot more. This composer was not made of vinyl siding and brick. His musical message projects immense sensitivity and feeling. If you haven't already done so, try listening to the Mravinsky/Leningrad ""Pathetique"", particularly the final movement."
1,A photographer's search for the limelight,"What can be said of a person who hangs around a gang of killers for years? Ron Haviv has done just this. Fear and death become trivialized when expensive and stylized books become available for the commercial market.There are photographs that exist from the past that document murder. These photographs were made by the murderers themselves in order to celebrate their deeds or by the victims in an attempt to warn the world of the horrors that had taken place.Haviv was neither a victim nor a spy taking photographs on the sly from the distance. Haviv was in the middle of this carnage. He was the court photographer for a twisted band of murderers, winning their confidence over a period of years. He did not attempt to stop the crimes, he photographed them instead. He did not run from this vicious mob but instead he chose to remain with them.In the book he is referred to as having been brave. I choose to think of him as an opportunist of the highest degree. Shame!!"
5,1993 Award Winning Documentary,From Linda Freeman's series on artists from a creative perspective. About the life and work of one of America's greatest painters. Emphasis on his epic narratives about the struggles of the African-American experience and the emotional aspects of creating art.
4,Worth a listen,"I can't say I loved them, but these stories are generally very well written, and most of them are interesting enough. Worth a listen. Three and a half stars."
4,"Unusual, but effective.","This is quite a good thriller, that has been ignored almost completely. Sean Young plays the part of a forensic artist who specialices in faces seen by witnesses. She ends up drawing a face from her own memory instead of the witness's and can not explain this. It is hardly my place to reveal the plot. Let it suffice to say, that it is quite good and even surprising at times. The cast works well together and the movie has been well directed. Despite negative press and an indifferent public Evil Has a Face is an interesting movie for every fan of crime-thrillers."
2,Not the quality expected,This product was a bit overpriced for the quality received. Although it is a perfect size for a young child and has great shelves. The estimated shipping time took a week longer and the lamp was broke when opened.
3,Body Mounts,These body mounts do the job they were made to do but wear easily. After a while the clip holders start to bow outward and make it difficult to apply the body clips.
3,"Attractive, but disappointing","The Lord of the Rings-Return of the King Student Planner would have been more accurately called a date book/appointment book. The illustrations are lovely, and it does contain a lot of nice extras such as: Calendar pages, class schedule for 4 quarters, grade keeper, lists of commonly misused and misspelled words, weights & measures, and an area for phone numbers and addresses.Unfortunately, the main body of the planner falls short. Each week has a full-page photo from the movie. This leaves only a one-page area, into which is squeezed seven days, each day having just four lines in which to write. Also, there are no subject headings, or time slots.The poor layout and limited space renders this planner inadequate for my son's busy schedule, so now I'm in search of a better planner. I'm keeping this one,simply because he is a huge Lord of the Rings fan. He will use it for appointments,special occasions, etc. But for a student planner, it just doesn't fit the bill."
3,"Great product, but it is the wrong color","Be careful before you order this product, it may come in Silver instead of black. I own a lot of other Yamaha products and I expect this one to be just as good of quality as my others."
2,WRONG COLOR,"Seems like a good unit, but I was assured black was being sent to me and I received Silver. Customer service then told me that black was not available, as they had only received silver from the manufacturer. To top it off, since the box indicated that the receiver was indeed black, I had already given it as a gift to someone before I found out it was silver. So now I need to retrieve the gift, go through the hassle of returning it, and then find another reciever elsewhere."
2,Trying to whitewash Mr. McCarthy,"Mr. Buckley was 29 and Mr. Bozell was 28 when they wrote this book. Their inexperience may be the reason for the numerous errors in the book. They use information as if it were reliable when they should have done some investigation. Of course one of Senator McCarthy's main enemies was himself and the authors review how his behavior was often uncivil and harmful to US security.The book I have is a hardcover issue from 1954 and in it there is a prologue by William S. Schlamm. By the use of hyperbole, straw men and twists of logic he makes an interesting introduction.A good source of information on one of McCarthy's targets is a book by Gary May-""China Scapegoat,The Diplomatic Ordeal of John Carter Vincent"".The interest in the McCarthy era will wax and wane over time but hopefully future generations will return to examine his actions so that they will do a better job of stopping the next demagogue before they do as much damage as Mr. McCarthy."
2,And then there was silence...,"I bought this MP3 player and was initially satisfied with it. It held 1,000+ songs and fit unnoticed in my pocket. The only complaint is that in the duration of it's working life, if I were to transfer full-length albulms, the player would organize it in alpha order and not in the order of the CD. Three months later and out of the blue, the damn thing stopped working for no apparent reason. There is no point in trying to repair it because I've tried everything; it's dead and buried."
5,Great product for the price,"This is a great product. Is is very small (maybe a little bit too small with the buttons) and it sounds great. The very interesting feature is that you don't need to use any software to transfer the files. The system is considered like a hard-drive by Windows.You can also recharge the Nomad using the USB plug (you don't have to carry the adpater everywhere as it is pretty easy to find a computer with a USB port (at least it is for me).The sound, once again, is very good, I will probably change the earbuds as they are too big for my ears.I recommend you this item and the very good thing is that the battery is replaceable.Go get one, it is not worth to spend more on an ipod.True: there are no carrying case and it is a bit annoying."
2,NOT long lasting,"I had this for about two weeks before it 'gave up' on me. I sentit back for repair, but i sure wish the warranty was longer. I feel i shoulda bought a iPod-- longer warranty, & probably alot better built. Other than that the Muvo2 sounds real good, is small & lightweight, but i wish it came with a case (instead of shopping foran aftermarket one). Thats all!"
4,Up 2 Standard,"I bought this product in late 2005 at discount/refurbished. I have dropped it many times, i use it at the gym so it has been subjected to the sauna and steam room many many times. I've used it at the beach, left it in my car in 100 degree heat and freezing temps. This device is now three years old and i'm ready to upgrade but this MP3 will forever live on as one of the best electronic devices i have EVER purchased."
2,"Great player, but breaks quickly","I received a Movo for my birthday, and only 4 months after receiving it, it stopped functioning. I've never had problems with gadgets -- my laptops, PDAs and cell phones have all worked for years.Creative has only a 90 day warranty, and it costs as much to fix it as to buy another one. I'd probably go with a more reliable MP3 player in the future. Ipods, for example, are purported to last at least 18 months."
2,Headphone jack problem,"If you check the Creative Labs forum on their website you will see this product, among other Creative Labs items, have an extensive headphone jack problem where the sound becomes garbled unless you press into the jack or move it from side to side (and keep your finger there). I didn't know this was such a common problem among Muvo owners until I read all the other complaints. When I called customer service I spoke with some Indian guy who gave me the runaround and finally told me to buy a new one."
1,Lame warranty,You would think that something you pay $200 for would have at leat a year warranty. Not so with the Creative Muvo player. I have to say the thing was great up until a couple weeks ago when the headphone jack busted. I am very careful with my player and now it's broken and with no options for repair or warranty exchange. Basically the sound cuts out and disapears and with some wiggling comes in and out. This makes the unit useless and annoying as hell to listen to. I bought the unit back in August making the 3 month warranty worthless of course to me. So now I have a product that doesn't work and am screwed out of $200. I will not buy another Creative mp3 player that is for sure.
1,Stopped working - twice,"For no apparent reason, this player has stopped working. A few months ago I had sent it for repair and they charged me more than a $100 repair to replace the hard disk. Now it's broken again. Will never buy Creative products again."
4,Nomad Muvo 2-Good and Bad,"When I got my muvo 2 i was amazed by its size, its extremely small which is good but the screen and the control wheel are too small but after about a week you get used to it. The battery life is good and if your looking for something to buy at a cheap price and you dont need so many songs this is a very good choice. + same amount of gig as the mini ipod and is 60 dollars less."
2,"Don't waste your money, get an ipod instead","The player itself was OK (when it was working); buttons are a bit small, sound quality is pretty good but software isn't all that great with glitches that require you to take the battery out to reset it from time to time. Just recently, I started encountering problems (as did someone else I knew who purchased the same player) with the head phone jack and unfortunately, it was after 90 days. They wanted me to pay a $40 labor fee to fix their rather inferior product! Plus, the technical support isn't very good. I'll never waste my money on a Creative product again."
2,Protective case with belt clip Missing,"The Product is Great, But what's the use when one can't carry it. The Product Description Says this is Included. To my disappointment, there was no case even the cheapest Players out there give a carrying case or a Neck String. I was checking withthe manufacturer (Creative), this Version of the Product has a hard disk inside and is not suitable to Jog/Run Around with, that?s the reason they have dropped the Belt Clip. I am returning Mine, I would order iPod instead for 30$ more."
3,"WARNING, no case/belt clip","This product does NOT come with the protective case/belt clip that is included in the product description. Whether this is Amazon's fault or Creative's fault I don't know but I received my package today and found everything in order except that there was no case or clip. I contacted Creative and a (rude and extremely unhelpful) representative told me that Creative no longer ships the case with the product. For me this product is useless without a clip because my sole purpose for buying it was to use it while running. In fact I dont even know why I gave it 3 stars. Perhaps the previous version of this product still ships with the case, I don't know. So beware before buying this."
4,a great Handel disc,"Masterful, bracing performances of some of Handel's best orchestral music. Everyone knows the Fireworks Music and this is a very good account (be aware, however, that this is the original scoring with no strings, just winds and percussion; I imagine the sound won't suit you if you don't like things too earthy); you will also really like the Passacaille, Gigue and Menuet, and the Occassional Suite. I'm amazed at the skill of these period-instrument players."
4,True Stories,"I first heard Sandra on the radio in Germany 2 years ago when her""Summer Rain"" was a hit. I finally found this CD and havebeen overjoyed to experience this artist's range of expression. Sandrasings like an Angel, perhaps reminescent of Olivia Newton John butwith more power nd dynamicism. Great back-up vocals and well mixedinstrumentation, this is a well produced album."
3,"Drawer Organizer is ""OK"" but nothing great....","I bought this organizer with the expectation that it would be a little more ""substantial"" than it is. It is OK and works but tolerances and quality of workmanship are only average. It's not worth the effort to return it so I kept it."
1,no thanks,I was tempted to purchase this item because of the reviews but once I saw the full ingredients list I got scared. Yikes!
5,Great stuff!,I first used this product while staying at the Grand Californian Hotel at Disneyland. It works wonderfully and smells as good!
4,I hope they continue to make this for a long time.,"One of the best products they have come out with, it is so refreshing to the skin. Definitely will keep buying it."
5,Great product,"Great price, fast delivery and wonderful product. I really like that it has sea salt and it smells really good. I would recommend this bath wash to anyone who likes to feel refreshed and have silky smooth skin."
5,best v-ball for sand,"after ordering another ball, since the first one got ""lost"" in the mail, i love it and it was worth waiting for. i have played indoor and outdoor for many yrs now and this ball is the only one i will play with outdoors. it is a bit expensive, but once you play with it for your first time, you know it is money well spent."
5,the official avp ball for the best price,"this was as good of a price as I could find on the internet for the ""official AVP"" ball, and its from a reputable supplier (Amazon) that ships quickly. No brainer."
3,VOLLEYBALL,"THE BALL WAS FLAT ON ARRIVAL, HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO PUMP IT UP AND MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE A HOLE. I PURCHASED 2 OTHER WILSON BALLS FROM ANOTHER WEB SITE THAT ARRIVED FULLY INFLATED THE SAME DAY. A FULL BALL WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT. IT LOOKS OKAY"
4,"Pretty good ball, but very lightweight","Pretty good ball. I'm old school and was used to the heavier leather Top Flite's, so it took a while to get used to this. Not so great on a windy day, because it's very light. At a recent tournament most of the younger/outdoor players kept asking to deflate it because they're used to the marshmallow feel and not something so light and tight."
5,Essentials of Thoracic Surgery really is essential!,"This is an outstanding textbook. Not only is it thorough and concise, it is exceptionally well organized and extremely easy to read (not one of those books you save for when you have insomnia!). It really conveys the essential facts which have to be weeded out of textbooks twice this size. I highly recommend this book to anyone requiring a fundamental understanding of thoracic surgery."
4,Fun insight into life at sea for the mate of a captain!,"My husband is also a master mariner (sea captain) although with three small children, we have yet to join him out at sea. This was a fun read to gain insight into life of a merchant mariner couple. . .and so much of it rang true, given the stories my husband shares with me. It's a very different life filled with people from all walks of life. You never know who you'll meet, what you'll see or experience! We hope to have a the whole family out for a few months within the next year. Thanks for the insight!"
5,Adorable unicorn with a shiny horn and paws.,"I love all of the Aurora animals, but this has to be one of my favorites. The eyes are translucent and cute, and I love the sheeny, crunchy fabric on the horn and paws. I'd recommend this for kids aged 6 and up and especially for kids at heart. It's clearly a very mature and magical unicorn from a world far, far away. It isn't too brittle, but it doesn't look like it will take a lot of abuse either. But who would ever abuse an innocent unicorn anyway?"
2,"Daughter Loved It, Foot Tore Within 2 Days","My 3 year old daughter was really into unicorns and wanted a stuffed one to sleep with so I found this one on Amazon. When we received it, it looked nice and my daughter loved it. She carried it around by the leg as many kids do their stuffed toys but within 2 days, the hoof tore open and the stuffing began to come out. We have sewed it up a couple times and she still plays with it but I wish it would have been constructed a lot better. The hoof to leg stitching seems to be very fragile."
5,Niece loved it,I bought this for my nieces birthday on a whim to match the card I was getting her. It turned out to be plushy and something that she really loves.
2,Very very small,"I got this today, I was planning to give as a gift for my friend's 7 years daughter. It is way too small, you cannot give it as a gift. It does not worse the 7 dollars I paid for it.The size of this unicorn is less than 1/2 of your arm.Looks cheap.I do not recommend it."
2,Ride the Big Red Cars,Ride The Big Red Cars How Trolleys Helped Build Southern CaliforniaThe printing was obviously done by photocopy and not done well. The photographs were not clear. Many pages had repeated paragraphs. Although the book was hardbound the quality leaves much to be desired.
5,Zoombinis: Montain Rescue,When I first played this game I was at a friends house. I played it and wanted it so bad! My mom got it for me and I started to play it as soon as I could.
1,Too much of a hassle to use,"The game itself is great, however, at least on my pc (Windows XP with service pack 2, with an intel motherboard and intel on board video) Each time we want to use the game we have to go to start, run, type in dxdiag, go to the display tab and turn off direct draw. Then we can launch and play the game. That's a bit too much of a pain to use. It says it works on XP, but every machine I know of uses direct draw, so this is really more engineered for older versions of windows I think. This game should be updated so folks don't need to go through this hassle. Otherwise the game itself is great. If you don't mind going through these steps (and maybe if you are lucky you won't have to) buy it."
1,Be Careful!,"We have other Zoombini games and love them but can't even use this one. We purchased a brand new computer with a pretty advanced system yet we can't play this game and it was a waste of a purchase.After 40 minutes on the phone with Dell and being assured we had the most up to date Video Card, Sound Card and Cd-Rom drive we are still unable to install this game. We have had no help from the company's tech support either. Unless you are an expert in Video Card Drivers and can get past the ""UNABLE TO SET VIDEO MODE"" error message that we got I'd be careful in purchasing this one."
4,Zoombinis' Mountain Alittle Short ; Mom from NYC,"We ordered this version because the first Zoombinis Logical Journey wouldn't work on our new operating system, MS Media. The kids missed playing the game. The kids and I found the first Journey had more levels of difficulty, thus more challenging. But the game still emphasizes logical thinking skills necessary for math. It was nice seeing and creating the Zoonbinis again."
4,I think it's a great game!,"I like this game a lot. I haven't played it myself, but I've watched my 8-year old brother play it for a while. I like the puzzles and sort of like how it gets harder after you complete each section a certain number of times. One of the things I didn't really like was how long it is. I mean, come on! You have to rescue 500+ Zoombinis and the most you can save at a time is 16! Another thing that I noticed was that some of the puzzles take a LOT of patience.There's one game where you have to give trolls the food they want by listening to the clues they give you. On the beginning level it was fine, but by the intermidiate level he didn't have as much patience for all the things and ended up guessing randomly. Still, I think this is DEFINITELY a good game. I would reccomend it. Also there's several other great Zoombinis games that are also fun."
1,Disappointed Mac Owner,"Don't order this if you own a Mac. It's for Windows only! I was so disappointed because my daughters and I liked the first Zoombinis so well. We've had it for about 5 years, and we still get it out and play with it. I couldn't decided whether to give this new one 1 star or 5, because if it's as good as the first one, and as good as the box made it look, I'm sure it's excellent. Mac owners need to find a way to show software companies that we will provide them with enough business so they can afford to develop these good programs for us too!"
4,A fun and exciting game that can challenge gamers of any age,"The Zoombinis was one of the first computer games to challenge users of any age to try math equations without any numbers. Most people think that math means numbers. Well this game shows those people that ingenius ideas like this can not only teach young children valuable learning skills, but might teach some children better than a math class would. The follow-up however, isnt as original as the first, and the fun factor drops a bit. That doesnt mean you cant enjoy this game. There are still instances where you will find yourself pulling your hair out in rage, but it just doesnt compare to the original. In terms of Gameplay, replayability, and Fun Factor. Sure, its much harder, but a hard game isnt worth playing if it doesnt have anything else to offer."
4,"A bit difficult for 8 yr. olds, some glitches","The reasoning ability needed is said to develop in the ninth year, which we found accurate. Most children under 9.5 can enjoy it, but need a lot of help. Even then only the brightest will succeed without some initial assistance on the more difficult stages, but once they get the idea they can handle new problems on their own.One time the program hung up when we waited a long time on the pinball stage. The delays at the end of some stages are annoying; it is not clear whether it is done.Most important, though, is that the kids love it so far, and they are probably learning something of the listed skills. Ican't compare it with Logical Journey of the Zoombinis."
1,Uses 24-bit Color ONLY,"Do NOT buy this product unless your PC specifically supports 24-bit color! This software would not run on any of my three PC's. If your PC has 32-bit color I don't think this software will work on your PC unless it also supports 24-bit color. Unfortunately, all of my PC's have the better color but do NOT support 24-bit color. This is not industry standard. Standard would allow use of the higher color albeit with a minor hit on performance.Not sure if your PC supports 24-bit color? Right click on the empty desktop. Left click on properties. Left click on the settings tab. Under colors, see if (24 bit) color is listed. If it's not, you may be in trouble.This is the only software out of dozen's and dozen's I have purchased that I cannot get to run on any of my PC's. My recommendation to anyone would be to borrow a copy and try it before you purchase. I am extremely disappointed in this software!!!"
2,Think BEFORE you buy,"Our family has eagerly anticipated the new Zoombinis Mountain Rescue because we loved the original Zoombinis so much. Mountain Rescue has been a big disappointment. Some of the games are difficult to understand based on the instructions given. Even the very easy levels are hard for my children. This was not the case with the last Zoombinis. There seems to be alot of hesitation on the computer both during and after completing some games. Even the voice of the narrator sounds as if he is bored. The graphics are good, but everything else that made the first one wonderful is missing. I would stick with the first one if you haven't already gotten this one."
1,HUGE disappointment,"As a teacher and a player of The Logical Journey of the Zoombinis, I expected the new game to be as good or better. I was extremely disappointed. The animation is not there - the humor is not there - the logic is not as good. Save your money."
2,Zoombinis Mountain Rescue,"This game has problems running on Mac and PC.The video portions skip and freeze every second on the MacBook, and I haven't gotten it to run at all on the PC (running XP).Installation on the Mac is shotty. It says it is not installed on the Mac every time I try to run it.The puzzle portions of the game run on the Mac and my kids enjoy that part.Quite frustrating."
3,O.K. but could use some improvment,"This game is really good, but:1.The games are somewhat the same as ""Logical journey of the zoombinis"".2.The graphics are bad.3.It is not very hard to play. I played 2 days and got 2 games up to the hardest level.I would buy this game if it were on sale but not for regular price."
4,Sound quality and Price = 5 stars; Fit = 1 star,"I ordered two of these and the sound quality is great; however, the fit of the ear piece is awkward, they feel too big and they fall out of my ears."
2,Not comfortable,Maybe I just have small ears but these headphones hurt!! I can barely fit them in my ear and they are so painful that I can only leave them in for short periods of time. Other than that they are great: have good sound and the microphone placement is really good.
4,Nice quality buds,"With the addition of foam pads (purchased separately), these buds are very good, with nice sound quality. Without the pads, they were less comfortable and would easily fall out. If I may be allowed to muse, 'twould be nice if someday someone were to invent such wired devices that didn't tangle so easily--but I guess that's a tall order. Anyway, I'd recommend these to anyone, particularly for this excellent price."
5,Just what I needed!,I am very pleased with this product. Not only can I adjust the volume from my phone but I can adjust it with the headset. I can use this headset for my LG VU and it detaches into a headset with the normal 2.5mm jack for regular walkmans.
1,A1 Ripoff,"The product shipped by A1 Accessories is NOT as pictured and is a cheapo headset dissed elsewhere on Amazon and offered for $2.70 by the same vendor elsewhere. (no ear covers, lousy sound, incompatible connector, flimsy wire, send/end button does nothing). No response from emails and customer service forms filled out and sent to A!.Hey amazon do you take any responsibility for the vendors your promote? Incorrect pictures and product descriptions?Buyer beware."
1,Our system shows what certain items are compatible with....,"I bought this for LG ARENA GT950.first order, not right product and returned it.got my second order, wrong one again.I told them I got 3.5mm plug headset(returned item) and it's not compatible with my cell phone (mine looks more like picture but little different shape) and they said'Our system shows what certain items are compatible with and that is what wesent you.'oh well... they need to update their system because THEY ARE WRONG!I m not gonna return it AGAIN, cuz it will cost as much as new headset."
1,garbage,There is no such thing as a head-set or earbud for the XENON LG500 although the phone itself is very nice. Every head-set or earbud that was suppose to be for this phone I have purchased and no of them work.Hopefully AT&T; will decide on making one.
4,Very Happy With This Headset!,"I just got my headset today, and I'm very happy with it - especially considering the price. The sound quality for both music & phone calls seems to be just as good as what I got with the headset I originally purchased from Verizon. Even with the cost of shipping, it was still less expensive to purchase it through amazon than to try to buy a replacement from Verizon (plus Verizon couldn't guarantee that the headsets they had in store would be compatible with my phone...er, I wasn't asking them for complex nuclear equations...just which headset was the right replacement for the phone I had in hand...still couldn't help me.)The only draw-back is that it didn't come with foam ear buds (is that what they're called?? ear buds? eary booties? anyway...) Not a big deal, since I generally don't use them anyway."
4,Good but not great,"This product works pretty well. The sound is clear, the headset is comfortable, and the clip on the mic makes it really easy to clip onto your seatbelt while driving. However, I've had complaints from the people I talk to that the sound they hear isn't that clear. Other than that, it's a great headset - especially for the price."
1,Disappointed With The Product,It turned out to be totally useless for me as it does not work with LG Xenon. I had selected from the list of accessories for LG Xenon on Amazon. I don't know why it was listed for LG Xenon accessories if it was not compatible. It was not clearly mentioned upfront about not being compatible. It was buried further down on the page. It might be similar to those so many deceptive advertisements where returning is not worth the money it already cost you.
1,Not What I Expected,"The headphones themselves were cheap and not the right kind for my phone. When I first saw them my first thought was that they looked flimsy. I'm going to have to buy a new pair at the AT&T store. One good thing is that the shipping time was good, but that was it."
1,No Assistance,I purchased the wrong headset for my cellphone - I emailed the supplier and asked for their assistance. I received a generic reply which was of no help and was told I only had 10 days to send the item to them No Refund would be given - a store credit.
3,great sound but...,"These headphones have great quality sound, but i don't know if my ears are too big or too small that these headphones don't stay on, they fall all the time. I think they must have been ear-bud type because when you are on the bus, or in any noisy place you just can't listen to anything."
3,ok,It works fine for the money but the wires/cords are a little weak. It was my only option at the time
1,not good,"as soon as i try to use it once it shorted out on me and shocked my ear, i do not recommend this"
5,LG Shine Headphones,I was glad with my purchase here. I read the reviews about the headphones being too big. They are but I found a way for them to fit my ears. I was happy with my purchase.
3,Avoid the Kindle edition,"Yet another Kindle edition that has not been done properly!On my Kindle most of the diagrams are chopped off with lots of text hidden from view (not always though).To the editors: you could have made smaller diagrams in many instances and they still would have been quite legible.the tables are strange because the paragraphs are usually spread over several cells.Heard of fusion of cells, anyone?As to the content, I think it's quite good as an introduction. The authors know their stuff.I returned mine and I'm ordering the paper edition.Update:I've just received the paper edition and I confirm that it's much better than the Kindle edition: both with respect todiagrams and with tables. This makes me wonder about any kindle edition of a book that is full of diagrams with fine details.Maybe the Kindle DX would solve the problem, with its higher resolution."
2,Just for beginners,"This book is just an introduction to UML. All the discussions that could lift this book to a more interesting level are left out. If you are only looking for definitions the book will do. If you want more in depth introductions to best practices, beyond what you can learn in a few hours of reading, this is not the right book for you. My advise - Buy the UML Bible as your first UML book, and spare yourself for hours of research trying to find the best way to get started with UML or just improving your UML skills."
2,Not a good dummies book if you want to develop use cases using UML,"If you just wanted to develop use cases using UML, this is not the book. I found it too overwhelming as it had too many class diagrams. It did not have much examples. Somebody loaned me the book 'Writing Effective Use Cases by Alistair Cockburn' as they suggested, it is a good book for what I was looking for. I will update this review as soon as I am finished reading that book."
2,Brand name and looks can be deceptive,"My son loves K Swiss, it's what I have always known him to wear, so when he sent me a gift card I thought I would try a pair. The shoes looked great when they arrived but the first time I wore them which was to a meeting, I notice they hurt my heels. I was shocked to also find that my heals were bleeding. I did get to return them which I am grateful."
2,Introduction of new verbs should be reworked,"The method of introducing verbs should be reworked. When giving vocabulary for a chapter, verbs are given only by the principle parts that the student knows at that time. When the use of a new principle part is introduced (the perfect for example), the student has to go back and relearn the principle parts for all previously learned verbs."
2,Less here than meets the eye,"Groton has been our class textbook through Greek 100 and, so far, half of Gr 200. At the start we were very enthusiastic about it, especially those of us who learned Latin from Wheelock, but after a while.... The book is similar to Wheelock's Latin, but much less accessible. The layout is dreadful (particularly the appendices). Ms Groton tells us far more than we need (or want) to know about some things: digammas, thematic vowels, quantitative metathesis and so forth. But more importantly, the readings are inadequate and the exercises will drive you nuts: Is it really useful to know how to say ""Either have I now made clear who the stranger is, or shall I also announce what name he has?""?If you are using Groton, get the Ancillary Exercises as well. They're a big help. You might also get the Loeb Xenophon and try to read it with a lexicon. The point after all is to learn to read greek."
5,Great paint set,"This kit is great for quick touchups and color mixing. Same quality paint as Testor's Model Master acrylic paints, but in a handy spill proof set. My only gripe is that the individual cups are not marked with a paint color so you have to refer to the box for the appropriate color. DON'T throw the box away."
2,haven't changed much since I was a kid,"Well, it's been 30+ years since I needed any kind of hobby paint. But now that I needed some I went back to what I knew, good old Testors, althought this is acrylic and not the good old enamel of my youth. I thought the variety of colors in small sizes and mix of gloss and flat colors was just what I needed. It was just ok. The gloss colors are still ok, they look just like the ones I remember. Unfortunately, so do the flats. As with the enamels of old, the flats are watery and hard to work with and give you a strange shiny but not glossy finish. I went down to the local Michaels/ac Moore/Joanne and got flat acrylics for a very cheap price that are truly flat and in more colors than I could imagine."
2,Would you like to eat something 1000 years old?,"Well Picard does in this gruesome tale about food and marriage. The food in here is not to die for, you just might die eating it. Well the main plot is about a young girl getting married to the older brother of the one she trully loves. You can probably guess the end to this one. There is also a conspirousy on someones life. This book is ok, but the food is gross, in one description I almost puked my dinner."
2,Not truly a badly written book.,"I simply found the basic concept silly and boring; technically, it's not badly written. If you enjoy reading books set in traditional Chinese culture, and also enjoy Star Trek stories, you'll probably love this one. I find traditional Chinese culture stultifyingly boring and thoroughly annoying, and would not, once I'd seen that this book involved the Enterprise crew forced to attempt to make diplomatic contact with an offshoot of that culture, have bothered finishing were I not compulsive about reading every Star Trek book.Just a question of taste; this book was not to mine."
2,A great book to read if you have a TON of spare time.,"I'm a huge fan of Star Trek, and I will be impressed by almost anywork but this one just didn't go over all that well with me. Sure the writer uses extremely descriptive language and draws you in at some points, but the story line gets very redundant at many points. Sometimes you just want to get up and scream ""GET TO THE POINT ALREADY"" when reading this book. Bottom Line, if you're a speedy reader and can plow through a book in one sitting you should definenlty pick this one up, casual readers might want to look into more of Peter David's work."
3,"I think the housing is fine, but the bulb didn't last","I had the housing in for awhile with a regular bulb and of course it worked fine. It is a bit of a pain adjusting the height. Do wear safety glasses a piece of loose metal feel into my eye when I was adjusting the height. It isn't fancy, it isn't super stable either on the adjusting hangar bars, but I doubt you will be hanging on it. The trim can mar your paint (and it is a bit finicky to get springs attached) so use a sheet of paper or something to protect paint.I put a GE heat lamp in there and it blew immediately. Worse when I went to unscrew it the bulb sheared off the base which stayed in the fixture so I don't have long term heat lamp use with this yet."
5,Great from Start to Finish!!!,"For an author's first book to be this good, there's got to be alot of talent there. Ms. Bach certainly has that - to excess!! Think Linda Howard, Suzanne Brockmann, Cherry Adair.....I could go on, but you get the picture. Treat yourself to a gem - GET THIS BOOK!!!"
5,Yum!,"There are really no other words to describe this book. I've read it over and over and am still transported to that dark desert road hearing the sounds of motorcycles in the distance. This book has a great story line, great characters and a very HEA ending. Try this book! I don't think you will be disappointed!"
2,No sexual tension...lame plot,"After reading the reviews, I rushed to place my order for this book. Boy, was I disappointed. So disappointed, in fact, that I wasn't able to finish the book. The plot wasn't interesting and the characters were unbelievable. The author kept writing about the characters thoughts and feelings. Dallas immediately fell for Tess...there was no build-up to romance. All in all just not enough plot development."
3,Readable,"The book was seemingly predictable from the first chapter. However, I still loved Dallas and his character. I have read other ""Biker Romance"" and this was not really a Biker read at all. The romance was okay and the book was long but it was worth the reading time for sure."
1,for the kidnap fan in all of us....,"Chapter one- first off, here is a woman, whose supposed to be a big time business woman-and she's far from home, on a deserted highway-forgets to check gas and her cell battery too?!? So she is stranded and alone. Then elk show up by her car, she wonders if they eat meat?!?, then our hero arrives, she thinks he's just swell, willing to ride off on his harley, then a group of bad as* bikers drive up, she finds out he's with them, and he then proceeds to handcuff, gag and kidnap/imprison her? This is supposed to be a romance? This heroine is beyond too stupid to live-she is the poster child for dumb blonde.And this is all in the first chapter!I quit right there-I can see where this is heading. If you like your alpha males to the point of them hog tying you, then you might like this romance-exploitation. It is not my thing, so I'd say do not waste your time or money. This book is so bad it's laughable.No stars..."
3,Jigs and Fixtures,"This is a well done book if you are looking for the type jigs and fixtures that are covered in it. This book does not have basic jigs and fixtures in it, which is what i was looking for."
3,Mediocre,"I was expecting more. He covers a few obvious ships, but some obscure or questionable ships as well.The obvious WWI Brit Battlecruisers are not covered, but the US Four Stackers were. Japanese Yamato is covered (too big/expensive) but the fragile IJN battleships of the inter war period are ignored. The Hood is classified as a terrible ship, even though it was 20 years old when it faced the modern Bismarck (which is also listed as a failure).Few WWII or later Russian ships are listed even though quite a few were duds (only one sub is discussed).Overall I expected more from this author. I bought this book with high hopes, and was a bit disappointed when I read it."
2,"Excited about the book, but disappointed by the content.","I have had this book in my cart for many months because I'm a big fan of naval history. I finally purchased a used copy through the Amazon marketplace and received the book about a week ago. The book is very short and the discussions about each of the ships were simplistic and too condensed, in fact, I believe I was most disappointed with the lack of detailed analysis and insight beyond what you could find say... Wikipedia.Each of the 30 or so ships is covered in about 3-4 pages with a page on introducing the ship and the history of it's funding, then a page or two of its historical demise, and then a page of conclusions. I believe I disliked the conclusions that stated that the ship was actually not flawed from a naval architecture perspective, but because of how the captain/nation used the ship. I believe the book had great promise, but failed to deliver any further insight."
1,1988 Winter Olympics,I have been told this VHS has been shipped for quite a while now but I haven't received it yet.
3,No arguing taste--or style,"I fall into total agreement with John Grabowski (see review below) when he says, ""Boulez--cool, dapper and forever self-possessed--undermines the very intention of this music."" I think he's also right to pooint out that Boulez is distorting Mahler's own score and its many detailed markings (few composers leave as little room for deviation, but conductors deviate anyway). The Gramophone often chides Boulez for his aloof, analytical way with Mahler (they called the first movement of this Mhaler Fifth a ""requiem for a fashion victim""), but they also hedge their bets: ""Boulez's refusal to engage with Mahler's `theatricality' will not be to all tastes, though in music so excessive, this might be counted a virtue rather than a weakness.""That's in refernce to Boulez's recent Mahler Third, which is thudnerously bland and underplayed, even by comparison with his Fifth. I don't have anything to add except that when we say there's no arguing about taste, it's true."
2,Vienna sounds better than this...,"So many people put this at the top of the best Mahler 5's out there and I just cannot agree. The recording sounds choppy, as if each person went into a studio and recorded their own part without the rest of the ensemble...there is no blend to the sound of the orchestra. I definatly enjoy the Berstein or Maazel version with Vienna much more, along with the Mehta/New York Phil, which is a much enderrated recording."
1,Boulez Mahler: think of elephants ballet-dancing!,"Actually the analogy in the title is not accurate. It is not that Boulez is heavy handed, but totally without feeling! It is nice to hear a recording which does not strive to put an idiosyncratic interpretation on the fifth, but Boulez almost perversely prevents himself from getting involved. This may be fine if you do not know the piece, but if you know it and love it as I do, then avoid it at all costs! The whole point, surely is to get Mahler's emotional tensions and aspirations across through the performance and somehow Boulez seems to filter them out altogether, leaving something which is only Mahler in its bare essence!"
3,good idea... but...,"Really a good idea. This ""glove"" however, is really big. It tends to roll around the hand. The liquid shifts. So it takes a little more work and moving around that I'd expected."
4,Alien Visitation,A remarkable story - the kind mainstream media won't touch. It's worth one good read.
5,Something for everyone,While this album is obviously a great pick for belly dancers and drummers alike I can confidently recommend this album to anyone. This review is based on how much I like this album musically. The drumming is simply a joy to listen to. The performances are so clean yet funky beyond belief. I could see this work being considered genre defining the way these essential rhythms are captured. Based on the overall feel and sound this album lays down what I would consider my favorite style of Egyptian music.
4,Probably the best forstner bits for the money.,"I agree with the other reviewers here. These are not the best bits out there. However, they are very good bits for the money. There are some holes that really need forstners bits. These will do the job and should last a good long while with my occational use of them. If you are planning on using your bits frequently, you might want to upgrade to a more expensive set. If I could do it over again, I would make this purchase again."
4,Well made Jock Strap,Feels great on the skin and nicely made. Would definately purchase this item again.
2,huh?,"Ok, I love Jane and Charlotte; but this biography is nearly unreadable. It doesn't make sense--too many vague descriptions of events and unclear suggestions of motives. If you want to learn something, most of the older biographies are written in a straightforward style. The facts haven't changed since they were published."
1,"No science, no evidence and no facts - just fantasy","Quantum mechanics definitely does *not* say that our mind influences matter. Observation does - but that can be by a speck of dust or by a cricket bat or a light beam. Quantum mechanics is about chance - wave functions can ""collapse"" into different states, but this is random, just like playing blackjack. We can calculate the odds, but that's it. Most significantly, no experiment has ever shown an ability for humans to influence these probabilities just by thinking about it.And there is zero evidence that water has a memory - zero evidence, and zero explainable theory for how this might happen.I'm afraid this movie is just wishful thinking, and should be treated as nothing more than a fantasy flick."
1,A wonderful piece of pure fantasy,"The scary thing about this film is that so many people will take it serously. Much of the ""science"" is pure techno-babble, on par with the ""science"" of a typical Star Trek episode. Do a little research of your own and you'll find that most of the ""researchers"" quoted in the film make no claims to following scientific methodology. NONE of the fantastic effects of water described in the film can be predictably replicated. Most of the ""historical accounts"" in the film are pure falshoods.A nice piece of fiction, but PLEASE don't believe a word of it!"
1,Diluting Steinsaltz' philosophy into the waters of quackery?,"I did not watch this video. Surely, I am not going to watch it in the future. It is really disturbing (and depressing) for me to come to know that Rabbi Steinsaltz, an outstanding kabbalistic and talmudic scholar, also very close to Chabad's chassidic philosophy, appears in a video along with a man like Masaru Emoto, a Japanese photographer who pretends to change water's chemical structure simply by whispering kind words to it. I sincerely hope that Rabbi Steinsaltz will repudiate this DVD in the very near future: Mixing religion and bogus science ends up in nothing, even at extremely high dilutions, no matter what homeopaths say."
1,The Mystery of Water,"This was absolutely the worst film I have ever watched as a documentary. I could not finish it. It rambled on and on without substantive facts or hard, repeatable scientific evidence. There are plenty of things to peak an interest but I thought most of this film was bogus."
4,"Good but not a ""What the Bleep""","There aren't many products like this to my knowledge so the fact that exists is great. While the film interviews scientists, the level of information it provides seems ""dumbed down"". Part of that may be that the film looks like it was made in Russia and the translation may not be capturing the message fully.I personally wanted more science. I perform healing work in water (www.theradianceprocess.com) and I was looking for something I could use. I have an engineering degree so my capacity to understand the science is better than average. I would have appreciated more depth."
2,neck split from body,When we first got this guitar we were impressed with its sound and size.now approx. 8 months later the neck has split from the body. To make matters worse amazon doesn't even show I made this purchase or any of my other purchases in my account under 2007. So basically I am sol in trying to get any type of retribution for this problem. Buy at your own risk.
2,skipworthy........,"My review-this anthology was below average at best.Carola Dunn's story was cute but problematic- being a short story, the H/H fell in love at first sight, and very implausibly as well. Karla Hockers story was better, but way too short, it would have been better served as a full length novel. Finally, Judith Lansdowne's story was fanciful to the point of weirdness, I just couldn't finish that one. Overall-not recommended. 2 stars."
4,Fun romances with a fairy tale theme,"Contains 3 short stories based on fairy tales. I liked the first and the last stories better than the one in the middle. The first one was new version of Aladdin's genie, the second about the Seven Swans, and the last was a twist on The Nightingale.I see that several reviewers did not like this book at all, but I thought it was fun. One of very few romances that I actually plan to keep.CMB"
1,My Opinion Is That It's Books Like This That Gives The Romance Genere a Bad Rap!,I had this book too but I didn't like it. I thought it was cheesy and boring but I respect that other reviewers actually liked this book as after all everyone is entitled to their own opinions but for me personally from now on I'm going to to be be a lot more selective about the short story romance anthologies I buy! This one was a waste of my money and my time! I personally feel that it's books like this that give romance books a bad rap!
1,Hokey!,"I don't always mind a romance book that has some kind of a theme going but this is just too darn silly! I picked this up by mistake in a used book store while getting a bunch of romance book companions, the type that have short love stories by several different authors and I simply just didn't like it! I have a relative who's always saying don't judge books by their covers and don't judge stories by their titles but in this one you sure can! They are just so hokey and quite ludicrous! These authors can and have done better! Sorry but I just prefer a themed romance book companion that doesn't insult my intelligence!"
5,Profoundly relevant book inspires children and adults alike,"Having worked with children in the capacity of a photography teacher, I can attest that the number one thing that keeps many from reaching their potential is a lack of self confidence -a feeling that they can't do it.This book eloquently demonstrates that not only should we be relentless in the pursuit of our dreams, but also, we should be flexible enough in our thinking and attitude to recognize new possibilities and opportunities that present themselves to us. Dwelling on what we can't do not only inhibits us from achieving our goals, it also causes many a missed opportunity to succeed in areas in which we have not yet dreamed.Alexandra Keeper of Dreams brilliantly walks the line between being simple enough to break through to a child and deep enough to really make an adult think.Highly recommended to anyone young or old!"
4,Korngold's Symphony & Much Ado About Nothing music,"The principal work on this CD is Erich Korngold's Symphony in f sharp major that was first performed in 1954, three years before the composer's death. I have always found this a rather difficult work to listen to. It seems to me to have a disturbing undercurrent throughout, though that is not to say that it is not a worthwhile piece of late 20th century music. It is certainly more in the spirit of the second Viennese school of composers than Brahms or Strauss. It lacks the reassuring tonality of the violin concerto, for example, or even of the other work on this disc - the suite for chamber orchestra that Korngold produced for a 1920 production of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing in Vienna. This is a completely accessible work for any music lover and makes a sharp contrast with its companion piece. The works are performed by the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by André Previn."
5,Fast shipping,"Haven't installed it yet, so I really can't leave any review, I mean it's a filter, it's gotta work so..."
5,A touch of whimsy,Lots of great comments but the most unexpected came from our mail lady who just loves it saying she hasn't seen anything like it before.
3,Pierre Moerlen's Gong - 'Breakthrough' (Arc Music),"Tasty 1994 release by the late Gong drummer. Better than I had expected. For a spell, forget about Gong and consider this CD to be a worthy fusion effort - for your listening pleasure. Tunes that certainly make this disc worthwhile are the awesome ""Six 8"", ""Children's Dream"", ""Road Out"", ""Romantic Punk"" and the seven-minute well-written ""Far East"". Line-up: Pierre Moerlen - drums, xylophone, vibraphone, gong, synthesizer & vocals, Ake Zieden - electric guitar, Hansford Rowe - bass, Dag Westling - acoustic guitar, Christer Rhedin - synthesizer & moog, Nina Andersson - saxophone & vocals and Lena Andersson - vocals. Couple of other title by Pierre Moerlen's Gong you might want to check out are 'Leave It Open' and 'Full Circle - Live 1988'."
2,Very weak Gong,"I had always wondered about this CD. Being a Pierre M. Gong lover, I admit my expectations were high. This is the worst Gong record for the fusion ensemble of the band. ""Time Holds the Key"" is pretty bad, but it does have some redeeming qualities. I suppose this one does too...but also released in 1986 was the masterful ""Second Wind"" album, which is a great ""downplayed"" Gong album. But Breakthrough is really weak. It is NOT breaking any new ground. It is a collectors piece though so keep your expectations low. Mediocre spin."
5,among the best books on derrida,i am typing this with one hand with my eight month old daughter asleep on my lap so excuse the brevity. i just want to say that i have read a number of books by and about derrida and i think that this is one of the two or three best. i am a college english instructor and found the chapter on conrad's heart of darkness especially helpful for thinking about deconstruction and texts. get this book. you won't regret it.santi464@netzero.net
1,ALL STATIC NOISE! GARBAGE!,Got these hoping they'd be yet another quality Bosch product. Bosch unfortunately sold this brand years ago. So the quality is beyond acceptable. The sound is all static and noise. I quickly replaced these with Clear Boston Pros.
5,Amber Goggles Best,"I have been wearing Amber View Visio Goggles for competitive swimming for about 5 years after it was recommended by my coach. They are very comfortable. The amber color cuts down any high glare, bright light conditions in both indoor and outdoor pools. The amber color increases contrast, so you can see better for your races. On a cloudy day outdoors, the amber brightens up your view. I have a smaller face even though I'm 6""2"" tall and the Visio goggle fits great. They have soft, thin rubber eye cup gasket not foam (usually leaks) and not like silicone gasket (leaks). I usually order them online for about [..] because at a meet they usually don't sell this brand."
4,Pilgrim Stars is what the movie wished it was.,"With 'Wing Commander', the author was limited to adapting a screenplay. Despite the limitations he faced, he managed to make the book infinitely better than the film. 'Pilgrim Stars' goes beyond the movie, continuing the exploits of Blair & Maniac. On the brink of a new civil war, Blair must confront his heritage, and his role in the universe. Telep's dramatic overtones, created by adding more depth to the characters (and using some character's shallowness), and adding situations that mirror our own dark past, result in a throughly entertaining read that is both dramatic, and at times funny. I can't wait for the release of the third book in the series."
3,Somewhat disappointing (But not a bad effort!),"I read the first novel by Peter Telep and was quite impressed by his abilities to transform a okay script into a very entertaining story. His characters were interesting as were his explainations of the various issues overlooked in the film (which I also liked.) However, Telep's latest work leaves much to be desired. The course the story takes in Pilgrim Stars seems unrelated to the previous book as the actions of the characters. His depictions of people like Paladin and Angel are very different than the people presented to us in the previous story. Paladin's final defection (spoiler) seems incredible and more than that not credible. The force like powers Telep gives his characters also fails to distance Wing Commander from Star Wars. I am a big Wing Commander fan and have read all the novels. I would like to see Telep continue the series, but attempt to make more use of the expansive universe created by Roberts."
2,"Oh no, you got Star Wars in my Wing Commander!","I haven't liked the whole Pilgrim story since I first heard of it. First of all the idea of evolution so quickly is laughable, second these people with this 'magic' powers in a sci-fi universe is nothing more than a silly ripoff of Star Wars (at least Mark Hamill didn't have to face this in the WC games). I for one do not even deem these books as part of the WC universe, but rather some silly offshoot universe where pilots are teen hearthrobs and Star Wars ripoffs abound. It's all gone so downhill since Baen stopped making the books. First WC: Prophecy, now this. ::sigh::"
3,Fine technique but lacking life,"Bach was a very 'correct' composer. His works are always very formalistic, mathematically precise in their structure. I enjoy some of Bach's music but the organ music does not appeal to me very much and certainly not when played as clinically as Walcha does play it. There is more needed from the performer to bring these pieces alive. This is simply too cold."
2,bad registrations,The sound seems heavily slanted towards the treble and Walcha chooses the most ear-aching high pitched pipes. This may not bother some listeners but it literally makes my stomach uneasy.
5,One of the Great Bach Organ Recordings,"Helmut Walcha was one of the Great Organists of the 20thCentury. His recordings of the music of J.S. Bach prove this.He could perform the works from memory and learned to play inspite of the fact the he was visually impared (Blind) I haverarely heard a better performance than his one of the Toccata &Fugue in d, and this recording shows his ability to give eachwork its own special feel These Two CD's are derived from aseries of recordings he made for the DG Archiv label in the1950's and 1960's I think they stand the test of time, and ata Two for One price are a great buy."
2,Why aren't any of the example companies making any $?,"I'm always skeptical of anything about the web with the word ""killer"" in front if it, and this book lived up to these expectations. The book constantly uses theStreet.com and Salon.com as examples of the strategies the book is promoting without mentioning that both of these companies are in extreme trouble right now, struggling to make the ""content thing"" work. Not much really new here either, but for a general overview of net content business models, it's not bad."
5,Glad to find an old childhood favorite!,Remembered my mother reading me this book as a little girl and had to order it for my daughter! I love the story of the strong little house standing the test of time and being loved by all her occupants. The pictures are great too! One of my favorites and I'm sure my daughter will love it as well!
4,Childhood Classic,"The Little House is an endearing story depicting the journey of a little house from a quiet, simpler time through the modern jungle and finally back ""home"" again.This classic belongs in the personal library of every child. Children will love the pictures, especially the little house's almost ""human-like"" features that transform from ""sad"" to ""happy"". Parents will appreciate the interpretation of the ""there is no place like home"" lesson."
4,Charming story with a purpose,"Although this award-winning children's picture book was written many years ago, it is amazingly relevant for today. The story follows the life of a little house, built long ago in the countryside and then slowly swallowed up by the spreading tide of urbanization, only to find itself surrounded by tall buildings, noise and hubbub, and condemned to destruction. The house is restored to happiness by being moved back out into the countryside, where it can once again ejoy the night sky and the songs of birds and laughter of children playing. Young children, age 2 to 6, will enjoy the story and pictures, even if they don't care about urbanization or anything else."
4,A little house yearns for the trees and hills of its past.,"The noted children's book about a house built on a hill away from any town. As the years pass, the city comes closer and closer and eventually surrounds the little house which misses its old hills and trees. One earlier reviewer expressed concern about the apparent anti-urban bias. I think Burton simply had a pro-nature bias rather than anti-urban. And, I think any of us, including those who live in cities or suburbia would not care to live in the sprawl that was depicted in the illustrations and was indeed present in many cities in the 1940s when the book first came out. The book won the 1943 Caldecott Medal for best illustration in a book for children."
4,A Classic,"This is a little like a child's introduction to the problems of rampant urban development! It certainly was that for me.It's a sweet, well-organized and beautifully illustrated story of a little house that had a whole metropolis built up around it. She (yes, the house is referred to in the feminine) gets a new life on a new lot in the country when a descendant of the original owner discovers her amidst a smog-choked, noisy city.One poignant thought: more than fifty years ago, when this story was published, there was still plenty of rural room to just pick up and move to. In this children's story some social historian could find some fine irony about the postwar suburbal exodus. But aside from an unwanted tinge of ""we can run away from our problems,"" the story was able to point out for this young listener the ills of pollution. Still in all, a wonderful book."
5,Even 3 year old can enjoy this book,"I thought this book would be difficult for my 3 years old son to enjoy, but, when I first read to him, he likes it. Thereafter, he would ask me to read it over and over again. Even though he may not understand the message of urbanization in the story; but, there are plenty for him to enjoy. My son talks about the four seasons, in fact, he learns about the four seasons through this book. The illustrations are simple, but amazingly detail. My son would point out all the animals, flowers, children playing in the countryside and what they do in each season. When I get to the end of the page, he would say, ""The little house is happy!"" What a classic, I love this book and will own it for sure."
4,Sweet story,"I enjoyed the story. It was a little beyond my grandchildren but they enjoyed the beginning. As they get older, it'll mean more to them."
5,my son looooves this book!,"I remember reading this book as a child and loving it so I got this for my son (who just turned 4), not sure of what his reaction would be. Afterall, I'm a girl and it might be more of a girly sentimental story. But no, my son loved it. He got soo excited to see the same little house but everything around it changing. He even started screaming when I'd turn the page to show the buildings starting to grow taller and taller around the little house & make train sounds to show how busy the city life was. I asked him after reading him the story ""do you like the city or the country""? And he said ""the country b/c it is quiet & nice."" :)"
5,Beautifully Illustrated with Wonderful Message,"This is a simple story with profound messages that young children definitely will get and think about. The illustrations are also lovely and compliment the value in this book because they capture the attention to promote the learning of the lessons the messages put forth. Having taught Sunday school and worked in a daycare, I recommend this book. It is a wonderful addition to any library.F.M. Lang"
2,The Little House,The Little House is about a little house that is built with care and is lived in until a city grows around it. The little house always wanted to live in the city until it actually happens. It teaches that you should be careful about what you wish for. I think the age level is around 7-9 years. The book was ok it was kind of boring
5,The Little House,"A classic children's book, Virginia Lee Burton reveals the four seasons through the life of the little house. Children love the narration as the city slowly grows and dominates the countryside where the little house lives. The progression of illustrations from the peaceful countryside to the bustling, crowded city fascinate children of all ages. Readers share feelings of loneliness and sadness as the city growth slowly squeezes happiness from the little house. The ageless ending satisfies children even though the summer fun of a ""water hole"" is missing. Perhaps the great-great granddaughter of the little house will build one!"
5,my favourite children's book,"I received this book when I was seven years old from my grandmother, and I loved it immediately. I still do almost four decades later. It's a classic. Some might detect an ""anti-urban"" bias, but I see it as assuring children that, despite the uncertainties of a changing world, what matters is that someone cares for their happiness."
3,Doesn't stay inflated. Poor quality,"The beach ball is just a regular beach ball. However, I was disappointed after spending so much time inflating it, only to realize that the top plastic closure doesn't really seal the ball well. As a result, the air leaks out and it deflates quickly. Given the size of the ball and the fact that it's used in water, eve the slightest deflation will cause it to not really bounce on the water. So once inflated, our kids had to be extra careful when playing with it so that the plastic closure doesn't open up. Picked up a similar ball from TRU and that was slightly more expensive, but only by a few bucks and works much better."
2,Ball deflates quickly,"This review had to be good or bad, unfortunatly its bad. The ball stayed inflated for a few hours, but then deflates. So pretty much everytime i go outside to play with the ball i have to inflate it."
4,Vaporized,"Turning Japanese- great song. Lots of tunes from New Clear Daze that I had on vinyl. The Vapors are the Vapors- great band, but limited exposure."
4,"serious summer reading, indeed","...a very good read for anyone interested in investing in securities, even if only so you understand what to expect from the market.However, the best book of the last 40 years...is not. I'm not sure which book would merit that designation, but, depending on what you're looking for, there are some contenders. At the top of the best books of the decade, that it is, even if only because it brings together a lot of information and, I think, the *right* information: don't get your hopes too high, how not to do it and then how to do it.If you're serious about going at it alone, your next best bet would probably be Morningstar's ""Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing"" and work your way from there, if you're still at it alone :). If not, Mauldin's book gives you enough pointers why and how to find some good value funds, based not on their relative, but decent absolute returns and stick with them."
2,Interesting but tedious,"Mr. Mauldin writes in the beginning of his book, that the reader might find the first portion rather tedious, but to read it anyway. Well I did, and he is right, it is VERY tedious. Secondly there is a paucity of specific advice regarding investments to make today (admittedly the book has been in print over a year). For the average investor, I would say save your money and time and look elsewhere."
3,Good warnings & analysis; little advice for small investor,"The book provides warnings about the upcoming bear market and the reasons for it. Mauldin says that money markets will beat stocks over the next 10 years. However, he doesn't provide the small investor with solid advice for where to invest. He ignores mutual funds and ETF's and does very little on asset allocation. If we want to earn more than 1% but can't get into a hedge fund, the other options he advises are nonexistent."
5,The best book I've read in the last five years,"Rarely does a book on the topic of investing and the economy qualify as ""can't put it down"" material, but this one does - I finished it in a short weekend.Immensely readable, the book provides a framework for understanding an investment world that seems no longer to play by the rules. So many books of this kind come across as alarmist or naive, but Bull's Eye Investing is rational, methodical and comprehensive in its' analysis of everything from underfunded pensions to global demographic trends.The book left me with a 'bearishly optimistic' outlook for the next decade. Mauldin makes a compelling case for caution as a small investor, but also identifies strategies and analytical approaches that provide the reader with a path forward even in what he calls the ""Muddle Through Economy.""In the end, Mauldin's concise recipe for moving forward as an investor is nothing less than gourmet fare."
4,"Good book, in theory.","Good book, in theory.Remember Mr. Mauldin is a business man and he is in hedge fund business.He needs to promote his business.He needs to cry bear.Who cares about secular bear?If I listened to his advice and wrote covered calls in 2003 I would have lost my shirt instead of making 50% on my money.Cheers."
4,Types of libraries,This book gives the read pause for thought at the possibilities of the wide differences in types of libraries that are in existence in the United States. Have you ever been to a tool library?
3,Nice shoe,"For the price I expected more, e.g. softer leather, more comfort etc. They are quite nice though, not exceptionally so, just nice."
4,This book is the ULTIMATE.,"After spending almost a year researching the breed of dog that would suit me best, I finally found Zoe, she is the best companion, and my best friend. The Ultimate Rottweiler is an excellent source of information to help the first time owner of this awesome breed. My dog is almost a year old, wish I had had this book from her first weeks with me, but it is reinforcing all that I have done right, and a bit wrong. Socialization is of upmost importance with this breed. Excellent book."
5,Excellent book for people looking for Rottweiler information,"Of all of the books that I've read concerning the Rottweiler, and I've read over a dozen, this book is by far the best. The information concerns training, diet, health, history, breeding just to name a few. It really is the Ultimate for information. My friend lent me his so I could see if this was really the breed of dog for me. I liked it so much I had to buy my own copy for reference material. Good luck with your future companion."
2,Thoughts after 1 year..and now after 1 1/2...,"At first I was pleased with the capabilities of the device; phone, a real Palm, upgraded screen. Time has tempered my opinion. Buggy, poor audio quality, slow browser, tricky to upgrade especially if you're Macintosh-based and an OS that has not substantively changed in years. A great (and costly) disappointment.UPDATE: After 18 months, the speaker quality steadily deteriorated and my outgoing conversations became inaudible. The connection for the charger no longer functioned reliably and the batteries had to be charged in the base unit (had several friends who experienced similar breakdowns). Now only works as a Palm Pilot, and a heavy one at that. Would have to reduce the rating to a 1/2 star if I could. A truly inferior product. Stay away from the Treo! Would think twice about the 700."
2,Treo 650 A Disappointment for Palm,"I am a committed Palm user, heavy traveller, and technically savvy. I am sorry to say that after trying for 3 months, I am abandoning the treo 650 as a disaster. The system software is continually crashing (despite updates), the phone is erratic, and syncing and file management has been a nightmare. I have put in many hours to try and fix it, and had one unit returned because it was defective. But today I've decided to stop bothering, abandon the unit I paid $500 for, and go back to my normal cell phone. Badly done Palm."
3,"Alot of potiential, but way too buggy","The treo650 could have been an almost perfect device (just add wifi to it, and possibly change the keyboard). However, there are numerous drawbacks to it that all buyers should be aware:a) The phone sometimes turns itself off w/o telling you (havent been able to figure out the cause).b) Alot of people have issues with the sim cards becoming damaged or not connecting properly resulting in calls that drop.c) The bluetooth sound quality is pretty badd) The new flash memory format used in the 650 results in many apps either breaking, crashing the phone, or subtle bugs.Palm seems to be aware of all these problems and have substantially redesigned its new pda models (the TX solves most of the software and memory issues). At the moment, I've decided to just use a blue tooth phone with the TX rather than an integrated device."
2,Freezer Burn,"i find the treo 650 is rather moody. it tends to freeze a lot, requiring resets. also, if you use exchange for your emails, you would have to buy a new server and get ""good"" software, which costs around $1,700 per year. also, the treo 650 bluetooth does not work with my Lexus. i have had to dump mine and buy a blackberry - something i am loath to do. HR"
2,"I LIKE THIS KIND OF PHONES, BUT NOT THIS USED ONE I PURCHASED!","I HAVE BEEN USING THE TREO650 FOR OVER 4 YEARS AND UNFORTUNATELY I COULD NOT FIND A GOOD REPLACEMENT. IT IS VERY EASY TO USE AND VERY PRACTICAL WITH CLEAR PHOTOS AND SCREEN. I GOT THIS PHONE FROM SINGULAR AND ONCE I HAVE SWITCHED TO T-MOBILE I GOT STUCK WITH THEIR PHONES WHICH I NEVER LIKED. I HAVE UNLOCKED THIS PHONE TO WORK WITH T-MOBILE, BUT AFTER 4 YEARS IT IS WORN OUT. THE REPLACEMENT I GOT IS NOT AS GOOD AND I HAD TO SEND IT BACK. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL TREO650 WORK THE SAME, SO YOU HAVE TO BE LUCKY TO GET A GOOD ONE!"
3,BUYER BEWARE OF YOUR CONTRACT,My wife and I absolutely love our phones. I am writing a warning however to alert people that this phone automatically connects to internet for whatever reasons and your cell phone service is charged tremendously without an unlimited data/internet plan. Our normal cell phone bill for both phones is typically $120. We just received a bill for more than $1100 (no joke) and our provider whose name rhymes with horizon said there was nothing I could do and it was my fault for not having unlimited data service. Just beware!
3,"Great Palm Smartphone functionality, poor performance!","Actually, this phone had all the makings of the breakthrough product which PalmOne needed to compete against the Blackberry. But, this phone was plagued with constant endless automatic rebooting and automatic shut down of the phone feature. Certainly, these symptoms are not typical of Palm reliability and stability that their users have come to appreciate. Review Update 3/11/06: As these issues were resolved with update 1.2, I can now finally recommend this phone."
2,problems upon problems,"I researched this phone before I purchased it; spoke to users on line read the reviews. Admittedly when I first used it I LOVED IT, through my recommendations my friends bought it (a total of 7 purchases) SINCE then (less than a year).... the problems are too much to bear -1) The touch screen needs to be calibrated before EVERY use.2) The screen freezes.3) It drops calls ALL the time.4) Buttons have started to fail.5) The cable needs caressing to hot syncBottom Line DONT BUY THIS PHONE.After trying to get help online - DONT BUY A PALM product.I am at a loss as to what phone/pda to buy next.I am so sorry this has happened I used to have high regard for the Palm products, I have had 3 over the years and I loved each of them. Except this one, too many problems."
1,Treo 650 Great functionality - TERRIBLE PHONE,"Yes this phone has great functionality but it is a terrible phone. I went from a Samsong tiny flip to this phone, what a dissapointment! About 35% of my call are dropped, and about 40% of the time I dial and put the phone up to my ear nothing happens and I look back at the phone and it's back to the main screen... no call. I make about 100 calls a day so I really can't deal with this type of inconsistency. I you make a high number of calls DO NOT GET THIS PHONE. I you just get emails and play games this phone is fine. It is by far the worst phone I have every had, and I've had at least 30 cell phones. You will want to throw it into the nearest piece of concrete you can find! Will someone please make a palm phone that actually works as a PHONE!"
1,Not recommended,"I am probably one of those happy amazon customers who has had a terrible experience (every word I mean) with this purchase. I am stuck with a malfunctioning handset and stuck with no choice but to send it back.I was clearly not expecting this - though I did happen to read thru some reviews strongly recommending against this purchase! The problem with the purchase is - the KEYPAD JUST DOESNOT WORK - it FREEZEs. The misery and frustration doesnot stop here - I was clearly refused of any exchange / swap with the Palm Support in Singapore - simply because it was purchased in the US. Wonder, are we actually living in a Global Community or is it just ""nice to hear phrases""!My advice - donot buy it - else be ready to be faced with malfunctions and Zero support. I plan to return it back to Amazon."
5,Great combination!,"I use to carry a PDA and Cell. Had to charge these independantly. Now I have both and charge only when needed. About every three or four days (depending on use). Having the VGA camera is great, specially when I don't have my digital cameras on hand and just want a snap to e-mail. I've bought the Smarlist and Beyond Contacs from DataViz and rate them a 9 (1-10) and the Treo 650 runs them with no problems. I'm pragmatic and do not use an expansion card but just what I need and 32 MBytes is enough. I erase what I do not use. I'm sure in time the 680 will improve it's bugs and in due time I'll upgrade."
4,Treo 650,"Got my unlocked GSM Treo 650 about 3 weeks ago and have been using it since. Although it's a little bigger than my old Nokia, I really like having all my contacts at my finger-tips.I haven't had any real problems with the unit: it does reset itself once every few days, but I have a lot of 3rd party apps on it.For the most part the unit is fast, efficient and the interface is well thought out!"
1,manufacturer defects; insurance; warranty; bad business,"I have had my Treo 600 for over a year. It came with a manufacturers defect. I have insurance on my phone and a warranty with T-Mobile that will provide me with a refurbished phone. I have asked for a new phone; however, T-Mobile no longer carries the 600. I said well upgrade me to the one that you do carry. Neither the manufacturer nor T-mobile would upgrade me, even if I paid the difference in the cost. As far as I am concerned I have paid for a phone that I never received. I thought I was getting a new Treo 600 in perfection condition, and that is not what I got."
5,Amazing,It's the best gadget that i've ever bought! I was used to carry a cell phone and a palm and now i just care one simple thing.
2,Unreliable - I'm giving up,"After a year of owning this, I've had it and am scrapping it for a Blackberry. It's freezes, drops calls and has to be rebooted way too often for no apparent reason - like just switching from one function to another, or just answering a call.I'm very very disappointed.Buyers beware"
2,Bad Speaker Phone,"I took Palm One Treo 650 with Cingular 6 months back. I already exchanged 2 Treo's and now I am having the third piece.Features are good but, there are some of problems that have to be rectified.Reason for returning my 1st Treo 650: Speaker phone quality was too bad and after some time it was not working at all.Reason for returning my 2nd Treo 650: After using it for 3 months, Ringer Volume was totally dead. I had to keep the phone in vibration mode to recognize any in coming call. Speaker phone quality was also bad.Now I got the 3rd Treo 650 and close to the end of warranty period, i am really worried. Once I am out of warranty, I don't have any other option. I tried switching to other phone but, there is no option."
3,Palm Treo issues,"The shipping and product delivery from the seller was fine. The stability of the operating system in the unit however has been rather iffy. This is my 3rd Palm Treo, and love the units, but this one may have a bug in it. It rather routinely freezes up or randomly shuts down and resets on its own, losing whatever work I had. I'm trying to give it some time to see if there's a pattern, but my fear is that I may be sending this in for service or looking to spend another chunk of money on an all new unit. Not sure."
3,Treo 650,"When I first got my Treo 650 I was so excited. It was one of my first PDA phones. With all the cool little hacks and apps for it, I thought it would be so cool. The Treo does have all the good functions for a PDA or phone but sucks when you put it together. After about 2 months I started to experience the little glitches. Browsing was a pain. Also after a while whenever I had an incoming call it would sometimes shut off and restart. I don't know what was wrong with it but it got very annoying. Had this phone for about 6 months before I had to switch it up. Also it's a little bulky."
5,very positive,The palm treo that I purchased is a very handy piece of equipment that keeps me in touch even while on the go.The internet is something that is important to me and this phone has got it.I will recommend it.
2,"Good as PDA, bad as a phone","I bought a Treo 650 completely unlocked because I live outside US, first it was good, everything worked fine UNTIL I started using the phone for the first time. It's really painly to use, because keys are very tiny and it's very easy to press what you don't want, besides that, even when I was using anti-scratch films on the screen, it always was dirty because when you use the phone against your head to speak it gets dirty with marks of your ear.But as this wasn't completely painfull, the phone got locked once a week at least, sometimes I tried to make a call and it just didn't dialed until you turned it off and on again, like a soft reset, sometimes I was using an application and it just turned off and on again without hesitate or asking, I really NOT recommend buying this equipment nor Amazon or any other online or physical store."
1,MISLEADING!!!!,Not at all like what was in the description. DOES NOT WORK WITH VERIZON!!! Even though it says unlocked because it has a SIM card it will only work with certian carriers that still use archaic SIM cards! BUYERS BEWARE!
2,Not a very good phone,"I had this phone for less than a week and returned it. The PDA features worked great, but the phone did not measure up. The most annoying thing was the volume. I could barely hear calls outdoors (even with the volume turned all the way up). Additionally, if the camera is a feature you need, forget it! The resolution on this one is grainy and quite blurry. The colors appear washed out. I will say the phone has the best collection of ringers I have heard. I have heard that newer models are greatly improved, but i can't vouch for that."
1,"Worst phone, okay PDA","This is the worst phone I have ever owned. If you buy this phone, you will need to learn how to remove the battery, because I need to do it a few times a day to re-boot the system. The screen will freeze, drop calls, stop working in general, go directly to voicemail, just turn off the phone whenever it wants. The unfortunate thing is that it doesn't tell me when it shuts off, so I'm walking around thinking that it's on. I'm a doctor and this could be a disaster on emergency calls. I'm in the process of buying a phone to use for calls and just using this paperweight as a PDA. What a waste of 500 bucks."
2,buggy,"Loved the idea of moving back to a palm device after my sony p900 died. Constant lockups, requiring the removal of the battery to reboot even after doing a firmware update, made me return this to amazon. Will wait for the new sony."
1,Good PDA With Bad Phone,"I had a Treo 650 for a year and gave it up a few months ago for a Nokia 6682. The Treo has many faults. The most serious is that it periodically (every other day on average) resets during a phone call. It then takes an unacceptably long time to reboot. This is very fustrating when you are in the middle of an important phone call. In my experience even the cheapest category of cellphones do not reset like the Treo.Another serious fault is that the Treo sometimes crashes when running programs. Sometimes the crash results in the Treo going into an endless loop of resets that prevents the use of the phone. The remedy for this situation is complicated and not contained in the instruction manual.The Treo is also a little too deep, a little too wide and a little too heavy.I have also had problems with the battery overheating."
1,Avoid it!!!!,"This product is massively annoying. I was forced to purchase it as it was the ""company"" standard. Among the problems:The keyboard is too small resulting in many misdialed numbers and mistyped entries.The side buttons for controlling the volume are far too easy to accidentally push resulting in constant adjustment of phone and unit volume. (Why in the world aren't they locked out when the keyboard it locked out?)The accessories are the cheapest of cheap junk. The cables do not seat well in the product and the desktop cradle is a total waste of money and I've stopped using it all together because most of the time the unit will not connect to the laptop in the cradle without massive fiddling with the cable.I will never buy another Palm product again."
1,I never got it.,The seller says they did not get paid and Amazon say they paid them on the 15th of May and its the 31st. I asked to expedited it and I still have not gotten it. Ordering through Amazon has not been very good! This is the second time that I have had problems. It's been almost a month and I still don't have a Palm Piolet.
4,WiFi for Treo 650,There is a WiFi sled adaptor for the Treo 650 available at the Palm store web site for $149. It is called the Enfora Wi-Fi Sled for Treo 650. I found it under the what's new tab.http://store.palm.com/product/index.jsp?productId=1979188&cp;=1408079&clickid;=mainnav_whatsnew_txt&parentPage;=family
1,Beware of the TREO 650 latelly !!!,"I has been a PALM fan since the 90s ... just decided to buy a TREO. The 680 and its battery limitations suggest me to go with the 650 (out of production) ... This is going to be hard to believe but : I bought 5 (yes FIVE) TREO 650s, the first 4 were defective (keyboard problems, one came without camera !!!, another just freezes after it was turned o, and the last one didn't work with my fully functional GSM SIM Card) ... went to to TigerDirect in MIAMI, returned the last one, and changed for a unit that, so far, WORKS !!!!Palm should be ashame ..."
5,Truly Great Beginner Material,"This is the perfect DVD for someone who has never played the Violin or fiddle before. It teaches everything from holding the violin, to using the bow, to learning how to play your first songs. I found that after a month I was ready to move on to classical songs. It truly was a great and cheap way to learn."
3,Warning... only 14 pins,"This, like many cheaper VGA cords, does not have pin number 15. I didn't realized that before I got it, so I thought I'd mention it. It still works, but there is kind of a shadow on the screen... I'm not sure if it's the projector we're using or the missing pin, but just thought I'd mention it."
2,Only if you can stand the fortepiano,"Ok, I realize Beethoven wrote and performed these concertos on a fortepiano, but the power and majesty of the music requires a good old grand. Fortepiano sounds way too tinkly for Beethoven --sort of like a barrelhouse piano in the old west.This disc comes from the complete set of Beethoven concertos, which also has some very interesting bonuses, like a chamber verison of Symphony Number Two. However, that box set is out of print."
5,Underrated On Amazon,"This record really steams, it's amazing. ""jennifer"" is worth the purchase price alone.""got my eye on you"" is outstanding. this anton character is an amazingly underrated song writer! matt hollywood and joel gion also rule my universe. and the guitar riff in ""dawn"" might be the best sound ever made in music. you judge for yourself but really, really love this record. now it's on to ""take it from the man!"""
2,BORING ME TO TEARS,The first half of the album sound like Zappa making fun of Donavon. The second half sounds like songs that got rejected from early Stones albums. The music is dull and lifeless. It has no hook.
3,Ragged Glory,"Swirling together such influences as the Velvet Underground, the Rolling Stones, the Byrds, Bob Dylan, the Spacemen 3, the Monkees! and any number of groovy sixties garage bands with a pinch (lyrically) of Charlie Manson?!, ""Strung Out In Heaven"" is one of the Brian Jonestown Massacre's tastiest albums though not their best. Songs like ""Going To Hell"", ""Let's Pretend It's Summer"" and the country flavored ""Wasting Away"" are like diamonds in the rough. ""Jennifer"" and ""Lantern"" are particularly Byrds-jangly. ""Got My Eye On You"" and ""Nothing To Lose"" are pure Velvets. I love BJM but must admit that the album's charms weaken after the midway point. Maybe it's just the drugs..."
4,Get your Tambourine and Sing along,"Maximum Psychedelic Retro Overdriveatures with nice pitstops in goofy Flower era balladization. Some nuances of Van M's ""Them"" at times. Fun listening give it a shot."
1,Should have named this one Zero Inspiration,"Believe the bad reviews. I've listened to a couple of earlier cds by this band and felt, despite their influences doing it much better, they were still an okay listen. This cd, however, has about the most consistently uninspired ""melodies"" of any I've ever heard-- and trust me, it wasn't their intention. You can tell that with these tracks, they basically came up with some music and then tried to come up with the song melody for it, and coming up wayyyy short.Textbook examples of uninspired songwriting. Skip it.By the way, listening to it did inspire me, however. I've heard bad cds before, but this was the first to inspire me to take the time to sign up for a yahoo account and submit a bad review."
1,This band should quit!,"Own kind of music ha! Maybe if Spiritualized, The Rolling Stones and David Bowie were never born and that only the tip of the iceburg. This band sounds like they record everything on a 4 track and rip ALL their material off. Its boring and too much of a drone to even bother with. It actually makes my stomach turn. I think they should quit and try working at fast food or something."
1,Don't waste your money,People like this? A friend let me borrow his CD saying it was pretty cool but he was dead wrong I gave it right back to him the next day. I am very open minded to music but it must at least be half way descent....I give it the big thumbs down
5,Hits the Mark!,"Tolle as usually come across cold and witty with a keen understanding of the Mind, Soul, Body, and Spirit. This is a must read for those searching for asking to questions they may not fully understand about themselves."
1,Phantasmagoria,"Everything Tolle says is emotionalism taken to its most extreme. It's a good thing he discourages ""thinking"" and ""logic"" from the start, because his conclusions taken to any degree logically would cause his fans to dismiss him.If a woman ran her home utilizing his philosophy, she would sit on the couch watching him on Oprah, eating and meditating about how great it is that this is her purpose."
5,THIS is MUSIC at its BEST,"Rob Dougan has done it. He's crafted musical perfection, or close to it anyway. I have finally found the music I've been waiting for my whole life in this album - Rob D you are a genius. I think a lot of us wanted to know more about this guy as soon as we heard the track playing to the ""Woman in the Red Dress"" scene. Now I know why the Wachowski brothers have enlisted his musical talents to flesh out their movies.I know I should be trying to write a more helpful, objective review but I can do nothing but wax poetic for Rob Dougan and his debut album. He has mixed classical melodies with awesome electric beats and it all comes together in an audio orgy. Just buy the album already and let's get Rob some more mainstream recognition."
5,Haunting Poetry,Dougan manages to make me look at life in a different light. His haunting lyrics are more poetry than music. A genius? I believe so. Dougan's classical strings mingled with tencho/dance/electronica is unique and cool. I'll be listening to this CD for awhile to come.
5,Stunning vision that transcends established genres.,"It's hard to classify this into a specific category. A little electronica, a little pop, a whole lotta minimalistic string compositions. Whatever you want to call it, one thing is clear, this is a brilliant work of art that will undoubtedly be overlooked in America; it is ahead of it's time, released in a period where formulaic drivel rules the airwaves.The stars here are ""Clubbed to Death"" and ""Furious Angels"". These best show Dougan's masterful use of strings, showing his trademark minimalistic 4 chord set. It makes your spine tingle at it's raw, emotional intensity. It is dark, simple, and complex at the same time. More importanty, however, is that it is absolutely beautiful."
3,By the MP3s,"Clubbed to Death, There's Only Me and Nothing At All are quite good. The rest are movie soundtrack ripoffs, and self-consumed, cheesey Las Vegas lounge jobs. And it takes a bit to get past the bad Tom Waits imitation. But the 3 songs are pretty good. Buy the individual songs, save some money and feel ahead."
2,Uh,It was not at all what I thought it was going to be. I heard teh song from the Matrix soundtrack and thought this would me more of the same. Sadly mistaken.
5,To Call It Epic Would Be An Understatement,"This album is perhaps one of the most listened albums in my house. This album has completely opened my eyes to the world of music. On the first few listens, I didn't think much of it, other than Clubbed To Death. But soon after, I began to listen and love every single song, especially ""Drinking Song"". Nothing puts my mind to ease more than it. It simply is a work of art, a beautiful craft of melodies. It has changed my life and the way I see things.I await eagerly to see Dougan's future works.Signed, Dougan's #1 fan."
5,Awesomeness on a disk!,"When I first heard of Rob Dougan, I had only listened to Clubbed to Death and Furious Angels (Instrumental). After I got the whole CD, I was shocked that he had vocals. At first, like almost every other person that wrote a review, I was a little unsure if I liked it. But after a little time, I got accustomed to it and loved it. Unlike other CDs that are full of catchy songs that you like from the get-go and only listen to them for a week, this CD will keep your ears happy for a long time."
5,How did I jusf find this!!! INCREDIBLE,"Rob Dougan?Why was I not even familiar with the name. I know that there are many artists out there in today's exploding internet/world arena who I am unaware of either fortunately or unfortunately. However, when I run across an album that transcends so many genres, is immediately accesible, and has extrodinary lyrics, production, style, and arranging, I am left scratching my head.What is Rob Dougan's up too lately?If this is a one album wonder, let it remain that but it is a shame!!First of all heads up to all Peter Gabriel, Sarah Brightman, Snow Patrol, Seal, etc fans. THIS IS A MUST OWN. I have not heard anything in the last 5 years that has lept off of the disc into my musical soul. No repeated listens needed here for it to grow on you. I choose not to wordsmith a song by song review because this album gives the listener ample room to create their own mind-vid and picture/soundscapes.Be Assured! You will not be disappointed.Get it NOW!!!"
4,Terrific Instrumentals,The Matrix soundtrack introduced to Rob Dougan. I was drawn to the instrumentals rather than the songs with lyrics. Buy it for the instrumentals.
3,"Half Classic Rob Dougan, Half Garbage","As an avid fan of Rob Dougan, this album was a long time coming. I was a little disappointed though. His classic tracks are as fabulous as ever ('Clubbed to Death,' 'Furious Angels'). 'I'm Not Driving Anymore' (originally from the 'Driven' Soundtrack) is of the same orchestral/heavy beat quality. These three tracks together are so brilliant they give me goose bumps everytime I hear them. 'There's Only Me', 'Nothing at All' and 'Born Yesterday' are still in the right spirit. But the rest of the album disappoints. It includes a few uninspired movie-score sounding instrumentals ('Will You Follow Me,' 'Instrumental') and one incredibly horrible wannabe U2/Las Vegas showtune 'One and the Same.' Half the album is incredible; the other seems like it was written quickly and thrown in to round out the number of tracks. The album is worth it for the incredible parts alone; just try to ignore the rest."
5,The best,"Wow!! Powerful stuff. The music is so emotional and theatrical, full of life. The songs are wonderfully written, although the subject matter is dark, but that is what makes it so great. Rob Dougan is genius. I wish he had more stuff out there."
4,The Big Lie: A Review,"The Big Lie, by Isabella Leitner is a true story of the author's personal experience of the Holocaust. The novel took place during the Nazi occupation of Hungary in 1944. She and her family were deported to Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. World War II tore the family apart.We read the book in two days and considered it well worth our time. We know some think this book is too dark for children, but it really wasn't. It explained the truth of what happened. If we are going to prevent this ever happening again, people should know the truth."
2,Not as expected,"I've heard of this twosome for years, heralded as the epitome of jazz standards performed with sophistication. But, I'd never heard them until I bought this CD.My take? I'm not impressed with Jackie Cain's voice. Perhaps, it's partly due to the need to attenuate it at times, which, I've noticed, is what many female singers do to keep their voice from being overbearing. But, when Jackie lets hers have full vent, there is also something in the quality of it that I don't like."
5,valiente,"libro escrito por un sicologo que fue alcoholico y logro mantener 33 anos de sobriedad hasta que murio en el ano 2001. su confesion es una muy valiente considerando que fue sicologo clinico y por anos trabajo con pacientes bipolares, esquizofrenicos y alcoholicos igual que el."
2,Compendium,"This tome might be more accurately titled or described as a Biographical Compendium, not a Dictionary. It compares favorably with Webster's New Biographical Dictionary in that it contains more entries and is more current but compares unfavorably in that it does not contain the diacritical annotation required for the proper pronunciation of any of the entries. If you need a reference tool for speech writing, oral presentations, or the like, this Dictionary will not work out for you. If you need a reference tool that provides mini-bios, this will do."
2,Not what I had hoped.,"I was looking for a peaceful, enlightening, helpful pregnancy book...some spirituality for the ""pregnancy soul,"" if you wish...something to calm my nerves as a first-time mom, and center me. Unfortunately, all I found were more ways to worry about how I was already negatively affecting my baby. I was already busy worrying about my baby's well-being in the womb, and trying to ensure that he developed properly and was healthy. This just made me more of a head case. I think it's important to be positive, nurturing, and spiritual, but it's equally important to forgive yourself when you imperfections, or have a human, negative thought, or if you see some violent story on the news. Personally, I found it very disappointing."
2,Meh.,"If your idea of a spiritual book is one that tells you your fetus has direct access to your actual thoughts, and you should be careful about what you even SEE during pregnancy because it will have a DIRECT EFFECT on your growing baby, then THIS is the book for you!!! Honestly, it reads like a newer-age take on What to Expect - a lot of subtext about all the harm you're doing by seeing non-beautiful images (and heaven forbid you're a fan of scary movies, don't you dare think about seeing one because you'll scare that kid senseless!) It's not what I was hoping for."
5,WOW.,I am so glad that I got this audio book on a whim. The man's voice is soothing and calming. The advise is so awesome and has already helped me with dealing with everyday stresses better and now knowing how important that is for my developing baby. I am having my husband listen to this audio book next. It really has some great information and guidance in it as well as well produced studies and facts about fetal developement. Highly reccomend this book!!!
5,Fantastic!,This is a fabulous book. I have given it to every pregnant friend and they all love it. It clearly explains all of the little things you can do during pregnancy to minimize stress on the baby. And much much more. Buy it - it's wonderful.
4,I love this book,"This book takes you on a journey to the spiritual side of pregnancy and childbirth. For my second pregnancy the last thing I needed was another book telling me what stage of development my fetus was at. This book takes a look at all the deeper emotional things that are going on.I recommend this book for everyone, especially second time moms that had a bad experience the first time. It's been pretty helpful for me, facing my fears and helping to make my own informed decisions about my pregnancy and the birth of my baby."
3,"Loved intro, book was so-so","The introduction I read was amazing and was the reason I purchased the book. But after reading it I was a bit disappointed it seemed to lack the ""magical"" aspect I was looking forward to. Pretty basic info for a healthy pregnancy none the less."
2,Money Clip flimsy,"Size is great, but the money clip is flimsy. Don't trust it to be secure enough to hold bills."
3,Time to try something else,"I've owned two of these so far, and the lifespan of these wallets is just not long enough to justify a 3rd purchase. I've always loved the style and size of this wallet; it's very functional and holds quite a bit.Unfortunately, the money clip always loosens after about a year of use. Also, under the money clip is a rubberized pad to provide friction to keep the bills from slipping out. Well, this rubber pad tends to lose its adhesive ability after about a year, and falls right off.It's a shame that there isn't a bit more quality put into these wallets as I do love the form factor.Update: Purchased the Bosca Nappa wallet as a replacement, and I have to say it's sooooo much better.Bosca Nappa Vitello Deluxe Front Pocket Wallet"
4,Great Wallet,"I like that it is nice and thin and very well designed. The only real down fall is that the clip hardware makes it difficult to slide cards back in to the front card slot, this is not do tot the tension of the clip but rather the metal place that keeps the clip secure.All in all - I would purchase again, it looks great and I just leave NFC cards in that front pocket so I dont have to worry about removing them."
3,"Money clip does not hold/snap closed, just falls open","I liked the overall build of this wallet, but the money clip was disappointed and is pretty useless. It does not clip/stick closed and just ""swings"" open depending on orientation."
5,Dopp wallet,Excellent. Second one I have owned. Last long and is small enough for front pocket. Money clip works wellOk ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok
3,Nice but clasp keeps breaking,"I've bought two of these sofar. This is a nice, convenient way to carry credit cards, money etc. but i guess you can't put too much in it because the clasp has broken with both of them. At least it wasn't expensive. By broken, i mean that the clasp is now loose. It won't clamp down on my pants pocket anymore. Hope this helps."
4,A great Buy,Should have bought this a long time ago. It made me size down on what I carry in my wallet and that is a good thing. Fits great in the front pocket.
4,DOPP ID Money Clip,"Great size, great versatility. Fits easily in front pocket, holds right amount of cards with ""secret"" pockets to add more things - but, remember, you're buying this for compactness, not to hold too much stuff. The only con is that a magnetic money clip would have been better, but the clip hold just fine as it is."
3,Fun for a while...,"I enjoy racing games, generally, but Lego Racers 2 just doesn't do it for me. The 'story' game kept me busy for a while, though having finished the story, I wouldn't go back to complete it again. Otherwise, the individual races are fun, and the bonus games are challenging.The graphics are quite good, although the sounds aren't anything special. The music really gets on my nerves, but fortunately there's a way to silence it.I'd recommend Lego Racers 2 for occasional play, but it certainly hasn't captured my imagination."
5,A bit of nursing energy,I am a registered nurse and work 12 hours a day. I recently started purchasing the enduroshots for an extra boost for those long work days. In the middle of the afternoon during a short break I have my little shot and it gives me the energy I need to finish my shifts. Not only does it keep me going but the taste is fantastic. I would highly recommend this for anyone working as many hours as I do and being a nurse its nice to find a beverage that has all the health benefits that this one does.
4,"Trance you cab dance to, YEY !!!",I am an avid collector of trance music because I love going to clubs and listening to this kind of music. I must say this collection is unique and experiments a lot with vocals and fast rythms. I think you will find a few precious never before heard gems in this one. I highly reccomend it !
5,Viking Maid,"This is a super movie. Its about a sustainable lifestyle. Its about a group of young men, working as a team, bringing in the fish. I highly recommend this movie. It is inspiring."
3,Viking Maid,the fun thing about this movie is that I use to babysit for the producer and his brothers! But it was well put together and informative. The only thing is that there was some language that wasn't appropriate for young kids. One of my friend's wanted to show it to her 5th grade class and couldn't because of the language--which was too bad because it was pretty educational and a good film for the kids to see just how hard it is to be a commercial fisherman in Alaska. Anyway--I would recommend this to anyone interested in the fishing industry in Alaska and a brief history of Ketchikan.
4,There is no orchestra like WP,"Wiener Philarmoniker , or Vienna Philarmonic, is a truly wonderful orchestra. The crispy brass section, the sunny woodwinds, the noble string sonority ... a class in itself. Even with average conducting, one has to praise the level and sound the orchestra usually achieves in this repertoire. These Brahms pieces are part of its core, basic repertoire. In the piano concerto Pollini shows a truly great command of the keyboard together with a certain ""objectivity"" in his touch coupled with power and sensitivity when needed. The orchestra, I like most under Abbado. Bohm makes WP sound with majesty but sometimes underpowered. Balances under Bohm are focused on strings rather than winds, but I think that is a part of a ""pre-historically informed practices"" age. Strongly recommended unless you have a particular favourite of yours."
4,Very good performance of the 1st Concerto,"Poliziani and Bohm show that you don't have to smooth out the very dramatic and, to this listener at least, fascinating moods swings of the music in order to maintain it's continuity and coherence.The other performances are good too, but in the Haydn Variations I prefer the Szell-Cleveland Orchestra rendition available in Sony's Essential Classics series."
5,Fantastic!,"I have used this book to teach both of my children to read, and it has been easy and fun. I am using it now for my daughter and she is always asking to do some more pages. Bev's method is great and kids can read simple words rather quickly."
5,The Mystery of the Pirate Ghost,I have such great memories reading this book when I was a kid and now I get to share this with my little ones. The book arrived in great condition and without having to wait a long time for it. Great buy to go along with great memories!!!!!
4,Good story.,"My 4-year old daughter liked this book when we read it the first time, but she never asked to read it again. It's not a bad book, but it never captivated my children."
4,Good inexpensive cutter,"The steel Delta glue joint cutter worked fine for my job. I did not want to buy a fancy (and expensive), carbide-tipped cutter because I did not expect to be using it on a regular basis."
4,Super Spy Bart Gould is a winner!,"This is a great tongue-in-cheek thriller more along the lines of Jason King than James Bond. I'm not sure why Bartholomew Gould isn't more popular, or better known. The character is likeable, the action plentiful, and it's written with a nice dry wit. I look forward to reading the others in this series (if I can hunt them all down).In the book ""Bullets Over Hollywood"" John McCarty reveals that Joseph Hilton Smyth was the author of ""I, Mobster"", as well as ""Angels in the Gutter"" and ""The Sex Probers"". He also penned the first Bart Gould spy thriller (""President's Agent"") and, when I consulted the LoC Copyright Office records, I found that Smyth wrote this book as well, (""Baron Sinister""). Of the others in the series, Harold Calin was the author of ""Assignment: Assassination"" (#2), ""Worldbreaker"" (#3) w/Anne Calin, and ""The Man Who Bombed the World"" (#6). Don Rico wrote ""The Big Blue Death"" (#4). I don't know about #7 or #8."
2,Looks good but bad design,"Sturdy, well made, easy to clean. However, there is not enough support for ribs from the end and top braces. The ribs will sag, cutting off the air flow for dry roasting. Have tried tying them to the top bar (messy and awkward), but the best solution is to provide additional support behind each rib from the top bar to the bottom of the rack or a supporting pan.Recommendation: Look for a design that actually supports a rack of ribs."
5,Great service!,This is a very hard to find item. I ordered it and received it within a few days. I'm very pleased with the product as well as the speed of delivery. It came several days before the expected delivery date.
4,There is a better recording out there somewhere,"Antonin Dvorak's ""Stabat Mater Dolorosa"" is a wonderful piece of music, but I can't for the life of me find the full recording I want. This one sure ain't it. Pick up the soundtrack (or rent the film) of ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt"" to hear the wonderful Czech recording (snippets only), and you'll hear that it is superior. But this disc I'm reviewing is a real bargain for its sheer volume. Over two hours of Dvorak priced as one disc! Can't beat that with a stick!"
1,Not happy.,"Shoes are made in China and look and feel cheap. Way overpriced. Ordered my correct size, and yet my left lower leg and foot were hurting with these. Shoes scratched at the back of my right foot. The only difference between these overpriced shoes and some $35 Drugstore pair are that the heels are more elevated in these. Depending on the type of arch one has it may or may not be comfortable to someone. My EasySpirits are better than these. Will not purchase again."
3,Simple black coat.,"The material on this item seems a bit cheap but overall the coat is fine for a casual walk around downtown on a windy night. Can't really complain, for the price I suppose you can say the quality is about right."
2,not good,The reason I made this purchase was that my friend has a coat with similar design. However the quality of this one is much worse that my friend's. Not recommend it.
4,Kaplan on Bridge,"I have been searching for a bridge book that emphasizes the fundamentals and makes sense. This book fits the bill nicely. It not only explains bidding in a logical fashion but gives a sensible thought process on playing the game. I recommend it for the beginning or medium skill player. It has helped me a lot, having taken up the game again after a hiatus of some thirty years."
4,A complete course in contract bridge,"""A classic of the first magnitude."" Includes a basic course and an advanced section."
4,Pretty good,"I bought this for my husband after being recommended by my sister-in-law. We like it, and it's good to have a new scent, but it is not as good as Aqua D'Gio in our opinions."
2,A Rather Dry Account,"I have read a good number of fine books on the Civil War, however, this is not one of them. The accounts are indeed detailed as noted by other reviewers, but the story never comes alive. I confess to not reading all of this book, putting it down at page 110 to find something with real narrative power."
4,Good for Abbado,"A great performance by Abbado and the orchestra, even though the sound of the recording is not as good as the performance, except for Pétroushka. Still, I recomend this CD if you are interested in Stravinsky"
2,A little too open,Grill basket comes as advertised and the handles are easy to use and do lock in the two basket pieces so they do not open when you are flipping the food. One issue I had was that the vegetables I tried to grill were falling out the grid opennings. Things like mushrooms and onion slices would shrink as they cooked and with every flip of the basket I had to pick pieces of veggie off the grill. I had expected a smaller grid openning. I have a charbroil gas grill on a fixed post in my yard and the grill surface was not big enough to hold this basket unless I turned the basket 90 degrees placing the handle area over the fire making reattachment a little tricky to turn the food.
5,Best barbeque gizmo ever,"For a long time, I've tried to use a grilling basket for fish. The one I had did make turning the fish easy, but the long handle prevented completely closing the lid. When I did close the lid, it rested on the basket handle, lifting the fish off the grill and keeping it away from the heat. It was also a pain to clean. I bought this product because it would allow me to remove the handles and close the lid completely. The result is that the fish gets nicely seared and tastes delicious. When the handles are removed, the two basket pieces fit into the dishwasher, making cleaning a breeze. I love it for fish, and can't wait to try it for other things."
3,Don't believe the measurements they give you,"I have a 10 foot PlayNation SuperSlide. The product description says that an 8 foot cover fits 8 foot slides and the PlayNation 10 foot slide. It doesn't. It's WAY too short. If you decide to buy this cover, get the length that matches the length of your PlayNation slide, i.e. 10 foot slides should have the 10 foot cover, 12 foot slides have the 12 foot cover.Also, they ship the cover in the manufacturer's display box without an exterior box. This means that the box is easily damaged in shipping, and can result in a damaged cover or parts can be missing. When my cover arrived, the package was badly damaged with a large rip extending almost the entire distance around the box. I was lucky, though, because the cover and parts were intact with minimal damage. Keep in mind that you may not be so lucky, unless they change their shipping processes."
5,Must Have,"This album is fantastic -- the rare CD on which every single song is great. The track listing on Amazon leaves one song out (""On My Own"") indicates you can only get it on the collectible version -- not true, and thankfully so, because it's absence from the CD would definitely be a shame. Highly recommended for anyone who has just been longing to hear really good rock music, with lyrics you can understand, highly skilled musicians and a singer with an amazing voice. FIVE STARS!!!"
2,WEAK!!,"I tried to like this CD, but everything about it is just so below average and boring I just couldn't. Even the over the top production work of Keith Olsen can't save the sub-par material and less-than-spectacular performances from drowning in the cold sea of mediocrity. I say PASS."
4,Chuck Berry at his best.,"To view this movie, one must be a fan of rock and roll in general. Chuck is a feisty rock and roller, and he shows it. Keith Richards of Rolling Stones fame helped in the music direction of this doc. and is a huge fan of the subject. However, Keith bumps heads and fists with Mr. Berry, which adds to the fun and tension of the film. The music is awesome and always historic in it's presentation, you have a line up of musician's that are of course legendary. I recommend this movie for music fans of all genres because you get it all, and a bit of emotion at the same time. Chuck knows how he likes things and he gets his way...in the end. Great man, great music and great movie."
3,Definitely not the first nor last review book you'll need.,"No, this isn't the best review book. Too many errors and Coriolis makes it relatively difficult to get to the Errata page in their web site."
1,Lousy,I returned mine to get a refund. I have never done that before with a book - and I have bought many lousy books. I will not get fooled by Coriolis again!!
4,Very Good.,"This book was all I needed to pass the TCP/IP exam. If you've got some background, this may be all you need. It covers all of the material, even on the new adaptive version of the exam, although it's not quite up to date on testing info (i.e. what to expect on the adaptive exam). Questions are very helpful, and the text holds your interest."
3,Not as good as other Exam Cram Books,"I did just pass this test, but with little help from this book. The best thing about it is its size(small). This book is not nearly as good as the CORE exam cram books. It seems like they rushed this one to print. Some good chapters but the practice test is nothing like the real thing. Also, many of the chapters seemed to be ""thrown"" together - not well organized or explanatory like the other books in this series. I would go with the Official Training guide - pricey but right on. Use this to supplement."
4,"Overall, good exam preparation tool","The book is good even though there are some problems (like subnetting: I thought I knew it out cold, but it took me a while just to understand what the authors of the book were getting at). Overall, it's well written to prepare for the exam. I'm on my last exam now, I've passed the first 5 on the first try, and using Exam Cram books was certainly a big help."
5,I passed my test using this book!,"I want to say that I found this book to be extremely helpful. My knowledge going into this was at a very minimum, at best. I bought the book on a Saturday afternoon, took the test Tuesday and passed. It's organized so well. The sample questions are right on with those on the actual MCSE exams. What I like most was it's layout, easy to read. No big lengthy explanations that you get lost in the words over. To the point. Also, they not only explain why the answer is right, but why the wrong ones aren't right. Very helpful! I just bought another one of their books. Wish I'd have known about them for the first 4 exams! Try it, you'll like it!"
2,Hated it!,"I bought this book strictly on recommendations written here. Even though I was warned not to, I bought the Sybex Test Success book also. Yes, Sybex had some errors. But Exam Cram's questions were nothing like the questions I got in the actual test. Sybex's were very close! And in the case where there were errors, I noticed it right away. My recommendation is to always use TWO different study guides. Usually one will fit your studying style better. Don't always go by what is in these reviews!!!"
4,"Good material, occasionally confusing","Exam Cram books are the best test prep books I have read so far. It is the first book I read on a subject and it usually gives a very good account of what you will see on the test. The questions are not easy and are thought provoking.There are times where the book will assume you have knowledge of something which can get a little confusing. Also a few of the questions on the sample tests are wrong, including questions they inlcuded on the online Adaptive Exam.Despite the few errors you will run into, the book is full of the information you will need to pass the exam."
4,Typical Exam Cram Overall,"I like Exam Cram. In fact, I like them a lot. But, I would not rely on them as the only study aid for an MCSE exam.The TCP/IP Exam Cram is a nice book. It presents most of the salient points for the MCSE exam in a nice compact manner. There are some errors, as with all of the MCSE books from all sources (except maybe Microsoft Press). But, once you get the concepts down enough to find the errors, you are generally ready for the exam.The biggest shortcoming of this book is the limited subnetting examples. There is a enough information, but presenting how to set up a subnetting table would have been far more useful to passing the MCSE exam.If you work with TCP/IP in an NT environment, this book and your experience should be enough to pass the exam. If you are going for a paper MCSE, it would be best to augment your education with further material."
4,A couple errors but I passed the test with it...,All the typographical errors but maybe one or two were corrected on a list on the publisher's Web site. This was the main study medium I used to pass the TCP/IP test. Having taken the 3.51 version of the exam I just needed the facts about the 4.0 version. I liked the writing style: clear and concise!
3,Only book to read before taking TCP/IP Exam??,A couple of the chapters are really sloppy. There're several information contained are for NT 3.5x only and it looks like they were copied from some where without verify if they still good for NT 4. It could be the only book you need to read before the exam if you don't care about those errors. Good luck!
4,A good overview of the test,"I took the test and passed w/ a 948. In addition to this book, I read the New Riders and MS Press titles. This book is definitely worth the read. But, by no means should it be the only thing you read before taking the test. A couple of the chapters are really sloppy, and there's some outright wrong information contained. This one is definitely not on par with the other Exam Cram books. But, as a final review, it is still the best thing available. I would recommend this book and the MS TCP/IP books, in addition to the Transcender tests to give a knockout blow to the exam."
5,A 9 yr. old,"This game is totally cheap (price wise) because you get one regular game and one bounus game... It is very educational and also is fun. This is a really, really great game!!!"
3,game is O.K.,"I bought this game for my 6 year old. She played it once and thought that it was ""O.K."". I don't believe that she's gone back to it yet"
5,The Perfect blend of Rock & World Music,"This album is unique in that it blends world music (Indian to be exact) with hard alternative rock in a way that I've never heard before.If your musical tastes vary as do mine - Filter blasting from your car on Monday morning and then Ravi Shankar gently wafting from your home stereo on Tuesday night...you owe it to yourself to check this out. From the first track on, you'll see how unique it really is."
1,...Maybe for pygmy deer...,"I purchased this netting approximately 1 year ago. Packaging and product description were pretty generic, looked pretty much like standard bulk netting that this company (and probably many others) repackages with their name on it. Anyhoo, my wife and I spent most of the growing season patching and repairing this ""quality netting"". I recommend that you spend the extra money and get higher quality woven nylon netting (similar to volleyball net), if you want to keep the deer out and spend your time in the garden and not fixing the fence. I am pretty sure this fence would keep out deer in about the 20-30 pound range, probably about the size of the deer indigenous to where this netting was manufactured. Save your money!"
5,Anne Sofie von Otter - Schubert,"Schubert's songs are always very beautiful ...Schubert's songs chosen by Anne Sofie von Otter are much more than this.If you don't know Anne Sofie von Otter, please don't have any hesitation.Buy this masterpiece !"
5,Never judge a CD by its cover,"I am told this CD was included in an online magazine's top 10 lousiest CD covers. I would urge anyone who loves great leider singing to venture beyond the (admittedly) drab cover.There is something about a truly great mezzo that is at the same time uplifting and calming. As in previous recordings von Otter's vocal agility and evenness of tone make for a truly beautiful sound. She communicates the text of these leider with calmness and intelligence. ""Standchen"" is but one exemple of this artist's ability to forge dynamic contrast, and ""Im Fruhling"" contains some delicious pianissimi.The disk owes much to the sensitive, colourful accompaniment of Bengt Forsberg, and to an excellent choice of material - it is a beautifully evenly-paced recital.Shame about the cover..."
5,Excellent results!,Purchased this for the boyfriend. The first thing he said is I bought him a quality trimmer. He uses it all the time and he says it does not nick or cut his bald head. He seems happy with it and I love the results.
1,Unsuccessful purchase,The machine does not cut the hair short enough and the motor is lack of necessary power. I have used it to clean the neck area and did not do the expected job. I wish I have not order it because I have waste my money and do not expect to use it anymore. I do not recommend this product to others.
2,OK book,"Very onesided book. Not exactly an open mind, but does present a different perspective. Writer seems to live in a more idealistic world."
4,Wrap your arms around a failed system,"A superb primer on the most pressing crisis most Americans know little about.Concise, eloquent, and chock-full of insightful info, ""Are Prison's Obsolete"" is a book that every concerned citizen should read."
1,Just theory,"While this book does raise a valid argument, its solution to the problem seems impossible. Angela Davis hates prison, she spend time in a prison after guns she purchases were used in a terrorist attack in a courtroom. (She was one of the first women on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted).This book is written by a black communist woman who believes that prisons are racist and sexist and that the only way to stop racism and sexism is through Socialism. She's been called a ""dangerous terrorist"" by Richard Nixon and was banned from teaching at University of Colorado by then-governor Reagan for being a communist radical(before she became a fugitive).This woman is a radical with a radical idea. As interesting as it may be, it is mostly crap."
5,BACK - UP PAD,"GREAT PAD, FLEXIBLE, DURABLE, HOOK & LOOP ADHESION PROPERTIES VERY STRONG. VERY GOOD VALUE FOR THE PRICE."
1,Poor,Rubbish! Gas spits and splutters. Hard to light or flares up. Will not accept a proper fill. One star for appearance.
4,Perfect Setting,"When you need a perfect setting, and the sound must fill the space with lightness and gentle energy, this is the disc. It is thought and conversation-conducive, without ponderance or demand."
4,Great Book DVD Combo,"I got this book a couple of days ago and have gotten a ton out of it. I have bought a few filmmaking books before, but this is the first one that actually shows you a real film (on DVD), and then dissects it piece by piece. And it really does dissect it--the detail it goes into is great, and may be overwhelming or too much unless you are looking to do a film. But it is great for me!By the way, I'm not new to the movie Radius. I bought the original 2 disk DVD when it came out last year, and thought it was great, especially for $60,000. I bought it because I read an ethusiastic review of it on the filmthreat web site. I think it's really oddd that a previous Amazon reviewer would say the movie is bad and give the book 1 star. That's really strange to me. I found RObert Rodgriguez' 10 Minute Film School very helpful too, but it hardly touches the usefulness of this book and movie for learining about filmmaking in the real world, in my opinion."
3,cheap,The pads are cheap and a lot of the wool padding started to come off when used. Its a use once and throw away product.
1,Requires Expensive Backing Plate,"This may or may not be a good product from a usage standpoint, but Amazon and no one else apparently makes it clear that the product is useless without a velcro backing plate that costs another $20. They even try to sell it as an add on to a polisher without the backing plate!!If you want to use this pad with your polisher and it does not have a velcro backing plate, you will need to buy one."
1,Requires Expensive Backing Plate,"This may or may not be a good product from a usage standpoint, but Amazon and no one else apparently makes it clear that the product is useless without a velcro backing plate that costs another $20.If you want to use this pad with your polisher and it does not have a velcro backing plate, you will need to buy one."
5,Works well,"Per recommendation, it use it to do the cutting stage of car polishing using Porter Cable 7424XP. It does its job well. My only complaint is that that small wool threads will be shredded and fell off. You need to clean up the garage after you are done polishing cars. I guess it is nature of wool. I use it for heavy duty job such as cars that do not get waxing/polishing for a long time like mine. After that I switching to foams."
3,Not sure about this,"It didn't really take material off, but the compound was hard to get off with anything. Fibers were flying around everywhere too. I suppose there is a good use for this, I just can't use it."
1,pad too small for a 7 inch backing plate?,"hello, noob here, bought a neiko hd 7 inch polisher and a meguiar's w4000 wool pad. upon assembly, i noticed that the wool will not sit properly on the velcro backing plate, so, i measured the diameter of both the wool pad and the polisher.the result is that the pad is 6 5/8"" while the backing plate is 7"", which explains why it wasn't sitting in flushed with the plate. my question is, do i spread the edge of the wool pad to make it fit to the plate? i've never done this before so i don't wanna destroy the pad. the seller, tcp global is giving me the round around on returning it, so if i can make it work, i 'll call it a day. any input shared is greatly appreciated.as for now, i'm giving it a 1 star review mainly for the seller. as soon as i get to use, i will update and change my review."
1,Exceptionally bad,"Pros:*Supported by the linux kernel*It did not catch on fire when I plugged it in.Cons:*captures 640x480 video at a very poor framerate*the CIF chip does not allow for resolution lowering, to increase the framerate*frames are oversaturated and require a lot of toying with settings, and are generally impossible to get looking remotely decent.*insanely expensive MSRP for the level of qualityOther thoughts:Avoid this if at all possible. I was able to buy mine for less than $10, so I can't really complain. I've been using it for home surveillance, and it does the job (albeit poorly). However, if you're considering paying *more* than $10 for this.. I'm certain you can find a much better deal investing almost anywhere else."
3,"VERY SIMPLE, STARTING WEBCAM","Very simple, I bought it in Walmart for 39.00.More expensive) it is very light and easy to knock down. It works with a lot of light, so if you are chating at night be sure that the room is well lighted.The picture is no very clear, and the colors either."
2,Not Great,"Let me start by saying that the video quality is passable. I've seen worse. However, I've also seen much better. And the audio is terrible. For $40 this should be a decent webcam. It's not. My cheap microphone has way better sound quality than this camera.Frankly, don't bother. You can find better cameras for much cheaper."
1,Not worth buying,"The only reason I have this was because it was given as a gift. On windows operating systems it works without problem. Just plug it in and it works. The reason I rated this so badly was because the quality was terrible and the mic does not pick up jack.In my opinion, any web cam rated below a three is not worth giving a two, and is not worth buying at all. You can buy decent web cams now days for really cheap. With the quality of this thing, it's just not worth using or buying unless it's given to you (maybe at best).MAC OSX COMPATIBILITY: I plugged this into my 2010 mac mini and it does not work at all. The os is just not able to see it. I looked for support/drivers on hp's web site but the only operating system that supports this web cam is windows. It might work with others as I have not tested any others, but I can tell you that it does not work on macs.Spend $20 or more on a web cam you will be happy with instead of throwing $10 to $15 away on this thing."
1,the worst,i paid close to 50.00 for this useless junk. the cam itself looked ok when using yahoo and inviting people to see my cam. but the mic was the worst couldn't hear bearly did sound like talking into a soup can. but now that yahoo has video calling the pic is even worse very blurry even after messing with the focus. does not stream at all. too late now wish i could take it back.
1,Awful,"I bought this because I heard some songs in a TV show however, this CD in not fun to listen to."
3,Let the buyer beware...,"Though this is a fine performance of the opera Gardiner's liberties with the text make it exemplary of all that is (historically) wrong with contemporary opera reconstruction and performance. First, Gardiner largely utilises the earliest text of the opera adding material from the revised version only if ""aesthetics"" dictate. Second, Gardiner disses the original dialogue (it doesn't meet the ""transcendental"" aesthetic criteria he relies on) and replaces it with a version written by a German actor of today...I suppose that if Gardiner got a hold of Huckleberry Finn he would jettison a couple of chapters and re-write Huck's monologues. God save us from such ahistorical reconstruction."
3,KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid),"When I bought this book I was expecting something deep and profound. At first I was a little disappointed and wondered where is the ""intellectual meat""? As I finished the book what I did find were simple explanations of basic truths I have personally experienced within married life. A few behavior scenarios written where any reader may see their actions in a new perspective and the control they have to make a positive change in their wellbeing as well as their lovers. One thought-provoking question was ""why wouldn't you treat your loved ones with the same decency, concern and manners you would a guest in your home or even a stranger you would meet."" The overall ""warning"" I got from this book was...""We"" took the masculinity out of men. It is time ""we"" put it back. If you are a woman wondering where all the men have gone this is a book for you. If you are a woman cheering the extinction of men I recommend you pass."
4,No Nonsense Sense,"Dr. Laura always shoots the straight goods & this book is no exception to her track record. She's not intending to solve all the world's problems, but she does speak directly to the heart of MANY problems our American families struggle with in today's culture. Proper Care is a practical, kick-butt, inspiring book that ANY woman would benefit from. It's also a great gift book!"
5,Women don't be shy. You will love this book!,"This was the best book I have ever read for my marriage. After reading it myself, my husband and I read it together. It did him a world of good too and has sparked many meaningful converations."
2,Amusing title but it ends there,"This book is a best an amusing joke. It is insulting to both men and women and fails to admit the vast differences between individuals. Furthermore if either partner agrees to have sex just to please the other (as she advises) it turns a beautiful act of love into somthing meaningless and dirty. I do not know of anyone in a happy relationship that has not figured out that sex is best when both partners are satisfied and a disapointment when only one person is ""in the mood"".Sure going out of one's way to make your husband feel extra special once in awhile is a good idea but to make it a cornerstone of a relationship is VERY bad advice. When reading this book I could only think of the people I know who did live their lives as advised in this book and how unhappy they were in real life."
1,Why not ZERO stars?,"This book operates on two basic premises:Men want a mommy/maid/prostitute who raises their children, cleans up after them, and puts out whenever he snaps his fingers. No relationship is necessary or even wanted.Women only want to spend money. So in order to acheive that goal, they should actively pursue the mommy/maid/prostitute role without complaint and they will get presents.In Dr. Laura's world, husbands and wives are (at best) not friends but co-workers; and (at worst) parasites manipulating each other for personal happiness. According to Dr. Laura no communication should take place between the husband and wife, and if communication HAS to take place then it should be the husband communicating to the wife what he wants/needs. There is no room in Dr. Laura's worldview for people who are interested in maintaining an equal partnership."
1,proper care and feeding of husbands,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!One of the Most useless time productions, without any kind of Intelligent reserch. Full of Rambleling. One Sided attempt of""cure-Alls"" which offerNO worthwile info. There are Better Book for Carinmg for your Cat or Other Animals, at Title Implyes!Highly reccommended for Door Stops, Wasted Material. as Title Implies."
3,Good for thumbing through,"Good insight into how men look at things differently than women, there are some good ideas but after a few chapters it becomes a bit repetitive"
5,Loved It,"Very educational book and some funny stuff as well. I think it only took me 2 nights to read this, I could not put it down."
3,It's ok,"It's ok, nothing I didn't already know. Passing it on to a younger woman who needs it! Worked for others."
3,A little disappointed,Can't get all the way through this one. Not what I expected. Dr. Laura has a tendency to generalize every situation. Doesn't take into consideration variables in each caller's situation.
1,Not impressed,I was hoping this book would have some more info for those of us that are 2 income households. This book is geared to a 1 income household.
3,not bad- but Barbara De Angelis is better,"First of all, she is militant about her ideas. Really militant. maybe she thinks she has to be. I'm not sure one needs to be militant in relationships. Barbara De Angelis approaches the same subject more softly, and evenly, I think. Dr Laura is very ""in your face"", at times."
3,"abridged version of ""Proper Feeding of Husbands.""",This was less than i expected probably because it was an abridged version. The only topic covered was sex.
1,Truth for living,"This book confirmed my own belief on how a woman should care for her man, and in return he will meet all her needs. What could be more of a truth on giving then real life experiences. I highly recommend this book for all those who want a meaningful life."
4,The help I needed!,This book is great! It's a good reminder to not take your husband for granted and that his intentions are generally good.
2,Disappointing for me.,"I listen to Dr. Laura every work day, and I very often am blown away by her uncanny ability to pin-point the problem and present a very good solution. However, my description of this book would be that it is a disorganized collection of rants about how women do everything wrong. Each chapter is filled with conversations with women and men that belabor this point. The majority of these conversations are belittling and paint the woman a selfish fool. All the conversations with men are sympathetic to the tragedy that their wife doesn't do this or that for them.I was hoping for a cute and insightful step-by-step ""manual"", but what I got was completely the opposite."
4,very helpful,"This book really hits the nail on the head- We women need to try harder to understand our husbands. This by no means means that they are perfect or never to blame, but we need to try a little harder. Dr. Laura is honest and direct and gives very helpful advice. I would recommend this book to anyone who is married, regardless of how long! We can all use a little help."
4,Helpful insights,"The author is great and has a lot of good insights into taking care of husbands, but she quotes so much from her radio show which I already listen to everyday, so there wasnt a lot of new information. Still - it's a good book and worth reading."
3,The Proper Care & Feeding of Husbands,"I am familiar with Dr. Laura Schlessinger's work, so I knew it would be on the conservative side...and it was. However, some of it was very practical as well. A lot of the advice could just as well be applied to husbands caring for and ""feeding"" their wives. While I do believe that men and women think totally differently, I think that there has to be a balance and a mutual respect for those differences."
1,"If you're not a Dr. Laura fan, don't buy this tape.","I thought I could overlook Dr. Laura's irritating voice and condescending manner in order to get through this tape, but alas, I was wrong. She makes a few good points, but they get lost in her sarcastic and demeaning delivery. The title should be a clue that she thinks men are ""pets"" and if you go to the right obedience class (hers), you'll be fine. Her one-size-fits-all advice works only if you're married to a dog or cat. She brags in the beginning about solicitating ""donations"" from listeners to produce this tape, and how they begged her to make it. Let's hope they're the only ones who wasted money on it."
1,Welcome to the Republic of Gilead,"Excellent primer on how women can nourish and nurture relationships by impoverishing themselves intellectually, emotionally and financially. While the upkeep may strain their seemingly infinite capabilities to the extreme, like an obedient pet, they may expect to be taken care of; the only caveat being that they be prepared and willing to relinquish their self-respect along the way."
1,Don't buy this woman bashing book!!!!!,"This book is so horrible, Laura Schlessinger (Author) must have some built up anger agianst women. If you have any self respect as a woman DO NOT buy this book!!! Just to give you an idea of how bad it is here is a quote from the book"" remember without him you are a sorry excuse for a person "" and that's only in the introduction. In my opinion if you really want to make your husband happy, be happy with yourself. This book just basically tells you to forget about your self and do everything a man says because he's always right. I suggest more of a self help book, than an obey from your master book."
2,Dr. Laura run amuck,"Laura's thoughts and comments are from some sort of fantasy existance. The basic concept of treating your mate as your friend and all of the things that go with that could have been simply said without all of the denegration of women. The whiny, overly simplfied male ego presented is a huge exaggeration to the male ego of 2004. More guilt and expectations on women is a less than helpful approach to helping troubled relationships. This book is frustrating and futile, while the basic premise was well intended, the book was very poorly executed. Listening to Laura's daily self-serving commentary is troubling, less than truthful, and consistently negates women. Not a book I'll be keeping on my bookshelf."
1,Demeaning to both men and women,"Wow, I have two friends that swear by this book, and both are in troubled marriages. I finally gave in and even bought the dumb book, and I regret it. I want a refund.Why not just be honest in your marriage? Its worked for me for almost two decades. When I say honest, I mean honest without being a jerk or argumentative. Isn't that common sense?The whole book is full of women manipulating men into getting what they want because women are the brains behind the relationship, and men are too dumb to figure out what the women are doing, so they will go along with anything the woman says as long as she says and does the right things.I completely disagree with manipulation in any form, especially in marriage. If you use Dr. Laura's advice and pretend when you ""don't feel like it"", because it will get you what you want, beware! My husband loaths this tactic as do I. Maybe we're just different."
5,A must read for those that desire a long and happy marriage,"Dr. Laura's advice and strategies actually empower women and strengthen families hopefully resulting in fewer divorces and children growing up in harmonious homes. I dare the skeptics and critics of this book (that actually read it) to ponder your own attitudes and alter your behavior for just one week. I guarantee you'll be amazed at the warmth, closeness and mutual respect you receive from your husband. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand the male beast a little better...and improve the communication in your marriage. You will certainly reignite the flame that has gone a bit dim."
5,A must read!,"In my opinion, this book is a ""must read"" for any one looking at getting married, male or female. Any married woman that is feeling ""not quite satisfied"" in her marriage would do well to give this book a try. If I were a man, I would buy a copy for my wife and encourage her to read it, maybe even read it together. A lot of good information. Save the money on the marriage counselor, buy this book and act on it!"
3,"Great Advice, Poor Presentation","Dr. Laura's advice to be respectful and tolerant of our men is valuable so I gave it three stars, but it is difficult to hear when offered so disrespectfully. Instead, I recommend ""For Women Only, Revised and Updated Edition: What You Need to Know About the Inner Lives of Men,"" by Shaunti Feldhahn. She delivers the same message but in a respectful, warm manner. Both books present the same valuable message but Feldhahn's style feels like a good chat with a girlfriend instead of a demeaning lecture."
1,Could have been written in the 1950s,"No worth a penny. Thank goodness I borrowed this book from the library. ""A husband is like a horse. At the end of the day he is usually rode hard and put away sweaty.."" this is the authors rationalization behind why women should ""serve"" their men at home and forgive their men any shortcomings. That is the premise of the entire book. Fine for women living in the 1950s, but the current state of our economy requires both husband and wife bring home the bacon. I do believe that your husband deserves your respect, understanding and kindness, but not because he is supporting you financially."
4,The Proper Care and Feeding of HUNGRY Husbands,"This book isn't going to wow some... and at times, I was scratching my head, saying REALLY? But bottom line... there is very valid advice in each aspect of how to treat your husband and some of it is so common sense but really needs to be said. When you put your all into your marriage and follow some of this advice, you would be amazed at how much the environment in your home can change."
4,The title,It's an unfortunate title because it'll ultimately turn some readers off and those are likely the readers that need it most.. I really liked the book and found it super valuable.
5,Great book,"Dr. Laura's full of wisdom. This book is awesome for any married couple, even if you don't have problems. Great book."
5,Great Read!,"I flipped through this book at a book store and it caught my attention immediately. I went home and bought it on my kindle because I knew I wanted to have the electronic version forever (yes that is dramatic! ha ha). The bottom line, this book earned my respect because it is filled with the voices of other people. It's not just the author spouting off her knowledge - it's jam packed with quotes from her conversations with men and women. Sure, not everyone will agree with her conclusions, but in my humble opinion, the advice she gives works :)"
3,A cared for and rather well fed husband's point of view.,"I don't think this book was meant to be a detailed or nuanced exploration of all the ways marriages can become dysfunctional. Rather, Dr. Laura illustrates, by using some rather extreme examples, how husbends can end up starved for what they need the most by their own wives.So, even though none of the examples in this book applied directly to my marriage situation (I guess I'm rather well fed), I can see Dr. Laura's point and I suppose there are many couples who could benefit by perhaps both the husband and wife reading this book and talking it over.My one dissapointment with this book is that so much of it is transcribed from phone calls to Dr. Laura's radio show. It's really a collection of phone calls sorted into categories with commentary by Dr. Laura. Think of it as a ""best of Dr. Laura's radio show"" in book form. That said, I'm glad she wrote it."
5,Dr Laura,"Amazon delivery was quick, the book is even better than I thought it would be. I was looking for a way to turn my mother's attitude around, and Dr. Laura has the courage to tell it like it is, I really took her words to heart."
5,easy businesses,Like to get a cheaper buy and recycle while doing it. will buy again great advice instead of paying for a councilor. Received pretty quickly
3,Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands,"Arrived even quicker than was said and in better condition than expected. Was an easy read. Lot's of information, a valuable tool for any one who deals with men on a regular basis. Will purchase from this vendor again."
2,Just listen to the radio show.,I listen to Dr Laura on the radio. I was disapointed in two of her books because they were mostly just her calls in printed form. Very little guidance from someone that has a lot of schooling of relationships.
1,Not every husband is that simpleton,"Men are not all the same. This book can help women who have a certain kind of men. I know men whose wives did all: cook favorite foods, looked scantily and sexy, did magnificent sex every night, and in the end these men were annoyed rather than happy, went to find variety or someone cooler and ""misterious"". And on the top called these ex-wives ""too emotional"", ""too clingy"", ""not serious enough"", ""not challenging enough"" etc.An advice for the women out there: ""Be true to yourself"". If he doesn't like, you are not made for each other, period. Get over and try to find someone who really loves you for who you are, instead of pretending to be someone you are not. And also forget about ""changing the guy later"" thought. I really believe in good matches, not in formulas."
2,Pluck out my eyes,"I rarely put down a book when I'm 2 or 3 chapters into it; maybe I'm just stubborn but I feel that I owe it to the author even just out of reverence for the dead trees. Well, I got in about 130 pages, just after all the exposition, the bad guys had entered, the plot had been set up and it was clear that the author was going to find every boring legal way to make it come out that the good guys would win, the good guys who didn't like each other would end up loving and respecting each other and the bad guys would be foiled.What a bore, the characters were stereotyped, drawn in crayon. The plot was intricate and well over-cooked and not a 3 dimensional person in the bunch. All that was missing - and maybe that came in after I put the book away - was a wise old Irish priest who said begorrah a lot and kept a bottle in his desk. Ugh."
3,Helpful but be careful!,"This book has a truly unbelievable number of grammatical errors, misplaced punctuation, etc. Read your work carefully before sending."
4,Good performance of a very tough work,"The lilting title of ""Spring Symphony"" is misleading--this is one of Britten's thorniest works, and for me very hard to like. Gardiner gives a good-enough performance, not quite up to Previn's on EMI, which has much better vocal soloists, and nowhere near the composer's own version, wich unfortunately comes in mono only."
5,a must for all Bernstein fans,I own the highly acclaimed recording by Georg Szell but never got into hi interpretation. I therefore purchased this bargain double-CD from DG.I have to say that I am a huge Bernstein fan and I was not disappointed. This recording has much more depth and also the sound is striking. In addition this is a liver recording and it therefore has much more tension than sterile studio recordings. A must for all Bernstein fans!
5,OUTSTANDING!!!!,"I have listened to these recordings for several years now. Each time I hear them I recall why I fell in love with Robert Schumann's music and why these performances are incredible. When one has a recording that combines superb conducting with superb performance by a symphony with superb engineering, something special happens. And it happens here. I use audiophile grade headphones for most of my listening along with audiophile grade amplifier and CD player. I never tire of listening to any of these symphonies. The second symphony is especially nice, especially the last movement. The price of these recordings is an absolute bargain. Most highly recommended if you enjoy romantic music played as it is meant to be heard and to be enjoyed."
1,Horrible,"First of all, I like Bernstein. He was one of those that will never be replaced.That said, these recordings are perhaps the worst recordings that I've ever heard on anything.The tempos are bad, the orchestra sounds muffled, it is just horrible. I waited and waited for an exciting moment, for something that I could have told myself ""ha, ha!"" But not. It was disappointment after disappointment. There is really NOTHING on this recording that is worth listening.I can't believe all these 5 stars...As for a reference, my favorite Schumann's symphonies recordings are Karajan (one of the few Karajan's recordings that aged well) and Masur with the LPO."
4,Bernstein Schumann Symphonies,"Excellent, usual superb conducting by Leonard Bernstein. Some passages are ""muddied"" - like analog recording. Overall - very nice listening."
5,The Best of the Arden3 editions,Jonathan Bate has done a brilliant job of editing this play. It is by far the finest of the Arden3 editions. The notes are excellent - not schlarly nonsense but helpful for the reader or actor. Highly recommended.
3,"good quality, bad idea","I have owned and bred cockatiels for thirteen years, and I have been using kaytee exact since I got my first bird. Cockatiels are intelligent and can be quite picky about what they eat. This is a great high quality bird diet, but my bird just refuse to eat certain colored pieces! They would eat all the green and yellow bits, and then throw the orange and red bits all over the room. It was a big waste because half the food ended up in the trash. I switched them to the natural; dye free formula and all the birds eat it all without a problem. Go with the dye free formula."
5,Back to her old stuff!!,"Laura has written a book that goes back to Black Rubber Dress with its style and mystery. It took me till the last 4 pages, where she tells you who did it, to figure it out. Once I knew who did it, the whole story feel into place. But, the story kept me on my toes the whole time.Sam has yet again stumbled into a murder. This time her best friend Tom has been accused. She spends her time in a small town outside of London debating her relationship with Hugo and trying to figure out who done it. This story is a fast mind-tickling read. I would recommend it to any mystery reader."
1,drag,"There aren't many simple laundry bags out there that have a shoulder strap. My old one finally bit the dust and I have no idea where it came from so I got this one. It's pretty lame. Yes, the fabric is good and sturdy but I have to agree with the other review, the strap is too long. Not just a little too long, I'm talking 2-3 feet too long and it's not adjustable. It totally defeats the purpose of having a laundry bag with a shoulder strap. Yes, grommets would be good and how about a plastic stopper so that the cinch remains cinched on the way to the laundromat? I'm changing this from a 2 star to a 1 star, it's a useless bag and it was a waste of money even at $6."
1,Very Disappointed,I am 43 years old and never left a review before. I ordered this watch as a Christmas gift and received it today without any type of paperwork and it doesn't work. with only 4 days till Christmas i have to come up with a plan B.
2,Wimpy Mahler :(,"The other two reviewers here give high praise to this recording. If its the only version of these two works you have heard I can understand why, but having heard numerous versions of these works both recorded and live I must say that these renditions are not at the level I am used to. One would think that with the Chicago Symphony at his disposal Abbado would let loose a little more, but instead of a blazing interpretation we get a rather tame, definetly non-Mahlerian piece of hash. Abbado never really lets the brass shine the way they could and the recording quality is sub-par for DG. As for the recording of the fourth symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic, I was even more dissapointed than with the Ressurection symphony. Very dull sounding and lacking a lot of character found in other renditions. All in all not an invalid interpretation of these two works, but you can certainly do A LOT better than this."
3,Pleasant,"Rancher Sam Evans wanted to leave Colorado and prove thathe can make it without his wealthy family's support. He didn'tplan to slip through time, but when he arrives in HeartbreakHill, Montana, he has also traveled from 1889 to 2001.Sheriff Taylor O'Brien has her hands full with aten-year-old son and her campaign for re-election. She does notwant to deal with a lunatic who claims to be from the past.However, she can't help but be charmed by this ""old-fashioned""gentleman.Sam's reactions to his new surroundings add a light touch.He is thoroughly likable and a great father-figure for Cody. Thefinal wrap-up of Taylor's and Sam's issues comes a little tootidily and quickly at the end, but the story itself is anengaging mix of modern issues and Old West values. With a villainyou'll love to hate and a hero you'd love to meet, this is astory to make you smile."
4,Fun beach ball,"This beach ball has been a lot of fun for my one and a half year old daughter. It is nice and light-weight, easy to inflate and deflate, and pretty durable. Fun for indoor or outdoor use. My daughter even watched me blow it up and then pretended to blow it up in the same spot when I was done! Pretty impressive. Have also used it to teach colors."
2,Ball deflates,"Ball deflates too often( they all do) but its cheap, honestly I would not get any of those balls as they deflate"
2,A Disappointing Sequal,"This book is a sequal to The Rainbow Goblins, a truly beautiful and imaginative book which my two-year-old adores. The White Goblin has beautiful illustrations, but there are double page spreads followed by pages of just text, which a child will not like. The White Goblin raises a host of Cave Goblins from the ground and they build big cities and destroy nature. Its message is important but a bit preachy for children. It's just not as good. Alas!"
5,A fest for the eyes for children of all ages,"I purchased a copy of this book (and its companion book, The Rainbow Goblins) back when they were first released. They/it were favorites with all of my children. They are now all grown up and the question of which of them would get physical custody of the family copies was headed to open conflict so I have managed to track down ""as new"" copies for all. Yeah! Thank you Amazon for saving this Christmas."
1,a load of me lefty!,"still read rainbow goblins over and over. that book is the reason i bought this one. just finished reading white goblin. never again. weak story, clumsy writing, baffling exit of a seemingly key character, doublespreads with no pictures, but worst of all..... hammers its eco-green message blunt towards the end before finishing with a lazy dollop of schmalz. Very disappointed.I'd like to apologise to my friend kieran for having him mind this crappy book for me for months on end, and also to my friend david who very kindly wasted valuable luggage space bringing this tripe home.Sorry guys"
4,Good book. Will serve a purpose,I use a Mac and had no trouble accessing the CD as others have indicated. I don't know how often I will use it in a Spanish classroom but it's good to have just in case. I really like being able to access the designs off the CD.
3,very enjoyable read,I've read all three of her books (to date) and enjoyed ever one of them. They grab you from page one and hold you till the last line!! I highly recommed them all.
5,Attention to detail and surprise turns of events,make this another success by Ms. Kelly. The portrayal of the evidence and the locale make it all credible. Laura and Amos are very human and lovable and the other characters believable. The twists and turns keep you guessing till the final chapter. Can't wait for the next one!
2,Windows-centric,"I would not recommend this book for anyone except Windows developers. One of the attractions of OpenGL is that it is cross platform. While not a bad book, as early as the second chapter it immediately focuses on WGL, which is a Win32 API that presents an interface to OpenGL itself -- if you're not a Windows programmer you'll get lost quickly as there is nothing for you here that you can actually type in and experiment with. I don't understand why they chose that path instead of simply presenting pure OpenGL, but being Windows-centric will make this book frustrating for anyone trying to learn OpenGL on a non-Windows platform."
4,Admitted buyers remorse,"There is nothing fundamentally wrong with this book. As a few of the other commenters have already pointed out, it's a window focused book. Had I actually done my research more thoroughly on my ubuntu box, I would have seen that and gone forGame Programming All in One, Third Editioninstead which is by the same author and uses the platform independent Allegro library. Again, nothing implicitly wrong with this book, just not necessarily for me."
1,Beginning? Yeah Right...,"This book is utterly useless for both a beginner like me, and someone who knows C++ well. All it does is explain what each function does rather than teaching you how to use it. In the 2nd chapter alone, there's a 200-line program of all OpenGL functions that you're expected to understand by about 3 pages of explanation. I'm a beginning programmer who knows a lot about C, but not everything, and this book isn't helping me at all. Also, I can tell that it doesn't teach you much, as the end of book game example is slow and buggy. Go learn C++ then get an online tutorial or reference page, don't waste the money on this book."
2,Terrible update on the original,"I had read the original book a lot and found it pretty good. I bought this based on that fact. Sorry to say I was not pleased.trying to texture from the info in this book is pretty useless, heres an example:""Assuming you already have your image data loaded into memory...""It doesnt tell you how to do this! It says how to create an openGL bitmap, but not an image like a windows bitmap. There is then like 3 pages on loading a TGA file but its too much of a weak introduction. Example: ""For space reasons, we are not going to show you the code for this class here (look on the CD!).I bought a book to read, the CD doesnt explain the rest of the class. There is a big difference in manipulating the code and understanding it.Summary: The older book is better and has more information."
4,READ PRODUCT DETAILS!,"Great product, just be careful when ordering. I didn't realize there was an All About Eyes and All About Eyes Rich. I'm accustomed to the Rich formula. When I received this I was very upset in the difference of this formula to the Rich formula. Still works, just a difference in the way it goes on and rubs in."
2,I didnt work for me,"I tried this clinique product for a while, but I was disappointment. It did not help me with any of my Wrinkles or dark circles.Do not waist your money :-("
3,Shoes,Took about 7 days to get shoes. The shoes fit but they quickly streched out and now are too large.
5,Most comfortable shoes,This is the 3rd or 4th pair of Merrell Jungle mocs I have purchased since 1998. They are by far the best shoe I have ever owned. They take me everywhere and hold up in every condition. This is my first pair in Gunsmoke. I usually have selected brown. Thank you also Shoemania for the fast shipping and easy transaction.
2,Shoe,"I usually love Merrell Jungle mocs however the pair I ordered are too wide, so they are not comfortable. Now I could have sent them back but chose to try to wear them. I remember now that the smoke colored ones fit differently than the brown ones it seems."
4,Very comfortable,"These shoes are SO comfortable. I work on cement floors at 2 jobs/day, one of which includes walking dogs. My jungle mocs have made it much easier to work all day with no cushion/support underfoot. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars. I had to knock it down because the toe tip of the sole on one of the shoes started coming unglued after the first day. Overall, though, I am very happy with them!"
5,My Jungle Mocs,"I love the shoes. I had to return the cordovan because they were too small. I reordered a 10 1/2 (which they had to my delight) and they came a week or so later and I'm happy each time I wear them.They're great for this time of the year, and I hope they never wear out."
5,Extremely Comfortable,"These may not be the most glamorous looking shoes, but they are very great for my feet. Since I am on my feet all day at work, I needed a shoe that would be comfortable for an 8 hour day. I think I have about 2 pairs now and may have to buy a third since I've worn my second pair out! Anyway, these are great shoes if you are on your feet all day or if you just want a comfortable shoe."
5,Jungle Moc Blue,"I love these shoes. They are the most comfortable ones I own, so I had to buy a pair in every color."
4,"The most comfortable, go anywhere shoes!","I love my Merrells. I bought this pair to replace an older pair that worn out over the years. These shoes are comfortable, sturdy, and goes with so many outfits. I've worn them with jeans, khakis, and shorts, along with almost any top you can think of. I've walked with them everywhere. These are great for vacations when space is an issue since they are so versatile.My only complaint about the Jungle Moc is that the flaps at the top instep of the shoe curls up a bit after a few wears. The curling is not too noticeable but slightly annoying. However, that does not stop me from wearing (and loving) these shoes.Overall, The comfort and fit alone makes these shoes worth every penny."
2,sizing,I have several other pairs of Merrell shoes. This style was not true to the size of the other Merrells I have had. They were too big and I had to return them.
4,Excellant comfort for your foot!,"I work in a casino and am on my feet for the whole 8 hour shift. I am not a tiny women either, so my feet would hurt by shifts end. I am so glad I found these Merrell Jungle Moc shoes on the web. Once you break them in a bit, the confort is unbeleiveable. Prior to getting my mocs I bought several different style shoes from local stores. All went back. I would recommend these to everyone. If you have heel spur issues, I would recommend you get the slip on with no backs though."
2,Something changed,"I have purchased this exact product for at least 10 years for my daughter, as she loves them. For some reason even after returning and trying again, these did not fit. She has NOT lost weight, her foot has not changed. She just kept walking out of the heel but the length was ok. We returned them AND had to pay for shipping again. WeJungle Moc Nubuck Kids by Merrell are very disappointed. A few years ago she told me she felt the quality of them changed for the worse, didn't last as long but she still loved them. NOw it seems she will have to find an alternative. So sad."
5,Best shoes ever,"My feet are so happy in Merrell's Jungle Mocs. I've been through many pairs and they are the first and only shoes that I can wear pain-free. Great insoles, great support. I'm glad Amazon carries them. I can walk for hours in my Jungle Mocs. I recommend them highly."
1,Great Shoes Very Bad Customer Service,The suede jungle moc shoes are the most comfortable shoes on earth. They are just like walking on clouds. Only problem is I received the wrong shoe and UpFootGear are not helpful at all and have now passed me on to a distributor and are now ignoring me. What a shame for Merrell to have such a poor customer service company representing them and their fantastic shoes.
4,pretty nice,i wear them at my military freefall jumps. and they are pretty nice. liht and strong!! i recomend you!
3,Best one yet,This is the movie you haver to see. The magic is awsome and it is the best movie with a twist that I have ever seen. It is about two men who worked together in magic shows and one guy ( Cristain Bale) ties the other guys ( Hugh Jackmans) girl friend up to do a water escape trick and she dies. Then the two men become enimys and mess up each others acts and trys to be the better magic man. It is a confusing movie so it is best to watch it when there is peace and quit so you can fully understand it. This movie is worth every pennie BUY IT TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Didn't %100 get it,"This was a good movie, not great. I felt the end twist came a bit out if the blue. The acting was excellent and the magic effects interesting. Worth sewing."
3,Could have been MUCH better... see ILLUSIONIST instead,"Unfortunatley PRESTIGE did not quite live up to the ""dueling magicians"" concept the film appeared it would be in the previews.Also, we always hate films that pretty much start near the end, then tell the whole story in backflash.......... that knocks 1/2 the wind out of a film's sails everytime.Great idea, but faltered in it's execution despite all the great talent involved.The ILLUSIONIST was a much more entertaining period piece about magic withgood plot twists"
3,Prestige vs. Illusionist,"""The Illusionist"" is a better film than this one. Though this movie draws you in and is beautifully filmed, the payoff at the end is ridiculous ... a real letdown. By contract, ""The Illusionist"" pulls off its big finish, emerging not only as the more intelligent and well-acted but also the more satisfying film. Check it out."
2,Better than watching Home and Away,"I love Christian and Hugh - Aussie Aussie Aussie - but sorry boys, this was a little boring. I guessed the secret mid movie. But Scarlett looked hot as always - V jealous. Good eye candy!!!!!"
2,"Tedious, without gravitas","This movie is unbelievably tedious, mostly because there is nothing likable about either of the magicians (histrionically portrayed by Hugh Jackfman and Christian Bale), who compete to present the best magic trick at the turn of century. Most pleasing are Scarlett Johansson's thunderously big thighs wiggling as she prances around on stage--she epitomizes ""booty-licious."""
2,a smaller,"and uglier brother of the illusionist.Not worth a dying man's hour to watch, and certainly not worth the purchase price."
2,Put it in the yard sale box,"Set in turn-of-the-century London (with a side trip to Colorado), this is the story of two stage magicians locked in a bitter rivalry. We found the story hard to follow. It often seemed unclear who was who and who was doing what to whom. The story at times veered off into love interests, but they too were a little confusing, poorly done, and bland, adding nothing to the story. Except for Michael Caine's supporting role, the characters never came to life, and we had no reason to care about them. My wife's reaction: watch it again someday to see if it makes more sense on a second viewing. My reaction: Put it in the yard sale box."
3,The prestige,I would have enjoyed the story if the lighting had not been so dark that I had trougle identifying the actors.
4,"""Hate traps us by binding us too tightly to our adversary.""","I enjoyed this movie and would rate it as the second best movie I saw in the theaters last year (after The Departed). Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play very convincing roles and succeed brilliantly in drawing you into and submersing you in their endless cycle of revenge. Does this movie have some small plot holes? Yes. Does it leave some questions unanswered? Yeah, but, overall, this is an enjoyable roller coaster ride and is much darker than I anticipated. I've never been big on magicians, but this one definitely had me saying ""wow"". Somewhat predictable and somewhat off the wall - this one definitely leaves you wanting to make peace with people."
4,Can't only see it once...,"An above average movie. Very nice plot, although i doubt with seeing it one time that everything is completely clear...Movie is about two men who are magicians. One of them is married to a woman who dies during one of the acts. The man claims that his partner might have been involved. So, the movie carries on with these two men trying to outdo the other in magic and getting revenge.You have to pay really close attention to what is going on, as it is very easy to get lost in the plot. It goes back and forth from past to future. Good acting. A good story. Nicely done.However, i would have to see it a couple of times more to completely understand it. It is very difficult to know the motives for each scene. The language was a bit hard to understand at times too.An overall good movie. Recommended."
5,Wow! One of the Best of 2006 for Sure!,"I saw the first half of this at school twice, and that was enough to get me to buy it. The end....well, that's an entirely different story! What a way to wrap up such a fantastic film! The Prestige does what a lot of two-hour films try to do: it keeps you entertained! This one will be in my collection for a long time......I love it.Easily one of my top three for '06."
5,Another excellent Nolan film,Perhaps the best mind bending movie I have ever seen. Like many of Christopher Nolan's movies the Prestige will you keep you interested and guessing from beginning to end. The performances of Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are both as good as any. This movie is a definite buy and watch many times.
5,Fantastic film.,"This is in my top 5 movies of all time. the acting is excellent, but the story line is so spectacular, able to include and hold deep questions and ideas on life while remaining highly watchable for all audiences. I find this to be the most completely complete film by Christopher Nolan."
4,"Decent flick, long live Tesla!","The movie gets points for being engaging and dramatic, and for makingyou think a bit in order to follow the chopped up timeline. The moviegets a bonus point for honoring the great Nikola Tesla. However, it loses that extra point for creating the ridiculous doppleganger machine(""Attention Checkov, this is the Captain, please beam us up! zzzzoooolllluuuulllluuuuu""). Ok, that was a downer, totally ridiculous ending, but I was taken up in the story. Jackman and Baledo good work, as of course does Sir Caine. SJ, meanwhile showed as much emotion as a lamp post and was awful. Finnaly, David Bowie nailed Tesla, great work. I'd like to see him on the stage again."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The Prestige is an enjoyable enough and impeccably produced film, but the twists and turns are too many and too much to be believed, so much so that even the final ""talking killer"" revelatory moment doesn't tie up all the loose ends it's: fun to watch but increasingly frustrating to think about."
2,HD Exclusive in Europe,"This movie is ultimately confusing to someone who's a natural blonde like me. It starts at the end, ends at the beginning, and throws in an unnatural amount of twists & turns throughout the duration. It's complicated, and it doesn't help that I was trying to work out the final twist, but I didn't. It was right there I should have done.The Prestige has an outstanding cast, including Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale (who I'm still not sure about as an actor), a short turn by Piper Perabo, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johannssen and a surprising appearance by David Bowie! Of all people! (He's looking old.)I have to say this movie kept me riveted throughout, but I just couldn't understand it. A big hand for all those who could. I just couldn't follow it. But why should a film about magicians/illusionists be straight forward?"
2,Not at all magic,"Maybe it's just me, but I found the movie oonfusing and unwatchable. I'd rather not work hard to keep track of time frames and where the characters are supposed to be, or even if they should be."
2,"Well acted, beautiful imagery, but SLOW, DULL and OBVIOUS.","All-star, REALLY HOT, awesome cast; excellent acting, great costuming and beautiful cinematography. A+ shirtless Jackman scene.However, a convoluted mess of a movie with a labyrinthine storyline that is made mind-numbingly clear by the repeated insertion of painfully obvious foreshadowing. The story circled back upon itself several times, which made the excruciatingly too-long dramatic scenes seem even longer in a deja-vu sort of way. Could have been half an hour shorter, takes an ETERNITY to get to the point. I would have enjoyed it more had I fast forwarded through most of it. I'm glad I watched it, but a second viewing might be the cure for insomnia."
1,"Bad Plot Twist, Jumps Around, Poor Acting, No Message, and Historically Inaccurate","The title says it all. Call us movie snobs, but this movie is a waste of time. The movie jumps around, the twist is stupid, and the outlandish historical claims about significant contributors to our society, including Tesla and Edison are inexcusable."
1,Why no downloads?,I would like to watch this online in Australia. I want to pay for it - iI do not want to steal. Why isn't it available to buy as a download?
1,Do Yourself a Favor - Skip It,"Not only does this movie last for what seems like 15 years, the extremely talky end scene feels like another 20. Which wouldn't be so bad if the movie wasn't a boring downer. The ""secret"" of the movie is obvious to anyone over 7, and is even revealed 1/3 of the way through. And yet it plods endlessly on, like a truly bad opera. You've got better things to do with 35 years. The choppy flashback structure breaks up the story so much you never get an emotional connection with the characters. Which would be difficult anyway, since they're all repulsive. Not a protagonist among the lot; you're practically rooting for them all to come to a terrible end. The Instant Video rental is especially annoying as the movie is extremely dark and almost impossible to see under home conditions, while the sound is muffled and nearly unintelligible for large sections. I only paid $2 and I feel cheated. Avoid."
5,One Of The Best Films Of Recent Time,"I went to see ""The Prestige"" in the theater with little to no clue of what it is about. OK, I admit it, Scarlett Johansson's co-starring in the film ignited my interest in seeing it. And I was pleasantly surprised by every possible aspect. The film boasts a spetacular a-list cast that serves its characters in the best possible way. I wasn't aware of the fact that the film is based on a novel, nontheless, the plot is intriguing, suspenseful and will keep you on the edge of your seat...I love the fact that it does not take place in modern times, but about a century ago; It provides the film with the right energy and vibe. I was happy to see it did well at the box-office, it deserves it! Don't miss out on this great film."
5,As fine as film gets.,"I am an aspiring filmmaker and have always had my eyes peeled for the next groundbreaking movie. I never saw this until a couple of weeks ago, and it is easily one of the very best movies i have ever seen. worth every penny!"
5,Entertaining Mystery,"Viewed this after reading some prior reviews, curious if I could anticipate the ending. While it's true you won't like the key characters mid-movie, the acting was great, and I'm sure most people will enjoy this flick even if they are confused at the end. How many films can you say that about!"
3,Left me wanting more,"I liked this move with all it's twists and turns, right up until the very end where the Prestige was revealed, then I didn't like it so much. I think I got tired from suspending my disbelief for so long. Hugh Jackman is a great actor and so is Christen Bale, but the story was not my cup of tea. Look for a neat-o performance from David Bowie as Nichola Tesla."
4,Interesting,It was good. Saw the movie when it first came out. Appreciate a movie that makes you think unlike so many other movies these days.
3,What is real and what is magic?,"A feud between between two magicians and the aid of the magician's assistants seem to light up to a Tesla spark.If you like historical drama with an element of horror and drama,you might like this film.It has a sci fi twist involving Tesla's wireless power transmission schemethat was passed on at the beginning of the last century.I enjoyed the movie, but think that it made too much of magic trick secrets."
3,Movie good but,"I liked the movie, but it's not the big deal. However I think there are important things amazon need to do to improve the service, like improve the quality of the streaming, increase the compatibility with devices (I have a Wii and a Toshiba Blue Ray and they are not supported) and finally, add subtitles. Really amazon, subtitles are important!!"
3,Christopher Nolan has done better.,"Kind of a fake Memento. I like the movie, don't get me wrong, but Nolan has done better and this one was just so ""inside"" that i couldn't get it all together in my mind afterwards."
5,A Great Pledge,"A little dark and mixes up history a bit, but great performances make this very engaging retro-scifi. Michael Cane is great as always"
4,"Superior to ""The Illusionist""...","Its a shame that these films came out in such close proximity as now nearly every reviewer (including this one) links one to the other. The Prestige is the far better film in nearly every way...The acting is excellent (with the exception of David Bowie and his ridiculous Russian accent), the structure fantastic--I love films like this that jump back and forth between events and time periods as long as the jumps are done so purposefully and not just to be ""artistic"" and Nolan does a very good job at this. The tone was dark without being overbearing. The film also does a nice job of toying with the audiences emotions, making you root for one character one minute and then against the same character the next. One of the more intelligent and enjoyable films from '06 that I have seen..."
2,A major disappointment,"""The Prestige"" wasn't really a bad movie, but it did try too hard to be altogether too clever. The problem isn't the cast who are uniformly excellent. The problem is the plot and the script which simply have too many holes, compounded by confusing presentation which jumps back and forth through time and expects the audience to keep up. Not that it's really that hard to keep up, but in the end I got the feeling that it was all just fancy footwork to keep you from realizing just how weak the plot really was.WARNING: Spoiler ahead!Without trying to spoil too much, the ending was especially lame and ultimately unsatisfying. Specifically, it morphed without warning from a well-executed character-driven picture with involving the mechanics and psychology of illusion, into a sci-fi film - and not a very good one at that. Nicola Tesla's descendants should sue everyone involved!A great actor's showcase, but still not recommended..."
3,"Well Crafted, but too Dark for my Tastes","I missed this movie in the theater, but I always wanted to see it. So when I ordered the dvd I couldn't wait to watch it. I was wondering what twists and turns it had and there were many, but esthetically, I was put off by the intensity of the rivalry and the form it took. It was just too dark. I can say it was a top notch production, with convincing performances and meticulous details, but it's not for everyone. The lengths these men go to is unsettling and sad. If you tend to like the modern trend toward dark movies without a satisfactory resolution, this may be for you. Otherwise, I can't recommend it."
3,Magic and revenge,obviously don't mix. It is an okay movie with great actors. I found myself rooting for one and then turning on him in the end. If the ending hadn't been just the opposite of the beginning I might have liked it. I knew the whole ending by 45 minutes into the show. ALMOST too predictable.
2,Runs out of runway....,"A really intriguing film up until the final payoff. At that point it requires a sci-fi leap of faith that many will be unable to make, myself and my wife included. Great cast (especially the treat of David Bowie) that ultimately almost redeems the end game plot conceit...but not quite.Reminds me of landing jumbo jets at the old Austin airport. Drop out of the sky like a rock but get it down safely and no one complains because they're just glad to get home."
4,i agreee well written,i enjoyed this film i liked the back ground and the diffrent scenes and though i was a tad bit lost in a scene or two i thought it was one of the years best films this year so far
3,Don't mistake the ending for Science Fiction!,"I was ready to give this movie 5-stars until the ending. In my opinion good acting, interesting plot twists, a rational (if somewhat convoluted) plot line, some fascinating illusions, great period photography.Then the psuedo-science, supernatural ending. Folks, science fiction is extrapolation of known science into realms of the possible. Everything else is fantasy or supernatural fiction. We certainly know enough about electricity to know the premise of the ending is totally implausible.This movie leads us down a path where the illusions, no matter how fantastic they seem, obey laws of physics and plausibility. Then we're hit with a supernatural ending. It appears the scriptwriters wrote themselves into a corner and couldn't determine a rational, plausible method to explain the final illusion of the movie. They simply resorted to fantasy. Too bad since I really wanted to enjoy this movie."
1,Awful!,"I bought it because the actors are usually always good, but the movie is very negative to the point that I had to turn it off."
3,Sleight of hand,"This movie has a lot going for it, strong performers, strong performances, and a solid premise. Some of the twists and turns are a little easy to see through, but the film does build emotionally and I do think most people will be intrigued to see how it turns out. For my money though, I don't think it was the film's close release to ""The Illusionst"" that diminished its box office appeal, I think it was a miscalculated ending. I'm not going to give anything away, but I think the filmmakers took a calculated risk (and made a mistake) in choosing the last man standing. I think it would have been more emotionally satisfying the other way around, and a bigger crowd pleaser. Another reviewer here felt differently, however, and you may, too."
3,I MUST disagree,"I'll keep this short and to the point: the acting was terrific, the casting superb. The ending, however, was a cop-out; it was the ending that I told myself couldn't be, purely because of it's utter impausibility.**Spoiler Warning**I wanted a logical explanation and got a cripplingly easy answer instead.**End Spoiler Warning**Too bad."
2,See The Illusionist instead,"You end up hating everyone in the end...there are no heros. The magic was historic and accurate for the era (though lots of modernism and creative license was used to entertain the crowds of today, who wouldn't sit through the longer ""older"" presentations). Interesting story...somewhat predictable ""twist"". See ""The Illusionist"" instead."
5,A Note To Prospective Viewers/Buyers Of This Movie...,"Just so we can stem the tide of surly, dissatisfied reviewers who obviously lack an imagination or sense of wonder:THERE IS SCIENCE FICTION IN THIS MOVIE. THERE IS FANTASY IN THIS MOVIE.Ok? It's not a moldy period piece about the 19th century. If that's what you are looking for, look elsewhere.Now, for those of you who actually have an imagination and enjoy seeing the impossible become possible: The Prestige was probably the best picture of 2006, despite what Oscar thought. A fantastic film. Five stars!"
3,"""It is inhuman to be so cold""","""It is inhuman to be so cold"", says one of the film's characters, and that's what ""The Prestige"" (2006) directed by Christopher Nolan is above all. It is technically well done, it is dark, it is twisted (too many twists to my taste) and it could be described as ""Memento"" meets ""Rashmon"" judging by the way the story of obsession, rivalry, hatred, and losing all human feelings has been told. Yes, it is well done by in the end I don't care about any of its main characters because more than anything, their story reminds of Atreus and Thyestes, two brothers from the Greek Mythology where each would go very far to hurt and to humiliate the sibling. The tricks are magic but when there is nothing but hatred (and some science fiction thrown in for more effect) behind the magic, I don't want to be tricked. I prefer ""The Illusionist"" that was released the same year -there is love and light behind the secrets and tricks, and I want to stay there."
3,It's the ending that killed it,"I have to admit that when I first sat down to watch this, I was prepared to hate it. I was tired and being forced to watch it against my will. Much to my surprise, the movie soon captured my interest. The emotions and obsessions of the two main characters was built up quite well.But then the end. With the sci-fi element. I love sci-fi, but in this movie, in my opinion, it ruined the ending. It made everything not so believable. It ruined the magic of the movie and the magic was a great element in this movie and to suddenly add the sci-fi in it was not a great move.Other then a not so great ending, the movie was thoroughly enjoyable and definitely deserves a watch but maybe not a buy."
3,The Prestige,"I didn't think this movie was awesome, but it was okay. Don't do anything else (like sewing) when you are watching it, your eyes have to be on the screen at all times or you will be completely lost."
3,Good cast; Disappointing story,"It's interesting that The Prestige and The Illusionist came out so closely together. I saw The Illusionist in the theater and totally loved it. I just saw The Prestige now, having borrowed it from the public library. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.The cast is first rate. Any film that features Michael Caine and David Bowie is probably worth seeing. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were both very good. The performances kept me watching.The inclusion of Nichola Tesla and his battle with Thomas Edison was interesting and one could say that their rivalry mirrored that of the two magicians here. What bothered me most was the ending. It was a cheap trick and it spoiled the whole movie for me. What a contrast with the inspired ending of The Illusionist.In a nutshell, The Prestige is about hate; The Illusionist is about love!"
3,Overhyped,"The Prestige just didn't live up to its hype. The cinematography was wonderful, but the twists were dull and expected. I recommend watching the Illusionist instead."
4,Very Well Done,I'm an avid movie fan and was not at all disappointed with this one. I like stuff with twists and turns that keeps your imagination and intellect busy and reeling. This was a fantastic movie and I have literally thought about it over and over. It's definately one to watch many many times. Do not blink or go to the bathroom. Definately enjoyable and twisty.BN
5,Prestige is amazing!!!,This is a great movie with terrific acting and a compelling plot. Looks awesome on blu ray.
3,Ho - Hum,"You think they could have come up with a better script. Good actors, but the script had them behaving like 3-year olds playing tit-to-tat throughout. Oh good grief - this isn't entertainment. Wouldn't recommend it."
4,"An entirely diverting film... enjoyable, with a slight twist","I thought this was an entertaining, engrossing film, with enough of a plot twist to keep us engaged, and a freshing formalism to the script -- particularly in its use of plot symmetries and (metaphorical) mirror-image contrasts. The acting was quite nice -- although the younger actors are all a tad callow, Michael Caine and David Bowie were both delightful onscreen, each stealing the show in his own way. This is hardly a masterpiece or an immortal work of cinema, but it's several notches above the current state of action-suspense dramas, mid-decade in the '00s. Definitely worth checking out."
3,Just WAY too complicated ....,Sorry it had just too too many cute things for me to enjoy it.It isn't till the end of the movie that it becomes clear WHY the wife of one of the main characters knew when her husband said 'I love you' and he meant it and the days when he said it and he didn't mean it ... She says that the day he means it makes her life worthwhile' ....I dont want to spoil the movie but maybe she should have put a magic marker big X on his rear ..... HMMMMMEver since I saw the 'Ipcress File' I am a Micheal Cane junkie so The Prestiege got 3 stars otherwise .... well I would have made this movie disappear much faster than the birds they made disappear......If you are a Micheal Cane 'nut' get this movie if not then better to put your hand on the window sill and slam the window shut ... you'll enjoy that more than this movie!!
3,Could be better--,"Just saw the movie-- but could not hear the dialog as the loud background music or whatever the constant sound was, obliterated much of what was being said. So visually I had to figure out what was happening, while also trying to discern what they were saying. Didn't need magic, though there was some great tricks-- only dialog that could be heard. ""The Illusionist"" was much more intriguing and memorable."
3,amber,If you don't want to know what happens in the movie then stop reading this review right now! Ok so I was totally in to the movie until the whole twin brother thing came up. I could even kinda sorta except that but then it got in to the cloning thing too. Clones in 1827?! Are you kidding me!!! So how many times was whats his face killed? What an unbeliable ending. Like I said I was loving it UNTIL the end!
1,"Too long, repetitive, even dull","If you have seen this movie, then run, don't walk to a theatre near you to see a far superior film: The Illusionist! It will help get your mind off this mess of a film.If you haven't seen The Prestige, then be aware that the film has little to nothing to do with magic or magicians. This is a period piece about revenge in all its grotesque glory. There are no redeeming social values to be discovered nor any morality at all.In addition the film defames the brilliant Nikola Tesla!The performances are well crafted by the actors, but the script is so weak, at times confusing, and so narrow in scope that one loses interest in who wins or loses."
1,"Wow! What an amazing trick...,","One minute I was sitting uncomfortably in a cinema throwing up at the thought of having to sit all the way through 'The Illusionist' and suddenly, poof! What seemed like an eternity, but was probably a few months, I had been magically transported in time and found myself watching the same movie but with different actors.Then I threw up all over again.Tripe!"
1,"Dull, Stupid","This movie starts out well but quickly falls apart due to the addition of a certain ""magical technique"" and the very heavy revenge driven plot line. The movie is all about revenge for the death of a character we only saw for a few minutes. Any normal person would have simply walked away but these two go after each other for years and we all know how that ends. The plot twist was nice but easy to figure out so this movie ended up being dull, and stupid."
2,REVENGE IS AN OBSESSION - It can never be satisfied not,"even with oneself dying, repeatedly. The Prestige is to learn to forgive,INSTANTLY. THERE IS MAGIC IN THe ACT. NOT FOR CHILDREN."
5,WOW! Very surprised!,"This movie came out around the time The Illusionist came out. Had no desire to see it after seeing that other magic kind of movie. However, this movie was on tv, I came into the middle of it and boom.. hook line and sinker! I couldnt stop watching it. I bought the movie so I could see the whole thing. Although I thought The Illusionist was a good movie, The Prestige offers so much more complexity to the story and overall was excellent. I thought the cast was a perfect fit for all the characters! Just a great movie!!!!"
4,Are You Watching Closely ?,Very enjoyable film in my view with a good plot and a fair few twists and turns along the way. Very good acting on the whole from all the cast and in particular from Jackman and Caine. Worth a watch for sure.
4,The Prestige,The Prestige took us awhile to understand. It was an intriguing movie. I think I might have to watch again to understand it fully.
5,Incredible movie,Twists and turns at every corner. Gripping movie. Typical Christopher Nolan. I have watched many Nolan movies. They are all great.
3,a grand illusion.,"well it made my money disappear.a lot of hype when it came out,so i made the purchase.not the best decision i ever made,but not the worse.it was o.k.,but certainly not worth the price."
4,great movie,this is a great movie... so much so that i want to show it to a friend... i bought it just so that she could see it... the weekend after we saw it... i found that i already owned the movie... so i guess i really like it.
5,Love it!,"I absolutely love this movie! Purchasing it the movie was simple, and it arrived shortly after in the mail. I watch it all the time! Great buy!"
3,"Intriguing, Ultimately Disappointing","I was drawn to this movie because I am a fan of Christopher Nolan's other movies, such as Momento. The movie was typical of his work, featuring a dense, winding plot that requires film watchers to pay close attention at all times. I found the movie quite entertaining, and enjoyed piecing together the various plot clues and anticipating the 'twist' likely to occur at the conclusion.Ultimately, however, I was disappointed by the film's final moments. I was intrigued by cutter's comment early in the movie that ""You're a magician, not a wizard."" I had hoped this was foreshadowing, and that all of the seemingly inexplicable events would somehow be logically converge in the end.Quite to the contrary, the ending of the movie is pure sci-fi, and it cheapened a film which otherwise featured fantastic but logical screenplay."
3,Not for prestige...,"The item I had purchase came in excellent condition, on time, and as described. Recommend this seller. As quality of this movie - big stars in an average movie. The ""Illusionist"" is way much better to compare with. I personally will NOT recommend this movie to be in your collection."
5,ABRACADABABRA! Let this film reach out a grab ya!,"A film that lives up to its promise in all ways. A PRESTO! ending. Great performances, direction, setting, dialogue, writing and editing. Don't let this one disappear before your eyes.Getting into, ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Sleuth"" territory."
3,Not Exactly Mystifying,"I was really excited about this movie. It has an excellent cast and a directer known for dark, twist-filled tales. I was rather disappointed though, to be honest. Although interesting looking, the wasn't anything memorable in cinematography. the acting was good, but nobody's best work. The plot was compelling, but the ""suprise ending"" didn't really make up for the holes thoughout.I particularly wanted to know by the end of the movie how electricity did what it supposedly did, and what the wife actually thought about her husband.The ending makes the 2+ hours pretty much worth it, but don't expect to be blown away."
4,Good movie.,"Having just watch the Illusionist I decided to buy this movie as I missed both of them at the theater. While I find the Illusionist a better movie than The Prestige, both are good movies well worth having. I found this movie a bit hard to follow as you really have to pay attention. This is defiantly a movie that you have to watch multiple times to see something you missed the last time due to it's fast pace. If you like magic then this is a must have movie."
3,Fairy tales world meets distopia,"Albert or the book of man: the more earth basd sequel which contrasts the gay paradis country with a distopian view of earth. Trying to merge science-fiction, gay erotica, humanoid alien culture (including instead of the wellknown third eye an extra lust-spending third testicle) and new age philosopy this book can be recomended to the collector of gay science fiction and fantasy. It has some nice erotic scenes as well. Probably a good summer read."
4,Good value extension pack,"Had old blue tracks before. You get many pieces of tracks on this set and would nicely complement any other Thomas Trackmaster sets you may have. These new tracks are much nicer than the old blue ones as you get to elevate the tracks as well. Look nicer and more durable as well. However, this set does not come with any adaptors to allow the old blue tracks to be used together. I have seen special editions of the new Trackmaster sets that come with the adaptors so worth looking out for these. Otherwise you can buy the adaptors separately but they are very pricey."
4,Some parts are missing!,"I got this expansion packs for my trackmaster Thomas rail way system. However, I also have a set of the motorized Thomas RR track that I want to connect to my trackmaster system. Just as another reviewer mentioned, there are several parts missing, including two Trackmaster to motorized RR system adapter that are shown on the picture for this product. First of all, the box that I actually received is totally different from the box shown here for the product. Secondly, the contents are different. I can only give it 4 stars because the misleading advertisement! Other than that, it is a good expansion set for your trackmaster rail road system."
2,"Read it carefully, this is a box of plastic tracks","They are fine, if you want plastic tracks - a lot of plastic tracks. The regular wooden track trains work with them, but the regular wooden tracks do not. I imagine I didn't read it closely enough, as I thought I was ordering wooden tracks, and was very disappointed when I opened it. My kids still liked them, but they just don't expand stuff we already have."
4,Thomas track set,Great! A lot of pieces to expand the Thomas tracks!!Easily fits with all Thomas's sets!!!
5,Delta grinding wheel,I was pleased with the timely manner in which the grinding wheel was shipped and the packaging was excelent. I was unable to find this item localy. Thank You Amazon.
2,A Big Caveat,"In general I agree with both the prior reviewers as to the value of the CD to Stravinsky collectors.However, neither mentions a really big problem. The sounds quality resembles what you would get by throwing a couple of wet blankets over the microphones, or maybe moving the mikes out to the lobby.The disk originates from 1996. DG was useing something they called ""4D"" DDD recording technology. Thankfuly it died a quick and well deserved death.If you can put up with something that sounds like average mid 1950 mono quality only in stereo, you are good to go. Otherwise I suggest trying to get a cheap version from an Amazon merchant.Worth having for Stravinskians for the reasons other reviewers have stated, but be aware of what you're getting. Revier GD calls ""the 1945 Firebird suite well worth hearing if lacking just a little in color and magic."" I agree. But the color and magic is missing because of the sound problems.The 2 stars are for the really poor quality, otherwise 4 stars."
4,Better than expected science fiction.,"Of several lower budget, recent SF movies I rented (e.g., Earthstorm and Android Apocalypse ... even the higher budget, more mainstream The Fountain, for that matter), this was definitely my favorite. I enjoyed the plentiful SF ideas and the lead actress. They actually tried on the special effects, keeping the visuals coming (however nowhere near state-of-the-art, Star Wars type realism). Recommended for those who like to read SF, appreciate better writing, but can forgive the budgetary limitations."
1,Do not even rent this movie...,This movie is bad. It is long and it has terrible production. The movie is like narrated by her daughter. Bad special effects. You can see the terrible movie production in everything. Do not waste your time and money.
1,Horrendous - if only there were a 0 star rating.,"A terrible film with no attempt at coherent plot. I've read the plot summary and still can't connect it with the film. Neil Johnson is obviously some narcissistic hack, as is the case with anybody being the writer, director, composer and acting in his own film. What further disturbs me is someone's attempt to boost the IMDB rating and spread good reviews about this film. The only thing monumental about this film is it has to be the worst film I have seen thus far in my life. Don't bother, don't buy, don't support shameful film making like this."
1,Stupidist movie in the history of mankind,Worst waste of two hours ever. We must have been two of the ten people ever to see the end of the movie. If you think you are going to make it to the end of the movie...shoot yourself first. My ears are still bleeding. Porky's revenge deserved an emmy compared to this piece of cosmic crapola.
2,So-so,Science fiction it is but that is about it. Not a worthwhile DVD to have as the story line is OK but the narration style and poor acting really makes it almost boring to watch. Thank goodness for fast forward. That made it barable.
1,Waste of time,"What a dog. Germans may be able to make cars but not movies. Fortunately this was just a free blockbuster rental. Why the low rating?Basic plot line- Good girl running from bad people/ one bad person who refuses to stay dead. Spoiler Alert: It seems like 90% of the movie is her hiking up one sand dune and down the other. Last 5 minutes of the film, girl chooses to end her life so the universe can collapse in on itself and start again. No plot, No acting,No good CGA either. The other 2 reviewers must have been snoozing to give it 5 stars. Instead of wasting your time and money on this movie visit kiva org and provide a small micro-loan to a 3rd world needy someone. :-)"
1,awefull movie,"I have to agree with the first reviewer. I rented this movie at blockbuster because I couldn't find anything interesting lately in the SCIFI theme. This movie is terrible, no plot, CGI graphics are a joke. I thought I was watching Dr. Who from the old days that's how bad the CGI is and their screenplay...well none! It's just a lady running up and down dunes running away from bad guy and guess what she has a video game addiction that she has to subdue with drugs!!! In the end she commits sucide to save and restart the universe...oh yeah the big bang!!! What a joke!!!! ha..ha..ha..ha..ha..ha!!!!!!! Don't even buy it and if you don't believe me rent it first and judge for yourself!!! I gave it 1 star because I can't give it 0!!! haaaa...ha.ha..ha..ha!!!"
3,"It's good, not excellent","I must agree with some reviewers, that's a frustration to see that the crimesmany times are not resolved by the protagonists. The villain simply show up.The main idea is very good, the dialogue is great (Bendis is a master of dialogue), the art is very good too, but sometimes the chemistry between the main characters don't really take off.But It's really worth your time. No doubt."
1,It's so poorly bound that some pages cannot be read,"I was looking forward to reading this, but I can't read it because of the way some of the pages are bound. I got to page 9 and had to skip over stuff because over half the dialogue is missing because of the binding."
3,"Good Story, Bad Collection","I really like this story but there are some major execution issues with the collection. The binding, as said in other reviews, is despicable and honestly makes some parts of the story impossible to follow. Also the actual story content is pretty thin and makes up only slightly over two thirds of the page count. If these problems aren't addressed in the printings of the future volumes I will probably move to paperback collections."
4,Another style,"Karajan's orchestra is very large, and the sound is very high. In addition, the tempo is too fast. Compared with other conductors, Karajan directed Mozart in a style which may be more suitable for Beethoven and Brahms instead of Mozart. It is a little rigid.Take Jupiter as an example, it sounds alike Beethoven's Eroica, especially for the finale.So when I listen to this one, I have to alway keep in mind that I am listening to Karajan, not to Mozart.If you want to only own one set of Mozart's most famous symphonies, it is not your best choice. However, if you want to have more than one set in addition to Walter, Marriner, or Boehm, you can consider this one because it represents another special kind of interpret of Mozart.The recording of this CD is OK."
5,"Not a formula, just the truth.","This is not a book promoting a new way to tell people about Christ. It's not a new formula, flow chart or outline. This book is amazing because it's an honest look at Jesus, who he is, how he lived and how we can imitate him. This book has motivated me to love others as Jesus does. If you're feeling like you're in a slump when it comes to loving others this book may be just what you need."
5,Best Kansai-ben book out there,I'm a college student about to study abroad in the Kansai area and I was looking for a book that would help me to better understand the local dialect. This book is very well laid out and clearly explains the differences between standard Japanese and Kansai dialect and how to use them. There are plenty of examples that help the reader along the way.
4,Awesome Book! Metcha omoroi,This book is absolutely awesome if you want to learn Kansai Ben and be able to understand what the locals are saying to you! This book was very useful for me during my holiday in Kyoto and Osaka. The locals love it when you speak there dialect! So definitely a great buy!
1,eccentric and irritating,"Szidon's interpretations (and they are very much interpretations) are downright weird. He messes with everything, it seems, just to sound different. The tempi are off, he adds awful cadenzas and other passages of his own, and misses the spirit of these pieces entirely. Of course, it was standard practice in Liszt's day not to play the notes as written. In fact, such was expected of any good pianist. But these interpretations are just willfully eccentric, and they destroy the music rather than enhance it. Buy the Jeno Jando versions on the Naxos label--they're cheaper and MUCH better."
1,The man is a pedal freak !,"Mr. Szidon makes excessive use of rubato and pedal, he screws up No.2 and No.12, the greatest ones in my opinion.In No.2 for example, he plays the most cold LASSAN I've ever heard (and I've heard 24 versions of this rhapsody), with very staccato chords, and pedal lack. Then in the Friska, he seems like he wants to make it up for the LASSAN, he uses the pedal in places that are not indicated, in the last chromatic octave run he uses so much pedal that the sound is distorted (I think he saw fffff on the score). His cadenza is awful and the final Prestissimo is screwed up by a ridiculous pianissimo.No.12 is so rubatoed that it seems like he's pausing every minute to change the page.A bad impression in general, get Campanella's version, it is far more warmer than this one. (Too bad it doesn't include the Rhapsodie Espagnole)"
2,the best one? I don't think so...,"I just had my version of the complete hungarian rhapsodies 5 days ago, and I was to pick one between this one and the Michele Campanella's version (Philips Duo), and this last one was absolutely much more superior than the Szidon's version. This is dry, cold, mechanized. The Campanella's one is warm, intense, frenzy... just the way the Liszt music has to be played!!! (at least as I think...)So, I strongly recommend to check another version before purchasing this one..."
2,Not His Best,I was disapointed with this collection of Don Ho's hits. His originals were far superior to those found on this CD.
1,Misled,You won't get little dipper with this slow cooker. Either Amazon or the seller should correct this...
1,Very poor quality and customer service,"We have owned our CrockPot for about 1 year now. The lid handle broke off and the handle on the outside also cracked. I contacted CrockPot (Jarden) by email. In a very nice way I was told that they don't have replacement handles and I would have to buy a lid. You would think they would send me a 10 cent plastic lid handle or if they wanted to keep me as a customer send me a discount coupon for another one. They need to take a lesson from Zappo shoes. Now thats one company I will always buy from. In any case, it could be they have so many customers they can afford to lose a few. I always say ""THE BIGGER A COMPANY GETS, THE SMALLER IT'S BRAIN GETS"""
2,Poor Quality - broke within 6 months,"Bought mine at [...] in Stainless steel, but it is the same model. Worked great for a couple of months. Then the handle broke off of the lid. Could not be repaired. Then, it stopped working altogether. I plug it in and it lights up, but when I try to pick a heat level (high or low) and a time to cook, it won't work. Must have overheated the control panel. I would have been better off getting something with a knob. Now I have to figure out how to return it - if I can. I won't be buying this brand again. Really disappointing."
2,Worked Great...Until It broke.,"Nothing beats coming home to a dinner that cooked itself, or that wonderful smell of a slow cooked roast when you walk in the door. Our crock pot worked great for about a year, used it a handful of times, until I tried to cook a rib-eye roast in it 2 days ago. The indicator lights come on, but the element won't produce any heat. IMO, should get more than 10 uses out of a product before going belly up. I took good care of it too."
2,Uneven heat,"I had been using a thirty-year-old 4 qt crock pot and loved it. So I got this one. Big mistake. I tried to make a chicken dinner in this pot, let it cook for the appropriate length of time, let it cook for an additional hour, and then the chicken was still not done. Maybe it's not the brand but rather the shape of this crock pot - maybe it's better to have a round crock pot and not an oval one. Either way, I want another crock pot like my old one!"
2,Beware the handle!,"I love my Rival Smart Pot, but beware the handle! After less than a dozen uses, the poorly designed handle broke, and fell off. Rival has no replacements for the handle, and are (not surprisingly) always out of stock on the complete lid.At a pot luck at work the other day, there were 4 different Rival crock pots missing handles on the lid. Rival NEEDS to change or replace this defective part!"
2,"Nice crock pot, but it broke quite soon","I like the size and features of this crock pot - especially the fact that it automatically switches to ""keep warm"" when finished. Unfortunately, it simply died after about 5-10 uses. I'm pursuing a warranty replacement now."
2,Gets too hot,"We've had this model for about two years and I can say that 80% of the time, it burns the contents. We've tried to make adjustments assuming that it was us and not the appliance. One example: Crock Pot Pepper Steak (a common recipe). Put it on for 10 hours. Checked it after 6 hours and the meat burnt.We now use everything at 10 hours and check it at 4 hours. Not much else we can do until we find something better. Probably go with one that has dials. Electronics take the control out of cooking."
3,Handle Broke on mine too...,"Love Crock Pots, but they aren't made like they used to be. The handle broke on mine after ten or so uses. Lame."
1,Disturbing,"I purchased the book for a young cousin and after reading it decided it wasn't appropriate. The book was disturbing with references to Larky Mavis's ""baby"" as a deformed bird and other descriptives that I found odd. While the descriptions of Larky's find are surprising, the characters in the book were very traditional (mostly men as professionals like the doctor and others Larky runs into). It seemed like a book for a young girl, but the role models were all men. The ending of the story is anti-climatic and doesn't provide much closure (the winged creature simply lifts Larky up into the sky). I was very disappointed with the purchase."
5,Larky Mavis by Brock Cole,Our eight year old was twitching with suspense waiting to see what Larky had in her bundle that kept growing with each unusual feeding. When the final pages came there was still much discussion about just exactly what this creature was and where they went together.The illustrations where great and also lead to great speculation.
4,Odd fairy tale,"Mavis finds 3 peanuts in the road and eats 2 of them. The last one looks a little like it might be alive, so Mavis doesn't eat it. Instead, she calls it her baby. But the townsfolk don't believe that it is a baby. They call it a worm, a mouse, and a bat and give Mavis a really hard time. Eventually, the little thing grows up to take Mavis away from the cruel townsfolk. Altogether, the book has about 900 words."
2,Barenboim disappointed me again.,"To be fair, the other recording by him I was disappointed by was of a set of pieces which I have only heard one pianist do justice to. Still, I feel like he has missed the mark on these as well."
2,Second-tier Mendelssohn and Boringboim to boot,"The majority of Mendelssohn's works consisted of fluff and flutter reminisent of Mozart on an off-day and these piano pieces certainly aren't among Mendelssohn's small number of masterworks.The fact that these compositions are no more than trifles is made worse by Barenboim's insistence in trying to infuse an element of profundity to them.The result is tedium and annoyance.I owned this 2 disk set for more than 2 years and didn't listen to it more than 7-8 times.Every time I would try and listen boredom would set in and within a few minutes listening became a matter of endurance.I finally traded it off and haven't missed it in the least.It may be a 2 for the price of 1 set but,as usual,such ""bargains"" are hardly a bargain."
5,Holds up and stands out,"I'll be concise: regardless of each new generation's evolving piano-playing expertise, this 1997 recording by the venerable master Barenboim holds up and even stands out as one of the best."
2,"BaGua, easy to recognise hard to explain...","The title says: ""walking meditation"" and you think that you are going to find a lot of information of theory around the art of BaGua... but I got really disappointed. There is some information about the philosophy of BaGua but non that you cant get from a simple introduction to Daoism, and the physical aspect well ""in this position your back is open as Yang and your chest is closed as Yin..."" even a beginner can see that.If you read between the lines you can see that Paul Crompton is a very experienced martial artist but the book does not really explain the real questions (at least not mine =) of BaGua"
5,BAGUA WORKBOOK,"I agree with Mr. Laruso's review that this book is a great study guide for the student, as for Mr Yeung's review I would make the comment that it seems that the core of the arts origin is from the Taoist community whose main goal is longevity. Their is some information on fighting but rely on going to a teacher for that."
2,"some good stories, but not much to improve your game","If you want some good laughs and funny stories, then this book is great. However, serious gin players should look elsewhere."
1,horrible cd,"This self proclaimed ""talking book"" is an absolutely horrible biography if you can even call it that. The narrator goes on for at least 15 minutes about how great she sounds and how much people are seemingly in love with her. The language the author uses to describe Kelly is just rediculous. I mean this person can not be serious. Here is an example from the first track on the cd:""her tunesmithery is deceptively deeper than most charts' pop, devoid of inane fluff and facile sentiment. it sneaks in and luring dissonances abetted by melancholy twists and turns so virtually every song of hers plays nice sweet and sour tricks on the ears""I am so glad I did not buy this CD. I borrowed it from my local library thinking it would be interesting but I was highly disappointed. I could have done a better ""talking book"" myself. Thanks, but not thanks you weirdly obsessed UK author."
3,A Decent Elementary Text,"Slotine's book is less mathematical than some and many may find this refreshing, although this also removes some of the insight. For those students without a really deep mathematical background who are required or elect to take a course on nonlinear controls this is a decent starting point. When this came out, it caused somewhat of a furor as much of it is a simplication of Isidori's Nonlinear Control Systems book. This is a little less general and much more readable. However, be advised that there are misunderstandings in the book concerning sliding mode control, and the section on spacecraft attitude control has been used and abused over many years. Nothing wrong with the latter material however, it has just been ""rediscovered"" many times. There are also a number of mathematical mistakes in the book. Nevertheless the book is very readable and the section on Lyapunov functions is an excellent introduction."
4,Practical approach to non-linear control,"This is a good entry point for learning non-linear control. It is at the advanced undergraduate level, and does not require an advanced background. As an applied textbook, it provides tools for analyzing non-linear system. For a more rigourous theoretical development of non-linear control theory, try Nonlinear Control Design by Marino and Patrizio."
5,Revengce,Al and ED head to ishbal to find scar.Ed hates scar for killing people using alchemy.Though Kimbley the Crimson alchemist(my 2nd favorite character)catches up and attacks them._/o\ -----------|
1,Problems abound with Delta,This insert is made of aluminum and is too thin for it's intended purpose. It has a tendency to bend when heavy pieces of wood are passed over it. It also leaves streaks of red paint across the wood as they are being cut. I had to drill and install an allen screw at the front edge to take up the slop between the insert and table top. And with all these problems how on earth did this thing become it's current price of more then fifty plus dollars? These were about $20.00 a couple (two) years ago. Since when did Delta become so money hungry? If you don't absolutly need this...don't buy it. It's not worth the money.
1,mistake,"I purchased this CD believing it had the long lost song ""Holiday Rap"", however to my dispair, I found it was merely a band performing these songs on their own, and NOT the original artists. Beware! It's not the true songs on this one."
1,Doesn't install on XP,"I usually ignore people who have installation issues as I am quite experienced in debugging simple install problems. This game gives a ""Severe error"" during install on XP SP2 and then promptly exits the installation. For the price, I thought there was not much to lose, but adding shipping it turned out to be a dumb purchase. I will still try to hunt down the problem, but I hate spending my time trying to fix something that says it is XP compatible. Don't waste your time with this!"
3,Oregon Trail,"It was okay. Not exactly what I was expecting, but maybe it has been too many years since I played!! I had to read the book of info (which is long) to remember how to play. May try again, but definitely didn't live up to my excitement!"
2,"Fun when you get it installed, but super difficult to install","The game is fun and provides a blast from the past for adults and a great learning tool for kids. However, it was incredibly difficult to install on a Mac because you need to have a really old font installed on your Mac as well as have the ability to set your screen resolution to a really low setting that some Mac's don't let you do. We ended up having to use a different Mac at my wife's school and used a few tricks we found online (google this product's title and these issues will all come up with solutions) to get it to ultimately work. So make sure you check your computers settings (and the reviews of people who had trouble) before buying this product otherwise you are going to be uber-frustrated."
3,Classic game... not a halo but fun and educational,"This is a good game. Not great graphics or heart racing action but fun game based on planning and efficient use of resources. Some action when you stop to hunt or fish but mainly it is a game for learning and slow non hectic decision making with use of guide books and supply inventory, I played it on my Windows Vista and my son played it on his Windows 7. So feel secure in ordering the game if you have either system."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS XP,"Just purchased this game and it does not run on my computer with windows XP. Went to the help website for compatibility issues and tried that, but it still would not run. Big waste of time and money!!!"
1,An embarrassment,"I am humiliated that I purchased this game. It IS Oregon Trail II, with less quality and cheesy cartoon segments. Please ignore anyone who wrote a positive review about this game, and buy Oregon Trail II. I returned this product before I even finished a game."
4,Accurate and Fun,"I have Windows XP and the game downloaded fine on my computer.This game is very accurate. It does a great job of gently reflecting the racism during the time. But by no means does it encourage racism! It mentions people buying their way out of slavery, the California Gold Rush, etc. It even has the Chinese building the transcontinental railroad! All these details show that the people who developed this game really knew their history.The game also gave great realistic information for anyone who wanted to survive the Oregon trail. The player can learn about the variety of animals to pull a wagon, how to cross a river, about different species of fish and plants, etc.The game was a lot of fun. But it was actually pretty short. The increase in features from older versions may have led to decrease in playing time.I would definitely recommend for any parent to buy this for his/her kid."
1,Will not run on any system,I purchased the Oregon Trail 5th Edition for my grandson. His computer runs Vista. The program crashed on his computer and the screen looked like it had gone into a basic mode (everything was greatly enlarged). Then tried to load it on my Windows 7 with the same result. Next tried to see if it would operate on my old XP. The computer wouldn't even recognize the disk being in the drive. DON'T BUY THIS!!!
2,doesn't work for MAC,my husband and I went and bought this game for our son. And online it said win mac so it was going to work. But it doesn't because of some font and there's no way of getting that font. So a waste of money. Do your reaserch!
2,Oregon Trail,Amazon was great getting this product to me so quickly. My 9 year old son could wait to play it. However it did not work on my Apple computer because you need a certain font that the computer did not have. So I had to load it on my old pc laptop and he plays it on that. Not sure why it isn't compatible with the Apple desktop. I think because it wants to run on classic and most Apples don't even have classic OS9 anymore
2,Oregon Trail,I had order it and worked for about 5 minutes and kept freezing up it was not what i remember it being either however the product was not good.
1,Didn't work!!,"I have no problems with the guys who sent me this product. I was very excited about it coming and I did receive it promptly but the game itself will NOT work! I have been very frustrated. I have a Dell laptop with Windows7 that is only a couple of months old. I tried changing the game to be compatible with every version of Windows, I tried running it in less colors, and I tried running it with a lower screen resolution but nothing worked. I even uninstalled and re-installed the game several times. If anyone knows any solutions to my problem please let me know, but I haven't been able to get this game to work at all!! Waste of money if it will never work."
1,A Flop,My wife and I purchased the very first Oregon Trail many years ago. We looked forward to this updated version. Unfortunately it did not play at all on Windows XP as advertised.
1,Not for Vista Premium!!,"I purchased this item after seeing one of the reviews where the purchaser was able to run it on their Vista Premium system. I tried everything I could but could not get it to run. I contacted the seller who sent instructions on how to make it work, but it still would not function."
1,Do not buy this game if you are a MAC user,This game is not compatible in MAC Computers. Never buy this game if you have a MAC. The company that makes the game is no help either. I asked them for assistance they never returned an answer.I wish I had done thorough research on this game before I bought it from the seller on this site. He knew it did not work. If I were to sell a product I would not have left this out. A big disappointment...of the seller and the game. I was unable to play.
2,A VERY CHEAP GAME!,"THIS EDTION IS THE WORST!! FIRST OF ALL IT IS ALMOST AN EXACT COPY OF OREGON TRAIL 2, EXCEPT FOR A FEW CHANGES! THEY HAVE TAKEN MUSIC FROM THE OTHER VERSIONS, LOOKS LIKE THEY COULD HAVE COME UP WITH NEW MUSIC!! THE NEW CHARACTERS BAD, THEY LOOK LIKE THEY ARE FOR 1ST OR 2ND GRADERS! THE MUSIC OVERLAPS, THE THEME SONG PLAYES WHILE THE MUSIC IN THE TOWN PLAYES. I WOULD NOT RECOMEND BUYING THIS GAME!!"
2,Not very happy,"I was really dissapointed with this game. I bought it because I have a niece who is 10, and I thought that buying her this would give her hours of fun. It is nothing like the original. I was very bored with it, and so was she."
1,I'm a sucker,When this item came in the mail I became suspecious. It wasn't in the original box it only came in a white envelope.I down loaded it on my computer but couldn't access it. I went into the properties of it and found it had a previous owner named Chuck. So due to the copyright element I can't use it.These people that I ordered from should be ashamed of themselves. They should be banned from selling through Amazon.com.So I've got a game I can't use. Thank you very much!!! I rate them as low life.Wilma Sue Rowland
1,doesnt work,"I've tried just about everything I can think of, and the game still won't work. Waste of money."
1,Does not work with XP,"This product does not work with Windows XP. I wasted money on this product. One day when noone buys this product, the company will make it work with XP. Until then, do not buy this product."
1,Does NOT work with Windows XP!!!,"Don't bother purchasing this product if you are running windows XP. I figured I could take the chance that it wouldn't work because it was inexpensive, but even so it turned out to be a waste of my money. The game will install but it WILL NOT RUN. Don't waste your money."
2,DONT BUY THIS,"FIRST notice that most of the five or four stars reviews was worte by software people, seller or merchant of the site. read only review by real customer with their nick name not ."" software user "" or a ""a kid review"" . no this game suck. beside the classic every other version pretty suck. prove me wrong and buy this oregon trail 5 game. you'll see"
1,Oregon Trail 5th Edition,Im sure this is a great game but the copy I got had bad file in it and wouldnt work on my computor so I am afraid to buy another. We used to play the old edition along time ago and my faily loved it but haven't been able to use the one I have now.
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU'RE RUNNING WINDOWS XP!,"DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU'RE RUNNING WINDOWS XP on your computer! I purchased it, and it crashed my computer upon installation. I then tried to download the product from www.broderbund.com, and again it crashed my computer. It has faulty programming and NO CAPATIBILITY with XP! To add insult to injury I've had a lot of difficulty obtaining an RMA from Amazon/NothingButSoftware in order to return it for a refund!"
4,Oregon Trail 5th edition,"I purchased 2 of these games to give as prizes. They camed within a timely manner, however the jewel case on one was cracked. Otherwise, I'm pleased with the purchase."
4,End of my search,"I first played this game years ago and loved it. Lost my game and have been searching for a replacement ever since. I was very happy to find Oregon Trail, and even happier with the price. My game was delivered qucikly and in good shape. I recommend Amazon to anyone."
1,Oregon Trail 5 doesn't work on my computer!,I was excited to order the program to use with my class as we study Westward expansion. I got it today and it will not work on my school laptop- where I need to use it to project in class. VERY disappointed. I skimmed some of the reviews for version 4 that had similar concerns.. then saw a few reviews of edition 5 that noted these problems were fixed. I obviously did not read enough reviews as I now see many comments about this game not working at all. I am very disappointed to order a product that will not work.... a real waste of money.
1,I wish I could use this!,"I have a Mac os x If you have one don't buy this! There is an out of date font that this game needs so it will play. It is not available anywhere, except old macs. New york 18. Perhaps the game is awesome if you get it to open....I have no idea so I gave it one star."
1,Extremely Poor Design !!!,"Cast your pole in the water to catch a fish, I see fish, they don't move. Never ever !!! click on the guide or diary if you do there is no way to resume the game, you must use control alt and delete buttons and then click on end program now. Even knowing NOT to click on dairy or guide One will unintentionly click on it and you will have heck getting back to your desk top. A good thing I do like is the fact one can see how many $$$$ they have as they travel.OREGON TRAIL 5TH EDITION PC"
3,Won't work with Vista,"We got this game to work on our computer for a while, but we couldn't save any files. Also, the game crashes. I've been all over the internet looking for a solution because my son absolutely loves this game. It is very educational and fun too. You have to plan your trip, buy supplies, fish, trade and give out medicines. If you have Vista, you are out of luck with this game, as far as I know."
4,Fun Game,"It's a fun game to play if you have, I don't know, about 45 minutes to do nothing with. Hunting is fun, and you get a real sense of accomplishment once you win, so you should get it. Definitely meant for kids aged 8-10."
3,oregon trail 5th edition,"does not work on windows 7, works on all others, the game does most of the playing,so it is kind of boaring"
4,Great educational and fun game,My son (7 yrs old) and I play this game and we love it. It is alot of fun and very educational. We studied about the Oregon Trail and I bought this game afterwards to help him better understand what he was learning. He now knows more than the lessons we discussed.
1,Doesn't work,"Have the correct system requirements to run this program, installed correctlly, but does not run on the computer. Waste of money. Bummed out!"
1,Did not run!,"I had really enjoyed other games in the series (in my opinion Oregon Trail 2 is the best because of the many choices for start date/time, start city, and destination), and was really looking forward to this game, but unfortunately, I could not get it to run on my machine (a PC with Windows XP). There was no patch or detailed help readily available, and the online advice I found (after hunting around quite a bit) was not helpful."
4,Totally different than the original...,"I'm just putting in my 2 cents to contradict the previous reviewer...this version is totally different than the earliest version he is remembering. Quite sophisticated, teaches history and some natural science in an engaging video format."
3,Childhood game but not the same,"I bought this game as a stocking stuffer for my boyfriend since we both had played it in elementary school.I saw that there were several editions and had assumed the 'newest' one would be the best since it was the only one still available from amazon (not third party).It arrived and seemed easy enough to install and play.However, the game has too many long parts (making you talk to all the characters, backstory).There were no instruction manuals; just the CD. So when there was a question as to how to play.. you had to try to find it within the game (which also wasn't very user friendly).We are both tech-savyy people and it seemed this 'simple' game was more complicated than it needed to be.It didn't have the same feel as the original. I know that they tried to update to keep up with the times but it wasn't quite the same."
4,Oregon Trail,"The Oregon Trail, 5th EditionThe game is really cool and my kids like it very much. The only disadvantage is, that when you have only newer Mac's (do not know with windows) that you won't be able to play the game, as even the fifth edition is an older version, because the New York Font, that is required for the game is no longer available in the newer Mac's. Downloading didn't work either."
3,Oregon Trail,said it would work on vista well definately not to my satisfaction took hours to find a patch for it to work at all. Finally got it to work but some of the features are lost which is a shame. This is a wonderful game used to enjoy it on my xp thus wanted it for my vista it sits collecting dust due to the lost things for vista but I highly recommmend it for XP
3,Technical difficulties,"If you have an Nvidia graphics card don't get this game. There is something about the drivers that doesn't allow it to play. I spent hours trying the tech support offered on the website and installing older drivers, as suggested by another website, neither of which worked. I popped it into my mom's Compaq computer and it works perfectly. It's a fun game if you aren't comparing it to games nowadays. Very nostalgic."
3,Bringing it Back Old School,"Oregon Trail is the education adventure that never seems to die. Although it is revamped and refreshed from the original, there is nothing new here if you played the original. I never bought original Oregon Tral so this was a great buy. the game as a whole is fairly average and should be fun for children."
5,"Great game, and educational!","Didn't mind buying this game for my son. He loves it, and has learned more about the Oregon trail than I thought possible from a video game."
1,Oregon Trail-5th Edition,This CD never worked. Learning Trail Company replaced it with another game but I never did get Oregon Trail. Very sad.
3,Oregon trail 5th edition cd,The cd I bought had the 4th and 5th editions on it. When we tried to play the 5th edition on Windows XP it wouldn't work. When we tried to play the 4th edition it asked us to insert the cd but it was already inserted. I went to the Learning Company website and found out that you have to replace the OT5.EXE file with a new one. You can get the instructions here:http://support.encoreusa.com/kb.asp?id=322After we did that it played fine.
3,Pretty good,"It's a lot of fun, But I have to adjust my laptop screen to a lower pixel every time I play it. At first, it wouldn't even play, but I finally figured out. But for 2 days it wouldn't even begin and gave me problems. Now, it is good."
2,Here is the New York 18 font fix!,"I purchased this and tried to run it on OS X only to run into the same New York 18 font issue everyone else here is complaining about. Well, I happen to be pretty computer-savvy and I found the solution. First, you need to download the file from:[...]Then, on your Mac you need to unzip that file. For some reason Stuffit Expander won't expand it, so you need to download a tool that will. Ez7z works great, and you can get it for free from:[...]Unzip it to your desktop, then double-click on it. You will be presented with a window that has a button called Install Font. Press that and you will get the font installed in your Font Book.Now go back and try to run Oregon Trails and it will work.Enjoy."
4,Good only if you have New York 18 font,I had to search the internet high and low to find the New York 18 font for my mac. While searching I found out that I was not the only one with this problem. So it seems this is a problem with the product and not your computer. They did not take into account people who have updated computers. Once I got the font loaded onto my computer the game was great! It's a great product if you have the font.
1,N,I was disappointed when the website said this product would work for Window's Vista and it didn't. I ended up spending another $20 at Target for the correct game that worked.
1,Ah!,"So I bought this game since it said it was OS X compatible for MAC. It is, only if you have access to OS 9 to get a stupid font called ""New York size 18"". There are thousands of forums online about this font and how nobody who had a new mac can find it since it is only in 9.0, which you have to buy if you don't have it.Try searching ""New York 18 font"" on google, and it will come up with a bunch of forums about people not being able to play because there is an error message saying the game cannot play without New York size 18. There are no places online to download it since it is under apple's name.Shoot, I love Oregon Trail! I wish I didn't update my computer so often.."
1,Will not work on WIndows XP,This game does not work on Windows XP. Warning: do not buy unless you computer is 5+ years old running windows 98.
3,Does Not Work On Macs 10.0 and above,"This game does work on a windows, and it is one of the most fun computer games I've ever played. The Macs are my favorite computer, though, and the game needs the font New York 18 to run. Macs do not have that, but Windows do. I'd suggest that if you have a windows and a mac, download the font from the windows onto a CD, put it in the mac. It is just a little silly that they don't include the font with the game."
4,Its a good game but then...,"When i bought this game i absolutely ADORED it. It was hard to get to oregon city, but it was so fun! the tunes were catchy and it wasn't very boring. I hated when it would say ""starvation"" and then i would get PLENTY of food, and it would say ""a turn for the worse"" and my people would die (and sometimes including me!) but it was still a really good game. But then...i wanted to play it SO BAD so i put it in the computer and it said it was too old to play on my mac computer! I was so mad."
2,I liked OT 3rd edition better,"This game would be good if you have never played any of the other versions. I like my OT3rd edition better, but it will not install on my compter. There is no way of getting in touch with The Learning Company to see what the problem is, so I tried the 5th edition. This is like the Orgegon Trail original version with the OT 3rd edition. Although it doesn't seem as ""real"" as OT 3rd."
3,More complicated than anticipated,"I purchased this game for my 9 year old daughter. Although she was very interested in the concept, she soon lost interest. It is too detailed and time consuming for her attention span. She wanted to do more and plan less! Although this is one area I knew she was weak in, the game couldn't hold my attention for the amount of time it took to set everything up. This item is definately for the child who has large blocks of time to spend on what my daughter called a ""project."""
3,Oregon Trail 5th Edition,"This game moves along very slowly and my son quickly become bored. In order to run this game on Windows XP Home Edition, you will have to jump through some hoops to get it to work with compatibility mode."
1,Oregon Trail doesn't work on newer Macs,"I was very disappointed that this version of Oregon Trail, 5th Edition, does NOT work on a new Mac (10.5 or above) because it lacks the font needed. It was impossible for me to find the font, and the program is worthless. If it is going to require a certain font, then it needs to be included on the program disk."
1,Oregon Trail,"I was unable to get this game to work on my Mac Pro on either the mac side (error because I didn't have a New York 18 font) or the windows side-game would load, but would not open. (my intel mac runs both mac and Windows). So if anyone has answers to these problems buy the game. Otherwise, don't."
1,Did not work.,"We tried in on an older computer of ours with windows vista. It did not work. Disappointed, but didn't have high expectations."
4,Great Kid Fun,My daughter really enjoys playing this game and we enjoy playing with her. It really teaches alot of valuable life lessons. The only problem we had was with the journal. When we clicked on the journal we got stuck inside of it. We couldn't find the option to back out. We finally decided to go back and start all over again.
5,Good game that takes me back,I got this game because Iremembered how much fun it was to play it...I got it to take me back down memory lane...
2,Frustrated,I bought this item from one buyer who told me that the reason the program did not work was that I had older versions of the program on my computer. I went on to buy another. . .same problems.
1,Beware Mac OS 10 users,"Don't bother buying this if you're on a Mac running OS 10. The game won't even run because of a missing font named New York 18. There is no way to get this font except by purchasing it or downloading it from an OS 9 computer. Even this doesn't work for me, though, since the font turns into a unix executable file that won't open when transferred. And the game won't run without it. I'm really disappointed and surprised the company hasn't bothered to fix this or offer a solution or update."
4,Good Game,"Great game for elementary/middle school students. Lots of fun with options to gather food or hunt. Teaches money management when you need to purchase or barter goods, and decision making when you need to rest for the day. Fun events come such as a new town, a river that has to be crossed, or someone catches something, and you have to find a cure. Very fun for those ages, not recommended for anyone older."
1,Don't bother if you have Mac OS X,"Bought this game for my son only to find that it won't work for Mac OS X operating systems. The packaging on the game says that it will work for this system, but OS X doesn't have the New York 18 font so the game just keeps telling you to install it. Apparently, you can get this font from OS 9, but why would I buy an older operating system for just one font! This is very frustrating because the game is useless! The packaging should not list OS X as an acceptable operating system. My son and I are both very disappointed!Unfortunately, the price I paid isn't worth the hassle of trying to return or else I definitely would!"
2,Oregon Trail (OT5),"Delivery of product from Amazon was good as was the purchase price.OT5 required a font that was not in my computer's file. It required New York font and it would not run the program until I found an online copy of New York and downloaded it. That took over 30 minutes! So now I could play the game, I thought! Not so fast - the sound both of the music and the characters voices are very poor. There is much oral ""drop out"" when a character speaks or the background music is playing.I'm not certain as to whom to contact - Amazon ? or TLC (The Learning Company).The sound problem makes the game impossible to play. Very disappointing quality control."
2,Couldn't get it to work,"I installed this game without any problems, but when I went to start a new game the program just crashes with an unexpected error. I'm using Windows XP and my computer is only a few years newer than the game itself, but I can't seem to get it to work. Strangely enough, I was able to get a 1993 version by MECC to work just fine."
1,MAC NOT COMPAITABLE,does not work with mac os lion. i don't know what to do in order to fix this. i don't want to put a rating but since i had to i can't rate it anything but 1 star bc i can't even play it.
1,Warning!! Does not always run under XP,"I've tried this program on 5 different Windows XP computers, and it only runs on one of them. And, yes I have done all the compatibility adjustments.This is criminal that the software company just doesn't fix this and distribute a patch for all of us that have a child that really wants to run the program."
1,New York 18 font - WILL NOT WORK,"Anyone purchases this game to play on a new Mac - system OS10 an above should be aware that this game will be useless to you. The system requires the font New York 18 to run. It is impossible to find and download this font on the internet, and unless you have access to the OS9 system disks, you will be very frustrated and waste much time. I took my laptop to the Apple store and they were able to download the font from an internet site that I have since been unable to find. However, once installed, the game is skippy and the audio sped up. I am sooooo frustrated and unhappy. This was a great game, and I need it for my fourth grade Oregon Trail unit. This information is not stated when you purchase this game - so I hope this post can get moved to the top of the list. IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO FIX THIS ISSUE (please don't say Google New York 18 - been there - done that - for hours) I would appreciate the help so much. Sueadel@me.com"
1,Does NOT work on Mac OS X!!!,"This program does NOT work on the newer Macs! It requires an older font that is not included on the OS X operating systems, nor can you buy it or download it anywhere - Basically, you need an older operating system to copy it from - Going to call MAc in the morning, but as of now, looks hopeless - Give it a quick google search to see the complaints for yourself - Wish I had before buying it!PS - Nor can I get it working on my older PC that runs Windows XP - It starts up, then gives me an operation error & shuts down - Sad for such a educational game that the kids love playing."
2,Just a warning...,I'm having problems with this game working on my computer. I use Windows 7 and I have a large flat screen computer monitor and I'm not really such which one is causing the problem. It's as if the game doesn't fit the screen correctly and I can not find a way to modify it. Perhaps some who are more computer savvy would know a way to fix that but I'm at a loss.
3,eh...,well i always liked oregon trail when i was younger and prob still like it today but it wont install properly on my computer so....not sure how i like it.
1,Don't order through Learning Company,"I tried to order this through on-line download directly from Learning Company/Broderbund. Their downloads did not work, no matter how many times I tried to install their ""smart download"" software. Their customer service is not available outside of business hours, and are rude when you do reach them. Maybe a CD via Amazon merchants would have been a better idea...."
1,The Oregon Trail %th Edition,"Upon downloading it to my computer, I could only got to Step I, and could not play the game at all. This is the reason for the low scores on my review of the game. How would I go about returning this product?"
4,Rancilio Silvia espresso,"This machine is easy to use. However since this is the only espresso machine I have used, I cannot compare it to its competition. It only takes several minutes for the water to come to the proper temperature and the espresso produced is very good. I would recommend it to anyone!"
4,"Great Machine, but takes practice, patience and lots of Beans","Great machine, but don't expect to take it out of the box and be pulling great shots the same day. I was a little cocky after using my Starbucks Batista for a couple of years and could pull amazing shots consistently. It took at least 50-75 try's before I made an acceptable espresso with the Rancilio and needed to get out a screwdriver and wrench to decrease the pump pressure before it happened (easier then it sounds, instructions in the manual). The rap with the Rancilio is you almost need to be a professional to pull great shots consistently. If you're looking for the easy road spend $3000 for a think-free machine or drive to a good coffee shop. If you are looking to master a craft, Rancilio will force you to study beans, grinds, tamper techniques, etc. Very rewarding once you get the hang of it..."
3,Enjoy it while it lasts,"This machine makes good coffee and is easy to operate. The machine worked very well for about 18 months and now is leaking water from base and does not make coffee. I have contacted JL Hufford (the seller) which advertised a 2 year warranty for the product on their website and their customer service rep couldn't tell me if my machine was under warranty or not because they ""may offer only 1 year warranty on amazon"". Further more she had no answers about the repair cost, turn around time and who is responsible for shipping fees. Their technician handles customer questions mentioned above trough email and he responds at will (no time frame)."
4,Satisfied,"After reading the (mostly) glowing reviews of this machine on this and other sites, I decided to buy it to replace a six year old Brugnetti Simona now relegated to weekend cabin duties. I'm very pleased with this machine. It produces more crema (consistently) than the Brugnetti and the steamer seems a little more powerful. I purchased it in conjunction with a Gaggia grinder that has made a big difference. Highly recommended."
3,espresso made difficult,I drink espresso for 20 years that i made at home with consistent texture warmth and head.the rancicilio has me rankled. I have had it for 2 weeeks .The coffee is inconsistent even with the same grind and sometimes is cool rather than hot.I have produced a good cup 25% of the time and i am a tech savvy person.I am buying a better tamper and a grinder to see if consistency is going to appear.I think there must be trick i have not dicovered.A better manual?or a liitle espresso guy.
4,satisfied customer,"We bought other product and found this one to be the easiest,fastest and most reliable espresso maker"
2,Not what I expected.,"I have owned the Gaggia Glassic for years, and have owned the Rancilio Rocky Burr Coffee Grinder, which is excellent, so I decided to try the Rancillio Silvia Espresso Machine. However, after every brew, I find water under the tray (and it is not full) and if not dried each time, it then leaks onto the counter. Maybe it's defective. Also, the portafilter spreads the coffee too far apart so if you are only making one cup, you have to hold it up to the spouts so a not to lose the brew. Finally, I think the switches are counterintuitive - you press on the top of the switch to turn them on, and on the light at the bottom to turn them off. The espresso it produces and the foam for cappuccino that it makes is excellent, however because of the above, I'm not sure I would buy it again."
3,Ranchio Silva,"I've had my Rancio Silva for over 3 years and I am very happy with it. I feel that it makes great cappucino. It foams the milk really good once you have developed a technique. The secret of getting good crema, ( foam on the top of the coffee.) is choosing the correct grind"
5,exellent!,"I just got my new machine from the box. It has a white protective coating that may be scratched, giving the appearance of it being used. Upon contacting the good people from ""wholelattelove"", they helpfully instructed me on how to remove such plastic linning. The machine looks very good. Solid stainless steel.Best part, COFFEE FROM HEAVEN."
4,"Possibly the best Machine in it's price range, takes practice to use!","Silvia is a great machine..... I was making very good shots right away. She is very finicky about grind and packing. I had to break down and order the Rocky Grinder, hopefully this will help with making consistent shots. Silvia is definately a high maintenance girl, definately only for the serious espresso drinker. Temperature surfing makes for better shots, but it is time consuming and a bit annoying. I guess it it's worth it, in place of spending $2000 or $3000 on a better machine."
5,Love it,"Super machine. Does great jom in making coffee, boiling water, frothing milk. Had La Pavoni before-waist of money and time. Rancilio- way to go. Highly recommend.Fast, efficient, durable."
2,Beautiful machine but has mechanical problems,I bought this machine for our small company of 18 people. The machine made a great cup of coffee for about a month and now no longer heats. Apparently the heating element is no longer working. I owned coffee bars in Manhattan and all of my machines were Ranchilio. These machines were workhorses making 100's of cups per day from each 2 group machine. I am very disappointed in this machine. It is under warranty but no one will come to fix it. You must send it out. I would discourage anyone from buying this product. It has turned out to be a royal pain in the a---.
4,This machine makes exceptional coffee.,"The Rancilio Silvia is definitely a coffee maker to consider. The coffee drinks that can be produced with it are superior to many machines - never sour or bitter when the right amount of beans are used and they are tamped properly - and it makes great micro-foam.Other qualities to be appreciated are its heaviness, good looks, quiet operation and metal steam wand. If you are looking for great results at home then the machine must have a burr grinder of a similar standard. When the grind is right before brewing then I believe it's down to using beans that have been roasted within weeks, not months!Silvia is a great machine and probably the cheapest entry into the semi-professional units and when you get all the variables right she makes exceptional coffee. Where the fun of this unit comes is that it takes some skill and experience to get the best results and once you get the hang of this you will see this is a great coffee machine."
3,NOT WORTH THE PRICE,"I agree that this machine makes a great, delicious cup of espresso. However, for a machine this price there are corners the company cut that they shouldn't have. The part of the machine that the basket fits into looks stainless but in fact is plastic - and the paint peeled off about 2 years in. Also, the paint on the bottom of the machine all peeled off. The decal on the steamer - that looks stainless - is plastic and fell off. These don't affect the taste of the espresso, but the machine starts to look beat up after a couple years - and I treated it well. The boiler stopped working after four years, which might be my fault since I didn't descale all that often. The Rocky Rancillio grinder is great - still working and looks good. i won't be buying another Rancilio. I'm going with Gaggia, which didn't last forever but didn't fall apart looks wise."
2,Wild Temperature Swings,"Miss SIlvia is one finicky machine. She's built like a tank, but the boiler is woefully small. It cannot maintain the temperature for even a standard shot run even though the selling point is that it's made of brass. I start the shot right after the light goes out and moments later the light is back on again. You have to be incredibly attentive and obsessive to get the right temperature - too much work! Google temperature surfing Silvia and you'll see. DO NOT BUY. Get a breville DOUBLE boiler - talk about temperature stability! Expensive, but well worth it. I've had the Breville for 3 months now - every shot perfect. Beautiful and dependable with great warranty and service network."
3,"Good quality, not user friendly","I can make good lattes with this machine, but it may frustrate you if you are not patient. It takes a lot of trial and errors before you can achieve an ok quality espresso. If you plan to make cappuccinos for you and your spouse it's ok, but if you plan to use it when you have a party at your house, you will be disappointed, it will take you forever to make a lot of lattes. I am enjoying my Silvia, but I wish it could be easier to use. If you don't have a grinder already, you need to add about $350 for the grinder to the price of the Sylvia."
4,Rancilio Silvia Expresso 2009 V#,This machine is a good machine. You need to play with your grinds (need a good burr grinder). A good tamper makes a big difference also. The frothing is no big deal. I've done frothing once or twice. Lost my patience. Maybe I'll get better with practice.
4,THE MULTI-TALENTED'S EXPERIENCE OF DOUBT & SHAME,"Ms. Taylor's book is as needed now as it was in 1999. Fortunately a lot of attention has been paid to making places wheelchair accessible, etc. but this book really brings the shame and doubt of hidden disability into the spotlight. A ""hidden disability"" and piece of shame that wasn't addressed, though, is the kind people feel who can't 'settle down and do just one thing.' ..."
5,A very useful source for getting away from ignoring pain.,"I have spent sizeable chunks of my life in guy mode, ignoring pain that was gradually taking over more and more of my life. I was pleased to pick up this book, which spoke clearly about the issues and pain I had been going through and provided very useful help with managing the symptoms and, probably more importantly, the people in my life. Kudos also for the web sources provided at the end of the book, which are pointing me to ways to discuss (finally) my pain with my doctor and others. I'd strongly suggest this book to anyone thinking about the way they are managing anything from constant minor aches to more significant sources of pain in their lives."
4,Book quality.,"For its price, the book Forgotten Truth by Huston Smith is more than acceptable.Forgotten Truth: The Common Vision of the World's Religions"
2,A disappointment,"I expected a dispassionate description of the beliefs of the major world religions and an elucidation of what they have in common. It is, however, mostly a rant against science and materialism."
3,Less satisfied,"This dock was purchased to be used wiht the Pirate Ship. While the ship is definitely heavy duty - ready for play, the dock set seems flimsy by conmparison, It is not well constructed and pieces seem to disconnect, making it a frustrating toy for a child. It is an excellent Idea but not well executed in my opinion, I don't believe the manfacturer is supplying this any longer, Perhaps they are trying to redsign."
4,Awesome toy,"Just like the ship this is a great old school toy for boys and girls. Built well and easy to fix when needed. You have to be handy with wood things to maintain toys like these. Our son broke the mast on the ship. A new dowel, drill and some stain and fixed! All the parts can be found in any hardwear store. To build something like this would take lots of time and money. A great deal for those who want to build but rather have fun playing with your children instead. They do collect dust (not from lack of play)so when not in play I cover them with a cloth. Our son loves his pirate ship and dock I'm sure they will be in his room till he has kids to hand them down to. Timeless toys that stimulates the imagination!"
4,Tremendously valuable as a reference for document design.,"I read selected portions of Karen Schriver's book on document design. This is an excellent resource for those needing confirmation of design decisions or for those wanting guidance. I paid particular attention to the examples and the reviews of the impact of design and text choices. Some may be put off by parts of the book that are very academic; however, this is overshadowed by the practical information for ""communications architects"" (a phrase Ms. Schriver has coined to describe those of us who are both writers and designers of documents)."
1,Terribly wordy - lots of deadwood,"Sorry - I would not recommend this book to a TECHNICAL writer.This book has 559 pages and could be cut down to maybe 100 pages of useful information. Each chapter has a full page explaining the chapter... if you have to do that, you haven't planned and written the chapter well. A good product sells itself.It takes the author 5 pages in the preface to explain the book! It also has a lot of side head paragraphs explaining more... explaining the explanations. This book was painful reading for me... I kept thinking ""bla bla bla bla bla""This book seems to have a lot of the author's opinions and theory, but not very much practical information."
1,What a waste. Avoid it!,"I'm so disgusted with this book I probably cannot compose this review properly. Please bear with me.While the content of this book is appallingly poor the design of the book as a document overall is not without irritating faults, as she wastes too much time outlining what she's going to tell us without actually telling us. Frequently she refers us to figures that are so far removed from the text that you spend a ludicrous amount of time searching for them (no, she doesn't even always include page numbers).The entire book is in such a stilted style that I expected the book to have been written circa 1972, not 1997. Example (page 136): 'PacMan was an immeadiate ""hit"" with boys and girls...'I shall now examine Amazon's return policy to see if I can reclaim my money for this book. I wish I could reclaim the couple of hours it wasted."
2,Not what the title explains,This book could be cut off to more than half pages it is now. The information is over explained and reader gets bored.Better luck next time!
1,Does not protect from germs!,"I bought this for my daughter because it was the only one they had available at Target at the time, but I soon learned that I had wasted my money. Like other reviewers said, it does not fit most shopping carts. It also leaves the sides of the cart completely exposed, which unfortunately happen to be my daughter's favorite spot to put her hands. My daughter did like the little toys, especially the ones that make sounds, but this product is completely worthless if you're looking to protect your little one from the filth and germs on shopping carts. At this moment, I am here searching for a better cover."
2,not much use if it doesn't cover the side of the cart,Not as easy to put on the cart as I thought. I returned this one after first use when my child had his mouth on the side of the cart where it was not covered. YUK!
2,Not a one-person job...,"Once my son grew out of the infant seat, I wanted something to hold him in the shopping cart to keep him amused and protect him from germs. This isn't it! First of all, it's impossible to install while holding a child. There's a series of little velcro tabs that need to be wrapped around the back and front that are hard to manage one handed. The seat belt doesn't fit through the back of a standard shopping cart if yours (like my grocery store does) has one of those ad placards on the back of the seat. Alternately, the seat belts that come on the grocery cart don't fit through the holes on the cart cover. After all that, if you do get it all set up and your child inside, the sides of the cart are left open to germs. When all my friends said ""buy a Floppy"", I thought this would be a better alternative because of the toys and storage - we're buying a floppy for Christmas. What a waste"
1,I agree,I agree with the others; this thing is such a hassle and doesn't even do anything. Get something else.
1,Not for big babies,"This is a really cute product, but not practical at all. I have had 3 big boys (ages 4 to 6 mo.) and none could sit in this without pulling the velcro off. Not secure and doesn't cover all surfaces. Very disappointing for such a cute cover."
1,Don't bother - buy the expensive one!,"This thing is a joke. It slips all over the place and the toys were lost in the first week - he just yanked 'em off and tossed them when I wasn't looking. Plus, it doesn't cover the sides - I don't know about your kid but mine has a thing for chewing on EVERYTHING, including shopping carts. This didn't keep him from doing that - he just gnaws on the sides instead of on the handle. Yuck. Spend the extra $15-25 and get the big one that goes over the whole cart."
4,I like it!,I really like this product. I have an 8 month old and it is great. we use it in high chairs at restaurants too. It has lots of fun toys that attach to it and my son loves them.
3,NOT SO BAD,I bought the Farm and Play because it was half the price of the all the other ones I looked at. We started using it when my daughter was 6 months old. She was almost sitting independently but not quite and the pea pillow kept her upright. I have read other reviews saying the toys weren't detachable. All you have to do is unvelcro it from itself. I haven't had any problems with it fitting into carts. I take her to costco with me and we have no problems. The only bad part is it doesn't cover the sides but I put my purse on the side she is leaning towards and she can't get to the side. Also in Colorado they are putting antibacterial wipes next to the shopping carts so I wipe it down anyway. I think it is very easy to travel and wash. It rolls up and velcros for the car. The front cupholder is a waste of time though. I just attach toys to it.
3,should be adjustable for different size carts,"We received this item as a gift, and initially thought it was great. However, I quickly realized that it doesn't fit a lot of shopping carts. Many stores now have carts that have a larger distance between the handlebar and the seat, with cupholders in between, and this cover will not fit them. Also, the velcro squares that hold the cover in place are not strong enough and come apart frequently - snaps would have been better. This cover also does not cover the sides of the cart seat, so if your child tends to hold onto the sides for support, you will not be as germ-free as you hoped."
1,Not worth the money,I bought this shop and play because it seemed like a great product to keep little hands and a little mouth off of dirty shopping carts. The product covers very little of the cart. Also the padding is very thin and doesn't add any comfort to the seat. The toys hang too low in the front for the baby to reach. I would recommend getting a Floppy seat instead. I would not recommend this infantino product.
1,Difficult to use,"I thought this would be a great item - a tummy time mat while the baby was really little, and then shopping cart cover when he was older. As a tummy time mat it was ok, though it was annoying how the velcro stuck to the carpet.But as a shopping cart cover, it's useless! You can use the strap around the baby as a seat belt, or feed it around the cart, but it's difficult to do both. It doesn't fit over the handles of all shopping carts. The snack cup flops over and won't hold a thing. The pea pod backrest is cute, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about this item.There are a lot of other shopping cart covers that are a lot easier and faster to use. Skip this one."
2,Doesn't fit carts,"This cart cover does not fit any carts that I've used it on and when I put my daughter in it, the velcro comes loose. I wouldn't recommend."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this one because it was cheaper than the others and I thought there couldn't be much dfference. WRONG! It didn't fit on any carts so it slid all over the place, and the toys were too easy to pull off. I returned it and plan to buy one with elastic."
1,Save your money,"This cover is very poorly designed. The padding is worthless and provides no cushioning to prevent the metal digging into my baby's chubby thighs. It's very cumbersome to attach all the velcro to make it stay in place, and then it's too narrow and doesn't cover the sides. The cup holder in the front doesn't grip anything. I don't know why it's even there. Now I use the EZ Carry Floppy Seat. It's much better and covers even Costco-sized carts with plenty of cushioning. I'd rather buy a home-made cart cover on E-bay than throw money away on this one again."
1,Useless,"I really do not see the need for this product. Honestly, what is the point? Ok, so you don't want your precious baby (which I have three) to ever touch a dangerous surface? Let me the first to tell you, children eat bugs and dirt when you aren't looking. So protect them from all of those terrible germs in a shopping cart but they will find a way to defeat your best efforts.Save yourself the time, money and energy and accept the fact that WE (as adults) survived shopping carts, dirty sandboxes, bugs, playgrounds, etc. and survived. Boost their immune system and stop giving in to marketing pressure. Your baby will be just fine without such junk. The only thing they NEED is YOUR attention. Trinkets dangling from a protective cover is just plain silly. *sigh*"
5,A great intellectual friendship and a tragic end,"This is the story of a friendship between two of the most remarkable intellectual figures of the twentieth century , Gershom Scholem and Walter Benjamin. It begins in Berlin in 1914 and continues through their separation until Benjamin's tragic death twenty -five years later. Both of them were greatly interested in the historical processes of their times, in philology , in the meaning of signs and symbols, in Socialism, in Zionism. Scholem left Germany for the Jerusalem of pre- state Israel and became a central figure there in the development of the Hebrew University. He became too the great scholar who opened a new field that of Jewish Mysticism. Benjamin hesitated and seemed to always find the way to misfortune. But their conversation and their friendship illuminates fundamental issues of life and thought. This book should be read by everyone for whom the life of the mind is important."
1,Not too sharp!,Not sharp enough to trim my mustache or provide a line on the front of my scalp. My work for longer hair.
2,Received a used product,"The clippers had hair trimmings and dust on them. The only reason I did not give it one stars is because I did not use them. They might have worked fine, but i returned them for a refund."
5,Thank You!,"I have used this only once, I have been cutting my son's hair to avoid $12 payments.Will see how it goes."
1,Disappointing,"I had to buy a new one because that one had no power, didn't work for me at all. I wanted to returned but I found out that would be as expensive to buy some new oneas and I didn't want to deal with all they restocking charges and policies."
3,unhappy,2 of the 4 trimmers were broken. still waiting for replacements. we mailed them back last week. very unhappt
4,Amazingly Quiet,"Very nice, very quiet, snips like a dream. Doesn't cut quite as close as I thought it would."
3,So-so,I was looking for a professional trimmer. And well let's just say u get wat u paid for. If your looking for one for home use this should be OKAY but not greatFor a professional.
2,Trimmer review,"They are very quiet, but they are not very sharp. I use these trimmers for shaving and I have to apply a lot of pressure to account for the dullness."
5,Best Trimmer,"The Oster T-Finisher trimmer is the best trimmer I have ever owned.Very quiet operation, sharp blades that trim very close, and Amazon has the best prices with fast shipping!!!"
2,good while it lasted. work for first 5 min and then kaput,"As the title indicates, the brand new product lasted for 5 mins only. After that it was dead as a brick.I gave two stars because the product performed really well when it was working."
5,Quite and close and excellent value.,I have been looking for a trimmer to replace my old clippers. This is just what I needed to keep the 5 o'clock shadow look.
4,Does The Job,Got it for shaping up and trimming. it hasn't let me down yet. a superb product and recommended for people in need of the same use!
4,My kids love it,I highly recommend this product. It does very smooth cut with irritating your skin.Remember this a a trimmer not a shaver
5,Outstanding!,"This trimmer cuts very close and is quite powerful. Only con is that it is sometimes too sharp, it will prick the skin if pushed too hard at the wrong angle. Be careful in the sensitive areas! Otherwise, works like a charm."
5,"Excellent, as advertised Oster Trimmer","The Oster T-finisher Trimmer is an excellent, durable product. The speedy delivery is greatly apreciated. Pleasure doing business with you."
5,This book is a blast!,"We discovered this book at the Museum of Science. It's a blast! We featured the Got Plastic? recipe on our local cable TV show. It's so simple. Cow's milk and vinegar, heat it up, squeeze out the moisture and you made casein. When I was sharing this story with an elderly gentleman he told me his mother used to make casein buttons when he was a child.Best health always,SuperMom101[...]"
2,Pretty basic,"This is probably quite appropriate for someone in middle school science, but less so for for those you are interested in ""off the grid"" techniques."
4,Pretty good book,"This book is great for anyone interested in tinkering around and learning new and creative uses for things. A couple projects are a bit dated like the video tape rewinder, but over all interesting read."
1,Just don't,"This book blows, it's got a nifty title but really there isin't anything in here that you would actually do. I do have one sneaky use for this book though toilet paper!"
2,Short on Everyday Things,"While the uses that are found in this book are plausible, most are minor and not really what is advertised. Most are everyday things, but you have to have a lot of non-everyday things to complete the project."
2,Kinda Silly,"This book is a fun to read book, yet do not expect to be able to make real items with it."
3,Not The Best Book,I personally thought it was okay but some of these things aren't everyday things. I would not recommend this book if you are a MacGyver fan (which I faithfully am) because you don't just find a X-10 Universal Powerflash Interface lying around in any ordinary house.(P.S. the battery trick made out of coins was pretty cool but the drawings look like they're from a 3-year old.)
2,Sneaky Uses for Everyday Things,Nothing great...was hoping for some totally unique things. Good for your middle school aged child who might want to do something other than play video games on a Saturday morning.
4,My kids like this book,"Both kids (a boy and a girl) liked this book so much that they each asked for ""Sneakier Uses"" for Christmas the next year."
4,Fine experiment book for kids,The things made and done in this book of creative useage for common materials are mind opening and touch on many science principals in a friendly manner. Learning something painlessly is a reward that is a byproduct of fun projects
1,Not worth it,"I bought the book for $3 and it may have been too much. If you were awake during 3rd grade science class you have already seen these ""sneaky"" things. Most of it is common sense, for instance, this gem:Use ordinary objects as ""sneaky"" weapons:You can throw a handful of coins at an attacker's face to stun and throw him or her off balance.And believe it or not they have an illustration (see figure 1) just in case you forgot how to throw a handful of coins. What a magnificent ""sneaky"" weapon."
3,"The Sneaky, Sneakier and Sneakiest uses Trilogy.","This review is for all three books in this series. The first note is they are clearly written for the 13 year old and under crowd. For them, it should stimulate the creative scientific gene in them, and open their imaginations to harmless scientific experimentation. So if there is a young burgeonoing, tinkering youngster in your life, these books could be the spark to spur them into some educational fun."
2,Macgyver's source book,Great value book - highly recomended for science teachers.Will have to get the other books. Solving problems and working with what you have can realy help you jury rig your way out of problem.
2,"Sneaky Uses for Everyday Things: How to Turn a Penny into a Radio, Make a Flood Alarm with an Aspirin, Change Milk into Plastic,","Sneaky Uses for Everyday Things: How to Turn a Penny into a Radio, Make a Flood Alarm with an Aspirin, Change Milk into Plastic, Extract Water and Electricity ... a TV with Your Ring, and Other Amazing Feats"
2,Terrifying Absence of an Editor,"I knew I was headed for trouble when I found that the jacket materials of her book have defined this author to be the preeminent authority on terrorism today--a preposterously inflated claim, and irresponsible to boot in these uneasy and confusion fraught times. Equally disturbing is the quality of the writing, as awkward as that of a marginally capable graduate student and so strikingly in need of extensive editing as to put in question the legitimacy of the publisher. Certainly an important topic. We simply need a first-rate book on it."
2,A bit jumbled,"I caught an interview with the author and was not convinced by her nervous and jumbled words. Now, most people have a problem with public speaking, so I wasn't willing to discount the book simply because of a poor author interview. I found the book to be similar to both interviews I've heard from Stern: jumbled content. Perhaps the book was hastily finished due to the times, but I simply can't recommend it."
1,Save your money,"More money being made on 9-11. There is a disconnect between true discourse and the race to get rich before Americans realize that 9-11 was precursor to the 21st century's own bogus cold war. Russia had no ability to do much of anything to us, we now know that. The oil politicians allowed us 9-11."
4,Very Well Made Hardcore,"Great album simply put. Like Hardcore or Metal? Ull like it, so pick it up and give a listen, its very worth while if you like Madball or Hatebreed"
5,head banging good hardcore,this cd rocks hard and never stops.a good buy for a real hardcore tough guy metal selection.
4,TERROR,"I was in Hot Topic and I had just gotten out of jail a few hours before when I saw this CD. I listened to it for about 30 seconds and decided to buy it. Needless to say, it was worth the full $11.99 that I spent on it. It is a great hardcore cd that anyone who likes real hardcore is sure to appreciate. Pick it up!"
1,WON WID DAH UNDERDAWGZZ,"Wen i bouht dis cd i thought is waz my holmes on it but it was jus sum dude wid a big azz hoodie and hat. when i put dis in my playa it was broken the rappers, main peter, voice sounded liek a blender. dah turntables sound like my moms bong a bubblin damn nigga was my favorite track but that wasn't on dis cd. I wish i had da real copy and not da malufunked up one. peace out dawg KEEP IT REAL AND STAY WON WID DAH UNDERDAWGZZZ"
4,"Doesn't surpass ""Lowest""..","This is a solid album for the capabilities of Terror. It's put together well and the breakdowns are still in-your-face. The only thing I didn't like was that since this album came out on Trustkill, all these people are saying they're metal-core, which pisses me off, but anyways..this is an alright album but it's not as good as Lowest of the Low."
3,Decent,"This album is average and pretty catchy. If you want to get away from Gaybreed, give this an ear. 6/10"
2,Boringly average,"This book is like many others from the same publisher, a monochrome monotony of pictures of young men - although beautiful young men in well arranged posed photographs. I whish the publisher would have taken the opportunity to add some color pictures as well as different scenery or just a little pizzaz.I can only say: Once you've seen one - you've seen them all."
5,Ashanti remixed.,"This is the UK cd single for the huge ""Rock Wit U(Awww Baby)"" track. The cd comes with 3 remixes plus the original radio version. The Taz & Vangard remix(4:24) and the J.D. Remix(3:54) are R&B/hip hop in the vibe. The Taz & Vanguard mix features a new rap by Taz while the J.D. mix features vocals by UK group member J.D. aka Dready from the So Solid Crew. Each are equally good. The highlight of the cd is the Jay Hannan Lazy Dog Mix(6:30) that is pure heaven. The house vibe with a deep heavy live bass is a great counterpoint to Ashanti's sweeter vocals. When the male voice states ""Let's Rock"" and the house music kicks out it is a thing of sheer beauty. It is a R&B /Soulful type house mix. A+++++ remixing."
5,Backing Plate is Good,"Well you have to use a backing plate anyway, and this is it.This plate has the loop hook velcro type fasteners, so all you do is put your pad against it and go. Pad will not come off until you remove it yourself. I use the mequiars pads and other makes will most likely work if they have the velcro surface. Built extremely well, good for many years of constant use.Fits your typical polishing tool arbor connection.Worth every cent."
3,Art and Science of Leadership (4th Edition),Overall good book on the topic; covers quite a lot of material. Not as thorough as it could be on topics such as MBTI but sufficient material exists elsewhere. Too expensive for a paperback.
2,"obviously, it's for a required class","Otherwise there is no way I'd have bought a book like this. The quality of the book has nothing to do with it; it could be very well-written, but with a poor instructor or even a GREAT instructor who has too many students and limited time and budget, most people will get nothing from it. It's just another class to ""get through"" rather than learn from. I've tried classes both ways: reading to learn, and reading to pass. The second is what the college wants, and because I don't have time for both, it's what I do."
1,delivery slower than expected,The book was exactly what I ordered; however I was disappointed in the fact that it took 2.5 weeks to receive the book.
2,Blinky and miss it,"Regrettably this dates from the period when (as Silvers confesses) he was the hero's best friend who never gets the girl, even when it's his idea ""why not do the show right here"".His glory days as Sgt. Bilko still lay ahead of him. Then the scripts would be frequently brilliant and the comedy performances fabulous. Here, the material is thin, dated, and the limited humour relies largely on star name-dropping, and will be of little interest to most new listeners.Let's hope the 50s TV shows get a DVD release soon, so we can remember him as he deserves to be remembered."
4,Variety,"This book is good for both new and experienced crocheters. There are lots of different projects to choose from, but only one or two styles of each. There are great gift items, too."
3,A humourous yet poignant look at how Anger affects the family,"Simply put. She is funny but she does not ignore the damage that anger can have. I like the ""self-help"" questions at the end of each chapter."
4,Saw it on Oprah,"I saw Mrs. Barnhill and several other ladies on a recent Oprah show. I ordered the book here at amazon.com but wondered if it would be one of those preachy ""I have no problems now,"" books.Well, it's not. And while I wouldn't consider myself a Christian Mrs. Barnhill's take on being a mom, being frustrated, being tired, being a ""good"" mom, and then ending up being a mother from Hell. . .well, I could relate to that!She bravely offers up painfully honest stories that show that she really did battle anger as a mom. A few (few) of the things she suggests (and she admits) aren't necessarily ""You've Never Heard of This!"" type stuff. But rather, things that we need to be reminded of time and time again.What I enjoyed the most was a section in which she instructs Moms to ""let it go."" Let it go when it comes to perfectionisim, and schedules that are crazy. Let it go and find out where your anger is coming from and relearn how to deal with hot emotions in a more balanced manner."
2,Bible Diver!,"This book was ok until (about) chapter 6-The Bedrock of Truth, exploring the Biblical foundations for change. I am Christian, go to church & love our services (all Bible based). AND, if I were able to resolve my parenting challenges by being more like Mary, I wouldn't have looked for a parenting book to help with behavoior issuses. I did feel this book totally bottomed out by referring us to the Bible instead of offering useful methods of resolving the constant triggers (screaming, hitting, fighting, not listening, etc.). I found another book that in the 1st chapter gave me one of the most useful tools I have found yet..it involves the ""uh oh"" song. My son is a Very Highly sensative boy with LOTS of energy, persistance & intensity. I didn't think there was ANY way he would respond to it, but spanking was my closest option (I felt) and I wanted to give it every effort before resorting to that. Best Wishes."
1,"Where is the ""real"" help!","When I bought this book I thought I might have finally found something that would give ""real"" help for dealing with anger. I'll admit the author is a good writer but I do not believe she offered ""real"" help. Her helpful hints were very broad. I know many moms deal with anger and the author does a good job of making them feel normal. However, this author basically admits to abusing her children and I hope readers don't get the impression that this is normal. Overall I felt this book was a waste of money."
2,Too Godly!!!,"The unrelenting references to the Bible and to Christianity turned me off completely. Even though I admire the author's honesty on this very intense subject, overall I was very disappointed. I feel that it is a waste of money for people not particularly interested in how a ""Christian Woman"" would deal with anger."
2,Offensive,"While there's certainly some valid advice on dealing with children (as in many other books), there's a clear fundamentalist Christian prosthelitizing element as well. She strongly advocates taking Jesus as one's savior. I wish the religious bent to this book had been apparent in the descripition since, for me, it gets in the way of respecting this writer as a thoughtful broadminded advisor."
2,Gimme A Break!,"I got about half-way through. I found it to be informative and helpful. BUT..........(you knew this was coming).......I could no longer stomach the religious aspect of the book. There were general undertones of it in the first half, which I could handle, but then, it came on full-strength. If I wanted to be preached to, I'd go to church."
1,I wish you could give it a rating of 0,"This book was a huge disappointment. If Jesus is your answer to everything then this is the book for you. However for those parents with intelligence and education it is insulting and condescending. I wanted actual help. Not saccharine urgings to put my faith in myths and stories. It didn't make me less angry. It made me more angry. However, it did validate my feelings of supierority as a person and a parent, so as far as that goes it almost helped."
5,Entertaining and a touch stone...,"It states clearly on the back cover of the book that Julie will discuss the bible and finding peace through God. ... Well that is the whole point of the book. If it has become 'offensive' to express your personal faith in your writing, then I guess we don't live in the United States, where freedom reigns? ... I found this book so helpful I sent several to my mom friends and asked them to pass them on to moms in their circles who might benefit."
3,Some helpful ideas,"3 1/2 - As a previous reviewer indicated, this book does have religious overtones and Julie encourages you to really lean on God in dealing with your anger. I am not a religious person, so I just overlooked those parts of the book and concentrated on the common sense ideas that she presented. I am an intelligent, college-educated mother and didn't find this book to be insulting or condescending. I would recommend this book to any mother looking for support and ideas in dealing with and disciplining her children. As with any advice you receive, you apply the principles that work best for you & your family."
3,I'd love it if it praying wasn't the author's panacea of choice,"I really enjoyed the author's honesty and I found it extremely helpful just to know I'm not alone. However, I am not a believer, so the relentless talk of God and praying for help/forgiveness/better furniture, was pretty hard to get past. I was forced to skip entire sections of the book. I understand that the author, being Christian, is merely being true to what she believes in and so I don't blame her for bringing her religion into it... but it was an annoyance that put a wedge between she and myself, making me less apt to care what else she had to say. The book wasn't a total waste of my time as I did gain some perspective. As I mentioned already, it was therapy in itself just reading her stories and discovering that I'm not alone."
2,There are better guides out there,"I read a few books about parenting anger and this one helped me the least. I think the book Imloved and that helped me the most was called "" Love and Anger""."
3,Some good advice,"Just like any other parenting book, you'll have to take what's helpful and leave the rest. I want to stress that I did find a FEW very helpful parenting suggestions in this book. If you're thinking about reading this book just be aware that it has a fairly strong religious tone. A great read for someone seeking faith- based parenting views. One to skip for someone who just wants a parenting book!"
4,Who are these guys?,I purchased this album after hearing a couple of their songs on a blog. At the time I couldn't find it anywhere in the US that carried it so I had to have it shipped from Sweden. I'm not the best at reviews so I'll just say it is a three star album with a couple 5 star songs so I averaged it out to 4.The best thing I can say is I've had this album for several months and I still listen to a couple of the songs on a regualar basis. It's unfortunate Amazon doesn't have any audio of these guys.
1,mmmm,very miss leading much smaller than i though. I was expecting 6 pots but turns out they count the lid as piece
3,mediocre masterpieces,"It wasn't that the set was bad, it just wasn't great. The tempo's taken were excelent and kept the musical line moving but the overall presentation needed work. This is mozart, not dvorak or stravinsky. Less schmoltz and more style. At times it felt as though the pieces were pushed into the romantic period. Overall it was just too much emotion in pieces where you aren't supposed to ""express"" yourself."
4,Extended Revelation for those without this album.,"After discovering TSOOL through the Behind the Music album , I decided to investigate further, and luckily for me, came across this gem. Its smart, clever and it influenced by the folkish elements of the late sixties.The band seem to be a lot more relaxed with this affair, as opposed to the faster and more urgent Behind the Music. This does not mean that this album is all laid back folky whimslings however. It is at times meaty, rocky and toe tapping but it retains a psychedelic aura that makes this album a supreme pleasure on the ears.Alikened to Kula Shaker, and also supporting them on tour, Crispian Mills (Kula Shaker's lead vocalist and guitarist) once declared the Soundtrack of Our Lives as the 'best band in the world ever', although this may be a little tounge in cheek, he does make the point that this band is very special, and hopefully one that can keep up its excellent musical past."
4,Extended Revelation,Extended Revelation being T.S.O.O.L's 2nd album and 1998 release. The album contains of 50% leftover material from their first album and 50% new material. Allmusic gave the album a positive review and awarded it the grade 4/5. I agree with this assessment and I also give this album 4/5. All the lyrics are included in the booklet and we get a nice photograph of the group in the center of the booklet. We get a list of their birthdates but not what instruments they play which in itself is quite odd. 4/5.
1,Very Disappointing,"The dry writing prevented me from getting excited about the subject. And at only 167 pages in flimsy paperback, this book is not worth the price it's listed for here at Amazon."
4,Great for begining writers!,"I purchased this book set because of the Natalie Goldberg connection, and since I wrote a thesis on her works, I like to keep up with her publications. Her card set is fun - but really if you want inspiration, copies of Wild Mind and Writing Down the Bones is a better choice.If you are new to the writing/publishing business, this is a well written book, with some good advise. If you are an old hand, you may find this too simple.However, if you are a giving a gift to a new writer, the packaging of the kit makes a great gift."
4,jeanette's review,My 6 yr. old and I have enjoyed the game so far. It is a difficult for him as he is a visually impaired child. But with my assistance he is doing ok. James is very much a Scooby fan. It was all I could do to talk him out of naming the new dog Scooby. We did name her after the Golden Retriever on Alian Invaders. I was very glad to see this game on the store shelves at Christmas and the price was good as well. We have yet to find a coin to play the game in the Pizza Parlor but I am confident we will sucseed. Thanks for the chance to voice my opinion.
1,Not for 5-8 year olds,I bought this software for my 5 year old who has 3+ years computer experience. Even at the easy level she had difficultities. I tried to work it but became easly discusted as it does not flow. I gave the CD's to a friend's daughter who is 8 1/2 and she said it is too hard so her brother who is 13 and a computer wiz and he did not like it. It is rated for a 5-10 year old. It makes no sense that software written for a 5 year old would satisify a 10 year old and vise versa.
3,"Okay, but won't keep attention for long",You get what you pay for....my kids enjoyed this and played it constantly for 2 weeks. Then they went back to Reader Rabbit which they have enjoyed for months.
1,Unfathomably Bad,"Harrison's a pretty good SF writer and Minsky is a leader in AI, so this seemed a good bet. Not so. The writing is wooden, mechanical and impersonal. All of the characters talk the same and we have to rely on the authors to tell us what each of them is like. Which often comes as a surprise. 15 years is a long time for any book that centers on computer technology, so one wouldn't expect this to have aged well. But consider: Heinlein's The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress is from 1962, this from 1992. Heinlein's book is fresh and thought provoking, this one is just boring. The computer ideas aren't really very interesting and, really, Minsky should have known better. So how can you have the right ingredients and have such a lousy result? I got this used and very cheap. It's still a waste of time. Alas."
2,"Too bad, it had potential","I picked this one up at a second hand book shop -- Harry Harrison and Marvin Minsky? Wow, how could I go wrong!Unfortunately, the ideas are not backed up by very solid storywriting here. Very little characterization is used, and the interaction comes across as somewhat dull and empty. None of the characters seem much to act realistically to what happens to them, except possibly Shelly, and Brian's personality never seems consistent.As for the ideas, most are predictable and very straightforward extrapolations. The mecahnics of the AI is interesting, but comes across at times almost as textbook lecture, and many of the other more interesting ideas are left undeveloped.Well folks, this is just my comments. Personally, I was disappointed somewhat by the book, but didn't consider it a collossal waste, either.Your Mileage May Vary"
3,"Too much Harry Harrison, not enough Marvin Minsky","This book had tremendous potential. Think of it - a fictional depiction of true artificial intelligence guided by one of the leading workers in the field, Minsky. Unfortunately, Harrison has a way of focusing on the evils of big government and the military. That along with a writing style which makes the gadgetry the central theme of the book - seemingly a trademark of Harrison - with the characters, tragically including the AI, just rather shallow bit players, seriously flawed my enjoyment of the story. I would really have liked a bit more insight into the world view of the AI and less excitement over it's supporting widgits. After all, widgits don't make a story, and they will likely be obsolete in less than two years anyway. People are what make a story, whether they're machines or the old fashioned kind"
1,I didn't wait long enough...,"I own this book. If you open the cover and look inside it says ""Christmas 1992. You better read this so I can borrow it."" Thirteen years later I took this book off my shelf, dusted it off, and read it. All I can say is, I didn't wait long enough. This book could have been pretty good. I kept expecting a twist or surprise that never happened. It just kind of plodded along and then ended. Granted, technology has been chugging along so maybe some of it felt a little dated. But the characters just didn't engage me at all. I even enjoyed Prey more than this book (I think I even reviewed it here at Amazon) and that says a lot. I guess I'll put this back on my shelf with the other hardcovers. Or better yet, I'll mail it to my friend and force him to keep his promise and read it. Why should I suffer alone?"
1,Thankfuly out of print,"This has to be one of the worst books I have EVER read. It is a shame because Minsky has some very good ideas, unfortunately this is not one of them."
2,Bad Graphics,"i bought it cuz i'm a huge spiderman franchise fan, but i was a bit disappointed on the graphics side....they're the WORST graphics out there.. i guess MARVEL was in a bit hurry to launch the game along with the movie......Buy it if you're a spiderman fan, but i'd not recommend it.....i have it with me, but m not playing it, never played at all =)"
2,BORING!!!,This game doesn't keep you interested in the plot line at all. It is extremely boring and I'm saddened at how poor it was. The only reason I give it a 2 overall is because the map is big and well-detailed.
4,A good game.,"I find this game a little to fast for me, I was used to Spiderman 2 and Spidy 3 is a good push to add more content and make more plot points, as well as explore New York, which I have always loved freeroam enviroments. Still a little to fast, the character is harder to control and get him to do what you want when you want him too, it takes a bit of luck off the start but overall a good game. Personally, you might as well (unless you're a collector like myself) go ahead and skip this one and get Web of Shadows, just as much fun and overall a better story in my book. Still the game is better than the movie (I'm sorry to say).Thanks for reading."
4,A good starting point...,"I found this book to be a comprehensive accounting of the developement of our highway system beginning with our very first national road and going thru to Boston's big dig. The book doesn't get bogged down with details, and has lots of good pictures. If you want a lot of information in a hurry, you'll enjoy this book.I've read several books on this subject, and this one is like the others in one regard: I'd enjoy reading more about the actual construction details- the unforseen problems, the mishaps and mistakes, the million other events that occur between groundbreaking and ribbon-cutting. Nonetheless, a good book, I enjoyed it."
3,Good book on the history of US roads,"The book is good and an easy read. I would have liked a more in-depth discussion of the interstate highway system. Its one of our most critical pieces of our infrastructure..would have been interesting to get a better sense for the issues that arose when laying out the interstate routes, etc."
4,Works well but to expensive.,"This is a must for the swiss-o-air humidifier, but they need to sell for a reasonable price."
3,tank leak after four months,"Tank began to leak where it is attached to base at the beginning of second season (fifth month). Called Air-O-Swiss customer service directly. Tank warranty....three months. Want granule replacement, not total cartrige replacement......out of stock. What does ""replace after one year"" mean? One season or twelve months. Response, ""one season"", (four months). ""Once the silverstick dries out, it is deactivated.""It was suggested that I use the heat option because it would sterilize the water.How hot does it get! Doesn't that use a lot more wattage?.........""No"" Actually it uses like three times more, and forget about sterilization.Can't handle a large room. But it is quiet,water lasts 12 hours, nice looking.Where can I buy Air-Swiss locally.....Central New York ?"
3,Probably won't replace it,"I have an Air-o-Swiss humidifier that came with one of these, but I don't think I'll replace it because it's ridiculously expensive.Both silver and copper have antimicrobial properties, so I know it does some good, but I think I'll try to clean it or replace it with maybe a dozen clean pennies before I shell out $30."
5,One of my Favorite Board Games,"This game provides very good brain teaser puzzles. The majority of the brain teasers are reasonable and fun to do -- The kinds of puzzles that either make you go ""Oh, I should have got that!"", or just make you feel good when you're successful. I personally like the shape puzzles the best. You are given a series of plastic shapes (squares & triangles) and have to put them together to create a larger shape -- deceptively simple.If you're into brain teasers this is a must have."
2,I did not like,"If you are looking for structured and useful ideas this may NOT be the best book on turnarounds. What I saw in this book? Lots of "" cases"" but few useful ideas to apply in my job."
2,"Great elements, but bad execution","This book's plot has a great idea of a story that I would love to read. Unfortunately, the book was a disappointment. It lacked the intense feelings or action that was needed to make this story better. It was light and sweet of THE IDEA OF everlasting true love, but it did not come to pass to provide us, romantic hopefuls, a good romance story. It had the right ingredients with the suggestion of magic, but the author failed to execute the story well. This story had so much potential if handled correctly."
2,"Silly, mediocre romance..","Abe's ""Truelove Bride"" shows that she is not quite ready for primetime yet. The ""warrior maiden"" heroine Avalon is overly whiny, and much too stubborn to be likable. She resists the idea of the curse a bit too much, and her desire to join a convent is not belivable for a minute. Marcus is more interesting, but comes across a bit too two-dimensional, as he is the stock ""trouble hero/hunk"". The villian is also underdeveloped, as we never learn her true motivations as Abe seems too afraid in get into her head."
1,Silly,"Avalon's resistance throughout became repetitious, boring, tiresom, and SILLY. Marcus was the only worthwhile element in this story. This was a very adolescent level story."
3,The Truelove Bride,"This has the outline of a good story, but it is 2-dimensional. With all the possiblities set up by the author, the characters fall flat and are uninteresting.For lovers of the ""steel blue eyes, the square jaw, the sardonic smile"" of the hero, and the ""uncontrolable trembling"" of the heroine, this might be just the thing, but for anyone who wants to get to know and care for the characters, this is a disappointment.I didn't finish it. I got bored. Sorry."
3,A book worthy of an afternoon,"I liked this book very much because of the Hero, Marcus. He is driven by a curse that states that he must marry a fabled warrior maiden. He and his clan find this mythical maiden in Avalon but she wants nothing to do with any of it. She tries continually to tell him that she's not the maiden in the legend. That her destiny is of her own making and that Marcus isn't apart of it. Soon though she finds herself drawn not only to him but his people. The struggle for her love and her passion drives Marcus on until they conquer each other.I enjoyed this book and look forward to others by the same author."
5,A Keeper!,"I don't usaully like books with mystical undertones. I don't usually like books about Scotland--there are so many. In spite of this being a somewhat mystical book, taking place in Scotland, I loved it! Beautiful writing combined with a wonderful hero,heroine, and I've found a surprise Keeper!"
4,Decent for the price,"This vise is about what you'd have to expect for twenty bucks. Fit and finish is mediocre, but it does the job of holding something securely while drilling. Definitely beats trying to use your hand! While this vise might not fit on all drill presses, it fit on my Rikon product since it has eight slots in the table. I can usually only get two bolts in, but that is more than enough to hold it in place. I use another, smaller vise clamped into this one when I need to hold rods vertically or other things more securely (since the other vise is much higher quality, but smaller capacity). Gives me a poor man's ""X-Y"" vise."
3,Delta 20-621 4-inch Drill Press Vise,"When used for square or rectangular stock, or to capture tubing securely, this vise works well. I have not had the same experience with bar stock: it seems, when the bar is held horizontally, that it is not possible to tighten the vise to adequately secure the material. I have also noted a tendency for the moveable jaw to fall out of square with small, off-center pieces of stock.Having said that, for the price, this is actually a serviceable little vise as long as it's limitations are understood and respected."
5,NICE LITTLE STARTER FOR A BEGINER. IT THOSE THE JOB..LUE FOR THE MONEY. VERY WELL MADE GOOD QUALITY.,GREAT FOR A BEGINER. IT THOSE THE JOB. BEST VALUE FOR THE MONEY. VERY WELL MADE GOOD QUALITY. WILL DO UNTIL BUY A BIGGER ONE.
5,Good Value,This popped up as a suggested accessory to the drill press I bought my husband for Christmas. He is very pleased with it. For the money it is an excellent value.
2,BOT THIS VISE IT WAS A POOR CHOICE,"(1) Need help. I am thinking about purchasing this vice for Mortise work. I have a Delta 8"" bench Drill press mod 11-950. For the life of me I cannot find the specs on this vise to see if it will fit. Distance between slots on the table bracket assembly (plate) is approx 4.5 inches. Any suggestions.Sal(2) What I got wasn't what was pictured. I cannot believe that this vise was sold being represented as a Delta Product which it was not. The casting was poorly manufactured and cast. The base was partially polished but clearly the entire bearing surface needed to be milled but was not as casting imperfections were present. This appeared to be a import knock off. I will credit the seller with calling me to answer my measurement question, but as far as a quality finished product, it definitely was not. The jaws of the vise had non-visible sharp metal shavings which got my attention in short order .In short this product is misrepresented .Sal"
1,Horrible build quality. Do not buy.,"The mold used in the sand casting of this turd was so off that large portions of the functional surfaces that get milled for accuracy were simply untouched. The flat-head screws holding the jaws in place are stripped and protrude from the clamping surfaces by at least .030"", so that the jaws close on the screw heads instead of on the poorly painted flats. As in there's a very noticeable gap when the vice is ""closed"", and if you try to clamp anything wider than 2 inches you'll be pushing screw heads into your part.This is going into the recycling bin as soon as I get something less embarrassing.I can only assume that the positive reviews were either lucky in getting a unit from a less horrible batch, or are out to trick me into buying garbage."
5,I bought this as a suggested item and it is great.,Using stand alone and with a skil drill press too - so far so good! Simple review for a simple device.
4,Solid Precision vise at a reasonable price.,"I have not used the vise on a drill press yet, but it seems to work smoothly and precisely. It's cleanly machined and defect free."
2,Its just OK...,"I bought this vice soon after I bought my drill press thinking it would be a much needed accessory. I was wrong! I think I have used this thing twice in five years...There is nothing wrong with this tool. The casting is heavy and the screw operates smoothly. The main issue is that it is a pain to attach to the drill press table and also a pain to make adjustments to once it is attached. Also, the jaws are a bit too narrow for a lot of what I might use the thing for...Basically its a bad idea that is really well made. If you can think of a good use for it, then by all means buy it for its quality and price - otherwise forget it."
4,"great figure, but vintage is better","This is a great version of Commander Cody, but it bears mentioning that there is a newer Vintage version (Star Wars 2010 Vintage Collection Action Figure Commander Cody). For whatever odd reason, it's not only better, but cheaper. The head on that one is also correctly proportioned."
4,Love my Birken,"I love my new shoes! I wore them right away but unfortunately after wearing them for long hours I found that they hurt my feet. At the time I wore them for more than 5 hrs... which I did not think was too much they felt heavenly when I put them on and I figured ""my feet have found their partner""! :) I still wear them just not when I have to be on my feet for long periods of time... but other than that I would recommend them."
2,"False Advertising, Not Leather!","I have just received my Birkenstock Gizeh Patent Leather sandals and you can imagen the disappointment when I opened the box to find they are not leather as advertised but PVC. I have Black Patent Leather Birkenstock and they are real leather, as far as I`m concerned this is a case of false advertising. Other than that they are as per normal Birkenstock`s."
5,Black Patent Birkenstock Gizeh,This is my third pair of Gizeh I also have them in metallic silver and pink. I love them. They are extremely comfortable. Just make sure you get the correct width when ordering. I am a size 7 and had to make sure I had the correct size when converting to europeon sizing.
1,Ugly as sin,"This photo is really nice of the shoe as in person, they are horribly ugly. Also, the black is super shiny patent leather, not muted like in the photo. Why wouldn't they make a matte black one anyhow? It baffles me). The photo is also deceptive as the strap over the foot is not down the middle but rather off to one side. Also, the leather digs into the foot and, unlike most Birks, it's not a comfortable shoe. That's a lot of coin for not so much of a shoe. Total bummer - needless to say, I returned it."
1,Upset and Disappointed,"I never recieve Item from Amazon.com.When I placed my order, I chosed the one day shipping for $3.99. I didn't recieve the item the next day or three day later. I contact Amazon.com about my order,and they couldn't tell me what happen to my order. I was so upset and disappointed,because I order from Amazon.com before and never had this problem. To make matter worst, while I was inquring about my order with customer service the call got disconnected. Take my advise choose standard shipping for your orders."
3,Terrible Tsarinas,Not quite as in depth as I'd hoped. It's very easy reading and definitely slanted to the authors thoughts. Really basically about Elizabeth. Couldn't wait to read more about the other Tzarinas and it never really got into them. Somewhat disappointing.
2,Take A Different Trip,"I really wanted to like this book. A beloved friend, who is a deep reader to sacred places, sent it to me with the highest of recommendations. I read it... and wondered what my friend saw. What I experienced was an egomanical traveler who was completely self-sunk, never too far away from a pen, and utterly enamored with his Hip Urban Self. The motivation for the travel story is poignant and heart-breaking, but the execution of the book is tedious and can't break the gravitational attraction of me, Me, ME. Answering my friend's question of ""How'd you like the book?"" was a nuanced conversation. Since my house is modest, and shelf space at a premium, I donated the book to a local library sale. Hopefully somebody bought it for a buck and found some wisdom. Or not."
1,Dreadful,"The Publishers Weekly review in my opinion says it all. The book is well and accurately characterised as pretenious, sophomoric and self-absorbed. Every one has experienced loss in their life. Little useful, sustaining or enlightening will be learned from this book. A big disappointment"
2,A mystifying dud from Boulez,"Pierre Boulez frequently returns to the repertoire that established him in the Seventies on the Columbia/Sony label. He made an acclaimed Symphonie fantastique back then, but this 1997 remake is mystifying. It's so inert, undernourished, and detached that one can't imagine the conductor had any interest in the performance. Yet every bar is under control, and the Cleveland Orch. plays suprbly, so boulez had something in mind. He isn't simply drifting. Did he want to bring out the classical side of an arch-romantic (Berlioz was a great admirer of Gluck)? If so, it was perverse to pick a work that demands color, atmosphere, and dramatic contrast, all the things utterly lacking here."
2,Look elsewhere for an exciting Fantastique,"Sadly, this recording is another unexciting miss in a whole series of unexciting misses issued by DG in their Boulez series.The playing of the orchestra is impeccable, but the interpretation itself just sort of sits there. There's no forward momentum, nothing eerie, spooky or - well - fanatastic about the proceedings.Textual notes: Boulez omits the cornet part in the second movement and observes the unwritten DC al segno repeat at the double bar in the 4th movement.Skip this and pick up the Maazel/Cleveland/Sony version instead. A absolute overlooked gem of a recording that is everything this Boulez recording is not, and in much better recorded sound.Kudos for coupling the rarity to fill up the CD, but nobody is buying this CD for that rarity."
3,Doesn't quite have it...,"For a long time I couldn't put my finger on why this performance really did not work in my opinion. The sound is very good, all the notes are in place, I respect Boulez as a musician and conductor and I generally like performances by the Cleveland Orchestra. I have come to the realization that it is missing the quirky rhythmic quality I associate with this symphony. Boulez really takes no chances and with this symphony that is a missed opportunity. The character is lacking and it is utterly devoid of emotion. There are a few moments of sparkle, but too few to mention. This performance, in my view, doesn't come close to Colin Davis/Concertgebouw on Philips or even Bernstein/Orchestre National de France on EMI. The filler piece by the way, Tristia, is much better on all counts but it is small consolation."
3,Solid Recording,"This recording displays the Cleveland Orchestra as it usually is: an extremely capable ensemble that plays just about every piece to perfection. But, in the case of Berlioz, the type of pinpoint precision the orchestra uses does not fully unlock the genius, beauty, and haunting effect of the Symphonie Fantastique. This is a program symphony, and the orchestra treats it as if it were absolute music. The players succeed as musicians, but with the music of Berlioz, the players forget they are on stage as actors as well."
4,Only one flaw,"This is an excellent recording. However, the Black Swan pas de deux is not in the where most companies place it. It seems buried in the middle, when it is usually the culmination of the third act. However, this is easily correctible in rehearsal and performance, and everything else is stunningly beautiful."
2,what was ozawa and boston thinking with this one,"skip this and get dutiot montreal synphony version it is way better in every way.the sound is pretty bad to.how any body gave this 4 or 5 stars is beyond me .to me its just a bland and empty performence,its like boston synphonys playing is like by the numbers or the notes .and this is my favorite composer and one of his greatest works of art,and one of my favorite works of his"
5,Strange in an excellent way...,"I really enjoyed this album, it's the Colleen album that everyone talks about when they talk about Colleen. Perfect music to play in the entrance/doorway of a hookah lounge or club. There's just enough to hang on to to make it not sound like noise if you're not trying to listen to it, just enough unconnectedness to bust your mind out of a funk. I highly recommend this to anyone who would consider listening to it. It's challenging in a fun way, especially to an experimental music newcomer."
1,Art disguise,1 1/2Shallowly off-kilter electronic ambiance is little more than wheezy samples and pecked notes.
4,Not bad at all,"Well 1st of all I want to agree with Lorne about that the song ""adriana"" is not the best one at all. Presonally I like ""get in"" ""all of the above"" and ""inside joke"".anyhow the cd is very nice and if you like rage against the machine you'll probabaly like that one either.3.5/5"
3,"Good, but far from something special",This is a CD that probably only nu-metal/alternative fans would like. The singer's voice does get a bit annoying. They could have picked a better single than 'Adriana' but it's cool. Best songs on this album are 'Inside Joke' and 'Open Season'.
2,HAVEN'T USED THIS BOOK YET,SCHOOLS HAVE YOU PURCHASE BOOKS FOR THEIR OWN CAPATALISTIC GAINS. My advice is to try to get by without it!!!! I have yet to even use my books for this semester. At wich would have cost me $600. bought new. Although this website saved me aprox. $400. I would have prefered not to purchase them at all and used the 200. on car insurance or maintainance.
4,"Easy to Install, Easy to Use","Could not have been easier to install - literally just put the included CD in the drive, and plug the device into your USB 2.0 port. Installed and self-configured in minutes. Very small, light, no additional power cords to worry about, no additional software (beyond the automatically installed drivers) to install - quick and easy. Only issue I found is that the antenna is permanent, so you could never swap for replacement/better antenna like you can on some other wireless NICs."
4,Wireless USB Network Adapter,"I have had great success with this adapter. It was very easy to install and use. While the antenna cannot be upgraded, the unit has very good range."
3,Not so easy to install,I haven't been able to make it work with the SURFboard Wireless Cable modem Gateway SBG900; the user's manual hasn't been of any use to me. This network adapter connects to the SBG900 but cannot find the Internet. Any ideas?
4,Excellent wireless adapter for the price.,"Excellent wireless adapter for the price. Set up was pretty easy and the connection speed is good. I use this for my kids computer on our AT&T; network with the 2Wire Wireless Router that AT&T; provides.This also is good for maintaining control of the internet for your kids. I can just unplug the USB cable, and remove the internet from my sons computer (like when it gets in the way of homework)."
4,Incomplete- can't review,"I didn't pay close enough attention to the product description before ordering...I needed it for my Mac OSX. As soon as I saw the Windows logo on box I went ""oops."" Gave it to my Son-in-law, I'll let him dub the old home movies to DVD instead!"
1,Disappointing Product,"This Pinnacle product is not worth your time. First computer I installed the software on would lock up the computer,requiring a reboot. I never did get it to operate on that computer. Tried to install the software on another computer and got it to work. I tried to copy some video with it but the picture was choppy. Also the longer the recording went,the sound started to run behind the picture. I sent this item back to Amazon. I did try Pinnacle support and they were very tough to get in touch with and not much help. Both installations were on computers running XP Pro. This product is a great idea too bad it does not work properly."
1,Anything but quick,"I don't have anything to compare this too, but I'm into hour 4 and still not one video has been transferred. Extremely disappointed. I've had to download mutliple patches, and I think that the equipment may be defective. I've spent hours pooring over the ""support"" web page. I'm hesitant to use up my ONE free support phone call. I will be charged for any subsequent calls."
4,Good but not the Best!!!,"Argerich and Maisky deliver a good performance,but not quite inspiring.The playing is virtuosic and heady but robs the work of its true majesty and grandeur.I recommend the inspired performance by the incomparable Pierre Fournier and Kempff as a top choice for these beautiful works.Fournier brings a broad lyrical flow and Kempff matches with a sensitive touch.It is like true noble friends sharing an intimate and inspired conversation.Truly a noble performance with a broad sweep and flowing lyricism at its best.i have not listened to Richter/Rostropovich but I do not have to.The Fournier/Kempff performance has a sense of completeness.I understand why Kempff is one of the very best ever when it comes to Beethoven's sonatas.Truly a great artist and fournier is in the same class.How sad that this album(deustche grammaophone)is not even listed in the Amazon catalogue!the sound quality is excellent for a 1965 recording!"
2,Better book exists elsewhere,"I agree with Peggy, this book doesn't have much meat even just for surveying the internet stocks landscape. ""100 Best Internet Stocks to Own"" by Greg Kyle does a much better job in this respect by providing more information on each company's background, major turn points of stock prices in their history, analysis of business challenges as well as opportunities. More informative and more insightful. Put these two books side by side, you'll notice the difference in no time."
1,This Book has nothing to do with Gene Wilder the Actor!,"It struck me as odd why Gene Wilder would be interested in Internet Stock - maybe it was his hobby, or perhaps in the passing years he had found himself a whole new career via his computer. But no.Amazon have credited Mr Wilder incorrectly as being the co-author of this work; they even have it linked to his DVD's and his (genuine) writing. You wouldn't know this unless you opt to go look at a huge scan of the book's cover where all will be revealed to you: the co-author is Gene WALDEN.Poor Mr. Walden, his one claim to fame snatched cruelly from his hands by a typographical error. Never mind. With any luck, Amazon will credit you playing Willy Wonka."
2,Fun and EXTREMELY SHORTLIVED,"Spiderman 3 was fun. The controls are by far the best for the wii yet. Activision managed to take full advantage of the possiblities of the wii remotes. However, the graphics are just okay, as well as the sound. Still, this doesn't stop you from enjoying this game. Like I said, the controls here get an 11/10! There is a major drawback here, though. I beat this game in under 7 HOURS, not including extras. This story mode is UNBELIEVABLY SHORT! Upon beating this game, rather than being happy I was dissapointed that it ended so fast. I would advise you to rent this game or buy it cheap, but do not spend your $50 on this incredibly short game. Fun but not worth the price."
3,"Fun in spots, falls short of expectations","pro:-Bruce Campbell...nuff said.-web swinging is fun and intuitive.-good selection of spidey villains.-being able to level up and choose new abilities.con:-the city is extremely bland. How are you supposed to scour for bonus items in a city that all looks vanilla?-short story line.-fighting system is extremely simplified and boring.Could have been much better, sad to say not as interesting or fun as Spidey 2 or Ultimate Spidey, two games this one obviously raided heavily for ideas and mission designs."
4,Best Spiderman 3 Experience out of any console!,"SM3 on the Wii has truly shown what the right minds with the right console can do. The game itself and the story may not have been all that great, but the web slinging with the Wii remotes was probably the most satisfying feeling I have had on the Wii. If you buy the 360,PS3 or PS2 versions you're going to get the same game, with almost nothing different. The Wii version offers you an amazing control scheme that can't be beat by any of the other consoles. If you really want to feel like spiderman swinging around the city, buy the Wii version!"
4,Not too shabby,"A decent game that so far has kept my interest . Controls get better with experience, web slinging alot of fun and the black suit feature is cool. Hopefully this is just a stepping stone for developers for Wii games! I will take fun controls over graphics any day"
2,TRY AGIN! SPIDER MAN!,"THIS GAME WAS NOT ENTERTAINING AT ALL,THIS FALL'S IN THE HATE IT SECTION/WASTE OF MONEY THAT'S IT PLEASE BUY ANOTHER TITLE I USED IT ON THE Wii, KID'S DIDN'T LIKE IT."
4,Spidey Rocks,"This game is fun, addictive, but short. If you play it straight (morning to late night or even earlier) you will beat the game. However there are several difficulty levels and several character combinations which keep it interesting. Best part of the game (unlike the DS version) is that you can choose your sidekick and the story is much more developed."
3,Jodi's review what the heck!!,"Well, here we are you wii fans. I love spiderman but the creators of the game either were not putting their best effort into the game or they were drunk. I got the game at game stop as soon as I saw it I was jumping up and down like a little boy. When I got home I popped the disc in and started playing. It was really fun, I beat it. After you beat the game you can do whatever you want to do; but if you collect all 50 of these spider emblems you get a speical surprise, but their pretty much impossible to find. While playing the game, mom started reading reviews on amazon about the game and all the reviews she read were all complaints about the game but I ignored her and paid the consequence of wasting money, so now I always do my homework before I buy a game. DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!! spiderman web of shadows looks interesting."
5,Premonition,"I have an older copy of this book - with a not so ridiculous cover art. This book offers an extraordinary look upon Afghanistan with an abundance of premonition and history so relevant to the current conflicts there. It is much less about the missing American woman as it is about redemption, the contrast of rural Afghanistan, and the history of humanity itself. One of my very favorites."
5,Another Plum,Unlike many of his novels we started in this Century. The plight of the story was a young rich heiress that leaves her Philidelphia home to marry a Afghan man with Turban driving a red caddy. As most she comes to learn her lesson but in the meantime a very good story evolves giving fine insight to Afganistan. Michener would take three years a least for a novel. He would research by living where the story takes place. Then a year of writing with another year of rewriting. That must be the menu to getting it right. I have never read a bad one. I highly recommend this novel.
3,What happened to the plot?,"Caravans was a flowing, easy to read book combining romance, comedy, adventure, and mystery. Even if the US were not concentrating so intently on Afghanistan, I would have still enjoyed reading this book.I found the characters lifelike and the plot unique. However, it seemed the plot was not the main focus of the story. It was overshadowed by description of Afghanistan, which was interesting to read, but had the plot been stronger, I would have given the book a higher rating."
5,Enlightning,"I think every person should read Caravans -- It details the culture of the Afghanistan people back to the years AD -- With this understanding, one can see that we should not be in Afghanistan -- If we were not there killing people, they would be our friends --"
5,Insight from Gunther,"While this book is dated, Gunther always did his research. The story gives significant insight into the tribal and social makeup of Afghanistan. Another tool to help anyone who is interested in understanding the history of this troubled non-country. The task we have given our servicemen over their is daunting and probably impossible."
3,Not my favorite Michener,"I purchased this book as it was the only Michener kindle book available. I have read several of his and loved them. This was Ok, It read better once Ellen Jasper fully entered the story, but that was half way through. She was an intriguing character and would of liked to have had more of her story. I just could not get involved with the characters as I do in a typical Michener novel. I am hoping they put some more of his books on Kindle. Texas, Hawaii, Centennial, Alaska, I loved all of those and would enjoy reading them again."
4,Caravans,"I enjoyed this book, and I think that Michener did a great job educating the reader as he tells of Ellen and Miller's experiences. The storyline and the characters were both interesting. It was amazing to think that a girl would behave the way Ellen did. It kept me wondering what she would do or say next,especially at the end of the book. The plot held my interest, and I enjoyed learning about some of the customs and history of Afghanistan."
2,"I love Michener, but I though this book stunk","Mr Michener has written some of my favorite books of all time, such as Centennial, Texas and Chesapeake, but I found this book simply rambling, boring, without Michener's usual interesting and intelligent plot line. The book, set in Afghanastan, introduces one to some of the cultural and environmental aspects of that land, which were interesting, but I never truly seemed to care much about the fictional characters. Call me spoiled by JAM's later blockbuster bestsellers, but I barely finished this one"
5,Riveting and Educational,"If 9/11 had never happened, perhaps I wouldn't have been hooked from the first page through the last. It made me curious about this seemingly insignificant country. Caravans wound up being one of those rare books, I didn't want to end.I can't get over the fact that it was written in 1963, so the novel isn't tainted by recent events. It astounds me how many of Michener's predictions for Afghanistan came true. Add to this memorable characters and a well-developed story that both entertains and teaches, this novel is a winner.After reading it and others about Afghanistan I am truly convinced that we Americans have no business interfering in a 3000 year old culture. If the Afghans want change, it must come from them. Revolution must come from the inside, not forced upon people from the outside."
4,Big thumbs up,"The biggest negative about James A. Michener's Caravans is that it's too short. I could have read on about 1946 Afghanistan, about the fascinating nomads who traveled the upland plateaus of Asia, along the three thousand year old caravan routes that took them from Jelhum in the winter to the mysterious Hindu Kush mountains in the summer. I have not read other Michener novels, yet, hoping by the way that more of them reach the kindle. The story itself is ok, but it's the underlying sociological and historical setting that makes it so compelling.Michener traveled to Afghanistan in the 50's and, refering to a trip that took him from Qala Bist to Rudbar he writes : This took us across the Registan desert in a caravan that camped at night in sand dunes with little water and less food. It was from the experiences of this trip that i developped my love of desert life."
5,Fantastic read,"What an easy way to learn the history, geography and customs of Afghanistan with a good mystery and a good love story added to the enjoyment."
3,Interesting and timely.....again!,This book will help you understand what Afghanistan is all about even though it was written forty years ago. Simple plot and pretty basic but as usual Michener has done his research and is able to show you the inside of the country as it was when he wrote it and what it was like a thousand years before that and what it is probably like today.Interesting read in light of today's strife in that part of the world.
4,Afghanistan in the recent past,"Having a daughter in Afghanistan at present, I wanted to read as much about the culture as possible. James Michener always researches his books, so I read this after a recently written nonfiction book, ""The Punishment of Virtue"". ""Caravans"" was a bit of a light weight read after the more recent events book, but it did give a history and an interesting personal involvement of the characters of 50 years ago...which for Afghanistan is just yesterday. If nothing else is read about the country, then this would be an easy and accurate account of an evolving culture."
4,Wow,"What a great backgrounder for today's experiment in Afghanistan. Fascinating descriptions of culture, terrain and climate in this huge country"
4,Good read,"Helps you understand a little more about Afghanistan and the people, customs, etc. Worth the time and money. Interesting read."
2,Not his best,Not his best - a bit superficial. You really don't get much understanding of the Afghanistan culture. Perhaps because this book was written in the early 1950's before Islam rose to the level it is today. I didn't find anything compelling in the characters. A fairly quick read of a once first tier author.
4,Great Story,"Typical Michener, but not as long as some of his books. As usual, I learned so much about a land that does not seem to have changed in several thousand years."
5,Not his usual formula - this is much better,"I read this years ago and loved it then. Got it out and re-read it and still love it. It takes place in 1946 Afghanistan and really shows the problems that they had and still do have. His trailer paints a rather optimistic picture of a moderizing Afghanistan that unfortunately didn't pan out. As far as the novel goes, I always thought that this (or The Source) was his best. It doesn't follow his usual formula of going back to one era and telling a story and then moving to another era and telling a story until 1100 pages are done. It tells one exciting story of a young American, from the State Department, traveling with nomads for a few weeks in 1946 Afghanistan. Read it and you'll know more about the land and the people."
4,Love The Story but.... 4 stars for the story 1 star for the errors.,"I've read author James Michener since the 70's and love what I learn from him and can count on him for a good page turning book. With this edition I have now read ALL his books, but this is my first kindle experience. While I am not an expert and my spelling and punctuation could use a lot of improvement I was, however, appalled by the number of errors I found. I paid 7.99 for this book in digital format which considering the aforementioned was overpriced."
5,Good Things Do Come in Small Packages,"As an expert collector of rare and good books on the occult magic, I have come across and studied many books on Black Magic, Voodoo and Psychic magic. This book is very good and well written from a real honest practicing Voodoo Worker. Not an armchair dreamiest. Don't let the size of this book fool you. This little book contains some of the best kept old school Occult secrets that are still hidden today and that still work. DePrince has collected many of these prized secrets that are presented in this little book which are very powerful and has been the source and expanded on by many so called modern magic books which are only rehashed from other writers who are less informed. If you want the real key to the occult powers and learn how the real old timers did real occult magic then get this book."
5,Works Exactly as Advertised,"I have installed the first 200 sq. ft. of an 800 sq. ft. home remodeling job. The stapler has been easy to learn to use, working flawlessly, and requires less effort than I thought it would."
3,This is a stapler! Not a nail gun.,"The section titled Frequently Purchased Together includes FLN-200 Nails. Most Pneumatic fasteners I've use can use either nails or staples. This one ONLY uses staples, so don't get the nails.I did a great deal of prep work, gathered tools, got everything ready, only to find that I bought the wrong fasteners. Several people have obviously made this mistake, causing Amazon's computers to attach them on this page. Frustrating and I don't see a way to let Amazon know so they can fix the issue."
3,Beware of the FLN-200 Nails,"I haven't used the stapler yet so I am giving it three stars and here's why. On the stapler page, there is a section entitled ""Frequently bought together"" and it lists the FLN-200 nails. Note: THESE ARE NOT THE RIGHT FASTENERS FOR THIS TOOL!!! The correct fastener is the BCS-1500 staple. Amazon is not actually saying that the FLN-200 is the correct fastener, but it is quite misleading that they show it as a ""frequently bought together"" item. Don't make the same mistake I did and buy the wrong nails."
5,Factory Reconditioned Bostitch Floor Stapler,"After looking at local hardware stores for a new hardwood floor stapler, we found this one on Amazon for hundreds of dollars less than the new ones; even cheaper quality new ones were way more expensive than this reconditioned Bostitch was. We received the stapler within 2 days of ordering and have used it to install the hardwood floors in our home. The stapler looked like brand new when we received it. We have installed 1,000' of maple flooring thus far, and the stapler performed perfectly. It never jammed, it never misfired. It was a great tool and made installing the floors a breeze. It's still a lot of work, as you have to pound the stapler with the hammer each time to fire it, but it's much easier than doing it manually. The floors look beautiful. We still have another 1,000' of floor to install on the second floor, but we're confident the stapler will continue to perform as it did for the first part."
5,Bostich Floor Stapler,I bought this tool for doing our home lower level. (800 sq. ft.) It was a big project and I knew I would be better off buying ratherthen renting one. I looked at several and decided on this one. I had never used one before and it totally exceeded my expectations.It never jammed or misfired. I would highly recommend this product if you are thinking about installing hardwood floors.
5,Reconditioned Bostitch Pneumatic Flooring Stapler,I bought this reconditioned flooring stapler to do our upstairs wood floors. The stapler looked brand new and works excellent. We have had no problems and the flooring stapler works great. Why pay for a new one when you can buy a reconditioned one at a lower price. Michelle
4,Reality Bites,"I read this work a year or so ago, and have never forgotten about it. I am searching for copies for every mother I know, it was that good. It made me laugh, cry, and feel not so alone in resenting my children at times. It is the most realistic portrayal of MY motherhood experiences I have ever read. If, at times you feel guilty and not up to the demands of motherhood, this book is for you."
4,MOTHERHOOD DEMYTHOLOGIZED,"Shirley L. RadlMother's Day is Over(New York: Charterhouse, 1973) 234 pagesMotherhood demythologized by a mother of two.Based on interviews with about 200 mothers.This book should be read by all womenwho are romantic about motherhood--to see what it is really like--and by all mothers who feel guiltyabout being terrible mothers.If you want to read similar books,search the Internet for:""Books Exploring the Decision to Have Children""."
3,"Looks fun, but not","This game looks fun but really does not follow the movie and each game is like a mini game. But if you want a game with not alot of movement with the wii then this is a good game. If you want a lot of movement don't get this, get Zelda the twilight princess! Graphics arn't that good for Shrek."
2,Granted that I haven't seen Shrek the Third,"I'n not sure if this game follows the plot of the 3rd installment of Shrek, but wow is it violent! It starts off with Shrek and the cat (Puss in Boots?) beating up various baddies and collecting beer steins/coins. I'm not real sure where it goes after that because my 8 year old niece lost interest due to difficulties opening a drawbridge style door. Obviously she is not a video-gamer! So I took the helm for about ten minutes to see if I could open the elusive gate. I had no luck opening it and we returned (banished) the game to the video store from wince it came! If you are looking for a game that will appease the youngster in your house I would go with Super Mario Galaxy, which is a much more ""kid friendly"" game. Mario is much easier to control and the violence is more ""cartoony"". Also the vibrant colors and cute characters in Super Mario Galaxy will make you and your children giddy!"
3,Review of Shrek the Third,This was a Christmas gift for my Grandson. It was shipped very quickly to his address.
4,Fun Game,"This is a pretty fun game, however, I wouldn't want my kids playing it. Just like the movie, there is some adult humor. My kids are too young to understand it yet but I do not want them running around saying it."
2,One player at a time?,I bought this game for my boys because they loved playing Shrek 2 for Gamecube and still play it on the Wii. As I'm writing this review my older son is playing while my younger son is watching which is just stupid. What type of video game for children only allows one player to play at a time? Good thing I bought it used with a return policy because this is definitely being returned for something that they can play together.
2,Typical Animated Movie-Based Video Game,"This is a typical animated movie-based video game.It has Shrek, Fiona, Donkey, and the rest of the Shrek gang.Fun for a little while, but not enough to keep playing."
1,For kindy folk or early primary...a little hardgoing beyond that.,"A lot of graphics going on for a lot of ""nothing much"" going on. =( Not a lot of fun and a bit of a waste of time.Definitely for young kids."
2,Disappointed for Shrek 2 Xbox player,"Our family really enjoyed the original Xbox version of Shrek 2. It had an appropriate amount of puzzles and actions, its multi-player functionality, and graphics was rather rich (stages, items, interactivity, etc). So naturally we thought Shrek 3 would have been an upgrade. However, Shreak 3 for Wii was really a disappointment.First, the multi-player function is gone. When you're playing through the storyline, you can only be 1 person. Collaborate playing in Shrek 2 is gone except for maybe in minigames, and we loved that! Also, there is entirly too much fighting and *very* little puzzles. From level to level, scene to scent, we find ourselfs fighting endless people by eldlessly shaking the controller. The background and scenes are far less interesting than 2. Overall, it was a step back from 2. Good thing we only paid $12 including shipping from an Amazon supplier for the game."
1,DON'T GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!,"This game is way too easy. I beat it in about 2 hours. The graphics stink, and the plot line isn't that well done. Don't waste your time and your money."
2,colors are wrong,The hat is exactly what I wanted...almost. The flag that is embroidered on the back is messed up. It has gray where there should be white and the blue is not where it should be either. Most people won't notice. That's why it's so cheap though.
3,Fun...Sorta of...If you have time.,"Full disclosure, this is my first DVD game - probably my last as well. My son loves dinosaurs and is a big fan of all the Jurassic Park movies so I had high hopes for this product.The game is structured efficiently for 4 players and the instructions on the DVD make sense. The game also includes a playing board, die and moving pieces. It was not immediately obvious (and still isn't) how these fit into the game. Oh well.The game itself is filled with cut-scenes and detail about dinosaurs. These are integrated in a way that largely kills the momentum of the game. Some of the ""tasks"" are fun, some are not. I think if you like the pacing of professional baseball you will like this game :)"
4,"THIS MAN IS RAW!!!!!!!.........TO ME THA MOST FEARED MC,ON THA WEST!!!!",MC EIGHT HAD A GOOD RUN....BACK IN THA DAYZ....I'LL NEVER FORGET HIS HARDCORE CLASSICS.MUST TRY MUST BUY.
4,"A SOLID FOLLOW-UP TO ""ITS A COMPTON THANG""","i bought this cd early 1991, and it still bumps. it came out when Westcoast Gangsta Rapp was on the rise across the hip-hop world. although THE CHILL seems to disappear on this cut, MC EHIT held it down like a tru G, and went solo threw the entire cd. EHIT's lyrical flow tightens up tremendously, compared to his debut release, and he tends to rapp with alot more emotion than before. notables on this cd is: track #'s 1-7 and 9-12. in other words, the whole album is tight. especially, CAN I KILL IT?. from the amount of review's on this page i guess many people didn't buy this cd. what a pity. and if you on this page then you know what i'm saying, submit that review because this album was tight ya know. and if you dont know then buy it.""Q"""
2,lovesongs in German are lovesongs anyway,"Stefan Waggershausen is German poprock singer. and this is his best song compilation. i found that the best songs are: Bäng Bäng (it means - Bang Bang, i suppose), Kapitän (Captain), Bitte,Herr Doktor (Please, doctor), Der Clown ist tot (The Clown is dead). everyone can found here some good lovesongs, especially if someone likes some German poprock."
4,Great fun!,"I really liked this book. I am not a big mystery""who done it"" fan, but this was one great book! It is slow at first but by the end, you won't be able to put it down. It is beautifully written and lots of details and suprising turns. If you like mystery or just want a good,easy read,this is the book for You!"
5,"Mo from Cairo, Egypt","I am in the process of studying one of the pieces from this cd (Kabalevsky), and out of all of the recordings of the kabaevsky that I have heard, this is the one that has been the most helpful to me! Gil Shaham knows how to show how it is REALLY played! The Glazanouve and the Tchaikowsky are also really beautifully played. If you like a fine balance of Russian music, BUY THIS CD!!!!"
5,"Negima! 6, a must have for fans","Fantastic! Ken Akamatsu doesn't disappoint with another great book in the series. I felt he wrapped up the ""field trip"" story line very well, and I'm anxious to see the next book. (some sexual themes, not recommended for under 13)"
5,Good conclusion to the Kyoto Arc,"An Awesome Read. Negmia fans will like it. Great actions, suspense, and comedy all in the right places.Need I say more?"
5,Both are back and great,"For some time now PSB, and DOA have placed ""limited releases and mixes"" on pressing. I have had this single for quite some time as a promo remix (now released) from the ""Olde English"" Label, it is stunning, the lyrics by PSB, with vocals by Pete Burns, are a great combination, with a feel for all 3 arists past history in misic. PSB are well known for tag teaming with other artists, Liza, Dusty Springfield, Boy George to name a few. This is not a real ""dance"" track, yet a synth-electro vocal mix that infects you with Pete's vocals and a combo of DOA and PSB feeling. If you do get a copy of this cherish it! It comes simply in a double cardboard sleeve and very well worth the $ for TRUE fans of these amazing singers and songwritersJason prof DJ"
5,solid little intro,"This book is a short introduction to performing basic Muslim prayers, from physical movement aspects, to what is said during the prayers, as well as the times to say them. It also gives prayers and sacred sayings relevant to all sorts of other activities. I am sure there are more extensive and comprehensive books out there, but this is a great book for learning, or at least becoming familiar with, the essentials."
3,Prayer book,I thought it was a well written book but I am still left with other questions. I think this is a good guide for someone who has questions or wants to understand more about the muslim religion.
5,"Happy, carefree tunes surely to lift your mood...","I was listening to it all throughout a 9-hour flight --even left it on when I slept!I don't understand all of the lyrics to the songs, but the tunes are so catchy that I found myself humming along soon after. The in-flight magazine said that it's music for kids, but hey, for the kids-at-heart, too!"
4,Classical Turkish folk songs beautifully rendered,"If you are unable to find this title it has been re-released as ""Traditions of Turkey"" by Arc Music (EUCD 1776).Accompanied mainly by saz (long neck lute), the performances are beautiful and calming. Additional instruments that can be heard on some selections include the darbouka, def (single headed drums), and finger cymbols.The liner notes include the lyrics and translations for the seven songs of love and lament. The first and last selections are lively and the only likely dances. The rest of the performances are arabesque and improvisational. If you love traditional Turkish chamber music this is for you. Aside from this CD, music of this sort is most likely found on a Turkish import recording."
4,"there's only one dynamite track, but...","...DAMN it's a good one. The first selection, ""Hudayda"", if listened to at maximum volume, can make you literally want to ride around decapitating people. Whenever you're feeling bored or tired, just blast it over headphones, imagine yourself a nomad warrior or janissary, and feel your self-confidence explode through the top of your skull. I'm giving all 4 stars directly to that track, as all the others are rather uninteresting unless you have a special interest in the repertory."
5,nice surprise,This was a gift for a friend with a new dachshund puppy and the friend loved it. This book is out of print but the used copy was in good shape as stated and arrived before the time estimated and well packaged. Recommend the book and the shipper.
1,Not what I ordered,The item that I ordered was supposed to be the Director's Cut of this movie and it is not! I already own this version.
5,Who should watch this?,"My wife-to-be and I saw the film in the theater, in 1984. We found it a little strange (had trouble with the suspension of disbelief), BUT, loved it anyway...Rather than writing a detailed review, I would suggest that Baby Boomers make this a must see, while those born in the next two generations, with your growing dislike / anger toward anything enjoyed by the Boomers, skip it. That way you won't feel compelled to write all your negative reviews. In other words, get a life!"
5,Wonderful,"I love this movie. It is moving, and shot beautifully, and has subtlety. It wasn't a big hit, and some people I've recommended it to think it's slow. But I don't agree. A lot of it is understated (although, certainly not the ending!), and if you're used to over-the-top ARMAGEDDON type junk, then this might not be your cup of tea. But if you have a mind that can perceive subtleties in life, then you should love this. Incidentally, the original novel, THE NATURAL, was inspired by a real-life incident, where a baseball player was shot by a twisted fan."
4,If you thought Little Big League was longer,"If Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) only wanted wanted to play baseball, they why did it take him 16 years before he played in his rookie season with the New York Knights. At first he had a tryout with the Cubs but I guess seem to quit after he got shot. And then 16 long years later he found a team. The manger tells him that he should be thinking of retiring from baseball then starting playing baseball. This movie almost runs 2 and 20 minutes. But if you love baseball, I reccomend you to watch this movie. If you like this movie check out these titles.Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, Little Big League, The Rookie, Angles in the Outfield (1994), Rookie of the Year"
