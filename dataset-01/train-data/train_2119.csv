4,Quick Read good travel book.,"This book is a good, not a great read. However, the book is worth the price, for the sermon that much of the book is written around. The quote about ""this momentous day"" Will give you something to think about for a long, long time. As for the story... The characters are kind of ""cartoonish"" but you never have to wonder who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. All in all a fun afternoon's read."
5,From the Corner of his Eye,"I am a huge Dean Kootnz Fan and this was one of my very faviorite's. I love his style of having more than one main character and alternating chapters between each of them. The idea in this book about how everyone's life is linked to another's in some way brought the story together. It really makes you believe this is true and there is other worlds out there. I loved his simile of those other worlds being like ""swiss cheese"". That really helped me picture it in my mind. This book, in my opinion is right up there with Watchers and I don't know how anyone could give it a less than 5 star review. If I could I would give it 6 Stars!"
5,Barty Smarty,"This is my first Dean Koontz novel, I really enjoyed it. I understood everthing that went on in the story. It makes you think about the supernatural. This book has different characters, and it tells what happens as the years goes on. It is very interesting, I was never bored. I recommend this to people who likes the supernatural/suspense novels."
4,A surprise from Koontz,"From the corner of His Eye is very different from any other novel that I've read by Dean Koontz before.Usally his work is a fast thill ride, this is more of an epic tale. I have to say I really enjoyed it,however it was kinda long. I think he could have edited some of the chapters. Some of the events didn't really add anything to the story. I did liked the fact that this novel got me thinking about topics I haven't before. This would make a excellent book club book."
1,boring,"I am on page 240 in this book and I am bored with it. So far this book has no horror or even suspense to keep me reading. Maybe it will get better, but I have already given up. I am disappointed because I have read a few of his books before and found them interesting, but I don't recommend this one at all."
2,A good bad guy wasted.,"I don't want to reveal too much about the book, but a couple of points.Is it possible to create a good bad guy, but place him in the wrong story? I think that is what happened here. Cain Jr. is a very interesting antagonistic. But he seems rather out of place in a book filled with good guys(and gals)with superhuman powers.About halfway through the book I realised poor Cain didn't stand a chance. So there is really no suspense or excitement at the end of the story. Just Cain running around killing off secondary characters that are within his abilities to do away with. When he finally does run into young barty, it is like a moth flying into a electric bug zapper."
1,Koontz lost sight of the plot!,"I read a lot of books, all genres, & used to be a big Koontz fan (back in the Watchers & Strangers days) but this book was awful. The description on the back cover did not jive with the book at all. Whatever was the point in Bartholomew losing his sight? Too many details that had no bearing on the plot. I couldn't take one more verbose paragraph about Edom & Jacob and their penchant for disasters...enough already! It appeared as though Koontz changed his direction midstream. Very disappointing & I do NOT recommend this book."
3,Koontz is getting old and worried about his own afterlife?,"I love Koontz and have loved him since I was a teenager. But this was not one of his best. He gets better and better as a wordsmith but here he fails to adequately flesh out his characters or his themes. What were the ""ripples"" that formed Junior Cain? Are we responsible for the unforeseen consequences or even our well intentioned actions. This book was similar to Sole Survivor in theme and tone, but neither book offered any new or fresh insights, just a new-age feel good philosophy."
3,Maybe the ending is better somewhere else.,"My first Koontz book, and very impressed with his talent and the first half. The very noticable drop in quality of the writing in the last half reminded me of my essays in the ""blue books"" in college when I got off to a great start and about midway through realized I had nothing more to say but kept writing anyway to fill up the book. It did make me eager to try another Koontz, any suggestions?"
3,"Deja Vu, The Whole Way Through","Well I must say that this book has an amazing beginning. The first chapters or so keep you completely enthralled and riveted. Charachters are very real and life like.Now here is where the book goes haywire..About half way through you begin to feel like you have to read TOO MUCH to get to the point of each event. Many times I found myself almost 'skimming' to get to there. I love Dean Koontz novels, but this one is a bit wordy..not only that, this is VERY similar to many other novels that he has written..the symbolism, super natural ""events"", the amazing child prodigy, someone out to kill him, etc. In other words, you kind of know what is going to happen at most turns because it's happened in a previous novel.Anyway, a great novel, sure to hit some top lists - BUT, certainly not one of his most original works."
1,Not this time,"As an avid Koontz reader that has spent days of enjoyment with his books I feel really bad about giving a bad review. I really wanted to like this one, but after one hundred pages waiting for something to happen, I put it down never to be picked up again.Something has happened since ""False memory"". On later years Koontz seems to be under contract to produce two books a year. Even though still good reads, this is not the Koontz I knew and that had me up all night. We can only hope he returns to form. In the meantime; you might want to revisit, or read for the first time great books like ""Watchers"", ""Whispers"" or the excellent ""Estrangers""."
2,A let down,"First time reading a book from this author...and I have to say...I will probably never read him again. The first 3/4 of the book was great. Very much a ""page turner"", but when it came to the ending it just kind of fizzled out. I was very disappointed on how neutral the ending was, there was no great climax. No sad ending. It just ended. I was sitting there thinking...that's it, that's all he could come up with. A total let down."
2,Stand in the Corner,I found this book to be very disappointing. The main antagonist was bizarre to say the least and his problems with every killing were comical and had no reason in the whole plot line. Then when the book is ended it's like he was tired of writing and decided ok i'm done. It's like a Stephen King ending a lot of pages with no great finish or any finish. I don't know what happened but this one sure missed it.
3,black-and-white but not too bad,"I read this book (my first Dean Koontz) a while ago and am now reviewing it. It's a decent book, although I found the plot kind of contrived, kind of too spiritual near the end, and the characters were too black-and-white. Frankly, I rather liked Junior as a villian, and his weird attacks of various problems after a killing were for me the most memorable parts of the book, that I still think about sometimes. It seemed like all the people on the side of good were just too perfect, Mary Sues. And I could tell Junior was meant to be unquestionably evil although I liked reading about him best. A little more grayscale would have been nice."
4,Not the best but....,"This is not his best work, but I must say that while the bulk of the book was mostly spent on character development, the characters are very compelling and interesting. I was a little disappointed that the final confrontation was so quick (I was getting suspicious when there weren't very many pages left!) and kind of anti-climatic, but it was a very good book and proves that Dean Koontz can really persuede you to care about the characters. They felt like my family at the end. Enjoy this one!"
3,From the corner of his eye,This is the first Koontz book I read. It was good and kept up my interest throughout. Very original story line and interesting characters. Overall it was worth reading but does require great imagination.
3,A murky tale tries to combine physics and pseudo faith,"Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Koontz. I put him on the same tier as King for entertaining reading. This novel, however, has characters that are soooo unreal. Most of the many, many strangely named characters are either saintly or gifted with the ability to put quantum physics to good use. I really couldnt tell what direction the story was going in...is it a moral tale of faith in God or are mankind's real saviors gonna be able to jump from one dimension to the next? The only person that seemed the least bit real was the evil antagonist, Junior Cain. I can imagine his type being in the world, unfortunately. I do give the book three stars for its thriller aspect, Koontz didn't let me down in that department. The ironic thing about this review is that to understand what I am saying, you have to read the book!"
1,NOT a welcome change!!,"Apparently Dean Koontz has fallen prey to the same malady that has afflicted James Patterson twice now, a need to prove that even though they have dark imaginations and are capable of thrilling suspense, they need you to know that they have a spiritual side, too. Koontz's self-indulgence is particularly heavy handed, with subtle-as-a-brick name choices for his characters, ie Seraphim, Celestina, Grace and Angel for one family of women, Cain as the bad guy and Paul Damascus as a man wandering in the wilderness after the death of his first wife. As a few of the other reviewers have pointed out, the book starts strong but quickly deteriorates. A writer of Koontz's talent can be pardoned a strike-out once in a while-let's just hope he's not going through a long drawn-out crisis of faith or whatever this represents!!"
4,"It's well-written, but I have a strange feeling....",".... that I am reading any one of the Reader's Digest condensed books. It contains many 13-cent words one would find in ""Towards More Picturesque Speech,"" and acts of kindness in a Reader's Digest monthly book feature, but that's not really a bad thing. The way it's written forces one to broaden his or her lexicon and look at things in new ways. I could use more kindness in my life, too. The plot moves along rather nicely. It's propelled by Cain's need to hunt down the Barty while's driven batty. I don't know if the philosopher Zedd is a stand-in for 60's selfishness icon Ayn Rand, but Koontz should check up on Robert James Bidinotto's ""Oasis"" essay for more information. The magician James Randi would also be fascinated by this book. It's Biblical in its characters' names; surely, if Cain killed his brother Abel as it says in the book of Genesis, would that have been the first instance of quantum realities gone awry?"
2,What Was Koontz Thinking,"From the Corner of His Eye is a little over six hundred pages long. The story itself can be told in two hundred pages. The drive in the story is that the main villian, Cain, is after the child Bartholomew, and the two only meet briefly near the end of the novel. The pace is slow, and the conflict is trivial. The emotional pull to hate the antagonist is not there. Actually, the voice of the narrative doesn't even come across as allowing the reader to feel anything for Cain. 'So, he is a killer with a crazy thought process' is what went through my mind when I read the novel. Overall, the book was a bad novel. The reason why the book gets two stars instead of one in my opinion is because of the emotional anguish that Bartholomew's mother had to face when she found out that her son would lose her sight. That portion of the narrative was beautiful. Koontz has written better, and I hope he will write better in the future."
5,Vintage Dean Koontz,The book has many themes overlapping. It was easy and quick to read. The characters were believable. It held my interest and was delightful the way the plot evolved.
2,Disappointing,"I found this to be much more tedious and sacharine than most Koontz stories. He took almost a third of the book just to set the stage before the plot really got moving. This was not nearly as clean and crisp as many of his books, and not nearly as gripping. I finished it, but would rate it as one of his most disappointing efforts."
2,Big Disappointment!,"This story started out very good and it got really exciting and then it was like the author went out to lunch and never came back. Total disappointment! The ending was so stupid, that when the tape was finished after all the hours of listening, I kept thinking somewhere I missed something. James Patterson could have and would have had a much better ending then this author."
1,Good Idea Horribly Executed,"This was my first, and probably last, Koontz novel. While the premise was interesting and the plot fairly well put together (enough so to merit the 1 star), the overblown, purple prose and inconceivable dialog only served to accentuate the improbability that characters such as those in this story could ever exist. Especially annoying was the use of unlikely names for so many of the major characters (Enoch, Seraphim, Celestina, Harrison, Bartholomew, Edam, Neddie and Googlie, to name a few). Although the book has adult themes and a few adult scenes, it seems to be written on about a sixth grade reading level, an odd combination. A few S.A.T. vocabulary words have been thrown in to try to raise the bar, but the effort falls short of making the work challenging. On the plus side, the story was compelling enough to keep me reading despite the many grating qualities of the writing."
2,Puhleeeeze!!!!,"I either really love or really hate Dean Koontz's books. This one falls into the latter category. It seemed as if the book could have been finished in about half as many pages as he wanted to drag these people all through. From the first, it oozed with a sentimental sugar coating from Agnes' pies, which by the way only served to make me very hungry while I read it. I thought it was a little far out that all these people came together to make this one person suffer. That the villian(I won't name him as it will give a way the best surprise in the book), would be so gullible as to believe the stuff he does makes him more than deserving of his just desserts in the end and I don't mean Agnes' pie either. From the Corner of His Eye reads like a Hallmark Christmas movie of the week. I did not expect something so cutsie from one of the kings of Horror!!"
2,"Wait for the paperback, if then","I usually enjoy Koontz, but this time he blew it. The novel moves much too slowly and with one excepton, his characters are one dimentional, either all bad (irritating is a better word) or all good (and irritating). It's a bad thing when one doesn't care who comes out the winner, but with this book, just let it end, please."
4,Classic Koontz,"Koontz does a great job of telling a story but doesn't he always. If you like his work then I think you will like this one as well. There are a few problems though. The ending was a little light. I was hoping for more and he just didn't deliver like normal. With that said, the characters are classic Koontz and very likeable. The story keeps you interested and has plenty of twist and turns to keep you guessing. Over all it was a good book."
3,Eh,"I am a big fan of Mr. Kootz. This book was quite interesting and I was curious and anxious the whole way through. It is an odd read for what happens in it. To be honest, I am not a big fan of sci-fi and this was a little on the sci-fi side. No matter, Dean is still a great writer."
2,Imposter?,"FTCOHE is so far removed from his usual excellence that I'm not entirely convinced Koontz wrote it.After *classics* like lightning, dragon tears, strangers...something sure smells fishy. We can only hope dean recovers from this bad patch quickly.Too long, too boring. Missing too many Koontz trademarks (ie: witty character dialogue). Cain is an interesting character, but at 600 + pages even he becomes stagnant. Pass."
3,Just not one of his best,"Koontz has written many great books, but From the Corner of His Eyes is certainly not one of his best. If you are used to reading Intensity, Watchers and the like, you probably won't have the urge to finish this book in one night. I was quite captivated by the first half of the book, but as the story progresses it gets, well, a little too ""quantum mechanical"" for me. And the demise of the villain - simply disappointing. In fact, if you skipped you last 7 or 8 pages of the book you wouldn't have missed a thing. We have seen better Koontz books."
4,From The Corner Of His Eye,"Forget the night light, pulling the blankets over your head, and foregoing sleep; Koontz has surpassed all of those tired old cliches with his adroit ability to lure the reader in and genuinely disturb them. And his latest thriller - FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE - is no exception. Anytime, anywhere, 24-7, Koontz is gonna getcha, and he's gonna scare the hell right out of you...Gary S.Potter Author/Poet"
2,Ridiculous Ending,The book keeps you going and then in the last few pages he drops the ball and ends the book. Almost like he hit a deadline to publish and finish and just tied it up ridiculous. Very disappointing.
3,Scary and keeps you on the edge of your Seat,"To be honest I haven't finished the book yet, but from what I've read so far I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in thrillers. The book is a thick novel, but the chapters are two or three pages long, so you move through it quickly. Koontz, takes you on a journey when he brings you into the villian - Junior Cain's state of mind - this guy can rationalize his way through anything and his dependence on self-help books is creepy. An excellent read that will give you goosebumps!"
3,an ok read but not enough answers,"It was an enjoyable read - I haven't read many koontz books - so not an expert on his style. I do agree that some of the main characters were just too ""sweet"" for me and not enough answers at the end about what was going on with those kids."
4,Kudos Koontz!,"What a great book! This was my first book by Koontz and after reading this I must read more. I couldn't put it down. I just wish that something different happened to the ""bad guy"". That's the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars."
3,Pie Lady Redux!,"typical Koontz... mayhem by page 2... he's now into 'Quantum Physics' as an excuse for his supernaturalnalia, AND he borrows a queer family who were sidelines in a previous novel and centralizes them here 'The Pie Lady' and her two weird bros..but that fits the very syrupy nature of all of the players except the absolutely overcooked antagonist6/10 (he's still fun to read)"
4,The pages kept turning,"Well, I enjoyed reading this book, the pages flew by! I enjoyed the characters, the writing, the humor, suspense, i enjoyed hating the ""bad guy""...but I do have to agree with the previous reviewer in saying that plot was glossed over a little bit.I mean, at the end, it's sort of a tidy-up ending, and you are left feeling like maybe a bigger explanation is due. But I think you can see what Koontz was using for the premise of this novel.I think what it needed was a longer conclusion when it came to dealing with the ""bad guy"". I still really liked the book though and I can say that the 730 pages went fast."
5,What a great book,A must read. The twist and the turns keep you going through this strange and dark but fascinating book.
2,Tedious,"Another disappointment! I'm a huge Koontz fan but this book is making me believe he really is off his game. Not as bad as his ""Odd"" comic books mind you. Big build up and everyone peters out. He makes this undeniable case the bad guy is not evil but truly insane before the good guys torture him. So much potential to build around the kids and their gifts but we spend two thirds of the book in the mind of a madman. This book didn't need to be 730 pages long."
4,Different from his usual but WONDERFUL,"This book is very different from the typical Dean Koontz books, but I loved it. I loved the characters that Mr. Koontz chose and look forward to another book of this type."
5,Koontz back in top form!,"I don't read all of Koontz's novels having found some books predictable. When I read this book's synopsis it intrigued me and I decided to try it. Boy, am I glad I did! I had to tell myself several times to slow down and read every page. The basis of Koontz's novel is that every life is intertwined and works together just like the strings of a violin. If one of the strings breaks then the violin loses an integral part. The book also touches on some quantum physics (reality as we think we know it and do different dimensions exist), but don't let that scare you. All themes are presented in an exciting, terrifying, can't flip the page fast enough, easy to read way and each character (even the protagonist) is presented in a sympathetic, enriching light. I believe that this is one of his best books and it really left me feeling great and hopeful about life."
4,Buy this book PLEASE!,"I am so thrilled with this book, I think I will even read it again very soon. I love the way all the lives of these exceptional people intertwine to form such a captivating story. The only setback to this story is that the ending is kind of rushed. All the characters are extraordinary. Koontz skips so many years at the end, I was left wondering what interesting incidents happened during these years. This is a real page turner."
2,HOW TO RUIN A GOOD BOOK,"This book held my interest until the last hundred pages. I did suspect it was getting a little wacko when the kid walked in the rain and didn't get wet. Well, it got worse. This was the first book I read by Koontz and won't go for another. Is there an error on page 603? Thought it should say ""vow of poverty"" not ""vow of property."""
2,Not up to Dean Koontz's Standard,"I give Dean Koontz credit for taking on new ground in this book about quantum mechanics theory, but the story doesn't really work overall. Some of my ojections are the extended time frame and number of characters, all of which are either too evil or good to seem real, and tragedies that seem contrived only to maximize emotion."
2,well...,"At first, this book seemed great! A little boy-genius who has amazing abilities, and a foe he'd never heard of, and a little girl with artistic talents.Unfortunately, Koontz did a Terrible job in creating this children in a way that would make them believable. Also, the good guys were FAR too good, and seemed faultess, while the bad guy was, well, bad and stupid. He was, however, almost three dimensional, which a lot of authors have difficulty doing(creating ""bad guys"" who aren't completely flat).The end of the ""bad guy"" was sad, a few hundred pages spent building this character until he seemed practically undefeatable, and one sentence killing him."
1,Frustrating and torturous,I had a very difficult time keeping myself from throwing this book out. Even with only 30 pages to go I am struggling with finishing it because it is SO AWFUL! The summary on the back of the book is meaningless and it is clear that Mr. Koontz wrote this book with an eventual screenplay in mind... There is so much nonsensical space filler in this book that I have now decided to skip over because I'm tired of reading it. It was really exciting in the middle for about 100 pages... but I'll never ever ever recommend it or read another koontz book again.
3,Not his best work,This is certainly not his best work to date. It took a while for me to get into the book. About half way through is when it all comes together. Typical Koontz introducing the characters and it is all needed background but just long winded. The middle to the end of the book is when I couldn't put it down. Wonderful ending and the last half of the book was the best part of this book. I enjoyed it once I got to the middle when the characters started to come together.
2,what climax?,"Very strange book indeed. One of my favorite Koontz books was 'Ghost's' and I've been reading him over the years for light hearted topical suspense.This is what happened to me w/ this book... I got to the *cherished* climactic end -- and had little idea I was there! Reason? Uneven pacing, benign characters, and a goody-two shoes plot line that finally numbed me. I actually got to the end, saw 'author's note' and realized I had just cruised thru the last chapter. But truly, the last chapter, last paragraph could have been re-written half way through the darn book with out to much effort. Generic, oft-repeated lines of thought, and a lack of a closure or final ""Oh -yeah.. ah-hah!"" that we usually get.I like you Dean, but let's get back to basics!"
2,If you're bored...,"This book was good, but nowhere near his best. The main ""bad guy"" of the book is linked psychologically to the main ""good guy"" somehow. Bartholomew, the ""good guy"", and his girl friend Angel, another ""good guy"", have strange abilities. Basically, it's good vs. evil on a strange scale, but predictable. When you discover their abilities, you can predict the outcome. I finished the book because I was bored, not because I wanted to read it. I had no other book to read."
1,Ho-hum: Koontz makes haste slowly.,"Koontz takes well over one-fourth of the book's 600 plus pages just to set the opening scene (dozens of pages alone for the car crash, Barty's birth and hospital stay) which led me to wonder how he was ever going to get to the end of the week, let alone Barty's thirteenth birthday. Despite being a long-time Koontz reader, I felt a lot of the suspense and disbelief I experienced was more about Koontz's glacial pacing than about the story. Koontz seemed to realize how long the project was getting and sped things up about 300 pages into the book but not for the better since the climactic encounter with the villain and our saintly heroes occurs 600 pages in and lasts for only a couple of paragraphs. That's it! The whole point of the book - the encounter between good and evil - and its over in a blink and a push! I feel Koontz just started typing without a real goal in mind until he neared his 600 page contract requirement and decided to wrap things up."
2,Koontz can do better,"I love Koontz's books but this one was a disappointment. The plot is clunky and the climax falls flat. Koontz strangles the suspense with badly executed plot devices and multiple undeveloped characters. He also creates a villian that is both violent and boring (how this is possible I am still trying to figure out). The book is only saved by the occasional beautiful imagery and one and only one unsuspected plot twist. If you have to read this book, buy in paperback."
5,Absolutely Wonderful Dean Koontz,"Beautiful, redemptive, classic Koontz. Starts off slow then takes off flying and pulls you into the center of a loving network of family and friends."
2,Having trouble finishing,"I love Dean Koontz novels, but I am having a problem with this one.I don't know if I will finish. I stop and read something else and then will go backto it. But this guy junior is so evil, and everyone else seems a littlebackwards."
3,"Anticlimatic conclusion, but not a complete waste of time...","I've read about 15 of Mr. koontz's books, and unlike most of his other works, I have a pretty low opinion of this one. While the characters are intriguing, and the story line suspenseful, my enjoyment of the book was diminshed by the way Koontz barely explained the theory of quantum physics that was supposed to be a main theme in the book. There are also dead ends( things that occur throughout the story that are never fully explained), and the end is very anticlimatic and quite dissaponting. FOr those who have never read Koontz I suggest they start with another book such as Itensity, Sole Survivor, or the Christopher Snow novels. However, this novel was entertaining and had a good message. The writing was very elegant, and some moments very poignant, and i have to admit that i shed more than a few tears."
4,From the Corner of his eye,I just finished reading this book and I find it to be a wonderful book. I have read a few other books of koontz and I think this is a great book. It just keeps you going because you never know what is going to happen next. You have to keep reading because you need to know how all these characters are going to end up being tied together. It is amazing how they all come together in the end. I would recommend this book to anyone.
5,I loved it!,"I'm a big Koontz fan, and this book is definitely right up there in my top 5 Koontz books. I enjoyed the characters who I felt were well written, deep people. The book reminded me greatly of the two Chris Snow books and maybe that's why I liked it so much. If you like Koontz, especially the Snow books, I say buy this one. You won't go wrong."
4,Couldn't put it down,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, although it did get a teeny bit slow in some areas. The way all of the lives of the people intertwined seamlessly really captured me and the secrets that lie in ""other worlds"" made me think and view the world around me in a different way.Was disappointed that Junior Cain was dealt with to what seemed to me as ""easily"" ........ Didn't feel the characters were too good or insipid.Way different to most other Koontz I've read but extremely enjoyable. Would be interesting to see the life and discoveries of young Mary Lampion in a sequel book."
3,Koontz cooks up a little stew.,"This is a good Koontz novel, but not a great Koontz novel. Like a Chinese meal you enjoy it, but it leaves you hungry. Koontz throws in a little quantum physics to spice up what is otherwise a pretty well written, but somewhat bland murder story. He takes a dash of psycho killer. Adds a pinch of mystic cop. Stirs in two babies, one vanila one chocolate, a lady who bakes pies, a black artist (not a black arts artist which would have been interesting) with various and sundry minor characters in walk on parts. He serves you a fine appetizer, but not much of a meal. I enjoyed the novel. I'll read more Koontz even though the ending left me feeling hungry for a Stephen King main course."
3,"Koontz ""almost"" back to his great writing","I was so excited when I read the first couple of chapters. This book starts exactly like you would expect a great Koontz book to start, I bow to his descriptive accident scenes. But slowly and painfully fragmented at the end. I never felt scared like in Koontz old books. Way too many characters to squeeze in, should have left some of them out for another book. What I really missed was the way Koontz normally gets us to know the good guy in a book well. In this book I knew the villian better then the good guys, so well that I started feeling sorry for him. The happy ending was just way to long I always like your books because of them but in this one it got carried away. You are almost back Koontz please do try to write one of your great books again! I am still trying to figure out what books these other people who reviewed your book are talking about."
5,the best,this is a brand new book . it's exactly perfect as if never even been opened. I am very pleased with my purchase at such an incredible price. also I got it very fast. thanks
3,Rivals Anne Rice on being overly descriptive,"I did enjoy the audio version... all 22 hours of it. I think I would have been less forgiving of the copious amount of needless dialogue and descriptions if I'd been reading the print version. Good listening while working on a big quilt though. The first part was very good, but as the story went on and more characters were introduced, it was like a growing ball of string and it started to unwind in a few places--dead ends that never tied into the main story. I was disappointed in the ending--esp. how the villain was disposed of so easily. I would have liked to savor his demise a little longer. My favorite characters are the children--Barty and Angel. Loved Miss Velveeta Cheese. This is the 3rd Koontz I have read in the past month, so I think I'll give him a long break. I prefer more action-driven suspense over the stalking and deranged imagination of characters like serial killer Enoch Cain."
5,LOVED IT!,Incredible! I have a new favorite ... this book has it all. Suspense mostly ... hard to put down! Great read.
5,nancy's review on the koontz book from the corner of his eye,"I thought that this was a pretty intresting book. The things that had happen you probably wouldn't of guessed would of happened. Like in the beginning of the book when junior killed his wife Naomi, no one ever exspected that. Then how Junior became this really awful person, we found out that he had a lot of bad passed and also a bad future. Vanadium was a good character to be used in this book, because you didn't know what he was going to do or when he was going to apear. Angel and Barty ended up being Junior's evil enemys because they sent him into a different world. Over all I thought this book was really good, and I would enjoy reading more of his books."
5,A Wonderful Read!,"I love a good scary horror novel as much as anyone, and this isn't it. There is something very different about this book. Yes it isn't a horror novel, but a story of hope. I didn't quite know what to expect with this book, and was a third of the way through it before it started to fall into place for me. I couldn't leave it alone, I had to know how these wonderful people (and one very bad one) finished up. I wasn't disappointed.This is a fun book to read on a chilly evening in front of a roaring fire. It will warm you from the inside and it scares you, and leaves you with a spark of mystery."
4,"Enjoyable story, bad ending","I have read several Dean Koontz books and have always liked them. Therefore, when a friend lent me this audiobook, I was anticipating a good story, although I was somewhat unnerved by the length of the book. The plot was absorbing and the descriptive words Koontz used were great. I was eagerly anticipating the revenge of detective Tom Vinadium (sp?) and the demise of Junior Cane, and could not have been more disappointed in the way Koontz resolved this. After it happened, I thought, that's IT? After the length of the book and the detail Koontz goes into throughout the book, I thought the resolution would be extremely satisfying. I was completely let down. I would have liked to see/hear Junior's reaction, but there was nothing. I felt like I had wasted all that time listening to the book for nothing."
3,"decent, worth a look","I love a good Koontz book and while this one was good, it was not his best. Most fans of Koontz will like it and I imagine a lot of readers new to Koontz will find a new author to look for when visiting their favorite book store but ultimately this book falls short for what Koontz can deliver. I will not argue with a creative story but at times I felt the characters were throw backs to those in his past books. Cain was an interesting character but I feel like all his female characters are the same mold. I like the mold(strong, smart, resourceful, etc.)but at times it feels like their names could be interchanged and you wouldn't even notice. Other than that, I felt the story was a good one and Koontz's writing is wonderful as always. Some authors dazzle witth their use of language and Koontz is one of them. If you are new to his writing I suggest Fear Nothing first. It is hands down one of his best and will make you a fan for life."
2,Koontz can do much better.,"I have always been a Dean Koontz fan. However, I was truly disappointed with this book. Maybe it's because I had really high expectations, nevertheless, the book was disappointing. First of all, it took me two weeks to finish the book (I normally read a novel of this size within two days).There were times when I felt the book was rambling on. In addition, there were too many pages that said a whole lot of nothing! Sorry Koontz, I am still a fan of yours, but this time you missed your mark."
3,"Too long, too mystical","Starts out good,interesting characters,and starts to weave them together well. However, it gets slower, longer, and stretchs your credibility more and more. Needed editing badly. Disappointing."
2,From the corner of his eye,This is definitely not one of Koontz's better books. It is long and drawn out and is difficult to follow. He jumps back and forth from one character to the next. One of his characters in the book you don't even hear about until 25 chapters later after her birth. He should stick to what he does best; horror.Definitely not his best work.
3,"Great action, dull ending","I love Dean Koontz, I have read almost everything he has ever written. And I loved this book -- up until the last 40 or so pages. The story is very good, the action keeps you interested, however the ending is somewhat of a cop-out. This is just my opinion however, and I wouldn't let it stop you from buying or reading this book."
5,Love wins every time,The contrast with good and evil was so intense--I literately detested Junior and loved Barty and Angel and their extended family. Love and faith always wins! Every Dean Koontz book I've read and that's just about every one so far simply transports me into the story--I have a hard time putting it down. So I loved it!
2,What Corner?,I haven't read Dean Koontz in a very long time and now I know why. I don't understand how this book received such great reviews. It was hard to follow and hard to understand. The plot made little sense and it certainly didn't come together in any great way in the end... in fact I skipped over the last forty or fifty pages to get to the end. Yahoo...
1,Tears of boredom in the corners of my eyes.......,"I have read many Koontz books over the years, and this is by far his worst. Read all of the bad reviews here and you'll get the message. It's amazing that from the author of a great book like Watchers comes this dribble. If you insist on reading this book, skip every third paragraph, the entire middle, and the end...you won't miss a thing !!"
3,okay book by okay writter,This is the first dean koontz book that I read. It was fun in some parts. The mystery behind Bartholemew is interesting once it comes into full light. The book became boring though when chapter after chapter is filled with cain's perverted and demented life. Next to nothing is given as to why he just goes crazy. Dean Koontz is just Stephen King with less of an imagination.
1,Are all his books like this,"Being a big history buff, my reading had previously been limited to that Genre. Recently, I have expanded to mysteries, fiction etc. Love Grisham's books, including Painted House...M.Connelly books were good. Decided to try this book... I can't wait til it's over...I feel I am finishing just to see if it somehow comes together. Is this an abberation for him or are they all like this?"
4,Pleasantly surprised.,"I'd been avoiding Dean Koontz for years, which is a pity, since several of his books, such as ""The Watchers"", I rank very highly. The trouble is, is that recently he has got religion badly, such as in ""The Taking"", which started out well, but then deteriorated into a literal Noah's Ark story.I was pleasantly surprised by ""From the Corner of His Eye: A Novel"" (perhaps because it was originally published in 2000?). It was a very engrossing read; I took only a day to finish it. An interesting mix of Parallel Worlds (the Multiverse) and Quantum Physics. Hardly any (or at least not much) religion."
4,Deep Connection Sensed,"Maybe it's because I'm physically disabled, but I really connected with the story here. My mother in particular used to tell me that I could do anything the other kids could do. I just might have to find a different way. Barty definitely found a ""different way"" to live his life.Koontz, being of sound body and (questionably) sound mind, does a brilliant and accurate job of depicting the life of a disabled person. A person so tragically rendered into this world, facing the horrific set of circumstances with courage he doesn't even realize he possesses.After the disappointing book that was FALSE MEMORY (it was disappointing to me, despite critical acclaim) I felt that this book was a refreshing ""come back"" of sorts for Koontz.I would highly recommend that anyone read this book!"
3,Probably my least favorite Koontz,"I've been reading Dean Koontz for nearly twenty years, and I hate to say that this is definitely my least favorite of his novels.I just couldn't relate to the goodiness of the characters. It's like they're not even human.It just feels like there's nothing to connect to here. Koontz has written believable characters with good intentions in the past, but it just feels like he lost all sense of what makes a character sympathetic and likable--it has much more to do with the flaws than the perfection.I'll keep reading, though, in hope that Koontz will get it right again soon."
1,Very disappointed,This was the first Dean Koontz book I've read and I have to say I was quite disappointed. The last thing I would classify it as would be a thriller. I'm hesitant to read another but perhaps if someone could recommend a GOOD one...
1,"Oh, the tragedy!","This book was like marathon sex with no orgasm. The character developement, and plot were great up to a point. The ending was horribly anticlimactic and juvenille. Pitiful. I feel violated having had such high hopes!Bits and pieces of greatness with no real cohesion. Several minor characters and sub-plots were brought together, but not masterfully. Food for thought without the follow-up."
2,Give me the good old days of Koontz,"I agree with the folks who found this book disappointing. I have read every Koontz there is. Even the pen name Koontz and they were ever so much better. I would have enjoyed re-reading ""Whispers"" or ""Watchers"" or any other than this. Keep this book out of the front of your eyes, better yet..... don't even open the book!"
2,The King of letdown endings,"As always, Mr. Koontz spins a fascinating tale that keeps you glued to the pages until the very anticlimatic ending when you close the book and say; ""Did I really just read 600+ pages for THAT?"" My advice, as with any Dean Koontz novel, is to enjoy the story, but stop just before the ending, and use your own imagination to decide how it turns out."
4,Tangling Madness!,"I think the best thing I liked about this thiller was the variety of character's. Koontz was amazing with these folks. I don't think I have ever read a thriller with a character quite like Junior Cain. Talk about physco, this guy is beyond that! Koontz did such a unique job on this maniac. There were times when I would cringe and other where I would laugh over Junior! I really enjoyed the way Koontz wrote small, short chapters, even though the total was 83, it kept you in suspense each time you started a new one. I also enjoyed Tom's character as well as Barty and Angel, both of these children are amazing prodigies, the ending was awesome with what the three of these can see and feel. It will take you into another world. Hats off to Koontz on this novel. This is a must read story, I could write all day about this one, just get it and you will be amazed!"
4,From the Corner of His Eye,"Something more than the usual gore and guts. Despite tragedy and trauma, the people in this world are infused with hope and faith, rare qualities these days. Evil exists here as well, but it is exposed for what evil truly is: dull, ignorant, and ultimately, banal. Yes, evil must be confronted, but it should be dispatched without fanfare and ceremony. Koontz's most positive and spiritual novel yet."
4,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"I can't begin to say how much I enjoyed this novel but I will -- I truly enjoyed this novel and could not imagine putting it down until I finished it. I believe Mr. Koontz is back on track. From the Corner of His Eye reminds me of the old Koontz and he did an excellent job with it. Will there be a continuation? As always, waiting for the next release."
2,Am I missing something??,"This book was a major letdown. The characters are diverse to the point of being ridiculous, and equally unreal. The antagonist (Junior) was impish and his ultimate demise (really...i'm not giving anything away here...Koontz's entire antagonists line-up all end up on the losing end) was a colossal letdown. It's time Koontz stop churning out cookie cutter novels and take some time to write a decent book, like his book Lightening."
1,Huh?,"Okay, I've read a handful of Koontz's books, (really loved Twilight Eyes), and my biggest complaint is that he never kills the main character. (If he has, I must have missed that book) Anyway, this book is so confused. The main ""evil person"" races through the book to meet his nemesis, and then disappears after swapping about two sentences with him, and it's not even at the hands of his nemesis. Huh? And the book is only 3/4 over. You've still got more to read. I must have missed the point of this whole endeavor. Not only do I not recommend this book, but I've yet to meet somebody that does."
1,Could have cut out 100 pages without losing anything,"Well, I have been a fan of Dean Koontz since I picked up ""Dragon Tears"" in an airport bookstore and couldn't put it down. However, this book was a definite disappointment. I neither despised the villian, Enoch Cain, nor liked the heroes, and by page 300 or so, I was willing to shoot Bartholomew myself just to put an end to the story. Koontz suddenly (and unbelievably) brings back Thomas Vanadium after killing him off early in the book, and dispensed with the villain in a couple of paragraphs (making him about the weakest bad guy I've ever seen). The significance of Bartholomew's being able to walk into other parallel worlds was never explained (other than some vague references to quantum physics), and the reasons for Junior's evil nature never become apparent. I'm definitely going to get his next book out of the library and then decide if I want to buy it."
2,Danielle Steel meets Dean Koontz,"This is garbage. Dean, when you run out of things to write, take a vacation or something.This is a cross between Koontz's own Intensity (Junior Cain is a rip-off of the lead in Intensity) and a sappy, disgusting Danielle Steel novel. Koontz, who I considered one of my favorite authors before this piece of junk, bit off a little bit more than he could chew here. He babbles on about ""other worlds"" and parallel universes, and the characters he employs are obnoxious and annoying. The only reason I gave this two stars was that the reader (audiobook) did a decent job considering the crap he was given. I wondered throughout the book whether the reader had to break from time to time to just laugh at how ridiculous this book really is.This would be the worst book I ever read if it weren't for James Patterson's First to Die, which was just Godawful."
3,"Good, not great, another psycho-killer book","I enjoyed this book but in six months I won't be able to remember anything about it. I am a big Koontz fan but this wasn't one of his better books. If you have never a Koontz novel read ""Watchers"". This book devotes a least 500 pages on the killer and his bizarre thoughts and actions. The good guys aren't that well developed (one major character doesn't show up until 3/4 finish) and the book kind of runs out of steam and ends."
3,Bad ending,"I'm a Dean Koontz fan. This is a fantastic book up until the very end of the novel. He builds up so much suspense in the book that it's truly dissatisfying to actually know the end. But a very creative piece of work,nonetheless."
3,"Good start, bad finish","Let me start by saying I've read all of Koontz's work that I know of. His best work is Lightning, The Bad Place, and Strangers. From the Corner of His Eye is an okay read. Koontz's writing is always superb, but the protagonists in this novel are so unbeleivably wholesome that I couldn't relate to any of them. The one antagonist is just a vain, annoying simpleton. However, the beginning of this novel will suck you in, but then you'll keep waiting for it to progress and get better, and it just doesn't happen. This story could have been told in 200 less words. This novel just further exemplifies where DK has gone as a writer. If he would only get back to his roots and start writing truly suspenseful novels like Watchers and the stories I mentioned above, myself and the rest of his original readers would be much happier."
4,I want to live in Dean Koontz's World,"When Angel and Barty finally get together I thought man, this is the stuff that made me love Dean Koontz, remember, how great a read the ""Bad Place"" was, and my all time favarite was ""Cold Fire"" even though I thought ""Tick Tock"" was so very funny, Now The ""Door to December"" was the book that made me love Dean Koontz even more than I already do. I was worried when you wrote the story about the guy who couldn't come out in the sun.(didn't finished that one) I will be writing him a personal note, his address in in the back of The Corner of His Eye. I was smiling at the way he capture the town, the children, and or course the violence. I even love that you and ""Anne Rice"" inculded Black people in your story, thanks we like to read about us in your books (or at least I do). This is a great read I loved how you even had an elderly virgin in this story. Pick it up, and you won't put it down. Peace"
1,"All philosophy, no point","I like to go off and think deep thoughts probably a little more than average. I even enjoy philosophical rantings when they have a point. However, I found this text to have little to no substance. The thoughts were deep but seemed to be more self serving of the author than to have a point."
2,Disappointing,"In today's pace driven world, I was looking forward to a little respite in James Ogilvy's book. Unfortunetely, it didn't deliver for me. What suggests to be a guide to finding creativity and fulfillment, ends up being nothing more than the author's sterile philosophical rantings. Actually, I don't know how it ended since I only made it through half the book. I would have liked less history and more ""evidence"" or anecdotes from the author's life that promote this way of living. Ogilvy wants to sell us on ""goallessness"", but doesn't offer any kind of convincing argument. Too bad, since I would tend to agree with this point of view!!"
5,Brilliant antidote to typical management book drivel.,"Excellent, provocative, thoughtful, and much needed reflection on life and work"
5,just right....,Ordered a pair of these for accent lighting in great room. They look great hanging on the wall. Color matches walls but should go with pretty much any color. They mounted easily and would recommend them....
4,Personal Responsibility!,"This is a valuable book, and particularly so for those who have tried Alcoholics Anonymous and found it ineffective or unworkable. The book stresses personal reponsibility in controlling the consumption of alcohol and, after all, that is the key to controlling all forms of addiction. When it comes right down to it, what else is there? No one else can do it for you."
3,"Very useful, but overall quality seems low","I would probably give this 3.5 stars if it were possible. I like this vision driver and will likely use it often. . .if it holds up. The outside (clear) channel that fits over the screw being driven is manufactured from hard plastic. It almost has a brittle feel to it, like a large plastic pen. Taken as a whole the unit just does not seem very robust. On the other hand, it is a great idea and is useful. There is at least one other version of this type of driver marketed under the brand Vermont American. I have not tried that company's clear driver.This is a decent addition to my tools, but I'm not sure it is worth what I paid for it."
3,Inverter,"I expected a bit more from a 800 watt inverter. I only run a laptop andprinter. This puts a 40 watt draw on this inverter overheating it after 20 minutes.With my laptop needing a full charge, this inverter is incapable of running long enough to meet this meager demand."
3,Satisfactory,"Functionally, it works fine and is easy to use. I have three beefs:1. It isn't really an 800w inverter. It is 700+ watts for a short time and 600+ watts continuous.2. There are no mounting lugs. I was hoping to mount it on the wall in my motorhome but there isn't really anyway to do that unless I want to trust doublestick tape.3. The DC input terminals are bigger and clunkier than they need to be which further limits mounting possibilities.It is a decent amount of inverter for the price."
5,Legend in the making,"All I can say is that I hate it when it is over. I was so excited to hear after Carlas hiatius she had recorded a new album. As soon as it arrived I played it over and over again. This feels like a voice that I have known for a long time, a voice that knows love, a voice that knows life. Her words carry my mind to new places, it makes me fall in love over and over again! Just in it's self her voice is an insturment. This group is a great compliment to one another. I am on my way back to California in a couple of months and hope to catch up with Carla. I look forward to seeing her performance. I had the pleasure of knowing her . I still think of myself as her number one fan! I enjoy sharing her music with my friends and family. Watch out world here she comes."
3,"If you are already a Fan, you'll like this one...","..otherwise, you may or may not like it. I didn't have real strong feelings either way. She's a nice girl with a nice voice, I can say that much."
1,Just dreadful!,"As much fun as sitting in your accountant's office with your lap full of tax receipts. Of course, there are worse things in life, but please, remind me of what they are. Better yet, don't remind me!"
3,NO BIG DEAL FOR 2013 ..,IT &#304;S OK BUT NOT MORE FOR KNITTERS WHO ARE USED TO MODERN KNITTING BOOKS...NO BIG DEAL FOR 2013 KNITTERS BUT I AM SURE IT WAS REVOLUTIONARY AT ITS TIME..
5,The Opinionated Knitter,"This book takes you into the world of Elizabeth Zimmermann. It includes her original hand written notes and graphs, her pithy commentary and some of her personal family pictures. It reads like a diary which it partly is. The patterns are still inventive and wonderful. There are modern day pictures of the Baby Surprise Jacket with new photos of the little sweater in beautiful fibers that were not available in the 60's. A must for any knitting enthusiast's library."
5,Revolution on knitting,"This book is fantastic. The Zimmermann's style is really a revolution on knitting, and her text is refined and mindful."
5,the opinionated knitter,another good book from Elizabeth Zimmerman full of good ideas and a chance to 'know' the author a little better... great style too!
4,"Not all ""undiscovered""","A minor point: the Medtner 'Fairy Tale' was released once before, as part of the 1969 edition of ""The Great Songs of Christmas"" series made by Columbia for Goodyear. In that album, the piece was retitled ""A Christmas Tale for Children"" (to tie it in to the season) and Medtner wasn't credited. But it's a fun little piece and treated well by the maestro."
2,Not very black walnuty...,"I bought these for my husband who loves Black Walnuts and while he was trying to be nice, he finally confessed that they really didn't have much of a BW flavor to them. Too bad."
1,Grange's worst novel,"I have read all of Grange's novels: ""Empire of the Wolves"" is not only the worst of them all, but is just a bad book full stop. The suspense is very gripping until about the middle of the book, and then the plot become completely ridiculous and the end utterly pointless. Don't waste your time and money, but do go and read Grange's other four brilliant novels (not all of them have been translated to English though)."
3,A Tale of Two Books,"The writer begins his book in a most suspenseful manner that kept me glued to the book. The story contains characters that have depth and mystery that leads to a smoothly flowing novel. This is certainly true for the first half of the book. In the second half, it seems as if someone else has been doing th wruting. All of the postives that were introduced to the reader earlier in the book turn into a story that stretches the credulity of the reader. The solid beginning has turned into a rather unrealistic middle and end. The story, which began with so much promise, rapidly evaporates into mediocrity. The book was originally written in French and would have had a smoother flow to it had the translator done more to ""Americanize"" the story in the use of character names. This was, at best, a fair read."
5,Excellent Read!,"I read this book and found it incredibly interesting! They did not portray Ronald Reagan as an idiot, he was an idea man but had no idea how to implement. He sold it! That was his job and that is what he was incredibly good at -America loved him. He had people to do the other stuff. At that time, I guess things were bad enough America needed a little of that. I did not agree with some of the things that went on though beginning with what they did to President Carter -holding the announcement about the hostages being released until after Reagan took the oath of office, even though they had been released earlier that morning. That was dirty. Anyway, this is an excellent book. It's not dry, or boring. It's not technical or hard to understand but it is full of details in an easy to understand format! I started taking notes in the front and back margins of the book! I am going to try another one of Bob Schieffer's books."
4,What a great band,"I first heard about Robert Earl Keen because Lyle Lovett would play some of his songs and refer to him in concert. Then I saw REK open for LL at a show playing a solo acoustic set. Good stuff, very funny.Then I saw REK and his full band live at the Bluegrass Festival in SF in 2004 and wow, they really jam! He has a very tight, talented band, and this DVD showcases it very well. The only shame is that it's so short. ""Amarillo Highway"" is a big highlight, and of course ""The Road Goes on Forever,"" which is his signature song. If you want an introduction to REK, this would be a great place to start."
4,Helpful,This book has changed the way I perform house cleaning. It has helped me streamline the process and definitely improved the results of my efforts. I used to feel like I couldn't keep up with the work and the results were not that great. Now I've learned more efficient ways to clean and get better results.
2,ive read better...,"i've read over 10 guides in this vein. read, 'home maintanance 4 dummies' and jeff campbell's, 'speed cleening' they're the best/clearest."
5,Student Life Application Bible,"Great Bible - easy to use and the kids like it and enjoy the ""extras"""
5,Very Pleased,With a recent $500 price drop whoever buys this tv is getting the best deal around. Perfect for very bright sunny rooms. Showing no glare on the screen and full 1080p resolution makes this a very hard hdtv to beat. As of 8/1/07 I've had mine for 6 months and I'm very pleased with all aspects of this TV. Runs beautifully with the PS3 and PC.
5,Wow!,"Best picture I have seen. Easy to set up. I probably am only using a small portion of it's ability( I don't play games on it, nor is it hooked up to my music system).Kinda a pain to switch to DVD's but the picture is awesome!We have Comcast HD service, the only way to go!The unit is actually smaller than the 35"" mitch it replaced."
1,"Avoid Samsung, Terrible customer service","We bought this TV 5 months ago. Since then, it was nicely sitting in a built-in entertainment center. 2 weeks ago, we found that the TV is tilted, looking like it is going to fall. So, we decided to take it out and see what is going on. When we tried to lift it, the bottom of the stand broke by its own weight. Since it is still under warrenty, I called the customer service to try to get it repaired. I cannot believe what I heard? They said this is physical damage and it is not covered by the warrenty. I don't know how they can have such an unreasonable rule. Is it that Samsung did not make a good stand, so they purposely exclude such problems. My recommendation is, be aware of the warrety trick and the potential of weak construct (or just bad luck). All in all, the worst customer service I ever had."
5,beautiful tv,"Very nice TV - only complaint is limited PC compatibilty, I had some problems using my HP 9000DV with it, I'm hoping a HDMI cable instead of VGA solves the problem."
3,Cautiously Optimistic!,"Good:1. Amazon easy to do business with..honored 2 price reductions within a week. Will match price reductions and give credit for 30 days within purchase date. Will ONLY match Amazon prices--not prices of competitors.2. Price significantly lower than Best Buy and Circuit City sale prices!3. Free shipping/no sales tax.Not So Good:1. Instruction manual lacking in detail.2. Manual shows Picture in Picture mode--is also shown on remote. However, Samsung telephone support reports it is ""virtually impossible""....Hope that other ""features"" will work....3. ""Track your Order"" feature on Amazon and Eagle Shipping was totally ineffective. TV sat in warehouse for one week--multiple phone calls finally got them moving.4. Remote control slow in responding to commands.We are currently operating on cable..and wondering if dish is better. Any suggestions? We'll appreciate ideas, hints, tips!"
5,Absolutely beautiful!,"I spent a good amount of time researching HDTVs, and I am so happy that I decided on this one. I almost went with a Sony Bravia XBR2 but got scared away by the pricetag and the clouding issues they are having with the picture. I am connected to Dish Network (which I highly recommend...great prices and more HD programming than DTV and my local cable company) and have an Oppo upconverting DVD player, both connected via HDMI and the picture is crystal clear, so sharp, and the colors are so vivid. Also have a Nintendo Wii hooked up with component cables which looks pretty amazing too. Standard definition programming looks far better on this TV than other large HDTVs I've seen. The only semi-negative I can think of is that lights reflect on the glossy black frame and can distract your eye from the picture sometimes. But on the other hand, the glossy black is very classy looking and really makes the TV a piece of decor in the house in addition to being a kickass television."
5,Samsung makes a great LCD.,I was a little nervous about purchasing a flat panel LCD online. Needless to say I decided to stick with the reviews concerning the Samsung flatpanels and decided to go with the 46 inch 1080p LCD. I was amazed at how easy the transaction went and when I got my tv less than a week later I was amazed.The picture is outstanding with HD programming and with Blu-ray DVD. Amazing picture. Normal analog pictures are less than desirable but I hear this is common in all flat panels either LCD or Plasma. If you decide to purchase this tv you will make a good choice. Make sure you also get the extended service warranty just to be on the safe side.
5,Incredible TV,"First of all, I was very skeptical about purchasing such a large item onAmazon. Great experience. I ordered the TV on Thursday afternoon, Mondaymorning the Fed Ex guy is ringing my doorbell.The TV is awesome. The picture is even clearer than when I looked at itat the store. It was extremely easy to set up with the monstor cable, andI am not electronicly inclined. It was something anyone could do. The setis very user friendly. Even the programs that are not filmed in HD areso much clearer. I never realized how much more of the background, likepeople in the 20th row at a basketball game, that you can see.Lastly, the tv was not my idea. I was talked into it by my husband. Thepurchasing was my deal. I saved at least 500-600 dollars by buying iton Amazon. I am recommending this method to all of my friends."
5,Worth every penny,"I recently purchased this TV and love it. I feel as though I'm sitting in a theatre when I watch it. Both HDTV and standard broadcasts, including black & white movies, are a pleasure to watch. I have had no problems with delivery, setup, or operation. As far as ""ghosting"", color, or contrast problems go, I have not encountered any. As happens there is always the possiblity of getting a ""lemon"" with any manufacturer, so I can understand the frustration of those individuals who wind up with a defective product.I have purchased two Samsung LCD's, a 23"" and the LN-S4695D, and both have performed flawlessly. As far as comparisons to Sony go, I believe Samsung and Sony share the same LCD manufacturing facilities."
3,"Not bad, but not perfect","I use this tv for hdtv gaming with the xbox360 and PS3, and for that purpose it is well suited. As I was concerned with burn-in using plasma, this seems to be the best lcd on the market within this price range.With that said, this price range doesn't seem too reasonable if you're using this tv for movies/tv viewing, as this unit doesn't seem to handle black colors all that well. Putting the energy saver on medium or high seems to help, but this does darken the overall picture a bit. Don't get me wrong it's still a good tv, and you will of course be impressed with hdtv vs. standard, but if you've already made the jump previously to hdtv, you may want to opt for a 720p plasma unit and save a little dough."
5,Awesome TV!,"Bought the TV a week back after months of agonizing over Sony XBR and Samsung, and I am glad of the choice I made. It's probably the best LCD tv I came across with eye-opening contrast. The picture is exceptionally clear, even for the SD programs. Obviously, I can't test 1080p, but its a probably a good thing to have for 'future-proofing'. ( I did see a Samsung demo of 1080p on this model...its quite impressive).The native resolution of 1920x1080 also works great for connecting to PC. Movie Picture mode produces great black levels comparable to Plasmas.Advantages -1. Great looking - elegant.2. 1080p with 1980x1080 native resolution.3. Great dynamic contrast ratio - 6000:14. Separate Game mode.5. Great even for SD.6. 8 ms response time7. less expensive than XBR.Disadvantages -1. The only difference I could think of between Bravia XBR and this one is 2 HDMI inputs instead of 3 for BRAVIA. Not a big deal for me.Overall - I love it."
4,"Great TV, even greater price","We saw this TV at one of the big electronics stores and thought it had the best picture of any in the store. Glad we checked Amazon, as we saved over $700. With the HD cable box, the HD channels available have some incredible programming that look great on this TV. Exceptional viewing angle, sound is acceptable, though considering adding a surround sound system for better sound. Easy to hook up and get started with."
1,Picture Great / Warranty Service Unacceptable,"We purchased the set in December 2007. Excellent picture and sound quality. By March, light colors appeared speckled and grainy. By June, after warming up for 30-45 minutes, the picture was completely distorted.We called for service on September 29. The in-home tech arrived on November 7 with a replacement board. He tested the set in front of my wife, and it worked (while cool). Within an hour, my wife turned the TV back on.... no LCD at all. We called the service center and they told us the installed part was bad. On 12/5, the new part was available and installed. Same problem. I escalated the issue with Samsung, and they told me that the service provider had to order a power supply. In the meantime, no working TV since September."
5,Great picture for great price...,"After doing a lot of research online and at local retailers, I was going to buy a 42"" plasma until I saw a demo of this 46"" LCD with 1080p.Product arrived on West Coast 7 days after placing order.I mounted the unit on the wall. I've had the TV 2 weeks now and just got the HD package from Direct TV, Amazing picture. As other have mentioned speakers are not the best, but just hook it up to an external amp.Price has already dropped another $90.00 since my purchase and was $700 cheaper than local major stores when I purchased it."
1,Stand broke,"The neck of my Samsung LN-S4695D supplied TV stand broke after 8 months and the 75 pound TV came crashing to the floor. Others have reported the same problem, the neck is all plastic and cannot support the weight of the TV. I have to give their service 5 stars they replaced the TV with a brand new LN-T4661F which has a stronger neck and stand."
1,Don't buy JUNK,"I bought two of these units and neither worked. I can understand if one item has a problem,but two? Obviously they either have no or completely ineffective quality control. Timex used to be a reliable product."
1,Poor solder connections,"Purchased this thermometer and it worked well for a day. Then segments of the display stopped working (as reported by others). I opened the case (four tiny screws) and discovered a ribbon cable with a dozen (or so) connections to a printed circuit board. Pushing on various connections at the end of the cable would light up the malfunctioning segments but not permanently. Soldering ribbon cable is very tricky (too much heat will melt the cable) and I was unsuccessful at restoring the broken connections. Finally threw the thermometer away and got the Oregon Scientific THT312, which is working great. I'm very disappointed at Timex quality control."
1,Broken out of the box (twice),The first one I received was broken out of the box. The display showed missing segments from the digits. I returned it to Amazon for replacement and the replacement unit has the same malfunction. Neither unit had any signs of physical damage. After that I just returned it for refund and bought an Oregon Scientific unit which has been great.
1,Disappointed,"Bought TWO of these thermometers from timex. Come packaged brand new as expected from amazon. What was not expected is that i would be completly disappointed in the quality control of this product.. Just like the other review by ""jimbo"" neither of my two thermomters worked, not displaying the LCD characters correctly, or at all. Tried several different new batteries with no luck."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"I did not expect much for $10 and I did not get anything but two partial numbers on the dial -- I could have returned it but it was not worth it, so I just wrote it off -- this is the first item I have got from Amazon that did not work."
4,Great.,"Anything by Rod Serling is a treasure, but these are best seen in their origninal form as TV plays. Still, it's great to see his writing in any form."
2,knee brace,Not very comfortable on my knee and it keeps moving around so I have to constanstly keep repositioning it.
2,Not working for me either,I heard about this product from several people and bought one for my mom and one for me.Our knees do not look like the one pictured so this product does not work for either of us!I believe in the concept - but feel that there should actually be more then one size for it.
1,Worthless,"Perhaps it's that this product is not designed to alleviate pain for knee pain in the front, below the knee cap, which is why I purchased it. If it is, I found it to b ineffective. My knee sleeve provides far more relief."
2,How does it work?,"I don't understand where the Kneed-it, was supposed to hold. It didn't hold my knee straight at all and didn't help me with the pressure. I felt like this didn't help me at all, and I had to return it."
5,KneedIT does the trick!,I had already used a KneedIT Therapeutic Knee Band on my right knee when I decided that I should give my left knee some support as well. It has helped me to continue to play tennis which I enjoy so much. I recommend it highly.
2,"Looking good, but nothing more then that","In short good idea but poor implementation.The whale point of this device is that it holds the knee cup into the place, however the opening is very narrow and plastic is too harsh, so there is no way to adjust it to user's knee cup size and as such is useless.The strap is cutting into the leg, also since it's not Velcro it won't stretch while you walk, and as a result it pulls the plastic down.Not worth it. I'm returning it."
1,Very Disappointed!,"I first used the Kneedit Bands over 7+ years ago. They were much more expensive - $45.00 each, but were better built. I wore them every time I worked-out and when I knew I would be walking for an extended period of time. I had to replace them due to the velcro wearing out, which seemed normal.I was surprised at how much the price had reduced since the last time I purchased the bands. Within the 1 week, the white plastic piece that you slide the velcro throught to tightened the band broke. I no longer use either band because they do not hold in place as well as my 1st pair. I am very disappointed at the quality of this product compared to 7+ years ago. Cheaper is not always better!I will not use this product again nor will I recommend it to anyone else. Very disappointed!"
2,dON'T pull too tight...it'll break,"The kneed-it has the best shape to lock the patella, but you must have it tightly secured. To do this you need to pull it tight! The plastic snapped off, where the velcro loops. You need to be very careful with it. I wish it was better plastic."
2,Poor construction,The plastic loop for the product's velcro strap broke off after about 30 games/practices or roughly two months after purchase.
4,Great Aid,I have really bad knees and am still playing baseball at age 68. I like it that this is not a big burdensome brace.
5,Another Great Book,"The author Hans Wilholm has written several delightful books featuring this cute little white moppet dog. Children will want to read all the books. Another book features this dog getting lost and one shows the dog losing a tooth. These are all subjects children can relate with.The doggie is forced to get a haircut he doesn't want. After being sheared, he is very sure all of his friends will laugh at him for being different. How comforting to find out his friends accept him for who he is."
4,A reluctant dog gets a haircut and makes the best of it!,"My daughter and I had a great fun with this. This is a great book for praticing reading aloud with expression in your voice. We were both laughing at her voice and the expressive illustrations. Because the text was easy, she was able to focus on 'how' she read, not 'what' she read."
1,Cheap product and expensive,"First of all I have never purchased anything so cheap from Amazon...such a disappointing product. The description is very misleading...they've advertize as a high quality product an alternative to the more expensive glass sterling silver products. I had to return it immediately do to a defect, customer service was good. My mother-n-law gave us a better quality product for much less! Stay away"
3,Suction Cups Fall off too easily,"Boatmates - Shower ToteI really like this product for use at the gym. The suction cups allowed me to place the tote on the wall in a place where it wouldn't get too wet. Unfortunately, the suction cups fall off too easily and less than 1 month after having it, I have lost 2 of the suction cups and can no longer use it in that manner. So now the tote gets all wet or it gets hung up outside the shower and is inconvenient."
5,Right product and fast delivery,"The Outdoor Store got my Generac oil filter to my house within a few days, which is very important during hurricane season in the South."
3,Just get milk thistle,You don't need the extras in this product. The only supplement you need to take for liver health and detoxification is milk thistle. It's cheaper when you buy it without the added extras.
3,Hard to define metrics to evaluate this,"This product has received raving reviews but as a healthy person who drinks alcohol occasionally, I thought that using this product may help in thwarting any liver diseases or degeneration.But that may be highly suspect. Since I have had no blood tests, nor any liver problems to worry about as yet, I can't say if this product has done more harm than good, or simply acted as a placebo.The capsule is a bit tough to swallow and you can 'feel' it in your throat after it has gone down.Unless you believe you can derive a benefit out of a product like this, trying it simply to see if something happens is likely to disappoint you."
5,Nice Blend of Herbs for a Good Price,"I looked around for a while to see what made up all the different liver detox formulas. It seems to come down to Milk Thistle, Dandelion, and Grape Seed. Knowing that, it's easy to find a good blend with some extras that is reasonably priced. NOW Foods is a leader in terms of formulations and prices."
2,Too underdosed to be effective.,"This is a solid list of ingredients, however you would need to take about triple the recommended dose daily to gain any benefit."
3,Liver Detox,"To be honest, I haven't felt a difference at all, what I find regarding vitamins, etc. is, that you really need to do your research, unfortunately there are allot of fake reviewers out there, but sometimes you need to try it for yourself, now foods has great prices, I'd question their quality rating, switched pretty much all my vitamins, etc to the Jarrow Formulas brand, that's not an endorsement and I'm sure there are even higher quality products out there, but for quality/money they are better than Now foods."
5,"Been taking this for three months, and just got new liver tests. I am in the normal range again.",My topic says it all. My ALT was 58 and is now 45. It's within normal range. I attribute this to the fact I have been taking these supplements for three months now and will continue.
1,Save Your Money,"This collection of short stories is uneven at best, and only sporadically entertaining. Everything that made Trevanian one of my favorite authors is all but absent in this book. If these stories were indeed written over a period of years, they belong back in the author's reject file, where they must have come from. If they are all new, so much the worse. I can't imagine that an author who hadn't already proven his marketability could persuade a publisher to foist this thin gruel upon the reading public.I am willing to follow a favorite author through any number of genres, but not when he abandons the quality of writing that made his work so delightful and readable.If you must buy this book, wait for it to appear on the sale table."
3,De facto autobiography,"Since ""Trevanian"" is merely an avatar for the various literary moods of Rod Whitaker, retired University of Texas film professor, he is unlikely to pen his own autobiography. Therefore, this slim volume of short stories will have to suffice. We see throughout aspects of the Trevanian style and content that inform his novels. I suspect that the story about the young lad and his guilty dismissal of a lonely old woman is authentic memoir. Too many of Trevanian's protagonists begin as penniless youths for this to be coincidental. Similarly, we have the near-pickup in the bar as a possible confession of what it is like to be a randy, middle-aged professor whose bright-minded self-awareness plunges him into ironic anhedonia. I'm sure you've got the idea that this book is best read by aficionados."
2,Hot Night in the City,"Trevanian's acknowledged brilliance makes you wonder here about the man himself. The same person who wrote that masterful parody, The Loo Sanction is nowhere apparent in HNITC. What makes a genius writer portray himself through his own works as a ""...thing writhing in the coffin,"" as Stoker described Dracula. Isn't there some honor among authors to write to please an established audience. HNITC gives this heretofore avid fan a feeling of betrayal. A voyeur husband watching the PI's hidden camera- views of his wife wallowing in bed with an elderly gnome. I wonder now why the 2 star rating I gave this ...? And now I am at a loss to arrive at the correct noun."
1,Betrayed,"Trevanian was my favorite author. Then I bought ""Hot night in the city"". Trevanian has now sunk to the level of Stephen Queen(King), who has his wife write the novel and then signs it with his name so it will sell. I will never buy a new Trevanian or King novel again!"
5,"""Snappy""","These are my first pair of Florsheims - I always thought they were kind of ""old-man"" shoes - and I really love them. They fit perfectly, feel great and the leather sole is soft not slippery so you don't slip and slide the first few time you wear them. And boy do they look snappy. These things are a steal at this price. I'll be looking into more Florsheims shortly."
3,"OK, but not the best.","This book lacked the usual suspense and exitement of most Mandie Books. The most interesting thing that happened was that Mandie, Joe and Celia got locked in the church basement. Read it just to keep up with the series, otherwise it is very dull and rather boring."
2,Boring until the last chapter.,Okay so I wasn't very pleased with this book and I'm so glad I bought it as a Goodwill and only paid fifty cents for it. The book was boring until the last chapter which is the one that gave it the second star. Without that chapter it would be a one star book.The book starts off with Mandie and Celia having to solve the mystery of why the bells at the church are ringing the wrong number of times. Most of the locals think it is a bad omen espically when the flu breaks out and a big snowstorm comes. When Mandie and Celia solve who is behind the ringing of the bells they have another mini-mystery to solve. At the end of the book it leaves it open for the next book in the Mandie series.The characters were all okay. The one I loved the most had to be Ben. In the book it is set way back and so the black people are still servants and men seem to be the main provider of the household.Penny Lane
4,Disapointed,"I was disapionted with the end of the book. All through the story the group makes lots of trips to the church and finds things that don't add up. At the end they find the person by chance, and he explains every thing. All they needed to do through the whole story was find the person who did it. Leppard sounded as though she didn't plan ahead so she fixed it all up at the end."
2,review,I feel for the children involved in this book and hope life works out for them. The story was good but I found it to be questionable. The author was the only person who had a fourm to speak. I am sure there is another side to this story. There always is. I would have liked to hear all sides of it so I could get a better picture of what I'm suppose to be looking at. I hope that the children involved don't know about about this book. I can imagine the pain that it would cause them. The pain is not deserved and could damage them for a long time. I will pray for everyone involved
2,Expectations not met.,"First, I will start with the positive, i like how the soap leaves my skin feeling clean. Now for the negatives, it does not clear up breakouts & maybe even causes them. I was hoping the soap would help with dark spots but so far no results & i have used the soap regularly for about a month now. Just not the results i expected."
1,Horrible and Fake Black Soap!!,"So I order this soap because of all the good reviews and let me tell you its horrible!! One bar lasted 5days, mind you I shower twice a day. It DRIED my skin out!! My husband thought it smelled! Dont be fool, I've been using real Black Soap and this Ambi Black Soap is garbage!! Do yourself a favor and order real Black Soap you will notice the different. I will never go back to regular soap!! I rather pay $23-$30 for 12bars of real black soap, then $2-$3 a bar for Ambi Black Soap. Just my 2cents!!"
1,Stinks,"This book stinks. First, it lies--of the several hundred Beach Boys songs written, it covers perhaps 30. Second, the selection is awful--it includes songs I've never heard of, while excluding masterpieces like ""God Only Knows,"" ""Heroes and Villains,"" and ""You Still Believe in Me."" It acts as if ""Pet Sounds"" and everything following never happened. Third, its harmonies are often flat wrong (check out ""Catch a Wave"" and prepare to be horrified). Fourth, it ignores all vocal parts except the melody, even the most obvious echo lines. Fifth, there's a picture of ""the Beach Boys"" on the cover, and Brian isn't included--enough said! This is a book for grandmothers who want to plunk at the piano in the parlor and sing ""Surfer Girl"" to themselves."
4,lomax the songhunter,"Interesting film filmed in retrospective after Lomax had had a stroke. Interesting footage and interviews with original folk artists that Lomax had recorded. Was good to see the few clips of original footage that were included.Focuses on a few folk artists in different parts of the world that Lomax had originally recorded long before. .artists of a dying song tradition.Personally was hoping for more footage of the prison recording sessions made in the southern states penitentiary, but the whole film was interesting and uplifting highlighting the power of music and it's traditional function in labour."
4,Great for seniors,"I bought this dvd for my 57 year old mother who has never before used a computer system and, in fact, thought should could break a computer just by touching it. These, along with the other dvds in this series, have now transported my computer-fearing mother into the 21st century. The dvds aren't meant to be just played in a dvd player to watch - the key is to have the person watching the dvd at an actual computer while watching the dvd. The narrator speaks extremely slowly, almost painfully slowly if you are just watching the dvd. However, the narrator expects you to be physically following along at a computer and mimicking what is being taught and in order to do that, must speak slowly so that people have enough time to follow. In all, this series is a must have for seniors who are looking to get into getting over their fears of using a computer."
5,tells you what you need to know,I travel around New England regularly and usually have a fly rod in my car. It is always frustrating when I have a couple of hours of free time and I spend it trying to figure out where to fish instead of spending it fishing. This book has all you need to know to find a spot and catch (and hopefully release) some fish. Unlike some books the authors don't limit themselves to only one kind of fish or claim that every spot they talk about is going to rival the best place you've ever fished. Highly recommended for anyone who gets the privilege of fishing in New England!
4,J B of Paso Robles CA.,"If you have to move machines around in your shop like I do, Then this is a must have.Mounted my Delta drill press on it. First put a 3/4 piece of ply in frame as a base to bolt too. Machine weight is 194 lbs so a base that holds 500 lb. is over kill.Got the Hgp-14 instead of HGP 15 because it's a bit wider and steadier.Also free shipping on model 14 not the model 15 {STRANGE}Have bought a Delta base for my bandsaw, That feels much less sturdy and cost more.I'm happy ""Look this one over""John"
4,"HTC HGP-14 Mobile Base used with Delta 15"" drill press","I used a piece of 3/4"" plywood cut to fit and fill the entire space on the Mobile Base. I then placed my Delta 15"" drill press on top. I had intended to bolt the drill press to the board, and the board to the mobile base, but that isn't necessary. It is very stable, moves very easily, and I'm very pleased and happy with my purchase."
3,The First One Arrived Bent,"The first one that was sent to me was packaged by sandwiching the original thin box between two pieces of cardboard. When it arrived, it was folded in the middle, and since this is a metal gasket, it was bent. Considering the amount of work it takes to install an oil pan gasket, I didn't want to try straightening the gasket and hope for the best. I called Amazon customer service and asked if they could ship a replacement in a real box, but the representative told me she didn't have the ability to request special packaging. I went ahead and requested a replacement anyways, and, much to my surprise, the replacement came in a real box, and is as straight as could be."
3,One Time Use Only,If you are looking for a pair of fishnets to wear one time (ie. Halloweend) these are the perfect and economical choice. But they are not going to last for much longer than that.
4,Worked for Me,Luckily I ordered these....the piece of crap hoisery I wanted to wear shredded the moment I put them on. These worked like a charm!
1,Cheap; Tears Easily,Wore these as part of a Halloween costume. I had a run the first (and only) time I wore them. I threw them away the same night.
3,high hopes,I bought this as a replacement for the replacement of a replacement for an identical boat seat. All have broken right above the hinge bracket on the back. My fishing partner has broken all three of the seats. Hope this will last a whole lot longer since I won't let him sit in a seat anymore.
4,It has some good points,"There is a large cloud over this author because of his conduct. But none the less, I enjoyed this book and think its worth the effort to keep an eye & mind open and read the book."
2,Does not work with Vista 64,"I purchased this because it said it would work with Vista but it turns out it will not work with the 64bit version of Vista, which is what I have on my laptop. However, I have found that it will install on XP and Vista 32 (but this was on my desktop and not where I will be using it). Also, the latest driver on their website is from 2004. It would have saved me alot of trouble if they said it would not work with Vista 64 upfront."
5,broad appeal,"I bought this for my two-year old (he doesn't really put things in his mouth so I wasn't overly concerned, but there ARE a lot of small pieces... wouldn't have worked with my older one). He LOVES it. So does his 4 year-old brother. Even my 11-year old nephew couldn't leave it alone when he came over. I love the way the animals move and look so realistic instead of being cartoonish or flat wood like other sets. One of our giraffe's has had its leg come off a couple times, but it snaps back on easily. So versatile; it's provided many hours of entertainment!"
5,Fantastic toy to help develop young minds!,"I am a huge fan of Playmobil, grew up playing with them myself, and I am so glad I invested in this toy for my daughter's seventh bday. Now, the toy is a bit pricey but it is worth every penny! The toy comes with loads of accessories and animals, it is easy for little hands to set up the animals in the ark thus cutting down frustration. The ark does float but not that well when it is loaded with all the animals and accessories, said this my daughter loves to play with it at bath time."
1,Hundreds of pieces!,"Let me start by saying I have not assembled this toy nor have I given it to my grandson yet. That being said, I ordered it because of all the wonderful reviews. Maybe the toy will be fun after assembly, but there should have been SOME indication that the ark comes in a HUGE box filled with many rattling pieces. I fear that my son will not even be able to fit this into his car to take home after Christmas. The parents will probably want me to keep the toy here because it's got so many small pieces."
3,Stories that will make you scared,"This is a collection of R.L. Stine's spookiest stories. And some of them are really scary. My favorite story that scared me the most was ""Losers"" because i want to remind the bullies at my school, IF THEY CALL ME A LOSER, THEY'RE GONNA BE HUMILIATED ONE DAY. Because it's a about kids who disrepect other kids, and what happens to them? They become the laughing stock of the carnival.STORIES:Halloween Dance: Creepy, talking about what happens when you die 8/10The Bad Babysitter: Wierd, but enjoyable. About a babysitter who hurts kids with a making a minature cookie that looks like their faceAnd there's alot more. But I'm not gonna give it away. Good book, read it."
5,The Haunting Hour,"_The Haunting Hour_ by R.L.Stine was very suspenseull and full with horror. When Amber's dad brings home an antique trunk that she doesn't want to take on her cruise, that night she hears a voice saying ""take me with you."" At first she just thinks it was a nightmare, but later a ghost comes out of the trunk and into her body since Amber declares that she won't take the trunk on her cruise. Amber was so mad at her dad for not listening to her. Then when she gets on the cruise ship, the cruise ship is there...is her cruise gonig to be a disaster?"

1,Not what it should be,"I bought this Mp3 player because of its compact size for working out at the gym. Unfortunlety, I have spent more time trying to get the darn thing to work than working out at the gym! I am good with mp3 players and have had many before, but I have had nothing but problems with this one and I should have done the smart thing at the start and returned it instead of trying to make it work. Save yourself the trouble and spend the extra on the Ipod.....The savings isnt worth the effort on this Mp3 player."
1,Review of Sandisk MP3 player,"Inferior product, not recommended.Does not support playlists.Controls were difficult and inconvenient."
1,Too Pricey for non expandable MP3 player,I cant even imagine what the boy wonders at Sandisk marketing are thinking. Here we have a non-expandable MP3 player which is about $150!!! Either buy a Creative 4GB MP3 for about $100 or go for the EXPANDABLE Lexar Jumpdrive MP3 for $30. You can then add your own memory...Some doofus claims that the public wants non-expandable players. nonsensical!! if the expandable player is less why not buy that !!
1,You Get What You Pay For (And Sometimes Less),"PRO: It was cheapCON: It was CHEAPI kept this SanDisk MP3 player less than 24 hours before shipping it back. The manufacturing quality was exceptionally poor. Controls, particularly the ""joy stick,"" were tiny and difficult to use. Menus seemed to pop up randomly and were nearly impossible to navigate. The screen was hard to read. Finally, the manuals (both the one included in the box and the one on the disk) were the worst I have ever seen"
1,"High hopes, but. . .","Bottom line - it doesn't stay on.Bought the player to use on flights, etc., and wanted one that would use a removable (vs. permanent but rechargeable) battery, and that had lots of storage space. The Sandisk player fit the bill perfectly and I was happy that I found it. It arrived, I filled it with mp3s and took it on a trip.I pressed play, it turned itself off after about 7 seconds. This went on for about 10 minutes as I tried to figure out what I was doing wrong. Bought new batteries thinking the one that came with it was no good, but the same thing happened - it either won't come on or will only stay on for 3-5 seconds before shutting itself off. Very frustrating.I'm going to give it another chance though - I'm returning this one and will evaluate it's replacement as it really does have all the features I'm looking for. I'll post another review with the results. In the meantime, caveat emptor."
1,Swapmeet Quality,"Build Quality: I open the package and the first thing I notice is this item is small and very lightweight. Small is good, lightweight can also be good unless you sacrifice quality to save a 100th of an ounce and increase your profit margin. Don't be fooled by the metallic looks to it. It's made of plastic... a plastic that has a very cheap feel to it.Earbuds: I load a few MP3s (very easy to do) and stick the earbuds into my ears... felt kind of funny... take a look at the photo I posted... it shows one earbud cord was over a foot longer than the other.Sound Quality: I can deal with the cheap feel to it and I can go buy some new earbuds... but the main reason I returned this item to Amazon was beacuse of the annoying static while playing MP3s. There wasn't noise while playing the FM radio. I didn't bother to try the voice recorder. After reading the positive reviews maybe I just got a lemon but I'm not going to give SanDisk another chance."
1,Please dont waste your dough on this,"I was mostly pleased with this player, it was my first one. It was cheap, had decent storage capabilities, and came with an arm strap. I tried to ignore the fact that it constantly froze, but that got hard after it would freeze EVERY time it was turned on. After I fumbled around with it for a couple hours using what little computer knowledge I have, I fixed that. But soon after, the power button got stuck down, and then to turn the unit on it had to be pressed very firmly in just the right spot. As bad as that was, the button then got completely stuck, so there was absolutely no way to turn on the player.It seems like a pretty good deal, about $100 for a gigabyte. The price of players just like these is constantly dropping. Don't settle for this piece of rubbish when there are many more reliable players out there for the price. If you can find it in your heart to ignore all the good reviews you will not regret it. DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,Problems with folders,"I am having the same issue as others have reported where if you have more than 15 or so folders, the player will display all the folders as empty however if you look at it as a USB device in Windows, all the songs and folders are. I called SanDisk support and they determined it was an issue with my particular player and shipped me a new one but it is having the same problem as my original one. Has anyone had any luck with SanDisk support?"
3,POOR SOUND,"I was looking for a mp3 player that I could use while running or biking I settled on this player because of the price and the large 1 gig drive, it is very easy to use the only problem I have with it is the sound quality, I tried several ear phones thinking that it might be the phones but with the 4 ear phones that I tried the sound was at best was poor, if you are an audiophile do not buy this. I think Sandisk needs to think about sound quality when producing a mp3 player. I do have the Rio Karma and the sound on that player is perfect."
4,Satisfied Purchaser.,"Very good performance. It has good fidelity and big enough storage capacity for teenager needs. I bought one for each of my children, aged 13, 17 and 19. They are satisfied. Sometimes I have used them with FM stations during my running practices, with good hearing, unnoticeable weight and easy handling (arm band)."
4,"great, but no way to hold it",I love this MP3 player EXCEPT that the little plastic case that came with it ripped almost immediately. So then I tied a string to the little plastic (not metal) loop on top. This then broke as well. So now I have a really hard time carrying it while I run. No way attach it to me and no protective holder.BUMMER
3,Looks good but...,"This player is good for the price. It looks pretty attractive but there are a few flaws which you should be aware of. First of all, the sound quality is not remarkable. It just sounds okay. The included earbuds suck. The build quality is pretty acceptable but not rugged enough. This player has no In-Line recording.I played with it for a week and returned the player today. I am going for the Samsung YP-MT6Z, which has a better build quality, sounds brilliant with just the included earphones and It has in-line recording.Good Luck!"
2,Difficult to use menu,"I really like the features, but the poorly designed menu makes it very difficult to use.Unless mine is not functioning properly, it will not change from one album or book to another, the language default seems to be Chinese or Russian and it easily returns to one of those. Mine is in Russian at the moment and I can't read Russian to figure out how to get it back to English.I will have to return this product and hope to find one a little easier to use."
2,disappointing,"I had high hopes for this mp3 player. It's cheaper than the iPod and does everthing I'd like, but play SD cards.Good points:-small-light-nice to look at-lots of features-great battery lifeBad points:-user interface is complicated-player crashes constantly when I try to pull up the folder list-impossible to alter the playback orderI've been trying to listen to an audio book, and it keeps playing the tracks out of order. I can't figure out why. You can try to correct it by using the jukebox software, but sometimes it still chooses the wrong order no matter what you do.I want to like it! However, it does such a good job of making me frustrated that I'm thinking of selling it and getting an iPod mini."
4,Excellent product/price combination,"I received the Sandisk 1GB for Christmas and overall, I'm happy with it. The main reasons I bought it were because it's a memory-based player (taking it to the gym) with a huge 1GB of storage space, it has an FM tuner, and because of the price. I don't need 5GB worth of space on a player for my hour and a half workout. Also, there aren't too many other 1GB flash based players in the $150 range. So this one looked perfect for me.As for the player itself, I was very surprised at how small and light it was. It has a ton of settings you can go through if you're really picky about things like scroll speed, for example. The pdf manual that comes on the CD clearly explains everything I needed to know. You don't really need to install any kind of software to use it because Windows XP will recognize it as a removable drive as soon as you plug it in. Then it's just a matter of drag and drop.4 stars because it doesn't support OGG. :)"
1,ABSOLUTELY A PIECE OF TRASH,"I am not sure where to start with this POS! I am returning this to Amazon as it died after about 2 hrs of use. It wont power up with the battery or when attached to my computer.The 2 hrs of use I did get were VERY POOR! The volume is too low, the headphone jack was almost too tight for ANY headphones, the plastic case didnt fit properly, the software you get had to be upgraded (for a price of course) to use all the library functions, very poor backlight, joystick is hard to operate.I could go on and on, I am just glad this died now instead of a few months from now!AVOID SANDISK MP3 PLAYERS!AVOID SANDISK MP3 PLAYERS!AVOID SANDISK MP3 PLAYERS!AVOID SANDISK MP3 PLAYERS!AVOID SANDISK MP3 PLAYERS!AVOID SANDISK MP3 PLAYERS!"
1,Froze i am returning this,"Caution buyer beware!!! This mp3 player was great at first but then it Froze. When it did this i couldnt change songs or shut it off, and the music stopped. You have to remove battery to start it going again. I just purchased the 1gb samsung mp3 player because samsung is a trusted brand."
2,1 GB audio recorder & MP3 player 2 hard 2 use.,"The non-intuitive interface and small size of the buttons makes this unit hard to learn & use. I copied a bunch os music files from my MAC easily but then the unit would not boot up (turn on) completely. I had to delete from the MAC any non-MP3 files I copied. The control wheel is not, it is really just a very small joy stick."
2,Ver poor,I HAVE A HAD A VERY HARD TIME USING THIS MP3 PLAYER. IS IT VERY STATICY AND VERY HARD TO USE. PLEASE DONT BUY. A BIG WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY
4,great little player,"I have had my player for 1 month and just love the thing. It took a little effort to learn how to use it, but once that was done it is a piece of cake. I found that it is a far better bargain than an i-pod. When you find out that the batteries on an i-pod only last about 2 years before they have to be replaced, at a cost of around 60 to 70 dollars. Rechargeable aaa batteries and the charger are only around 10 dollars. Big difference."
3,Works fine but...,"I will keep it short and sweet.Pros:1. Works right out of the box WITHOUT the software using WMP 9 and XP.2. Sound is good, nice equalizer.3. Menu is a bit confusing but read and fiddle and you will figure it out.Con1. It will not save your synched music in the order you told it to. It files everything alphabetically according to artist. So if you just let it play you will hear all the songs by a particular artist all in a row, instead of mixed in with other songs. I use it in my car so this is annoying because I can't take my hands and attention off of driving to skip songs I don't want to hear.I wished I had returned it in time and spent the extra $50 on an iriver."
1,Constant Issues,We bought the MP3 for our 15 year old son and it had issues from day one. We sent it back as the screen was bad. It continually lost songs or would erase whole folders. The control buttons were small and hard to navigate. Their tech department was of little help with issues. We finally got an Ipod instead.
3,worked at first,so the player worked at first but after a couple months just broke so i wont be buying anything refurbished again.
2,Good for play but very bad for record,"Good sound, easy menu and controls, but the mic (in version 2) is very sensitive making the sound distorced. I think it doesn't have AGC (automatic gain control). If you want to use it as a voice record, forget it. It's better as a surveillance mic."
4,sandisk mp3 review,Very easy to use and good size. The only negative are the headphones provided--they do not have very good sound.
5,You wash and dry it and it still works!! Solidly build,"I have more than 4 SDMX1s all of them are very solidly build. Of course by accident over the years, I dropped them, washed them with in Hot Water Cycle, Dried in a drier ... they got a little body damage but they still work!! Amazing!"
5,SanDisk 1 GB MP3 Player Silver,Fantastic product! I jog 10 miles every day and this is my motivator and companion! Sound is great and easy to use.
3,moving on,"I have the 512 version of this player for a year. It worked well, but the buttons are so small, navigation was a big problem. My sister tried to use it in the hosp, I just loaded 5 hours of sleepy music,and she couldn't run the buttons. My advice, buy the one with the larger buttons!sound was great, like using the camera cable from the computer. will buy sandisc again, just not this small."
1,A Navigation Nightmare,"First off, the small LED screen makes difficult navigation of menus. Product manual is terrible. A great effort is made by San Disk as to how to install the battery, but you really have to download the full manual as the one provided is not adequate. Mine will not play in random. Oddly enough, only the first 15-20 songs will play when I try to do so. I think this is a piece of techno-junk. Too hard to navigate and the small switches are unpredictable as to how long you depress them and when. I pretty much dislike it and plan to upgrade to a larger, non-San Disk player. Customer service is good, but suggestions are usually flawed. I say avoid this player."
2,so-so.,"A lot of little annoyances turn this otherwise passable mp3 player into a hassle. It takes about 20-30 seconds to turn on. It doesn't immediately start playing so you have to hit play again after it starts. It doesn't remember the volume you last set. It has a quirk with the sorting of wma drm files. I loaded a drm-ed audiobook onto it with filenames in the form of ""audobook-##.wma"", but the files were ordered randomly. It was fairly difficult to find out which file I wanted to play next, because the filename scrolling is poorly designed and incredibly slow at the fastest speed setting. The radio and voice recording features are useless. The controls can be difficult to use and the menus are a tangled labyrinth of despair.I wish I had bought a different mp3 player, but it's not bad enough that I have to buy a better one."
5,So Far.... A Little Good Machine,"I received my player yesterday from Amazon. Inserted the battery and attached the player to the computer using the USB cable (battery and cable included). Transferred the music files to the player using Windows Explorer and got it up and running in no time. No software installed. So far, I love it. Easy to transfer files and easy to operate. The sound is good too. The only bad thing that I could find about the player is that the earphone chord is too short and the earphones itself fits too tightly in my ears. Other than that, it's a good little machine."
2,Mediocre at best,"This is not a bad digital audio player, but it is not a very good one. The main problems with this player is a seemingly short battery life. Once the battery gets to a low point, but not completely drained, the player can be turned on, but the song lists cannot be browsed, and sometimes it can't even be changed to the next song unless paused, but it will still play."
1,STAY AWAY!!! CHEAP GARBAGE!!!,"Within the first 10 minutes of use, the play/pause button became stuck in the ""in"" position, so I had to return it. A huge design defect. Also, the user interface is totally non-intuitive & unwieldy, and is even difficult to use AFTER reading the manual. I bought a jetAudio iAudio U2 1GB player instead and it's awesome."
3,Too small,"Sound is great but if you need glasses, you will sure need them for this unit. The display is tiny and a bit confusing. Still haven't been able to teach my wife how to use it, but it's our first one. Earbuds are a tad large for me, but then it's not for me."
3,3 months,"this product worked for 3 months, but after 3 months you lose the music on the left side of the earphone. (its the mp3 not the earphone). i dont know about other people, but i'm dissapointed since this MP3 player was working so well."
3,SanDisk 1 GB MP3 Player Silver,It's a nice little mps player. Only flaws is that it goes through batteries like water and the sound quality is average.
3,Software kind of etchy,"I just bought my Sandisk 2 days ago, and i had to exchange it once already. The software kept freezing up on me, if I tried to skip songs, it would skip a couple and then the system froze. I took out the battery and it would be all ok, but then soon enough it will freeze again! This is a HUGE bug on any mp3 player, you shouldnt have to live with it! (I really like my music playing non-stop, I hope everyone else does!) Another problem was that it wouldnt fill up the entire memory. I constantly had 173mb left and couldnt store anymore!I knew this mp3 had a few bugs before purchasing it but I gave it the benefit of the doubt! I returned the first unit the next day and now the new one is running very smoothly. i can fill up the 1gb and I can skip as many songs as I want without freezing!Storage is great! left handers be happy, you can switch between left and right handed displays. decent player!"
3,1 Gigabyte?,"The device plays music well, there is nothing wrong with that part. It is advertised as a 1 gigabyte hard drive. As I download files, it will only fill to about 550mb. After that it says that nothing else will fit."
3,Cheap and functional... not durable,"This is a very good MP3 player for the price. You can see the other reviews for a list of all the good features it has. My only complaint is that the materials are very cheap and therefore it's very easy to break it. Mine stopped working after I dropped it on a carpeted floor. So keep that in mind if you intend to buy it. Also, the stick controller doesn't seem to last too long either. Hope my 2 cents have been helpful."
1,Buyers remorse and losing hair,"After two weeks of failed attempts at downloading music to this player and reformating and lost files I think my hair is starting to actually fall out of it's own accord.The most music i've been able to keep on this player has been 22 songs. When attempting a large download ""sync"" no matter what I do, whether it be aquiring licenses beforehand, removing files that need conversion, and what not, I still end up either with no files, or at most 8. In the root directory I can find a listing of the artists and album names from the music i've attempted to download, but the music files themselves are nowhere to be found.I would highly recommend saving your sanity and coughing up a few extra dollars for a higher quality piece of audio equipment."
1,Buy an Ipod,I bought this and it worked for a week. Very poor quality. Pay the extra and get an Ipod Nano. It's much better for the few extra $.
3,Difficult to manuver,"I found that it is difficult to manuver the folders and supfolders. I do like the capability of holding 1 GB of space. I do like it for books on tape. But, again, the getting to the correct folder than subfolder is awful. I am going to do more research on other MP3 players and see what I can fine. The price was great but you get what you pay for."
4,Great player for a great value,This little player is awesome!!! I was looking for an MP3 player for some time and didn't want to join the Ipod cult. I have friends that have Ipod minis but I didn't want to shell out that much money. I also didn't need that much space 1GB is more than enough for me. It is so easy to put music on and off the player! Also it was importaint for me to be able to replace the battery with little effort. I've had this player for 2 months and I'm still on the original battery! I love that I can attach a cord to it so it can hang around my neck.
4,Best value flash player for the money,"This is a great player for the price, lots of configuration (ala iriver), USB2 mass HD compliant, AAA batteries, great (not excellent) sound, uses DOS directories for files, FM, VBR support (tries 220Kbs and works).Use Windows MP to create auto playlists of 1gb random songs from your library, does what itunes autofill function does.CONS: A bit slow in going into next song, esp with shuffle, sometimes takes max of 4 seconds. Battery seems to last only around 8-10 hours, but im still testing. No lanyard included. No FM recording. Minor stuff for an otherwise great player."
4,SanDisk 1mb digital audio player,"I have been using it for two months and for the money it is a good product. I ride the bus for about 40 minutes each way in the morning and it's to nice escape from the rattle and roar of traffic. AAA Battery lasts more than a week, but I recharge over the weekend so I'm not sure how long it would last. I got about 19 CD albums on it.Two gripes:The joystick is itty-bitty and you have to have thumbnail to work it.The instruction book doesn't cover all of the capabilities of the machine. I accidently found that I could adjust the volume from left to right, alter the treble/bass, cause it to shuffle and several other items the instructions didn't mention."
3,Only had it for 12 hours,"Bought mine on Amazon. Recd and began to use the unit on the first evening. The software that shipped with it did an automatic flash upgrade when I connected it to my PC. I don't know if that is related but when I finally got to working the file/folder navigation I discovered the fonts/items were not visible. Called Tech Support and went through various evolutions (re-formatting, etc) to try and fix it. Ended up RMA the morning after I received it. May just be a bad unit so now I must wait for a new one. I'll give SanDisk the benefit of the doubt here but I am a bit bothered at paying $140USD and waiting 2 weeks to use my device.If the next unit they ship works; then all is fine. I like it's size and capacity as portability and durability are my ultimate concerns. If not they get it back and I don't by from SanDisk again. We'll see."
4,Easy to use,This player is very easy to use. The directions are pretty clear. The only thing I wish it did was do random play. It holds lots of music and great for use at the gym. I'm very pleased with its performance so far.
3,An aging classic.,"It used to be my personal favorites, but it's inability to play videos and the lack of an internal battery are making it look more like an alternative for small children. They should release a new version with integrated USB, eliminating the need for the cable."
4,Cello mold,"Both necro and expansive, this one-man project, a cross between LEVIATHAN and Nord-era SETHERIAL, writes long, mutating passages with a very cosmic feel. Unlike other ""cosmic"" black metal bands, Azrael doesn't resort to futuristic soundscapes or industrial whirring - he does it all with an instrument I've never heard in black metal: a cello. Man, this album makes the cello sound evil - a nasty groan, muttering below cycling, buzzy riffage and unintelligible shrieks. Interesting note on those shrieks, too - this is a black metal artist who not only treats his vocals as another instrument, but he hasn't even written any lyrics for these tales - apparently, they're just syllables. Production is better than expected for this necro type of sound - it's more like the haunting sound heard on early OPETH discs, at once thin and bassy. A terrific find. 4.25/5"
4,SO HORRIBLE IT TRANSCENDS ITSELF!,"I enjoy a horribly bad movie. I enjoy a wonderfully crafted movie. What I don't enjoy is a mediocre movie. I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. Guess which one of my catagories this movie falls into. I'll give you a hint: Kitty Carlisle wearing pasties.(I KNOW,LOL) If you enjoy the types of movies I do,and I don't think you would be reading this if you didn't,this movie has to be seen to be believed. ENJOY!"
2,Accidentlly picked the wrong DVD,"I accidentally chose this DVD over the classic. This is a video book, literally someone reading the book to you while the video pages are being turned. Don't buy this unless you want to use it for educational purposes."
2,Okay.....,"This book was alright, but it was kind of boring....I expected alot more after reading Lily's Crossing, which I really liked alot. It was one of those books that you count how many pages you have left till it's over....."
3,Okay for Spence fans,"Typical Jonanthan Spence fare, if that's your pleasure. If you're a fan of his (and I happen to think he's very good) or you're interested in the broader perspectives of Chinese-Western culture exchanges over the centuries, then you'll enjoy it. Otherwise you'll probably find it either abstruse or boring. Suit yourself."
4,Satisfied with this TV and Amazon's service,"I bought this TV on 22nd March and shipment reached to me on 28th. This is my first big TV and I did plenty of research before buying this TV. I had 21"" Panasonic CRT. I compared Sony, Sharp and Samsung. Price and quality wise this TV is better than Sharp and next to Sony. HD quality is stunning at any distance and SD quality is better if you watch at 7-10 feet of distance. Overall no complains neither with TV nor with Amazon's service."
2,Good when it works.,"Purchased this item from Amazon and it arrived in a hurry. Worked for one day then failed. Half the screen was good the other half was green. Called Samsung. They sent a repairman. Set not fixable. Took seven weeks and numerous calls to get it replaced. Finally get a call that they will ship. Carrier says it will arrive at 7:00 am. Too early? Too bad! You want it, that's when we are coming. You don't, you can wait for another appointment. Called Samsung, cuz now I startin' to get pissed off. Customer service geek tells me: "" Hey, we're a multi-national company. Get a life."" Just another company with no commitment to customer service. Their attitude is we got your two grand and you can wait."
1,Stay away from Samsung,"I recently bought this TV and within 4 days needed to get the main board replaced. Since then, the picture has messed up 3 additional times for no reason, and the only way i fix it is by unplugging every cable or letting it power down for at least an hour or over night. This is not the way a tv should be it shouldnt be this much work."
5,An excellent TV,"After doing a lot of research, I finally decided to buy this TV. It is $3100 in Best Buy but a salesman reduced the price for me by $300.As far as the performance is concerned, it is simply superb.I also connect it to my DVD player and laptop. Again the picture is great. I love this TV."
3,EXELENTE,"Compre el televisor hace unos tres mesesdesde que llego quede impresionado por la nueva linealo conecte y comense a disfrutar.creo que la calidad del disfrute tendra mucho que ver con la calidad de imagen que emita la transmicion de cada pais, pero si ud tiene direc-tv con alta deficion ni se preocupe y si a eso le suma un xbox 360 disfrutara de los graficos de una manera espectacular,.en mi caso en Venezuela el directv no es HD, pero adquiri un receiver yamaha RX-V2700 y el trabajo que este hace de convertidor a 1080p en alta resolucion es imprecionante, asi se crea una combinacion perfecta de sonido para el teatro en casa.mi combinacionel tv samsung LN-S4095DRECEIVER YAMAHA RX-V2700Y PARLANTES B&W; ( inglesas y con las que cuentan los estudios Abbey Road de Londres ).NO LO DUDE EN PANTALLAS DE LCD Sansung es su mejor opcion y este televisor lo adorara ya que es una de los poco televisores de 40 pulgadas en el mercado con tan alta dificion en LCD.WILLIAM DUGARTE"
5,"weak speakers, still bonkers","first off you should have a decent receiver for a tv like this, so the weak speakers should never be an issue, this tv is top notch, video games are down right breath-taking, I have not found a control for turing ""volume output"" down so that I can use tv remote for volume control, unfortunately, I need both remotes, my receiver must be old,"
3,"Great TV , but ....",Issues:1) Better picture quality from component vidoe input than from HDMI input with the same COX cable HD signals.2) PIP feature is useless due to no SWAP function on the remote.3) Built in speaker sound quality doesn't match with other brands. No problem if connecting with an AV receiver.
4,Qualitative differance.,"I spent 3 months researching HD t.v.s. I knew I wanted one it was just a matter of brand and price. I considered the Vizio and other less expensive brands, but in the end decided that the Samsung was worth the extra couple of hundred dollars for the features and reliability. The only issue that was dissapointing was the delivery. I was told that the set would be brought into the house. It was a UPS delivery and was dropped off at the front door. If I wasn't home it would have just sat out front. Not what I wanted when spending $1700. I was glad tht I went and got the top end 1080. The picture is great."
5,All I can say is Wow,This is the best quality picture of any LCD TV for the price. I'm sure there are better pictures out there but for the price no others can even come close to this. Very pleased with this set.
5,Great TV and Superb Picture Quality..,I just bought this TV before a month. No problem so far with picture quality just it needs some improvement in built-in HD receiver. Wait for a good price between 1399-1550. I got mine at 1499.98 and I hope it stops working within a year as SAMSUNG has a new line of LCD's out called as T-series which are more better than this and Samsung will replace this one to T's as per one-year Manufacturer Warranty.
4,pretty much lives up to my expectations so far,"I had researched HD options for a while and settled on the 40"" 4095 as having the bells and whistles I wanted and no more. After about a month of use it is performing OK. The unit arrived in a box that was poorly enough sealed and beat-up that I wondered if I would be returning it for damage, but it does not so far appear to have suffered so. Picture is great with HD broadcasts, but I have yet to hook up a DVD player. Am also still using only the built-in speakers, and as expected they are lacking not only in depth but in volume ability at times. That however was not a surprise. One month of use does not define an adequate test drive however; I will see how it is still performing 6 months from now"
4,A good set.,"This is a very nice set. What bothered me is the shiny black finish on the flat bezel (surounding plastic frame) reflects a lot of light into the viewer's eye. You get used to it after a while but if had I the option to choose a set with a matte finish or a curved bezel, I would go that route. I had the option to see a similar set in a store but the store always has a darkened area for display and unusual viewing angles.On a couple of occasions I have had some strange behavior of the set. I had to ""reboot"" the thing by unplugging it once. Another time I had to turn it off and back on when commands from the remote did not present the correct response.The other issue is a weakness in zoom features, very particular remote control reception (you have to point accurately), and a wierdly arranged remote (button positions aren't the most ergonomic)."
4,Pretty Good,"The TV came set up for HD thus the regular picture was not good. After adjusting the settings the regular picture was much better, but not as good as hoped. Everything else is great.The delivery was awful. It was shipped UPS and although the box had my correct address it was delivered to a furniture store across town. It took 5 phone calls with 3 broken promises and 2 full days spent at home awaiting delivery (because UPS had originally telephoned to say that someone whould have to be home to sign for it)to get UPS to pick it up and deliver it properly. Of course UPS didn't apologize or any thing else. In fact the supervisor would not even talk to me. Nobody was concerned that I lost two work days waiting and paid $100 for the delivery. Amazon did offer a $20 discount on future purchases, but the original shipper ""Electronics Expo"" never bothered to answer my email."
4,Great TV for the price,"I bought this TV because it fell into my price range, but it is packed with all of the features available at the moment. I just got my HD cable hooked up this past week, and the picture is amazing, even though it's only in 1080I.The down side that I did find is that in order for the picture in picture to work, you have to have two sources of cable running into the TV. For example, I had my cable running into the TV through my VCR. For the PIP to work, I had to hook a second set of cables from my VCR to the TV through one of the component inputs, and had to watch TV through my VCR. I don't know if every PIP is the same as this, this is my first one, but I had figured that the processer itself would be able to split the signal, not needing two seperate inputs.The shiny frame around the screen shows fingrprints, and smudges really easy, and is prone to scratches.All in all, I am very pleased with this TV, and would buy another one."
5,Samsung's the best!,"We selected this unit because it has 1080p. We are very happy with the product and are especially pleased with its clear, sharp picture. The 40"" size fits our space quite nicely."
5,Awesome HD picture quality,Great color and contrast seem to jump out at you. Sound quality isn't that bad as some have reported. I will get the Bose system anyway.
4,Very Happy,"I have been using this TV for just about a month now and really enjoy it. Shipping took about 10 days with no problems. The tracking info is not always correct so don't get too worried. I was called on a Friday to have delivery scheduled for the following Tuesday (Between 1-5PM). The delivery driver called about 15 minutes before arriving to make sure I could still be there. Like others, the reason for the 4 stars is due to sound quality. However, 90% of the time I use different speakers so it is not an issue. I would also recommend adjusting the energy savings level as soon as you get the TV. I put mine on low (standard is High) and it makes a huge difference for brightness. The price dropped about $70 after I bought it but Amazon credited me the difference when I e-mailed them. I don't have cable, but am using standard rabbit ears to get a great digital signal. The Masters looked unbelievable in HD. I recommend Amazon to anyone looking to buy a TV based on my experience."
2,Does not fit a 2006 Yukon XL or Suburban,"Caution, this will not fit all of the applications listed. There is a cross member on the 2006 Yukon XL and Suburban that intefears with this deeper pan. Construction and price on this item are both very good."
4,"Good, easy read","Although this book won't be a great modern classic, the writing and characters are interesting enough to make for a great read. The time frame for the book (the Iranian hostage crisis) provides a neat structural device for the story and Langer weaves all of the individuals' stories together deftly. It's not a book of grandiose scenes but of quiet, life changing moments and they're beautifully rendered."
2,I don't get it!,"I had read that this book was supposed to be the ""best summer fiction book of 2004"". I was eagerly awaiting this highly touted book. What a disappointment! I tried at least three times to begin the book, hoping that i was missing something and hadn't given it enough attention...not the case...i just couldn't connect with the characters, or their self absorbed lives. I gave up. Definitely cannot recommend this one."
2,Brilliant???,"This is just a terrible book...nothing good to say about any of the characters with the possible exception of Muley. This book is depressing and shallow. Or, if you take it seriously, it is still depressing with a low opinion of life and the future. I realize this is not the prevailing opinion, but someone needs to say it. Sorry, L.C. Powell"
2,Another disappointing read,"This is a boring book. The characters are so cliched and the writing is annoying. It has a shoved down your throat style that never finds relief; nothing lightens and nothing is redeemable here; and it's too thick with Jewish ethnicity. Not to say there is anything wrong with that, it's just that here, it comes off as too much of an ""inside club"". I mean, I felt like I had to borrow a yarmulke to continue reading. (maybe that would have helped, though)This book did nothing for me; I didn't mind the cultural aspects, the political climate of the times; but all in all, the story virtually goes nowhere. The characters come off as flat & two dimensional, and the doing away with punctuation in the dialogue was bothersome. Obviously, the author has friends at the publisher he's with. His writing is so predictable and he has nothing new or refreshing to say like so many writers out there.For my time and money, give me David Sedaris, or George Carlin's latest."
4,thoroughly enjoyable romp through the late 70s,"Having grown up not far from west rogers park, I thoroughly enjoyed Adam Langer's mash note of a book to the people and places of his late 70s youth. The depictions of the area and the cultures of the families depiceted in the book rang true. I didn't really want it to end. It was that enjoyable."
3,Fine writing - just did not connect with me,I liked this book. I didn't love it and am not enthralled with it. I recommend this to those who enjoy the peeling of the onion to get to the core of multi-family relationships. The writing is excellent. I just couldn't get it on with the various stories.
1,Needs more,"As a native Chicago suburbanite, I believe this book does portray the late-70s there quite well. As an avid and experienced reader, by about page 390 it dawned on me that the book had become shallow and even quite vulgar. The author's fixation with tawdry areas of teenage lives became quite taxing, and even boring through repetition. I so enjoyed going back in time and place to my hometown area through fiction, but ultimately was disappointed by a pretty meaningless read."
2,Tedious,"I liked a few things about this book...the humor, the cultural references to the 70's...but I kept waiting for the story to take off...and it didn't. The characters are stereotypes, which may be the author's intention, but I found them uninteresting. Although I'd consider this ""light reading"" because of the subject matter and immature writing, I wouldn't recommend it as such because it was way too long and boring."
2,Spotty,"Flashes of interesting situations and characters, but overall flabby and poorly put together. At the end it just trails off, instead of being brought to a conclusion."
3,flavorful but not entirely satisfying,"As a recent arrival to Chicago, I was hoping for an insightful, cultural portrait of a slice of the Windy City. It delivered on a number of fronts, namely an insiders view of a predominantly Jewish neighborhood and a cast of diverse and quirky characters. However Langer did not paint his female characters with enough finesse and tiptoed into cliches a little too frequently for my taste."
4,Loved it!,"I enjoyed it immensely, the author does a fantastic job switching voices. He captures the essence of the time period completely. I looked at this book several times before finally picking it up and and was glad I finally did."
5,Easy to install,"This was a DIY project that I had no clue what I was doing, but went well. I used 2 of these to add exhaust vents to the kitchen and the bathroom and it went well. The damper is very well made and the vent tubing is heavy gauge! A suggestion however, use a hose clamp instead of the provided zip ties, they slip off too easy and are too ard to get super tight without breaking them."
2,wrong book sent,"she sent me the wrong edition of the book, either because she advertised it as the wrong edition, or there was a mistake on your all's website about which book it was under items available for sale. your website has been most unhelpful in getting our situation straightened out and we have had to take matters into our own hands and return the books/send checks for ourselves."
4,great deal,"item arrived when promised,I bought it brand new and paid much less then i would have anywhere else.100% satisfied."
1,Threw it away after first use,"This poacher is much more flimsy than it appears in the photo. And it isn't non-stick At. All.The bottoms of the eggs stuck to the poacher and the ""non-stick"" coating came off with the eggs. It wasn't so much teflon as it was black paint or nail polish.And the tops of the eggs were completely liquid. Don't waste your money."
3,too small,too small compartments..eggs run over and outwhat more can i say? i guess i need a few more words....nope done
4,"Good, fast computer for the price","I purchased this computer soon after it came out, and got lucky on getting a floor model at an excellent price. Except for having a weak on-board video card (which I soon upgraded) it is powerful and reliable. The only reasons I'm not giving it 5 stars is the fairly lacking onboard video card, and the ""personal media drive"" bay. I really would have preferred more space for another hard drive instead of this thing. Also, I did not like that it didn't have many upgrade slots available. Other than those fairly minor drawbacks I really have enjoyed this machine, and with the new video card it plays my games flawlessly."
3,"Ok,but...","For $16 a can and free shipping, its not a bad deal. But the only problem is that a full serving is 4 nice size scoops. A can of protein at GNC is about $30-$40 per can and you only need about 1 scoop for a full serving. But with 4 scoops, you get more protein and amino acids with the sportpharma. I would say 3 scoops of this equals about 1 scoop of GNC protein products. Not a bad buy if you want a deal. They also taste really good."
4,good stuff for the price,This is the least expensive protein and carb combo and it tastes great. I use a shaker cup and it doesn't mix perfectly but other than that I recommend it for a good post workout shake.
1,Manage Without It,"Save yourself some time and money by NOT purchasing this book. While some of the info is interesting and very well written, this treatment lacks the depth of field to live up to the title of an Administrator's Handbook. It's more suited for use in getting your CFO to seriously consider purchasing the product. It's lack of detail and overview presentation style is just the thing for preparing those executive budget request for new technology.You're much better off getting the ManageWise Doc off the ManageWise CD, but be prepared - it's in PDF format."
1,"Is this it? No detail, barely worth it!","This is an extremely poor effort considering that it is the only book I can find on the subject. Definately geared at Novices, it will not answer any of the questions you may about the product. In fact, this book should just be included in the MW package, it so bare bones."
2,Needs more detail and also cover more of the software.,This is only a bare bones book on the basics of ManageWise. There is so much more that the auther could have covered. Also needs more detail on the topics that it did cover.
1,Where is the rest of the book?,This does not go into enough detail. You can get more information from Novell's website.
2,American at Dien Bien Phu?,"The stories in this book claim to be all true, but I have to wonder. Jack Waer's story of his role in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu caught my eye. He claims to have spent 6 months at Beatrice (the strongpoint that was the northeast corner of the French defenses at Dien Bien Phu). This would have been kind of difficult, since Beatrice did not exist for even four months. It was established in December 1953, and was overrun by the Viet Minh on March 14, 1954."
5,Insightful,"Classic work on the evolution of the self that considers Piaget, Erikson, Kolhberg etc. Very easy to read - and extremely helpful in understanding our differences and self-development."
2,Baffled me,"It seems not to be the book for an average reader. Although I think the author is probably presenting some valuable ideas, I could not read this book. This excerpt is one example why:It is exactly because the newly ""thrown over"" culture of embeddedness is as much the old me as the not-me that it must remain in place for the child herself to gradually redefine her relationship to it.I think I know what the author means by this. It took me about ten readings to get to that point. That is just one sentence."
1,Flawless design.... but flawed HR monitor,"I tried this product after having great success with Timex products in the past. After getting the watch and quickly learning the functions I was very excited. The HR monitor function worked great for a couple of weeks, however, after a short time it took the watch increasing amounts of time to find and display my Heart rate. After one recent work out, the watch did not find the signal from the monitor until my work out was over - it beeped to tell me I was below my target heart rate. I mean at least that function worked...right? OK, long story short - I had to replace the batteries in the monitor itself twice within a period of 2 weeks. I think I might have just gotten a dud, but I am not willing to try the product again. In my frustration I returned the item. Not recommended"
2,Satisfied Customer,"The watch is easy to use and navigate. I use all settings except the programmable workout, I prefer to use the review function and look at the heart rate for each segment for which I hit the split/lap button which is a fantastic feature. The only difficulty I ran into was using the heart rate monitor in the cold. Without a good sweat and contact between your chest and the monitor, such as can happen when running in the cold (below 20*F in my experience) the monitor is unable to pick up heart rate accurately. However, I would fully expect this same thing to occur with any monitor. I have run into the odd problem of the watch spontaneously reverting to factory presets. Not only is this annoying but it makes for an unreliable alarm which I used my previous watch for."
2,No replacement strap available,Good watch.Could not find a replacement strap when it broke. Had to retire the watch and look for another one.
3,Crummy band makes it almost worthless,"I love the watch, but the band is terrible - I've had this watch for 2 1/2 years and I must have gone through four bands in that time. Maybe that's not so bad if it was just a $5 replacement band and a few minutes each time, but it's compounded by the fact that the replacement band is VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE to install - I took mine to three watch shops and each of them gave up on it. Finally I had to have my friend take it to an Official Timex Repair Faciltiy, and they were able to do it (forget about trying to install the replacement band on your own.)"
4,IronMan Watch review,This watch is great. It has better buttons and controls than my previous IronMan model. The watch is very easy to use and the HeartRate Monitor is very easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested.
1,"great functions, low quality","The funtionality is really great. It is very easy to use and the sensor is quick reading; However, the batery last ony 20 hours, not the 800 like informed in the manual. I sent to the timex in my country, tehy tested and did't find any problem, but even so sent me another. What ahppened? 20 hours after the batery was dead. So, obviously it was built wiht low quality standards, because excessive energy consume is the mark of of low quality eletronics. Try another. I live in Brazil, so I need pay US300 for this trash! Yes, US300!"
1,Heart Rate Readings all over the map...,"I had pretty high expectations for the Timex to replace my existing HRM since I'd had one of the first Timex HRM's a while ago and was very pleased with it. However, after reading up in the training manual and strapping it on for my first workout, I noticed strange behavior; it read my resting heart rate spot on, but after starting my workout, it kept reading significantly low rates for the first half hour of the workout. It was like it kept ""creeping up"" on my heart rate. 15 minutes into the exercise, I should have been low 120's and it was still in the 80's and climbing. Towards the end of the workout it finally peaked over 160, and stayed there, when it should have been 130's to 140's. Strange! I thought maybe it was calibrating itself, but it did the same thing the next time out. Definitely a problem with it. I turned it back in, and decided to get a Suunto T4C HRM...much nicer IMHO."
1,Dissappointing,This was a very disappointing purchase. First one I received read way too high on my first run (30-40 bpm above normal). I called Timex and they sent out a replacement chest strap which they said they would test before sending. This read way too low. I sent both back to Amazon and received a replacement the next day. It also read way too low. Gave up and sent it back for a refund. I've had Timexes before and they worked well. This model just doesn't seem to have the same reliability.
4,"Good Watch, Good Price","Ok, I have been looking at these for a while and I have to say for the money this thing is probably one of the best options.In terms of functionality you'll get more bells & whistles then you will probably need. Most important to me is the Chronograph and it's lap fucntions & the different zone settings you can create in HRM mode.I'm sure that other watches allow you to download your data, but I like to use a simple excel program & create my own runner's log so I didn't need the download option.Pros: Easy to use, good functions, chest monitor is comfortable.Cons: The only thing I can think of is that the start/stop button on timer is located at bottom right & sometimes I hit it by accident & it scews up my times.Also, I can't say about the battery life yet, but I know that you can get replacements easy as they are typical 3V Lithium at least for the monitor.I've owned this watch for a couple months now & I would recommend it to anyone, not just runners."
3,Good HRM; lousy wristband,"I've owned two of this model, wearing them almost daily for work and to train for marathons and shorter races. Each time, I've been very happy with the accuracy of the HRM and ease-of-use of the watch. My only complaint is that in both instances the plastic wristband has broken in 18 months or less. Unlike other Timexes I've owned, it's evidently not possible to replace the band without buying a whole new watch. If you're comfortable with a ""leased"" or ""rental"" watch that you'll be able to use for just about 1-1/2 years, this is a good choice. If having to replace the watch frequently would frustrate you, look elsewhere. For me, these have been five star watches on one star wristbands."
5,Great Watch,"Great Watch. I use it every day. Nice enough to wear every day to work and great for the gym. Chest strap is comfortable and I have had no problems with it. Watch is easy to use, and easy to view. Monitor seems accurate when compared to HRM's on equipment at the gym they show the same rate."
3,Too simple,"This dictionary is not for someone who is interested in learning Cherokee past a simple superficial level. The dictionary lacks many basic vocabulary words important to the region, such as ""American"". It has translations of ""French people"" or ""German"" but does not have a simple word like ""American"" or a complete list of the United States of America. However, this dictionary seems to be the only dictionary of its kind with a wide range of vocabulary translated from English to Cherokee. Beginners will enjoy this book and the advanced will have to settle for this until a better dictionary is published."
4,Easy to use,"This is an easy to use English to Cherokee Dictionary. It is useful for basic vocabulary and the beginning student. It is not comprehensive, nor does it provide Cherokee to English. It also does not have grammatical helps. However, for someone just learning Cherokee for the first time it can be a useful tool."
4,Better than nothing,"Actually my android app does as much as this book does, however there is nothing like the feel of paper when reading a book."
5,"A user friendly, single volume guide to enhancing a website","Cailin Boyle's Color Harmony For The Web is a completely ""user friendly"", single volume guide to enhancing a website through effective color selections. This handy reference covers hundreds of color combinations organized by style and mood, providing the reader with inspiration and expertise in making their web color selections perfectly showcase their purposes and intentions. Enthusiastically recommended for novice and experienced webmasters alike, Color Harmony For The Web provides more than 800 unique color schemes (including RGB and Hex codes); color palettes matched to specific moods; inspiring and illustrative examples of real-life website color schemes; and a color conversion chart for easy and accurate color matching."
2,MORON ALLERT!!! (1st Edition),"This review reffers to the 1st edition of ""Color Harmony For The Web"". Several of the colors reffered to in the back are so completely wrong that even the prooven excuse ""Color appears differently in print than on the screen"" doesn't do it anymore.How would you for example explain why a color printed in green turnsout to be blue?So, when purchasing this book, make sure you obtain the 2nd edition which - so claims the publisher - has the correct colors.Otherwise, this book is quite helpful since it shows you some interesting color combinations you can use in your web projects."
1,This one needs a minus rating!!,"The author published corrections on the web site, but they are too numerous to make the book worthwhile. As you flip through the pages and think you've found a color combination, you then have to compare it against the error list... what a pain - the errors have made the book worthless for what the stated intent was. If you simply want to be able to look at three colors next to each other to see what you might like, it does that. Try then to use the RGB scale for the corresponding numbers, and that's when the 'fun' begins of uncovering error after error!!"
1,Dissapointing!,"Can you imagine? This is a book about colors of the web and it has mistakes about it! The book shows green while the correct color should be pink, etc. Yes, there's a page whose the correction... but do I have to see the revised page every time I want to mix colors???? What a wasting time! :("
3,Falls down on color,"I was initially highly delighted with the book. An equal to any of the other books in the 'Color Harmony' range. Then I began to spot errors with the colors. Glaring errors. Where greens should have been blue, reds should have been purple and so on. Until Rockport Publishers reprints this book with the correct colors, the whole book becomes mislending, especially to novices in the field of web color."
2,color disharmony,"The color schemes in the book are great, but, this is a big but: the RGB codes/hex codes are NOT correct. so this book is totally useless!A webdesigner from the Netherlands"
2,Color Shemes - AND WRONG COLOR CHARTS...,"A catalog of different color shemes to be used on web sites, with little explanation on how these came to be. Some of the colors in the first edition have been printed incorrect, although the 2nd edition is supposed to have the correct colors printed."
1,Do not buy this book...,"The book is fantastic, in fact I got it at Borders recently but discovered it was the first printing with all the wrong colors. I returned it, then came to Amazon figuring they would have the latest edition. They don't. I ordered it here and just got it today, it is the first edition with the little supplement color correction sheet. It is too cumbersome to cross reference the colors and if I am paying for a book, I should not be expected to do that. So, very disappointed. Great book...but Amazon should have the newer version that is supposedly out there I feel."
1,Useless,"The temperature is consistently wrong. I don't know how you can make a thermostat that does that, but whoever made this managed to pull it off."
5,The Best Pool Thermometer,"We bought a second one of these, after using the first at our pool in Florida. It's a very nice product with very clear, easy-to-read, temperature markings and a handy sticky pad for attaching to the side of the pool."
1,So inaccurate as to be useless,"The scale on the thermometer is easy to read, as advertised. Unfortunately, it is therefore very easy to see that the thermometer's temperature reading is off by 5 degrees (F). That is not acceptable."
1,Fell apart,"My old pool thermometer fell apart and so I'm shopping for a new one. Found out this is the one I last bought and realized it only lasted a year, and not even that. As others have noted, the mercury tube becomes dislodged and slides around in the flimsy twisted-wire mounts, making it useless for actually determining temperature since the gradations are on the unit itself and not on the mercury tube.Waste of money. Avoid."
3,Faulty Kindle Edition!!!,"This review relates to the Kindle edition specifically. The book itself I might have rated a four, but the Kindle edition had MANY typographical errors throughout the last half as well as what seems to be pages of missing text in the digital version. I was able to power through and decipher the errors (""ufe""=life for expample)because I was interested in what was going to happen. I still enjoyed the book mostly, but the missing text and all the errors made reading this edition not nearly as enjoyable as it could have been."
5,How come I got it to work?,"By the way, this cd has some great live tracks, but for some reason, I was able to copy this cd! Like the other reviewer said, it IS copy protected, but I got it to copy somehow!this cd is totally worth the dollar it costs!"
3,Works good but Eats up the battery,I had this product for around few months now. It works well but eats up the battery. My T39 used to require no charging for 3 days normally and after using the jabra i had to now recharge daily.. Not worth it over the weekdays..
3,"Handy, but not completely reliable","I love not being attached to my phone by a cord and though the audio is better than I thought it would be from an accessory that came free with the phone (Sony Ericsson T610) it's still got a few bugs. It's a little bulky, but still comfortable to wear on long conversations. All being equal, it's a great improvement on what's out there now, but I'm looking forward to future upgrades."
2,"It's [inexpensive], but that's what you pay for!","I have been using this earpiece for almost a week. I think I'll reture it since it's not matching what they said on the spec sheet. There is no 100 hrs of standby time, the unit only has less than 50 hrs standby time. There is no 4 hrs of talk time, talk time only lasts for 1 hr. I think there're better ear piece out there with better battery. The good thing about this earpiece is it's light and comfortable."
2,"Tempermental, but good when working.","I've owned this headset for a good 8 months now. It is comfortable, neat looking and when it works there's nothing better.It may be my area or my phone (T610), but it seems that almost everywhere I go the connection leaves something to be desired. It only works real well when my phone has perfect signal - if not I have to use the phone like regular as speaking w/ the headset cuts out every other word.That said I've head real good things about Logitech's Bluetooth rendition on this. Check out their webpage: www.logitech.com"
1,NOT for Nokia 3650,"I just received my Freespeak today (August12) and it DOES NOT WORK with a Nokia 3650, contrary to label on this item.It sure looks cool, though.Dan"
2,Cool gadget but desperatly needs redesign,First one I received had a defective answer key. Sent it back for a replacement. The replacement unit looked really cool and function well in an ideal situation. However it was way to sensitive to interferance and the range claims didn't hold up to my exerience. It frequently got choppy when more than 2-3 feet from the phone. I'm using Ericsson T68m. I replaced it with the Plantronics M1000 which so far seems to function better.
3,Used with a Nokia 6310i - with mixed results,"The Jabra FreeSpeak connected with my Nokia 6310i fine, but it would disconnect for no reason. The headset was never farther then my ear to my waist. The clarity was never as good as a wired headset. People complained they could not hear me very well and the static was louder then the conversation most of the time. It could be the phone or I just got a bad one. I have not tried any other Bluetooth headsets. This was the cheapest and I thought I would try it first. I will try another brand when I can get a good deal on one."
3,bluetooth - headset/handsfree and the Nokia 3650,"According to Jabra tech support the issue isn't bugs in the Nokia 3650, it's simply that Nokia decided to use the handsfree Bluetooth profile on that phone instead of the headset Bluetooth profile. All of these headsets made since the 19th week of 2003 support both profiles and are supposed to have the blue sticker about supporting the Nokia 3650.My only real gripe is that Jabra made this major change to the firmware but left the model number, etc., the same, so there's no way to tell what you're getting unless you can examine the box in person."
2,Nice Idea But Far From Market Ready,"I bought this unit a month ago and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to others. The earpiece is difficult to adjust and my fiends on the receiving end don't like the voice quality. The earpiece needs to be recharged often. Before purchasing the Jabra FreeSpeak Bluetooth Headset, I would wait until the design is optimized. In the meantime, I am looking for something better."
4,Jabra for BT Phones worth the $$$,"This is a great piece! It feels lighter on your ear than you'd expect, although it does take a couple of days to get used to its presence on your ear. People I call can hear me clearly, and the reception volume is solid as well. Setup was a cinch with my Sony t616 BT phone. Just followed the useful Jabra quick start guide, turned on BT on my t616, selected connect, and they were in touch. Another reviewer noted that you can use your BT phone up 20-30 ft away which gives you ample range, plus you can leave your cell in a central radius and not carry it around the house. This is true and it's great! It only took 2 hours for a full charge and you can talk for a few hours w/o worrying about recharge. Also, it costs half as much as other wireless headsets.Its size makes it more discreet than other headsets-which I like.Only reason I dont give it 5 stars is that it has slightly less than perfect clarity when listening to someone. Otherwise, this unit is wonderful."
3,Flexible ear bud breaks off,"It is more comfortable and lighter than the SonyEricsson model due to a soft Santoprene plastic material (dark grey). After two months, the tiny eyeglass size screw holding the ear bud extension stripped from the boss inside hard plastic (silver) case. This exposes the two wires leading to the speaker at the tip. Service request via email to Jabra for a warranty (1 year) Repair Authorization Number went unanswered less than two months after owning the FreeSpeak. Very poor customer service Jabra!! Jabra needs to switch to a longer screw or one with more bite!"
1,Misleading Title,"I purchased this headset specifically for use with my Nokia 3650 (as advertised above).However, the unit I received is *not* compatible with the the Nokia 3650. The number near the microphone indicates that this unit does not support the Nokia 3650 (the number should be 19B, not 05B as is on my unit).Jabra will swap the unit (at no additional charge) for one that is compatible - however, you will have to pay delivery charges to Jabra in California."
4,"It's a great headset, but....","I have tried a lot of headsets and this is the most clear (and loud)!!!The reception is perfect and the transmision too, but (there is the bad side) the range is about 2 meters (leaving the phone over the table). I contact Jabra and they said that the version is older and i need to send them the headset (to UK) the ultimate release is the 51A. I use it with the Sony T68i and the configuration is too easy.The comfort is the best i never use. I use it all day long and the cell life is very good (about 2 days) at full use.I recommend the headset... but the latest version!!!"
2,"loud, poor reception, unpredictable.","I used this headset with my Nokia 6310i. The headset occasionally performed well. Maybe 1 out of 4 calls I had no problems. The rest of the time I had problems with it doing one of the following:1. Randomly disconnecting from my phone during a call.2. Constantly disconnecting and reconnecting to my phone while in standby.3. The volume would be extremely loud even on its lowest setting.4. The reception was totally unpredictable and would one moment be fine and the next be inaudible for no apparent reason.The only good thing about this headset how comfortable it was, but it hardly made up for its defects. I talked to both Jabra and Nokia and they both pointed the finger at each other with regards to what the problem was. I ended up returning it and getting the Nokia version. While it was not perfect, I had much more success with it. Too bad it's not nearly as comfortable."
1,Not Compatible with Nokia 3650,"I just received the headset and it is noit compatible with the Nokia 3650. I contacted Jabra, and they tell me that there should be a blue label on the box stating that the headset is ""Now Compatible with the Nokia 3650..."" and the date code on the headset near the microphone should be 19D or higher - the one I received did not have the label on the box, and the date code was 09D!Check out the search engines, I have now found the correct one and it costs less money!"
5,Minority report phone : ),"I bought this headset after seing minority report, on wich film it appears a phone just like that. And its's a fact! Except for sms, today I can say this my phone. First 'cause I can dial the numbers by voice, second 'cause this baby works perfectilly, sometimes beyond the 10 feet range... just try it. Sound is not a problem for me but I only can compare the sound on the headset with the efr sound of my Ericsson t39m cell phone : )"
1,Jabra and my eye glasses,"I purchased the Jabra Free Speak headset a few months ago and at first it was a novelity, but after using the device with my eye glasses on it was very uncomfortable and made my eye glasses tilt down so much that I either had to remove the headset or take off my eye glasses. As for the quality, I found too much static when using it and worst of all the battery or talk time was far less than 3 hours. All in all, the concept is great, but for people who wear eye or sun glasses the Jabra needs much improvement."
1,Works with 3650? Don't believe it!!!,"I purchased this item recently to use with my Nokia 3650 (an amazing phone, btw). One would think that when Amazon lists theheadset as being compatable with the 3650, it might actually work.That's not the case at all, I'm afraid.Apparently, you need to have the cute little blue sticker on the outside of the box for it to work. To their credit, Jabra offered to cross-ship the unit, and Amazon is going to send me a pre-paid return label and will refund my purchase price and shipping.All that's nice, but I'm pretty miffed that I have to mess around with all of this."
5,Muy Rapido....,"El envio se realizo de manera correcta, incluso llego antes de tiempo y ademas el producto llego en excelentes condiciones."
5,Loved it!,"It was totally fun! The characters have more depth than your average chick lit, and there were all sorts of fun surprises throughout the book, even if you had an idea they were coming. Lyda creates a totally loveable character, a perfct prince, and a page turning novel that left me with a huge smile on my face. I actually jumped with joy at the last chapter! Awesome find!"
2,Didn't even bother to finish it....,"Going by the other reviews I am obviously in the minority with this one.Maybe I was not the target demographic but in all honesty I made it about half way through the book and then my roommate asked to borrow it when she went on holiday. The fact that I let her borrow it when I was halfway through it shows how little I cared about the characters, the plot or was inspired to find out what had happened to either of them. And I've never bothered to get it back.My roommate who did persevere to the end recommended one and a half stars. I'm giving it two in the hope that the second half that I didn't read is superior to the first.If you're new to Christian chick lit then go for the Spa Girls series by Kristin Billerbeck or the Phoebe Grant series by Laura Jensen Walker."
1,Didn't realize I had to assemble it.,I may be wrong but I didn't remember seeing anything stating I would have to assemble. If you are good with the sodering iron then it's a good deal. If you are like me then you threw your money away...
4,Wow!,"""Hero at Large"" was a great addition to ""A Year of Loving Dangerously."" Ms. Amos really captivated the compassion that the main characters had for each other. The only drawback was that she didn't really establish more information on the mysterious ""Simon"" aspect of the story. The dealings happened close to the end. In the others it was introduced sooner. It was still a good read and will be added to my keeper self, but I was kind of disappointed with Rennie's mistrust of Gray. She was a little weak, but I could really see the love that they had for each other. The ending was a nice touch too."
4,The voice of British Prog !,"I have long been a fan of John. From Family, through Crimson and of course UK and till today with the regrouped ASIA, I have seen him in concert many times.This is an album of his other stuff, not much like the bands I have mentioned, but just as meaningful, powerful and as with all of Mr. Wetton's material, HEARTFELT.I can listen to this in its entirety over and over again.A fine collection from an extreamly talented musician."
4,Cell Phone Case,Bought this case for my new cell phone as it was very inexpensive compared with almost the same product offered by carrier.Fits perfectly and looks good. Would recommend buying unless you prefer real leather
5,pure genuis,"The recording of Der Hirt on this cd is amazing. The combination of Serkin, Wright (the greatist clarinetist of his time) and Valente is a work of true genuis. It is as close to perfect as possible. There is simply no better performance of this work available. The horn work of Bloom is also great. The recordings on this cd is juest the best possible. It is a must have for anyone who likes Schubert."
5,I love it,"I think it's great because it really gets into math and how much you need it. I love Nora, she is so fun she really shows you how to get down into many fun activities like to see how big your foot would be if you were a giant, and how to bake a cake!"
3,For pre-teen girls,"I bought this book for a grand-niece. The reading level depends on the intellectual level of the child, but it is generally for pre-teen girls. It is organized as an activity book for young girls having small parties with their friends, with mathematically related activities. It would probably appeal to some children and not to others."
2,Not Bad,"This book reads like a good undergraduate dissertation. The language is ""pretty"", but lacks real depth. I look forward to future writings when this young poet has matured."
3,"Sounds Good, Hard to Navigate","This is a fantastic little player that serves as an FM radio, MP3 player and memory card. You'd swear the earphones were going to fall out of your ears, but they don't and, when one masters the player and can use different software, the device is a bargain.The weaknesses, though, make things difficult for a novice. The software is dreadful, forcing users to find their own MP3 encoders. I also have not been able to record albums to their own directories and have them play in order -- probably a navigation problem on my part. I would have thought with arrow keys, one could navigate their way UP to the ROOT directory, SELECT a CD directory with songs in it and play those songs in the order in which they were recorded. Ah, but that would have been too intuitive.The bottom line is there are better deals on the market unless you have your own copy of Nero or Easy DVD Creator and can dedicate the time to guessing your way through it. The instruction book certainly won't help!"
3,Remember -- you usually get what you pay for,"This player is all right. It provides the function I wanted it to and I have to keep reminding myself of that when I am frustrated by it. I bought this for the gym. I wanted a small, cheap, and simple mp3 player with FM tuner. It is all of those things.The problem is that it is cheap, and it is simple. Music management on the player is a pain. Using the buttons is a guesssing game at best. Sometimes it seems to work like it should, other times it is recording (voice recorder) when I would like it to be playing. The FM tuner is weak and again difficult to manage.I pride myself on being pretty tech savvy, but this little thing at times is infuriating to say the least.Overall a three. I use it each day and it serves its purpose (my mantra)"
4,SanDisk 256 MB MP3 Player Red is a very good choice,"small, light, portatil, and cheap sandisk is very good option of mp3. Its weakness is the software, that me cost a little in including/understanding, but once learned is manageable."
1,Worked for a month or so....,"This player worked great at first except for the occasional skipping. Now, I have to push the head phone plug in and hold it down for me to be able to hear any music. At first, I thought it might be my headphones but after trying 3 other pair...now I know it's the player. I don't recommend the Sandisk MP3 players to anyone."
3,Are you for real,"I continue to read various reviews regarding MP3 players and many other items on Amazon... I must say the reviews regarding MP3 players do not appear to be written by actual consumers, but rather individuals paid to review a product.The product is simple to use and easy to navigate. The product will meet the needs of a ""new"" consumer to the new world of MP3s. If you don't want to spend the money on an ipod, but want a reasonable player, this is your product...That is my review of this player.I may be wrong. The reviews of other items may be written by well written individuals that are well versed in business writing or they may just be paid to write reviews. The sales pitch is there and the wording is just to close to that on a product package...I hope I am wrong, but I may not going to rely on the information I read in these reviews for future purchases.Thanks"
1,Buyer beware,"I was so excited when I intially received this mp3 player; I just could not wait to use it. The downloading was slightly complexed but caught on to it quickly. Once I plug in my headset however, I soon realized the true meaning of re-furbished. I down loaded about 70 songs and I could never get it to play passed #20. Even if I have it random; it still gets stuck. This thing is a piece of junk. You have to take the battery out to turn it off and when I tried to return this item. The company wanted to charge me basically telling me tough luck. So therefore I do not recommend this especially if you by refurbished. IT SUCKS!"
2,not buying another one,"This was the first mp3 player I've used, so I can't say much about the ease of use. I found it hard to find my spot on my audio books, but maybe they are all like that. I thought it sounded great, but maybe they all do.Problem with it was that after only a few weeks, it started having trouble with the earphone connection. I lost it, and looking for a new one,so I can't say how much worse it would have goten, or how long it would have lasted, but I won't be buying another to find out."
4,THe perfect choice,"If you are looking for something cheap, something small, good looking and good quality mp3 player, this is what you have to buy, It has a lot of functions and the sound is perfect, you can use it as a memory disk too, so i recommend you this product instead of an ipod shuffle"
4,Very surprised,I was really amazed at how good this thing sounded for such a small unit. Extremely easy to use. I was up and running in a matter of a couple of minutes. Computer recognized and installed required drivers when plugging in the USB cable. Unit is quite capable of being loud. Headphones sound really good but they hurt. Way too big. Guess that's the price to pay to get good sound but I will be buying a different pair of ear buds as I need something that will fit inside a motorcycle helmet. Great unit.
4,A great entry into the flash-based MP3 race,"The SanDisk MP3 player is an excellent little device. Connecting it to my laptop was a breeze and, with USB 2.0, provides an extremely quick file transfer. Within minutes, the unit was filled to capacity (approximately 60 songs at 160 bits) and performing exactly as it should. My only complaints revolve around the joystick navigator and the minimalistic three button design that can be frustratingly counter-intuitive at times; I had to consult the PDF manual included on the CD on more than one occasion to learn how to perform mundane tasks like setting up a ""Shuffle"" or deleting files.Despite this, the player provides a plethora of customization options, high quality sound, and a big, bright, back-lit display. Little players like these rarely provide options like a fully adjustable equalizer, but this unit delivers. Overall, this is a very nice player at a GREAT price.Just get some new earbuds and you're all set. I'd recommend Sony..."
2,You get what you pay for,"I only used this thing about 5 times, just sitting at my desk at work. Then, the play/stop button jammed down in it.Since this is the on/off button as well, when you try to turn it on, it just goes right off again.What a shame."
1,Don't Buy - 2 Frozen Units So Far,"After purchasing the device as a Christmas present for my daughter, the unit worked for approximately 20 days. Went through the RMA procedure with SanDisk so that they could ship a replacement unit. Just got the new unit back and it too has failed on first try. New battery in, power on, download one song to unit, goto playback and the unit is frozen on the Welcome screen, can't shut off or anything else. Just like the first unit. A piece of junk - don't waste the $70."
5,Very nice & affordable,"Bought this player to use while I workout/run. Very lightweight and the armband is wide, soft, and comfortable. Haven't used the FM tuner yet. would definitely buy this one again."
3,"Works, but not a great player","I have owned this player for almost a year now. Until now, I have not had many problems with it. It is light and it worked. The most annoying thing about this player is the interface. It is usable but it is not as easy as other mp3 players I have used/owned. You have to use three buttons and the thumb nipple button to control the device. Sometimes, it is very frustrating trying to navigate thru the different modes. Or, you get stuck on the radio mode by accident (the radio sucks, by the way...there is almost no reception) and it is a b*tch to get back to listen to mp3s.recently, it has started to jam up on me. this came out of the blue. my mp3 player has not been dropped, stepped on, or shocked in any way.this player is convient for athletic activity because it is small but I will look for better devices in the future."
4,Very nice little player at a nice price,"I bought this for my daughter who really likes it.Software interface and controls are pretty easy to learn & use.FM radio is excellent as well as the unit's sound.If I had the opportunity to do this over, I would have bought the 500k or 1mb even though this one holds quite bit of music in WMA format.All in all, I'd do it again."
4,Need More Power!,"I love the look of it and the head phones are awesome! (I use them for my laptop as well) However the single AA battery has it's disadvantages, (this could be linked to the fact that I left it on while not using it thereby severly lessening its lifespan) HOWEVER besides that... I love this player!"
2,BEWARE OF THE FIRMWARE UPDATE !,"IMPORTANT UPDATE !I just tried to update the firmware as described in their webpage and the player went totally DEAD ! Don`t do it ! I am waiting for a response from customer service.Old review:This player will not play audible files and doesn`t have a bookmark function, making it pretty much useless as an audiobook player. The resume function is only useful if you don`t change the file. If you stop the book from playing and listen to a song, you loose the resume and it goes back to the beginning.Navigation is also a nightmare. I also have an old Rio 600 which is ten times better in terms of navigation.Otherwise, the sound is good and it is an ok player for those who only want to listen to some mp3s."
2,2 months were great...now not so much,"I really enjoyed this player while working out at the gym for about 2 months, now it won't play WMAs at all. It just skips them or refuses to go into play mode. I spent a few days at the gym just fiddling with the stupid thing. I have tried formatting it, changing the batteries, changing settings...it just will not work. I would recommend trying something different from the Sandisk."
3,Really good player for the price,"A good product. Small enough to fit in your pocket. I still haven't mastered the radio part of it, but I really never use that anyway. The joystick on it is really sensitive. Sometimes when I try to skip back to the beginning of a song, I end up going to the beginning of the previous song. My only real regret is that I should've gotten the 512 MB MP3 player."
4,I love this player!,I ordered this player because I did not want to spend a lot of money. It is so compact! I couldn't believe it. I use it at the gym and just keep it in my purse all times (you never know when you might get stuck in a long line at the groccery store or have to wait). I have even used it in my car with an old adapter from a portable cd player to use with your tape deck. I read the reviews before buying this product. They were right about the menu it is somewhat difficult to use. I usually have it shuffeling my music and therefore do not have to use menu often. I probably will get the i pod someday but will still love this player for the gym and just having around. This was my first mp3 player and I am thrilled!
3,Bought this for my sister,This worked okay for a few months. Didn't hold much and actually just stopped working one day. Tried to fix it but it never turned back on.
1,poor,i dont reccomend this mp3 player.it is junki had it for about a month and it just stopped workingDO NOT BUY IT
2,do not by this mp3 player,"ok...so i have had this mp3 player for about 4 months. i was changing the list of songs on it (that can hold only up to about 45 songs, 50 if you're lucky) and it is totally frozen. I have taken the battery out and put it back in like 5 times, still frozen. DO NOT BY THIS MP3 PLAYER. put down the bucks, if you have them and by an ipod, this is a waste of money."
2,screen efect!,I've just purchased it and after having played one day the screen appears to be defected. There are certain songs in which you can't read the name of the songs. The screen is totally messed up!
2,A So-So Collection,"Any fan of New Wave will likely already have the best of the tracks included on this collection. And what you don't have, you could find at a retail ""Cut-Out"" bin.Some of the transfer quality is questionable. You could probably obtain a better quality by taping your local radio station's ""retro"" 80s show. But as I mentioned, you probably already have ""I Don't Like Monday's"" floating around somewhere!If you see this CD around cheaply, it's worth picking up (to, if nothing else, save you from having to acquire the better songs one by one). There are a couple of cool tunes which take you back, but all in all, the CD is a hit-or-miss collection."
2,HAVE TO AGREE,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. When I started looking down the track listing, I realized I bought this for three cuts (""Love Will Tear Us Apart"", ""Vienna"", and ""Danger"") probobly one of the weaker complations in the series."
2,Quit working when assembled,"My son recieved this bike for his Birthday in 2003.We had some trouble putting it together, but managed itin about a half an hour. However the buttons would not workonce we got it together. talk about disappointed! My son still wonders why they don't work."
1,Arrived a cracked and sloppy mess!,"This was a very poor choice for a gift for my son. The instructions were ridiculous and the nuts and bolts were all out of place and unmarked. The heavy plastic was scratched and scraped. It came with about 30 stickers already on which were scattered all over, falling off, torn, bent, wrinkled, and sloppy and then it was shoved into its box for delivery. I've contacted the TEKNEK company directly about my disgust."
1,Poorly made product,"This is the first time we've actually had a product by this company. This company needs to test all the parts in their products. It took three adults to put almost the whole thing together. The screw that goes on the seat and on the handle did not fit. We took it into a toys r us store and their assembler took an hour and still couldn't put it together. We were told by the store manager that they didn't have a special tool available to them at the time and to pick up the trike a day later. She also told me that if they were unable to assemble the trike that we'd get to exchange for another trike. I'm waiting to pick up the toy.At this point I'm extremely upset, because my 2 yr. old son loved the buttons on the trike and he hasn't even had a chance to ride this trike. I'm definitely calling the manufacturer to complain. I wouldn't recommend this toy to anyone. Save yourself the hassle and grief, and buy a trike from a well known brand. ZC, California"
3,WHY????????,"I bought this spiderman trikw for my nephew. He fell in love with it when I sat him down to see how much growing he had to do before he could reach it, so I ended up buying it for him and the length of time it took me to put it together was riduculous. The screws were difficult, the pieces didnt seem to fit properly. I will never make that mistake again. It ended up taking (2-3) to assemeble it, just wasnt worth it."
2,This is not a light bar.,This item is the mounting bracket kit for the light bar. You might want to try a little harder on your description.
1,DON'T order from Amazon,"If you want to get this item anytime soon DO NOT order it from Amazon. Order it from another vendor instead. It will cost more on shipping but Amazon says it can't be shipped until LATE NOVEMBER. In stock and can't get to you for 2 months? Amazon is NOT THE GUARANTEED LOWEST if you consider the price of the time you have your light bar just sitting in your garage. I rate Amazon 1 star on this one, not the product."
5,Great product,"Works great! No connection issues. The materials are of good quality, and work very well. Exactly what I was looking for."
4,"Clean, efficient readings that could be more eloquent","As a bargain coupling of Dvorak's two most famous chamber works, this CD can't be faulted. The Juilliard Qt. plays with alertness and vivacious rhythms in the 'American' Quartet, and the same forthright style flows over into the Piano Quintet with Rudolf Firkusny, a Czech pianist famed in his day as a Dvorak specialist. Even so, I don't find his playing as eloquent as Richter's in his classic performance on EMI, nor is the quartet as moving and satisfying as with the Alban Berg Qt., also on EMI.Certainly these are enjoyable readings. I just don't find them anywhere near the best to be had on CD, and Sony's rather edgy digital sound, coupled with the Juilliard's somewhat stark sonority, isn't a great asset."
4,A lot of Brushes,Good value for the money. Packaging kind of primitive...would be nice to have some sort of separation instead of being thrown into one bag.
1,Poorly made & Dangerous,"Like many other reviewers have stated, these wire wheels are poorly made and dangerous. At any normal rotational speed, the bristles fly right off of the wheel, embedding them in your skin, clothes, and hair. I'm still finding bristles in my clothes from a project that I did weeks ago.If you absolutely must use these, wear eye protection and a long-sleeve shirt. Don't expect good results since the bristles you need for brushing surfaces will be long gone."
4,Good use for hard to reach delicate places,"Considering the odd, I don't have any alternative to use in cleaning hard to reach areas. This is a good accessories until it last and expect for what it is worth. The problems starts when a few of the fine wire brushes start to fall off due to exerting pressure. That will loosen the hold on rest of the bundle and the wires will start dropping off. Protect yourself. If the wire holder spin on the spindle, solder it back. It does not requires a lot to hold it in place. The first time I have use it, I have no idea what was flying off, I thought those are the remnant from the glue and dirt because I couldn't see the fine wire. I was then clean the copper tubing on the bath tub spout for replacement. When I knelt inside the tub, it like a porcupine hit my knee. It took the use of packing tapes and magnet and still some won't come out, Ouch!."
2,Wear a Face Shield,"Wear a face shield as the wire is not well affixed. I thought I got a lot for the money. Unfortunately, I went through twice as many as the more expensive wire brush wheels."
5,Work Well,"Update: These work fine and haven't given me any trouble.These look fine upon inspection, though I have not yet used them. I'm sure they will wear down quickly under use, but so do my name-brand Dremel brushes."
1,cheap knock offs unsafe?,"In my opinion these are unsafe. Be sure to wear face shield and thick shirt because the wires fly off and stuck in my shirt. My Dremmel tool spins so fast that the bristles flew right out of the wheel, and in my opinion these are unsafe. I will be asking the seller to accept them for a a refund."
1,Easy break,"The wire brush wheel is not strong, wire is too easy to break. Need a lot of brush to finish a small work."
5,Anytime Tools Product and Service,These brass and stainless steel wire brush wheel and cup are excellent. Price was tremendous compared to individual Dremel products. Delivery was fast and packed nicely. Seller has been bookmarked for future purchase.
5,Anytime Tools 24 WIRE BRUSH WHEEL & CUP Brass & Stainless Steel,"Excellent product, very responsible in their sales, are 100% as required, recommended, to deal with you was a real pleasure, thanks for your kind treatment"
1,Don't waste your money,I was shocked when I received these brushes. They are so tiny they will not fit in astandard drill.
4,Economical,"I had some Dremel brand wire brushes that tore themselves up pretty quickly. At a disappointing $3.00 a pop if bought individually at a big box store, they had me looking online for a cheaper alternative.Considering that most of the products Americans consume originate in China, I wouldn't be surprised if Dremel's and these were produced in the same factory, just with different tolerances. Upon use, these brushes do wear out quicker, but at roughly 0.60 each, their price:utility still makes them considerably more affordable than if you were to buy name brand.If you only use wire brushes occasionally for the odd job, save yourself a trip to the store and buy these online. As far as that one star review guy goes, one should always wear safety gear (eye protection, gloves) when operating a rotary tool."
1,Save Your Money,"These wire brushes look like a good deal (24 total, and cheap!), but save your money. When used to clean heat discoloration on mild steel, each brush lasted < 60 seconds, during which time the brushes shot out their wire bristles like a porcupine in a blender (not that I've tried that - but you should definitely wear gloves and eye protection). The bristles are not stiff. They have very little scraping power and shape memory - the bristles that don't immediately fall out bend and twirl, so that your brush quickly looks like the Milky Way Galaxy and becomes useless. Then you spend another 60 seconds changing out the brush for a replacement. Complete waste of money."
2,Use very lightly,"I was trying to bust rust and clean up a Jeep and to get into tight spaces, so I got these. With hard build up of pretty much anything, the wires will come flying out and fly like mini missiles with high RPM's. They will get stuck in your skin. Wear eye protection."
3,"Ok, Watch For Flying Wires","I bought this to wire brush dirt and dust off parts for a pinball machine.It works, but with some caveats..Lots of wires go flying when running these. Use proper protection, I would recommend a face shield instead of just googles. DO NOT USE WITHOUT FACE PROTECTION!The wires wear down quickly... but there are a bunch of wheels in this assortment, I had enough to work through a lot of my hardware.This is not dremel quality tools, but also not dremel price."
5,Best flashlight I have owned,I bought this flashlight to take it hiking at night. With this flashlight its like carying a bit of sunshine in my pocket. The trails illuminate as if it were daytime. The beam is nice and has a long range. I wish the batteries lasted longer. I bought some rechargables from [...] The batteries last throught my 1.5-2.5 hour hike but dont last much longer after that.
5,Excellent Flashlight,"I highly recommend this flashlight I am an inspector and I use it every day and it is always keep it by my side. I can easily see up a 30 story elevator shaft and its very durable, you can buy the batteries cheap online THANKS!!"
5,Amazing,"Insanely powerful, small, and sturdy. I live in a bright city and it still shoot light a quarter mile away."
1,better light half the cost,If you want a light that's better than this for half the cost. You want the 2d led maglite PRO. It shines 388 meters! That's right I said meters!. It's 274 lumens trust me get this instead.
4,Fantastic Pocket Light,"I'm never without it. It puts old, traditional, 4-D cell Mag-Lights to shame! I do notice that the thumb-button is a little less useful than the one on my previous Inova light (Unfortunately lost.) But, I always just twisted the cap to turn it on anyway, so it's a minor inconvenience. The main thing is, it's solid, it's dependable, it's rugged, and in an emergency, if I didn't have it in my pocket, I'd be lost. Very nice, and worthwhile, product. Worth every penny it costs. Night-shift worker for a decade's worth's oath!"
5,Invest in this DURABLE flashlight!,"This flashlight deserves all the hype that it gets. It is so sturdy, bright, stylish, and durable. I dropped it in water, and it survived! I dropped it from my balcony - and it did not get a scratch! Unlike many other flashlights, this one does not consume batteries fast. You can even use rechargeable batteries if need be. Invest in this flashlight instead of buying a cheap plastic one from your local store that wil break down just when a hurricane steals your electricity! This is reliable and will not let you down! I can literally see hundreds of feet away and scare racoons out of my apartment community trash bin! So effective and useful. So worth it."
5,This is one of the best books I have read!,"My stupid teenage cousin got on my computer while I was in the bathroom (I was half finished reviewing this book)and he changed my review and sent it to you. He is an idiot. I don't know what he said, but since he was mad at me about something else, I'm sure it was stupid. I loved this book (as he well knows), and HE has not read it. He reads comic books. Please don't publish the review he sent you. It is a fake. I give the book five stars."
2,It was not very interesting.,I didn't care for it. The author seemed to have put together a bunch of old lectures and made them into this book.
3,"Good articles, just not many of them","This blog has very good articles, mostly about medical research and experimental medications. The articles have links so you can get more info on important topics over Whispernet. The only problem is there just aren't many articles- during the trial I got articles on only five days. There are other blogs that give you a lot more articles about medical news."
5,Strong Defense for Traffic Jams and Road Rage...,"...slip this recording of Johann Strauss' famous waltzes and polkas as rendered by Ormandy and Orchestra, et al, in your car CD or tape player and step into another world in which that guy in the SUV cutting in front of you does not matter to you much. You know that you've heard these great pieces before (the Blue Danube and the orchestral folk music that seem to wind their way in many movies or commercials). They can alter your mood--to relax mode--even if you are not driving. And the price makes this a terribly great product."
3,"Great info, but not for the average person","I enjoyed reading this book as a more intermediate industrial Mechanic, but for that price I expected a book with glossy pictures. I feel the book was over priced for a bunch of pages with drawings. Just a few black and white pics of equipment, and lots of complicated other stuff. The best pic was the cover. To really teach somebody this field you need to be a lot more visual.I wouldn't recommend this book to a beginner. It would be a bit frustrating. But for someone who just wants a reference book with lots of useful information I think this book is for you."
2,Lacks examples + Too much verbiage,This book is two stars instead of 1 because of the terse writing style that the author has. He allows for the reader to develop the common set of vocabulary used among logicians. But the fact that the book rarely presents a solution to a problem is what renders this text inferior to a lot of other logic books. A book on logic should provide lots of examples for the student to follow as well as at least some answers for each of the practice problems that are given. Bonevac leaves the student in the dark about whether or not he has actually answered the questions correctly.The lack of example problems coupled with the lack of answers to practice problems makes this book deserve only two stars.
3,This is worth the money that you pay,"I ordered this one and it came as shown. The hanger chain is made of solid brass and is fairly easy to work with. You can even bend them if you have to.CONS:1) The clear glass shades made it cheap looking. I would recommend non-clear ones.2) The shade is a bit too shallow, not long enough to cover the whole CFL bulb if that's what you have in mind. For those that want to use CFL light bulbs for electricity savings, I recommend something with longer (deeper) shade.3) The ring at the end of the shade is loosely placed on there, and will make noise if you touch it accidently.4) The three-light design is for a small breakfastroom, and would make it a bit cheap looking. So if you have a decent dinging area, or if you are replacing a bigger shandelier or a light with a fan, look for a shandelier with five-lights or at least four lights."
1,"Title is misleading, not what I expected",My problem with this book is that the title: Help Me Speak A Parents Guide to Speech and Language Therapy implies that there are speech and language activites that you can do with your child at home. This is not the case. The correct title should be Why You Should Chose Speech Therapy. This book explains problems that children have and why a child cannot hear. It pushes the need for speech therapy. Which is fine and they are needed but the title is deceptive and I wasted my money. Do not buy this book if you are looking for speech and language activites to do with your child.
4,Beautiful photography & interesting technical history,I love beautiful photography of machines and grew up watching the ore boats off of Cleveland. I couldn't resist buying it and I've enjoyed having it. This is a nice picture book and also has an interesting history of the development and demise of the uniquely configured Great Lakes ships.Jay Heise
4,Good price-value relationship,"For my type of light use - I groom two pet Schnauzers - this table is perfect. It assembled quickly, is sturdy, has a ridged rubberized surface that keeps the dogs from slipping and folds up nicely for storage I would have given it 5 stars except the mechanism for opening and closing the legs is a bit tight and the sides of the metal handles are sharp. I solved the problem with a few wraps of duct tape around the handles."
3,Three organs admitted,"Though a little more cohesive and concise than sloppier lo-fi sessions heard, there also seems to be a lack of the blisteringly introspective guitar runs which generate far more appeal than any sustained aesthetic of eastern influence."
4,Head spinning,"Wow! I love this CD. Sandy is a very gifted player. This CD will have you looking at accordian playing in a whole new way. Forget the old guy playing in a polka band, this stuff is HOT!"
3,Sandy Brechin: scottish celtic rock accordion,"Un album entretenido (instumental completamente). Fundamentalmente compuesto por piezas a base de tonadas encadenadas proyectadas en un estilo agil y vibrante, rítmico, en línea del celtic rock. Buena factura y fusión musical. Incluye también piezas de cadencia más pausada como contrampunto."
4,OK,"Personally, I like lipgloss that has real shine. This lip gloss like many others wears out way too soon and I do not reccommend it. Also, it is too light. It's not real geniune stuff.I do think though that the price was a steal. If you are under the age of 10, it's fun to play with. The price was worth it, just not the gloss itself was great if you want some cute lips for an outing."
4,Discover what Malagasy song was like in the 1930s,"I thought this CD was going to be a boring one since it is a digitally remastered version of a 1930s recording, but I was dead wrong. It is a very old, thus faithfull recording of songs mainly from the Merina Kingdom (Antananarivo.) Many of the songs are still sung today, with slight variation, in Malagasy backyard when kids play or when families gather. The discovery of the record from which this CD was made must have been a great find, but I admire the minds of the people behind the new recording even more. For people who want to find a real, not just the Pop Malagasy music, this is a good CD to have."
4,everyone loves barbies,"The dolls were not secure in the packaging. When I received the bag, parts were all over inside the bag. I had to brush the hair of the dolls to make them look presentable. My daughter loves barbies so she likes these. I like the reuseable bag to hold the barbies and parts. We don't have alot of barbies yet so we don't have places to store them."
5,A complex and compelling drama/tragedy,"Riddled with complex human emotions in a WWII background, this film highlights the tragic dilemmas in the fundamental human nature when they are amplified and distorted by war. Noble cause, greed, patriotism, hatred, love, trust, betrayal, guilt and innocence are all on display here. Very well acted, can be confusing at times due to the complexity in the story. The musical score is also excellent. It reminds me of ""The Lives of Others"", although the moral dilemma is much more poignant."
5,one of the best nazi movies yet.,i love watching war nazi movies. prefer late ones though. mads milkesen is bad to the bone. awesome movies. am sorry i didn't get to see this in a theatre. 5 star movie. seller is great. dvd in perfect condition. must see movie. all actors in film are underrated. should've received oscars for this movie.
3,slow movie,"soooooooooooooooooo slooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwww. good acting, interesting plot, not bad cinematography, boooooooorrrrrrriiiiinnnnnng, movie about guys doing stuff they have to do and learning that sometimes that sucks."
5,Great movie!,"Loved the plot, the actors and I am a fan of WW II movies, so it was perfect! Incredible acting at every level!"
3,Family disagreement,"I found this a interesting story about a rarely covered theatre of WWII, my wife thought it was just OK and my mother (who is Danish) hated it.She informed me that none of her aunts, who lived through it, ever told her stories about that time that mentioned anything violent happening. I asked her if the fact she was nine might be the reason for that. She still hated it.So the rating is a average."
2,bad quality of Instant Video transfer,"I just wanted to note that the quality of the Instant Video version is fairly bad. The screen size of the video is about half normal, the image is blurry and the the subtitles are hard to read due to that same blurriness and how small they are."
5,Good perspective on Vietnam in the 60's,"This book was written and published during the earlier years of America's involvement in Vietnam and gives a unique insight into the attitude of the US military at that time as well as the Vietnamese people in the rural areas controled by the Viet Cong.I was deeply impressed as always at the bravery, dedication and sacrifice of the US Marines in Vietnam.The book was not wriiten in hindsight after the American withdrawal but based on an American's view of the war at that time. The discription of village life and struggle for the people in South Vietnam during that period was unique and informative. I would certainly recommend this book."
4,COIN a la Vietnam,"This was a great story-like lesson book on COIN. I really had a hard time setting it down while I read it on vacation. It couldn't hardly have been better timed as I was reading it heading into the supposed deadline for the ""surge"" in Iraq to be effective...or else the democrats were going to force a Vietnam-like withdrawal.It looks like Patreaus leveraged some of the lessons laid out in The Village.My only complaint was that the book felt a little rough around the edges. It is almost silly to criticize it this way given how that also lent credibility and flavor as it was written by a soldier. But it only moved it to 4 out of 5."
5,Very Good Read,The Village is a very good read while at the same time contains applicable lessons to future wars.
4,The Village,"A tell all story of small unit tactics in Vietnam. Bing West provides the reader insights into how small units can make a difference within much larger conflicts. Additionally, The Village is a must read for all Army Officers who are looking to partake in Combat Advising in Iraq or Afghanistan."
3,Unusual Story,This is a little bit different of a mission than the normal Viet Nam unit booksIt is wortwhile probably better in paperback that Kindle
4,The Village,"I like the way it makes you feel like you are there. Also you could use this on about any village in Viet Nam. The confusing missions and just who was you fighting. This is just like it is now with the Taliban, have seen this first hand you understand and grasp more of the story. Great Book"
2,Tiniest book I ever bought!,"It is 4"" X4"" or so and about 1/8 inch thick so I was surprised at how small it is.The content was ok."
2,Too Small,"This book is too small. The pictures are in color with high resolution. Since the book is small, there was obviously not much room to add anything of substance to FLW's philosophy of integrating fireplaces into his houses. I liked the idea of focusing on FLW fireplaces. It will take you about an hour to read thru it. I think the author created a series of FLW books this size with different topics. If you had the set, they might look good on a small shelf as an academic accessory."
2,Waste of money,"These look nice, that's all.. The sugar dispenser is worthless..takes effort to get the sugar to pour out, and when it finally does pour out you are left with sugar granules left at the opening of the bottle..good way to attract insects. Not a good product."
2,Obese horse abuser.,This book is the story of a greedy fat man who abused horses. He weighed 500 pounds and put his big fat slob self on poor horses' backs. Real Life: He would ride them until he broke their backs and then get others. He exhaused his race horses in race after race without sufficient rest until they were used up and then sold for dog food. A BIG FAT HORSE ABUSING SLOB.
5,"Hammerschmidt, MN",This book was one of the best books I have read. Anna Lee does a wounderful job telling C.B.Erwins life story while keeping the readers attention. I recommend reading all of her books she does a wouderful job!
4,"It's solid, but there *is* one better record.","The second piano cto though published later is really LvB's first so it's not in the same league as the fourth. The fourth holds together better than any of the other cti, though it's not so profound as the third (which Fleisher plays best). The best recording of the fourth is Schnabel's RCA recording with the CSO and Frederick Stock. Though the sound is nowhere near so good as this disk, the playing is the better."
3,"Cute toy, but boring","This toy is cute and cudly and great for bedtime. Although I got it for my kid and they just leave it on their bed. This toy also doesnt look like the care bear, their heads are huge and makes the kids think ""Is this really a care bear?"" I would suggest to buy this toy as an exra gift, not really for a Birthday gift, they sure will be bugging u soon. :-("
5,No one plays the bass guitar like Gerald Veasley!,"Gerald Veasley is one part jazz, one part blues, one part funk, one part soul. His studio stuff is great, but there's nothing like hearing him live... and this disc is a great example of his prowess on stage. My favorite song is ""Forever""... if you can't imagine what the BLUES would sound like on a six-string bass guitar, get ready to have your mind blown. This is amazing stuff!"
5,"Whimscial, illustrated, highly recommended poetry.","Pelican's Belly Can is a whimsically illustrated, highly recommended, picturebook of rhymes for children ages 4 to 8. Tom Noonen has crafted a parade of fantastic animal centered rhymes that assist young readers to learn about unusual and imaginary creatures including ""A Baboon in a Monsoon"", ""A Spaghetti-eating Yeti"", and ""A Peanut Butter and Jelly Fish"". Alison Fredericksen has artfully designed the illustrations and typography to creative an artistic and creative reading experience that will prove very popular with youngsters -- enhancing their love of reading and their appreciation for poetic expression."
4,"My non-intellectual note on ""Contempt""","The movie is of course very complex and a work of art. Now mi little comment written on a day I was on a rage: Some say that this film is about the gradual destruction of a marriage by the husband's insecurities and the contempt this awakens in a simple woman. I see it as the rationalization a beautiful woman does to justify her going after a hunky distasteful rich man. If she is angry with her husband, it seems to be because he put him in a situation where she must choose between power and faithfulness. Of course, she chooses the former. I was very happy to see that her choice ends tragically. (According to the article included in the Criterion edition, others say that Godard was in favor of Camille, but I don't know how this is possible given what we see on screen)."
5,did you know..,"did you know that the opening of this film by goddard was not in his original script? yes, the opening segment with the nude bardot and piccoli was added on after post-production because the studio threatened to shelve the entire film. the studio was outraged that goddard had 'misused' bardot by not showing any nude scenes. goddard compromised by having bardot shot nude in the opening segment, with piccoli reciting a farcical monologue focusing on the studio's obssession with bardot's naked features."
3,BluRay looks like VHS transfer,"Great movie, intriguing, but the picture quality, what a let-down. For a bluray, I was expecting at least dvd quality ransfer, they must have used a lousy can of old film print for this one. Will try the Criterion issue, I advise you do too. Just cause it says 'BluRay' does not mean great quality -be warned"
2,What?,"The blu-ray of this movie looks terrific, as does Bridget Bardot.As to the substance of the film: What? There is about 45 minutes of a couple moping around in a near empty apartment arguing about nothing in particular. This film is the biggest bunch of nothing I've ever seen. Will someone please educate me as to why anyone thinks this nonsense has any merit or worth?"
3,Blu-ray with a few flaws,"A few shots don't seem to fit picture quality of a Blu-ray disc:TC 00:27:22-40;00:29:38-43;00:33:01-34:32;00:36:29-37:05;01:25:47-30:08- total = 5'21""Runtime: 1:42'56""; 24 fpsAspect ratio: 2.35:1, (orig.)Audio: GB, F, D, EST: GB, F, D, E, NL, DK, N, SU, S, JPNRegion Code: A, BChpt.: 12Dual Layer, 47 GB (Film: 29 GB)Bonus:- Introduction by Colin MacCabe [author of""J.-L.

5,I love this series,"These books are so useful to use in rounds and clinics and especially for board review. They have probably been the best review books that I've used yet. I hope they come out with ""In a Page"" books on each sub-specialty."
3,"Good, but not good enough","Both authors wrote mainly and expensively about lack of moral education at Duke and other higher education institutions. They also touch on the purposeful abhorrence of the faculty toward the undergraduates and their neglect in teaching undergraduates. The best part of the book is in Chapter 7, where the authors recommend decoupling the undergraduate education from the university. This is one of the recommendations I have read so far in saving and improving the undergraduate education. But then, this is not a new idea, because we have it already in hundreds and hundreds of small liberal arts colleges, where there are no graduate schools of any sort or research institutes. This is why I give this book 3 stars because the solution is good, but someone else has had it for a long, long time.For a more critical look at American higher education and better recommendations for improvement, read ""The Great Rip-off in American Education."""
1,Does not work,"I have had this item for one month. Despite many hours spent with customer service (most of them ""on hold"") it still does not work properly. Some of the customer service people try to help but several have been quite rude. Now I am shipping it back for service. They will not refund my money nor will they give me a new computer."
4,A little expensive but nice,"The apron is generously-sized and actually quite flattering, not to mention practical. The fabric is linen of average quality (as you might expect from an apron), but looks sturdy. I am pretty happy with it, but would like it better if it cost less. Also WHERE in Eastern Europe was it made? Romania? Belarus? Moldova? I bet you could get it there for 10% of the price. Ah, but such is life.Edit: Whoa, I paid $40 for this and now it's down to $12! That's an amazing deal. Go buy one now."
2,not what I was expecting,"The apron itself is huge, it was much wider than I needed it to be. But then the straps where not as long as I wanted it to be which meant that I couldn't wrap it in front and tie it in the back. Also, I didn't like the dye job. It looks like the colors were just painted over white fabric, so there are flecks of white showing everywhere. Even though I was lucky and got this for $12, I returned it. The white cotton twill reversible bistro apron by the same maker is much better."
4,worked fine,"I used this for about 6 months on Windows XP; admittedly, I had to follow the FAQ to get it installed, and you'd want to read that before even attaching it to your system. So, budget-wise it's a good buy, but it'll take a little extra doing to get it installed, perhaps 15 minutes."
2,It is not good!,"It is supposed to work under Windows XP/sp1, I had struggled hard to install it. XP just can not recognized it, I had to manually select the driver for it, XP can not choose the proper driver from the installation directory. If your system is XP/sp2, you have to follow the FAQ instructions on their website to install it. I doubt if they did necessary test before put it into the market."
3,Does not match up to the silent movie,Bought this for a friend who is into silent movie soundtracks. This is not the movie soundtrack.
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"As with Ms. Plott, I also received a different kettle than the one in the picture. Didn't matter because this kettle is very pretty and the style is just what I wanted so I tried it out soon after I opened it on Christmas Day. It's supposed to whistle but I soon found out it doesn't. I'd expected a pleasing, high pitched sound like one hears on English teakettles. Instead it makes the most Godawful, obnoxious noise that sounds just like a weather alert siren. I've tried it 3 separate times and each time the sound is the same. I'm very disappointed and will return it and try again with a different teakettle."
1,"Fully Alive, Fully Human is ok",I listened to all of this the first cd was pretty basic about positive thinking and making everyday a great daythe second cd was informative to me and helpfulthe third was okthe fourth wore me out with exercises and eating certain foods he is very motherish and demanding. he needs to learn from Joel Osteen who can tell you to quit doing certain things and you love to hear it from him and really want to stop what you are doing that is negative.last cd was good on relaxation and speaking to your subconscious mind or spirit.
3,I like it.,I like 1980's one hit wonders.I bought this cd for the Tim Curry song.I like some of the other songs also.
3,good flow and animated description,"It was nice to read. It has a nice flow. Instead of being the staid and inanimated description of technical and statistical handbooks, the text is really full of life and trivia. It mentions who was sick and who was attempting to bribe, and many trivial facts. Also, it mentions when the yellow and red card were first used, when the Adidas ball was used first. It, however, had some glaring omissions, like not mentioning the plaque at the Atzeca stadium in Mexico City declaring that ""here was played the game of the century"" for the 1970 semifinal, and surprisingly not mentioning the 18-year old Rivera that did some magic. Given the very animated descriptions of memorable games, I consider this book very valuable for those that want to search for video clips in YouTube, now that many people around the globe are digitizing clips of video for the rest of us to scavenge and watch."
4,An Enthusiastic World Cup History Review,What a fun book! This book was published as a guide to the 2006 World Cup. It gives a history of all the World Cup tournaments that have come before with some emphasis on the exploits and great goals of the South American and Latin American contestants.The guide has thumbnail sketches on each team involved in the 2006 World Cup and a tourist guide to the German cities that hosted the cup.What sets this book apart from others in a similar vein is Mr. Fiore's enthusiasm and sense of humor that jumps off of every page. Reading this book is like having a pre-tourney World Cup history lesson from a friend who is a rabid futbol fan.Post-2006 this is still a great book for anyone who wants to learn what happened in past World Cups and anyone planning a trip to Germany.
5,Great Resource and Bibliography,I bought this book to help me out with a paper I was writing on Gothic Literature in a feminist context. This book was exactly what I was looking for and pointed me towards many other authors to look into that I had not heard of before. The overall focus of the book is fascinating if you're into Gothic novels and especially the complex way females are depicted and used within them.
2,"No theory of operation included, instruction not very logical","This kit is OK but the directions are not well done. They are complete in a sense. But it looks like the instructions were written to work with more than one type of kit. My main complaint is that the kit does not include any theory of operation (i.e. how the circuit works). So even if you build this kit you don't really learn anything about amplifier circuits (unless you already happen to know what all the components do). Also, the finished kit really doesn't make sense because if you want to hear something far away most likely you want a directional microphone, not two divergent microphones."
1,If you are looking a for a manual with this forget about it,There is no manual that helps you put this thing together. If you are a starter with soldering and have no clue about resitors and are looking for an easy starter kit this is not the item for you. You would have to enlarge this picture of the item and do the guess work from there. What a waste!
5,love,As in regards to the message i left earlier i thought i rated it 4. i loved it and hope you have more from them in ther fuure
5,Between Gould & Tureck Is Joy,An excellent set of Goldberg Variations from Charles Rosen. At 75 minutes it falls nicely between Gould (38) and Tureck (90) in terms of time and overall tempo. Very straightforward and well played...an artist who is thoughtful but unobtrusive. I take this one over either Gould or Tureck (I know-heresy!).
5,Shows How Good Cale is,"Seducing down the door is an excellent overview of John Cale's career after the Velvet Underground. It really shows how much Cale changed over the years; The beautiful Beatlesque Parisi 1919 to the wrenching Fear is A Man's Best Friend and Gun to his dismal cover of Heartbreak Hotel to the great Jack The Ripper to the peaceful Strange Times in Casablanca to his songs with Lou Reed Trouble With Classicists and Faces and Names. If you are looking for only one album to get by John Cale, Seducing Down The Door is the best choice. It is just about one step away from a box set. Buy It."
5,Well worth the money,"I agree with Top Cat's review above - fantastic sound quality, better than MK III Final Concerts (though that is good too) and overall a GREAT live show. Probably my favorite live Deep Purple, at least from the Coverdale/Hughes era. Highly recommended!"
3,money maker & marketing strategy from a record company!,"this new cd set signifies the same album ""The Mark III final concerts 1975"". The Mark III final concerts is a double CD set which was released by Connoisseur record company in the UK for 4 years ago.It is important to know:There is no new surprise in this new remixed cd set. The incredible rare songs, what Deep Purple Mark III with Ritchie Blackmore played that night in Paris - France 1975 like burn, stormbringer, gypsy, mistreated, smoke on the water, going down, highway star, lady double dealer, mistreated etc... were already released in the same full cd set in ""The Mark III final concerts 1975"". So do not waste your money for buying this one. If you already had bought another one (by Connoisseur record company /UK import released), keep your finger from this! This one is the same set and the same show in Paris - France 1975!therefore I gave this only 3 stars!cheerslong time ago deep purple collector and fan"
1,Hello Editing,"The first thing I always consider when writing a review is to verify the facts. The ""Kill Bill"" moniker, for example, I don't know where Okinowa is, possibly north of Chicago. The island of ""Okinawa"" in the Ryuku chain, however, has been known for centuries as a crossroads of the martial way."
2,I pay attention to detail,I had ordered the bride's sword and received Bud's sword instead. Still a cool product for $20... BUT not what I had expected.
2,Not that cute,"This book has a cute idea in that the pages make a fun image at the end. However, it only has eight pages and the artwork is not that great. I sell artwork and this did not impress me. In fact, the black cat has a big pink [...]! Gross! That's not a part of our cat's anatomy I want my 17 month old to focus on. There are so many more wonderful books than this one with even better images. A fantastic interactive progression book is Carle's The Grouchy Ladybug. And, by the way, most of my son's books about color DO mention black and white."
3,A great historian; only an average biography,"This is a biography of the famous American romantic narrative historian who made the Hispanic world his subject. He had wealth and time and went about his historical tasks as if they were pre-ordained. Sir Walter Scott was his hero. An eye injury in college hindered his sight, meaning much of his research was read to him; but he was not blind. (It's amazing how our two greatest narrative historians, Prescott and Francis Parkman, could barely see.) He also had a lazy streak, and an addiction to writing for the North American Review, both of which cut into his historical writing work. Gardiner's biography is well written, but not deep; little is said about Prescott's works, and the ending is very rushed. Not a definitive biography by any means."
5,what it b like,luni and damu you know it's hot. good bet's and spit's this real tight. Damu put it down 4 us blood and luni was all right.
2,not that great,These are not good quality... they barely fit the car and they are not even close to being flush with the rest of the front end... trust me... go with original OEM BMW parts for these front signals.
2,charm but not much depth,"Charm but not much depth, cello and a voice that can imitate instruments that usually imitate voice. Both artists are exquisite musicians, but the overall effect is less than inspiring."
1,disappointing,"While I have the utmost respect for Yo-Yo Ma, I was looking for something quintessentially McFerrin, to start, and this was not it. There was one piece I'd heard before that led me to it, Coyote, which I like, but most of the rest was just too abstract for what I wanted. Will probably give away if I can't sell it."
4,You can hear the fun the two are having,"Some recordings sound polished and elegant. Some sound like the artists are having a blast while they're recording. ""Hush"" is a delightful mix of both.Most of the songs are pretty quiet save for my three favorites. You've got a lot of traditional and classical music with Master Ma's beautiful playing and McFerrin's incredibly versatile voice.My favorites:""Hush"" with lyrics by McFerrin""Hoedown"" with vocal riffing by McFerrin""Flight of the Bumblebee"" probably the most fun the pair hadRebecca Kyle, December 2008"
5,stunning,"The angels in Heaven would stop to listen to McFerrin's lyrical voice.The improvisational beauty of these two great artists is amazing. McFerrin never is afraid to show the joyousness that he feels towards life. His composition, ""Stars"", was rythemically facinating. I borrowed this tape from the library and was loath to return it. This was my first on-line music purchase. Multiple listenings do not diminish the pleasure of this music."
3,"Slightly irritating but worthwhile, like all mom-daughter relationships","Not my favorite Wharton, but a fast, compelling read all the same. A woman who, in earlier years, deserted her husband and young daughter, finds her way back cleared by the passage of time and some convenient deaths. All is peachy until the mother finds her grown daughter attracted to man she herself has been involved with.As a strong believer in the power of confession, I admit to impatience with secrets driving a plot, and I experienced irritation with Kate Clephane that approached Tess Durbeyfield proportions. Just say something, already! Daughter Anne was so earnest and intense that she needed a dose of truth.I'm reaching the end of Wharton's major works, which is a bummer. At some point I may have to break down and read the short stories."
3,"""Naturally Young"" prostate shrinker","Have been using for a month and have seen some benefit, although nothing drastic. Am hoping results are stronger after taking longer."
1,no luck at all with this product,"First of all thinking I was ordering the same brand I always use but in a different package,not so,you take 2 daily not 1 so its a 30 day supply ,this product did not work for me at all,I used it for 2wks then ordered the prostalex plus that comes in the box,your best bet"
5,"prostalex plus, great product","Was having problems trying to empty my bladder, or was going all the time. The doctor prescribed flomax, used that for about 2 weeks and it really didn't helpmy problem. The only thing it did for me was cause unwelcomed side effects, have been taking Prostalex Plus for 3 months and everything has beed working properly.I think this is a great product.Pete"
1,Didn't work for me,"I've been diagnosed with an enlarged prostrate resulting in frequent urination during the night. This product claimed a high probability of remedy. For me, it provided absolutely no improvement."
2,Did nothing for me.,"I am taking Avadart and thought I would try Prostalex, because I am still having trouble going at night. I took theProstalex for 30 days and noticed no improvement."
2,"Fast Service, but not quite the item I expected","The supplier was great as far as the service. I received my merchandise quickly in in great shape. The merchandise was not as I expected, meant for youngsters, not adults."
3,Not ideal for rats,"One thing the product description leaves out is the size of the gap between each bar. They are about 1 inch apart from each other which is more than enough for young rats to get through. Currently my rats can get through their cage bars which are about 1 inch apart also so I haven't actually used this yet due to the escape possibilities.Once my rats have aged a bit, grown some more and put on some weight then I'll bring this out for them to play in but at the moment it is just sat in storage.The actual quality is fine, would just be nice for them to include bar spacing measurements on their product description."
3,Don't buy for a ferrett or it will get it's head stuck between uprights.,The spaces between the upright bars are wide enough for your ferret to wedge them open and get it's head stuck. They need to add another horizontal bar to add stiffness to the uprights. Very dangerous for a ferret and is poorly designed.
4,"Love the high walls, and the easy assembly. But uses thin metal","Bought this for 2 house rabbits, and it works great. The walls are high enough that it prevented the rabbits from trying to jump out, and the room that it affords them to run around is a step and a leap above the cage we were keeping them in before. I keep the sliding door off, and just connect it with the cage, and it gives them plenty of space, and access to both areas. It is pretty light though, and they can push it around pretty easily. We have it butted up against a wall, and the cage pressed against it to prevent it. The wire is really thin though, and the door's bottom wire snapped after a few weeks, but the main cage area is still holding up. I do wish they used higher grade material, but it's the best on the market right now so until I can make one myself, I'll take it."
2,Not Alcatraz,"My two pet rats must be super rats, because they can shimmy up the wires and escape from this pen. They managed to escape within 2 minutes of being in the pen. I did manage to rig it so they cannot escape by zip-tying linoleum to the top portion of the pen instead of returning it. With the adjustments I made, it was still cheaper than most rat play pens for sale."
3,hi,still have not gotten it due to the UPS driver i stuck a note to take it to the rental office because i got called into work they didnt then took it to the office on the last day to get it due to they was going to be closed all weekend. so if you can spend more money dont send or recieve nothin through UPS very very slow but i sure ill like it
2,Wanted to like it but...,"I have certainly read and heard mention of Mose Allison for a long time, but had not heard his music. After reading some of the reviews I became interested and decided to check him out. I have listened to the whole anthology several times and have come to the conclusion that I just don't care for his voice. I like the music, I like his piano playing to an extent but his voice and vocal delivery just don't do it for me. Just a personal preference thing."
4,Mose Knows!,"As far as collections go, it is hard to top these handsome sets that Atlantic puts out. Allison Wonderland is no exception. The selections cover pretty much all of Allison's career with a special emphasis on his early ground-breaking works. The booklet is packed with photos and insights into his music.Mose Allison had a wonderful way of reshaping country blues into jazz and has been a big influence on later musicians like Bill Frisell, not to mention all the rock stars who have borrowed from him over the years, or paid tribute to him, such asVan Morrison. His phrasing and lyricism can't be beat, from immortal songs like Seventh Son to more recent renditions of Josephine. He reminds me a little of Bob Dylan in the way he mines American music for themes and standards, reworking them so that they become distinctly his own. Only, he has been at it a lot longer, and this anthology only scratches the surface of his great discography."
5,Best Kept Jazz Secret,"Mose Allison is still with us - he'd be 79 years old - and out there still entertaining discerning fans with his easy blend of Sonny Boy Williamson, John Lee Hooker, Duke Ellington and Charlie Parker. Like folk-blues singer/guitarist Snooks Eaglin he is a largely hidden gem who should be brought into national prominence through appearances on some of those ubiquitous talk shows.Just listen to his composition Back Country Suite, first heard way back in 1957 when he recorded for the Prestige label and which was the subject of critical - if not popular - acclaim. Or Parchman Farm, and Seventh Son, and I Love The Life I Live which, with many others from his repertoire, influenced a whole slew of artists throughout the 1960s.Well worth the hefty price."
1,Quickie Easy means I Quickly and Easially determined wringer is a piece of junk,"I saw this same product at Lowe's and though long and hard about buying it.*But* that wringer just did not seem well designed. I was able to assemble it in the store and it did not move smoothly and I seriously doubted I could wring the mop dry enough for my floor needs. The size and weight of the bucket is great but that wringer... I decided to think about it and do more research.The reviews of those who bought this thing confirmed my fears. This also increased my confidence in Amazon customer reviews. So... Don't waste your time and money on this product. If I find a good one within my budget, I'll let you all know."
2,not impressed,The metal handle is connected to a plastic hub which streached with the first use. Now I have limited mobility for the wringer.
1,Quickie Easy Glide Mop Bucket with Wringer,I bought this Mop Bucket at Lowe's it is very poor quality rollers keep coming off and wringer is a piece of junk spend the extra dollars for better one. Returning mine tomorrow to Lowe's will be ordering better one from Amazon!!!
2,Dissapointed,I allways wanted a mop bucket with a ringerand thought for home use this product would be fine. Wrong! It is flemsey and the wheels have not rolled ever and they are supposed to!. It comes apart when I am trying to use it and makes a chore hell.
1,"I'd expect the ""Dollar Tree"" stores to sell this contraption","I purchased this bucket at Lowes. I'm taking it back today. 1) The wheels don't stay on. 2) The handle doesn't stay on. 3) The squeezing mechanism pushes against the bucket itself and doesn't stay on. 4) The handle doesn't stay in place. 5) The name is just dreadful. Imagine a big box on your doorstep that says Quickie Easy Glide.A swab and bucket is the only way to go in a large house. Do yourself a favor and order the Genuine Joe bucket. I received it the very next day, no joke. Same price, $5 bucks for shipping. Dudes, I'm a stay at home Mommy....I don't work for the company."
1,Terrible,"As other reviewers have mentioned, the wringer is worthless. I also wanted to point out how tiny it is. It won't even take care of one room! There is no way to hold the bucket and the mop when trying to wring. And it doesn't travel well. Although the awful wringer is the worst of the problems with this product, it is not the only problem.Wast of money!!! Don't bother!!!"
2,You get what you pay for,"Like the title says, you get what you pay for. I moved into a house with tile in almost every room. This thing is so cheap & flimsy. 1st, the handle is slid into place when assembling which makes it flimsy & definitely is not strong enough for a good wringing. 2nd, the 2 brackets that hold up the wringer will easily slide out of place. The first time this happened, I was deep in wringing mode when the brackets gave out.i almost broke my arm & had a faceful of nasty mop water. Comical now but @ the time I was pissed. 3rd, the handle is awkward, like not quite big enough for the bucket size. Makes it hard to pull around. Took me forever to mop the floor & ended up with a more wet than a normal last good wringing sweep of the floor should be account not taking anymore chances to bite the bucket. This ""cheap"" bucket was not so cheap in price. Spend a little more money & get the tried & true yellow industrial one. It's amazing what a good wring will do!"
4,Bucket on wheels,Perfect bucket on wheels to use when washing the car. You can wring out the cloths and be ready to use them on the next car wash.
2,junk wheels on bucket,the wheels keep poping off [even when empty] so i'll just drag it around where i need it instead of useing it the way it's meant to be used! i should of just bought the rinser and used it with a plain mop bucket maybe i'll try to crazy glue the wheels on?
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,THAY SAY YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR BUT NOT IN THIS CASE REALY REALY REALY CHEAP .SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET THE REAL THING.FOR TRASH IT GETS 5 STARS
1,Snap,If you use enough pressure to wring out your mop the wringer slips off the edge of the bucket. Cheap hollow practice for support....
3,ok bucket,sturdy bucket and casters but wringer is absolutely crap - I use it primarily to wash my car and outside in the driveway so no need for wringer much - they should price it better and make the wringer optional
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this mop bucket locally thinking I didn't need one of the more expensive ones for occasional use. Just like other reviewers have described, the metal handle wringer goes through a hole in one side, engages a wimpy all plastic wringer shaft. Mine hasn't broken yet but deforms and twists terribly and and just about breaks apart. And if I really tried to wring all the water out I'm sure it would break. And this was observed almost immediately. The standard mop heads just barely fit in the wringer. The wringer wants to fall in or out of the bucket all the time as well. I should have just returned it and upgraded to a pro unit but didn't get around to it."
5,Hat looks great!,The hat arrived quickly and looks great. My husband really likes it. He wears about a 7 3/4 in fitted hats and the L/XL fits him well.
5,Astros ROCK,"Measure your head before you buy it, its fitted fools! The trim on the hat curves around the brim and over the ears! My buddy says it's like a wheel well for my ear. So If you hate your ears, or have objectionable ears do not buy this hat! Buy it and support TEXAS!"
2,Disappointed,"Sounds fine. Can't hear any difference between this cable, cheap digital cable and hi-end cables. However, this item looks better in the ads then actual use. The 'Lighted' Halo end barely lights and only at the tip, and more importantly to me, the connector ends are all round. Not a typycal shaped Toslink type connector. It fits into the Toslink digital jacks, but not well or tight. Doesn't really lock in like a good Toslink either. The cable itself looks cool though its doesn't light, but feels like cheap hallow plastic. More of a gimmick then anything else. I don't hate it, but another 'miss' from RCA."
2,The values of each attribute shoud be added.,"The book has a very completed list of all of the tags and their attributes. However, no possible values for the attributes are listed. For people to learn HTML or to use this book as a reference book, this information is very important."
4,A SATISFACTORY RESOURCE,"First and foremost, this edition of ""HTML & XHTML: The Definitive Guide"" is a well-written book. The use of simple language throughout the chapters make them very comprehensible. I really appreciate the way it handled the cascading style sheets, tables, forms, and so on.However, I cannot understand the reason why the authors of this book included all the tags and attributes, and then decided to exclude all the attribute values. For this reason, I would not recommend it for anyone who is still learning the basics of HTML.Intermediate (and advanced) learners should pay closer attention to it. It simplified both the Syntax and the Semantics. Also, the extensive coverage it gave Internet Explorer 6, Netscape Navigator 6.0, JavaScript, and a host of others, are satisfactory.Overall, this textbook will prove a useful resource for any HTML non-beginner."
4,Everything and Out of Date,"This books takes a very progressive look at HTML and then shows how XHTML differs at the end. If there is a tag or attribute, whether valid or not, this book covers it in enough detail to quench any web author's needs. I already had a firm grasp on HTML, but I learned a few new things throughout the book (I read it cover to cover). My only complaint is that it is a little outdated. It also dedicates a whole chapter to unused tags (a bit much), but it nice to know about these things. It gives a very good tour of CSS and forms. Good as a reference."
3,"crazy, but you have to love it","I've seen this film and heard the music, being in a Rocky cast makes that a given. Although I like the Shock Treatment music, I would not say that it is better than Rocky--Rocky is like a rock opera and the music fits that genre. The music on ST is not meant to be taken as a serious work, but it is still great-therein lies the genius of Richard O'Brien. He can take ridiculous subject matter and make us all like it."
4,"This album ""gets you jumping like a real live wire.""","The album is full of lively, intense music and stands independently of its ""equal,"" ""Rocky Horror."" The songs are intelligently written and fit the mood of the movie quite well. It's a fun listen, even if you don't care for ""cult classics."" The satire in the lyrics is keen as well. The lyrics, as well as the movie, were 20 years ahead of their time, depicting quite admirably a future in which everyone has a show and in which those not on television less than nothing."
2,The closest thing ever to a Rocky Horror Picture Show sequel,"Shock Treatment was Richard O'Brien's follow up to The Rocky Horror Picture Show. It's surreal musical plot focused on a town that lived in a TV studio, Denton, the Home of Happiness. The music is carefree and fun, it doesn't hold any of the darker images of TRHPS, and it is hokey, but most of all, it is infectious. Each tune is a bouncy, stuck-in-your-head masterpiece. For silly, eighties forgotten pop, Shock Treatment is a lost classic."
3,Advice to consider,"I have no reason to believe the Ngakpa Chogyam is anything other than an authentic and fine teacher, and I have been reading his book ""Roaring Silence"" (which is why I checked these reviews). HOWEVER, most of the reviews are clearly by his students who review his books and his books alone. Not really my idea of the best source of unbiased review material, and I can only hope he doesn't encourage his students to do this. Cheers!"
4,Most Practical Explanation I Have Found,"This is the most practical, useful explanation of the five-fold elemental system in Vajrayana Buddhism I have found. The authors really explain the function of the five elements as a system of psycho-physical tools, not . They discuss the symbolism of the Five Buddha Families from the Outer Tantras, which has been described in many different books, and explain how this relates to subtle systems from Inner Tantra and Dzogchen. These symbolic systems are explained as practical methods for helping us to see the ways we express both the neurotic human distortions of our enlightened nature and that nature itself."
5,"Songs Of The West, Vol. 4: Movie & Television Themes","A must have for anyone that enjoys Westerns, but for those fifty plus it will have special meaning as this is the ""Original"" music used on several movies and TV series. It is rare you will see a compilation of the original artist that sang the songs, or studio recordings. If you enjoyed the Westerns in movies and TV in the 60s and 70s you will want to own this excellent CD. Great quality and lots of replayability.CA Luster"
4,B+W 62mm Circular Polarizer,"I am not sure how long they will last, since there is no coating, but while they new shooting with them is so much better than with chip brand names filters. Great product for the money"
4,Much easier to handle,"I tried the liquid propolis first, as I had planned on mixing it with my drinks. That was a major fail as nothing would mask the taste or smell to even get it close to my mouth( the taste was horrendous). I was skeptical buying this fearing that the taste was just as nasty. Pleasantly surprised when I tried it and it actually tasted good. Just the right amount of sweet. Definitely going to keep using this product."
5,tastes better and easier to take than other presentations,"I first had propolis 30 years ago, and still use it a lot today - every time anybody in my family starts with a cold. It is excellent for general colds as well as respiratory problems. It boosts immunity naturally and taking it everyday in the cold months has helped us not to get the most current virus at school...Great also for the kids (2 and older) they take it just fine. Easier to take than the normal presentation with Alcohol or water when you have to dilute them with drinks or mix with Honey.I highly recommend this product to the whole family."
4,Indiferent,"A decent product, tastes pretty good, but I didn't feel worse or better after taking it... I was told it's good for you, but I'm a generally healthy person so it didn't really affect me in any way."
5,Great buy!,"Our family plays sand volleyball every Sunday at the park. We used these yesterday -- what a good buy. These lines are EASY to set up and easy to take down...provided that family members actually help out (teenagers...). Orange is definitely easy to see. We didn't have unexpected problems with visibility, texture, durability. I would NOT have preferred to build my own."
2,Meh,"The preview looks much better than the movie itself. Sort of depressing and definitely hard to root for anyone here. In short, rent something else."
3,mexican film,big fan of gael garcia bernal and diego luna but the storyline was so fast that it seems ridiculous. a story of two brothers who come from nothing (with futbol talents) and hit fame and fortune overnight. seems to easy in the film to lasso your dreams! i would see it if you have nothing better to watch!
2,Disapointing !,I normally enjoy Gael Garcia Bernal's films this was his worst part.It's boring and not really funnyIt's tacky!
3,"Technically proficient, but unemotional and flat","This is a beautiful piece of music, and there's no question that the performers are technically adept. However, compare this recording to the one by Rostropovich & Serkin and it's clear that Ma and Ax don't feel the piece in the same way. I found it precise, but lacking the richness and delicacy of the other recording. That being said, I imagine that on its own it probably stands as a nice recording."
4,Gift,"Since this recording was a gift to my daughter, who has resumed playing her flute after law school and a demanding law practice is in place, I have not heard it. My daughter, however, reports she listens to it each day driving to and from her work. Must be good."
5,Excellent Timer,"This timer is very complete and the internal battery does help if the lights go off. In addition, it has a button to turn on the heater without changing the heater. Just make sure that voltage of the one you are buying is the correct one. In case your heater is 220 and not 110."
5,Wiring diagram confusing,"The enclosed wiring diagram is confusing. When the enclosed jumper wire is used between terminals #2 and 3, then terminal #4 becomes the positive load connection, and the load neutral wire then connects with neutral from power source at terminal #1. Why they make you use a jumper wire on a 120V timer is the question. These timers should be pre-wired for the advertised voltage.Other than that, these timers are the best available."
1,A piece of junk!,"This computer is great for the home - if it works! Less than a year after we got it, the hard drive totally fried! And we are not a family of heavy users - we average maybe 2-3 hrs a day. Like the other reviewer, we found Customer Support to be a total waste of time. We wasted 10+ hours on the phone with them, all the while they tried pushing the problem onto us before (finally!) getting permission to return the computer so they can fix the problem.Then, when the computer returned, we had to, of course, go through all the hassle, yet again, of loading and reloading software. Another 7 months went by and now, the computer's on the blink - again! This time, problem reading the CD/DVD drive! My question is - did tech support actually fixed the problem or just re-installed re-cond parts? Or is this an inherent problem in ALL Compaq computers? Can't wait to waste yet another 10+ hours with their lovely support people again!Last word - ""Should have bought a Dell!"""
1,A Complicated Mess. Dr. Symington's' Pseudo-Philosophy is an Unfortunate Disaster.,"I am a psychiatrist with a background in philosophy. As such, I had great hopes for this book. What I found, however, was almost unreadable. Dr. Symington's writing is niether clear nor concise. His incomplete logic, mixed metaphors, and poorly thought out conclusions indicate little more than muddy thinking. Most of his foundational conclusions . . . and even idiosynchratic wording of certain ideas . . . have been clearly stolen from well established philosophical traditions and sewn together in a way that lacks logical integrity. I wish I could recommend this book, but I cannot. Complicated, abstruse, and even incohenet passages may masquerade as genius to some, but in truth reflect only unclear thinking. I'm not sure even Dr. Symington knows what he's trying to say."
3,Sweatshirt is everything it is supposed to be but...,The only thing wrong with the sweatshirt itself id that the drawstring on the hood is frayed in one spot. The reason I rated this transaction low was due to the extremely long shipping time. They didn't even ship for over 2 weeks and it was close to a month after I placed my order that I finally had it.
5,hoodie was perfect,This gift was for my 17 year old son and he just loves it. Can hardly get it off him to wash it!
2,"The quality is first class, the fit is terrible","Carhartt always makes high quality products based on my experience. I love hooded sweatshirts and decided to upgrade the quality a bit, so I spent a bit more for this Carhartt hoody. I bought a tall size since I am 6' 6"" and have trouble finding clothes that fit. To my surprise, this thing was huge! I wears like a dress and I look like I'm four years old when I have it on.If you are 6' 9"" or better, order this product without worry. I know you guys have it tough too, so this one is a win for you."
5,Very Nice Quality,This is a very nice quality hoodie. It is heavier than other fabrics and washed beautifully. Nice colors and true to size.
1,Not the quality I expected,I bought this knowing the Carhartt quality. This was a disappointment. The hood is too loose to be useful. The fabric is so thin that the wind whips right through it. Feels like I don't have a sweatshirt on. The zipper does not smoothly go up and down. Overall this is not worth the price.
1,Never recieved product,Do not order from this seller. I had ordered this product in the beginning/middle of January of 2013 and it is now the 5th of February. I have tried to contact the seller back at the end of January but have not heard anything so I am just going to cancel the order.
4,hooded sweatshirt with a hood,car hart has the greatest products carhart sweat shirt with a hood. interior is soft and comfortableto wear.the greatest
4,Great Fit and Color,"Great hoodie. I got the dark tan in large. It's true to size and warm if you zip it up.My only negative is the soft inside fleece starts to ball up after a few weeks. There aren't any lint balls coming off of it, but it doesn't stay new looking for long. Still a great purchase."
5,Great work/sweatshirt,"I know, these are very expensive , however, Iust admit they last forever and are very durable. My husband works outside and these keep him warm, wash well ( wash after wash after wash.....) and stay looking nice. Well worth the extra $$$ in the long run and I will buy again."
5,A Christmas gift,"I bought this for a Christmas gift for my adult son, who loves this sweatshirt brand and has many. They wash very well over, and over. I have washed these with Spray-n-Wash on oil spots as well. Very much worth the money because they last so long."
3,navy is navy,the color is almost exact same as navy. arms way too long on 2xl. had to return for xl. new navy is old navy.
2,Received wrong size,I ordered an X-Large Regular but received an X-Large Tall instead. Will be returning for refund. Gave it two stars instead of one because the color does seem to match what's shown in the picture and the fabric does look somewhat durable.
5,What can i say? It's Carhartt.,The heavyweights the one. Outdoor work or play. Chilly or freezing. The goto hoodie. I've got two. You have to do laundry sometime.
4,A good light weight jacket,"I like the jacket. Good quality fabric and zipper. For sweatshirt material, I don't consider this a mid-weight jacket. It's definitely a light weight jacket in my opinion. Also, it's a little big on me, but not enough to make me want to return it. Like most clothes that I shop for these days, manufacturers seem to be up-sizing clothing for the sake of peoples vanity (being able to still buy a medium when they really should be buying a large, Large to XL, etc.) So before you buy, make sure you want a light weight sweatshirt jacket, and choose a size down from what you would normally buy."
3,Nice Hoodie the Zipper Ruins,"From a quality standpoint, I think it is what you expect from Carhartt. It is a little rugged inside but it's built for people who are layering their clothing for working or playing outside. There is nothing that particularly stands out to me which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's your standard hooded sweatshirt that seems like it is built to last many years of washes.My gripe those is with the zipper. It's a strong brass zipper that doesn't have a lot of flexbility to it. This leads to an awkward fit near the bottom. The last few inches sort of lock into place and don't fall naturally. It's tough to explain, but with most hooded sweatshirts, the zipper is more flexibile and doesn't cause the stiffness or ripples that this one does. It might not bother people wearing this strictly as a jacket, but I don't think it makes it a great hoodie."
5,My son loves this sweatshirt.,I bought this hoodie for my oldest son for his birthday. He told me he just loved it! He said the fit was good and it was very warm for the fall weather.
4,Basic playyard,Needed playyard with no extras to use with grandson. This was just what I needed at a resonable price. It is easy to put up and take down. Folds very compactly for storage. Is durable and safe.
1,Couldn't get it to stay open,"My husband and I just spent over 30 minutes trying to get this thing open and then trying to completely break it down to put it back in the box. Needless to say, we will be returning it. The sides wouldn't lock into place and then, when we were trying to close it, the legs would lock. I don't know if this was just a defective playard or if they are all that difficult."
4,good product for the price,this playard was definately a good product for the price. the only problem is how to set it up. i have a bit of a hard time being that you have to snap in the sides before you can flatten the sleeping area. the good thing is there are instructions printed right on the bottom of the playard. i would definately recommend this product.
1,way too much trouble,we never could get one side to lock up. and then when we tried to close it up to return it it was almost impossible to unlock the other three sides. we are returning it right away
1,Difficult,"This is not easy at all to put together. We have one at home the is very easy to pack up and put down (Graco) for when we go away. I bought this one to keep at my mother's house so she has something to put my daughter in the one day a week she has her, but we will be returning it because she cannot easily fold it up to store away for the rest of the week. I strongly urge you to choose another product."
1,Absolutely Defected,"My husband and I bought this play yard from Toys R Us. When we went to put it together, it only had three out of four legs. One side of the play yard was broken and would not lock, and the bag that it came with was completely SHREDDED. In speaking with the customer service rep, they wanted US to pay to have it shipped back and insured in order to get a new play yard. Forget that! It went back to Toys R Us!"
1,NOT USER FRIENDLY!,"My husband and I just spent over an hour and a half trying to get this thing open and then trying to completely break it down again to put it back in the box. My 73 year old mother wanted something she could set up and take down without much fuss. Needless to say, we will be returning it. The sides wouldn't lock into place and then, when we were trying to close it, the legs would lock. I don't know if this was just a defective playard or if they are all that difficult. Talk about a three ring circus! Certainly in no way is this item user friendly!"
2,Seen better....,I am a fourth grade teacher and didn't find this book usefull at all.... Maybe for lower grades it is better. I would recommend the book Spell Well and Spelling Activities for Any Spelling Unit ( I think that's the name).
3,I left my sneakers in demension x,"Rod has his cousin Elspeth are playing around while they're on break from school Elspeth is just visiting. While they were playing, all of a sudden they get kiddnapped by Smorkus Flinders an alien from demension X. He holds them hostage in order to capture his friend. WHile he spends time with some apprenticing and shapeshifters to the warrior Tar Gibbons, Rod starts to gain confidents and can do things better than before. While he is out there he has to save the universe. So to find out you hace to read the book. I only gave it 3 stars because its not my kind of book, its to fake. By: Ricky Pena"
1,ya'll must be crazy,these people who give this soundtrack 5 stars are sick in the head you cant be serious this is pure junk they act like this is classic music this stuff is trash
4,School Daze Soundtrack,"I loved all of the songs. Spike Lee's day, Bill Lee produced most and wrote some of the songs from this movie and I am a fan. Not one of Spike's most popular movies, but I enjoyed it."
4,Inseperable..,"If you bought the movie, you'll want the soundtrack. The deluxe version actually comes with it!"
4,Spike Lee Flick,"This is one of my favorite Spike Lee flicks! Though the end of the movie is a bit over the top, the message is quite clear."
3,"More familiars, but not much more.","Dweomercraft Familiars finds its rhythm mostly in providing an extensive list of alternative familiars and animal companions (some of the contents can certainly be used as animal companions). It expands on the ideas of constructs and other creatures as familiars, as well, with a wide variety of feats and spells related to familiars. While not necessarily exciting, it also contains a considerable amount of statistics for animals and other creatures that can be magical pets. Dweomercraft Familiars falters with rough writing and some rules with questionable balance."
3,doesn'st last long but smells good,this is a nice body mist really feminine and refreshing but the scent only lasts a few hours if even that .wouldnt buy again.
2,A little shocking,"I purchased this book to be part of a character education program at a Chiristian pre-school. Imagine my surprise when half way through the book the Queen asks Joseph to go to her bed! I know this event was in the biblical original, but for kids it could have been toned down. It will not be included in our progrom - some parents may not choose to face the questions yet."
3,Famous soloist but...,"When I saw this CD I thought it was a bargain, a famous guitarist playing some of the best guitar concertos with famous orchestras. But the sound quality is mediocre, and the English Chamber Orchestra, usually a great group, plays terribly in Vivaldi's beautiful concerto(Williams leads the orchestra himself in that performance). In any case, I have heard better performances of both Rodrigo and Vivaldi, and unless you are on a really tight budget or a big Williams fan, why not find better recordings, and there are so many great digital ones out there too..."
3,It's an OK Crate,"I purchased this crate for my 5 month old golden doodle puppy. I like the crate overall but unfortunately the door is extremely difficult to close. In order to close the door of the crate, the door mechanism needs to be lifted first while open, after lifting the door up 3 inches or so you need to swing the door closed, then you need to push down the door behind the side brace of the door and after all of that you push the lever across and through the hole. The door on this cage is so difficult to lift up and push down that I had to give it 3 stars. I am not sure if my crate is defective or if it just takes time to work itself loose. Either way, for almost 100 dollars (including shipping), I would expect it to function properly right out of the box."
4,BAD Packaging!,I have used the saw a few times and like it so far. The original packaging from Hitachi is almost nonexistant! There was only cardboard holding it in place. The first saw I sent back the base was cracked and the second one I ordered had the front handle sticking out of the box and was crushed. Also the slide mecanism was loose and the blade jammed into the fence.
1,junk,"Not only is this the ugliest saw I have ever seen it is the most unfriendly to the user. I work professionally in a commercial setting as a finish carpenter. Of the 20 + guys I work with none of them have liked this saw. Big, heavy ridiculous styling. Falls out of square constantly. Nobody uses the digital gauge because it's stupid and pointless. Buy Hitachi's saws and tools that don't look like toys for kids and you'll be money ahead in every facet. I'm embarrassed to use this saw when it shows up on a job-site."
1,too much slop,I played with this saw at my local tool store and I was unimpressed. You can actually move the saw from side to side about 1/4 inch each way with it locked down. It's the worst play of any saw I've ever seen. I do high end trim and stairs and I'm a perfectionist. There is no way to get an accurate cut with this much slop. I would like to see if other Hitachis would do the same. Bigskybob
5,"I have used, abused and used them all again","There is nothing I can not do with this saw. From the time I took it out of the box I was impressed. It does save space over the old bulky Dewalt I had and the cut is as clean as silk. I can not get over the capacity, digital readout ease of user and the accuracy of the laser. We purcahse this and the Makita at the same time. The Makita saw does not come close in terms of accuracy. The radical look of this saw sets it apart in the shop. I would not normally go for this look but I can not get over how good it looks and perfroms in my shop. I have 10 guys per working in the shop using the saw from 7am - 7PM. You could not purchase a better unit. I got the mail in rebate on the finish nailer as well and this was $189 value. I WISH AMAZON would have played this up a little better on thier site. I almost missed it. The value of the saw with the mail in rebate was icing on the cake.The best slide I have every used!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Hitachi was the best, but....","I own 4 hitachi slide mitre boxes 2 10's and 2 8 1/2's. I build furniture and install moulding. We bought this saw for use in our shop but promptly returned it. The laser is ok but not neeeded. The digital display only works to the nearest 1/2 degree and that does not help much for fine tuning cuts. The side to side slop in this saw is real bad, most slides have some but i could not get this saw to cut 1 single straight cut. It moves as far as 3/16 in either direction???? The blade wobbles and it is one heavy heavy saw. This is not acceptable for the percision work I do. The head dosent have enough spring to return to the up position itself. Hitachi spent too much time making this saw look pretty and forgot about accuracy. I will buy another hitachi 10in. I do not reccomend this saw to anyone unless you have a pretty shop where the tools dont get used. Hitachi could not give me this saw I would have to use it as a paper weight."
3,be careful where you buy it,"great saw. its actually my second, after someone made off with my first. got a great price on this one, but have been suspicous that this one is a rebuilt/reconditioned saw. not as smooth as my first, and wont stay in square. I wish this one would dissapear so I could get another one. make sure you get a new one, not a reconditioned one."
3,Costly extras,"The folks at Hitachi seem to have bumped their heads on something hard when they priced crown-stops at $65 a pair plus shipping. Some manufacturers inclued them with the saws others charge about $25. Be careful when ordering, {part #321434 will give you the left side stop and a little vise that you'll never use.} That being said, I can't complain about the accuracy of this tool, regardless of the weight difference with comparable saws."
4,Less than a perfect,"I am extremely pleased with the beautiful clean cuts this saw makes. Everything is so precise it seems to compensate for my lack of expertise in carpentry finish work. I have several rentals and I had a Delta miter saw, and I wanted a 12"" sliding compound miter and after shopping the internet and local box goods stores, the best bang for my buck was this Hitachi from Amazon.com. With rentals to keep costs down I do my own finish work and all that goes with that territory, I couldn't be more pleased than this piece of equipment.One thing which differs from my Delta this cuts to the left of the Laser and my other cut right on the laser line. This is taking me some adjusting, but all things said and done I would highly recommend this saw to anyone that is looking for a Deluxe 12"" Sliding Compound Miter Saw."
1,Seemed to work better without it,I bought this to hopefully make the process of brazing AL easier. This flux seemed to make it harder. If I am wrong it certainly did not make it easier.
4,Good Stained Glass Patterns,The designs and patterns in the book were easy to transcribe into a larger format for actual use in creating stained glass windows. Only a few of the designs had actual color suggestions.
4,Great Pattern Plates,"If you want to make Frank Loyd Wright stained glass windows, this books is a great clear source for the pattern. Originally designed as a coloring book thank could be hung in the window as faux stained glass (silly idea in my opinion) it is good for the patterns. Only drawback is that only a couple of the windows are diagramed in color on the covers, so you won't know what the originals looked like without looking elsewhere. Also, it's a little short at 16 plates, but its also alot cheap at the price."
4,Great source for stained glass!,"I just took my first stained glass class, and I was looking for a pattern book of designs that I actually LIKED, as opposed to the schmaltzy stuff that is so easy to come by. I own a bungalow, and I love Frank Lloyd Wright, so this was perfect for me. It's also fairly easy for beginners, because most of the patterns have only straight lines - no curves.There are only a few colored examples, but if you're familiar with Wright's work, or if you're creative enough to come up with your own colors, this is a great resource! I was just so happy to find this! I really didn't want to spend hours creating unicorns & rainbows!"
3,Moral?,"I must say that I really enjoyed the beautifully etched and delicately colored illustrations of this book. The story was told in a simple language, touched on a historical figure of Hernando de Soto, described the cleverness of both colonies in a way that was easy for the children to understand and was full of very creative ideas such as the flying ship or the melting device. My only concern is that it is a story of 'an eye for an eye' and in the end the River Patrollers are rewarded for something that was not a part of the Ice Festival (their revenge), while the thieves, other than having their sculpture melted are not required to suffer any kind of consequences for their theft, saying 'not that it would ever do any good'. Is this the right way to solve problems? What kind of message are the children supposed to receive? Not one that I would personally support."
5,This one will haunt you...,"Samantha Morton is a excellent actress and this film shows her at her finest! She breaks your heart. Rupert Graves is one of my favorite actors so when I came across this movie several years ago, I was pleased to find another one of his films. After watching, it became one of my favorites, a terribly irresistable bittersweet tale! You shouldn't miss it.I want a DVD!!!!! I've worn out the VHS copy I have. Who do you let know you 'need' a DVD????"
5,One of My All-Time Favorites!,"Bought this years ago, but never reviewed...Absolutley Loved everything about this movie. I thought that the cast was brilliant. Graves and Morton were masterful with their sublety on just how powerful their feelings were for each other. This is a definite recommend for anyone who enjoys a good romance."
4,Liked it!,"I loved the characters in this one, Tippy and Cash were great together. Even though I didn't care for Tippy when I first read about her, I was glad when DP finally wrote them their own story."
1,renegade,"the book was so so boring, i only read the first and last chapters. i think she felt obligated to finish cash story that she worte this garbage. if i read one more virgin story who had it with a thrity something years old guy again i will call for GOD to help me. do not get me wrong i am a fan i have read all her books but i do not think i can read anymore ever again they are too predicatible all of them are. and people are giving it good reviews. trust me do not waist ur money cuz i did mine. read linda howard or karen robard."
3,20s V & 30s EM,"Dislikes:The characters in Ms. Palmer's Jacobsville books appear to all be 20s something year old virgins and 30s+ year old experienced males. Maybe that is how small towns are? I don't know for fact, but in the books, it's getting a bit ""same old - same old"". The first couple of chapters made me want to stop and go to another more interesting book.Likes:I did like how the characters are loyal to each other, whether it's through basic friendship, co-workers, etc. The romance between Cash & Tippy has the typical struggles, and yet they seem to pull through (I'm about of the way through the book). There are times of laughter, tears, romance, mystery, intrigue, etc that make me actually want to finish reading this book.Footnote:I do commend writers for trying to come up with interesting new storylines."
3,From Christabel to Tippy??!!,"I have read and enjoyed many of DP's books and thouroghly enjoyed them. The problem I had with this book is that I read ""Lawless"" before it. Lawless is a wonderfully intense love story that made me love Cash Grier and really feel bad that he didn't ""get the girl"" (Christabel) in the end. Tippy was introduced in this story as a mean, conceited, self centered, spiteful, stuck up brat. There was just no way I could like her after her treatment of Christabel and I don't care that she ruined her designer sweater to help in the end! To me the damage was already done!Cash loved Christabel who's personality is the complete opposite of Tippy so I couldn't believe that Cash could go from her to Tippy. I didn't care about Tippy's sob story and it didn't excuse her behavoir. I thought Cash should deserved better!The bottom line is that if you read ""Lawless"" and hoped for the best for Cash you will be unsatisfied (and maybe even angry!)with these two characters finding love together."
4,I liked this story very much.,"Diana Palmer writes a whole series of books on Jacobsville, Texas. This book is about Cash Grier, the sheriff. Grier is a former merc, black ops and TexasRanger. He does not trust women and very few men. He has had a very rough life. Tippy Moore is a model turned actress and she doesn't trust men. She was sexually assulated as a child and had a very bad childhood. She has a younger brother that she bought from her mother and she is trying to give him a better childhood than what she had. This story is about Cash and Tippy finally learning to trust each other. They had to go through a miscarraige, a kidnapping and Cash's very strong mistrust of models before they get everything worked out.If you believe in equality between the sexes, this is probably not the book of you. Cash is very much the man in charge and she will do what he wants her to do. I was born in the early 40's when this was a very acceptable way of life and I enjoyed the book very much."
3,Good but amazon ripped me off,"I ordered three boxes for my british husbands bday. They called to tell me one box was backordered so I said send the two ou have and cancel the third. They never refunded back my money for the third box, nor did a third box come. I lost the customer rep number so I couldn't call themand I'm only getting an invite to review the product two months later"
5,For Originality,"This is not your quote; ""Rockin Blooz ""Cd . this is a unique look at another side of the blues , the kind that came from Africa . Treanor plays some nifty repro African instruments ,(He is an Ex History Teacher , and knows his subject .. he built his own authentic African instruments for this project ) and combines them well with the dynamite voice of Legendary Ex -Duke /Peacock Texas Soulster Frankie Lee , and some nifty electronic and acoustic percussions. Fans of the Fat Possum sound ,Ali Farka Toure' and N.Miss Hill Country style of blues will enjoy this .Stevie Ray fans will not. This is a powerful original album that points to the future of where blues could be going , nodding at the same time to the African roots of the past.....for the ears of today."
4,almost all of these just can't get enough cds are wonderful!,"this one has quite a few great 80's songs on it! if you were or still are into this music scene try to check out all volumes!!! there will be songs you haven't heard in years on them (some great & some not so great,but that's just my opinion)!"
3,Some great stuff some not so great,"I was exited when I first saw this video in the library, after seeing so many great male voice choirs in Wales. Unfortuanately the video was'nt great, there was some rousing Welsh songs sung of the video, but mostly the choice of music was poor and not really suited to the choir, which was disapointing.It is still worth purchasing for the 3 or 4 good songs, but dont's expect to much from the rest, and don't judge male voice choirs in general on this video."
5,Wonderful mix of talent,We have thoroughly enjoyed this CD and play it often while travelling. It is very upbeat and the tempo gets you going. Would definitely suggest that you purchase this CD...to be enjoyed by those in my age category (50+) for sure!
5,Best filter around,"Not much to say about this filter. B+W makes the best filters hands down. They cost a pretty penny, but I'm not about to put a $15 filter in front of a $2,000 lens. Slim filters should be used on wide angle lenses to avoid vignetting around the edges. Only downside about slim filters is that lens caps do not work because the filter itself is too thin. This filter does come with an end cap to cover the filter. It's not great, but it does the job."
3,Thin but maybe too much!,Good product but so thin that the regular Canon cap won't hold on top of the filter. The B+W cap provided with the filter doesn't stick in place and is falling constantly
3,Can't use stock lens cap,"Seemed like a good quality item, but the lip on it is not big enough for my stock Canon clip on lens cap to grab. But I guess that's what they mean by slim. I returned it. Wanted to use my stock cap."
3,Very annoying cap... need to jerry-rig something to protect this filter...,"I use this high-quality (expensive) filter on a Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8 L lens. Everything is great except the annoyance of (1) the Canon factor lens cap will not work since this filter is so thin (needed to avoid vignetting), and (2) the cap that comes with this filter does not stay on the filter. Some may whine that these are complaints about the cap and not the filter... true... however I am now spending time figuring out how to protect my investment in this filter since the cap that comes with it is inferior. If anyone has found a solution to this specific filter I would appreciate learning what worked for you."
4,care baer cubs,i would like a care baer cub because the thing aburtising it was making me wont 1or2!
1,original was better,i had the original release.. and dont know what the hell this 2006 version is.. does dave really think people wanted to hear him ruin the lyrics.. get over yourself dave.. it was a side project.. now it just sounds like another new megadeth album.. dont get me wrong.. i am a big megadeth fan.. i just think this new release is an insult to the original.. i wouldnt waste my money on this new version..
1,Where's Lee Ving?,"I bought this [REMASTERED] disc to replace a lost original. I *was* excited about the ""bonus"" tracks, but it's all usless noise now. They completely trashed what WAS a nice CD. I wish I could return it as garbage! I'm just glad that I bought it cheap at Amazon instead of expensive at a record store! This just makes me sick. I miss the original so much more now! russwill"
1,"I ""lost"" the original vocal track","Boy, for a born-again Christian, I think Dave's being a little dishonest here. He ""lost"" the original vocal track? Please be honest. Dude, if you wanted to re-record it with yourself singing, just say so. Don't lie."
2,"Thin gruel for the experienced, a brief overview for others","I've been reading and researching low-cost homesteading for about a year now, so I was very excited to come across this title and see what else I could learn from a first-person success story.Sadly, the answer was not much and what *was there* wasn't terribly detailed. There are other, better books that will leave you prepared to act upon the ideas David Cook only touches upon.The first that comes to mind is Rob Roy's ""Mortgage-Free"". Ironically, a reviewer for that book thought it wasn't detailed enough. Apparently, they hadn't read this book first.The truth is that no one book can prepare and educate you for the experience of ""getting back to the land"". But, while we're on the subject of land, I'd recommend Les and Carol Scher's ""Finding and Buying Your Place in the Country""."
1,The title is misleading,"Real Estate Investing yes, Dream Home noThe book focuses on how to make money in real esate investment by building and selling homes. Few of the suggestions appear practical for someone who works at a 9-5 job. Also, both the home design software programs recommended in the book received very negative reviews on Amazon. The book is pitched toward someone who likes to work a deal, not a potential homebuilder with a dream."
4,Cult Classic,"I had not heard of this book until I finished reading the Howard the Duck Omnibus. I loved that book so much that I looked into other Gerber books. And found this gem. Though not as good as Howard the Duck, Omega the Unknown is fine example of what made Steve Gerber's works truely shine, characters. The characters in this book seem more down to earth and real than most comics of the time. The book is a great read and pretty affordable. If you like a book with a few surprise twists and good solid characters this is the book for you."
2,expensive,"I heard this series is actually quite good, but I'll wait until a more affordable version comes out(an Essential version ?)This 'softcover' book is about 50 dollars Canadian if you buy it at a shop. Frankly, with only 12 issues collected here that's a bit much. Where does Marvel come up with these prices?Unless your a hardcore fan (or very rich) I can't really recommend this book."
2,"great trike, when working","My daughter got this tricycle as a gift. It was great- even though the handle doesn't help turn the bike, my 2 year old was really enjoying it. After less than 6 months of use however,the wheel fell off the bike. I've heard it's nearly impossible to find this part and essentially IT is non-existent.I don't have the owners manual and I haven't been able to use the bike since. It just sits in our garage gathering up dust. I'll probably donate it just to get it out of our garage. maybe a mechanic can make a part for it."
2,Tips easily,"I asked my sister to buy this bike for my daughter for xmas last year - she decided to buy another one for my nephew also since he is the same age as my daughter (2 yrs old at the time). She bought the two bikes at the same time, same model, same color, same store. My daughter, who is far more coordinated then my nephew, tips over very easy, my nephew seems to do fine. My daughter is taller and that may be where the difference lies. Perhaps the height of the child using the trike is what is causing the trike to tip easily. Not sure - but I know I regret that she ever got the bike -it was a total waste of money.Update: I was recently at a playdate and every kid who tried using this bike was tipping over and getting hurt."
1,yikes!,THIS WAS HORRIBLE! Our little girl tipped over EVERY time she turned the handle bar while in motion! I can't even give this wreck of a tricycle to Goodwill -- it's going in the trash. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DANGEROUS TOY!
1,C's Mommmy,"I have to agree with the others. This trike is a hazard. I bought it for my 4 year old when she was 2. It tipped whenever she tried to make a left or right turn. She hated it, and in the back of the garage it went.My husband tried to take it out for our younger daughter, who is 2years old and much more physically advanced for her age,to see if she could handle it. The same thing happened.Fortunately, her helmet took the brunt of the fall. The trike is going in the trash. I will not even sell it at a yard sale, as someone else suggested. How can someone knowingly sell something they think is too dangerous for her own kid???"
1,NOT STURDY,"I bought two of these trikes for my 19 month old twin sons. Within the first 10 minutes of use, they both tipped over numerous times. They tipped over when they were trying to use the pedals and also when they were just using their feet on the floor. Definitely not a sturdy trike. My husband and I were very disappointed and returned them immediately.In reading other reviews, I see that our experience with these trikes is not unique."
1,"Tipped over 4 times in short ride, under normal conditions","This is a very cute tricycle at an okay price but unsafe. My daughter rode this 1 time down the sidewalk only a few houses and tipped over 4 times. the first when she slowly turned right out of the drive. the 2nd two was when she was riding it relatively staight, the last was while she was quietly sitting on it but not moving. She will have nothing to do with this bike now and I don't blame her.After the fact I did notice that the rear wheels on this tryke are significantly closer together than some other tricycles, which is likely the cause for such instability.To summarize, toddlers injuring themselves repeatedly on the same ride is no fun for anyone."
1,Should be recalled,This trike tips over no matter the size of the child. Totally unsafe especially around turns. It should be recalled and redesigned with a wider base.
1,I wouldn't buy after trying it,"I've been looking for a good, safe trike for my almost-2-year-old and I've seen this one in a few stores. My daughter likes the look of it, but after trying it in the store, I will be steering away from this model. Of the two times I let my daughter sit on it, she tipped it over both times. No joke. The first time she tipped it with both feet on the floor by simply turning the wheel (not jerking) and the second time she had her feet on the pedals and jerked the wheel with her feet pressing down. This trike is not sturdy enough for the age group its recommended. It's cute with a nice design and bucket, but cosmetic value does not beat safty by any means."
1,Buy Band Aids,Where are the red turkeys for things that are dangerous? This thing was Designed by an idiot that never rode a bike. There is No rake to the small front wheel. Kids go over the damn handlebars. The designer should be sued.
1,SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET,I bought this for my 2 year old and am so disappointed with everything about it. Every time she gets on or off it it tips over. If she tries to turn it tips over. A neighbor girl tried it as well and it tipped with her also. This is an unsafe bike that should be off the market.
2,nOT for a tall child,"My son has recently turned 3yrs old and i bought this toy with the idea that it would be a great transition vehicle for him to go to the bicycle. i dont know who they found that can ride this toy at 5ys old but it definitely was not for anyone tall for their age. The handlebars r just too close to the seat so it creates an uneven distribution of weight but most importantly the knees are too close to the handlebars. The handlebars are also hard to steer. He had to continuously pick up the trike and point it in the direction he wanted it to go. My son is 38inches tall. IF YOUR CHILD IS OVER 38inches, DO NOT BUY THIS TOY AND SAVE YOURSELF SOME DISAPPOINTMENT."
1,Not for an active child!!,This is one of two Tricycles my daughter has. After tipping and falling off several times this is now limited to only indoor over carpet use. She does wear a helmet so thank goodness we did have any bumps on her head but I didn't think that she would need elbow and knee pads as well as a face mask!! This is unsafe for a child who is very active.
2,not safe,I bought one at Target - my daughter was very excited and eager to jump on. Right after she sat on it and move foward it tipped right a way. We returned it in 5 minutes.
1,Tip Over So Easily,"I was so impressed with the color and cute look at first but regret so much for buying it because it tips over so easily. If I have another chance, I would look for something that is more balance, wide and low. I will give this toy away soon."
2,Tipsy,"Bought this for our son when he was 18 months old. He's a very physical child and picked up on peddling quite quickly. By 2 yrs old this trike became unsafe. He was going so fast that this trike would constantly tip around corners. Not due to my sons steering but the trike being so ""light in the pants"". We bought him a 12 inch big boy bike just after his second birthday and he is much safer on that than on this trike."
2,Tips over easily,"I agree with the other reviewers that although this bike is very cute and adorable, it tips over extremely easily. We tried it out at Toys R Us, my son tipped over at least 4 times even when he's not moving! As much as we want to purchase the bike, I think I would want to find something more stable."
1,Lawsuit waiting to happen,"I absolutely wanted to love this trike. It's cute, colorful, and the perfect size for my 20-month old son. So, we saw them at the store today and decided to try one out. Well, the thing tipped when he tried to get on it. No biggie, I thought, he must have pulled it over. So, I held it while he got on. He started pedalling, turned the wheel to the left, and the thing flipped right onto its side - my poor little boy hit his face on the shelf at Toys'r'us. Whoever thinks this bike is safe must NOT be reviewing the Fold-2-Go model - this one's a tipping hazard for sure and should be taken off the market before some child really gets hurt."
1,It Does Tip Easily.,"My husband and I went to the local Toysrus store to see which side of the mixed reviews is right. This is a cute tricycle for sure. When we were looking at it in the store, an employee aproached us and said, ""I wouldn't recommend you that. Unfortunately, it tips easily."" I pushed one side of the handle down, and it did tip SO easily. The employee went on and said, ""I'm a mother, too. I can't recommend something I wouldn't buy for my own children."" She showed us another trike, which was around $60, if I remember right. This was MUCH stabler than the Fold-2-Go, and didn't move a bit even when I pushed one side hard enough in the attempt to make it tip. We didn't make any purchase that day after all, but we sure appreciated the honesty and kindness of the store clerk."
1,HAZARD To Your Child's Knees (& other body parts),"This trike should be recalled immediately. I can't believe that the manufacturers can market a product that is so obviously faulty. My child tipped over, not just sideways but head first, at least 5 times within the first 30 minutes that he had the trike. I was so disappointed because we were so excited about giving it to him. The size seemed perfect and we thought he would be able to pedal. He couldn't even ride with his feet on the ground and pushing, because he still tipped over. BIG THUMBS DOWN FROM OUR FAMILY. NO ONE SHOULD PURCHASE THIS TRIKE IF THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO PICK THEIR CHILD UP FROM THE GROUND CONSTANTLY."
1,Do not buy this trike,"I bought this trike for my son at Target. He saw it and fell in love with it. He has another trike and is able to ride that one with ease. Don't be fooled by the handiness of being able to fold it up, and the cute look of this trike. Anytime my son was pedaling and turning the handle bars at the same time, the trike tipped over--sending him flying to the ground. There's something about the construction that is defective. He fell off of it at least five times within the first 10 minutes. I took it back the same day. I think this is a dangerous trike and it should be recalled. If you are thinking this is a cheap alternative to a Kettler trike--think again."
1,Dangerous!,I bought this bike for our 2 year old son. Both of our young children have tipped over on this trike so many times! The wheel base does not seem wide enough to be stable. My son sported a nice bruise on his chin after one of his falls. The Kettler my daughter has is so much safer and now we've ordered one for my son to replace the Radio Flyer.
2,Tips over too easily,"We have had this trike for a couple of years and my daughter has never really liked it. Once she was big enough to use the pedals (instead of her feet) the front wheel is not real rubber and so slides instead of getting traction. My daughter continues to get frustrated with it. Another big issue is how easily she can flip over on it. Once she does start getting some speed using the pedals, if she turns too quickly it flips thus causes a hurt knee or again just pure frustration. We have enjoyed the My First Scooter from Radio Flyer. I am going to try to find something that sits lower to the ground so she can pedal with speed and confidence that she won't flip over. Wouldn't buy again or for anyone else."
2,Safety Hazard.,"My son received this for his 2nd birthday from his grandparents. He has another trike, but they thought the fold 2 go feature would be convenient. He has no problems pedaling either of the tricycles he has, but this one seems to slide and tip over easily when he tries to turn, either indoors or out. I think it has a lot to do with the hard plastic wheels that, in my opinion, should be rubber, or at least rubber coated. I've contacted Radio Flyer regarding this tricycle, and am waiting to hear back from them for a possible refund."
2,Tips over too easily,"I got this for my 15 month old for Christmas. She is not yet big enough for it but my 3 year old has been trying it out. It tips over way too easily. She fell off 4 times in one riding session. I think I may bring it back for something more stable. When my younger one is big enough to ride I think it will be too unsafe for her. Good price for a first trike, but you get what you pay for. Very disappointed in such a good brand."
3,Tips easily. Kiddio is best.,"My son loves the trike and especially the basket in back to carry his stuff, but I don't like it because it tips very easily if he picks up any speed. We've had many a fall on this trike. Kiddio, while expensive, has a much wider wheel base and our Kiddio trike never tips."
2,Yard sale here we come.,"My son doesn't like this at all. He never did, we have had it for about two years and I kept thinking that he will be ready for it soon, he tipped once and didn't every want to ride it again. Now he has out grown it, fortunatly it is in such great shaped (from lack of use) that it will sell well at a yard sale."
2,tips over too easily!!!!,"This trike is very cute and easy to ride, but is too easy to tip over. I haven't tried out any others to compare it to, but my child is now scared to ride it b/c it tips over anytime she is going remotely fast and turns the wheel. She is 3 and hasn't had another that she can ride well, so it may be her inexperience combined with the light weight frame, but it scares me. I don't normally write reviews so take this seriously."
1,So disappointed in this toy,"So dangerous, so disappointing - tips over so easily. Thought we could trust this toy. I am taking it back ASAP. Don't buy this trike!"
2,Tire Splits- Even with Inside Use!,"I came here to see if I could find a new front tire for this trike. I thought it was our large 2 year old (39"" tall and 38Lbs) that made the tire split into two pieces. He rides it a lot, but only inside. After seeing all the other reviews that state the same problem , I guess it's the tire not the tot. So, I won't bother trying to find another one. this is an expensive little trike to be so poorly made. I feel sorry my Mom spent so much on it for him. Oh, well. We found a hotwheels motorcyle trike that was much cheaper, built better, and should last him till he's 60 pounds- Which at this rate will be in a few months!"
2,This is a dangerous bike!,"I agree with many of the other reviewers that this bike tips over very easily. My son does know how to pedal a bike, and yet this tips without any warning. He has gotten caught underneath the bike, and had the handlebars turn so that he needed help to get the bike off of him so he could get up. The only positive aspects are that we store ours outside and it has held up well, also, my son was able to reach the pedals before he turned 2 (he is a lttle under the 50% for height) so he was able to learn to pedal on this bike. As a side note, the 2 most positive reviews for this bike are over 18 months old, I think it is quite possible they have a different model than what is currently available."
1,Dangerous bike,We bought this bike for our 15 month old and when he tried to get on it kept tipping over. We were going to put it away thinking he was too young for it. Well our 3 year old got on and was just riding it normally and he went around a corner and it tipped on over. Took bike back immediately. We are very disappointed in Radio Flyer. Love your wagon...hate your tricycles.
2,radio flyer should provide replacement!,"I bought this for my 2year old grandson and I am very sorry I chose this one! The trike tips over constantly, he won't ride it because of this. My 2 year old nephew and a few other children has tried to ride it aswell and it tips with too. I put it up, thinking about putting it in the garbage. This trike was not cheap in price but it's designe is all wrong. Sad that this is my grandson's first trike and it has made him a little discouraged to get on riding toys.Radio Flyer Fold 2 Go Trikeshould be recalled and radio should offer a nice replacement."
2,I should have listened to everyone else...,"I really should have believed the other one and two stars reviews. This trike tips over very easily. It is cute and my son liked riding it for the couple of days we had it, but I could not believe how many times it tipped when he tried to turn. We returned it and ended up buying the Schwinn roadster."
2,"folds up, but tips easily","For careful riders this tricycle is fine. It folds up nicely to hang up in the garage when not in use. HOWEVER, if you have a little one who likes to turn (at all) then expect it to tip. Older toddlers can catch themselves, but the littlest ones just tip and land hard."
2,poor design,"If i had to do it all over again, i would not have purchased this trike now knowing what i know. It really is a very poor design. Unlike most 3 wheelers, the rider sits right over the front handlebars, making it very unstable. Most 3 wheelers, have slightly extended front forks, which adds to a better center of gravity. On this 3 wheeler, anytime my grandson would lean the slightest bit forward, the trike would tumble forward. He hit his head on the floor once. I really wouldnt recommend this to anyone."
1,Flip out,I flipped out with this very small book - not at all what I expected and way overpriced. The original book was a treat for the eyes - not a second rate fuzzy copy.
3,Mediocre at best,"I've had this for a month now and have been experiencing some bugs. When I try to select a song in a folder, sometimes the settings don't take the first time around and have to redo. Also, sometimes the folders simply don't show on the screen when I try to make a selection. I have to turn it off and back on. I've also experienced the device turning off by itself with a new battery for no apparent reason (even with the lock on).Other than the occasional bug, it's pretty ok. You simply get what you paid for on this one (and maybe a little less)."
2,Hard To Handle,The idea and size of the SanDisk is great but the control toggle is just to small. When trying to scroll through songs I would skip to the radio or another folder. The sound quality was great and creating folders and transfering music was easy. Although the files did not always transfer in the order of the playlist. I returned and guess I will have to save up for an Ipod.
2,Was AWESOME and then volume went out!!!!!!!!,I loved loved loved my mp3 player. I mainly used it when jogging at the gym. Had it for 9 months and now the volume is going out. Swapped headphones out several times and still bad. Very disappointed!!! :(
5,Awsome MP3 Player,"I got my sandisk 512MB mp3 player yesterday, and it rocks. The sound quality is great and putting songs on the player is easy. But i got the thing about 8 days later that it should have come because it got delayed. My friend's mom got a book from amazon, and it also was delayed, so if you are need it to deliver on the shipping days it says, you might consider buyin it somewhere else. If not, amazon has a great price for it."
4,bestbuy,"as my personal preference, I wanted to get the ipod photo, but i just couldnt spend that much money on it. So decided to get non-ipod mp3 player. I just got mine today, and I'm pretty happy with my choice. it has the screen to see what's playing, can play the FM radio, record the voice. ipod shuffle does not have this features. the armband-it's adjustable to any sizes of arms. i dont have to download the iTunes-simply just copy and paste music files as if copying files to another drive. I'm not too crazy about the case, it's not the best but it would do."
4,Very nice little Digical Audio Player plays mp3 and wma,I am surprise by how good the sound is with this unit. I bought the 512mb version but I think it is the same for other sizes. It is VERY easy to load songs into this unit. plug the USB2 cable in and drag and drop! Only problem is the ear plugs are too darn big and hurt my ears. I sub that with my own Quiet earhead phones in order to get comfortable but the sound seems get depressed and not as loud.
4,Important workaround for scrolling issue,"Evidently, the player scrolls the MP3 filename (with occasional popping sound) if the ID3v2 fields are unavailable. Setting those fields seems to help quite a bit. I have had success using Winamp to set the ID3v1 and ID3v2 fields on my MP3 files. Now if only I could get the player to remember its saved settings. Every time I power it up, it goes back to default values."
1,Baffling,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas. It's May, and we still haven't figured out how to use it."
2,No joy in that joystick,"The sound quality is fine and the ease of downloading tracks is very good. BUT, the steps required for navigating the different features were numerous and hard to remember. No problem, there's the instruction booklet-not! The worst documentation I can remember for any electronic appliance I have purchased. There were many symbols and choices that I had no idea what they meant or did.Last, the joystick became off-center. This rendered its responses less predictable than would be expected. For example, it would advance the tracks upon pressing when I intended to select the one ready for playing.After 2 weeks of confusion, I returned it and upgraded to Zen Nano Plus - to be continued."
4,Much better than I expected,"I just got this for a few hours and I am extremely happy with it.After reading so many reviews, I actually had low expectation.(I tend to focus on negative reviews to see if a product should be avoided)However, it performs flawlessly. The music match software isoptional. You can copy the mp3 files directly to the device asif it is a hard drive. Or through music match.One negative thing which might be true is the interface. Ittook me a while to get a control of the device. It is not toouser friendly.After all, I am excited. And I wish I ordered the 1G versionbecause 512MB is really not enough."
4,Great Little MP3,"I REALLY like this MP3 player. I just wanted one for my workouts, so I didn't need one that would hold my entire cd collection, and this is perfect. I didn't bother with the software that came with it (it was already on my laptop anyway). Just use the usb cable included, plug it in to your computer, copy your cd using windows media player, and paste it onto the mp3 player. It's that easy. I haven't tried with downloaded music (don't care).There are only two things I would like improved. The menu is a bit tricky to navigate. It tells you how in the manual, but it's still funky. Also, the headphones, while good sound, the cord is too short for the left ear, too long for the right. But you can always buy different ones.I would highly recommend this little player."
3,Good little workout partner.,"Good little player for the gym, compact enough with arm band to wear while lifting serious weight as well as doing cardio.Wish it went louder to hear over the gym house music and other commotion. If known before would have purchased one with more memory that 512mb.Stores about 10 different artists, with 10 songs per artist. (rough estimate on song length and such).Need more space, because the music I listen to to workout is not the same as what I listen to to relax -- DUH!!! obvious one, so if you are looking for a big selection, go with greater memory."
2,Worked well... for about a month,"Initially I was pleased with the SanDisk 512mb; earphones weren't very good, but with the money saved, could get a better pair. Eats a AAA battery up faster than the manufacturer claims.Unfortunately, the device doesn't seem built to last - within two months of use, sound output to one channel cut out. At first thought it was a problem with the earphones - but it wasn't - same loss of sound in the left side with 3 different sets of phones (including the ones that came with it). It was nice while it lasted..."
2,Its great until it quits working!,"This thing is sensitive. Ive had it for a couple of months and first I had to order a complete replacement for it because it worked for about 5 minutes then it died and simply WOULD NOT function anymore.Then, the replacement unit worked for 6-7 weeks and it too has died. Ive tried replacing the battery several times and it just won't turn on. Ive wasted my money. If you're going to buy this, I would suggest also buying the replacement warranty because you'll need it!The few weeks of use I got out of it were good though. The recorder worked well in class."
2,Promising but not quite,"I received this as a gift last year. I primarily use it for running and, since it's small and lightweight, it works well for this. Except... it is very ""glitchy."" If I'm in voice record mode and want to go into MP3 listening mode, it locks up and I have to remove the battery and replace to reset it. Actually, when going from radio mode to MP3 it sometimes locks up also. I contacted Sandisk customer service and they were of no help. Suggested I take it back and get a replacement. Well, I did this twice and all three units did the same thing, which tells me that Sandisk has a design issue. As long as you just want to listen to music and don't want the voice functions and radio, it will work fine but just beware that it may lock up on you and then you'll have to remove the battery to reset.Speaking of battery, it's terrible. It takes one AAA and I might get 4-5 1-hour running sessions in before I need to replace it.I'd look elsewhere personally."
1,Don't buy this piece of crap!!!,"This device does not work. Could not put in a single mp3 that I downloaded into the device. The file would report as copied, but after I disconnected from the usb port, it shows 0 files downloaded!!! After trying this a few times, it finally locked up for good! Very frustrating and confusing!!! I am returning and getting the IPod instead."
1,Dont Buy this!!!!!,I hate this and it is really confussing and it freezes all of the time. Swithc the mode from music to radio to recorder is almost impossible. Half the time the tilt wheel works backwards and sometime the song title shows up in another langueage. Do yourself a favor and buy the Ipod Shuffle instead.
3,Much larger than I expected,"This is not meant to be a full review. I considered this player when also considering some of the Muvo series, and when I went to look at all of them in person, I was quite surprised at how much larger this player is than I expected. This may not be an issue for you, but I work out and wanted it on an arm band, and the Sandisk would have been too bulky."
3,luv da color but prefer the one gig cap of da silver san-disk,FIRST QUESTION:does this have a REMOVABLE memory card (so that I can build up)?SECOND QUESTION:does this (512MB blue SanDisk) have the ability to RECORD radio?THIRD QUESTION:is this product suitable for a guy like me to bang around & sweat[...]
4,A ask for all!,"Can I use the SanDisk like a pendrive too ??? or like memory card, that can I put some files like .doc???Thanks a lot fo all"
1,Piece of expensive crap!!,"This mp3 is total junk!! I got it as an early Christmas present and was psyched since my husband had just gotten the Sandisk 1gb. I saw how easy it was for him to download blah blah blah. Well unfortunately mine turned out to be crap. It would start to download about 3 songs and then a window would pop up saying I had to insert a disk in drive E. I would have to unplug and replug to get it to do something. Finally, after about 2 hours it only downloaded 4 songs. We thought there HAD to be something wrong with this one so we took it back and got a 2nd one. Same old thing happened. Customer support was useless because they were closed. The user manual on the one sheet of paper and the manual on the disk were completely useless. We finally got fed up and took the worthless piece of junk back to Best Buy. I went over to Circuit City and bought the RCA LYRA 256mb. I am so happy with my new mp3. BUYER BEWARE, STAY AWAY!!"
4,"I bought it only because I need a MP3 now,,,","6/16/05 update:I still insist this is a good MP3 except the price. I just asked my coworker to buy the Creative N200 1 GB MP3 cost $120 at Fry's.Although I like this MP3, I still think the price is too high. Amazon mark up five dollars more and w/o free shipping after I purchased this item, so I won't recommend this to anyone.Pro:1.Compact and light weight2. Sound quality is good (subjective, and I use my own $30 Sony headphone which bought 4 years ago)3. Easy to figure out the buttons and the menu4. Can display foreign lanugages song names5. Not power hungry.Con:1. Price -- should worth $70 only. Period.2. Hope it provide a clip instead of waist band.Others:1. For the battary compartment you need to look at the quick start guide first, otherwise don't feel sorry if you break it.2. Download the latest firmware from Sandisk website to fix the voice recorder problem."
2,Lots of bugs,"I've had this player for about 6 weeks. The controls are abysmal. The player freezes up when trying to switch from radio mode to mp3 mode. I have to remove the battery to un-freeze it. Oddly enough, I've noticed quite a few positive reviews for this player wherein the author actually noted the freeze-ups and yet still gave it a good review. ???The biggest nuisance is that when I put songs into the player, I have no idea how many are actually going to play. This morning I loaded about 50 songs on the drive. The player recognized 13 of them. Worse yet, several of the 13 songs weren't even songs that I had loaded. These songs had been deleted a few days ago. When I scan the drive with my computer, these ghost songs aren't even there, but yet they continue to play. All of these glitches have been there since day 1. I would not recommend this item. Even at $17, this player isn't worth it.Andrew"
3,Psychopathic thriller of demented ravings?,"A rapist and a killer with a dual personality meet in a restaurant and discuss God, evil and punishment. Logic is misused by one to ""prove"" that you can do anything that you want, because God if he existed wouldn't allow evil.Part of the film is in black and white, to point outthe kind of actions or thought involved?The acting is pretty good, but the blood and mayhem isjust not a new thing. It is perverting science and logic to makethese kinds of arguments about God and eviland call it an art film? I think the God of love and punishmentargument is just as disloyal to theology?As well meaning as the producers of this film may be,I think a Taoism point of view that certainlaws of behavior are universal might be better?"
4,Helpful hints for preparing for interview,"This book is an excellent resource. A must read during the application process. It contains great helpful hints on preparing for your interviews, filling out applications, and writing your application essays. I would also advise you to attend one of his day long seminars if he's still conducting them."
1,Not for the experienced applicant,This book is fairly elementary and not very usefull to any one who has done any other reading about the application process for medical or physicians assitant schools.
5,Best of the Series!,"Unlike the other CDs in this series, every cut is a gem! Well known classics like ""Cars"", ""Private Idaho"" and ""Teacher, Teacher"" are combined with less well known (at least to me) equally great songs like ""88 Lines"", ""Stool Pigeon"" and especially ""I Live in the City"". I own vol 1-7 and 13; this is the best!"
5,More memory then I know what to do with.,"This card is great. So much space on it. Right now I'm filling it with pictures, keeping a digital album on my phone. Still plenty of room for anything else though. It's nice to have a resume on hand in case I need to e-mail it or beam it to someone."
2,Maybe its was the logitech bluetooth headset?,"After owning the memory card for about a week, I tried to beem a picture and some other files to my brothers Logitech bluetooth headset and phone but once connected, my MDA prompted me with an error message about the connected device not working properly when I tried to get into my files. I disconnected the bluetooth connections, turned the phone off and then turned it back on and the memory card was no longer recognized by my MDA. A T-mobile tech told me it was a defective memory card or it may have been the bluetooth headset I was connected to. Idk but I wont be beeming anymore files through bluetooth if I can loose 1GB worth of information. Luckily amazon agreed to replace it. But they are late on the approx. shipping dates as of now :("
5,Good for the money,Although I now wished that I had purchased a 2GB or more memory I am still happy with the product that I got. I had absolutely no problems with formatting. I am glad that I purchased the adapter with the mini SD card. My phone service was in error when they informed me that the Treo700 used it. It actually uses the regular SD Card.
5,works great in my device,"I had problems with micro cards using a mini adapter, but this mini card works well in my Janam handheld data recorder."
2,Great Product,I use the 1GB miniSD Card for my PPC 6700 Pocket PC. It works great and has not caused any problems. The price I paid was great and there are no other better deals out there.GREAT!!!!
1,Too much delay in deliverables,I have not received the item even after more than one month after the purchase of the item. I never expected this much delay from the Amazon. I may not be able to purchase again from Amazon unless there is drastic improvement in the deliverables and unless compensated for this delay.
4,Works great with Verizon Phone,I bought this to listen to Music with my LG Verizon phone and it works great.
4,Great product,"This is a great product. In keeping with the tradition of all other Sandisk products, its performance is great!"
1,Scan disk mini Sd,it did not work at all and Amazon would not take it back saying it was my responsibility that it did not work. I would never buy this or any other product from this seller.
1,WRONG ITEM!,I ordered a 1 GB miniSD card. The item that I received does not match what I ordered. I did not receive a 1GB miniSD card. I will not use Amazon again. I've never had this problem with Ebay!
3,Very FRAGILE,I broke 2 of these the first time in installed them in my phone. They get hairline cracks very easily so be very gentle when installing (duh).
5,1GB miniSD memory card,The memory card came very quickly and works perfectly for my cell phone and digital camera!
2,Good product but wrong size,"I bought this to go in my new phone, well after I purchased it I realized I bought the wrong one and within a hour of placing my order I contacted the seller to cancel the order so that I could get the one I really needed. Well I received no response and then got a email conformation 2 days later saying that my order had been shipped. I contacted the selling asking for a full refund seeing as I had requested my order to be canceled. They said that they responded ""in a timely manner"" and did not feel the need to refund me for the full price. It would have cost more to ship it back to them than what the item actually cost me. Be careful with what you order with them because they charge both arms and a leg and a half for shipping."
3,For Cannon Vixia HV30,"The Cannon Camcorder requires one of these to take still pictures. The ""mini SD"" form factor is hard to find and may become obsolete. Most places sell the ""MicroSD"" . This smaller SD card will not work in the camera, even with an adapter that makes it fit."
3,"WOW! Was ""Mickey"" a GREAT song, or what?!","Nope, in fact it was one of the songs that I hated the first time I heard it and can still gather up a load of revulsion for today. The oddball tune that drags this collection up to the .500 line is Pete Shelley's ""Homo Sapien"". Funny, catchy and just plain clever, but I worry about Pete. Other than that volume 5 barely trips the meter. Welcome to the middle of the new wave road."
4,Just what I was looking for!,Labels were just what I was looking for. I was wondering how I would know which keys to apply the labels to but when they arrived they were laid out on a sheet that mimicked my key board so finding the correct spot for them was easy.
3,Good staff!,"It's perfect for the smaller size of keyboard like desktop keyboard. Not so good for the laptop, which was the reason I purchased it."
3,Not bad at all :),"Stickers for the number line with signs is messed up. Oh well, there is no all stickers for all signs like brackets, ! mark, etc. Very limited. Stickers for comma and period are together in one. Overall, I am happy."
4,Not your typical PHJB,"Even though there are some ""New Kids on the Block"" this is still great New Orleans jazz. The Humphrey brothers are missing on a few of the cuts, but they have a strong ""bench"". Dr. Michael White on clarinet and Wendell Brunious on trumpet fill in nicely. 7 minutes and 29 seconds of ""Somebody Else Is Taking My Place"" will lend new meaning to that old Fox Trot, and If you can't dance to this one, you're dead. ""Put On Your Old Bonnet""--Excellent, as is ""Lily Of The Valley"". Ten cuts, all great. If this is your first PHJB, it won't be your last."
5,Rock On Momma,"I don't know what the complaining is about; all artists evolve and evolution means having the guts to get out in front of people while trying new things. I love Susan's sound and it's really good to hear a woman wailing the blues so melodically.When I am having a bad-guitar day and feel like pulling a Pete Townsend all over my bedroom, I remember Jonny Lang's words (Frontline; winter 99), Susan, are you listening?...""Don't let anyone else but you tell you what's right....it's easy to let other people's comments influence you.....remember, you are the only person that matters."" Thanks Jonny, you're a doll. Rock on momma!"
4,"Not a bad start, at all.","I borrowed this album off a friend, and I found it to be far superior to ""Just won't burn""; which is not a bad album, just a tad polite. This one has more of a spark. The vocals are definitely her best quality; the guitar work might need a little work, but then again you'll only notice if you're a guitar player (read wanker, zealot or terrorist), otherwise it does what it's supposed to: support her stellar voice."
4,moves my soul,It is really great to hear a woman sing and play the blues as Susan does.She is todays Janis Joplin!!!!!!!
3,"Rerelease of a ""Local"" CD poor quality recording--Good music","This CD was originally a ""regional"" CD back in 1997. The Sessions were acquired and rereleased on this current issue. So, it's not very good quality recording, mix, etc. If you like blues, this is good early work by Susan, but a CD best left to her avid fans. All the later CDs are regular comercial quality or better and Susan improves with age, boton guitar and singing. It's so easy to sample stuff these days free, you can listen and decide if you like it; don't let the ""blues snobs"" steer you away from Tedeschi; you might miss out on a lot of heart and a lot of fun."
4,Susan's passion is an inspiration to all aspiring musicians,This is a great album. Both of her albums are fantastic and pale only to the intensity that she conveys live. I have seen her perform several times and waiting anxiously for next opportunity !!!!!
3,Why buy the copy when the original is still available?,What's all the hype? She sounds just like Bonnie Raitt. Reminds me of when Tracy Chapman made a splash a few years back. I thought I was listening to Joan Armatrading. There are far more deserving artists who have their own sound who need exposure.
2,"it doesn't feel real,she's trying to hard.","she has a beautiful voice,but,I think she ought to try a different venue.I hear a strain in voice,when she tries to get to bluesy."
1,Other Tongues Other Flesh,"This book is poorly written and poorly edited. The author has some interesting perspectives and speculations but does not cite a single reliable source to back up any of it. I believe a lot of what he says can be easily discredited by some simple fact checking. I enjoy reading about alternate perspectives of our world however, I cannot get into this book because of the numerous grammatical errors and complete lack of reliability or narrative flow."
3,Not The Developer's Edition,"I returned this book today. I'd hoped that it would be similar to Marco Tabini's ""Professional Site Server 3.0 Commerce Edition"", which was loaded with examples, code, and how-to's. This book is not for the developer who will be building CS2000 web sites and needs to get up and running with the ASP code, site logic & code encapsulation used by CS2000. There are only a few snippets of code here and there and they relate to SQL server & BizTalk. This book does provide an good overview of the many features of CS2000, with some depth & explanation on a number of it's features. This book would probably be very useful to IT manager at a midsize to large company who is evaluating various e-comm solutions."
2,Cheap foam,They use cheaper foam now than they used to. I am looking for different pillow. Tired ofBuying a new pillow every month.
3,A fair collection of Old West hits,"The 18 songs of the old West are good for background music, and I especially liked Sons of the Pioneers and Rex Allen. I have heard Walter Brennan in better spots. All in all, I was not sorry I bought this one, but truthfully, I like more diversity in music and vocals."
2,Good For Specific Western Guitar Songs,"The first four are classics and that is what caught my eye, but overall, they are the only ones worthwhile. So if you are looking for specific songs, it is okay. Sound quality is questionable, but tolerable."
5,Old West,Nice to reminisce to. Had sing alongs with old friends. Will be buying other Old West CDs in the future.
5,Good introduction for Vector Analysis,"In my searching for a good book to help me better understand vector analysis, I found this book and liked it very much. The text is easily understandable and is a very good introduction to this subject."
2,"Actually, 2-and-a-half stars...","As the leading civilian authority on the U.S. Secret Service, I was disappointed with this error-ridden book by the legend-in-his-own-mind Harry Neal. There IS some suprisingly good information on former Director H. Stuart ""Stu"" Knight. It has its moments, I guess...but needed a co-writer to flesh out the style and especially the FACTS."
5,Now I can ask intelligent questions,"My service dog became very ill in August. Because the auto immune disease is affecting his liver and digestive tract, nutrition is very important. The big problem is that nutrition for animls is totaly different than for humans. This book greatly helped me understand my dog's condition and has allowed me to talk intelligently with his Veternarian internist specialist. Not an easy read, but so worth the time to read up on my best friend's medical conditon and how nutrition is affected."
1,Outdated; Hazardous,"This could be a danger to some pets whose guardians rely solely on this book. This book comprises information that was gathered in the 1990's and earlier, some of which is erroneous due to poor studies and observations, and lack of knowledge of species specific nutrition. There are a multitude of sources where updated information can be found. Do some more research if you care about your pets. This book is NOT the place to start and should not be referenced."
4,As expected,"The product meets my expectations thus far. I purchased a filter wrench as well, and it makes use of the prodcuct easier."
3,"Good starting book for Dreamweaver designers, but that's it!","I took a look at this book, at the request of one of my students, to determine whether or not this was a good book for a new web designer.After looking through this book I feel you get exactly what the title says, a book on how to use Dreamweaver 3, that's it. If you are a new web designer and you are absolutely sure you will be using Dreamweaver 3.0, then buy this book. It will teach you what you need to know in order to do basic web design with Dreamweaver.This book is not a good HTML reference book. If you are looking for a book to teach you HTML, keep looking. Dreamweaver concept is built around designing web pages by typing minimal code. If you want to design web pages without knowing what is happening in the background Dreamweaver and this book are for you."
5,Excellent,This book is very well written. I learned more from this book than any other dreamweaver book I have used. A must for novices.
5,Very good book for starters and intermediate dreamweavers ..,"This book was a great learning tool. I have made one webpage with dreamweaver and I was self taught. I read this book and realized how much I was missing out on. The Quick time movies were a great supplement to the readings. I did every exercise and learned so much. I highly recommend this book to anyone trying to learn dreamweaver 3.0.The only downside is that it left out a few commands here and there, but it is a great starter book."
4,Excellent step by step instruction,I was able to learn Dreamweaver by working through the easy to read sequence of instructions. I also appreciated the technical tips on publishing. The reason I did not give it a five-star rating was because I thought the layout/graphics were a bit dull.
1,very disappointing,"there are some very famous interviews here and nothing terribly interesting besides, when you consider how well AW handled questions evidenced in countless clips in which maybe one or two questions are asked in various documentaries out there (the Barbara Rose one stands out as having especially good give and take)underwhmeling! better to stick to the Philosophy"""" book or Popism or the diaries... this volume I consider skipable"
2,The Behemoth That Won't Fold Away!,"This tent is huge, which is a plus as far as a kid's concerned, but it takes up SOOO much room. It's huge! It takes up every free inch of my son's floor in his room, and the worst thing, after ten minutes of trying to fold it up and put it away just like the instructions said to.....I'm left nothing more than furious and the giant thing is still in the middle of my son's floor.Suffice it to say, if I'm ever able to actually put it away, this will only be used on VERY special occasions because of the size of this atrocity and how difficult it is to fold it away."
4,Big tent,"I bought this for my 3 year old grandson. He loves it. I have not seen it set up, but my daughter and son in law say it is nice, but really to big. They do have big bedrooms, so it will work, but still takes up a lot of space. Very easy to set up and take down."
3,"I like the pattern, shape and size but it is made in China.",Not up to the quality of the other portmeirion Botanic items I've purchased. It is made in China not Britain and seems to have less substance.
5,Great! Exactly as hoped and wanted!,"Unit has 6 outlets in the front AND in the back. The back outlets are spaced a little which is nice. The front outlets are nice for testing, quick diagnostics OR connecting a laptop while in the closet.The three status lights are NICE just to have an idea of what's going on.Resettable breaker on the front. Switch has a cover so users can't accidentally hit it as they're walking by (or whatever :)LONG power cord, 15A standard outlet connection. WORKS GREAT to expand the CyberPower OR700LCDRM1U 1U Rackmount UPS (700VA)We'll be buying more of both the UPS and these units!"
3,"Good product, but not great.","As others had pointed out the power switch cover did come cracked and damaged. I am not sure how this happened, but I am pretty sure it was not because of a shipping problem. Also one of the rackmount arms was bent, again not sure how that happened because the shipping box and product box are both intact. The power cord is heavy duty and very long! Both great plus.. I did call the company about the broken switch cover and they are sending out out ASAP. Sadly they did not ask a lot of question and they almost made it sound like this happens often and it is routine."
5,"Excellent product, but...","I wish somebody had said to me, ""Steve, don't you want to look into a UPS first?"". I would have, and I don't know if I would have purchased this. A power strip w/UPS is $100 more. That having been said, this is a good looking and solid unit."
5,This is a MASTERPIECE!!!,"""Private Parts"" is a true masterpiece. Anyone who's ever fought against seemingly improbable odds or been scoffed at by family and so-called friends due to their ambitions will doubtlessly find inspiration in Howard's tale. There's always a need for trailblazers in our society; let ""Private Parts"" be a major motivational tool. It'll make you think and laugh. Buy it today and enjoy!"
4,"That's George's room! It's too early, he's still j**king off!","What a gem of a little movie. It's as seedy of a 1970s level exploitation film as you'll find. There is something very stark, voyeuristic and disturbing about it from the get-go. At times, it seems ludicrous that this would be a horror film, and then at others, it's hard to see it as anything but. Just a nice surprise and a terrific oddity from the director of EATING RAOUL. The ending was simultaneously stupid and enjoyable with a random laugh-out-loud moment that is right at home amid the chaos. And for horror aficionados, who still have a respect for non-torture porn, the violence is surprisingly graphic, especially for 1972. And I would be amiss not to mention Ayn Ruymen in the lead. Jail. Bait. (Though she was 25 years old at the time.) Don't know how this lady didn't have a bigger career. Absolutely stunning."
3,"Good, but doesn't keep for too long","These guys are pretty good at what they do. I'll hand that to them.. I was addicted to their song ""The Way She Feels"" for about a week. And it ended with that. They have catchy songs, grippy licks, and rich, bursting vocals, but yeah, it's not too substantial. You'll think about a month later, ""Oh yeah, I used to like those guys, but I'd rather listen to something else now."""
2,Great at first but errors later.....,when i baught it i was hoping it would organize all my mp3 files and it did but now it is giving me different types of errors and it isn't any better then my other mp3 software (jukebox 7.0) and i encourage you to think twice!
2,"Maybe you can, maybe you can't","This product doesn't do what it says it does. I bought it to record internet radio, the box says you can record anything that is playing in the output. It didn't work, I emailed magix and they said my sound card needs to have this feature. But if your sound card has this feature, you wouldn't need mp3 maker.Anyway, so so program otherwise."
3,Entertaining,"It is always interesting to have a sequel to a novel, and this one was. Good read, but a bit too much like a romance novel aimed at mainly women."
1,No color selection.,"I was wanting to get a silver brake caliber but instead I receive a White Color set. There should be a color selection on the Order page but instead it's a random color selection. If you are lucky, you get a silver or black or white. It look so odd to have a silver and white color brake set combination.The brake caliber looks solid but it's just the wrong color. So, please add a color selection on the Order page. Tks."
4,+ *: Great for learning bike,"It seems the best way for teaching children how to ride a bike is letting them learn balance by themselves (no running alongside holding the handlebars and seat). The ideal bike is an undersized one without pedals, ridden like a scooter. Since my daughter's bike has a coaster brake, I decided to add a basic hand brake.This brake set is generally simple to install. The instructions are seriously lacking. But the components are decent and complete. I like that they even include the ferrule for the cable end. Even better, this set will fit a 16"" bike. It is a little oversized, but it does fit over the rear fender on my daughter's bike.Besides the instructions, the only other complaint is the color choice. I received a black set. It looks out of place on a purple and pink with white tires bike."
2,Only good for small kids bikes,"Very small pads and poorly designed lever, not worth it except for very small kids bikes. For an adult or teen, move up to somthing quite a bit larger. I bought this for my wife and it was a waste of money."
1,wrong size description,"I bought this to replace my center pull front brake on my vintage road bike. I had several issues with this product. The bolt holding the lever on was not long enough to stay on my drop bars, and of the two bolts that came to attach the caliper only one was long enough to make it through the fork but even then it was too short to even use the included washers.(probably because it wasn't designed for a 27"" wheel/fork etc) I was almost tempted to by a replacement like i did with the lever bolt. The spring on the caliper itself was already awkwardly bent upon arrival and the caliper wouldn't open up until after i sprayed some chain lube on there. The biggest issue i had was that the sellers description said it would fit a 27"" x 1 1/4 wheel/tire but the brake shoes at the highest point still clasped below the rim. Hopefully i can still return this item even though it's been opened."
4,did its job for cheap,"it brakes nicely and looks clean but the only problem I had was it's instructions. They were hard-ish to read and i didnt understand them, plus the pictures were unrealistic looking so i was confused. i had to figure how to piece it together online. But it was cheap and fit."
3,Good Brakes but don't fit my bike.=(,I bought these and they didn't fit my bike so yeah...I'm not returning them because I'm lazy but I might sell them....
4,The best we have,"1776 is an excellent piece of musical genius. On paper the idea of a musical about the writing of the Declaration of Independence seems a bit ridiculous. Yet, 1776 pulls off the concept wonderfully. This soundtrack contains all of the songs. My only complaint about this soundtrack is that in some cases the performances that were on the film version are better. For instance, ""Molasses to Rum"" is better performed in the film. Unfortunately there is no soundtrack available for the film. So for what we have this soundtrack is extremely good. ""The Lees of Old Virginia"" is funny and over the top and I have almost cried listening to ""Mama Look Sharp"". So for what it is it is a very good listening experience."
5,Memories,"This CD brought back memories of when I did this show in high school. One of the good memories. It's a fun show and unexpectedly light for the most part. It makes me want to do it again, but play a female this time! But that's a looong story."
4,I love 1776,"I am a huge broadway fan, and 1776 is up there on my list of favorite shows with Les Miserables and Rent. My favorite songs are sit down john and mamma look sharp. Everyone go see the movie with Mr. Feenie from Boy meets world, (and by the way, did anyone notice that Mr. Feenie played John Adams, and thats the name of the school on boy meets world?)"
1,"Wonderful musical, terrible singers...","I heard the 1997 revival of 1776 before the 1969 version, but I figured, hey, this is Broadway, they can't be THAT bad. Wrong! It's still a great musical, but 80% of this cast can't sing! My favorite song, The Lees of Old Virginia, was just butchered (if you don't believe me, listen to Track 4 at about 2 minutes into the song for a nice clip). Neither was I impressed with the man who sang the part of Thomas Jefferson. The only singer whom I liked more on this CD than the 1997 version was Betty Buckley as Martha Jefferson. These men all sing flat! I was just floored at the low vocal quality. Not to mention the really...hollow voice acting. They put no passion into the dialogue. Please don't let my low rating put you off the entire musical, however. It's brilliantly written, wonderful score, and very entertaining, but please, please, PLEASE listen to the 1997 version."
1,an insult to American history,"Oh...my...God. In my social studies class we were studying the signing of the Declaration of Independence, and my Social Studies teacher thought it would be a good idea to have us watch this musical. Being the enormous fan of Broadway that I am, I was psyched. What a let-down. I mean, really. The concept that Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence because he could have sex with his wife is insulting to anyone with the least bit of patriotism. And not only that, the music was lame. It lacked variety (except for ""Mama look sharp,"" the one decent song in the show, that didn't include Jefferson's violin screeching into uncomfortable silence)."
3,1776 - The Movie Was Better,"When 1776 was first on Broadway I saw it 3 times. When the movie adaptation hit the screen, I saw it 2 times in the movies. Since then I have seen it at least 5 times on the TV and numerous times on tape. While both the Broadway Show and move were great, the music from the movie far surpassed the Broadway Show. Some of the original cast was in the movie. For some reason they sounded better in the movie. However, I think what made the difference was the supporting cast in the movie. They were far superior than the supporting cast in the show. Too bad there isn't a CD of just the music from the movie."
1,Please.................,"I was going to say this album really sucks but...........thats just not specific enough. This is an album of ideas and thoughts all of them incomplete. Whoever described this gentleman as a vocalist was sadly mistaken. His voice reminds me of a cat getting it tail caught under a rocking chair. While he is a skillful guitar player, Rachelle Ferrell used him on her sensational album ""Individuality"", he should leave vocals to someone else. While I have a massive record collection and my musical tastes can be described as eclectic(ie I'll give anything a chance/listen)I regret purchasing several of his works and they have found a home in the proverbial circular file."
2,Didn't like it,"Wesley Snipes seems to be following the same career path as Steven Seagal. This direct to DVD movie is about as B as B-movies gets. I won't give away the plot, which is very cliche. How many movies have we seen where corrupt people claim they are ""owed"" and that is why they have sold out. Why can't they admit they are greedy, and don't have a soul? Why always blame whoever it is they work for? Oh well. Like I said. Very cliche.Gun battles in this movie are lame. Watching Snipes blindly fire hundreds of rounds from a suppressed weapon, simply looked stupid.But, I guess aging action stars have to make a living too. And of course Snipes needs to get caught up on those taxes, so it may have simply been a case of desperate times calling for desperate measures. Rent it if you like Wesley Snipes movies. He's still a decent actor. Just makes too many less than decent movies. Would not recommend buying the movie."
5,Game of Death ( DVD ),"This is as always a great Wesley Snipes movie. My wife and I were in a hotel for a week and they had the movies on demand, we watched this movie 4 times. when we couldn't find it in the stores my wife told me to try amazon which I am glad I did. We now have it in our collection. This is another Edge of your seat excellent movie."
5,Great Martial Arts Action,"Great movie, I'm proud that it was shot in my hometown and two of my colleagues were involved in the production. Well done script and acting especially considering that this was put together in a rush. I loved Wesley Snipes in Passenger 57 and the first Blade Film, Although not quite the caliber of those films it did not disappoint."
3,"Another Wesley Snipes movie that actually isn't too bad. Moves aren't as good, but better then Segal. I say B.","After his client (Davi) winds up in the hospital, Marcus (Snipes) finds himself double-crossed by his team. He is in a fight for his life and for the life of his client. Lately it seems like the movies by Wesley Snipes are made just for him to get paid (and not pay taxes on). They are not entertaining to watch and look like no one is even trying. This one is the exception. A very good story and idea that actually seems well acted and keeps you engaged the entire time. I will admit though that Snipes is getting older and his moves are not the same as in ""Blade"" but still better the Segal's. This movie very much surprised me, I genuinely enjoyed it. I give it a B.Would I watch again? - I don't think I would."
4,I LOVE HARD CORE ACTION,Westley never lets you down in getting down for what he believes in and this movie is no different. KICK ASS WESTLEY!!!
3,expected more,"I just didn't think this was one of his better movies. I've seen him do much better acting rolls than this. I liked the movie and would recommend it, but not say to was a great pme tp see,"
3,Should you pay big bucks to complete your collection?,"Uh, no. I found it somewhat nauseating when I found that the only disc that I still needed to have the entire Rhino NWHOT80's collection was an OOP rarity, but my mood elevated when I got a look at the song lineup. Would someone out there actually pay in the area of $50 for the privelege of owning such a below average lineup of songs? A friend recorded this disc from a library copy that he located and I can honestly say that NOTHING on the sought after disc 7 is even close to being worthy of the big asking price. Check your local library and judge for yourself, then treat yourself to the other volumes and call your collection complete."
5,beautiful!,"This CD is beautifully done! I love the harmonies and Maggie, your voice is so lovely. Track 5 is my current favorite, but the entire CD is great for listening to on the road. Love it!"
1,Bogus copy-protected product,"Don't buy this title. It has a copy protection software that will invade your PC if you try and play on a computer. In fact, you can't play it on the PC without installing the baaaaad software. Highly invasive. I removed it and will never buy another title with this feature."
5,Short Inspiration,A short book easily read in a couple of hours which is inspiring in its view about God. Provides a helpful understanding.
5,Great little book!,I love reading stories pertaining to Native American history/traditions. This book is nicely illustrated and is a great little read for children as well as interesting for adults.
5,a must have,Brother Ray gets down on this set.cuts like black jack and i've got a woman are great.this man is a pure genius&legend.he has done all kinds of musical styles very well.the atlantic years is essential for any collection.
3,A clever little book,"A clever little book written in the guise of an afterword to a book that doesn't really exist. In this innovative format, the author discusses theological questions and the creative process as well as society in general."
4,"Good polarizer, but be careful in low light conditions","I have been happy with this polarizer so far when taking pictures of blue skies. The polarizer really accentuates the rich blue of the sky. The advertising material suggests that you won't see a significant change in f-stop with the polarizer on. However, I noticed that there is a significant difference in the f-stop, particularly in overcast or low light conditions. Some pictures I took with the polarizer on came out blurry when the camera adjusted for the lighting by keeping the shutter open longer. Fortunately, I tried all of this out quickly enough. Just to warn you."
3,Preopened and smudged,"Well I picked this brand for the positive feedback it gets about durability and resistance to dust and smudges. This first order showed up with the manufacture package already opened and the filter had dust and smudges. I started first with my lens brush to remove the dust from one side. The brush left new smudges on this filter that it never did on any of my other equipment. I then tried cleaning it and it only got worse for both sides.I returned the item same day, a few days later I got a new one. This time it was not opened and it was clean. I don't know how well this filter works yet due to overcast. And I'm scared for the day I have to clean it for any reason. I really hope this one performs better because my Hoya filter cleaned perfectly every time and cost half as much."
5,nice new toy,"My first trip out of the house with it was late afternoon, probably not the best use of this lens."
1,Horrible smell,I bought these for my son to take to work for lunch. Apparently his co-workers found the smell so offensive they asked him not to eat it at work again. Maybe it was a bad batch...
3,For $2.00 a box it's okay,"I don't plan on reordering it, but it was definitely edible and filling since I added chicken."
1,Tasteless mess,"I tried these as I love Thai food, ginger and coconut. That was my problem, as this mess does not even vaguely resemble Thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste. Plus, the noodles stick together, even when prepared as suggested, and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them.Also, the nutrition label is misleading. I am dieting and read labels very carefully. This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz (half a cup). I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package. Not so, one package is actually two servings, or over 500 calories. This is far more than any other pre-packaged noodle meal I have seen.The excessive calorie content might have been OK had the product tasted good, but it doesn't. I would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess."
3,OKAY IN A PINCH...,I bought these at walmart for less then $2.00 dollars a box.There over $2.80 a box @Amazon for (box of six).Then you need to add another $7.00 dollars to your order to get free shipping ....I would not buy these again could be better if you added chicken or an egg like other reviewers mentioned. My box does say gluten free so maybe there are 2 versions.
3,Now containing gluten!,"A year or so ago, I use to buy these quite often because they were gluten-free. Last month I decided to order some again and this product no longer says ""gluten-free"" on the packaging and contains wheat. I didn't want them to go to waste, so I ate one anyway. I became very sick. I do enjoy this product but will not be purchasing again because of the wheat. Just a warning for those of you who also have issues with wheat/gluten."
2,"not bad, but I won't reorder","Thanks for the egg tip, it works very well and really helps this product. Nevertheless, I ended up giving away three of the six containers because I was not thrilled with the nutritional information."
3,"Not bad, but it really is just a taste of thai","Not bad for a prepackaged and quickie meal. If you're looking for authentic Thai, this will give you only half the flavor, so the name that it is only a taste of Thai is quite accurate. Cartons are fancy, but big for the amount they hold. It is definitely enough for a meal, but if you're looking for a full takeout carton of food to eat, you had better grab two. It is tasty enough for a meal, but if you can get yourself to an authentic Asian supermarket, I guarantee you will find much tastier options that are also quick and easy to make with more substance and flavor and at a much lower price (ie 6 boxes of noodles for $6) - and I'm not talking about Cup O' Noodles or things you find at American supermarkets. But overall, my husband and I, being the noodle-mongers that we are, did enjoy these as something new for the palate. However, we will probably opt to order Thai takeout for fresh noodles next time we have a craving."
3,Good flavor but...,It's like eating a large box of paste. I enjoy the flavor but I usually cook them and then mix with something else I'm eating as it's a no-go straight out of the box!
2,artificial flavor,"I simply don't like it. It is easy to prepare, but when I eat it, I feel that i am eatting a lot of artificial ingredients. I cannot even finish one fourth of it....."
3,Needs a little something,"Overall, this was good, but not great. The ginger sauce seemed like it need an extra something to get it a fourth star. I think I was expecting a little more ginger taste. I'd buy it again, especially if I can find a good way to punch it up just a little more. I may try that egg tip!"
2,Not so much...,"We enjoy A Taste of Tai's Peanut Noodles... they rock. That peanutty flavor...mmm... so we decided to try these... um, Ginger, not so much. Nothing really distinguishes these from any other noodle flavor, and the ginger is a bit overpowering.Take this review in stride though, if you're a Ginger lover (and I'm not talking Gilligan's Island here), then these may be right up your alley. Just a bit outside for me, though (if I may mix my metaphors)."
5,You need to try this!,I probably eat this every week or two. I love it just as a lunch item.It has a touch of spiciness but not too much.I love the flavor.
5,Boston Pops Joy to the World,"We purchased this as a gift. It is one of our favorite Christmas ""albums"". We especially love Robin Williams narration of the Night Before Christmas. It is a great family gift."
2,Lightning Failed,"Try stream of consciousness meets Sex in the City, LA of course. Bland, rambling, is there even a thought out plot? The writing...the writing? Try insipid excursuses ad infinitum. I've read one heck of a lot of good contemporary lit, and I gave it a strong try, but I can in no way account for the good reviews. All I can guess is she's done some good stuff in the past that blinded the reviewers of this one, however, I doubt I'll give her another chance."
3,Flashes of Brilliance,"With overtones of old Hollywood glamour and new Hollywood bulimia, the sky of Spiotta's debut novel is often illuminated with lightning sharp observations and thought-provoking dialogue, but the thunder of action and character development are eerily absent. The book keeps the reader at a distance, skipping too quickly among snapshots of the three female characters. The male characters are little more than names.Lightning Field can be appreciated for its flashes of reflective brilliance, but in the end, Spiotta's scatterplot leaves the reader empty. In a book obsessed with film and set within its glossy capital, the story is ultimately celluloid and too obsessed with the close-up."
4,Robben Ford shines!,"Whoever produced this cd should be shot. It is way too slick. However, it contains a fantastic slow blues called ""Nothing's Changed"" that is one of Robben Ford's all time best solos. Spoon sings this one great as well. I think Robben does 3 or 4 solos and this cd is worth having for those alone."
2,jimmy gets funky,Not your typical Jimmy Witherspoon blues album. The songs are given funky rhythms and many of the tracks have background vocals too. It appears someone tried to update Jimmy's sound and it doesn't really work.There's much better Witherspoon out there and it's worth searching for.
4,A very intrigueing and adventurous novel.,"Mrs Frisby has a problem. Her son Timothy is diagnosed with pneumonia. He must stay in bed for at least three weeks and moving day is drawing closer! She meets a young crow named Jeremy who introduces her to an owl who could help her with her problems. He recognises her surname and sends her to the Rats. The next day she journeys to the Rosebush where they live. The Rats are super intelligent animals who have escaped from the Laborotory of Nimh. She finds out that her husband (Mr Jonathan Frisby) was a part of the escape. Together with their sophisticated methods, the Rats move her house to a safe place where the tractor won't plough. She can now stay in her home for as long as she wants - until Timothy is well. The laborotory finds the Rats and they gas the Rosebush. By this time the Rats were already settling in their new home."
2,The secret of nimh is a scary book filled with vilens,"Well were do I start. The secret of Nimh is very un educational and kids should not read this book under 10 years old.The reason Im telling you this is because if you dont want your kids to have bad dreams then I advise you not to. Robert c O'brein is a great author.Heres some books to check out in a local library Horrible harry series, Marvin redpost series,Mrs. Friby and rats of Nimh and Baily school kids series."
5,"""A very thought-provoking story""",Timothy is sick and moving day is about to come. Timothy cannot get out of bed or he might die. Mrs. Frisby doesn't know what to do for her son so she goes to the rats of NIMH. They say they will move her house so that Timothy won't die. She wnats to hlp them so she goes in the farmers house and poisons the cat's food so the rats can move her house without the worry of being eaten. When Mrs. Frisby is in the house she overhears the conversation of the family. They talk about the people from NIMH coming to poison the rats. She tells the rats and they make a plan to save themselves and not look like they were from NIMH.This was the BEST book I have ever read. I would give it a 10 out of 10. The way the author describes the scene and the characters is oustanding.
4,"An adventurous, fantasy novel.",The story is about a young mouse Timothy who falls ill and his courageous mother who will give anything to save him.The farmer ploughs the field once a year and it is time for moving day. But with Timothy terribly ill will he survive the move? Mrs Frisby goes to the old owl and asks her for advice. Go to the rats in the rosebush they have ways of doing things....She went to the rats and uncovered the myterious truth about them and the past of her dead husband Jonathan Frisby. Find out why the rats regard her husband as a hero and how they helped her to save her son.
1,FLip flops too big!,I ordered a size 7 which I always wear. They were actually a 7/8. They were huge. When I wanted to return them it would have cost $7.00 or so for shipping then the company which I recieved these from wanted a check for $5.00 to resend them. So I would have ended up paying more for all the shipping than th flip flops were worth. Vey dissapointing!
5,Great Source of Protein,"I have used All One for 6 months now and I have been very pleased with the results. Not only is my immune system improved, but the additional protein in the powder works as a great supplement. I have replaced multiple products with just this one powder. Great Stuff :D"
3,Not very good at shipping items,"Although the product is fine, I placed five other orders the same day, I have received the other five and this product is just shipping. I don't think I will buy this product from this vendor again..."
2,Good Product but the taste is odd,"I have been using the All One Original Formula for quite a while and I like the product. When I received this can of the product I noticed that it has different packaging, a more colorful label with fruit graphics. Cool I guess. Unfortunately, the taste of the product out of this can is very odd and different from what I have been getting. I am hoping this is just an ""off"" batch."
4,Great product - poor seller,"The vitamin powder is a wonderful product. As advertised, it mixes well with juice and, because of the 8gm of protein, can make you feel full (if only for a half hour to an hour). I've been finding that there are more than 66 days of product in the 2.2lb can.The seller was horrible. Took a long time to ship; after contacting the seller, their excuse was that the product was on back order with All One. Seeing other users' feedback, I believe this seller, on occasion, takes your order with no stock, then places an order with All One, and then you get it. The product took 3 weeks to ship. If you can wait, you save about $5 over the Amazon price...next time I will order direct from Amazon."
2,"Not for those who want to avoid CASEIN, milk protein","I bought this stuff a long time ago and just the other day read the ingredients more clearly.CASEIN, milk protein, is problematic. It is found in The China Study to promote cancer. Please look into this.Also, the stuff has a very vitamin taste to it.Once I put these two things together, I threw it out.I tried another ""True Vitality"". Tasted much better with a better plant based protein."
2,Disgusting sludge,"I tried this as a cheaper alternative to my usual vitamin powder (which is a crystallized lemonade-like powder), but it was a huge mistake. First of all, it does not blend well with anything--water, juice, milk--everything I tried blending it with just ended in a layer of sludge on the bottom and sides. Even if it did blend, it would not disguise the horrible taste. My usual vitamin powder has a pleasant citrus taste, but this tasted and looked like banana-flavored baby vomit.I did not take it for very long, so I can't really attest to it's energy and health boosting capabilities. I just could not get past the taste and texture--the unappetizing brownish-green color, chalky texture, and vomit flavor are not for me!"
2,Terrible Taste! Smoothie Cannot Hide The Flavor,"This vitamin powder touts itself as being flavorless, however there is clearly a bad flavor! I thought this stuff would be perfect to mix in with a fruit smoothie and get some added nutrition. The flavor of this stuff is so bad it makes a fruit smoothie taste terrible. I don't recommend this product if you are concerned about a bad flavor."
3,All One Multi Vitamin & Mineral Powder,"I bought from Vitacost, the 66 Day Supply (2.2 lbs.) It was way too much to store, or have on the counter, as I have a small duplex. The taste was not that great, but I did get used to it after a few months of trying to use it and hating it. I do feel better but the amount of gas I have after about 4 hours is weird!!!Maybe it's an over 50 thing but I don't like that side effect!"
1,From good to bad,I notice some improvement at the first hour. Then I became having stomach cramps and spent the night hugging the toilet.Thought I was going to die. The next day I tried the mix again and the same thing happen. The second time whenI notice there was bad taste to the mix. I have severe stomach aches (24 hours) for the whole week. I think I got it out of my system now. What I was vomiting was the white mix so I just have to associate it with this product.
3,Enjoyable obscurity,"This obscurity was actually a lot more enjoyable to me than any Dario Argento films I've seen. It concerns Julia (Trish Everly), a teacher of deaf kids, who has a deformed, evil twin sister named Mary. Mary escapes from the hospital and kills off Julia's friends with the help of her vicious Rottweiler. Of course, nobody believes Julia's stories, and don't get me wrong: MADHOUSE is full of cliches. But it's also fast-paced, features good acting, a solid screenplay, lots of gore, inventive visuals and cinematography, and has a nice, sick sense of humor about itself. I would strongly recommend it to horror and slasher film fans who are getting bored with the standard black-gloved killer giallos."
5,Another Winner from Rhino Records,"Popular music was reinvigorated in the first half of the 1980s by New Wave music. In the Nineties, Rhino Records culled New Wave and released 15 CDs worth of some of the genre's most noteworthy offerings in the ""Just Can't Get Enough"" series.While volumes 4, 5, 9, 10, and 11 of the series are all very strong, this volume, the eighth, might (just barely) be the strongest in the series. This disc contains some of the all-time classics of the genre, such as ""Come on Eileen"" and ""Mexican Radio."" There are six U.S. Top 40 hits here, some other songs that became widely known via MTV, and a few obscurites. And as always, Rhino does a very good job with the liner notes.The songs on the disc are mostly from the peak of New Wave, the spring and summer of 1983. This disc and others in the ""Just Can't Get Enough"" series are an excellent chronicle of one of the best genres of popular music of the rock era."
3,SGM light...,"Don't expect the kind of intensity or complexity that you'll find on a Sleepytime Gorilla Museum or Secret Chiefs 3 album. The Book of Knots, though consisting of SGM-members Carla Kihlstedt and Matthias Bossi, is far more predictable in it's melodies and song structures that one might expect and may not be a challenging enough listen for the average avant-garde/prog fan. There are some gems here (like ""Tugboat"" and ""Frank's Funeral"") and the dreamy atmosphere and Kihlstedt's creepy vocal approach may help captivate the listener. ...if only for the first 25 minutes. 3.5 stars."
3,Buy it for posterity,"Yes, this is the movie version and is an important part of 1960s pop culture, but it pales in comparison to the Broadway Cast. The sound quality is sub-par, and the voices are nowhere near as strong as the 1957 Cast. The movie also cuts some important music, or rewoks the score until it is completely different from the original. The order was also changed from the original show, and it is hard to listen to for someone that is familiar with the original. Overall, 1957 cast over this one, but buy it for the memories if you must."
4,Near perfect soundtrack,"This is a very good soundtrack of the classic film. It's only bad point being the fact that there are too many occasions when the original film elements were used, hence we have foley track noises such as dialogue, footsteps, crowd noise, etc. It is nice to have the Overture and End Credits music included, and the full Dance at the Gym sequence. Richard Beymer's vocals are by Jimmy Bryant, Natalie Wood's by Marni Nixon, and some of Rita Moreno's by Betty Wand. I've often read that Moreno did some of her own singing in this, but the CD credits Betty Wand with ALL of it. I wonder what the truth behind this mystery is. The orchestrations used in the film far surpass the Broadway originals and the singing is more polished, also. This is a definite case of a film topping it's Broadway original."
4,I like this better than...,"After seeing the stage version performed at my school, I have to say that I like the movie's soundtrack much better than the stage'ssoundtrack(although, I have yet to buy the stage's soundtrack...I'm just assuming). I think it was smart to swap ""Cool"" with ""Officer Krupke"". If you think about it, the Jets wouldn't be singing a humorous ""Officer Krupke"" right after their gang leader, Riff, has been killed. I also like that they moved ""I Feel Pretty"" before the rumble unlike the play, where they put it after the rumble. It just doesn't make sense that there would be a light song after such drama. The only reason I gave this amazing soundtrack four stars is because my favorite song ""A Boy Like That/I Have A Love"" was shortened compared to the play. I think what it all comes down is you just just make an investment and buy the stage's soundtrack AND the movie's soundtrack."
4,I Know Tony Like I Know Me,"For someone like me, a music lover who has always found Broadway musicals overblown and silly, WEST SIDE STORY is an incredible eye-opener. Bernstein found a common ground between Jazz and Classical and, once in your system, the music never leaves you.Some of the spoken word on this CD sound is beyond corny now--you get the feeling it was outdated upon release--but Sondheim more than makes up the difference with his lyrics. If you aren't moved by ""There's A Place For Us,"" you don't have a heart."
2,Poor sound quality,"Sound quality varies too much. I realize that some songs start out softly and build; but in order to hear the beginning, I have to turn the sound way up and then when the song builds, it knocks me out of my chair."
5,Russ Tamblyn is spectacular in WEST SIDE STORY!,"This is the best soundtrack ever! The movie is so good,especially Russ Tamblyn's performance. Russ Tamblyn(Riff), the bestactor EVER- his voice is great, he dances and sings very well too in West Side Story. The best songs(it's hard to choose) in my opinion are ""Gee, Officer Krupke"", ""Cool"", ""America"", ""Jets Song"" ,and ""Tonight(Quintet)"". George Chakiris is also in this musical, and he is also a great singer. Rita Moreno, Natalie Wood, and Richard Beymer's voices were dubbed, but they are very talented actors. If you only see one more musical or listen to one more soundtrack, listen to WSS."
1,-minus 5 stars,"Can't get around the 50 years worth of stereotypes. I know it was ""unintentional"". But I hate it just the same."
2,cd tracks defective - lesson learned..,"I was delighted with the West Side Story soundtrack CD.I listened to the first several songs, and they were wonderful. Then I didn't get a chance to listen to the rest for several weeks.To my dismay, the last several tracks were defective. What a letdown. And by this time I had disgarded the packaging and paperwork.Lesson learned- AGAIN - listen to the ENTIRE CD before throwing anything away"
3,Classic soundtrack has disappointing expansion!,"The movie soundtrack for WEST SIDE STORY is among one of the all time greats. A huge best selling LP, I cannot think of one individual who grew up with LPs that did not have a copy. I greatly anticipated this long-awaited ""expanded and re-mastered"" CD release, expecting generous underscore segments, which could not be included on the LP format. Unfortunately I was disappointed to learn that the new material is simply lifted off of the final, ""mixed"" film tracks, which come complete with dialog, sound effects and lengthy silent sequences. Therefore I can only recommend this release with reservations. The CD's producers have missed a great opportunity to give West Side Story's' soundtrack the ultimate audio presentation which would have been possible if the ""unmixed"" music masters were utilized."
3,Its the movie version...,"West Side Story is quite the classic, and I fully suggest you get a copy, but I would go with the Original Broadway Cast. I suggest you get the DVD (or VHS) version and then you will hear this soundtrack. But the cast on this CD is not the best. There are some harmonies that are just off and not harmonies. West Side Story is a ""modernized/americanized"" version of Romeo & Juliet and really made the public stare uncomfortably at racism and prejudices. Berstien uses music to raise some of the hairs on your neck, and Sondheim uses lyrics to make sure your getting the message. It was a turning point for broadway, so this is an important musical, however, this is not an important version. Again, I strongly suggest the Original Broadway Cast. Favorite Song: ""Tonight"""
3,Good little introduction to a huge topic,"The book amazingly summurizes how the Israelites understood Justice. He goes trhough the major texts of the Hebrew Bible and analyzes the context in which they were writte. He constantly keep an eye on the Near Eastern texts which are, more or less, older than some sections of the bible.The book, however, has 78 pages of text, and, even though it was published in 1996, all the works cited go all the way to 1991. It feels as though something is lacking, but overall it's a good little introduction to a huge topic"
1,Shoddy Quality,"We were extremely disappointed with the poor quality of this hooded towel. Buying organic baby items was something we did without hesitation because we believe it is better for our daughter. The downside is usually the cost, and we were eager to find an organic hooded towel for such a low price. The reason why the price is so much less than other organic hooded towels is the terrible quality. The trim came off in several places after 2 washes, and the towel itself is unraveling in those areas. It's also not nearly as absorbent as other hooded towels, which is frustrating when we are trying to get our daughter dry as quickly as possible after a bath.You get what you pay for...don't buy this towel!"
1,"NOT ""finer baby products""","I wish I could give negative stars for this item. This company - Bumkins - touts their line of products as ""finer baby products."" This is simply not the case. I wash everything I order before doing anything else with it and this towel fell apart immediately. The lovely satin trim promptly detached from the terry and I have a rag the same day as receiving a product I paid $25 for! Simply unacceptable and I'm irritated that I have to spend time and energy returning this junk. So disappointed."
4,Good Product,"I recently purchased Bumkins organic products for a friend and she was very happy with them. They were put to use immediately and fit the newborn nicely. I wasn't able to find many organic products on Amazon, but this was one of the items that was available. My only complaint is that some items were back ordered for about a month."
4,Good towel,"The towel is better than regular hooded cotton towels, however, it is not as absorbent as I had expected."
1,Fell apart in the first wash!,"Of course we all want as much organic stuff as possible, but if you are going with this product, only order it if you know how to sew or have a friend who does.Fortunately, since I can't even make buttons stay on, my friend's mother is repairing it for me.The seams came apart on the first wash. There wasn't enough fabric sewn in for it to hold together? I guess they were trying to be stingy with fabric.Received this as a gift, and would definitely not recommend it."
2,scratchy,"This towel was soft at first, then got scratchy after multiple washings. My baby didn't seemed to mind it, but I got a different towel for her. The washcloths stayed soft, though."
3,A BIT SMALL,"Even though the dimensions are listed in the description these seem small and we can not use the hood at all, it will not go over our toddlers average sized head, I doubt it would fit most babes over 6 months old. We gave it 3 stars because 1. we can still use the body of the towel, 2. it is fairly thick (not like a thirsty adult towel) compared to hooded towels found at the ""Super Stores"" and 3. it is still putting organic next to skin."
2,Not soft,"Unfortunately, these towels/wash cloths are pretty rough. Instead, try Under the Nile (from Giggle and others), Sage Creek (Giggle, etc), or for the softest ever bamboo towels (I got mine at Earthsake)."
2,Frays quickly,"Within first four weeks of use, the towel ripped away from the satin trim. The look is nice but unfortunately the quality is not there."
4,Packaging,"The packaging for this book liike like it was eaten by a mouse. The packaging had multiple holes in one of the corners. Overall happy with the book, was worried at first by the way the packaging was."
3,Excellent chair; poor instructions and packaging.,"Although you can find much less expensive chairs in other sites, this one is a good choice for those who, like me, have back issues and have to spend a great deal of time at a desk. Unfortunately, the assembly instructions are very poor and, unless one has a great deal of experience and know-how, the process of putting it together can be lengthy and frustrating. My final rating is: 4 stars for the chair/price combination, and 1 star for the instructions. Time around for delivery was reasonable. Packaging was poor (it came apart in transit)."
1,I wish I had returned this chair.,"I have regretted buying this chair since it arrived. It was difficult to put together, and it is one of the least comfortable office chairs that I own. This is a definite case that I would not have purchased the chair had I sat in it first. Ultimately, I chose to keep it since taking it apart and returning it was a hassle. Now it just sits in the corner collecting dust while I use my old chair instead."
5,I love this set of DVDs,"Exciting, fun, easy to learn from, just simply perfect. My sister and I learned so much from it. Ms. Polgar is the coolest teacher ever!"
1,Real All Reviews,"I recommend to everyone interested to read Thal Ajoni's review before they make a decision to buy any of these videos. It's awesome, but these video's sure aren't!!!"
3,"Good, but...","This is a nice cabinet, but it has very sharp corners. We ordered two and one came with some small mirror paint chips. I thought about returning it, but they are minor. We really like the stainless steel interior."
4,Cool looking medicine,"I really like this medicine cabinet. I didn't have any issues with it being damaged at all. I like this cabinet because of its stainless steel construction and adjustable glass shelves inside. When I purchased it, I though the front door was stainless steel as well, but its actually a bevelled mirror. Other than that, I have no complaints at all."
2,Al,"ordered NuTone 1447 Galena recessed medicine cabinet.it looked nice, but the edges on the mirror were really, really sharp.especially the four points. so i sent it back. i had read a few reviews that mentioned edges were sharp. Really, how sharp can they be? well, they were.I purchased a Robern RC1620D4FP1 instead, more costly but worth it."
5,Very Nice,Nice quality; I really like the stainless steel interior which gives the cabinet a feeling of quality. Might buy another for my 2nd bathroom.
1,Scratches way to easy.,Upon first cleaning this filter I ended up with scratches on it. I was using Zeiss pre-moistened lens wipes. I've used these wipes on my cheap Tiffen filters and the glass is so clear it looks see though. Not sure what happened with the B&W but it has to be a product flaw and not these wipes that I've used on lens' and filters. I'm sorely disapointed in this filter. Would not recommend.
2,Good tools when they work,They are powerful and long charged BUT the recipro broke all to pieces internally the first time I used it. The drill case broke the first time it was used and now the chuck is stripped. Of course it is warrantied but so far it has taken a long time to get the parts and what does one do while it is being fixed? Guess that is why it has a 5 year warranty!!! This has only been used at home so the use is not like a pro would subject it too.
5,Hitachi has always been a durable product,"I still have the 9.6 volt drill I purchased over 15 years ago. It has fallen off buidings, kicked around, bounced about in the back of my truck. Still runs fine. Compound miter saws used day in and day out for years, still cut true. I can see the same contrator quality is here at an unreal price."
1,not an exact fit - very universal,"very unhappy with the product.Supposed to be built for the machine.Machine sits in base very sloppy.wheels are cheap, lock sucks.will never buy another HTC product.I could have built one better and more cost effective."
5,It's a wow!,"We've all heard ""Go down Moses""...at least we think we have. This NEW version brings NEW beauty to an ancient favorite. The arrangement is superb. The voices are superb. The effect is superb. An amazing and moving experience.If you've never heard Chicago a cappella, this would be a wonderful first exposure to a group so musical, so diverse, so entertaining that you'll wish to revisit it often."
3,spirituals lite,"Yes, they can sing. But can they sing spirituals? Yes. But do I want to hear them sing spirituals? NO. White people singing spirituals is boring and tired."
4,Must have for your cordless driver!!!,"I love this thing! I bought a second one to throw into my extra cordless drill. The length is good (allows you to get into most places...not much longer than other bits). Swapping out bits is a breeze! Note: it doesn't use the ""Power"" style bit with the relief to lock it in, but the magnet is sufficient to keep the bits in place (plus it keeps the driver shorter in overall length). The first one I bought has lasted for YEARS of medium duty use. I like the sleeve that covers teh screw, doesn't always work for longer screws (but I have a longer version of this for those rare occasions)."
4,Revies WW@ Vol 2,"I am in mt mid-sixties (1941). I enjoyed Volume 2 better than the original CD. Both were good and if you are from my generation, you should enjoy either one."
5,Wonderful!,I bought Volume 1 for Father's Day and my Dad just loved it. He told me that it took him back 65 years! He asked me to get Volume 2 for his 91st birthday! He is in heaven listening to his music. Great purchase for the older set who will love to reminisce about the old times!
5,An heirloom.,It's such a beauty! Paula Vaughan's artistic expression is incredible! Must get a copy - even if you don't stitch. It's so beautiful just to look at!
5,This plays anywhere!,"I love this CD! The music is artistically and technically excellent, yet with an intimate quality that feels as if you're an audience of one.I orginally used this CD to meditate. I'd play it as I read Scripture or just sat peacefully in a big, overstuffed chair.I soon realized that this would be a great tool in comforting birthing women. As a professional labor coach, I'm always looking for ""tools"" to help comfort and alieviate pain in labor.My clients have remarked how relaxing and soothing In The Stillness is. One client has suggested that the CD would be great to play in a baby's room, to soothe him/her to sleep.This is just a great CD overall - background music, contemplative prayer, the labor room, the nursery. It plays anywhere!"
5,"If relaxation is your goal ""In The Stillness"" is for you!","This CD contains a wonderful collection of powerful yet also soothing pieces that not only the music fanatic but the casual listener will enjoy, as well as children of any age."
2,THIS IS NOT ORIGINAL MR STICKY- BEWARE,"Just a warning, I googled Mr Sticky lint roller and this is what showed up on Amazon - This appears to be the original and is advertised as the ""AS SEEN ON TV"" one But its not -I was disappointed when it arrived, and realized it was not the ""Mr Sticky"" brand. I have not used it because I bought them as gifts - I do have the orignal MR Sticky brand and it does work! I am just hoping this works as well."
1,Useless.,"This item works great for only a couple swipes then you need to rinse it. It is useless. If you want to clean the cat hair from your sofa, you would need to swipe and rinse about 30 times. The lint removers with tape work much better."
1,What a waste of money,"I bought two of these Tape less Lint Rollers. I used one yesterday and it was ok, rinsed it and dried it as per instructions. This is the second day and there is no sticky at all. Thought this would be such a money saver, looks like it's back to the disposable I go."
4,a MUST HAVE for pet owners,"I rescue siberian huskies and currently have 4 living in my house. Mr. Sticky is a LIFE CHANGING product for me. Yes, I have to rinse it 10 times a day, but I hate throwing away all of the tape that comes on a traditional lint roller. And if you want it to dry faster, just swipe it over a microfiber cloth and it is instantly sticky and dry again. LOVE this product and am so happy with my purchase!"
1,Beware of knock off products like this.,"I own the genuine Mr Sticky, and absolutely love it. I especially love the one with the long extender handle for cleaning ceilings. No other product does that! I do have to rinse often, but it's not that big a deal, as it holds a LOT of dust and dries quickly.However, this is NOT the original. Mr Sticky has 6 holes in the handle. I don;t own the product shown here and would not buy it, based on the reviews. Mr Sticky will cost you 25.00 for a set of 3 sizes. It's WELL worth it. 'Companies that produce knock offs are stealing from the original designer, so it's no big surprise they also steal from their end customer. From the reviews here, it appears that this company is doing exactly that. If your rip off product doesn't work - address it with the company and Amazon. And learn your lesson - buy a knock off and you participate in unethical business practices. Knowingly do it and you deserve to be ripped off."
4,Good balance but a little to aggressive.,"Pros: Good balance and ergonimics. I installed my own dust adapter to my shopvac so no worries about dust collection.Cons: Low setting is not low enough as its still too aggressive. Coupled with the wide movement range, doesn't make it ideal for fine sanding.Good value overall."
4,Random Orbital Sander,"I love this product. I wish that there was a 1 1/2"" dust port adapter for dust collection purposes."
2,Questionable performance,"The item freezes every time a setting is changed from within it's software console. I have to reboot it by unpluging it for a minute or so. This happens 95% of the time.the speed varies for the wire connection. I use two laptops. One has a built in 54g and the other one has the 802.11b. The router handles both connections, however, the speed gets slow for no apparent reason. It works fine with the LAN line.I had a Belkin 802.11b until I upgraded it with this DLink 802.11g. However, knowing the problems with this router, I wouldn't do it again. At the same time the problems are right on the verge of discarding this, so I've been riding on the fence about whether to spend money again or continue to use this. if you have a high tolerence for hickups, this product will be fine."
5,Solid product,"Took me about 5 minutes to install and set up. Gives me a slightly better range than my last Netgear 802.11b router. It's been running smoothly for 2 weeks since I had it - no dropoffs, fade outs. 5 Stars for my experience so far.Haven't really used DLink support (didn't need it) or read the product documentation (again no need), so I can't really comment on those."
4,Excellent equipment,"I bought the DI-524 with a DWL-G122 USB adapter (bundle kit). I was thinking if a USB adapter will be working fine as a wireless card. It's great, excellent, with an USB extension cable you may put the USB adapter in a better place near to the laptop for a better recepcion. I have signal in all areas of my house, and after two weeks of the installation, I don't needed to restart the router at any time. I prefer Linksys equipment, but if you want a good equipment with lower price, you have to consider D-Link. I give four star, because the installation guide should have more information. Make sure to read the manual in the installation CD or the Internet. After you read the instalation instruction, the process is very easy and quickly. Remember that WEP encryption if not activate by default."
2,Unreliable,"It of course always hard to say whether you got a bad unit or whether all are bad. I know for sure that my router is unreliable and conclude from the other reviews that at least the quality control in the production of this router is very poor. You might get one that works reliably, but your chances are not good.My router stops broadcasting a wireless signal after a day or two of operation and frequently does not allow new clients to connect (they often time out when trying to obtain an IP address). I believe this router did work ok for the first year or two, but now it is almost unusable and I have switched to using a different router instead."
3,Good for basic home use.,"I have had this router for 2 years and it has worked well. I haven't experienced any problems I've read in other reviews such as disconnects, however I found that when running many simultaneous connections (Bittorrent), the router would sometimes begin to refuse incoming connections and would have to be rebooted to resolve the problem. Other than that it has worked fine both wired and wireless connections are stable and configuring my LAN was not a problem. This router is fine if you are just going to surf the web but if you want to do anything that would require multiple/high bandwidth connections you should look for something better."
4,Good Product,I didnt have any problem with this product. It was easy to install the software and it was up and running Over all a good product.
2,Crash with 2.4GHz Phone,"Every time I answer my 2.4GHz phone, the Internet connection out of my DI-524 drops for both the wireless AND the LAN! I have changed channels on both devices many times. I also have the latest Frimware."
1,Total frustration,"After an hour of trying to get this to work, I gave up. Although I got a signal, I couldn't get on the internet. So I returned it and got Netgear's version instead (WGR614). I had the Netgear product up and running in less than 10 minutes. Don't waste your money on the D-Link product unless you have a degree in computer science. If you want plug and play simplicity, go with Netgear."
4,It is simple and easy to use,"I bought this thing a couple of months back. I had learnt from a friend of mine that it is not a good router. However I could not resist the price at which it was available. THOUGH MY MAIL-IN REBATE HAS NOT REACHED ME EVEN AFTER TWO CALLS.Anyways, I found this thing to be very simple and easy to use.Simple English that we have learnt so far is good enough for the installation. I was a first time user so followed the book to the hilt and faced no issues. It is still running happily. I keep power cycling it (once a month) when I'm bored with nothing else to do. And I can catch the signal from my parking lot, don't ask me why i do that."
5,Amazing Product,DI-524 is an amazing piece of work. I have purchased one 6 mnths before and till today I havent faced any issues. At home we have 1 desktop [wired] and 4 laptops [wireless] connected to it and we havent faced any issues. Data transfer rates were always good. We have never switched off our router since the day we have installed it. Installing the product is very very simple just blindly follow the 2/3 page PDF that comes with it. Buy it and dont feel later :)
5,D-Link Router: Grade-A Material!,"Upgrading from a Microsoft router to this name-brand fine piece of quality was wonderful. Not only was it easy to set up/use and reliable, but the specific configuration options for the router are awesome. Perfect for a family's basic needs, perfect for a pro's customization."
1,Horrible Router,Worked decent for the first month. Now it crashes every few hours or more and looses wirelesss signal every half hour. I got it for $10 but that was way too much. I have Rev-E with 5.10. Stay away!!!
3,You must use old firmware to make this router work,"The newer versions of the firmware destroy performance and make this router virtually worthless. I found that out the hard way. I had to go back to factory settings, then install firmware 1.03 from January 2004 and I haven't had a problem since. It sounds crazy but there are well documented problems from the firmware upgrades with this router. I'd give it 5 stars for performance and 0 for tech support / product support for the unusable firmware upgrades."
3,Nice design but rebooting sucks..,"I have an old Linksys Router w/o WLAN. I got this to replace my router as well as 11b AP. Nice design on the outside but everytime you make a change, it needs to reboot. For example, if I add a MAC address of a PC to the router, it reboots each time I add one. So if I have 3 PCs, it needs to reboot 3 times. And reboot isn't fast - maybe 30 secs. or so. I've found it annoying.I guess once it's set up and if you don't plan on making any changes, it's alright. But I am going to get a Linksys Router w/11g and returning this.Oh, btw, instruction manual says, turn off both cable modem and router, turn cable modem on, leave router off for 2 minutes, and turn the router on, and wait 30 secs. It works but what is this about??? :-("
4,Great inexpensive wireless router - minor trouble setting up,"This router works flawless. I would have given it 5 stars, but I had trouble getting the WAN to work. The solution was written by a Jack Szwergold. I was about to return this product until I found Jack Szwergold's post. I wasted 3 hours of my time trying to troubleshoot. Thanks Jack Szwergold.I would recommend this product. Read the Jack Szwergold's post if you have cable broadband."
2,Hope you're patient,"Either I'm stupid or the reviewers who found this thing easy to set up are just lucky. I fought with this thing for several hours and two calls to customer service. Both useless, by the way. The instructions are beyond horrible. They're inadequate clues at best. The encryption process is cruel. You have to do it in the proper order - I believe the base computer you're using for set up and then the your wireless computer. No mention of the order in the directions. Learned by trial and error. Do it backwards and you lose your connection. No instructions for the event you just want to set up your wireless computer without a base 'setup' computer. Having never done encryption I didn't realize that I supply the encryption code. Finally figured that out. Possibly the others out there are just as bad. Now that I've got it set up, it generally works fine. I also set up a d-link wireless printer adaptor. Equally frustrating and directions better but left out one very important fact."
1,Beware! Poor quality,"I have 25 yeasr expetience with PCs and networking. I am not a pro, but a fully qualified home user, having setup and used many systems. This router was not hard to install, but it requires frequent resets. The range gradually decreased, until after 3 months it does not work at all. Buy any other wireless router. I will not buy any D-Link product again."
4,So easy,"I read all the reviews and finally decided on this router to replace my malfunctioning Robotics router. I was expecting a certain amount of headaches during the swap over. I have DSL. I put in the CD first as it told me too. I am still in shock as to how easy it was. I found the range to be acceptable. For reasons I never understood before I could not get enough range from my Robotics router and wireless card. I did buy the Dlink wireless adapater for my PC at the same time. Once again I actually followed the instructions and once again it was a breeze, however I expected that one to be easy. I was up in 15 minutes, surfing the net on my two PCS and my laptop. For the price and the ease of use it's a win win in my book."
1,D(ie)-Link Router,"After reading the reviews over here, all I can say is that I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased the router. I also, like many others, bought the router due to its lower price and have been repenting ever since. The router dies on me at least five time a day, sometimes at an hourly basis and sometimes even sooner. It automatically ""freezes"" and the only way to get it working again is to reset it, other times when I am ""lucky"", it just resets itself. It is a pain using this product and I am looking for a better alternative for this."
2,Only worked for a year and a half,"Bought this in 12/04. Just an FYI, allow windows to manage your network connections to get it to work. Worked fairly well but just died last week 6/1/06. Not very impressed that it only lasted 1.5 years"
2,"um, it was free!!","well, ive had this for maybe a year now maybe a little more or maybe a little less, cant recall to be exact but it has finally given me enough crap that i had to go and buy another one.for the past 2.5 weeks i lose connections once aday. first thought it was the dsl modem, so i bought one, seemed to have fixed the issue but nope. so i finally caved and bought a Buffalo WHR-G54S wireless router.the d-link when i bought it was known for having issues but i thought it might have been more cause people didnt know what they were doing and well it gave me a few at the beginning but i fixed it, but now its just do darn much. not worth the headaches in the long run. i recommend buffalo and dont skimp out cause of price. i get to aggirvated and its not worth it for you either!!"
2,Flakey,"Look, this is an OK product if you do not use heavy networking. If you play games or fileshare, you may have problems. I bought one for ~$20 after rebate, and I'm glad I did not spend and more on it. Mine will start the cycle of rebooting every 20 sec until I reset the thing. This was caused only during load from the wired side. This should not be a hard load for a wired connection to handle. You may want to consider a Linksys. It is worth the extra money."
2,You get what you pay for,"There's a reason why this router is often ""free"" or heavily discounted: it's a sub-par model. High-speed transfers, downloads, and radio streams are often suddenly dropped because of spotty reception. I've been kicked off of internet game sites, and a friend of mine gets kicked off of X-Box live all the time with this router.Sure, it's cheap and relatively easy to set up, but I recently got a Netgear router, and it's much better, especially in terms of reliability and security. I hear Linksys is pretty good too. If you don't use the internet very much, then this model is fine, but if you want something reliable, get another brand."
5,Very Good Product for the Money,"I have installed this router in my parents house and I have the model up from this one DI-624 and they are both very similar. This is like the DI-624 due to it's reliability and wireless coverage area. It is different in regards to it's max speeds (base speeds are the same) physical size, and cost.I love my DI-624 and this DI-524 gives my parents zero problems. The setup wizard on this DI-524 is very straight forward and walk you through crucial steps rather nicely. I'd recommend it to all."
2,Incompatabilities,"As long as the rest of your wireless equipment is DLink, you may never have a problem, but try using a cheaper non-DLink card and you quickly find out that you've been locked in. I've never had problems with the router, but it really narrows your choices when you're looking to use a cheaper h/w or share connectivity with non-DLink friends."
4,D-Link make it pretty easy to get a wireless network up-and-running,"This D-Link wireless router was easy to connect to for configuration but it took a visit to the D-Link site to figure out how to secure my network as the configuration utility was not intuitive.My two PCs use the G-122 USB key to connect to the network. These work like a dream with Vista once you can find the driver at the D-Link site. Vista sorts out all the configuration for you. Also works well with Windows 2000 but you have to configure the USB key using a utility, which is not that intuitive to use - again a visit to the D-link support site is required to figure out how to set up a security. G-122 didn't work on my Windows ME PC when the network was secured but did work when it was unsecured.Had to change my router to channel 11 to avoid interference from my 2.4GHz Panasonic cordless phone.Altogether a pretty good product for D-Link that makes it easy to set up your own wireless network."
3,"No syslog support, email is unauthenticated, but its solid","I found this in a box of computer parts in my garage while looking for something toprovide legacy WEP access to my network. I have no idea where I got it from.Can't get syslogs from this thing, only emails, and those areunauthenticated...quite lame. Signal strength is good, though, and itpunches a signal out more typical of costlier units.I have it out in a DMZ, handling legacy WEP access.For managed environments with multiple subnets, thats about theonly place to safely put something like this.Its el-cheapo, but a solid el-cheapo with WPA/WPA2 and mac/ip/site filtering. I have not used the WPA support as I have that handled bymore capable hardware. I do make use of its filtering capability,so its not totally defenseless out there in the DMZ running WEP.For something almost cheap enough to find free in a box of cereal its a good little gizmo.3-stars."
3,"Good and easy to setup, but nothing extraordinary here","Nice wireless router, easy to set, I've never had any internet hiccups, and it's on all the time. The bad things? First of all, its range: I live in a condo, and when I'm in the other room, signal weakens to 60-70% (drywalls, no concrete here). I can't imagine what would happen if I lived in a house. Speed is fine, even on 20-30% of the full signal range. Oh yes, one more problem: when my laptop goes to standby/sleep modes, when I awake him, my internet is gone. I have to restart either the router or the laptop itself. Not sure whether this is the problem with the router or my computer.Overall, what would you expect for app. 30$? Good value for this price."
2,Not worth the money,"I have used this router for over a year now, and I have finally had enough of the darn thing needing to be unplugged for 5-10 mins after any power hiccup. I've never tried the 'freezer method' that Uwe uses (see below), but I have the exact same issue on a Rev D product. The reset button is useless... I am buying a Linksys this time. Maybe I can dump this one on eBay."
2,"Cheap, effective router. But buggy.","This router has a great price, especially when on sale. The firewall (built in) is pretty good as well. But the problem with D-link, with their 500 series is that it disconnects you from the internet occassionally.---------------------------------This can be solved by unpluging/plugging,through command prompt (start>run and type CMD) (type ipconfig/release and then ipconfig/renew).You can also run through the wizard (type 192.168.0.1 in the address bar, put in username/password, press wizard. go through steps.)---------------------------------But its still annoying. I suggest paying a little extra to buy a less buggy router."
1,Never buy D Link,"I bought this unit about a month ago, it worked well for the first fifteen days. Now it crashes every few hours or more and looses wireless signal every half hour. It locks up and needs to be reset at least 2 to 3 times in a day. Its frustrating when you constantly loose signal.In short: Don't spend money on this, its not worth it."
2,Crash a lot,"the connection speed and ease to use are all fine. but it crashes too often. seems like it's sensitive to the electricity also. besides the everyday , now and then crash, it crashes when ever i have power surges.... and you have to unplug everything , including all the network cables on it , to make it alive again.my is a HW D firmware 4.00, no updates yet on the web"
4,Rough beginning,"After a lot of hair pulling and trying to understand the minimalist instructions, I finally (for now) have this thing working. Setup was tough, unit did not want to communicate with my laptop and stopped transmitting entirely several times. I finally figured that it and SBC DSL don't like each other. Since I've deleted all SBC software it has been working great. Don't just uninstall the DSL connection software, search it out and delete it. I think that their software is like spyware and doesn't give up easily. Worked for me at any rate, after having tried everything I could think of and the booklet/help manual suggested. Hope this helps someone."
1,piece of junk,"Even when it was working it would drop the signal every 30 minutes. However, just over a year of having it, it suddenly stopped working. No power at all. Call customer support - tough luck it was over the one year warranty. You get what you pay for. Stay away from this piece of junk."
1,disabling ssid broadcast and enabling wpa failed,"Disabling ssid broadcast doesn't work - the ssid is still seen by my laptop.wpa doesn't work w/the dlink DWL-G630 card though I suspect it's the card's fault.Returned for another brand's router and card. Disabling ssid broadcast works, ie, the ssid is hidden. And wpa works very for a few hours straight so far."
1,Simply didn't work and customer support was useless ...,"I meticulously followed the instructions, and it didn't work. I called customer service, which (after lengthly holds) referred me to my ISP provider. After confirming with my ISP provider that everything was fine on their end, I called back customer service for the router(and again waited forever). The advice was fairly simple -- try power cycling, checking some basic (obvious) settings, telling me to substitute different ethernet cables, etc., and equally useless. At the end -- the ""customer service"" representative basically said -- sorry sir -- frankly some of our routers just aren't compatible with certain cable modems."" He then gave numerous examples (not relating to my provider -- Starpower -- with a 3-Com Cable Modem) and then suggested that I should return it and maybe try a few other D-Link models which ""might"" work --- what a waste of effort, money and time ... Ridiculous."
1,No cheap to be good,"I bought this router mainly because of a $40 rebate offered through Bestbuy. Since I got such a good deal...I wasn't expecting it to be the best router I could find. I was just looking for something simple to set up a small network in my apartment. It was easy enough to install, but the quality of the connection was terrible. It keep droping from the internet about every five minutes. I downloaded the upgrade from the support site, and still the same problem. This is definately an item that is priced too good to be true."
2,Drops PPPoE DSL Connection Every 20 minutes,"I have a similar problem to what other users are reporting, it drops the connection every 20 minutes. I would downgrade to firmware 1.03 but that firmware made my FTP uploads extremely slow."
1,Waste of money,"This router only lasted a week or so prior to having consistent problems. It's gone through pretty much everything mentioned on this page and has made me jump through all kinds of hoops (including having to use IE to manager the router settings because their javascript on the config pages doesn't work in Firefox) just to keep it functioning. Thank you D-Link. I've learned a valuable lesson, worth much more than the $30 I paid - Next time I feel like gambling, I'll buy a lottery ticket.Just for kicks - here's the latest problem with this router that I've come across: random DNS failures, even when setting DNS to OpenDNS IPs. Example: www.yahoo.com will fail while www.google.com will load."
1,Works fine for a year then dies without warning,"I've had this router for a little over a year and it's worked perfectly during that time. However, recently the internet (WAN) port seems to have stopped working, and I can no longer access the internet either through wireless or through a wired connection. The WAN indicator light is on and blinking, and the PC light on my cable modem is also on, showing that they recognize each other, but there is no internet traffic going through. I tried resetting the router, reverting back to factory settings, and upgrading the firmware, but no luck. I had to finally resort to hooking up my cable modem directly to my computer to use the internet. I haven't tried contacting tech support, but after calling them a couple years ago for another Dlink router I had and spending close to two hours on the phone with them, I'll pass. Time to toss this piece of junk in the trash."
2,"It works, and then it doesn't...","I purchased this router based on...SIGH...the price. They never sent me my rebate, so that was always a bit of a sore spot, but even worse was the performance. Now it DID work. Sometimes. But I'd have to come home and reset it all of the time, and it was especially temperamental in the mornings... I do believe it was tied to power fluctuations (lightning, power outages, etc.) as written below, but it doesn't matter. After less than one year, the unit simply doesn't work now, can't be hard reset, and really can't be used. The moral of this story, is of course: 'you get what you pay for'."
2,be prepared for reboots/freeze!!!,"I totally agree with frustated people who bought this after reading other's good reviews. This product has many revisions. Atleast do not buy Revision 'D'. You can have a look below the product for revision number. It SUPPORTS :) multiple freezing and it does it without any known reason. Everything would be functioning fine and then suddenly my internet would stop working...I would then go, pull out power and turn it on again...and it would start working again."
1,Incompatible with satellite,"Despite the proposed work-arounds recommended by D-Link, this router does not work with Direcway/Hughes satellite internet service! I spent a whole day trying to add a wireless notebook computer connection to my existing wired desktop computer setup using the D-Link DI-524 router without success. The D-Link disk manual and online Help were basically worthless. A hub or switch and a wireless access point is apparently what is needed for satellite instead of a router."
1,terrible support and build quality,"Support is unreachable (their phone system will answer 24/7, but it's unknown if anyone is actually ever there), and the router flat out doesn't work when reset. I mean, come on. If you reset a router, you should at least be able to get into it via normal LAN mode. The lights are on, but noones home. Look elsewhere."
3,Adequate - but does not support non-IE browsers,"After a recent firmware upgrade (to the current version, 1.21), I can no longer configure the router from browsers other than IE 6 in Windows. Using Safari 2 or FireFox 1.5, I can view the configuration, but when I try to apply changes, absolutely nothing happens when I click the apply settings button. Opera allows me to change some settings but not others.Several emails to D-Link support later, and I'm told that this is a known issue with no known date to fix. D-Link's official support position is to use IE, despite the specs for the router showing that any Java-compatible browser will work.I don't support companies that don't support my platform (Mac) so I'm unlikely to buy another D-Link product.Other than this issue and the support surrounding it, the performance of the product has been exactly what you'd expect from this class of router. It's easy to set up and works."
2,JUNK! STAY AWAY,"Unfortunately I bought this router (aka junk) from Amazon. Never worked smoothly. Did not like WPA. After I set the the protocol to WPA and restarted it, the router froze. Updated firmware, no use. Now its not working. Power is intermittent, will shut off whenever it wants. Freezes randomly. This garbage is going back to Dlink today. Dlink tech support also said that they are having a HUGE number of complaints with 524 especially revision D.I will never buy another Dlink. DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND AVOID DI-524"
1,Last D-Link,Had the 514 B router that worked great. Tried the 524 and had nothing but trouble. Had to send the first one back. They said they had a bunch of bad chips. The second 524 worked for a couple months and then refused to keep a connection. Finally bought a cheap Belkin and no more problems. The 524 goes in the junk heap. Not recommended.
2,Wireless Nothing,"I purchased this router as a wireless solution for my college house. The idea of not having ethernet cable snaking every which way, and through the walls seemed pleasant enough.No one could maintain a connection to the wireless network for more than 20 minutes at a time. I tried upgrading the firmware, even using open source firmware, but to no avail. I ended up returning the product to Amazon, who gave me a refund. Getting my money back was the most satisfying part of buying this router.I can't recommend this product for people in search of a cheap, but reliable wireless solution. If you're willing to sacrifice quality for price, consider yourself warned.I opted for an SMC Barricade model instead, and couldn't be happier with the results."
1,Not a helpful company!,"I bought this unit for a small retail store. It's primary purpose was to act as the router for the three computers in the store, and to access the DSL.I spent more than four hours on the phone with tech support trying to get it to communicate with the DSL unit. The tech support from my ISP was more helpful than D-Link. My ISP even tried to help me fix the settings on the D-Link unit. End result is that I have replaced the unit with one from US Robotics and it hooked right up without a hitch!D-Link's tech support tried for a while then gave up pointing the finger at my ISP, saying that the name and password had to be wrong since all of their other settings were correct. I could have accepted this, except that when we logged on without the D-Link in between the password worked fine.D-Link's tech support finally (after two days and more than four hours on the phone) admitted that the unit may not be working properly. Worst tech support I have ever experienced!"
3,unreliable,when i bought it first...it worked fine for 3 months and after than it has gone bonkers.it requires very frequent resets and doesn't respond without manual intervention.I am planning to junk it.
5,Good Wireless Router - One Year With No Problems,I purchased my DI-524 a year ago. Setup was very easy and I have had zero problems since I installed it. I have several different laptops I use with it and have had no issues. I would have no problem recommending this product to someone.
1,Problems....Problems.......,"I bought this product, and had problems with it from beginning. I contacted technical support to get me a new one. They do not issue an RMA number. They asked me to trouble shoot before they issue the RMA number. I was asked to troubleshoot the product for 40 minutes, and after that......do you know what happens? The phone gets disconnected. I called again, repeated the process ...another 40 min of troubleshooting...again phone disconnects. Third time, fortunately the phone got disconnected within 10 min......I guess the support person is going to issue the RMA number, as I almost completed their troubleshooting process.Their phone lines are too bad. Their phone lines disconnect after 20-40 min (there might be an algorithm...??? who knows). This was one of the WORST customer support I have ever seen. Want to help yourself? Do no buy this D-Link product."
5,"Easy to install, easy to configure, easy to use. :-)","I purchased this item because I didn't want to spend a lot of money. Unpacked it, followed the simple installation instruction and bingo, I was on my way to fully functional, full fledged wired Ethernet/Wireless network. I used to have a Ad-Hoc network and wanted to upgrade to a secured wireless network. In order to do that, all I had to do was to assign the network security key and that's it, in less than 5 minutes, my entire network was up and running. Originally DI-524 came with version 3.02 firmware, I upgraded it to the newest version. If you don't know anything about hex numbers, you will have to spend some time creating security key for the network Overall, I have Intel 801.X a,b,g wireless adapter in my laptop and I am able to connect at 54MBPS, OVerall, excellent features, ease of use, price to features ration. Thums up to this router."
2,Works great unless you want to use it with a 802.11b,"The router seemed easy to set up including adding a WEP for security. It turns out that although I set up a WEP through the 'wizard,' the WEP was not turned on. Calling technical support was easy and they helped fix that.The main problem was we were using two laptops with wireless cards; one with a 802.11b and one with 802.11g. Even though the packaging and the tech people said that it should work with both, we had problems with the 802.11b. After spending the weekend on the phone with tech people without solving the problem, I went online and found out that this router has problems with 802.11b.So it's a great router if you don't have mixed platforms."
2,It was cheap and it shows,"Well, I guess I got what I paid for. When I first got it, it didn't work AT ALL until I downloaded the v.1.05 firmware update. But now, it's still pretty wishy-washy. My connection gets dropped a lot and that's pretty annoying. I've been having problems with the MAC filtering especially. I'm basically just waiting for the next firmware update that will hopefully fix a lot of the problems. I'm not holding my breath though."
5,Fits my Simple Needs at Home,"I have this wireless capable router in my home, and have for about a month now. I am pleased with it's performance as I've never had to curse it out for being a bad router. :)From what I remember the installation of this router was very easy and I had zero problems. I can always check and see how the router is doing by going to it's web interface via my web browser and checking out the status page. Or the Logs. I don't always knwo what they mean, but if nothing looks out of the ordinary then I feel ok.The wireless portion of this router works pretty good to. Nice and secure, which keeps out my neighbors, the range is good in my home, I can even go outside. Overall I like this router and would recommend it to other casual computer/internet users out there. It's priced right too!"
1,"""We're not going to give you your money back.""","I am not a complainer; I have NEVER written a negative review for any product or vendor on Amazon. But D-Link is evil. This product only worked intermittently; kept dropping the signal. D-Link insisted the product worked fine and *refused* to allow a return. Direct quote: ""We're not going to give you your money back."" DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY: They make a poor product, refuse to stand behind it, and engage in shoddy business practices. Would give them a zero if I could. I should have read all the negative reviews on this site before I purchased from them."
4,Works for my simple setup,"I gave this dlink d1-524 router 4 stars because it was easy to setup and configure. I also bought the D-Link DWL-G120 Wireless 802.11g USB Adapter for another desktop machine to go with this router. Only problem I encountered was after going through the setup instructions, I couldn't get a connection to the cable modem so I read the ""troubleshooting"" section. It instructed me to turn modem off for 2 minutes, turn router off, turn router on, etc. etc. After I did this it worked!While I'm not a sophisticated user (i.e. multiple wireless clients, complex security setup needs), I would guess my setup is pretty average. For this type of user, I would recommend this router based on it's price and features (security). The user manual is very average and doesn't waste a lot of words explaining to novices what certain features are for. However, the bottom line I got my wireless network setup up on two boxes in less than 1 hour and IT WORKS! Good enough for me!"
1,Faulty router,"Like many others, I also ran into the classic problem with this router. It locks up and needs to be reset at least 2 to 3 times in a day. Plug out the power and plug in the power supply, and the router would work next few hours. At some point it gave up and would never work... !! I returned this product within a month.May be you need some luck to get the non-buggy version. It has fabulous 5 star reviews from others :-(.."
1,A router you can't count on,"The first one I bought worked great for about 14 days, then it wouldn't stay connected for more than 5 minutes. Returned it...Now the second one is starting to act up. Not sure what is wrong with these things, but avoid this model if at all possible."
1,DI-524 VPN Passthrough,"Connection to Checkpoint VPN as well as others is only partial - requires that UDP encapsulation be forced on SecureClient. Still no VPN access to Exchange Server, can't map network drives."
1,Create anything with clay,"i lost my money in this book...terrible book, in my opinion serve only for put in the shelve.that is it."
4,exciting worldly women spys,"Release MeByLinda LantermanThree very different women with strengths and goals propel this book from the mundane mystery into a high-quality thinking person's novel. From Montana to the Kona coast, the women act in exciting dissimilar ways than a reader would expect. Excitement flavored with the thrill of fishing never fails to interest this reader. A complete and twisted plot weaves the storyline until there is no guesswork from the reader. I couldn't put it down and read far into the night. If you like a stunning, complete mystery read RELEASE ME by Linda Lanterman"
1,trammps,"I have been a trammps fan since their first album and I love all the songs on this cd, but Rhino puts the edited versions on this compilation. If you want the long versions, this is not for you."
4,Pirates Card Pack/3D Pocket Model Game ...,"Fun strategy card game with neat card size plastic pop-out and assemble game pieces. My tweenage son loves them and has collected more than a few packs while still wanting more! So I would recommend them, just not to younger children – 1) the game pieces are small and can be fiddly and 2) due to the nature of the game (popping out the pieces, assembling them and disassembling them during game play) the pieces can easily snap/break if one isn’t careful."
5,Of Whales and Men a classic about a forgotten place and age!,Great historical narrative of a forgotten place and age. The age of whaling is largely forgotten today and Dr. Robertson provides a unique first hand view into the brutal lives of whalers in the mid 20th Century.
4,Strawberries Are Red,"This is a great book for a toddler learning her colors. Our 2 year old loves it, turning the pages quickly and pointing at everything! She eats everything that's illustrated in the book, so she has fun naming the fruits. A great book, and durable, because it's a board book."
1,Printing quality on this book is sub-par,Not a quality printing job on this book as I am finding out with many childrens books purchased online. Cardboard pages are also flimsier than I would like for a small child.
4,DMC-L1 7.5MP Lumix digital camera,I deleted my 3 star review after Panasonic's Service Center sent me a new lens when the Elmarit Zoom on my Lumix started to jam. Now they have sent the camera and lens back and I am happier with the camera. This camera isn't an giant megapixel SLR with the finest lens. It has an amazing lens for the money and it takes great pictures.
5,"As presented, like new body, very happy !","Beautiful camera, great seller, as advertised.I own a DMC-LC1, will never part with it and this L1K is just natural progression for me, wanted to experiment with my many older AI Nikon lenses in a digital format, for my taste this is the perfect platform to do it, so far so good, but have to learn all over again to trust my eyes and light meter, one giant and happy leap to the past !"
5,Camera Intelligently designed,"I have stayed in the non-interchangeable DSLR realm and shot film in 35mm and 6x4,5 cm formats. I have been waiting for the technology to sort itself out which it still hasn't done. The rush to mega-pixels is based on a poor understanding of the technology. Once sensor size is standardized then lens design can be optimized.. this is what the 4/3rds format is about. Mark my words-- Nikon and Canon will have to redesign lenses and while they may be backward compatable they will be under-performers. The 4/3rds format can grow-- Sigma just signed on- how about a 3CCD imager for this format- 22 MP with same size image circle from lens. Thats what I'm talking about!This camera takes great pictures, has the feel of a real camera. Add the Leica lens and some great features. It is less noisy than most 1:1/8 10 MP cameras I tested. The Image Stabilization is optical and great in action. You won't be disappointed."
4,Very useful,"We used this when planning a backpacking trip at Glacier in 2011 (we went in and out through Ptarmigan Pass). We thought it was a useful book, well written, with a good level of detail that helped us choose an appropriate route. We trusted it enough that we later bought Molvar's book for our next backpacking trip to Olympic National Park."
5,For a deep thinker,This is a wonderful book. Mine has been passed around until it is dog-eared. Missler makes the bible come alive and real. This book started a bible study and exciting things happened. A must read if you want real answers.
3,Great Stools,"Bought for my studio, not using a lot or for long times. They arent the MOST comfortable stools but they're adequate. Very light weight and the leather quality is ok. Not sure that I would want them for a kitchen and not for rough kids. Great that they are very inexpensive. Red shade is on the warm side, if that matters."
4,Captive Lover,"This was a great romance that should be read by anyone who needs a little faith in love. I will admit, I at first was hesitant, because it was another women captive who falls for her captor story, but it still worth the effort. Malik may at times seem like an unsympathetic hero, because after all he does capture innocent women and sells them into the slave trade, all under his cause of freeing a people under an evil dictatorship. Amelia was one of his captives. (...) A very satisfying romance, I would recommend it to everyone!Cyndi"
4,Excellent Book,I enjoyed this book and missed it very much!! It is a good old fashion love story that you can't seem to find alot of these days.
1,"About time, but not complete yet","Well well, it looks like those bozos at Alpha Video after a 2 year hiatus are finally releasing 2 more discs of the 1954 Sherlock Holmes series with Howard and Crawford. However this will make 36 of the 39 episodes in the series available on their label. My advice, IGNORE THIS OFFER. The Mill Creek Set of 5 discs with the entire series is now easily available including here at Amazon. Someone in their higher ups must have read my comment on it because they are now selling it for half what I paid for it. Alright I'll be more blunt, ALL 39 EPISODES FOR UNDER 10 BUCKEROOS. Get THAT set not this one. Knowing Alpha it will take another 2 years to put out Volume 10 and cross the finish line (they had the nerve to email me back then BE PATIENT, yeah right). While we're on the subject, ""Alphie"" how about the 2 Arthur Wontner Movies you haven't released yet huh?"
2,Strictly for die-hard Coward fans,"This is a very mediocre Noel Coward score. Except for "" London Is A Little Bit Of All Right"", the show is one big bore."
2,Only Tessie O'Shea shines and sings for this supper,"Whatever you do, don't buy this album. Florence Henderson is so over the top that her performance in this makes her performance in ""The Brady Bunch"" seem like Eugene O'Neill and Jose Ferrer should have been put out to pasture like the dead race horse he seemed to mimic in his singing (if anyone can call it that). And Noel Coward just didn't have it by that time in his life as can be witnessed by his other late show the cloying ""Sail Away"". Only Tessie O'Shea in an Alfred Dolittle imitation gives this funeral pyre its needed light. I wouldn't pay 24 cents for this Cowardly frey into self-delusion and self-parody."
5,Nirvana captured in the Raw.,"This book is by far the nicest Nirvana book I own. It's a beautiful, thick paperback, with fantastic rare photographs. For a long time, the only Nirvana books around were information heavy, and focused a lot on Kurt's death. This book captures exactly what they were, A great band. Pure punk rock, pure soul, pure energy. It's a wonderful memory of a great band. You'd be mad not to buy this book."
5,"If you love Nirvana, you've got yourself a book.","Not being a big fan of Nirvana, I wasn't sure what to get my sister for her birthday. My sister is a huge fan, you see, and she loves books with pictures. After searching far and wide for a book with Nirvana and pictures of Nirvana, I discovered this one.If you are looking to buy a book with photos from the days of Nirvana, then this is the one for you. Not only does over half the book contain large pictures, they are all (most, there are a few in black and white) in color, and they are rare photos that don't appear as often as most others do.This book is a great buy for the Nirvana fan. If you love Nirvana, you've got yourself a book."
1,Not worth the money,"These liners appear to work at first, but don't hold up to an overnight soaking. I recommend using Fuzzi Bunz liners instead. They really work well."
3,too thin,"Personally, I am not a fan of the Kushie diapers nor they're liners. They are really thin and I had to use 2-3 liners at night time. I prefer using the pocket diapers. They look thiner, but last just as long. I now use Banyland (from ebay), and so far, I am very happy with them."
2,Not very useful product,"Not absorbing, I have to use at least 4 layers for my 2 year old and still leaking a little bit. After a few times wash, it becomes hard and not comfortable to touch."
2,Better off getting disposable liners,"I purchased these when I was first being introduced to the cloth diapering world. Overall, I'd say if you're looking for something to minimize contact with messes, opt for a disposable liner (Amazon sells a great biodegradable, disposable liner).Just because I have them, I use them if we're leaving the house for a tad bit more absorbency in the prefolds. They certainly don't act as doublers, they only avoid having to clean small messes...not really beneficial for big blowouts."
2,"Non absorbent, just more cloth to rinse!","Just bought the kushies ultra diapers, cloth inserts, and disposable rolls. These inserts soak through and there really is no point in them. They're supposed to give an extra layer of absorbency but they don""t. If you're looking for something that you can switch out and not have to change the diaper every time (keeps the diaper dry), just get the gerber or carters cloth diapers and stick those inside folded, they absorb everything in these diapers! you can cut them down to size as well, which is what i did. they're only six bucks for a six pack at walmart."
5,good stuff,I ordered these as a doubler and read the reviews after so I am now using them as a liner (which I now realize is their intention) in my pocket diapers to save from some stains. With them being so inexpensive I think they will do the job and I can always order more if they fall apart. Better than disposable liners.
3,Not that great,"Bought these in hopes of saving my brand new cloth diapers. I really wanted something to line the inside of his diapers from his poop (I'm breastfeeding and it stains things sometimes) so I bought these hoping I could use them just as a liner, didn't care about it absorbing the pee. Disapointed in the product. When you first take them out of the package they are the perfect size and the perfect thickness. After just one wash (Hand washables cycle warm wash/cold rinse and Delicate dry) they shrunk to a very small size and are very thin. I haven't used them yet so I don't know how absorbant they are, just disapointed they turned out to be so small after one wash."
2,Not worth the money,"Unless you want something extra to rinse off after your little one poops, don't bother buying these. They are too narrow for the BG 3.0s that I use, so the poop spreads off the edges. I've used two at a time overlapping eachother, and that helps. When my son eats more solids and his poo isn't so runny, they may be more useful. However, since I like the wicking properties of the liner in his BGs, I won't be using these anymore."
1,Worst inserts ever,I thought I'd give them a try even if given bad comments and i was wrong.....they are too small and to thin. Waste of money!
1,Disappointed,"These diaper liners are too small for any normal size cloth diaper. They are cheap which is why I ordered them, but I should have known that you get what you pay for. Spend the extra money for the higher quality inserts. The thickness is fine, but the length is way too short, I would guarantee leaks with these liners."
2,beware: not a liner but an add on,I guess I didn't check into these carefully enough. They are not liners but extra liners for Kushies AIO.
3,Inexpensive and useful,"The bad:- Don't expect these liners to act as diaper doublers; they just aren't that absorbent. They seem thick enough when you first take them out of the package, but a few washes later they're thinner, smaller, and a bit bald.- They will stain.The good:- They're crazy cheap when compared to similar products.- They're washable, so you can just chuck them in the pail with the rest of the diaper when they're just wet, rather than make a trip to the bathroom for a flush.- It's much easier to shake/rinse poo off of one of these liners than off of a whole diaper.- They do increase the absorbency of your diaper a little bit. Apparently, some other users have found it helpful to fold them. I prefer their use as a liner, so folding would be counter-productive.- Your baby isn't wearing these on the outside, so who cares if they're stained?- You may not have to go to a cloth diapering specialty boutique to buy them. I've seen them at Wal-mart and Babies 'R Us."
5,Great Reusable Diaper Liners,"I use these liners in every pair of clean diapers I put on my daughter. They absorb urine well and are easy to rinse after a bowel movement. I prefer these to disposable liners because they provide an extra layer of absorbency. After a couple months use, they have not discolored and work as effectively as when they were new."
4,Decent liners for protecting your diaper,"I purchased these because I wanted a liner that would help prevent staining on my expensive diapers. I wasn't expecting these to act as a doubler. (They definitely would NOT work for extra absorbency by the way.) They do the trick for keeping my diapers stain free and make messy clean-ups easier.They are a low-cost in comparison to other liners, so that is a plus. They're not as soft as I'd like them to be and mine shrank quite a bit, but they're a decent product for the price."
4,"clean easily, but shrink a little","all of mine have shrunk after their first washing and seem extremely worn out for just a few washings each (they've only been washed maybe 10 or 20 times each so far - and I've never used bleach on them), but they do a good job for overnight cloth diapering or for saving the diaper itself from too much soil (poop) stains."
5,nature's logic,thought I would try this product with my 3 finicky cats to upgrade their diet nutritionally from the commercial cat food that I can afford to buy. wanted to try better quality wet food but it's cost prohibitive so I bought this. all 3 actually like it and eat the whole can of food--usually I'm throwing out some of it the next morning. will keep using this product because I feel better about feeding commercially while boosting their nutrition; plus they like it!!!!!
2,Too chewy,2 1/2Starts off promising enough with just enough tropicalia to keep the electronica engaging though soon enough falls into generic territory and never quite recovers from its sun-drenched predictability.
1,Worse than useless as a guide to understanding color--,"The big negative is in Willard's explanations of how to neutralize saturated (bright ) colors. He recommends black!!! I think this neutralizes any of the book's positives, given that it is teaching color theory and this is the cardinal sin of colorists--using black to neutralize!!! For a much better, truly scientific and sensible explanation of using colors, try ""Blue and Yellow Don't make Green,"" by Michael Wilcox--this is ground-breaking, easy to follow, and actually works, unlike Willard's book which will lead you astray. Nice paintings though."
5,Very Good,"If you want to hear some good mid sixties pop psychedelic proto-punk rhythm and blues stones-influenced garage band music, this is it.I wish these songs were not so short. Looks like many are 45 rpm releases. Imagine what these guys would have done if they could have stretched out.The guitar breaks are great and really ahead of their time. Some sound like versions of later Quicksilver leads, some sound like Keith Richards stuff off the first album, some are blusy, some are fuzzed out and generally they are leads that really stand up to the test of time.The drummer and base are really solid with flashes here and there of that little extra that make them more than average. Sometimes that drummer does a kind of Keith Moon thing for a few bars.I think fans of Brian Jonestown Massacre will also really dig this because this is the kind of thing that group so often borrows from and pays homage to.Great band."
3,I Feel Awful,"I've watched every episode of Midsomer Murders several times over. I liked this one as well, but not as much, and not just because Tom Barnaby leaves the series. His retirement seemed tacked on at the end. He just didn't seem to have enough motivation to take such a huge step. It seemed phony, done in a hurry. I think the writers should have showd us more of TB's internal process -- maybe even over two episodes. I found myself quite unsatisfied with the episode. Still, it's Midsomer after all, so 3 stars. I feel doubly awful -- first because of the poorly constructed episode, and second because I have to dock my favorite series two stars."
4,A nasty sort of fun,"The formatting is a little off, the colors are wack at times, and it leans to crudeness. If you're looking to find meaningful insights into astrology, you will be disappointed in this. The summaries dig jokes at the the more unpleasant aspects of Zodiac personalities, often in extremes. If you can't handle that, it's not for you. At all.But if you can laugh at yourself and your friends, it's a hilarious read."
2,Whatever,I couldn't get into this book so much so to the point that I took it back the day after I bought it. The pages are glossy and colorful which is probably what drew me to the book in the first place but the information is stuff that I all read and heard before. Nothing that they said about my sign (Aries) offended me it just bored me.
2,"Accurate, but save your money and buy better.","If you are familiar with Stella Hyde's writing, you will know why I said accurate, but save your money. If you are not familiar, please know that she writes words but does not say anything. The accurate parts are the parts that can be understood. I do not know who taught this woman English, but it cannot be someone who was alive in the past 100 years.Her other book, Snarling Tiger, Hidden Dragon was even worse! If you are a serious student of Astrology, go to an actual store and browse thru their books, then order it cheaper from Amazon (unless you can get it elsewhere, I can get a lot of books from 2 other suppliers at wholesale prices)."
2,"Very pretty, but not all that interesting","As aesthetically appealing as this book is, there are many more informative sources of information out there and many of them with far more humour.This would make a great present (I gifted my copy away), but it's not worth buying as an addition to your shelf."
2,Basics are Correct-Does not go into any depth,"This book seems to have been written with the help of the internet. Every sign's basic attributes are very correct. However, this book is only 20% basic attributes. The author appears to have tried to analyze the signs based on their basic attributes in order to find out what is bad about them. Unfortunately they analyze it very wrong.My friends and I tend to read this book and laugh due to it's flaws. If you want a good astrology book for the very basics of basics then get this book, and disregard everything else. If you want a book that is essentially correct and that you can trust buy something else. I suggest, ""Everyday Astrology"" or any book by Linda Goodman."
3,stick blender,Works well; I have another with variable speed capabilities by Braun which I prefer. This one only has one speed.
4,perfect,this is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted something that did not come from animals and its perfect
3,"Soothing, but doesn't absorb","Just beware that this doesn't absorb. It's got a balm-like consistency, and will end up on whatever clothing you put on after you apply. The relief may be worth it to you, but just wanted to point that out."
5,A must have for breastfeeding moms,"I am a first time mom and really wanted to breastfeed. Of course after reading and hearing from friends about how much pain your nipples go through I was worried about how successful I would be. However my baby now latches on great and this product protects the nipple from baby and pumping perfectly.What I love:It's all natural, no need to wipe off before pumping or feeding.It makes your breast and nipple feel great. Moisturized and protectedIt has a very mild smellMUCH better than any other product I have tried.GREAT for pumping. I apply to my entire breast area prior to pumping. It protects the whole area.Use before and after feedings."
1,bad texture - very grainy,"I exchanged my first tube of this because it was very runny and grainy, I assumed it was a bad batch or got exposed to heat during delivery. The second tube had the same problem so I returned it. The exchange and return were easy with Amazon. I ended up buying a third tube from my hospital where their sample was very creamy and smooth. However, the tube I bought had the same grainy texture as those from Amazon so I can't use it. I wouldn't recommend this stuff although dealing with amazon is no problem."
2,Didn't work so well for me--but smelled nice!,"I really think you have to try lots of different products and see what works for you. This one was grainy and just didn't give me a whole lot of relief. The stuff that worked for me was the Medela Tender Care and MotherLove. That said, to each her own! This might work great on someone else."
4,great addition to lanolin,"This cream is great, i needed the lanolin at first, but this cream is great for later use and is better to keep in the baby bag because it is not as greasy as lanolin and doesn't stick to your hands like crazy."
3,I preferred Lanolin,I bought this and the hospital gave me some lanolin and I preferred using the lanolin. The lanolin provided more moisture protection. My nipples get really dry and raw feeling.
2,didn't get me started at all!,"I was expecting this book to show me somewhere in the first hundred pages an example of how to create an RSS feed. Instead I got wayyyy too much history, and I couldn't find a ""hello, world"" example.I grant that the history is important, and this book will probably fit in well to the cadre of books that emerge on RSS over the next year or two. However, this year, this isn't the book I needed."
3,"Solid book, but not great","This is a solid book, and worth having on your bookshelf. I was a bit suprised at it's relative thinness (178 pages less appendices), but it certainly contained a lot of information. I also found some minor problems with the book -- e.g., chapter 4 is titled RSS 0.91, 0.92, and 2.0 (Really Simple Syndication), but doesn't talk about RSS 2.0 at all.Overall, It's a solid book with a few warts. I'll certainly get some use out of it, but I hope the second edition is a bit smoother."
3,"Good book, but a little wordy","RSS is just XML in a certain format. At its core, it's pretty basic.The author goes into MUCH detail about the history of the format as well as older (and nowdays rarely used) RSS versions.It was interesting reading the history, and the details on the format and extentions was great. It really helped me get up to speed on RSS.I would like to have seen more discussion about what RSS could do though. If I was consulting the author on the 2nd version, I'd have suggested dropping the info about older formats and putting some info in about the new uses of RSS...like iPodder, or the Presidential debate feeds.If you want to get started quickly, this is a good way to jump in."
4,dahons 2000 miles,"We did some modifications and used this haul our Dahons 1900 miles last year. It worked to hold our fold up bikes by the tires rather then the top rail (our bikes dont have). Bikes are much easier to secure vs. a hanging type rack. Could be a bit heavier duty for full size bikes and the adjustments could have knobs so you dont need to take wrenches with you. Could come with adaptor to use in 2"" or 1 1/4 hitch. Those items would make it 5 star but price was perfect for us to modify."
4,It works,"This works for me because I use it with my Truck and when I use my travel trailer, I unbolt the cross bars and bolt them onto the pull-out bike carrier on my Montana. It works great."
1,If only I could give negative stars...,"To compare this film to Hitchcock is like comparing Jennifer Aniston's acting skills to Meryl Streep's, although Jennifer's acting is much better than the actors in this film. There went an hour and 22 minutes of my life I can never get back..."
5,Great Band!,"This great band has been around for more than 20 years, to my knowledge this is the first live album in that time. Many of the rehearsal bands don't jell well as an ensemble and lack fire and swing, not the case with this band. Clayton's writing is creative and fresh. The band is grounded by an incredible rhythm section. The piano player is just as strong as the more well known Hamilton and Clayton. Solo work is mature and creative. As good as the Big Phat band is, the Clayton/Hamilton band is a lot deeper in its writing."
1,Turns Orange,"Pros-Smells great, moisturizing and it does give a subtle colorCons-The color however is on the orange side so it isn't all that different from other products(self-tanners) on the market and I would not describe it as a ""glow"" I would describe it as slightly orange color.Jergens Natural Glow works much better amd actually gives a natural looking glow and I highly recommend that instead. It does leave a slight shimmer, which may not be something everyone would like. They have a product for your face or you could just use the body lotion. It actually does give a healthy natural looking glow that doesn't look orange."
4,Worth the work to read,"I would love to see a revised version someday. Until then, this book will help you discover how to implement a model that will work in the Sunday School hour that will:1. help your people connect with each other,2. provide the challenging biblical content they need to grow3. and provide the needed care to make sure people don't slip through the cracks.In my occasionally humble opinion, this is definitely not the best written book you'll every read. BUT it's worth the work to get to the principles inside. Another reviewer recommended the Connecting Church. By all means, buy and read it. It is a great book. BUT that author's purpose only overlaps a little with the ABF philosophy. If you are not already familiar with the model, the ABF Book will give you the tools you need to challenge, connect and care for your people.[...]"
3,Re: Knute Larson's Book,"I know Pastor Knute Larson. I used to attend his church, The Chapel, for many years while living in Akron Ohio. All I can say I was severely persecuted while attending there. I'm sure Mr. Larson wrote many good things in his book but in actuality those same ABF's he's so fond of did their very best to send me the message I was not welcome there. Either at the ABF's I was attending (Doug Clark was the Pastor of the one I was attending) or at The Chapel.All I can say The Chapel is not the place for poor people. I caters to the well-to-do and affluent. I was not welcome there all the years I attended. Afterall I did ""lowly"" work. I was no ""professional"" like most of the members/attendees of The Chapel.Perhaps one may gleam some good things out of Knute Larson's book. But his church tells a completely different story indeed."
2,IT'S NOT HAPPING.I DON'T LIKE IT!!,"THE PRODUCT WAS'T WHAT I HAD IN MINE.I SOME PEOPLE WOULD LIE,BUT THATS NOT ME.IT CAN'T CATCH IT STATIONS AND THE CASSETTE OPENS AND CLOSE TO SLOW.THE SOUND IS'T AT IT'S BEST!! I THINK THIS PRODUCT NEEDS SOME WORK.I WAS GOING TO SEND IT BACK BUT MY GIRL NEEDED FOR A TRIP.SHE DON'T EVEN USE IT ANY MORE!! WASTE OF MONEY...BUT YOU DO HAVE STUFF I CAN USE AND I WILL KEEP BUYING FROM YOU."
4,My find,Once again I found what I was looking for. Thank You!GOD BLESS AND KEEP YOU ALL ALWAYS!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Buyer beware,"No remote control (for muting the device from across the room when the phone rings) and no returns (once I realized no remote control). The controls are fairly complicated...in fact, finding the Power button takes a bit of scanning as it is an obscure switch in the middle of many other switches. Not intuitive....and also not returnable.Not recommended unless you a desperate. Tuner is satisfactory and speakers are OK (presuming you don't want concert quality)."
2,Tape player needs improvement,"The tape player slows down and speeds up. On the plus side, high speed dub recording can produce regular tapes, but don't count on this one for a regular tape player or double player just for listening. The CD player works nice but why not leave it out? You can find that any place else you want."
2,BoomBox purchase review,"I had a BoomBox that finally conked out on me, that's what prompted me to purchase a new one hoping to get one exactly like the one I had. So I was very disappointed, when I found that it did not have an on/off button. In order to shut it off it is necessary to unplug the Box. If I would have known it did not have an on/off button I would not have purchased it. It came from China, so they must have different codes than we have. Another convenience my other Box had was that I could hook up multple speakers to it. This one has only two plug-ins for its 2 speakers. I could not discern from the photos whether these features were there. I am not mad at Amazon.com, because China is the one that messed up. Are there any electrical devices built in the USA, that do not have an on/off button or switch?"
3,Recording problem,"The cassette-to-cassette dubbing works well. The cassette recording feature has a serious flaw. I cannot record from a CD onto an audio cassette without the mike picking up outside noises, like barking dogs, sirens, and people talking, plus a loud motor hum. I need to record hymn accompaniments from CDs to a single cassette for evening chuch service, since we have no organist. I must still use my elderly Sony since the new machine produces unusable tapes."
1,Can I still return it?,"Hardly used the item, bought for summer use, then was ill and finally tried to use it. The tape player broke the first time we tried using it. The CD player dosen't play any of our CD's and then we tried using the radio and mostg recently, the tuner button is stuck and can't get my radio station. I wish I never bought it, can I please return it."
5,Supersonic Portable CD PLayer with Cassette Recorder (S-2020),I was looking for something compact and this is perfect for my desk. I also was looking to record both voice and music and this can be both. It was a good deal for the money. It is also a nice looking machine.
4,good system for the price,i purchased this for my cousin. he enjoys it and finds everything working superbly. he was impressed with the duel cassettes as well as the cd and radio no remote but still a good buy.
1,Very Disappointed,I bought this boombox for my husband in May for his birthday. He used it very little. It has been only 5 months and the antenna broke off while moving it to get a football game to come in clearer. Today we tried to play a Cassette and the Cassette player isnt working at all. The only thing that now works on this boombox after 5 months is the cd player. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.Supersonic SC-2020 Portable CD Player with Cassette Recorder & AM/FM Radio
1,Looks good but doesn't work,"Unfortunately this is not a good machine at all. The CD didn't work, the radio was static on all stations. Didn't bother trying the cassette player. It's being returned. It looks good though, they did like the look of it so I guess that is a plus somewhere."
3,Portable Music Center,"We bought this Portable Recorder/Player to practice with and use in various locations. All the functions work properly and the speakers have good sound quality, but when you turn the volumn there's a lot of scratching noise and the CD Player is way too sensitive. The slightest vibration of movement makes it skip or boggle the song. It won't play the same CD very long before it starts repeating and stopping or skipping that. When pushing the Cassette Buttons for playing or recording there's a lot of scratching noise and distortion in the play back. We were not completely satisfied with it for the price we paid, but we kept it and use it anyway."
1,Not Good,This is not worth owning. One time playing and the Cassett part quits. Drags and very inferior sound. No remote. The radio does not pull in any station clearly. I would not recommend this item to anyone.
2,The CD player doesn't work!!!,Everything about the boombox is ok except for the cd player which it won't play. I was conned seriously. I need to buy another boombox and I'm pissed!
5,Hitachi Rotary Hammer,"Prior to my actual purchase of this tool I did extensive research on other brands that were in the same price range and this one seemed to have better reviews along with better performance. In actual use it performed as expected especially in the hammer/drill mode in drilling holes in concrete. Very quick, smooth and little, if any vibration through the handle. In switching to the hammer only mode with a flat spade bit it did only an adequate job of breaking up concrete thus it is by no means a substitute for a true demolition hammer.The one thing that I didn't appreciate is that Hitachi has too many models that appear to be very similar in appearance and in the same price range. It made it difficult to actually determine exactly which model I really wanted to purchase"
3,"Drilling was fine, but chiseling made it whine","Product worked great initially for both drilling into concrete and chiseling off a very small area of fragile, old-fashioned stucco. Low vibration, and effective. Then all of a sudden it felt like a gear slipped, there was grease coming out By moving from reverse to forward and back, it slipped back into gear, but something was still not right as the chisel bit did not stay locked in position. Waiting to find out on repair options."
2,Not satisfied,"It works fine at the beginning then it slipped. It's ok for small bit, slip for bits size above 3/8""."
3,Not what I thought.,"No,it's not at all interesting to me,let alone my 4th grader.I can just google for some writing prompts rather than buying this book and letting it stand in the shelf.There are no ""how to do"" lessons in this book.Disappointed, even surprised and couldn't believe that the whole is bunch of writing prompts with some suggestions. I thought it would get better by the end of the book,but not.There is no structural development for the student to learn from this book."
3,Not bad,This is a generally good book. I like that it spends a little more time on some of the concepts that are generally difficult for students.
5,A book your children will love!,"My son LOVES this book! With the new Harry Potter books, my son (a 10-year-old who normally hates to read and write) has taken an interest in trying to write his own books. As a non-writer I did not know where to start, but Ms. Miller's book is informative and most of all FUN! She demystifies writing so that it is enjoyable and understandable. I would suggest anyone with schoolage children try this book so writing will not be such a scarey thing for their kids. I read it and learned lots -- I wish I had it when I was growing up!"
3,50 Writing Lessons that Work,"This is good for students who need focus, but not for students who need basic skills."
5,absolutely excellent introduction to VRML,"After reading this book cover to cover, I felt the following: The book is clearly written. It provides an absolutely excellent introduction to VRML. It follows a logical step by step progression. ""sams net"" should be proud of this one. This is the best introduction to VRML I have seen on the market."
4,Teach Yourself VRML 2 in 21 Days,Very good and easy to understand. VRML is so much fun to make graphics.
3,Brings to Light and Interesting and Important Topic,"I've seen a handful of movies from this group of people, but only one by this actual director. I think I preferred this one a bit to his other movie, Hannah Takes the Stairs.It definitely brings to light an interesting and important topic, being too connected and plugged in via the phones and computers (which I suspect might be me right now). And this movie is a good example of maybe what not to do! It depicts strained relationships and ones left unexplored because of technology as a distraction and interference.My favorite parts of the movie were the montages of mouth sounds that are cut together to make music (by one of the characters.) I couldn't get enough of it! I also liked the montages of camera phone pictures played to voice mails. Beautiful stuff."
3,Not Swanberg's best,"...but still, hilarious, heartbreaking and full of great moments. Kevin Bewersdorf (Swanberg's usual composer) shines in the lead and should get more roles in Joe's films. He was great in “Uncle Kent” too. This is also one of Bewersdorf's best scores for a Swanberg film, and it's available for download at the official site. You should give it a try.The Benten Films package is exquisite and I'm in love with those guys after purchasing this and Aaron Katz's “Quiet City”/“Dance Party USA” combo. They put so much attention to detail and they actually care about the films, the whole package is almost like a collectible item."
2,Low budget & different,The problem with this movie is that it doesn't give you a good reason to care about the characters. I did like how some of the video work was done but you can tell this is low budget. That doesn't mean it is bad but it isn't ground breaking either. I did enjoy the main character's interesting music. He was also the best actor in this movie.Definitely not your typical flick. I found the concept intriguing but a bit long for what it is. Still it is kind of an interesting film but I don't need to see it again. I found it to be somewhat of a depressing film yet I think that was the intention. It's quite a commentary on some people's addiction to technology.This has adult situations and not for children.
1,Limited Information,"I was actually very disappointed with this book. It offers just a VERY short, half-page synopsis of each clan and then a photo of their primary tartan. Better information can be found on the internet as well as access to several other versions of clan tartans; most clans have more than one tartan (eg. ancient, modern, weathered, etc). If you are the type who wants an overview of every clan, you might like this, but if you want detailed information about a specific clan, you will not find it here."
5,One of the Best!,"This is one of the best Maynard CDs out there. ""Take the 'A' train"" is great. Maynard is amazing. I love this CD."
3,"Solid, but not Fantastic","This album is a good illustration of both the strengths and weaknesses of Maynard's style. He is certainly a great jazz legend and jazz educator, but whether this album is an unqualified masterpiece is something else. I have seen him live before, and I was very impressed by that experience, but still, his music has a bit too much pop and not enough raw substance. Maynard can certainly go octaves above mere mortals, but when it comes to actual content in his solos, he is easily upstaged by mny other fine jazz trumpeters, i.e. Clifford Brown, Dizzy Gillespie, Wynton Marsalis, Freddie Hubbard, etc., and even his own bandmates. Though he is a great ambassador for jazz, his music lacks, to a degree, maturity, which is very much in evidence on this album."
3,Cute but heavy,"I really like the look of the holder, but it made my purse so heavy I had to take it out and leave it on my desk."
1,LA TRAYECTORIA 2,I SILL NOT RECEIVING THE CD BACK. I DID PAY FOR THIS CD AND I BEEN SEND THE WRONG CD BUT I STIL WAITING SO PLEASE IF IS ANY WAY THE I CAN GET MY MONEY BACK OR THE CORRECT CD. THANKS
5,Classic New Wave,"A strong entry in the ""New Wave Hits"" series, Volume 9 contains some of the best known songs of the era. ""Melt with You"", ""Blister in the Sun"" and ""Save it for Later"" are early 80's anthems. Duran Duran's ""Rio"" and ABC's ""Poison Arrow"" were huge MTV hits. Each of these tunes will be immediately familiar to anyone who grew up in the early 80's. Also worthy are Marshall Crenshaw's ""Whenever You're on My Mind"" and ""Love My Way"", a classic from the Psychedelic Furs. Once again, Rhino is to be commended for keeping alive the great music of a bygone era. Thirtysomethings who actually experienced this fun, upbeat music will no doubt love this collection. Sure beats the heck out of today's ""music"". Highly recommended."
5,Tremendous hit singles and timeless memories from the 80's.,"One of the best compilations across the whole Just Can't Get Enough New Wave Hits collection, filled up with tremendous hit singles and timeless memories from the 80's. Q-Feel's Dancing In Heaven (Orbital Be-Bop) is, for me, simply the song that could probably define the sound of the entire decade.Shame Rhino has cut the length of the songs, not only on this volume but throughout the entire series, as they did also with the Billboard Hits collection before...This is, however, a must for anybody who's grown up listening and enjoying the lifting music of the 80's, and a highly recommended for any New Wave neophyte."
3,2nd Edition is Dated,I was required to use this book (2nd edition) for a class at American Sentinel University. The book is dated but still has useful information. It covers all major areas of networking briefly. I found the book to be a bit boring but I am sure it will be a decent reference book. Unless you have to buy this book for school I would recommend skipping it. I am giving this book three stars because it has useful information and lots of hands on activities. Two plus years ago it would be 4.5 stars. I really like the Thomson Course Technology books but this one is just too dated.
5,Works on Kindle Fire HD,This is just what I needed when my professor changed the book in our class. Works great on my Kindle.
3,semi erotic,the film is stories of 6 different women who are in there upper thirties and attractive. The stories are shallow. it is OK but nothing to rave about.
1,no es lo que pedi ni lo que esta en el dibujo,el dibujo que muestran es exactemente el repuesto que estoy buscando pero al recibirlo me doi cuenta que no lo es como puede ser que en el dibujo tenga en total 5 botones y en el objeto que compre tienen en total 8 botones creo que no lo tenian y al notenerlo mandaron otro articulo parecido....muy mala calidad en la compra ya que no es lo que compre
5,The best yet...,"I love Kaskade. I keep missing his live sets as Im a bartender and I always seem to be working when he comes to town.This CD is great. Usually there are a few songs that dont quite cut it but this one starts strong and keeps going all the way through. I especially like ""Dont Give Up"" and the two hits ""Here I Am"" and ""Everything"". Highly recommended."
5,Get your groove Om....,Terrific release from the folks @ OM and a great introduction to Kaskade's 'kapabilities' as a spinster. Every song naturally flows into the other and there are some nice sonic surprises across the album.
4,"OM + Kaskade = Delicious Deep House, West Coast Style","4.5 STARS! This album is another great OM product, and a Kaskade one at that. Life w/o Kaskade...well, please don't let me imagine it! And while I don't like this CD quite as much as Kaskades non-compilation efforts, ""It's You, It's Me"" and ""In the Moment"", this a simply not to be missed for any lover of house music. It certainly starts out strong with what is now one of my favorite house tracks ever, ""Here I Am"". Love the vocalist, love the music. It is David Morales, who I also love, but sounds 100% Kaskade. There are may other awesome tracks here, including:1. Here I Am3. Don't Give It Up7. Everything9. Cookys11. I Knew You When13. Once In a LifetimeGuess I didn't like the even numbered tracks as well, though those were generally very solid as well. There were a few slightly lackluster tracks on this album, but all in all it is a very satifying listen, especially late at night or on the weekends."
1,Let's make a movie. Let's get chicks.,"This is a great bad movie. It's kind of like a high school production of the Thriller video...Insomnia is a funny thing sometimes...gives you a chance to watch bad movies on the internet that you might never get a chance to see otherwise. This one is hilariously bad...bad writing, bad acting, dumb zombies, dumber ""zombie bait"", beautiful location, attractive cast. One of my favorite quotes was ""He has as much courage as his Dad. His Dad was also courageous...and brave."" (Turns out his Dad was the President...turned into a zombie). This isn't really worth watching unless you have some time to really waste...but a really bad movie is so much more entertaining than an hour of American Idol...and much more memorable.I hope the production of this movie worked for the guys that made it...that they ""got some chicks"" and somehow made all this worthwhile. This movie is a great bad movie...really funny for all the reasons they never meant for it to be funny."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!!!!,"I have never written a review before. This movie was so bad that it moved me to warn other people to save your money and your time. The acting was horrible at best, the special effects were missing. The camera they used was something like that of a 7-11 type security camera. I think the purchase price of the dvd cost more than the movie did to make. I forced myself to watch the whole thing as punishment for spending the money. I gave the movie a 1 star because the system would not let me rate it 0 stars like it should be."
2,Forced To Write A (Truthful) Review,"Ok, so I was just gonna watch the movie, keep my thoughts to myself and get on with my life... until I saw some pretty outlandish reviews. I thought, ""Those poor zombie-lovin' folks are gonna fall right into that trap of thinking this is a great movie unless someone stops them!"" Someone's gotta set the record straight.""The Rising Dead"" is your basic low-budget zombie flick and like so many others, falls prey to the same elements, over and over again. The shaky acting, the thin, drawn-out script, etc. ""Fast paced action""? It's about as fast-paced as a lullaby. I will be honest, the movie does boast an attractive cast, and I will give them points for their attempt at special effects. Also, filming in the lush tropical jungle was nice but don't be deceived. ""The Rising Dead"" probably won't make any Top 10 Lists."
4,they work,these handles work for my need all though they are a bit long. but i had a hard time finding the shorter ones for my camper that's over twenty years old they have been installed in my camper for a couple of months now and have held up.
5,Makes your heart sing!,This is a wonderful CD. The entire performance is absolutely perfect. Its the first Christmas CD we listen to every year and now my children start asking to hear it around Thanksgiving. I can't count the number of people I've given this to as a gift. We're are on our second copy!
5,One of my favorite Christmas CDs,"Oh my, this is just one of my absolute favorite Christmas CDs. It has a wonderful variety of music on it, with excellent musicians. Kathleen Battle, Frederica von Stade, and Winton Marsalis just shine on this CD. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves music, especially classical."
5,uplifting,"I saw this broadcast in 1991 or 1992 and have it on video. My only regret is that the concert is not available as a DVD, because the wonder is as much in the impassioned and dramatic 'conversations' between the three stars as in the sounds they produce. Still, until then, this is unforgettable stuff."
1,The worst music in the universe,"Stop that okay? It's really disgusting and disgrace. And God's mistake too. How can they call it music? Oh gosh! some blond hair, some black hair, do they have no money to dye their hair? Music, huh? I think call them trash is better. I feel pity over them."

5,This is the best cd the Moffatts have ever released to fans.,"I love the Moffatts and this is the best cd they've ever completed. It has so many new songs and the enhanced part is the best.
