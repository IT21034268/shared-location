1,Fried immediately after arrival,"Poor quality control. The unit worked for a minute or two, then a smell of overheated electronics ... dead."
1,"It should'a worked, but it didn't!","I followed the very brief instructions and printed a two page document, that is I printed 1 and 1/2 pages of it. On the second try it only printed 1/2 of the first page. In both cases the message came up stating that my computer was unable to communicate with my HP printer. I never had that problem before and I haven't had it since I removed the hub. There's always a reason that something is discounted so much!"
1,Piece of junk,"A total piece of junk. Worked for about 6 weeks, then died. Now I have to go through the time and expense of sending the thing back, getting a replacement, and hoping that the new one works better. I'm not holding my breath. Buy something else!!!!"
1,Not so great for iMac,"I've had some trouble with this hub on my iMac. Sometimes the iMac doesn't ""see"" the hardware plugged into the hub. I have to unplug and plug in again... other times, my iMac freezes up or just doesn't recognize the keyboard or mouse (which aren't plugged into the hub). This may not be related to the hub, but others have had similar problems once they get a hub."
1,Problems with Windows 2000,Same problems as others. The machine hangs up while rebooting. I have to unplug it to reboot the machine and then plug it in. It doesn't even work with my Webcam (Intel PC Camera Pro). Guess I made a Bad choice when I bought it. Stay away from it!!
1,WARNING!,"All I can do is offer a warning about this product, When I bought this product it some how cut off the connection to my keyboard."
1,What? No color?,"I've been a fan of Kenneth Patchen's work since I purchased two of his picture poem post cards at an antique store way back in 1970 for .15 cents each. I especially love his use of color, so you can imagine my shock when I received ""The Walking Away World"" in the mail and discovered ALL of the picture poems in this book are printed in black-and-white!!! I have just placed an order for another Patchen book, ""What would we do without us?"" and I'm hoping this one is in color. At least the description of this book mentions the vibrant colors of his pictures. I did not see any mention in the description of ""the Walking Away World"" that all the prints are in black-and-white. I will be returning the ""Walking Away..."" book for a refund. It's just not right! What a slap in the face for the late, great Mr. Patchen."
4,No color is a disappointment - but this is a LOT of Patchen,"I have been a fan even longer than the first reviewer, since 1959 when I first heard him on ""Cool Bill"" in Denver and subsequently found his books in a musty old bookstore.I was also VERY disappointed...if only they had charged a little more, printed a little less or at least printed SOME pages in color, it wouldn't feel so bleak...but you know, Patchen is bleak even in the middle of joy and I am happy to have all these delightful and insightful thoughts and visions from an author beginning to get his due. I'm giving it four stars to jack up the overall rating. There, I admit it. I would give it a 2 for no color but a 5 for the book being just chock full of Kenneth Patchen."
1,Disappointed,"This album is full of very difficult music and unfortunately, Gigliotti was not capable of doing the music justice. He just doesn't have the ability that he had in the past on this album and it shows throughout. Tuning is a problem, runs are unclean, and expression is minimal. The Argento is a mildly amusing work and has some musical value. The Rochberg on the otherhand is garbage. If I wanted to hear Mozart and Berlioz excerpts, I would have bought something else. It's no wonder Philadelphia didn't record the work. They knew it wasn't a ""keeper"". Long story short, save your money."
2,Problemas de formato,"Desafortunadamente, existen problemas de formato. No se si esta edicion es tan buena como sugiere la portada del libro, pero ciertamente no es muy agradable de leer el libro con todos los parrafos y oraciones quebrados. Ademas de ser un libro de dominio publico y de haber una edicion kindle gratis sin problemas de formato, no se explica ni justifica el precio. Por lo menos incluyan un estudio o la informacion en Wikipedia (como hacen con otros libros) . Aunque ""Zalacain"" nos retrata el mundo vasco, no creo que haya sido escrito en euskera. Por lo mismo no cabe hablar de traduccion, sino mas bien de transcripcion, pero de eso ya hemos comentado."
3,Repacking known concepts,"Although well written, this book repacks already known concepts. Expectations analysis have been used for a long time on competing approaches. David Young and Stephen O'Byrne have already shown this idea onEVA and Value-Based Management: A Practical Guide to Implementation. Anyway, the book is useful as a reference for Finance practioneers."
2,Good basic info but boring and redundant,"This book does a good job in covering the concepts of instructional design, but I hated how they quoted the same professionals in the field over and over again throughout the book. They should interview a wider range of ID professionals to appear more rigorous."
1,Wires break with VERY little force,"Cheap, thats the best definition. can't say how well they work because out of 3 of them every one of them fell apart in one day. I don't exercise, run with them or work in them. Just at the computer, one tiny tug...DEAD."
4,4+,"These are very good for the price, they fit well and come with extra different sized rubber ear fittings. So you can't go wrong for the price. I have them at work, they don't mess up my hair and they are easy to slip off one or both ears if someone comes to talk to me, I can just rest them on my shoulders. They are stiff, no flexibility, the sound is okay, it seems to change with my songs, how they were recorded. I'm not a techy guru, so my needs are met."
3,"Good sound, materials could be better.","The wire attachment frayed after about 9 months of wearing a few times a week, but the sound on these was very good, in fact better than the slightly more expensive jwin ones I got later. Ear-buds were a little too hard, for me. But the price was worth having these as an extra pair in a pinch."
4,"Comfortable, inexpensive","The sound quality is very good and, unlike with ear buds, you ears won't 'burn' afterwards! The only downside is you cannot lean back in a high chair. Otherwise, a very good purchase."
2,Died quickly,These headphones were ok. Unfortunately they only lasted about a month before the left side died. Sound quality wasn't great. If you are looking for a cheap pair go with Sony MDR-J10. I bought those as well and they have lasted over a year with no problems
1,What were they thinking?,"While the sound is excellent for cheap headfones, the ear buds are literally prongs that stick uncomfortably into your ear canals. I suffered for about a half hour and tossed them into the trash."
1,Terrible.,"Picked these up from a local shop for about $7 because I needed something cheap while listening to a podcast on the bus. On trying this headphone I don't know why it's even for sale!Two problems:1. They hurt! The behind-the head portion is like a big spring that holds it to your head. The in-the-ear pieces are shaped like little bullets that are pushed into your ear where it is painful. Look carefully at the picture of the guy on the packaging... he's grimacing out of pain! (seriously!)2. The 3.5mm plug is poorly made and doesn't fit properly in my mp3 player's jack. Several other headphones fit fine in my mp3 player and just to verify, the headphone jack also fit quite loosely in other headphone jacks.DO NOT BUY THIS HEADPHONE. If someone gives you a set for free, turn it down."
4,I bought a second pair.,"I've purchased a number of: headphones, behind-the-neck headphones, and earbuds. The earbuds become painful after a short period of wearing them, some of them fall out easily. Many of the headphones feel like vises. Other behind-the-neck headphones move around too much or become dislodged from my ears when I move my head.I picked this up for just under $5. The volume is louder than most of the others I've bought. The ear pieces stay in place! I can move my head around and the ear pieces don't move. I was so pleased with them I purchased a second pair."
1,Awful,"Bought one pair, they broke after three weeks (static sound and dropping sound from one channel) exchanged for another pair, and they broke after one week (same sound issues). Worst. Headphones. Ever."
1,Cheap...because its useless,Purchased these to use while jogging to replace my broken Aiwa swoops. The sound quality is horrible. I can't stress it enough. It wouldn't even be worth it for 99 cents.
3,Not Bad For The Cheap Price,"These headphones are cheap, so one shouldn't expect much from them. If you want in-the-ear headphones that are connected with a behind-the-head neck band, this is a fine deal. The sound could be worse (although not much worse), and the headphones STAY IN PLACE, which is why I wanted behind the head neck band buds in the first place. If you're going to use them often, spend $20 on a pair that sounds better and is more comfortable, but for my rare use this was a good deal."
4,"comfortable, doesn't fall out","I use headphones hooked to my ipod shuffle while I am working. I have a yard care business, and I have trouble with normal ear buds/headphones falling off and not seating properly in my ear. When I found these, I was completely happy. No other headphone has come close to the comfort and ease of keeping attached. And when you need to hear, you just pop out the ends from your ear, and rest them around your neck. I won't use anything else."
4,"Cheap, GOOD FIT, won't fall off, EXCELLENT FOR EXERCISE, sound not the greatest","I use these for gaming late at night when I MUST use headphones. All other headphones I have tried hurt my ears, even my fancy Zennheisers. I've tried all kinds - over ear, on ear, ear loop, buds - they all hurt and fall off. These DON'T move. EXCEPTIONAL FOR EXERCISE. Can get sore ear canals from these (they sit almost inside the ear canal), but only after 2 hours. The one time in 6 months that you get your hand or arm stuck in the wire will probably break the wire and cause drop out. Wish they'd make a model with a better (tougher, more durable) cord. As it is, I just assume I'll break them every 6-10 months so I keep a few pairs in the house. AND they DON'T interfere with my BASEBALL CAP! Nor with my really long hair."
1,don't buy these,"I've bought several, they break after only a few weeks no matter how careful you are with them."
1,Horrible Heaphones,I bought these head phones on impulse.I had a long trip and left mine at home.I dont know what this company was thinking about when they made these headphones.I think no one considered comfort.The buds will kill your ears!!.I guess maybe you can put some kind of cushion on the ends of the phones to make them more comfortable but they should have put that with the product.Dont buy these headphones unless you want a earache
1,Worst ever,"1st pair broke after month, sent to replace, second pair broke after 3 weeks, sent again, 3rd pair lasted 6 weeks. Sound distortion, ""clipping"" in and out. No abuse whatsoever to them... with normal usage, they just don't last. Don't even consider buying them."
5,Back to his roots,"First off, let me tell you that ""Balin"" is different. Fred goes back to his folk/bluegrass roots sound on this one. If you're familiar with his first five or six releases (which are tough to get in the states these days), you'll know what I mean. I believe this is as good, if not better, than any of his rootsy discs. Fred sings about real issues and real people, and you'll get a kick out of some the topics he covers on this one. A great sense of humour and some heartbreaking tunes make this one of this year's best."
1,have to be careful,"if u are gonna buy the second season of el capo you gotta be sure that it's call el capo 2 2012 and not 2011 because the new season came on tv on 2012, from there its the mistake.."
3,Its ok,"The picture was not very good and all the disks just came stacked up on top of each other, it was very hard to get them out."
1,didn't receive the package,It says it arrived but it has not because I've been checking every day. I suppose that maybe you guys got confused with the addres because there is West Enid drive and East Enid drive.
4,how many people are going to remake this?,"With mansons dark image and sexual nature, I think he was destine to do this song, however, I think the band ""My Ruin"" does a better job on this song. I like mansons version too, but The girl from ""My Ruin"" tares it up!"
4,Interesting,"An example of beat poetry of the 1950s. Much of the material grips you but other parts make you feel like the poem is part of an inside joke you are never going to get. Good but not engaging... someone decided to ping me about this book a year after I read it and I could not recall a single poem I read in it (unlike poems I have read in the ""everyman"" series on Kipling, jazz, war, etc.). Not great poetry but good. It has nothing to do with Wasilla, Alaska."
5,"very good conditon - like new, very pleased.","This is a hard book to locate, and was so glad to have it offered here. I am very satisfied with the book, it is in excellent shape. thanks!!!!"
3,A book of poems,I was neither bored nor exalted by this book of poems. The collection was so-so to me.
2,"I'm usually a fan of Ursula Le Guin, but . . .",". . . this one, no. I started it with great expectations, remembering the earlier incarnation of this ""world"" of hers. But to me, this collection just didn't measure up to what I expected of this author. That's not to say I won't read her again: I've read ""The Left Hand of Darkness"" more than once, and surely will read it again -- something new appears every time. But I can't really recommend this offering. And I'm sorry about that."
4,The Birthday of the World by Ursula K. Le Guin,"Recently I found out of this novel collection from one of my favourite SF writers, and it didn't dissapointed me.It was nice to visit Hainish world one more time by reading those new novels, and some of them were really good (Solitude, Old Music and the Slave Women) and I recommend this novel collection to everyone who likes a thinking man's SF."
4,LeGuin Never Disappoints!,"As usual, LeGuin draws us into her wonderful imagination and takes us on adventures as if we were there. Some of the stories are better than others, but all of them are very good!"
2,Eos Sound System - Poor Sound Quality,"I purchased the Eos system with the idea of finally being able to use my computer to play my itunes music collection wirelessly elsewhere in the house. I had read many reviews but was not prepared for the sound quality from the speakers. While I am not an audiophile, the lack of real low end quality made the music sound tiny. I listened to multiple different types of music and none were acceptable. I sent it back shortly after. I am low looking in to a Sonos system though am not happy about the price tag."
4,Great general problem solver,"I just wanted to play music from my ipod throughout my house in different locations without any complicated setups. It does exactly that. I can turn on my ipod and have the same music playing as I do chores throughout the house, get ready for bed, or put music out on the deck. The unit is small and mostly unobtrusive. I got the extra speaker to have my music going on all three floors at once. Every so often I unplug a speaker from an outlet and put it into another room to change things up, and it doesn't need to be reset or anything. All the buttons are simple and you don't need a manual to figure out what turns what on. I have had this maybe a year? - and am still happy with it. There isn't much (anything?) out there that can do what this system does for the price. I sure don't feel the need for a stereo system on every floor now.New: Still liking it, and bought one more speaker to cover more of my house!"
3,"Works great with Sonos, replaced Airport Express, has hum","See my review re: the other receivers to understand how I combined this with Sonos to create an awesome system. For this particular unit, I was a little less than happy. I don't know if it's my particular unit, but I can hear a pretty noticeable hum. I called them up and they're willing to exchange or accept it as a return. I'm on the fence though, and I'll probably end up keeping it just because it's so handy.For all the other rooms in my house, I use the other receiver module with self powered speakers, but this little device is great for where you need to just have a speaker plugged into an AC outlet without dealing with all the hassles of multiple devices, power outlets etc. I wish it was more boombox like, maybe battery powered, definitely more weather resistant. I like to carry it out on the deck, use it in the garage, etc. The other units stay in place, but this is a perfect unit for carrying around."
4,The voices are the instruments!,"I know I am out of the ordinary, but I enjoyed the first CD far better than volume 2. The first recording exposed the exclusiveness of these talented children. The 2nd CD brought in the contemporary beat which is not necessary as only the slightest musical accompaniment is needed or the loftiness of these voices is erased.The original Von Trapp Family singers rested in their voices and viewed them as instruments in themselves.And my cat Alfredo, who had never responded to music before or since, came and sat right next to the speakers and still rushes into the living room when I play the original outstanding recording.Please Von Trapp children, make more CD's with the thought of your voices holding the instrumentation."
5,Great!,"The songs are really good! I especially like Down to the River to Pray (both with music and a ccapella), My Old Kentucky Home, and Once Upon a December. Until I got this CD, I've only heard that song on Anastasia (and I watched that movie years ago), so it was great to hear it on a CD! I can't wait until the von Trapp Children get more CD's out, or come to my town!"
1,The Interrogation of Michael Crowe (True Stories Collection),I was extremely disappointed in this film. It is boring and I never completed the entire movie. This is the first time I ever saw a true story that I wouldn't finish watching. If I had seen this film beforehand I never would have purchased it.
4,"THROUGH THE EYES OF THE DEAD, BLOODLUST","If you like: Suicide Silence, Between the Buried and Me, My Bitter End, Carnifex, or Bring me the Horizon's - Count your blessings cd, then you will probably like this cd. Two Inches from a main artery is the song that turned me on to these guys. I can't decide whether I like the original singer, the one on this cd, or the new singer, the one on the new cd, better. The original singer has more range than the new one, he's kind of monotone. I own this one and the new one and can't decide which I like better. This is a great cd and worth the money."
1,Aweful,"I get the idea, but it's awful. Slightest ""miss"" and your player will hit their hand on the bar, unrealistic ball placement, unnatural swing. Good idea, but the design needs work. We threw it away. Wasted money."
1,Review for the Tandem Sport Spike Trainer for Volleyball,"I bought this as a gift for my grandaughter. First of all there were no instructions or any kind of material with it. We did figure it out on our own. Also, a long metal pole with a semi-circle on the the end is not worth $78.00. There is nothing to it. She did keep it and hopefully she will be able to use it."
3,casio databank watch,"Keyboard tedious to work with, and entering data like phone numbers and schedule info is very cumbersone. Watch band pulls hair on wrist."
1,"Great watch, lousy band","I've had this watch in black, silver, and gold. This watch is better at keeping important info close at hand and way easier to keep that info safer since we all lose phones like they were a dime a dozen, but, how many times do you lose a watch? I keep everyones birthday scheduled a few days in advance so it warns me before I run out of cash. Important numbers like wife and kids SSN's, DLN's phone numbers, etc are seconds away. Now the bad news.... every data bank watch has had a band go south on me. If it's the metal it kinks and if it's the black plastic it tears. Doesn't matter because I am so use to it I buy a velcro band the same day. Looks dorky but it's the function that sells this product. I put a poor rating for 2 reasons. 1 The bands all break by the first week, 2nd..... I don't want the few left out there to be bought up before I can nab them. Ha!"
4,question?,"Do any women have this watch? I have a tiny wrist but loooove it so much and desperately want to buy it, but wonder if it will look absolutely silly on me..."
3,SHARP LOOKING WATCH,"I am a watch nut, and fell in love with the looks of this watch, but have a problem with the band! First the band is very stiff which makes it difficult to put on, and then when I finally get the clip engaged the lock clip on the band is hard to make a positive engagement, and it popped open a few times and I almost lost it! I gave thought to return the watch, but decided to keep it and wear it on special occasions! As for the watch, it keeps perfect time.."
2,Nifty but not good for a 70 year old,"I am returning this watch. The band is difficult to snap closed, The numerals are difficult to read and programming is quite difficult as one of the buttons doesn't respond quickly. The last issue may be with this particular watch but buyer beware, it may be an inherent problem for all of this type of watch.I've contacted the seller Amazon ""shopemco"" they have approved the return less shipping charges (only fair) because the watch isn't realy defective it's just the way it's manufactured and if I were 20 years younger I may be able to live with it."
2,Not the easiest way of getting good results.,"I received the ""kit"", two cheap cloths and a very small tube of cream. This is supposed to be a repeat process done on a hot iron and it is a slow process that leaves a lot behind. It may work but you would have to be very patient and still it may leave some burn traces behind.The simple alternative, get a small tube or bottle of FLITZ METAL POLISH and your iron's stainless steel sole will be clean in under 2 minutes. A German invention Flitz has been around for years and is inexpensive and available from your local hardware store or from old reliable Amazon.com."
5,Worked like a charm,"I don't know what everyone is complaining about. If you follow the directions, it works like a charm. It took like 2 minutes, if that. I think that most folks are not following directions on the use of the iron itself. We have softened water and a reverse osmosis system, which is what I use. Hard water will cause issues that cannot be removed by this cleaner. Squirt a little of teh cream on the supplied rag, rub the hot (empty!) iron over it, and voila, clean iron. Use the polishing cloth to buff it a bit, and burst a bit of steam on a rag to get out anything in the steam holes and it is as good as new. Buildup in the steam holes is a different issue...bad water! Buy a gallon of Crystal Geiser water for like $2 and use that for less gunk build up."
3,Not completely satisfied.,"Did not take off all of the residue. I spent 30 minutes trying to get the residue off, but still had some left. I have only had the iron for 6 months and I use filtered water."
4,As expected,"This product works exactly as described and makes cleaning the sole plate of our Rowenta iron quickly, effortlessly and completely leaving no residue."
2,It works....but,"We used this to clean a soleplate of a Rowenta iron we've owned about 4 months. The kit had a couple rags and a small tube of cleaner. It did work but required using the entire tube for one cleaning, so kind of expensive for only one cleaning. Now less than a month later the iron needs to be cleaned again. Would be nice if you could just get the cleaner by itself. Not sure if the problem is with our iron or maybe the water since we are living at a new address since we bought the iron. I will probably try and find a homemade remedy instead of paying another $12 to buy a cleaning kit. It does make me wonder why the company that made the iron also makes the cleaner, does that say something about the iron?"
5,USE THIS ALL THE TIME,"I've purchased several of these since I got my new Rowentairon a few years ago. It keeps it nice and clean and is easyto use.If I accidentally get a little bit of a burn on the plate, Itake this out and rub some cream on the cloth and theniron over it. It's all gone. The smell is rather nice also.My only complaint is I wish you'd get a bigger tube ofcleaner cream."
5,Love this product!,"The bottom of my iron was a mess from years of neglect. By following the instructions on insert I was able to completely resurrect my Rowenta Expert. I LOVE THIS IRON and this product with instructions on how to problem solve made my iron new again! I've been using this iron for at least 7 years now. If I could, I would buy everyone I know this iron. It is an absolute pleasure to use!!"
1,Destructive,"I read the reviews online before using this product. I followed the directions closely and put quite a bit of elbow grease into it. Instead of the cleaning the dirt, the non-stick surface of the iron began to rub off. This was an expensive Black and Decker iron. Now it's ruined, and it is still stained."
2,Didn't work as well as hoped,"My iron had a few burnt stains (probably from burnt material or a build up of starch). After repeating the process about 5 times on my iron, there was still buildup. If you are looking for something to clean that black gunk off your iron, I would not recommend this product."
4,As expected,Product as expected. This is to be used to clean the iron. The iron has not yet needed the product.
4,I wish they would sell this tube without the cloths too,"I was running low on my Rowenta cleaner and I bought this. I really don't need the cleaning clothes because I already have them, but I could not find the tube of cleaner without the cloths. This is a great cleaner and I use it a few times a year to get the gunk that occasionally drips out of my iron. It makes for a smoother ironing surface too."
5,Awesome Album,"I've purchased Geoff Moore CDs over the years and even went to one of his concerts when he came through town. He's always been a favorite of mine, but I hadn't recently bought any of his later albums (Home Run was one of my favorites). This album is awesome and I've listened to it repeatedly. I couldn't move on, it was that good!"
5,Magnificent Brahms,"I cannot imagine better performances of any of these pieces. The emotional impact of Oppitz's playing is overwhelming. He captures themood of each work perfectly. He plays with what can be best described as a flexible sound. At times it is pianoforte like, and at other times it rings out like a full orchestra. His use of the sustain pedal is very sparing; and when he does use it, it is with a subtlety that does not draw attention to itself. I will admit that this sound took awhile to get used to; but after listening to these discs a few times, it now seemsabsolutely right for this music. One can hear each note clearly. Thereis none of the muddiness that some performers bring to this music. Theseperformances would be worth having at any price; but at about $25.00 forsix discs and each disc having more than 70 minutes of music, this box setis a steal! I cannot recommend it highly enough."
2,Poor,Of all the various complete sets of Brahms I have heard this is by far the worst. Even the piano tone grates. The Brilliant set is cheap and good; the Katchen set is very good indeed.
4,lovemovies,"I liked this movie, it has Dean Cain which is a major plus. It has lots of action and the game was very interesting. The plot could have been a little better. Loved Wesley Snipes' character. He was great as the leader of the down zone. I would recommend it to any one who loved sports, conflicts and a good fight for what is right."
1,"Wow, this is so bad","If you want to see something REALLY GOOD, watch the original Rollerball. This is a wanna be of that"
4,A story with action is better than just action.,Fun to watch with the stars and Snipes. A sport that settles and replaces war is needed now. North America is playing this game to save many lives. Real thrilling movie.
1,Awful plot,"The plot was so ridiculous I couldn't even finish the movie. Effects were decent, but not enough to carry the film. Dean Cain is gorgeous with his scruffy unshaven look, and gives a couple of (too brief) topless scenes."
3,Are you paying attention?,"I am pretty much interested in technology and Dean Cain. When you combine the two, you get one great show. But whose paying attention to the plot when I was going ""WoW! what a high tech gadget."" and ""Oh, wow! He's is sure handsome."" All in all the show was okay, with two very nude female scenes, I just skipped over that part.But half the time I wasn't even watching, just in a daze looking at that gorgeous man and noticing how it relates to ""Lois and Clark. The new adventure of Superman."" Oh, the twist in the plot was nice too. Dean getting killed by his best jamacian friend from down under...or not."
3,"At least the pictures are good, but ...","This book is decent, but I question its accuracy. Its best section is on cutlasses and naval weapons. The pictures are good, but woefully mislabled. (E.g..- the lables for a page with five daggers is supposed to read clockwise from the top. In fact, the labels are completely mixed up.) Also, some categories lack even sketches of the weapons (e.g.-the Indian bhuj) and his verbal description makes no sense. Overall the book will fill out a weapons library, but I would recommend Anthony North's ""Swords and Hilt Weapons"" for starting out."
3,"A Collectors Guide to Swords, Daggers, and Cutlasses","This book should have been titled a historical analysis of Swords, Daggers, and Cutlasses. It gives a working basic knowledge of edged weapons. However there is no pricing information to be found in this book.It has many excellant pictures of edged weapons. However it gives a limited perspective of each catagory which leaves the reader salivating for more."
2,Better as a coffee-table book than a research source...,"If this is the first book on collecting swords that you get, make sure that you get a second and a third before you even -think- of going shopping. If this were the only guide that you were to bring with you into the world of sword collecting, there is a good chance you will embarrass yourself in front of even slightly knowledgeable dealers. Throughout the book, the proofreading is poor; that is, if it was proofread. Numerous captions are incorrect, and the authors research and conclusions are questionable at best. Conversely, this book does have some excellent photographs (many of which I have never seen elsewhere). Given the inexpensive price, it is worth purchasing for that reason alone."
3,A Pleasant Read,"The Witch & The Cathedreal, following the tradition of Brittain's Yurt series, is an enjoyable reading experience. It is light hearted and good for a chuckle. Beyond that, it intorduces a new chapter in the main character's love life. The tangled events leading up to his new love interest, and their connection together, porvide decent suspense and keep you turning the pages. If you're looking for deep and life-altering reading, than this is not the book for you. If you want something enjoyable to pass the time--you've found your book."
5,Excellent non-toxic product,The reduced scent non-toxic formula has allowed me to clean my firearms in a home where hyper sensitive family members do not have leave when I am applying products. Products seem to do their intended jobs just as advertized
2,More a seller gripe than product bash,"Has a lot more buttons on it than I was expecting (only expecting a reload button and trigger). So that was a happy surprise. But, although the item I bought was labeled as 'brand new', I can only shoot to about 70% of the tv screen. No matter what I do (short of taking it apart), I can't seem to fix that, which has diminished desire to play any of my guncon games."
3,"It's cute, but there's better out there","I bought this toy for my daughter when she was 17 months old. It is a very cute toy. The illustrations are nice, and the case is very appealing, with its smiling Elmo and Cookie Monster. My daughter is now 2, and she knows almost all of her alphabet - no thanks to this ABC desk. She has probably played with it 4 times in the last 8 months, it's just not a fun toy. The tiles are cute, she likes looking at them - the pictures on them are very engaging. The case, however, is a pain... It doesn't stay closed very well, so when she walks around with it, it opens and all the tiles fall out. Unless you have the tiles perfectly distributed the case will not close. The cards with 3-letter words are attractive, but they are made with thin cardboard and easily bend and tear. I am sure that some children will love this toy and spend hours playing with it, but it seems to me that there are better, more durable alphabet desks out there."
2,Could have been great but ISN'T,"My 22 month old daughter enjoys playing with the letters but gets very frustrated when it's time to put them away. The case will only close if you have the tiles in ""just right"" and it pops open easily, spilling the tiles. Also, the entire alphabet is not represented and the number sides are not in color. This could have been an excellent toy but it falls short in my opinion. The only reason my daughter plays with it at all is because she is fascinated with letters. As soon as I purchase letter shaped fridge magnets, I'm sure she won't even look at this toy."
5,"An Accurate Portrayal of The Mission of Thunder Field, Arizona","This is a non-violent, cute, sweet war-time movie about two pilots who both fall in love with the same local girl. Having done research on Thunderbird Field, in Glendale, Arizona, as it was back in 1942, this movie very accurately portrays the area, scenery & the mission of Thunderbird Field at that time in our American history as a pilot training base for World War II. It met all of our expections!"
5,GOOD MOVIE,THIS IS A USUAL LOVE STORY SO A GREAT MOVIE AND GENE WAS NEVER MORE BEAUTIFUL.GREAT COLOR
4,Thunderbirds - The Movie,This movie was great for me because I had gone to high school on the campus of the school where this movie was filmed. Many of the scenes are recognizable from my days there with the background mountains and a few of the buildings. Since I fly airplanes for a living it was great to see all the flight scenes also. Very nostalgic.
3,The PT-17 Stearman,"If you were a cadet in the Army Air Forces in WW II, you will enjoy this film. The story is flimsy but the shots of dozens of Stearmen lined up on the tarmak and the shots of them stunt flying will make up for the story line.This was the movie that in 1942 made me sign up as an Army Air Force cadet."
4,Tierney In Color!,"Thunderbirds is a short, entertaining movie about WWII pilots in training, with a love triangle thrown in. It's pretty light in content but getting to see all the old fighter planes in action and Gene Tierney (in color!!) is worth the price of admission and a 4 star rating!"
4,A standard work in late medieval English history,"As one of the wealthiest and most powerful landed families in 15th century England, the Staffords played an important political role (as students of Yorkist history have reason to know). Influence was tied directly to land and Rawcliffe examines the unique Stafford family archives in this study of estate and finance management and the patronage it enabled. The composition and work of the ducal council is also explained, since the council was made up of the duke's senior administrators and lawyers, upon whom the family relied heavily. The Staffords also used litigation rather than combat as their preferred means to an end. Moreover, they were instrumental in causing the crown to change its attitudes toward the nobility as a whole. A somewhat technical historical study in Cambridge's ""Studies in Medieval Life and Thought"" series, but definitely worth the investment of effort."
1,Go Wacom. Period.,"The tablet would be fantastic and great for its price, if it weren't for a single detail: right-clicks and middle-clicks often produce an additional false left-click. This gets annoying very fast and interferes with your work a lot. Get a Wacom instead -- it's only about 20 bucks more expensive, but you get a far better designed product that DOESN'T need batteries."
3,Travelguide from the 60s,"Like a travelguide from the 60s, this was a somewhat dated look at Americana. For me it lost its steam as Norwood wound his way from Texas to New York City to Louisana."
1,Norwood,A pathetic book with perhaps two slght chuckles. To use a Southern expression it would not make a patch for a good Southern humorous book like The Ballad of the FlimFlam Man.
3,It's a story,"The story itself is mildly entertaining, yet there really was nothing in it to relate to. Much of the events in the story take place, merely as a fact of life. I was worth the time to read it but, it's not a story you read for an adventure. Maybe to relax."
2,"Sorry, it's just dumb","You have to give Charles Portis credit for a well written book. He certainly has an ear for dialog and the nuanced speech patterns of the South, but in the end this is a book with no plot to speak of and little redeeming value. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,I would give it 3.5 / 5 stars,"I liked the last 50 pages or so, especially when the protagonist meets the ex-circus midget; but the rest of the book has too strong of a ""Forrest Gump"" vibe."
2,Skip Norwood and Go Straight to The Dog of the South,"If you're already a Portis fan, you'll find this familiar, if somewhat tedious, territory. It's really a practice run for the truly brilliant The Dog of the South. I wanted to like Norwood, but he's just not an interesting character, and implausibly slow on the uptake. If you've never read Portis, DO NOT read this first. If you are, you must meet Edmund B. Ratner, but be warned, this wonderful character doesn't make his appearance for some time. Norwood has some fine moments - notably his sojourn in New York City - but I was very disappointed."
3,Different from other fear street stories,"To me this is the very first fear street book which actually tells a story. The other books always are kinda about the same thing, murderers and killers and the clue on the end. To me these are also much better and scarier. Maybe I expected too much of this book. The story is about a brother and sister who's parents just dissapeared like that, then weird things start happening which all just does not make sense to them and they have to find out what really is going on. THere was nothing really scary in this story but more like an adventure story. Only the end was just a little bit weird, while reading this book you are eager to find out what happened to their parents. SO the ending comes as a dissapointment because it just seems a bit freaky and unreal. But hey if you are looking for a real story that will keep you guessing and guessing? read this one."
3,This is a strange book with a strange ending.,"You read through the entire book thinking something terrible has happend. They really mislead you the entire time. You get to the end and your like ""that's it? That's all? Your kidding me!"" Overall it was decent up till you get to the end."
3,"Kinda slow and confusing, but the ending, it's worth reading","I have to say, the whole book led me to suspect a lot of different endings and I was very pleased with the ending indeed! I have read all Fear Street Books with an exception of The Seniors. This doesn't make the excellent list but it makes the ""okay"" list. The ending helped to make my grade of 3 stars!"
3,Kinda confusing,"This was the first Fear Street book I've ever read, and it got me hooked on the series. It was ok, but I've read better. It's sorta confusing."
2,NOTHING!!!!!!!,"I had been reading R.L.Stine ' s books for quite a long time . What I am trying to say here is that I find that his (maybe or her) books (most of I'd read) aren't raelly interesting . It's just some kind of just fine , or just an OK , I think ! The ' Missing ' isn't a nice book to me . I got nothing from it . And somemore it'd somepart that incorret story progressing occured ."
1,Another horrible book...,"This book is very different from the other Fear Street novels I've read. The main story is Mark and Cara's parents disappearing and they try to find them. I didn't feel any suspense when I was reading the book. It was just plain...and boring. As I went deeper into the story, I grew more bored. The murder plot was so unrealistic."
5,Tecsun BCL/2000 and Grundig s350,"Don't believe the reviewer above. This radio is nearly identical, to the Tecsun BCL/2000. Tecsun has revised the design in the last few months. Tweaked it and removed all the bugs. It is now just as good if not better than the s350. You'll love either radio. My Tecsun is actually a little more sensitive than my Grundig s350....but it may be unit to unit variations. In any case you'll love which ever model you buy. They are both fantastic radios. And I am comparing it to say a Grundig YB400 fully modded, DX-394 fully modded, and DX-160 modded. For a broadcast Shortwave receiver its tops in its price class under either name."
2,OLD radio.,I bought this two years ago but stopped using it because of the following:1-Poor Frequency drift. It's an analog radio with digital readout so the tuner knob jogs a bit after being set. On FM I will be listening to 99.1 and the radio drifts to 99.3 requiring me to adjust it yet again. This happens on every use. It also occurs on AM and SW. This is the most annoying aspect of this radio.2- No frequency memories whatsoever. It's not a digital radio.3-The radio shuts off after 90 minutes requiring me to turn it on again.4- SW is spread across a couple of bands so you have to adjust the band to tune. When listening to SW or AM or FM you are always changing the position of the station on the corresponding other band. Too many knobs. THIS IS AN ANALOG RADIO WITH DIGITAL READOUT. GOOD ONLY FOR SOMEONE USED TO OLDER RADIOS.
4,"Good Radio, Great Reception, Great Tuning","A good radio. I picked up a used one on a recent trip in America. I'm able from several cities in the USA the past weeks receive BBC, VOA, and Dutch news casts. Also have received crystal-clear German, French, Spanish, and lots of oriental-language broadcasts (although I cannot understand them.) Also receives GMT time and sailor weather alerts with ease. Nice radio. I like the retro design and analog dials which help with fine tuning. A good buy."
3,Excellent AM/FM Radio SW leaves a little to be desired.,"I received the Grundig 350 two days ago. Since then I have listen to SW radio stations from all over the world, mostly in Europe. My main issue with the radio is drift. In order to listen to ANY shortwave station, I have had to adjust the frequency several times a minute. ShortWave is the worst. If I am not constantly tuning, I lose the station after 15 seconds. My experience is similar to others that I have read on the net. Unfortunately, I didn't see them until my order was already in-process. I couldn't cancel.If you want a great sounding AM/FM radio, buy this product. If you are looking for a SW radio, look else where."
2,Don't buy unless you can't find this at the store,"This order gets routed to Office Depot. I got charged $4.99 for a Small Order Processing Fee, WITHOUT WARNING OR NOTIFICATION, since this was the only item I ordered. It also didn't qualify for Amazaon's free shipping. Unless you can't find this item at a bricks-and-morter near you, don't buy this item through Amazaon unless you want to pay $8.00 over the quoted price - a rip off IMHO!!"
1,DO NOT BUY REFURBISHED INK CARTRIDGES!!!,"Remanufactured ink cartridges did not work in my printer, so it was a waste of money and time. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It is better to buy the original product from hewlett-packard, although the ink cartridges cost more, and recycle them then to buy defective, refurbished generics. I bought the product because people had given good reviews to the Amazon merchant and it was cheaper. Do not make the same mistake."
5,"Juanita Bynum, Her Music, Ministry & Message","If you want to get in tune with your enter self,in a quite place then this is the cd you must have, it will bring peace to your soul"
4,A great entry into Science Fiction!,"This was probably the first science fiction novel that I ever read, and I still have the original library hardcover edition that I acquired long ago. I have read this book multiple times, and it is simply a great science fiction novel. This is a clean family book as far as language and mature themes (although it does contain some battle scenes with gunfire and killings) which is good for young people to get started in science fiction. If I remember correctly, I first read this in fourth or fifth grade, and I enjoyed it immensely. Even though young people can read this book, it is still a very good story for adults, and I recommend it to everyone."
5,4GB Mini SDHC Card for Treo 750,"Transcend 4GB Mini SDHC Cardis a great memory card. Works great with my Treo 750 without any hassels. So far I have had no problems with the speed. And for the price, I believe this is an awesom buy!"
3,Wouldn't work for me,I have a silver motorolla Q phone. I tried this card on the phone and it would not recognize. I tried it on my 10 in 1 multi-card reader on my desktop computer (I bought in December of 06 so its only 3 months old) and it would not recognize. Either I have conflicting hardware or I received a faulty card. I returned it and got 2 Sandisk 2gb cards instead and they work flawlessly. Review is neutral.
1,still waiting,I wouldnt know cause the prodct never arrived and after denying that it hadnt arrived they want to charge me an extra 2 dollars to resend it
1,It dont work,"I received 2 of these and neither one of them works in anything! Not in my phone, camera, computer nothing. Junk! I still need to figure out how to return them and get my money back!"
1,?,I got this for a cheap price so i was like yay! but then i relized that nothing reads this card i went =( Everything that trys to access this card freezes or just doesn't read it!!!
1,bad customer service,"Customer service was horrible lost item and couldnt even refund me or at least give me a decent deal so I could by the item again,stay away from this company!"
1,Worked for almost 5 seconds then burnt out,"I bought one of these cards to upgrade the capacity of a well known portable media player which is SDHC compatible. It worked well for almost 5 seconds but, as soon as I started to put mp3s onto it, it just locked up. I popped the card back into a card reader on my PC and tried to reformat it but it was completely dead. I even took it to a specialist computer store to see if they could reformat it and they couldn't. The adapter was so poorly made that it fell apart as soon as I put the card in it too and I have no idea what happened to the plastic lock slider out of it because it just disappeared.Even though the equipment freeze-up was probably my own fault due to inexperience, it seems that I'm not the only one who has had problems with these memory cards. I've learnt a valuable lesson here but fortunately I didn't pay a lot for it."
4,Very helpful and value for money!,"After buying this book, I could not put it down. Simple structured and to the point with short chapters and understandable english. Very practical with a storyline (with white river raftering guide experiences- will enjoy) and questions - journal type, at the end of each chapter, made it easy to follow in a busy work schedule. The core messege quickly communicated and background given of authors, was easy for me to buy-in. The free online accessment, that come with it, was a bonus and my family, friend and staff confirmed the accuracy of the results - the profile of your strenghts and how you should continue with free downloadable guides. Although this book is published fo the ""church ministry"", it is just as applicable in the secular and business world. I will strongly recommend this practical book to new upcoming church planters and dynamic christian organisations and ""christians at work"" support groups."
4,Great insight into building teams,I found this book to be a great outline and helpful in identifying individual personality preferences and how best to use them.
2,Not the best book,"Although this book was ok, I thought it was kind of predictable. It doesn't have one of those endings that R.L. Stine usually have in his books."
5,Great Book,"This book was pretty good most of the time Fear Street books I can guess how the book is going to end and it gets boring, but this ending I didn't even guess and it was pretty surprising how it endding."
4,It was GREAT!!!,"I have read wrong number and wrong number 2. They are both wonderfully writen book. If you love a book with flare you will like this book, and if you like wrong number you will love wrong number 2."
2,i don't really like this book,"the story is not scary enough and quite boring,and i'm dissapointed bout this.i don't think i'm going to buy fear street book again"
4,A good book...,"This book is very exciting. Once you start reading the book you can't put it down till you finish the whole story...You should also read the Wrong Number 2, it's just as good..You will enjoy reading both the books."
3,A little dull....but still a ok book,First off i love all fear street and R.L Stine books im not saying this was a horrible book......but most of the story was a little dull.....They get a phone call from some random lady and they over hear her getting killed.That was the best part of the whole book.But most of it is these 2 girls having problems with realationships.......and making calls to stupid ppl...like i said b4 this is a not a terrible book but i wouldnt recommend it.
4,Worked as expected,"I purchased this as an add on to the AVF TV mount that I already had. The VRC mount worked as expected. Installation instructions could have been a little more clear. Most people should be able to figure out how to put the unit together, but the unclear instruction just adds additional time to the install."
1,Not worth it,"Looked nice in the picture, but had a manufacturing defect. The air chamber at the bottom of the slide wasn't sealed and didn't hold air. So, of course the slide didn't work. Also, the first time we emptied the pool, the plug ripped out. Contacted the manufacturer via e-mail for a replacement, but never got an answer. Very disappointed."
2,"Great idea, but doesn't perform","14 Gauge wire doesn't fit easily, recommend not using this product if using 14 Gauge or thicker wire.I used the product for about a month, then suddenly the right channels stopped working."
4,Simple solution to adding speaker zones,"This is a good, basic solution to adding speaker zones to your home. It's not much to look at, but does the job. My biggest complaint is the appearance; otherwise, a good buy."
5,"Good, inexpensive and does the job","This product works very well, It surprises me how inexpensive it is.I'm planing to order one more and install it in my RV.ThanksTom N"
2,Index was helpful...,"The book itself is only a listing of words that youmay encounter in the field, not really any definition orreference to other places that would help more. But the index is worth its part. Some good references to injuries that youmay see in the rehab field."
5,One great album!,"I've been a huge fan of Roxette for years, and I just recently purchased ""Pearls Of Passion."" I have to say, I was really impressed.This album is a must for any Roxette fan, but it's also a great album to have for any fan of the eighties. It features some great songs such as ""Secrets That She Keeps,"" the upbeat ""Pearls Of Passion,"" ""Neverending Love,"" ""Joy Of A Toy,"" my personal favorite, ""Like Lovers Do,"" and many other outstanding tracks.Roxette's subsequent albums do show an elevation in music-writing talent, but ""Pearls Of Passion"" is still one great album."
5,Pearls of Passion,A must have album if you are a Roxette fan. Start to finish it is a winner in my book.
5,The one that started it all for Per and Marie,Secrets that She keeps is such a great song that I can't get it out of my head. The songs may sound dated but it's great to see this album finally re-released. Look Sharp is a natural progression from this album. It's a shock to see Marie Fredricksen with long hair after all these years.
4,A wealth of Information,"I became aware of this treasure of a book because it was quoted in Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon. The information about the benefits of real, unrefined sea salt is amazing. Understandably, this book is rather detailed, and at times, tedious, but it has opened up the world of sea salt to me... for that, I am grateful."
5,So helpful,I has having a very difficult time getting thru my divorce. I was in a state of shock and denial. This book really helped. Thank you!
5,Helpful book,If you are in this devastaing situation then this is the book for you. Daily inspirational thoughts help get you through traumatic time.
3,Review is of the JVC Remastering,"If you are a jazz lover who finds the music of The Modern Jazz Quartet stimulating, then this XRCD remastering may be of great interest to you, despite its price of around thirty bucks. Sound quality is rather anemic on the bottom end and a bit restrained overall, but I doubt that this release has ever sounded any better. Strictly as a matter of personal taste, I must say that I have never found the music of the MJQ to be very satisfying, and the music on Django does nothing to make me want to alter that opinion. This is a CD for well-heeled MJQ fans only."
5,"Quality book, at an advanced level","This book goes into the mechanics of cognitive dissonance, and offers multiple studies varying aspects of the issue. A very good read for any researcher looking to understand the psychology of motivation. Well written and logical."
4,Same as Etymotic Research ER-6,"This is a pair of Etymotic Research ER-6 in a different brand and packaging. I got mine from eBay, much cheaper than what one would normally pay for ER-6, but after a few months of usage, I had some noise problem. I called in Etymotic, and they gave me an RMA, got it serviced quickly.The design of the case differs somewhat, but as long as you get the same super-quality earphones and good services that one would expect from ER-6, I know you'd be pleased."
4,"Decent history, okay kindle title.","First off, I must protest the shoddy formatting this title received on the Kindle. Gibberish characters instead of quotation marks, etc. Also, the one or two lines of editorial comment from the present day add nothing to the narrative, and in fact throw off the historical progression of the story of Jeff Raskin. Aside from that, the text does a fairly decent job telling the story of Jobs and Apple's meteoric rise. Much of this material was reused in Young's later monograph ""iCon: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business."" Factually, there is some material that is apocryphal, but on the whole Young seems to have sourced his facts where he could. To be fair, this is one of the earlier works on Jobs and the history of Apple, so Young didn't have the benefit of hindsight as much as other authors have."
4,Rewards for the NeXT big thing,"While ""Steve Jobs and the NeXT big thing"", may be a more current glaring portrayal of Steve's wunderlust to become a legend in his own time - the preachey-ness takes a lot of credibility away from what would otherwise be astute observations on Jobs' character. The Journey is the Reward - gets it right the first time, and puts an equal emphasis on both how Steve drives people nuts, and how people who have been driven nuts can do great things. It's either a pitty or a blessing that the author is no longer alive to see what has happened to Apple since the book was published."
2,Can you say revisionist?,"I'd say that for steve the money was the reward.And the effort, well, that was lying, cheating and stealing from his (few and fewer) friends."
5,The Vernon Johns Story,"I did not know about Mr. Johns until I saw this move - great, inspirational story! Everytime you think of the civil rights movement, you automatically think of Martin Luther King, Jr & Vernon Johns was his predecessor - Great movie!"
1,The Vernon Johns Story,"This is an excellent movie and we wanted to own our own copy. We hoped to watch it again during Black History Month. Two copies ordered and sent did not work.It was a very disappointing experience. Had to return both as bad discs!Guess we will try to DVR it next time the networks show it, Amazon is the only place I've found that offered it."
5,"a ""must have"" for anyone teaching the civil rights movement","Through the writing of Taylor Branch, I was first introduced to the brilliant Vernon Johns and his unacknowledged role in the civil rights movement. I subsequently read ""Voices for the Dexter Pulpit"" (ed. Michael Thurman) and the unpublished biography of Johns written by Henry W. Powell of The Vernon Johns Society. The brilliant performance by James Earl Jones is as close to written accounts as one would expect. This is a ""must see"" for anyone who teaches the civil rights movement. Provides for a great debate topic - Johns v. MLK - why did one succeed and the other not?"
4,I like this movie.,"WARNING; THIS MOVIE MAY CAUSE A CHANGE OF HEART IN ITS VIEWERS. This is a great movie about a modern day prophet who is rejected byy his own people, but continues to spread the word. I give it a 4 1/2!"
4,The Vernon Johns Story,"This is an incredible story of a real man with a determination to live his life in truth and faith. His wasn't afraid to 'rock the boat' in the segregated south of his time, whether it be sitting on a bus or from the pulpit of his church.Much of this story is seen through the eyes of his daughter as she comes to appreciate her often absent, often embarrassing and always stubborn father. He teaches truth to his congregation, to his community and to his daughter.This wonderful made-for-TV movie has a great cast, head up by the incomparable James Earl Jones, in the role of this heroic preacher."
5,Language of the Enemy,"I found the movie very powerful yet creative. Most have compared this movie to a mordern day romeo and juliet but I disagree. This movie has a twist unlike any other movie that I have seen. I did not see two of the major events happening in the movie. I enjoyed the movie. However, I enjoy any movie that highlights a bit of foreign realities."
4,An unexpected gem of a movie!,"I had low expectations for this movie - the description and cover blurb made me think it would be another in the genre of ""bad Arabs, wonderful Israelis"" propaganda but I was very pleasantly surprised at the way from the very start, it approached all its characters and all sides in this conflict with great compassion and insight and reflecting a depth of knowledge. The characters are all very engaging and the story is both enlightening and entertaining with unexpected twists. The locations are authentic and really draw you in. I'd strongly recommend this movie!"
1,Garbage,"This is such a terrible movies. I can't believe I wasted my time watching it and that other people have given it positive reviews. The story-line is romantic comedy, not action or drama, and the acting is incredibly poor."
3,it broke!,The pillow was excellent until it broke. It no longer vibrates and i sjust an ordianary pillow.
2,ultrasonic bark control,I had no luck with this product!Did nothing at all to stop the barking.I tried different places near the front door and did nothing!!
2,"For my dog, it didn't work","I was excited to try this product, however my little guy paid no attention to it. I have a terrier mix who loves to bark at any unfamiliar sound and the washing machine. He would bark, the light would indicate it was working and he would continue to bark. I even tried to point it directly at him and bring it close to him while barking. He paid no attention. This product was tried indoors and outdoors with the same result. I gave it to a friend with a Miniature Schnauzer. Unfortunately she experienced no reduction in barking either, however her dog did look at it from time to time, hence the two stars, not one."
5,Heaven Sent (miniature dachshund/chihuahua mix),"We moved from a house to an apartment and were dreading buying bark collars for our two 6 year old chiweenies. I hadn't heard good reviews about these sonic products, but decided to give it a try before strapping zappers on my pups. It works like a charm!!! My dogs barked at EVERYTHING. Car doors closing, people talking outside, keys jingling, visitors, mail delivery... you name it. I don't even want to think about how many times they woke the baby. Within an hour of having this device in the apartment, they were trained. It's been 2 weeks now and my husband and I are still amazed. We even tried taking them to a (very populated) dog park for the first time ever, and they were little angels. Seriously, this thing is worth its weight in gold to our family."
1,Useless item,"This product does not work at all. It's like a plastic toy you'd find at the bottom of a Crackerjack box. I would suggest doing research on other sonic-control devices (which will certainly cost more), and also to keep in mind that, overall, sonic control devices don't have a great track record when it comes to long-term effectiveness."
2,petsafe ultrasonic indoor bark control,"my shitzu puppies payed attention to the device for a couple of days, but continued barking anyhow. they just seem to ignore it now totally. its a waste of money."
1,Wanted It To Work But...............,"To update my review, my dogs eventually grew accustomed to it and it has NO effect whatsoever on the barking. Oh, i take that back, they do quiet down when i threaten them, ""I am going to get out the bark machine!"" Little do they know it is sitting right there going crazy. Doesn't bother them!"
2,meh...,"Initially, this item seemed to startle my 10 month old poodle mix and distract her from barking. But I think she either got used to the sound or the sound made her more agitated, because after a week or two the barking almost seemed to get worse. We finally took the battery out and put it away. And it may be just coincidence, but the barking seems to have subsided somewhat. (We've since been putting the leash on her and making her sit and ""be quiet"" and then rewarding with a treat when she complies, after every time she starts up a round of barks at people outside the apt. So far, she's not gotten worse.)"
1,music to my dog's ears,"It simply didnt work on my dog, I was really hoping because that was my last resort but NADA, he continued to bark :("
1,My dogs don't care about it,"I would not recommend this item. I bought it one year ago. I was at the time hopeless regarding my two dogs barking. At this time they are even worse and I am considering shocking collars because they are driving me, my family and neighbors crazy. I just used this device for one month. Every time my dogs barked the light would turn on and the dogs would stop barking to look at the device. But at this time I think it was just curiosity, or maybe they got used to the noise (that I could not hear of course). They stopped caring about it within one week. They are two medium sized dogs, mixed breeds."
2,Disappointed,"This worked well and had the desired affect in the beginning, but it didn't last too long...maybe a month. Would not recommend it."
3,Cut some of the barking,I purchase one for the outside and inside.I have noticed a reduction in the outside parking but the battery runs out quickly. Only last about 2 weeks.
1,"Works at first, Dogs got used to it.","We have a Lab, Boxer and Yorkie. At first the collar stunned everyone, and it was really quiet for a few days. The Yorkie would shake when she heard the noise, I guess she just didn't know what was going on. After a few days, the Lab started barking again and my other two dogs would cower away like they had done something wrong. A few more days later, all three dogs were barking again. Guess they got used to the sound."
4,Whirl,"I have three dogs, this works on one of them, doesn't seem to do a thing for the other two. One thing to check is push the test button on the unit. You'll get a red light but you should also barely hear a whirling sound as the unit spins up. I've had these where the light came on and no mechanism activating inside after a few weeks of use- that's a sign to return it for a new one. It advertised as inaudible to humans so you'll only hear it when within a few inches."
1,Worthless Gadget!,"We have a Boston Terrier who barks constantly when playing ball----so we bought two of these units; one each for upstairs and downstairs. She's really too small for a bark collar so we tried these.Since the signal is ultrasonic, the only way you know when the unit is working is a red light flashes when activated. While our dog barks loud enough you can hear her in the house while sitting outside with the front door closed, the PetSafe won't work even as close as 4 foot away.Simply put, it's not sensitive enough and there is no way of adjusting the sensitivity.We've been round and round with the manufacturer, who has offered no solutions.Highly recommend against anyone buying one of these units. They're a waste of money."
1,Disappointing,"We've tried several bark deterrent methods with our Sheltie. The vibrating bark collar works best, though with her thick coat it is hard to keep a patch of skin shaved for the close contact over her voicebox it requires, and it is a higher maintenance approach, needing to take the collar on and off (for walks, etc.). So, we have been looking for a more user-friendly, humane, consistent deterrent and hoped this product was it, despite mixed reviews. Unfortnately it was not. We tried it for two weeks before it was evident it was not going to make our dog stop barking. We could tell she detected the sound emitted from the device and even tried to manually ""practice"" with her associating the sound with her barking, but it never phased her at all, much less make her stop the barking. We returned the device and will continue the search."
2,Does not seem to work for our dog,The unit has lights to let you know when it is on (blink green) and when it is sending the ultrasonics (red). But since humans can't hear I can't verify if it is working. It senses when the dog is barking and shows the red light blinking. But it does not seem to slow down the barking. So it could be the dog is just immune to the correction and loves to bark. The unit is moderately low priced and was worth the experiment to see if this would work.
2,Doesn't work on our dogs~,This device does NOT work for our dogs. They stand right in front of it and bark and bark and bark. The red lite comes on but must not be putting any ultrasonic sound out as has no effect. I am totally dissatisfied with it and am going to try to return it.
5,WORKED FOR US!!!,"All we know is my Dad bought this for his two YAPPY and I mean YAPPY yorkshire terriers. We were there when he set it up and I rang the doorbell and YAPYAPYAP.....uh. They looked at each other like ""WTF"" and that was that. Sorry all the other folks had no luck. Hate it for ya. BTW, my Dad paid $50 + ship for it elsewhere!!"
1,Stupid! Terrible!! Rediculous!!!,I am ashamed to have bought this useless item. It never worked at all - whether my dog was barking 10' from it; 5' from it or was right on top of it.Don't waste your money
1,USELESS,Very simple...it doesn't work. I have three Beagles who bark frequently and they just ignore the sound given off. I know the gadget gives off the sound as I can pick it up with my hearing aid so: gadget sounds off...dogs ignore.
5,Extremely Satisfied!,"We purchased the Ultrasonic Indoor Bark Control and we were very happy with the results. Our Coton de Tulear, part of the Bichon family of dogs, responded very well to this device for 2 or 3 months. But gradually she got used to the sound and it no longer stopped her barking. I removed it for about 6 months hoping it might work if I used it intermittently but that was not to be the case. I'm seriously disappointed that the blessed peace it provided at first didn't last. I spoke with the gal who told me about how well this device worked for her and unfortunately I learned that she had the same experience that I had; her dog is also part of the Bichon family of dogs. We are both very disappointed."
5,This did the trick! Great for apartment/condo setting especially.,"I was VERY happy with the results of this product on our 2.5 year old weimeraner. He has a deep, husky (and very loud!) bark whenever he hears someone outside or coming up the stairs. We live in a condo, so this had to stop. We gave this product a shot and it worked like a miracle :) He would bark and mid-way stop abruptly when the noise kicked on (i didn't hear a thing). Now he just woofs occasionally quietly (which is perfectly fine). This also works on my chihuahua when she tries to chime in on the barking."
2,Not the greatest . . .,"I purchased this to try to prevent my dog from barking when I have to kennel him. I didn't want to use a shock collar, so this seemed like the best solution, but I'm not so sure that it was. First of all, it drains the batteries really fast. If you are going to use this item, I'd suggest pulling the battery completely out until you actually need to use it.As far as preventing my dog from barking, it certainly did help. It didn't stop him completely, instead he just lets out high pitched yips, but that's an improvement from what he used to do.Summary: The product does help to prevent loud barking, but the battery drains way too fast (in a matter of a couple of weeks). I think there are other products out there that are better. Maybe if the price were lower, this would be worth it. (Like around $10). I wouldn't buy this again."
1,terrible,I bought this thing and it worked for a few days and then nothing I wished I could return it and get my money back
1,WASTE OF MONEY.,"This product was a total waste of money. I have a small dog and I thought this would be perfect for him. I got it and set it up by the front door, which is where my dog barks the most. My family came over and once they opened the door, my dog started barking and the red light came on and it did not even faze my dog. He just kept on barking and barking, so I tried manually pressing the button and he heard it then but he only just turned his head to the side and then returned to barking. If I could turn it up louder then maybe it would work, but as of right now it doesn't work. So not worth the money paid for it. I would highly NOT reccomend this to anyone, if it won't work with my small dog then I'm sure it won't work with big dogs either."
4,"Effective, Mostly",I got this to curb my dog's night time barking. It really worked. He is calmer too. But he also has figured out how to bark once wait 3 sec. and bark again--this doesn't trigger the device. But all in all he is barking less so I love it and won't be searching for a stronger product.
1,Ultrasonic Bark Controller,This product does not work. My dog never stopped barking. She perks her ears like she hears something but doesn't stop barking. I would not waste your money!!!!
1,Doesn't work,"This product seemed to work when I pushed the button. However, I needed it to work when I wasn't home. Obviously when I wasn't at home I couldn't hit the button. My dogs would bark and it would not even phase them."
1,Big waste of money!,"I purchased this unit as I have 2 Chihuahuas who would bark anytime I left my apartment. The first day I received this it worked great, the noise or sound stopped them quick from barking. By around the 3rd day it no longer seemed to work at all. The light kept flashing so I changed the battery....still nothing. I would leave my apt. and hear my dogs ""singing and howling"" for at least 5 min. This thing is a big waste of money and does not work in the long run. The dogs get used to the sound and no longer care if it makes noise or not."
1,does not work as advertised,Did not work unless dog was 12 inches away or you had to push the button yourself. Did not bother the dog at all. Returned to amazon.
1,Useless,"Desperate times forced me to buy this product. Next time I will just give the dog $40 and see if that works. Can't be worse than this product.The Petsafe PBC-1000 Stationary Ultrasonic Bark Controller does not pick up the sound of my dog's bark to automatically emit an ""ultrasonic"" blast. When I press the manual control it does emit a sound that is very audible to my ears but only piques a slight interest from my dog as she merrily barks away.Bottom line: save your money, do not buy this product."
1,Just Buy a Citronella Collar,"WE were hopeful that this product would work on our 7-month old doxi- terrier mix. He is about 12 pounds and is a rescue dog with some separation anxiety. He barked at night, every night. We had done our part, training him with various ""non-tool"" methods. This was our first tool and it let us down. He just looked at it. I think he even barked MORE. We bought a citronella collar, let him wear it in off mode for 4 days, then turned it on - and prayed. IT WORKED! Thank God. We are sleeping at night It literally works every single time. So, don't buy this or any other ultrasonic device. Just get a citronella collar!! Feel free to contact me with questions."
2,Didn't work on my Pug.,"Unfortuneatley this product didn't work on my Pug. At first she got a puzzled look on her face and walked away. After a few attempts she just ignored it and kept on barking. This device also reacts to other noises like the stereo, blender, hairdryer, coughing, sneezing, etc. Maybe it will work for you, but it did not work for me."
1,My Dog still barking,"My dog's bark would not set off the alarm and when I manually set it off, she didn't seem to be bothered. Not worth it. If you have a dog with a deep loud bark, this would work but it did not work on my small yippy dog."
1,Bark Controller,This product was supposed to keep my dog from barking. I have a Bichon Frise who is 4 years old. It doesn't work for her as she barks at the product when it emits a sound which is supposed to beannoying to her.
1,Did not work for me.,"I had the same reaction as another reviewer. The first time I manually activated the unit, my dog cocked her head sideways and hushed. Now she completely ignores it after a week. Never has it worked on its own. But that's no wonder since the unit has to be within 10 feet of the barking dog (?????) which is impossible unless you follow the dog around while holding it. So the few times I did walk up behind her with it, I'm convinced the only reason she stopped barking for a moment was to wonder why I was following her around with this thing.The one star is because she CAN hear it; however, it's apparently not annoying enough to make her stop being annoying."
1,"Useless... But if you're fired up to buy one, I'll take $20 for mine...","Yeah, Absolute crap, If you are looking for an appliance to slowly drain your 9v batteries, buy this and a smoke detector, no wait, just buy a smoke detector, that way if your house catches on fire hopefully it will work and you'll get out ok. If this item worked then your dog might not alert you to a fire and you could die from smoke inhalation, so man I should have talked myself out of this before I bought it and just went with the 8 smoke detectors, now I am stuck with a barking dog, a useless 9v draining device and aparently a unsafe home. Good luck..."
3,helps but doesn't stop hyper barking,"Definitely helped shorten the frenzy, but she seems used to it now so that doesn't seem to deter the barking in the first place."
1,No Good,I bought this because I moved into a mobil home and was very close to the neighbors and my dogs were barking bothering the neighbors when I would leave the house. They just acted like they did not hear a thing so I am not sure they did.
4,Works well for me,"I have a Jack Russel mix and a Chihuahua mix. I bought this item knowing there are so many mixed reviews. I guess it works for some dogs and not others. This item works well for both of your dogs. My dogs usually go nuts if someone leaves the house. They bark non stop. After trying this item, they bark once or twice and they learn quick. I have had it for a week and they practically do not bark at all when someone leaves now so it works as well as I had hoped. My only gripe is there is no on/off switch on the device. I have to take out the battery to turn it off. Not a big deal but I would give it 5 stars if it had the switch. It also works well as a training device. I'm pretty happy with this."
1,Did not work at all for my dog -- returned.,I have an elderly chihuahua who barks at everyone. This product did not work at all for him so I returned it.
2,regular performance,I am not really sure what to think about this item. It did work once i took it out of the box. The dog was quieter for the first month. After that she went back to her barking habit. Heavy consumptio on batteries
1,Petsafe indoor bark control PBC-1000,Petsafe indoor bark control does not work! Dog reacted at first but keeps on barking. would not recommend. if I could I would send back
1,i was naive,"I read the reviews before I purchased this item and hoped for the best because when my GSP gets bored when I'm at work he barks and I come home to hate mail taped on my apartment door. So with great optimism I plugged the battery into the simple unit and waited until something made him bark. Initially he cocked his head to indicate he heard a noise but he went right on barking. Two weeks later the battery needed to be changed and he acts as if he doesn't even hear any ""ultrasonic"" beep. I wish I hadn't spent the money. I wish I hadn't such high hopes. I wish I hadn't thrown away the box the unit arrived in, otherwise I'd return it and ask for my money back."
2,Don't waste your time or money,"After purchasing this item to help train our barking puppy, I actually went as far as holding it right in front of her as she barked... and it would never go off. On the other hand, it goes off regularly from normal human conversation. The sad part (and actually the only reason I didn't give it one star) is that the sound does seem to have training potential when I used the manual button. The problem is just the bark detector, which is apparently not worth anything. I'm returning this and will try a more expensive and hopefully better device."
2,Not for a clever dog,I have two female Weims that start barking at everything that passes by our house around 5:30pm. They are waiting for my husband to come home from work. The first night that I used this product it worked. The second night they barked all they wanted and louder than I had ever heard them bark. The third night they had removed it from the wall where I had mounted it and chewed it up.
5,Impressed,"I am surprised by how well this actually works! I have a Corgi (hard headed Corgi) who loves to bark at any and everything. Within 1 day he learned that the sound only happened when he barks! We've had the devise for about a week now and his barking has significantly reduced. He still occationally lets a bark slip out but nothing like it used to be. The nice thing about this product is that he can still make noise and communicate but it has taught him not to use his loud, ear piercing Bark in the house. I would definitely recommend this product!"
3,Needs an off switch or sensitivity adjustment,"Whether or not this thing stops your dog from barking is totally dependent on how your dog reacts to loud noises. My dogs totally stop what they're doing when this thing goes off. It works great and the dogs have been barking much less since using this device.My reason for the 3 star review is because this thing can't seem to tell the difference between a person talking and a dog barking. It goes off when I'm speaking in a normal voice near it. I'll be talking and all the sudden notice the dogs run away and I see the red light on the device. This wouldn't be too bad if there was a way to turn it off or control the sensitivity, but I basically find myself having to remove the battery almost daily. It's rather annoying that there is not at least an off-switch."
2,"I gave it a try, but no dice","Tried this with two very noisy Swedish Valhunds. They notice the noise but completely ignore it, so it didn't stop the barking, not even a little. Oh well."
2,Not too effective,"I have a pitbull and a german shepard mix. The pitbull would bark randomly and would sometimes just go along with the shepard. The shepard on the other hand would bark at anyone near our house, when a car pulled up, when we left the house, and when we entered the house. So I bought this product and was immediately pleased. They would bark and then look all confused and the barking was cut down big time. However, after a couple days, it did not seem to phase my pitbull at all. He started back on his normal schedule. At this point I felt bad because the shepard still didn't bark, but she still had to listen to the noise because my pitbull was barking. I think she just had enough after a couple weeks and she started barking again too. So this product worked for a little while, but in the end it just wasn't for me."
1,Petsafe Bark Controller,"This device had absolutely no effect on my dachshunds. Thinking that perhaps the battery was the problem, I tried 2 additional new batteries with the same result. Perhaps this device was defective?"
2,Disapopinted,This device claims that it will send out a signal when a dog is up to 10 feet away. I have not seen it react except when the dog barks directly in front of it and three feet away.
2,Beware Cat Owners,The product appeared to be having an effect on our dog and may have worked in time but we had to discontinue use. It also bothered the cats!!! WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE CATS! This should have been mentioned prior to purchase. :(
1,They stare at it....and..... bark at it,"This was a complete waste of money.Type of dogs: 1 Maltese and 1 Havernese.At first they looked at the device and cocked their heads. When puppies it worked for a minute. Soon I found that they started barking ""AT"" these devices. They would first bark as passers by then when it went off they would run up to it (right in their faces) and bark at the machine. I thought themachine was defective so I went to the place I purchased and exchanged.... yet again.... same experience.Save your money!.... that or hire a bark trainer for a couple of lessons!"
2,Short-lasting effectiveness,"Either our little dog quickly developed a high tolerance for the Petsafe Bark Controller or the device quickly lost its ""juice"". Battery check shows no problem. Our dog ""recognized"" the unit and for about 4 days either stayed away from it or limited his barking when near it. Soon afterwards, though, he had completely ignored the controller and can bark within inches of it with no effect. Problem with products like these is that there is no way to check whether the unit is still emitting the level of ultrasound necessary to control barking. Conclusion: very short-term deterrent, and overall waste of money."
4,Petsafe Ultrasonis Bark,"The item is very well made and easy to use but I guess it's just my little doxie that isn't smart enough to know if she stops barking the noise will stop. Maybe I haven't used it long enough, I'll keep trying."
2,"Do not waste your money, buy a dog toy instead!","This device does not work. It did give us some quiet for a couple of days but the dog became accustomed to the high pitched sound and actually started barking worse. Fortunately the dog that was the problem was a foster dog who has gone to her forever home, where she gets tons of attention. Exercise and training is the best thing to stop a dogs barking. Lesson learned here. A bored dog with no or little exercise will bark!"
1,disappointing,Very disappointing and total waste of money. I bought the indoor and outdoor bark deterrants and initially they seemed to get my 3 dogs attention but after 1 week or less they were all back to the usual barking. Maybe for other breeds it works but not my Jack Russels or my Boxer/Whippet mix
3,Good product,"My dog still barks with this product in the room, but not as long as she did before and not as often. It doesn't help deter ""howling"" though, only barking."
2,SEEMS TO WORK,"THERE'S A LOT LESS BARKING IN THE AREA OF THE INDOOR BARK CONTROL. HOWEVER, WHEN I PRESS THE RED BUTTON, TO SET IT OFF, THE DOG DOES NOTHING. SO I'M NOT SURE IT'S WORKING. THE GUY AT PET STORE SAYS HE DOESN'T THINK ANY OF THEM WORK.."
2,"Worked okay at first, but then stopped making any difference.","I was so excited to get this product and end my dog's barking. It worked a bit for the first few days or so, I think mostly because my dog was startled by it. But, as time went on, he got used to it and now it doesn't make any difference at all."
1,PetSafe PBC-1000 (Chinese) bark control device Totally unsatisfactory,"This device is poorly made and totally unsatisfactory in every respect.The instructions direct you to ""turn the device off"" when not at home.But THERE IS NO ON/OFF switch.The battery must be disconnected. (A must since the device EATS batteries.) A Royal Pain,as the connectors are cheap and will become damaged unless extreme caution is exercised. Another shoddy Chinese product.But the real problem is that the device doesn't work! Unless you hold the device a foot from your pet's ear when he barks, the animal just glances at it and keeps on barking. At least that is the case with my Yorkie and Poodle. A total waste of time. The cardboard box it came in was more effective, when used as a paddle on their rears. Waste of money and time. I'm looking for a Made in USA product that actually does what it promises, and informs me of its shortcomings up-front. (No switch)."
1,Doesn't have the capacity that promessed,"Watch out! the ultrasonic noyses doesn't get 15 feets like is marked, it just work is you are walking and a dog bark near to you, don't waist your money."
2,not so useful,we have been with the product 1 month and the dog at the beginning he stop barking but now he got use to it and he still barking and ignore it
1,"Well, I had to try it!","I work out of my home and need a quiet home office environment. In order to maintain this, I would have to put my dogs outside or in another room on the other side of the house. They are not what I consider ""yappy"" dogs, but rather than take a chance on one of them hearing something unusual and barking while I was on the phone with a customer, I figured this was my best bet. Then I saw this little contraption online, read the many reviews, and decided it was worth a try. WRONG!!! It not only doesn't stop my dogs from barking, it acually agitates my spaniel to continue barking, instead of ""Woof, woof, I'm over it"" like she would normally do. I'm not sure if there is a satisfaction guarantee, but you can bet I'm going to check to see if I can send it back. If only it had worked like they said it would!!!"
1,Got migraines?,"You CAN hear this thing! Well, maybe that's because I'm under 25, but yes - you can hear it.Did it work on my dogs? For a day. Then they started ignoring it.Day 1 I was hit with a migraine - I get migraines every once in a while, take RX medication for it, etc. At first I thought it was a coincidence, took my medicine, was fine. Then the 2nd day...another migraine. Then the 3rd. And the 4th.Don't even waste your money on this piece of crap. I have 2 ""hard to train"" dogs, but come on - this thing is a joke."
3,It worked for my small dog,It is works for my 5 lb. dog but is most effective when I press the button. My 65 lb. dog isn't even aware of it.
1,not that great,This item definitely scares the wits out of our dog but does not deter her from barking. I would not recommend it.
2,Keep on Barking,"I have a handheld version of this which works well, but it also means one has to have it in hand to use it. Since I rarely had it near when the dog started to bark, I bought this one thinking it would be great since it will be on all the time. I have placed it in many different locations and although it appears to come on when the dog barks, it has absolutely no impact. I think key to these devices is the accompanying verbal command. If I use this device as a handheld and give a verbal command at the same time, it is much more effective. So bottom, line, don't waste your money on this one. Try the cheaper handheld versions along with a verbal command and it is reasonably effective. More and more, the verbal command alone is working for me."
2,It worked the first hour,"My dog would stop barking to listen to it and then after an hour or so, he stopped being curious about it."
2,Not worth it,"Worker great the first time, then never again. If you have more than one dog barking they easily get distracted by one another and just bark over the device. Only noticeable to the dog if things are quiet and nobody is talking, and no other dogs are barking. Otherwise, waste of money"
1,Device good ONLY for discharging batteries,"this device is absolutely USELESS!! has absolutely NO affect on our dogs barking activities indoors. to be more accurate, the device actually appears to STIMULATE the dogs to bark even MORE when the system activates! they VERY evidently ARE affected as they direct their attentions directly AT the machine when it activates so it's not that they don't notice the sounds, they are quite evidently angered by the noise and not at ALL intimidated or silenced. do NOT waste your money on bogus sales pitch claims made by these hucksters!"
3,Not what I had been told,"We have 4 little barkers. The worst one stops barking after about 2 minutes, but does not hesitate to start back up when instigated a few minutes later"
3,Barking device okay...,"At first it worked well with my dogs and decreased the excessive barking; however, it doesn't seem to be impacting them like it initially did. I was somewhat disappointed and I am using other devices to train my dogs."
2,Only slows the barking,"The Bark Control does make my dog barking when it goes off, but he starts again. And if he gets really riled up, he doesn't pay it any attention."
1,Zaps when someone coughs,"Have a yappy Jack Russell Terrier and reaction to her bark was bewildered stop. I thought Hooray, until my daughter coughed and set it off again, Sent it back.Doesn't differentiate between sharp sounds,"
1,Only works if your dog is stuffed,"I have several of these. Unfortunately, I purchased them all at one time, hoping to put them in various areas of the house. I have FIVE dogs. Doesn't work with ANY of them. It did --- for a few hours --- but they seem to get used to the high pitched (we can't hear it) sound, and they ignore it. Don't waste your money."
3,multiple dog review,"we have multiple dogs, so we thought we would try this product. Unfortunately, the dog that barked the most was not affected. Our Queensland Heeler was punished everytime the other dog barked. Would not use this product with multiple dogs of mixed breeds."
3,bark control device,"this worked perfectly on one dog - she hasn't barked at all ! the second dog barked less but simply lowered her "" tone "" so the device wouldn't emit the sound .... too smart . the third dog ....it didn't phase him at all , he just kept barking . One out of three ?"
2,Not with my dogs,"For 27 bucks figured this was worth a try. Dogs were startled first time I used it, and now just ignore it. If this does work for you, be aware that it's set off by any loud sound (kids yelling, etc.)"
2,doesn't work for me.,"PetSafe Indoor Bark Control. I don't know if we have it set up right, but my dogs don't seem to mind the ultra sonic sound it emits at all. They still bark just as long when someone comes in the house."
2,IT DOES NOT WORK,The indoor bark control does not seem to be working. I don't know if I got a faulty one or what but I got no response to my first inquiry to the company. I would not advise this product.Amazon Verified PurchaseAnn Sale
1,worked for a week,Bought this over a year ago. it worked for a week. Every time my dog would bark it set it off and he would instantly stop to turn around and face it. I think it was more curiosity than anything. After a week he could be standing right by it and not care that the device was being set off. I own a Miniature Pinscher.
2,not so hot,I wasnt very impressed with this item. It seemed to make a difference for about a day. The dogs stopped and looked around to see what it was. And overnite they didn't care that it was there. So I'm back to square one...
2,How do you know it's working? My dog acts like it doesn't,"When we first used in on our 1 yo yapping Bichon, he seemed to look around to see what it was. That lasted about a day. After that, no matter if we were pushing the manual button close to him, he didn't bat an eye. We have no idea if it was working. I would have returned it but - of course - we lost the receipt."
2,"Dog interested in noise, not detered from barking","My beagle (13 mo.) cocks her head showing that she hears something with a slight pause in the barking process but does not deter her from barking at a later time. Does nothing for howling and will only go off for loud barks, not smaller barking or any form of whining (even if extremely loud)."
1,Don't waste your time or money.,Our dogs didn't even notice it. We have three small terriers and I thought this would be a suitable device for a few house slippers. I was wrong - the kept on barking...
5,no more doggy fueds with neighbor,"i absolutely love this product. my neighbor has four little yippers and my shepard/chow mix was antogonized by the yipping on our side of the fence. I hung the device on my side of the fence and the noise keeps the neighbors dog from picking ""arguments"" with my dog. all barking and fighting has ceased. all the surrounding neighbor as well as me can get a good nights sleep now."
4,Success is dependent on dog temperament,"This product worked great for me. I have a 5 year old schnauzer-poodle mix who I recently adopted from a shelter. Overall she is very laid back and sleeps most of the day, but at times she gets nervous and has major separation anxiety. When I left her sight for even 5 seconds she would burst into a fit of LOUD barking. She is also very eager to please which is probably why this product works.I practiced saying ""quiet"" before pressing the button when she barked in my presence so she associated the command (that she knew fairly well) with the sound. After this brief warming up period I left my house with the device on, and to my amazement - silence.I can see how this would not work as well with a group of dogs or with very stubborn/high energy dogs. I would give it a 5/5 stars but the device does not have an on/off switch... you have to take out the battery."
1,This doesn't work AT ALL!,This just hasn't worked one little bit. My dog doesn't even hear it when she is barking! It clearly makes a sound that she can hear (when she is quiet and I press it to check its working) but she barks more loudly than the device apparently.
2,Bark Control,"I purchased this bark control because a friend of mine told me about it. I have a 7 year old Papillion who barks quite a bit when no one pays attention to her. It is most annoying. So, I bought this bark control thinking it would help out but unfortunately, for me , it just didn't work."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"We are not sure there is any direct effect on our dogs from this unit. The little red light lights up when we push the button, but there is no reaction from the dogs so we do not think there is any signal. New batteries don't make any difference. We did not get the effect I hoped to have from this unit."
1,Doesn't work,"And I don't mean it didn't fix my dog (this kind of thing only works on a % of dogs anyway). It does not emit an ultrasonic sound, at least my unit doesn't, unless I push the button on top. Even then, about half the time the light goes on and my dog looks up; the rest of the time it doesn't even pretend it is making noise. But it has not once worked in response to my dog's barking. I'd send it back if I had kept the packaging."
5,This thing is great.,"I love this, I have 2 dogs (1 small and 1 big) and live in a duplex. My little dog still barks but not like she used to, it has worked great on my big dog to. It has helped my dogs from barking everytime my neighbor goes in or out, and it also has helped her dog from barking."
1,Not worth it,"I found that it did nothing to keep my dogs from barking. Even though I placed it in close proximity to where they bark, it did not work at all. My daughter however, complained that it botheres ""Her"" ears."
2,Depends on the dog...keep the receipt,I have 2 dogs- one of them (the one that doesn't bark!)was very afraid of it and stopped doing whatever she was doing when the device went off. The puppy thought it would be fun to bark at the device. The other problem is that the device did not sound when the puppy barked. It only went off when I press the button or when people are talking loudly. It is going back to the store and we are trying something different.
1,Ultrasonic sound? how do we know?,"This never worked once, but it did drain 4 batteries in the short time we tried to use it. Very disappointing. I would reccommend spending your money some place else."
2,Worked the first few days,"This bark control worked the first few days, then my dog just started ignoring it. Not sure how this product can be made better, may be it can bark back at the dog? who knows ...."
1,Waste of money.,"Simply does not work, my 3 dogs do not even realize it is in room. Keep your money and time."
1,Ugh,Doesnt affect my dogs at all.Nor does the bird house one either a big waists of money. Please return my money.
2,Petsafe Bark Control,"It works until the dog gets used to it, which takes a few days. Thereafter it's ineffective. Can't recommend it."
1,didn't phase my shih tzu,"My 9 month old shih tzu has a barking problem. A friend of mine told me about an ultrasonic bark control for indoors, and I was so looking forward to this helping my dog stop incessant barking. To no avail. I followed directions. My dog isn't phased by this product, so I can only assume it doesn't work. The red light blinks like it is going off, although, I wouldn't know for sure because the product is not created for me to hear the alert that goes off. Unfortunately, this is a dud."
1,Petsafe Ultrasonc indoor bark control,"So far it has been my experience that this item does not work , It does not appear to have any effect on the dogs barking."
2,Didn't Work for JRT,"This product did not diminish my dog's barking. He's a Jack Russell terrier, so maybe they are more stubborn?If possible, I think a person should either borrow one & try it out, or buy it at a place where it would be easy to return, in case your dog is like mine."
1,"I bought 3 of these, THE DON'T STOP BARKING","FIRST, DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE! I have purchased 3 of these devices at once. I SURROUNDED the dogs (in their area) with these devices and they simply ignore them and continue barking. I have a feeling the the auto-detect feature works sporadically, at best. The manual button works, but it still does not stop the barking. The dogs will most likely notice the sound at first, ignore it, and continue barking. Also, you will spend a lot of money on batteries, as they seem to wear out quickly. ONE of these devices SHOULD work for barking dogs, and I bought THREE at once, and the barking continues. Please, save your money for something else (Ex: A Citronella Collar)."
1,Look for another one,"We are trying to stop our dogs barking during the day, but they will not stop! This device will turn on when they bark (the red light turns on) and they do not pay attention to it whatsoever. We are returning the item and trying to look for another solution."
1,bark control,The product rates a zero. It says it works for all breeds of dogs but it doesnt. It doesnt pick up the barks from poms even when 3 of them are barking right next to it.
1,BAD,"I thought since my dog is locked up in a small area this devise should work, but I was wrong. I would never buy this product and would never recommend to anybody. First of all the battery doesn't fit and I had to put a little peace of paper so it wouldn't fall out and would stay in place, which didn't really work well either. My dog doesn't bark too much but still this product didn't help at all, don't waste your time and money."
1,Didn't work,"Didn't work with my dogs...tried putting it in all different locations (on the floor, by the door, on a shelf)...always facing the dogs and never went off. The first one I got I sent back because I thought it was malfunctioning, so I was sent a second one...worked slightly better, but neither would go off when my dogs park. Needless to say, sent the second one back too and got a full refund. Loved ordering through amazon though, great exchange/return service!"
1,Not pleased at all,"I was not pleased with this purchase at all. First of all, I ordered it and after one month I got an email saying it hadn't even been confirmed by the seller. I had to write an email to him to get him to send it out, I was actually going to cancel the order because it was taking too long. I finally received it about a month and a half to 2 months after ordering it. I know it depends on the dog whether it will work or not and that it might not work for your dog. I have a 1 year old cocker spaniel and it doesn't phase him at all. It did at first but he just keeps barking and doesn't pay attention to it. I would not recommend this purchase."
1,Not worth the price of free shipping,Sorry I wasted my money. Surely not worth the price to ship back. Did absolutely nothing to stop barking.
1,Does not work for my dogs.,"Bought this at a risk since it seems it's a hit or miss for a lot of people. When I first turned it on, my Chihuahua mix perked up and was wondering where the sound was coming from. However, this did not deter them from barking at all - actually caused them to bark even more. Back to Amazon!"
2,Not worth it,"When our phone rang, it would set off the bark monitor every time. This defeated the training purpose of the device. Also? It chewed through batteries super fast b/c it was always going off from the phone ringing, the train going by, etc. Our dog became a nervous wreck, never knowing when that awful high-pitched sound was going to go off. Not worth it!"
1,product sucks,this thing is a joke - does not work at all and if anything makes the dogs bark more!!! UGH!!! not worth a penny!
2,Not effective,"My dog barks crazy only when I'm alway from home. So I purchased this product hoping that this could help my dog stop barking. Unfortunately, this product did not help at all. It is easy to set up and working fine as I see the light blinking everytime my dog barks), but he doesn't seem to care and keeps barking. This product is not effective and helpful for my dog."
1,Compete Junk.,"May work for some dogs, but those dogs are the one's that respond to a verbal ""shhhh"". This is complete junk in my opinion. Don't waste your money."
4,Fantastic! Totally works!,"This is the best thing I've purchased in ages -- I can't believe I waited so long to get it. My mini poodle would bark every time someone passed my apartment door, which was okay during the day but NOT fun at 3 am! She barked once and then totally stopped -- now she'll make a small rumble-y noise, but no more middle-of-the-night barking at the front door for 5 minutes. The only negative is that the 25 ft range is definitely true -- she knows now that she can't bark by the front door, but she can bark in the living room. But it works so well that I'm buying a second one to put there!"
1,Absolute junk,This thing does not work at all. A complete piece of junk. My 2 dogs never even noticed it when they bark.
1,"PetSafe Ultrasonic Indoor Bark Control, PBC-1000","I bought this to help stop the barking of two yappy Italian Greyhounds. It blinks nicely when they bark, but did not in anyway phase the dogs to stop barking. When I made the purchase, the review I read for the product where 50/50 on how well the bark control worked, so shame on me for buying.PetSafe Ultrasonic Indoor Bark Control, PBC-1000"
1,No effect on Dachshunds,"This product did not work on our miniature dachshunds. A ""sound"" bark collar worked better but could only be left on for short periods or our dog became ""cowed."" Also, the product needs an on/off switch. Taking the battery out to turn it off is a pain."
1,Does NOT Work,We bought this product hoping it would help us train our dogs not to bark so much or just not in certain areas of the house. It did not work at all. They never even noticed it was in the room. I would not recommend it. Huge waste of money!
1,Did not work for my Beagle mix,"I have a two-year-old Beagle mix who likes to bark at the neighborhood dogs and cats outside the window. I received this unit, installed the battery, and waited. Eventually, my dog started barking and the unit responded (the LED turns red when the unit emits a tone). My dog was not fazed at all, nor was my girlfriend's Bichon who was also in the room. Perhaps this unit works on other breeds and sizes of dogs, but it did not work at all on my dog."
3,Maybe It Works?,"Although I read the reviews saying it may not work with a Terrier, we bought it anyway for our fox terrier/schnauzer mix. We're going to give it a couple of more weeks to see if it truly reduces the amount of barking. After using it for about 1 week it's hard to tell if it has had any effect."
2,Bark Control Review,"We saw this product work at someone else's home when our dogs were also there. The barking of four dogs was quickly controlled. However, after purchasing for our own home, it only actually worked on one of our chihuahua's. Our other chihuahua would get angry at it and bark at the controller each time it emitted the sound. That put undue stress on our other chihuahua (the one that didn't bark) -- so we had to remove the batteries."
2,Able to sleep! {For a week},"We bought this for our well-mannered, but noisy in the mornings, puppy. We saw immediate results. No more waking up to him barking in the mornings - now he stays quiet in his crate until we get up and let him out.---Updated review: After about a week, the box no longer deterred our puppy from barking in the mornings. The sound did not annoy him enough to keep him from activating it with his barks."
2,Bark or not,"I have a 85lb German Sheppard, 100lb Mastiff/St. Bernard, 40lb Beagle, 12lb Jack Russell, and a 6lb Mini Dachshund. When one barks, they all chime in. I bought two units and placed them at different places in the same room. The units seem minimally effective on their own. I know they work well if you hold the unit and press button while dogs are barking, but that could be b/c I am actually present and they are aware I want the barking stopped. The dogs seem not to care about the units if they are not attended too; my smallest dog is not only unfazed by these units but her bark pitch does not set the unit off.Overall, I would not spend the money on these and might investigate other alternatives to the units."
2,Worked at first,"We have two small dogs who's barking is annoying. We purchased the PatSafe hoping........., but our hopes weren't answered. It seemed to work on one, but just for awhile. The other dog never did pay attention to the device. Would like to return it."
4,"So far, so good","I have a Min Pin and this product works. Our busy-body neighbor thought we got rid of the dog. I got it about 3 weeks ago and ""Mo"" has stopped barking in the house. I don't know whether he gets the audio signal just in our formal living room only where the unit is located, but he doesn't bark in other rooms either. I'm hoping the sensitivity doesn't wear off and the barking begins again. So far, so good. But I would prefer a product that has an ON/OFF switch; our infant granddaughter comes and I have to remove the battery. I would (and have) recommended this product to others; it's worth the reasonable price."
3,"Why no ""OFF"" switch?","This product is a great idea. I bought this for my two Bichons, who seem to bark loudly and incessantly when people come for a visit. It seems to stop them immediately . I would have added a star if it only had an ""off"" switch. The only way to deactivate it is by pulling the battery. There are times when dog barking is appropriate, especially when they hear strangers. I would not recommend leaving it out and ""ON"" all the time."
2,Didn't help :(,I bought this because a friend swears by the outdoor one made by same company. But it doesn't seem to be helping with my small indoor dogs.
1,not effective,"We have 2 dogs, a Golden Retriever and a Poodle-mix, who both think that they have to defend the house when someone walks by; it irritates us, and the person going by. We will not use bark-collars, so I was happy to find the Ultrasonic Indoor Bark Contol, and ordered it as soon as I discovered it. We have had it about 6 weeks, and it has been totally ineffective. We tried different locations, and different angles, but it simply did not make any difference. The battery had to be replaced within this 6 week period, although they say that it should last longer. It's not the end of the world, but we are very disappointed in this product, and would certainly not recommend it based upon our own experiences."
1,Doesnt work as it should,It doesn't really works by itself.The microphone doesn't pick up the barking.I have a 5 month yorky and even hold the thing right in front of the dog and it did nothing.Now if you wanna use it manually then it does work.But it doesn't work on its own.
3,not as good as outdoor ultrasonic bark controller,"THE PETSAFE PBC-1000 STATIONARY BARK CONTROLLER DOESN'T WORK NEARLY AS WELL AS THE OUTDOOR BIRDHOUSE STYLE BARK CONTROLLER. THE NOISE THAT THE STATIONARY STYLE EMITS DOESN'T SEEM TO BOTHER MY DOGS. THE OUTDOOR BIRDHOUSE WORKS WONDERS, MY DOGS WON'T BARK AT ALL OUTSIDE. THEREFORE I WOULD BUY THE BIRDHOUSE FOR INSIDE TOO, INSTEAD OF THE STATIONARY STYLE. HEIDI, FROM NEVADA"
3,Bark Control- PetSafe,"Does not quite work like advertised. Monitor needs to bewithin a few feet of pet to set off electronically. Worksbetter manually, as a training aid. Manufacturer really needsto look at the design of the product, larger sensor to allow formonitor to pick up barking in an area further than a few feet. Ifyou were to place it on a counter while at work, this product wouldnot deliver the results needed to deter your pet from barking. Asadvertised 10 feet, is grossly exaggerated, more like 2 to 3 feetmaybe."
3,It almost worked,It worked great for a few days and then the dogs figured it out and just bark anyway. The good thingis that is does slow them down. Now it is a few barks and then wait to see what is going to happen and then a few more. Before it was non stop for hours. So yes it works but not a good as I had hoped. Just be aware that it really depends on the dog.
2,just didn't work,i give it 2 stars only because it didn't really work for my dog. he keeps on barking anyway. as others have said before all you can do is try it and see if it will actually work for your dog.
3,Effective if.....,Effective but needs to be directed a dog - may be animal specific on this. Barking decreased w two prong approach with instrument and personal displeasure voice with activity. Still a barker - old dog may take longer.
1,a blinking box,The blinking light drew my dogs attention. He barked at the light every time it flashed. Quickly grew tired of it and then I had no effect on him at all.
1,didn't work,"did not help at all! dog had no reaction to.it, and it would not.pick up his bark! don't buy, save your money!"
2,Does not work!,Our dog is not influenced by the devise. He continues to bark as much as ever. Would not recommend it.
2,Didn't work for us.,"We bought this for our dachshund, did not deter barking at all. When the dog did bark, the cat would bear it and freak out."
1,Don't buy it,"Completely useless for our 25 lb dog. He doesn't even notice it or doesn't care. Also, he starts with whining and howling, and can be quite loud at it. The unit doesn't even activate for this kind of noice. if you have a howler, don't even think that this will help keep him quiet."
1,Didn't Work For Me,"I bought this to stop my little dog's yapping. The first time I used it, she was startled and stopped barking. But that was the only time I noticed anything. I tried it for a week and saw no change. It sure didn't work for me. I quit using it."
2,It Works Sometimes,"My dog isn't a bark enthusiast; however, he'll once in awhile go nuts when someone passes by my house or when I leave him alone in his pen. So when I got this product I tried it out immediately & he stopped barking. He looked a bit confused and curious at the same time at the device. So it worked for a bit in the beginning. I noticed now, if my dog is in a very hyper mood this device won't stop him from barking. I can also hear the high pitch sound. It doesn't hurt my ears unless I put it directly to my ear. So if you have a dog that looooves to bark constantly, this product isn't for you. I also have another dog at my parent's house that is spoiled rotten and loves to bark at anyone & at anything. So when I used it on him, he got mad...growled at me & then continued barking like crazy. As a result, this product won't work for my parent's dog but it works on my dog...sometimes."
1,MONEY WASTED,"The gizmo I received does not work. The only way it activates is when I manually press the button. My dog's barking does not activate the deterrent. I tried yelling into the unit and it does nothing. It seems as though it might have an effect if it would work when he barks because when I manually activate the unit, he is obviously distracted from barking... but that is not the purpose of this machine. I can't run for the machine every time he starts barking. So I do not recommend this product to anyone. UPDATE: The product finally did work once... the sound activation reacted to my dog's barking... so I'm not totally giving up and I wanted to be fair."
2,Bark all you want. I don't work!,"As the title states ""I don't work"". Had NO effect whatsoever. Purchase and deliverywent fine (so did my money). Would not recommend such a device, period!"
2,bark controller?,"On time, what was in the description. Doesn't stop my dogs from barking, maybe workds for some, not me"
1,not our dogs,"This didn't deter our two yorkie-poos one bit. At first, they would twist their head in a curious way and wonder what the heck it was, but eventually they learned that it was ""nothing"". We've since bought the remote shock collar to control their behavior which has worked wonders."
1,Worthless,"This product was so worthless. I bought it at Petco to try to cure my Pomeranian mix's need to bark at everything in sight, his own reflection, and every little sound! Well, go figure it turned out to be a wasted trip. I used the manual function...no results. Tried the automatic function and again, nothing. I immediately returned it for a refund."
4,Very Interesting,"Lewis Thomas takes a simple observation, like the report on pollution, and changes the reader's perception. In one of his essays, he chastises the reader on his or her selfishness with a fiery passion. Thomas convinces the reader of the ideas inferred with his scientific observations, the theme of this book being the major human fault: striving to reach perfection. The essays are short, abrupt but leave you to ponder your own interactions in life, nature."
3,Enjoyable at times,"I thought his first volume of essays - THE LIVES OF A CELL - was more interesting, but there are still some essays here that will stimulate the reader to ponder the biology Thomas discusses."
5,Terrific,"This is a great book. I wish I had known about it years ago. Lewis Thomas is just a great writer, full of personality and wonder. The first thing you should read is the essay on warts. I know. Why would anyone write about warts? It's one of the finest pieces of writing I've read, and I recommend it to anyone. Uplifting, makes you proud (and humble) to be a human being."
5,Incredible depth in such a small book,"This collection of essays or thoughts or whatever it is classified as is wonderfully honest and simple. Thomas brings a certain wit and charm to some complex and taboo subjects such as dying, disease, warts, etc that allows you to totally disconnect and look at the big picture. For college folk out there the section on 'premeds' is especially funny."
3,Okay...,"Question: What's the difference between the Crema Bryte Scaper and a common paint scraper you would use on windows?Answer: Packaging.If you already have a paint scraper, it's the same retractable razor blade arrangment, so just use that. The pads are useful in saving elbow grease compared to scrubbing with a paper towel, but the secret in either case is using a cleaning solution designed for ceramic oven tops, which of course Cerama sells. But so does the grocery and many hardware retailers. You really don't need to send off and pay a premium for this."
3,Nothing a razor can't fix.,"This isn't necessarily a bad product, it's simply a razor with a handle attached to it. The scratch pad is fairly low quality though. I can quickly remove set-in stains off my ceramic stove with the scraper, but I don't wake up every morning thankful that this product has come into my life. Then again, if you are a terrible cook like me and always make a mess, it is definitely handy to have."
3,Not as good as I thought,The scraper works ok. Maybe I waited too long to get one and now the stains on my cooktop won't come off. So maybe it works better if you use it right after you've spilled something.
3,Scraper not good,The scraper does not work well. The price is low but the quality is not good.Anastassia
5,excellent for glass top watch price u pay,"The scraper works great it is a razor blade in a plastic handle. So the handle wont scratch the stove top. I saw this scraper @ a few different home stores for around five bucks. Cheaper once you include shipping. I paid double once I added shipping. Don't get bit like I did, good product just watch the price + shipping."
5,Great Tool,"Item arrived very quickly! Exactly as described. Very satisfied with the purchase. Also, the Cerma Bryte Scraper is an excellent tool, don't know how I had a flat top stove without it!"
2,Not product as displayed,"This was not the product as displayed on the website, so I returned it. Called the manufacturer and was told they no longer make the one shown on the website (not their problem)."
3,cant really review,"I tried ordering this but it ended up selling out and no back orders were available. No big deal, I already switched the seat covers and all inside my car anyways."
3,Pizza w/grandpa,"I bought this for my grandchild's grandpa. The 16 month old likes these lift the flap books. But as grandpa doesn't cook, and the book is all about making pizza w/grandpa, I wouldn't have purchased it if I had known that. If you have a grandpa that makes pizza, go for it."
4,Magic and Pulp Adventure combined!,"Stretching the boundaries of the term ""Alternate History"" -- in a sort of Thirty's pulp fiction,and Doc Savage in particular, way -- there's the book Doc Sidhe, by Aaron Allston.Basically, imagine Doc Savage as an elf.The Elven (or ""Fair"") world is much like ours (the ""Grim World""). In fact, it's history is a slightlytwisted copy of ours, but ""running"" about sixty years behind (they're in the middle of adepression, had a major war fifteen years previous, and so on).It's a fun book, and a nice homage to the Doc Savage series without being so much of a copy as tobe a parody, or to be unable to stand on it's own."
4,Super Reader,"Imagine if there was a counter earth, stuck in the 30s, where, basically, elves and trolls are real.The coolest thing, however, is that Doc Savage is real, too. Except for the fact he is a Daoine Sidhe sorcerer, and has a higher mortality rate for his crew.A down on his luck kickboxer and his girlfriend end up there, via a conjurer's circle, and a plot to change the magical rules of relations between the two worlds.Oh, and the evil villain is Doc's son. This is an excellent homage, a good urban fantasy, and a bit of the Untouchables, to boot. As in, it don't end happily for everyone.If you like the sound of that, easy to check out, it is a Baen Free Library book :-"
3,Pretty good.,Wish it was a bit larger. My cheese tends to bunch up inside in a ball if i don't remember to grate a little at a time. I would buy it again though. I like how the bottom is closed off until you are ready to use it.
4,Perfect for Small Hands & 2 cups,"I have skinned my knuckles and bleed pools of.... err...wait...I have owned numerous graters.All have been BIG.This one is cute small.What I Like:+ Cute Small+ See Through, I can See the Cheese+ Has a non-slip rubber grip bottom+ Can open bottom over the cooking vessel+ Plastic side comes off for cleaning"
5,Terrific staple and super well-priced,We were very pleased with the extremely fast arrival of this item for reupholstering our kitchen table's dining chairs with vinyl (less than 24 hours w/o paying for 1-day shipping; just using the 2-day Prime!). It swiftly punched through the vinyl and held it firmly to the chair. We passed up on a weaker but more expensive craft staple gun at the craft store since this appeared to be a better deal (after researching comparable products on the Amazon.com mobile app). The handy storage case and ample supply of staples made this an even greater buy for us. Overall excellent product and value.
5,AWESOME product! GREAT bargain!,"I took my new staple gun to a craft meeting and everyone used it with no problems whatsoever. At just under $13 with tons of staples and a neat little carrying case, I have to say that it was one of my better purchases in the past year!"
1,Broke on first use,"The very first time I attempted to use this staple gun, which was to staple a few spots on a strand of Christmas lights to hold them to a wooden fence, the spring mechanism that feeds the staples exploded out of the gun and was lost somewhere in my yard. I am unable to find it to see if I can even put it back together. It may have been a fluke accident or something, but I am not impressed and will likely not be purchasing another Stanley staple gun."
3,Very Light Duty,"This stapler is is pretty dinky. It's likely my fault for not taking the Light Duty in the title a seriously as I should have. This thing is great for hanging posters, but that's probably about it. I wish I'd gone for something a little more heavy duty. One design flaw I've noticed is that you can't lock the trigger back down into the loop without firing off a wasted staple. Doesn't make much sense, but it's not that big of a deal."
5,light duty stapler,"Am very happy with this stapler. For light duty it works very well,easy to squeeze handle. It came with staples and a nice case."
2,Only for Basic Use...,really flimsey and cheaply made. you're almost better off using an opened desktop stapler... doh!get the bigger version:(
3,It's very sturdy,"But also very tough. I have small hands and this takes a little effort. But once I figured it out, it worked great! I just wish it was quite as tough. My fingers did hurt the next couple days after working on this. FYI."
4,Vitrolin linament,We purchase this linament for my father. He uses it for his arthritis and loves it. My mother also uses it to repel insects and says it helps a lot. We purchase it by the gallon so apparently it works for both of them.
2,Diasppointed,"I looked forward to reading Out of the Ruins, as I had read the first three of the Ben Reese mysteries in quick secession on my Kindle and liked them all very much. This book was so different that it seems as if a different person wrote all the narrative parts about Cumberland Island (and the travelogue through other parts of the south) and then Ms. Wright just filled in the action scenes that involved Ben Reese. I found this book so difficult to read that if it had been the first one of the Ben Reese books I had read, it would have been the last. I persevered to the end because I wanted to see how Ben Reese solved the mystery, but it was hard going."
3,"Politics, religion and mystery","I've read several in this series. She tells a good story, and if you can imagine Ayn Rand as a Christian fundamentalist, you will absolutely adore her politics and religion."
2,"Sally Wright, please . . .","Sally Wright, you don't have to hit us over the head with a character's accent. I was so put off by ""nevuh,"" ""eithuh,"" etc. that I couldn't finish this book. All you have to do is say that one of your characters speaks with a soft Southern drawl and let your readers do the rest. In the previous Ben Reese mysteries, which I enjoyed for the most part, I got very tired of ""a-tall,"" but I didn't quit reading. Not so with Out of the Ruins."
5,Out of the Ruins,"Each of this series was extremely well written. Kept one guessing as to what would happen next. Reading out of order didn't seem to spoil the ending. The reader was entertained throughout and enjoyed the humor, intellect, and mystery as presented by Ms. Wright."
4,Sally Wright mysteries,"I have read the whole Ben Reese mystery series by Sally Wright and have enjoyed every one. She never repeats herself - each plot is unique - and Ben Reese is a very interesting character with a very compelling back story (which you will find in the prequel, Code of Silence). The other characters are equally interesting. The locales vary from Onio to Scotland to South Carolina as well as the battlefields of World War II. If you're looking for an interesting, leisure-time book series, take a look at the Ben Reese mysteries."
1,This is an Insulting Book,"I found this to be an insulting book as her main advice seems to be: get rid of your possessions & you won't have clutter.Summery of her advice regarding collections: why collect salt shakers they're hard to clean & dirt gets in the holes -- you only need 3 pair of salt shakers -- table, stove & matches the good china.I guess she had to write more than a one paragraph book such as:""Get rid of everything and you won't have any clutter or stuff to worry about organizing."" But a short book like that wouldn't have sold.If you want to read a really good book that, among other great advice, will actually tell you how to display a collection read Linda Cobb's, ""The Queen of Clean Conquers Clutter."" Her's is a 5+ star book."
2,Not for visual learners,I bought this book almost a year ago and really tried to make use of it. Although it's obvious that the author has extensive photography knowledge I don't think he did a very good job of passing it on to the beginner. He gives really no diagrams for lighting set up or any other beginning helps. If you are like me and really are a visual self learner and an absolute beginner to photography I would not recommend buying this book.
1,Very Disappointed,"This book was not very helpful. While the table of contents looks promising, the content is not what was expected. For example, the author describes the use of flags and cookies to adjust the amount of light reaching a subject, but never shows details of how this is done. While there are tons of pictures to give examples, there are none of the lighting setups. Occasionally there is a flat drawing, but that is all.The book uses call-outs to highlight what should be important information. However, the text that was used seems to be just a cut and paste ezperiment, with no basis for the choice of text. Rarely is the text worth reading. let alone remembering.Hopefully I will find the book that I thought this was - a beginner's guide to studio lighting."
2,This book is as difficult to use as the Adobe program,"I have basic Acrobat PDF skills and was looking for a Sam's Learn Acrobat in 24 hours or Acrobat for Dummies type book, but not one of those really fluffy, basic, picture story books. This is the closest I could find and it isn't close. Disappointing - crammed and densely packed with information, I found this book difficult to navigate and use, and similar to using Acrobat itself--so you might as well just muddle through the program and its help files directly rather than muddle through this book. It may be good for mature intermediate or advanced Adobe practitioners as a reference or review, but if you're looking for a teach yourself book along the lines of the SAMs, ...for Dummies, or the Microsoft press books, my suggestion is don't bother with this Acrobat PDF Bible. I'll try to avoid using Acrobat until SAMs or some other publisher comes out with a self-teaching guide."
2,Who will use it?,"Just Ok.....You can glean a lot from reading the Adobe help pdf first....Since there is no other book on Acrobat 5, I give it 2 stars...If you are looking to really learn Acrobat, be ready to devoted hours, days, weeks, months, years to be a really good user. To just casually use Acrobat, you don't need the book. And if you're up to par, you don't need it either."
4,Adobe Acrobat 5 PDF Bible,I am an ACE in Acrobat. This book is a 4 star+. Ted did an excellent job in building what he started in the last book. Acrobat is so much more powerful than 95% of the people realize. This book reveals most of the power in a very organized fashion. This is a necessity for anyone that works with Acrobat.
1,Pointless,"I dont get it, this author had a perfectly good subject matter and well he demonized it by his splatterpunk vagueness and boring storyline. This book was all over the place, I really wanted the demons to just kill everyone because I frankly could have cared less by the 3rd chapter what happened to these people. Was it trying to be horror? or a spiritual warning? or was it trying to be a page filler because thats what it turned out to be."
1,Not worth it,"This was my first John Shirley book, and I have to say I was bored. It started off interesting enough, but I had to force myself to see it through. It kind of reminded me of a conspiracy theory book, where an evil corporation use psychonomics, and as a result turns certain people into demonic creatures that terrorize the world, but not how the synopsis on the back of the book would have you believe. The character development I felt was lacking as well. I am no expert on literature or the like,this is just my opinion."
2,Illuminati Redux?,"I like John Shirley as a writer, I really do. I will emphasize that I prefer his horror writing, as I am not much of a science fiction fan. So, reading the back of the book, I was expecting something that managed to be nasty and thought-provoking at the same time. But to me this book smacked of Robert Anton Wilson's Illuminati books, which meant it definitely was not to my taste. It even had a bit of Wilson's slapdash quality to it, although for the most part I considered it well-written."
3,"I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if possible...good, could have been great!","There were very interesting ideas in this book, as well as a couple of great ""moments."" But I was expecting more of a horror novel and less of a philisophical/science fiction/environmental/political novel. There were basically no demons in the 2nd part of the story!! A couple of scenes, sure, but overall, it was much slower paced than the first part. I really liked the idea of a secretive group of people joined via special powers, and liked the character of Ira. Also enjoyed the dialogue from some of the demons - creepy and funny all at once. I recommend this book, but be warned it's not what you expect."
2,Just fair to middlin',"I'd like to say this was terrific, cause the story itself sounded great. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish it. The story didn't keep my attention and there was just not a lot there.If you really want to get this, I'd recommend the book, not the audio tape. Its entirely possible that I was annoyed at the reader's voice more than the story."
1,REALLY Demons,"I am a huge fan of Fiction just reading someone's visions of Demons can be a real blast but not this book...I knew this was not the Book for me when the Demon killed the President of the Untied States with his Demon ""MANHOOD"" I am being nice in my words here...Give me a break really, how old are we this is something a 12 years says in a group of buddies cuz it is ridiculous....The endless killing with no commutation between the Demons and the humans was like a video game non stop killing...WHY is all I can say, this book is just not for me I like a story to go with my Demons...."
1,HORROR BOOK,I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK. IT WASN'T WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AT ALL. NOTHING WRONG WITH THE SELLER. I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THE BOOK. I WOULD BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN. JUST DON'T BUY THIS BOOK.
4,A Fine Horror Novel from John Shirley,"While ""Demons"" may lack the intense machine-gun narrative of John Shirley's ""A Song Called Youth"" cyberpunk trilogy, it nonetheless is a splendid example of his fine literary style which has garnered praise from distinguished writers ranging from William Gibson to Clive Barker. I found ""Demons"" to be a riveting read, especially Book 1, which is a phantasmagorical trek through San Francisco in the midst of a demonic occupation. Book 2 adds some intriguing touches with regards to cyperpunk and environmental disaster fiction thrown into a plot which shows what happens when big business runs afoul of demons. Melissa, the daughter of an obscure college professor, is the main character - and emotional heart - of both books. Shirley's prose has rarely been better. This is yet another fine book from one of my favorite authors of fiction."
3,impossible to play,"This is a nice piece. However, it is written for people who can stretch their fingers 10 to 13 keys apart. I've played piano since I was four and it is quite frustrating when the keys are too far apart that it's impossible to play."
4,Good Book,"This book was full of pictures about Centralia, PA if you are looking for more info get this book."
5,a diamond in the rough,"Paladin press publishes a lot of crap from charlatains and armchair, wanna- be tough guys. This book is an exception. Jim Arvanitis has been around for a long time and the techniques presented in this book are top notch. A lot of martial arts books suck because they are poorly written and have photos of techniques which are almost impossible to follow. Mr. Arvanitis' book however, has very good step by step photos of his applications, as well as very well articulated explainations for them. This book is worth every penny you'll pay for it an you'll keep it around for reference for many years. I suggest you buy it ASAP, or better yet- find a Pankration teacher ASAP! Pankration is effective for self defense, fitness AND the ring, and very few fighting arts can claim ALL of that."
5,One of the Best,"I bought this book as a guide to Jim's video series at the recommendation of Massad Ayoob. It is Pure gold. Pankration is not flashy, and is, at it's core, very similar to modern MMA. The addendum of Spartan options are for street defense. Arvantisis teaches everything: history, standing, grappling, and technique. The Spartan options, as mentioned earlier, are optional for a street encounter. If you have any boxing or wrestling experience in your past and wish to learn a viable martial art then pankration is just for you!"
5,ADDICTING GAME FOR ALL AGES,This game is an absolute blast! It is quite simple to play andso incredibly addicting. My daughter which is 5 and son which is3 1/2 find this game very compelling and fun. My husband and I can't put it down. Great gift for all ages.
2,He needs Tina Fey's writing,"i love tracy on 30 Rock. I did not understand till watching this solo show of his how much he needed Tina Fey's writing talent. Fey has made both Morgan and Alec Baldwin comedic darlings due to the writing of her sitcom. She was formerly a writer and performer for SNL. she is also a character on the show but is a comedic foil for them, not competition.left to his own writing devices, tracy morgan descends to a very raunchy, foul mouthed stand up act which is a very poor imitation of what comedic giants have done so much better before him, including richard pryor and george carlin. if you want to see someone who does raunchy present day a whole heck. of a lot better, go watch Louis CK's standup shows,if you buy this on dvd or instant, i think you will feel you wasted your money by the time the show is over."
4,Only Flaw Is The Price,"This is one of the better DA full lengths.The Standout track obviously is ""Grateful Days"".All The other songs are great to.I would suggest the ""Lilly Of Da Valley"" before this one.However this is great also.However the price is robbery.I know that this is imported but..."
3,Poker De Ases,"Not much to say about this movie, the story was fair, the actors played their parts well,Luis Aguilar, the actor in this dvd, played a good roll in this story."
4,Good hands-free lighting,My boy scout son enjoyed using this product on a camp out. It uses regular batteries so no need to buy special ones. The battery cover broke when we were practicing how to use the light and change the batteries. Amazon was great about sending a replacement. Unit emits a bright light and is adjustable to any head size. It is easy to adjust the direction of the light beam. A good choice for the price.
1,Buyer Beware!,"Although this book is called ""Easy Guide to the Panov-Botvinnik Attack"" it is anything but an ""Easy Guide"". Rather, it is in the words of the book itself a ""detailed, systematic coverage"". The book presupposes an already existing knowledge of the Caro-Kann and the Panov. I am not saying that this is a bad book. For those with extensive and expert knowledge of chess it may very well be a great book, I don't know. But one thing I do know is that it is NOT an ""Easy Guide"", don't be fooled by the title when you buy this book!"
3,"Not bad, but could have been better.","If you want to learn the specifics of the Panov-Botvinnik Attack, you really can't do without this book--perfect though it may not be. But when an author looks really deeply into IQP positions--e.g. as Baburin does in Winning Pawn Structures--it can make Aagard's treatment look somewhat shallow and offhanded by comparison."
5,I miss Senora but I love this book!,"I love Lynn Hightower's writing. She is one of my most favorite writers. After reading Debt Collector I couldn't wait for another ""Senora"" book but I really liked High Water.High Water is high-grade entertainment from beginning to the end. Another great story from Ms. Hightower!"
2,Depressing,"I bought this book thinking it was the next in the Sonora Blair series. The only reason I finished it is because I can't bring myself not to finish a book I've started.What was apparently supposed to be ""suspense"" came across as a very poor effort at writing literary fiction. The book had a very depressing tone to it, and I read it more to get through it and be done with it than because I was enjoying it.Stick with the Sonora Blair series -- this one really isn't entertainment and takes a whole lot of effort just to read."
5,Very strong and heavy,I would recommend this product to anyone who needs to crush pills or make a pultus.It's nice to have a bowl that doesn't move all over the place while you're trying to crush.
2,It broke in use!,"Had this for several years, and it worked fairly well, though not great. I think I prefer the standard shape of pestle. However, while I was using it to get cardamom pods open, the mortar cracked in half! I would not recommend this item."
5,FOX RUN Marble Mortar n Pestle,">UPDATE:4 MONTHS LATER~GOOD PRODUCT;used daily, does the job, pulverizes with ease. I LOVE using this mortar n pestle. I have small Pretty Bird Pellets that I need to grind to a powder for one of my nectar eaters. I have tried various methods to get the results that I get with the FOX RUN. A couple twists and voila, job is done! This product is made so well that I believe it will be one of those items you pass down for generations. Made well, don't drop it and you will have it forever."
2,Broken in the box,Well I was really excited about this mortar. The second I picked up the box I knew that something was broken. I mean broken into so many pieces and fine marble powder. The bowl part was broken but the handle was not. I have sent the package back for return. I am apprehensive to order another- for fear that will arrive broken as well?
2,Not good for garlic,"I have been looking for a set of mortar and pestle primarily for crushing garlic. This set looks like one that would fit my needs because the pestle has a mushroom shape that can prevent garlic cloves from flying out of the mortar when being hit. However, the fit between the mortar and the pestle is too close to have sufficient force to crush garlic. The set may be good for mixing herbs but does not work for crushing garlic. The seller should have given a better description."
2,For one I already wrote a review on this one!,I am not understanding why I am being asked to write a review on thiswhen I already did write a review! Please look it up!
1,How So ?,"I recieved this and it does not come w the top that is also supposed to be the pestle ? I wrote this before , but got no response? So I just found somone who had a pestle and no mortar ?"
4,No cap?,"The product itself is wonderful. However, when it was shipped to me, there was no cap on it. It was sealed with the foil/paper but no black plastic cap!"
5,The Good Oil,I have been using this oil for two years and refuse to run out of it. I like the overall well being that I feel when using it daily. It does wonders for your hair and skik. It is always packaged well for shipping. I highly recommend this oil.
3,hemp oil review,"This is a gret product,due to the quality and value. I apply this oil to my hair as a leave in, also use it on my face and body. It makes my hair stronger and extremly smooth,it's lightweight and not greasy at all.I am african american and I can use this oil on my face with no problem of break outs. My skin is smooth and silky.For nutrition I make salad dressings,smoothies,or take a 1TB of the oil. You can get recipes on YouTube or health blogs ...The only problem with this product is the packaging.They ship the oil in a small box so It's laying sideways and only 1inflated bubble wrap . Not enough protection ! That is why I didn't give it a higher rating."
5,Good quality oil.,"Would recommend. Keep in mind that it is a darker oil and more flavorful. Great for salads and meats, not sure about baking with it."
1,Defective Bottle Cap,"I expect that the oil is healthy but the bottle cap is defective. It was impossible to seal the bottle (after opening it) with its ridiculously flimsy, broken, plastic cap."
3,"Buy For Health, Not For Taste","If you are buying hemp oil, consider it for the health benefits and not the taste. Nutiva's Hemp Oil is descried as having a ""nutty"" taste. It does not taste nutty, but rather ""earthy.""Its about a 5/10 taste wise; not terrible, not great. I've tried using it as a replacement for olive oil, but the taste of the oil comes through too strongly.This product may be a good use to throw in for shakes or smoothies for its health benefits, but I do not consider this a viable replacement for traditional oils.EDIT: I've found mixing in hemp oil in shakes or making salad dressings is quite tasty."
5,Love it!,"The bottle is much bigger than I expected and it doesn't taste as bad as some of the reviews implied. It taste fine. It feels great to be getting all these great Omega 3's, which I know my body loves. I've been using it topically for my skin during these dry winter months and taking a teaspoon daily. I just got it, but so far so good."
4,Worth it!,"I bought this Hemp Oil out of curiosity, and after it came in I'm glad that I did. I wouldn't recommend consuming this product by itself as it has the consistency and texture of cooking/canola oil. But the health benefits from this product are incredible! I saw several other reviews that mentioned it had a nutty aftertaste, which I found to be accurate. Great purchase."
4,Green Oil is good for you,I Love this product I use it to dip bread into & add it to recipes that call for regular oils . My family & I love it we order the one 16 oz bottle every three months
5,Use a BASTING BRUSH to butter toast,Tastes good and good for me. I pour a 1/4 cup in a glass and keep by the toaster oven with a basting brush to butter up my toast. Will use it up before it can putrefy and be at the ready.
5,SO Extremely Delicious and Powerful!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Thank You Nutiva!!!!!!!!!!! I Adore this product. Hemp seed oil is comprised of the same fatty tissues which the human brain is mainly comprised of, has enough healthy fats to keep a little bit of plump on me (i have a high metabolism and its always been difficult for me to not look too skinny. This Hemp Seed Oil product helps me to feel better about my body image and it also helps my brain, neurons and all of my cartilage(joints) and body function better!! i crave this stuff!!!!"
5,Toxin Free ---- and no Drug Test Fails,"I switched from fish oils to HEMP oil to get away from mercury and other toxins in fish oil. There are fish oils that are processed to removes mercury et al but the process also removes beneficial elements. Flax is a good natural product, but is implicated in some prostate issues - so I mitigated my risk and switched to pure, organic HEMP seed oil.HEMP Oil gave an almost immediate benefit in the way I feel. I use it in my morning protein drink (which also contains HEMP seed powder).For those worrying about failing a drug test - do not. I just passed an employment screening test (very stringent). You will not fail with HEMP seed products - no THC or CBD's. Just pure health."
2,Sent within the dates but...,"I just opened my Hempseed Oil (end of January 2013) - it's medium to dark green/brown and murky not the light green it is suppose to be. It was also packaged back on September 13, 2012. It has a Best Before Sept 13, 12013. So it was sent within the dates but the product did not seem fresh. Oils like these do darken after opening from exposure to air but I feel that this was too dark for a freshly opened bottle. I did complained to the seller (PureFormulas) and they sent a new bottle with return label so that I could exchange it but it was the same date and actually tasted worse. I will be buying from my local vitamin store it's about the same price and I can check the dates."
2,"Love this product, not happy with my purchase from this seller","We use Hemp oil all the time, we love it. We have always purchased through Amazon but the seller was Nutiva. This time it came from a different seller. I received my products on time, however, all 3 of the packs that I ordered had Best if Used by Dates that had already past. I tried to find a way to contact the seller through Amazon to see if they would send me packs that hadn't expired, and there is no way to do so with food products apparently, so the only course of action this leaves me is to leave a negative review. Buyer beware!"
4,Saw Dr OZ put in smoothie on show,havent tried but if dr oz had on his show...im trying..lol damn got 9 more words to write...u get the gist
5,Great,"Have not decided how to use this product yet, except take it by the spoonfull. Very tasty and will make a part of my daily diet!"
1,Rancid!!!,This hemp oil was rancid. The oder was very strong. I can not use. I will not order any oil product again.
5,Get it for everything,"Great for frying, sauteing, salads, pestos, etc. I keep mine in the refrigerator. Great taste, super good for you. You won't be disappointed."
5,Better than flaxseed oil,"When I purchased this for the first time I did not quite know what to do with it, so it took up space in my fridge for about six months until I had a liver/gallbladder issue. As I researched how to manage my health issue, various diets recommended using flaxseed oil exclusively. As I continued to research, I discovered that for all the good qualities of flaxseed oil for liver health that hemp oil beat it out in all categories. It's just not as well known. This is a fragile oil. Keep it refrigerated and do not cook with it for best health benefits. I put it on my food right before eating. The oil is green and has a nutty taste to it which I have learned to enjoy. Since I don't use any dairy, this is my topping for veggies, sweet potato, potato, gluten-free pasta, or to dress a salad. I am buying it in the large 128 ounce bottle to refill the 24 ounce bottle as it is much cheaper that way. Just remember both must be stored in the fridge."
4,healthy but dreadfull,"Its good for your health for sure, but the taste is not delicious as advertised lol it tastes kind of bad...if you are planning on doing salad dressing with it its ok, but this you can't use it plain....unless you dont mind the taste lol"
1,tastes like grass,I purchased this for the health benefits. Unfortunately I couldn't get past the taste. The oily grassy taste was too much. It ruined the flavor of anything I put it in.
3,...,I do not like the taste and have been trying to see what things I can do with this other than dressing.
1,I WANT MORE,"Why can't someone write an IN DEPTH BOOK on SAP BASIS? I feel like the real inside information is not being shared by these so called ""experts"". We've all taken BASIS 101 - now give us more! I'm still waiting for a book that gives MORE."
2,Ho-Hum,"Same old topics from other SAP books and documentation covered again in light fashion. Touches on most Basis topics but does not go in-depth on any of them. The Oracle portion was verbose but extremely weak in detail, not to mention it was seriously outdated and straight from old SAP documents that are no longer used.If you've taken the SAP courses or have access to the SAP online doc, you don't need this book"
3,Average,"This books provides overview to the routine Basis Adminstration. Personally, I think it is useful for Basis Administrators but not so for Basis Consultants. The book lacks width and depth."
4,Good book,The book is good. It's based mainly on UNIX and Oracle. You can only use a quarter of the book if you are using NT/SQL.
3,Okay as Reference.,Most of the book is okay. The chapter on Correction and Transport is a big mess. It doesn't tell you how to use the TMS in detail. Try creating transport routes using the book. The documentation in SAP is much more clear.
2,Ohhhh what could have been,"I was disappointed in this newest book by Michael Slade but admit I finished it anyway. Mephisto was a good character and the story line was fine but the overwhelming amount of history mixed with too little substance left me wanting a re-read of headhunter or any of the other truly fun Slade novels. I kept at it, waiting for it to get up to speed but.....and the ending left me feeling I had wasted time which is a true reading fans worst nightmare. Check out other Slade novels first then read Burnt Bones if you must."
1,BORING!,I became so tired of slogging thru pages and words to get to the story that I abandoned the whole ordeal 1/3 of the way thru.
1,too much of everything..,"I quickly tired of all the ancient history lessons, the constant referrals to earlier books by Mr. Slade. The main plot is buried under and between all the talk about Druids and Romans and Scottish wars, hoards, kilts etc. Mephisto, his evil hero, is almost unbelieveable and why he has to be so cruel in order to find his ""hoard"" gets lost somewhere. Lots of blood in this book...if you like rape, torture, sadism, masochism set in the beautiful San Juan Islands...then this is the book for you. I didn't finish the book...when body parts started being cut off, I called a halt. But I had been skimming and skipping sections for quite awhile. Not too difficult to put the book aside."
4,Edge of your seat,"Graphic, sometimes gory, always suspense filled. This is the first of Michael Slades books I have read. It will not be the last. Mephisto is truly demented. The historic research and attention to detail involved in this story is exceptional. From gladiators to druid priests to Canadian Mounties. Slade ties it all together seamlessly."
2,Too Much Information and told without Pizazz,This is the first book I've read by this author and the last. While the premise could have been interesting -- tying back ancient history to a madman's quest for knowledge -- this author writes information about history dryer than most history text books that I had to read in college.Another annoying thing this author does is repeat sections of the book verbatim from chapter to chapter -- bad editing job or how the author really writes?I'm giving the book two stars because I think it had the potential to been something really neat had he let the story come out instead of burying it in with so many facts of history. He could also do a lot with character development if he gave it the same passion as he does with his history research.
1,Way too much,"When Stephen King writes, he draws you into the character's fear and really makes you dread what's coming next. From Slade - nothing. Horrifying gore - but no emotional link to the characters. What is that? Gratuitous horror? Whatever. When I love a book, I read every sentence and don't skip ahead (don't want to ruin the plot for myself). Jumped all around the pages of ""Burnt Bones"". I will say one thing for Slade - his research is thorough and his coverage of ancient history very interesting. It was also fun to see my hometown (Saskatoon) brought into the story."
1,Sorely Disappointment,"I've enjoyed Michael Slade's other books, but I was sorely disappointed with Burnt Bones. He's always provided historical background in his other books but, this time, he went overboard. There was so much historical background that the murder mystery part of his book slunk into the background. I found myself skipping sections just to get back to what was happening in the present. I felt the mystery itself was an afterthought he threw in between the history lessons. And, the only character he really developed was the villain. His other characters weren't fleshed out enough to drum up much sympathy and I really missed following the case with Le Clerq. Much, much too wordy."
4,Special X is back!,"Robert DeClercq and Special X is back with a new thriller. Although weaker than previous entries, it keeps the reader on its toes with great action and shocking twists. If you have a taste for psychological horror and suspense, Michael Slade delivers!"
5,History Made Fun,"This entry into the Special X universe is without a doubt my favorite, a book that features not only the introduction of a great villain, but a fun story that is hard to put down.Memorable characters and page-turning suspense are just the tip of the iceberg with Burnt Bones; in true Michael Slade fashion, history weaves with modern day psychos to tell a creepy tale of obsession and desire - and provide the reader with an exciting rollercoaster of a conclusion at the same time.While not the most forensics-oriented book of the series (remember that Michael Slade and his band of fictional Canadian Mounties were doing the crime scene thing long before CSI or its television clones came along), it is certainly the most fun.So grab a cup of tea and a comfortable chair, and enjoy the fun of Burnt Bones."
5,the best,I love my new cast iron pans. They are exactly as described and work great. They are a great quality item.
3,Too Small,"I use it, but it is a lot smaller than it looked in the picture. It gets the job done, but I wish it had been larger."
5,"Great, but you might think it's a little small","Length:: 3:31 MinsWe just love Lodge cast iron and wanted to get a muffin pan. I was actually expecting this pan to be bigger. It's kind of like a compact size, but makes the best mini-muffins ever. Also because it is cast iron, expect heavy.Other than the size, we really do love this pan. Be sure to put oil in it and then heat it right before use and then the muffins will come right out when cooked!"
5,Same volume as current muffin pans,So based on earlier reviews I was worried about size. The pans came today and I did a water test. Filled my current muffin tins that I have had for about 10 years with water and poured it into the Lodge ones. While the Lodge look smaller it was exactly the same volume.
2,Too Small For Most Uses,"This product is of high quality, as is anything cast iron from Lodge. However, if you plan to make muffins in this muffin pan, think again. They are just too small for anything other than small corn muffins. Each muffin well is so close to the next that they don't allow for any thing to expand on top. The muffin well is tiny to boot. About the size of a small apple."
2,""" EXTREMELY TOO SMALL ""","I was shocked when I received my pans. They are like cute little toys for my daughter to play with. I love that its Lodge and I will make bite-sized muffins to get something out of my investment. But note, as far as value, had I seen these prior to purchasing them, I would say they are worth about $5.00 each and no more than that. I am not kidding!"
4,Great with camp oven,Works great with a camp oven. The size of the individual cup cakes is definitely on the smaller side but still worth it for the even cooking in the oven
2,bait and switch,product advertised was 5p3 and I was sent a 5p2. Tapered sides. pretty small. To hard to return so I will make tiny muffins and stay skinny. Too bad.
3,usefulness of the cornbread pan,"This pan is too small for the recipes most families will be using. The main solution is to have two or three. Another solution is for the manufacturer to cast a larger one as long as there are handles at each end and not so heavy that muscle men are required.My preference in muffin/cornbread pans is twelve holes, but with enough weight to bake evenly and use a baking stone on the oven shelf."
1,Terrible muffin pans!,"I bought two of these and they are HORRIBLE!! I greased them well because a previous reviewer stated that they required extra seasoning. Not ONE muffin out of an entire batch came out without sticking horribly. They are so much smaller than standard size that I can't use cupcake papers in these pans. I have a lot of Lodge cast iron, so I am surprised and disappointed with the lack of quality here."
1,This is a MINI muffin pan,"I just received this ""muffin pan"" in the mail and was astonished by how small it was. This is a mini muffin pan at best. Teeny tiny little thing that will make bite sized muffins. Not what I expected or would have ever purchased had I known. It's going back."
2,Disappointed,"Just by looking at the picture, one would assume the product is of a standard size, but it's really small. When I opened the box and pulled out the muffin pan, I saw it as a child size product. I am greatly disappointed! I left the pan soaking in water over night and I notice rust after doing this a couple of time, yes I should have used a non stick application but I didn't and I was really surprise that the product didn't have a longer lasting life, most people do not prefer cooking with cookware that has rust on its surface."
2,Straight side muffin pan,I sprayed the pan with a non-fat aerosole spray before filling and muffins (corn) still stuck. I am not happy with the pan. The holes are small and the bread difficult to remove.
3,too small and sticky,"This Lodge Logic, Seasoned Cast Iron Cookware Muffin/Cornbread Pan has numerous problems. First of all, it's too small. Only six slots for the muffins is bad enough, but the muffins themselves are too small. Second problem is that the cornbread and muffins tend to get stuck in the holes. Not the entire muffin or cornbread but the very bottom of them. When you take them out of the pan, expect a good 20% of the muffin to break off and remain stuck. Cleaning is sort of difficult as a result of the small areas. Overall, not the best pan in the world but if you see one for cheap I suppose it's good enough."
2,Too small,"I disagree with those who say this is a regular sized muffin pan. Thinking it was an optical illusion, I took one of my regular sized pans and filled the cup 2/3 full with water (normally the amount you would fill a cup with batter). I then poured the water into the cast iron pan and it filled to the rim. So if you are using a mix that makes 6 muffins, you would probably have batter left over and smaller muffins. I returned this pan and am ordering the Camp Chef model, which is larger (and cheaper)."
1,muffin pan caste iron,"this was too small, the picture is deceptive.This is not adequate for corn bread or cupcakes.this item should say mini muffin pan. very disapointed. wasted my money."
4,Not what expected,I assumed the reviewer that said it was normal sized just shaped different due to the straight sides knew what they were talking about. The sides are not straight up and down but slanted like a regular muffin pan and the size is smaller than regular muffin pans. Will make mini muffins not full sized.
4,Very small.... each cup hold 1/4 cup batter,I wanted an old fashioned cast iron muffin pan like I used to have many years ago. These are just very small... each of the cups hold about 1/4 cup liquid. I'm sure that I'll get lovely very small muffins with them and so will keep them. But my only choice for an older style seems to be ebay. I looked at the Lodge website and they just do not make anything as large as standard muffins.
3,These only hold 1/4 cup!,"I bought one of these after reading the reviews saying they were NOT smaller than standard pans but they are. I measured. They hold 1/4 cup where the standard pans hold 1/2 cup each. They are not ""mini-muffins"" but they are pretty close. It's a cute pan, so I'll keep it as I'm sure I'll use it eventually and I love Lodge Cast Iron but they are NOT standard size."
5,great muffin pan,"These do take some getting used to, and they need some extra seasoning so they wont stick. They are great though."
4,"Muffin wells are sloped, not straight sided","I bought two of these to make Yorkshire puddings and popovers and specifically wanted a straight-sided muffin pan. These will probably still work, but are not as advertised."
3,nice quality but small,this is not a standard muffin tin at all which is what I was expecting. I think it might work better for poached eggs or maybe small muffins so long as they don't come out much over the top. The spaces are really tight together.
4,Cerama Bryte Ceramic Cooktop Cleaner 28 Oz,"Product is great, sample came with our new stove and i liked it. I tried a similar brand, but it left a greasy film that I couldn't get off. This is much better. Price was good when I ordered a couple months ago, but now it has gone up almost $2.00 a bottle for no valid reason. Won't buy online again unless the price is equivalent to what I can buy if for at the store."
3,top broken,"When I opened the box it came in, it was loose in a large box where my clothes rack was placed. There was no packing around the bottle of cleaner. Then I noticed the lid was broken where it connects to the bottle. I can still close it, but it is not as secure as if the lid was attached to the bottle. I am sure that it rattling around in such a large box caused the top to break.The cleaner was not new to me, but due to an injury, I could not walk into the only store in town that carries the cleaner, so thought it would be a help to order and have delivered to my door. But the fact it was not packed correctly so as to prevent damage to the fragile plastic top, probably won't order again."
5,"Works, plain and simple.","After dealing with a dirty black stovetop for too long, I bought this stuff and it WORKS. Not much to it, put a dime of it on, maybe mix a little water for distribution, scrub a little and wipe off. Never better, never easier. Also I couldn't find it cheaper anywhere local and certainly not any more convenient than ordering from Amazon and having it delivered to me instead of searching for it for days."
3,Barkeeper's Friend is just as good,Bar Keepers Friend works just as good as this stuff and it's much cheaper.
5,3 Years of Burnt-On Food! Gone!,"Being a new homeowner, I had no idea the trouble a flat surface range would introduce to my everyday cooking. After several attempts to clean using glass cleaner, general purpose cleaner, special cleaner - EASY-OFF Cooktop Cleaner: 8.1 OZ, and even using a razorblade, I was still left with left over residue and I thought I was doomed to buy a new stove!Fast forward from three years ago to present day, I bought this on a whim at a big box home store. The product has decent instructions, but I dabbed a few drops all over the problem spots of the stove above the rim of the heating elements and proceeded to wipe out the years of burned food and split messes. It did take some heavy duty scrubbing with a few paper towels, but the result is a new looking surface!Buy this product, it'll save your stove!"
3,"The best I've found, but not perfect","Cerama Bryte Ceramic Cooktop Cleaner works pretty well. It removes mild grease and spills. But it doesn't work as well as advertised for really baked-in spills on a modern cooktop. So far, I haven't found a product which does what this product advertises on truly hard-to-remove baked-in spills."
4,It isn't magic but it's close,"We just got our first ceramic-top range and got this stuff after finding a lot of recommendations. Out of curiosity, I tried 409 and some orange-based cleaners, but they didn't work very well at all. Mineral stains and lightly burned food/grease disappear under this stuff. It reminds me of liquid wax or polishing compound for cars. Even the carbonized stuff yields a little after you let it sit for a while. It doesn't completely remove the need for some effort and careful scraping of the heavy chunks, but for regular maintenance and finishing up after a full cleaning, this stuff can't be beat."
5,Cerama Bryte works the best for me,"This Cerama Bryte works the best for cleaning my glass stovetop. I've tried other brands, but this one cleans the best. I recommend using the pad that they offer. I already had the pad when I got a sample of this. The pad is not abrasive, but does remove stubborn spills. The pad is similar to a Scotch Brite pad, but I think the Scotch Brite is more abrasive and may scratch the glass."
5,Terrific Product,"This cleaner definitely outperforms any other cooktop cleaner I have used. Also get the microfiber cloth - using the cloth vs paper towels or even non scratching sponge scrubbers gets better results. Be sure to shake the solution before using it. And if you've got a stubborn mess, pour & spread around the solution, let it sit for awhile, then use the dry microfiber cloth to tackle it."
4,CeramaBryte Cleaner,"This item arrived very quickly from the vendor. I only had a small sample bottle I received when purchasing my new smooth-top stove, and needed to replenish. I found this price lower than all other internet vendors. So far, so good, regarding performance, although I have not yet had a major spill to clean up."
4,So far/So good,This was the recommended product to use for my range and it has worked well. Sometimes I have to use something stronger.
4,Cerama Bryte Cleaner,"I have used this cleaner for my ceramic stove top for a couple of years. The product does a great job keeping my burners free of burned-on grease or burned-on spills. It is best when used as a regular clean up for maintenance to keep the stove clean. The price was great too! Sears wanted an ""arm and a leg"" for a much reduced size container of the product. Amazon had the larger size and the bargain!"
4,Been using this product for 11 years,It keeps my stove top looking great. Easy to use. You just have to make sure you're diligent & use it often. I use it every time my stove top has anything boil over on it or I cook anything that spatters greasy stuff on it. That's usually about 3 times per week.
3,Ok,"The book itself is a great tool for learning piano for beginners. My only qualm is that it did not come in a good condition as it was listed. The back cover was hanging off of the spiral binding; this was not mentioned in the product description. Besides for that, the book is great and I think that it is worthwhile for beginners."
3,Could be better,I bought this book for my college piano class and while it did the trick I couldn't help but notice that it teaches some things out of order. If you have musical experience it isn't a big deal but if you're just starting out it can be confusing because it will teach you something one way and then explain it another way in the next unit.
2,Alfred's Group Piano for adults,"O.K., but the music is kind of boring. It's more work than pleasure. The Alfred's basic piano course Level 1 Adult All-in-One Course is better."
5,Good Beginner's book.,Piano book starts from basic level and quickly progresses to a more intermediate level. Great for students that played piano in the past but want to pick it back up again.
5,Alfred's Group Piano for Adults Student Book 1 (Second Edition),"This is an enjoyable, easy to understand book. Playing with a group was new to me, but it instills discipline in counting accurately, which is one of the main aspects of successfully playing an instrument. Doing homework straight from the book eliminates an enormous amount of paperwork, and is a great selling point for me. There is so much fun to be had when playing as a group, as well as when doing solo repetoires."
5,Beautiful and Brillant!!!,"Patrice is so talented...! This is definately 5 star material from a five star singer/songwriter...music you should hear, by all means! Give us more, Patrice!!!"
3,The Rock Fever Pressing Is A Bootleg,"All 3 Hard Stuff albums are great... this one, Bulletproof, and the newly discovered Entrance To Hell (listed as by Bullet). And the Angel Air pressings are the best ones to get, with excellent sound quality. Same can't be said for these Rock Fever pressings. They're bootlegs made from vinyl. Why bother? Get the real thing on Angel Air."
3,Not quite as good as I would have liked,"Not quite as good as I would have liked. Does not seam to hold as good as I thought it would. Not bad, just not as good."
3,Good information but outdated,"This book was probably great a couple of years ago. It has great step-by-step instructions, and it walks you through things in a very detailed manner.However, since the versions of all software (and the OS) used in the book have been updated at least a few times since 2004, I ran into several issues. Maybe 10% of all the links are accurate (which you need to install the .rpm files in the way the book tells you to), and when you do find the updated versions of everything, some of the commands the book gives you produce errors. Since the instructions probably worked correctly in 2004, there is no information on what those errors mean or how to fix them.In short, I'm setting this book aside to find something more recent, and reloading the system I was using to test this with. If you do not have prior experience and a good understanding of how all of these programs work and how to troubleshoot their errors, I would recommend finding a more up-to-date book."
4,Great book - got everything working (took a while),I've been working on getting my RedHat Fedora 3 working with LAMP. Finally I sat down and spent some dedicated time with this book and got it working.apache: apache_1.3.33mysql: 5.0.2-alphaphp-5.1.1This is my environment I setup and it worked! Good step by step instructions and the quick reference steps in the back of the book were excellent.Highly recommend.
3,Not exactly the most secure book.,"This book is more af a composite of the 4 taken straight off multiple online resources. The book reads as if you follow page by page, you will understand how to get them ""Working Together"". My strongest complaint is that it truely disregards security concerns in the earlier chapters. At many times you will feel alot of copy/paste has been performed. However, the book is surely for someone who has never touched any type of unix. if you fit this bill, then this book could work for you.Try ""Hacking Linux Exposed Second Edition"" with 1 or 2 online newbie Linux sites that cover basic system configuration (there is more than enough). This book covers enough to get them working together and with a eye on security at the same time."
2,"Outdated, not written for beginners that I can tell","If you know most of the stuff discussed as they assume in their writing, you wouldn't need this book. Hence, find a different book/author."
2,Spends why too many getting Linux running,"Way too much time spent on the L or LAMP. Which in many cases is getting an .iso, burning the .iso to a CD or DVD and installing it.It maybe there , but I haven't found it yet if you try to install LAMP Server on a Virtual Machine(oracle version for Ubuntu) and end up after the install with a blank black screen.In other words based on the title, it's a Dud. Don't buy it"
2,Mixed review of material covered,"If you are looking for a book that provides a brief overview, you will be satisfied with Eric Rosebrock's book. If you are looking for a ""how to"" reference book that covers MySQL and PHP in depth, you will probably be disappointed. The book merely provides basic information as the title states: ""Setting Up LAMP: Getting Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP Working Together"" that being LAMP installation and configuration procedures on a FEDORA Linux environment. This book offers the necessary information to install FEDORA Linux, and getting your Apache web server operating with MySQL and PHP. Rosebrock's book does save you the time and effort of having to glean information from those various ""open source computer geeks"" (right brain) web sites."
3,Not a beginner book,"This book is listed as a beginner to intermediate book, but I would rate it as intermediate at the very least. The author has a fetish for unnecessarily elaborate terminology that overcomplicates straightforward operational activities (to exemplify my point). Otherwise, it is a good overview of the four technologies and how they work together to provide a seamless web presence."
1,Volume Control? I think not,"I have a situation where I need to drive two sets of 4 speakers off one receiver and so I needed a separate volume control for one set. I got the VSS2 for this purpose, but once I installed it I could only reduce the volume in the zone covered by the VSS2 by about 20%, I could not take the zone gradually down to zero (not even close).I contacted Phoenix and was told that's how it is supposed to be, that the volume control was simply for fine tuning volume levels in the two zones. Huh???If you're buying this unit for volume control, be advised. It did not work for me."
5,Perfect.,"I bought this for my friend and she loves it! Unique frame style, modern color, perfect decor. I might just buy one for myself!"
2,not bad but,"This book is good for a quick overview of some valuation methods, but I found it to be a little too simplified, although it's not bad for mom-and-pop retail and service businesses. If you are actually don't going to do the calculations and want more professional results, take a look at ""Unlocking the Value of Your Business""."
3,Good Book....,Good book for general knowledge and some analysis. Needs more in-depth coverage in the area of micro businesses! One thing thoroughly frustrating was no reference to author's site for downloadable contents like templates and or example spreadsheets which would provide for modifications to suit. Would highly recommend inclusion of cd-rom.
2,A decent book but,"Provides a summary treatment of this subject, but a book I like better is ""Unlocking the Value of Your Business"", which seems to be more complete, but easy to use and understand."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I have an extensive collection of radios, small, medium, large, analog,and digital. This radio is without a doubt the worst of the lot. The reception is so poor,it barely qualifies as a radio. I gave it away, but probably should have thrown it away to save the new owner the trouble."
1,More absolutely Total Junk,"This is the second non-workable COBY radio I purchased from Amazon this month. The clock and the display do not function, at all.COBY radios are total junk and selling them is cheating consumers.I will not return either radio (too much trouble) as a lesson to myself.DO NOT BUY COBY>Shame on Amazon for selling this kind of cheating Junk."
2,You get what you pay for....,"This radio is obviously what you are supposed to get for the price. It works but has somewhat bad reception, it seeems like he just likes to work on some spots. Also, the case is opening in two pieces...."
1,avoid!,pros:its cheap (I paid $12).cons:it doesn't have digital tuning (there's a tuning knob on the side). no battery life indicator. cannot save presets. reception is poor.
1,"""POWER OFF"" SWITCH STOPPED WORKING 2ND DAY I HAD IT!","I purchased this and a couple of other pocket radios. This one was pretty nice and the sound quality was good. AM and FM tuning were very good to excellent. Shortwave was alright, missing some of the more used SW bands. The first night I listened to AM talk radio for a few hours then set the alarm to wake me up and turned it off. The alarm came on at the proper time, but when I tried to turn off the radio, the ""power off"" button would not work (another reviewer here had the same problem). I had to remove the batteries to turn it off. It worked fine the day before. It's a shame, I really liked the radio for the excellent AM reception. I decided not to exchange it for another after going online and finding that this is a common problem with this radio. I believe it is made by Kchibo in China. I returned it and purchased another Coby CX-CB12 radio which I give 5 stars."
1,Poor quality,"Purchased this radio and it worked only two days. I believe that this brand is of poor quality, so do not buy Coby brand items. On two occasions I had to discard products in this brand."
3,Caveat Emptier!,"If it says COBY, it's crap. Kind of.COBY is a substandard brand of electronics, manufactured in the P.R.C. In most cases, more trouble than its worth.However, if you REALLY need a certain electronic device, like YESTERDAY and don't have the case or credit, then COBY may be for you.Be prepared for below average performance. Returns and repairs. If your lucky you'll get one that you like and gives you no problems. If not, well...you've read the other reviews.So long story short. I will purchase several small emergency radios within the next several months. This COBY will be one of them. It will be the the low man on the totem pole. But hey, you never know.It's like anything else in life, ""You buys your ticket, and you takes your chance"".Good luck."
1,Coby CXCB91 - A really poor radio,"I'm sorry I wasted my money. This sad excuse for a multi-band radio has poor performance on all but the FM band. Tuning is very difficult because of slippage in the tuning mechanism - turn the tuning knob and nothing happens, turn it further and it whips right past the station you are attempting to get. Must stations of any strength appear at two places on the dial showing poor image rejection. Don't waste your money. I tossed mine into the trash can."
1,a pathetic sort of ''re-print',"i bought this disgraceful item, having seen parts of the original on-line and being interested and curious about the system of steering fenger's sailboat without a rudder. on arrival of the book, i was dismayed to find that what was desribed as a reprint contained no original photos or drawings at all so my main reason for purchase was denied. (fenger used an ingenious system for moving the centerboard fore and aft - worked well aparently...)however, i decided to read the text and was soon puzzled by strange stand-alone sentences that were totally out of context with surrounding text. these i eventually concluded, were the original legends that accompanied the missing photos - a case of adding insult to injury.all this and the shoddy and cramped way of starting new chapters anywhere on the page after the last one convinced me to never ever buy from the company again. reprints schmeeprints!"
5,Internal Beauty,"I read this book & became instantly inspired; I began searching for ways to help my community and 'fight' verbally for my rights. It is a very beautiful, romantic book as well as empowering. The book consists of letters that show when two people are truly commited to eachother and a cause (or more than one cause), they never trully fall away from eachother. This book will pull your emotions up one minute and bring tears to your eyes the next. I ended up highlighting half the book b/c I wanted to remember it all; I have only reread a book once or twice, but I could reread this book a million times and still find insight in it. A must read!"
4,Not Bad at All,This CD covers some deep issues and really pushes the listener to think about their life in relation to God's will. I highly recommend the album to people who like hip-hop and gospel music
3,If you are interested in HUNA; keep looking.,"This volume is only 59 pages in length, and does not contain nearly enough information about what the kahunas believed and practised.For a HUNA reading list; please see me HUNA listmania list. Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
1,"Shaggy dog ""Horror Flick""","I really like Patrick Warburton's work and bought this because he was featured..ha! They put his name on case cover but he has a non speaking walk on in a crowded smoky nudie bar,,,The disc feature about the making was far more interesting than the flick itself,I felt less cheated about the purchase when I saw how sincere and disappointed the makers were about the acceptance of their product,,this movie has damn little plot and lots of nudity,,some incest and plenty of backwoods sinnin if thats yr bag go for it,,otherwise shy away from it. I see much similarity between those losers who think they can sing on American Idol and those directors/producers who think they have a movie/story to tell..oh well,,,I had to give one star as no star is not an option, Becky is a scantily clothed adult who thinks she is a dog,,leading to my shaggy dog (a story without any real point) header choice."
5,nom nom nom nom nom nom nom,"Havent had Kurpuk in forever. I lived in Indonesia as a child and we had this all the time w/ Satay.This particular product is excellent and very easy to prepare. Simply fill a wok w/ vegetable oil bring it the oil up to 300F or so (don't let it smoke). My wok is big enough for 2 or 3 at a time. they cook really fast. Once it expands out (about 4"" in diameter) flip it over and give it a few more seconds. They'll get sort of a dull brown - pull them. I'm used to them being either bright pink or yellow. oh well.Oh - the instructions on the back make for entertaining reading.No go make peanut sauce."
4,Pretty tasty,These are just like the bagged ones but warm and cooked up fresh. My only quam is that on a few of the chips the edges stay hard and that these aren't multi-colored. Other than that I give it a B++
2,Not so great but alright for a one time thing.,"I'm going to be honest here. These aren't anything fantastic and are overpriced as far as I'm concerned.I couldn't wait to get them but when I did cooking them was the best part.They're very hard to cook perfectly, if you leave them in for a 5 seconds too long they become hard and chewy to the point they're inedible.The taste is just ""okay"" but after two or three chips they lose their charm and you find yourself not wanting anymore.Beware cooking any amount of these will stink up the entire house. We couldn't get the smell out for 3 whole days and the smell is not pleasant. It's a lot like burnt rubber.If you're just looking for a fun party snack with an asian theme than go ahead and get them but don't be surprised when people complain about the smell or ask what they're supposed to taste like as they definitely don't taste like shrimp and at $8 a bag they are not cheap."
1,Very dissatisfied,"This book was over 20 years old and very yellowed. They did nothing about my complaint or return, so Amazon had to refund my purchase price."
4,I like it,Putting the sermons on a CD will make things easier. It is hard to find older gospel sermons. The sermon is a good sermon for those who like the older teachings. It also arrived in a timely manner.
2,Not For Adults,"This is a good book if you are 13 and under. There is not enough information in it for an adult. If a child wants to learn about five things about church, then this is the book for them."
2,Fluff,"Music: 5/10 Vocals: 1/5 Lyrics: 3/5 Production: 4/5Total: 13/25: C-I have a friend named Earl. I downloaded Earlimart. Earlimart is much cheesier than Earl.There's nothing wrong with this album. There's just nothing right about it either. It is very generic pop rock music. It comes close on a few occasions to be good but never gets there. The singer kind of breathily rasps his vocals. At least the production is pretty good.Basically, don't download Earlimart. There is nothing here to like or dislike making me wonder why they tried at all."
1,Perplexing,"I have to say this out loud: Since when was graverobbing ok, much less cool?Another question: if Elliot Smith were still alive, would this band have the gall to put this bad facsimile out and stake their reputations on it?The guy's not even around to call this what it is and that in itself is a travesty. The fact that people are hyping this record makes it all worse - so I feel compelled to say what might just be said if the poor guy were still alive: Treble & Tremble is the LEAST ORIGINAL record I've heard in a while.Here's an idea: go back to the drawing board, write some tunes that don't rob someone else's spark straight from the grave and earn your fans for a change.Or, just stick to ripping off a brilliant dead guy and bask in the moonlit glow of his tombstone.This record sucks."
3,First for me from Earlimart,"First off, I know nothing about this band or the guy who died who has been mentioned in other reviews, so I can't compare this cd to their past works. This cd was being played in my local Barnes & Noble one day and piqued my interest so much I decided to buy it.I am a collector of 80's cd's of tecno/goth/new wave etc... and this cd had alot of that sound. Musically it has the sound of Love & Rockets. The vocals sound alot like The Jesus & Mary Chain. I am always looking for new stuff with an 80's sound to it and this cd didn't disappoint me in that aspect.The major problem that I have had with it was that many of the songs sound the same. Out of the first 5 or so tracks I have a hard time telling one from the next. Maybe that is just a matter of giving this cd more plays.If you enjoy haunting vocals with a distortion sound of quitars you may want to check out this cd from Earlimart."
1,Not very good as a tutorial,"The text is very basic. In fact Sybase On-Line Books for IM8.0 is better than what I paid ... for.I have read introduction books on other subjects that are a lot more complete. If you intend to use this text as a reference, forget it because it would be impossible.The author makes reference to procedure steps, which do not exist.The book is very poorly printed (a whole bunch of black and white Xerox copies). In addition, it is spiral bound in a small spiral and is hard to turn the pages.If you want a reference on InfoMaker 8.0, don't buy this text.If you want a tutorial then use [something else]Believe me, this is first and last text that I will purchase by Mr. Bob Hendry."
5,Superb!,New weapon for the boys! And the perfect time to try them out. Going against the druglords of Columbia. This is action packed and well written as all of Mr. Douglass' books usually are. Fans of action novels should like this one. His descriptions of both battle scenes and the weapons are great.
3,"Decent, But Not Spectacular","This mid-70s effort finds Pharoah Sanders drifting a bit. The first track (Harvest Time) features a contemplative Sanders on Saxophone and the subtle guitar work of Tisziji Munoz. The second track (Love Will Find a Way) features Sanders with a bit more that old Sanders fire, but I could have done without the vocals. The final track is basically a keyboard dominated vamp that never quite gets anywhere. I usually end up playing the first track and skipping the remaining tunes. Worth picking up -- if you can find it -- for dedicated fans, but new listeners would be better off starting with his superior efforts of the 1960s/1970s, such as ""Thembi"", ""Karma"", or ""Summun, Bukmun, Umyun"", or the more recent ""Spirits""."
3,"Skip to ""Tauhid"" and save this for later","This CD, Pharoah's first, shows him saddled with mediocre backing musicians and still very much overshadowed by his influences. Only occasionally do you hear the full throated cosmic-chaotic roar or the floating Zen melodicism found in his later work. It isn't surprising that this release didn't generate much critical interest; there's frankly not much here to hold one's attention. It is pleasant and occasionally interesting, but not anything more than that. It's probably best that this is out of print; it is of marginal interest only to dedicated Sanders fans who want to hear what his sound was like in embryonic form. He showed great promise here, but it was only promise."
2,Preschool Computer Lab Teacher - OK for 3-5's,"I have taught preschool computer lab for two years and have used this software occasionally with my 3-5 year old students. For whatever reason, my students just don't seem to like this game. Students will play it if there is no other choice but are ready to move to another game as soon as the opportunity arrises.I like the software and the overall presentation, but something just doesn't click with my students, so I don't load this game often.NOTE: If successfully used this game on Windows XP and Windows 2000 Professional operating systems."
3,better software programs out there...,This game is frustrating for my just turned 3 year old. It isnt as mouse sensitive as the other software programs we bought like Reader Rabbit Toddler or Elmo Preschool which are much more easier to navigate through for a young 3 year old. I wouldnt recommend this until your little one understands how to click the left side of the mouse twice and when to click the right side. Stick to some of the other programs. No doubt though that this is fun for her when I help though.
4,Pretty Good Game,"My 2 1/2 year old likes this pretty well. I agree with previous reviewers about the party at the end. It was so bad that I assumed it would improve as you completed the exercises in level 2 and 3, etc. It didn't. In fact, once you get the party, you never get anything else for completing the higher levels. Not even the same party. My 2 1/2 year old mastered the mouse while playing this, and will sometimes play unattended for quite some time on her own. This game has some decent letter recognition, pattern matching, and motor skills activities."
3,Cool Album,"This CD is not bad to listen to but, this is the kind of CD that ""I have to be in the Mood"" to listen to. I like the Perrando Mix, The Balioteo Song, just to name a few."
3,This book covers Pool Checkers,"It is odd that no one else has noted this. But this book is specific to pool checkers, even though he calls the game American Checkers throughout and has separate books with the name Pool Checkers in the title. Key differences between regular, ACF checkers and Pool checkers: (1) regular pieces can capture both backwards and forwards in pool checkers, but only forward in regular checkers; and (2) kings in pool checkers can move any number of squares along a diagonal; in regular checkers, kings can move only one square backwards and forwards.If you don't play pool checkers, this book is not for you."
3,Pretty good spag.,"Pretty decent spaghetti western. Ive seen over 250 and this is in the middle rating for story , acting etc. Good performance by Fajardo as the lead villain. Basically man comes back to town to right a conviction 10 years before, and finds town held hostage by the bad guys. If you can find it on dvd, its worth the purchase."
4,Hmm...,"This is an interesting storyline, so why is is making me yawn? The stories are cute, but this volume really seems to deviate from the whole plotlines that have been going on before. It's just a bunch of filler.In this volume the main story is Ranmaru discovering that he may have a son. Due to the propensity of his affairs, it's entirely possible that he may have a son (and I'd be surprised if he didn't). Of course Ranmaru is standoffish at first, but eventually it leads to Sunako taking charge of the boy, which leads to a tease of a Sunako/Ranmaru pairing (would never happen, but it's cute to play at it). The entire story is like a bowl of whipped cream. It's light, sweet, & fluffy... but only good in small doses. Unfortunately this is just the beginning of a whole string of filler episodes. It's a fun ride, but it doesn't mean that it won't get a little tedious.Would I recommend this? Sure. The storyline's weakened considerably, but it's still a decent series so far."
2,Disappointed,"Every few months, when a new book of the Wallflower series is available in English, I go to my bookstore and eagerly buy it up. I have read every single one of the English versions that are available and am a huge fan. But, I have to say, I was disappointed by Volume 7. The storyline didn't seem to follow from the previous book, some of the story lines didn't make sense at all, and worst of all, it was mildly boring! I gave it the benefit of the doubt and reread it, simply because I WANTED to love it just as I love all the others. But sadly, I do not. I definitely don't hate it, and I'm glad I have it and that I read it, but I'm still a little disappointed that the book isn't characteristic of Tomoko Hayakawa's typical work. I love her though!"
4,Buisness as usal,"This is Subway to Sally as i know them! Cool MEtal Sounds combined with nice German Lyrics and some Instruments from the Middleage I think the Best Song on this Album is ""Der Hoffnarr""If you Like this kind of Music, this CD is a Must Have!"
4,"One of the ""better"" texts I've read.","This I have to admit was one of the ""better"" texts I've read for college. The overall set up of the book (from a student standpoint) was easy to follow, and actually written in a way that kept me interested. So many times texts are so boring it's hard to want to pick them up to read...this wasn't the case.As with most texts, your supposed to come away learning ""something."" In this case, I was overall pretty happy that I came away learning more than I have in other courses...I'm going to say because of the book, not the professor."
3,Drink a lot of coffee while you read..,This may be one of the driest textbooks I have read so far in my Master's Program.
5,Great.,Escape the fate being one of my favorite artist it was a must for me to get. Product got here quick and am very satisfied with the purchase. I would recommend buying cds from here.
1,destroying the scene,"I'm so sick of stupid bands like this who are obviously only in a screamo band because it's 'cool'. The music is unoriginal, the lyrics are stupid, and they dress like every other hot topic, MySpace emo kid. Bands like these are the reason why I'm trying to get out of the scene."
5,Works great for those huge windshields,"I have an Odyssey minivan and the only way I can get all of the windshield clean is with this squeegee. If you own an RV, it is a must for removing those cross-country 'bug collections'.Since I am of short stature, this product is a great help. I would recommend it."
5,My Kid Liked It,My first grader had to do a report about the Iguanodon. We ordered this for a visual aid. She likes it and I am happy with the quality. It is a hard durable plastic replica that is strong enough to be handled roughly. I'm sure she will have her toy T-rex attack it and she will let the Iguanodon get away in the nick of time.
5,exactly what I wanted,"This is the best dinosaur figure I think I could have gotten, and for a great price. Totally worth it. Great educational information- will buy more from this manufacturer!"
5,What a great book!,I absolutely loved reading this book! It made everything about the Constitution come alive and increased my appreciation for our Founding Fathers. I'll probably read it again at some point.
5,Nothing yet matches this book!,"This book is honest, intriguing, well written history. Bowen does an excellent job of mixing patriotism with honest history. This book tells the story and lets the reader/student make decisions about how to regard the subject(s). There is no comparison to this book on the Miracle at Philadelphia!"
4,Miracle at Philadelphia: An Asset,"As a high school student, this book is easy to read and comprehend and introduces the Constitution very well. It defines clearly how the Constitution came about, what it meant, and how important a role compromise and sacrifice played in the matter. It describes the problems that were encountered, which helps to portray exactly how hard it was to get all of the delegates to accept the Constitution. It also gives background information of the delegates and their contribution to our country. After reading this book, an appreciation is developed for all the work that our forefathers put into the Constitution, and for the fact that it remains effective to this day. The Miracle at Philadelphia is definitely an asset to have in the classroom if one intends to fully understand the history of the Constitution and its benefits."
2,Great for history buffs - boring for high school students,"I was assigned this book for an AP US History class and the general opinion of the book was that is was absolutly overwritten and boring. However, histroy lovers will enjoy the book - but for high schoolers - the Covention will not seem any more interesting."
5,Great Album,I love this cd and the artist. Bonnie Tyler is a great voice that is just wonderful to listen to.
4,the inimitable bonnie tyler,"Not sure if this is the definitive ""greatest hits"" but it certainly includes most of them. ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"", ""Best"" (even better than Tina Turner's version), ""Holding Out for a Hero"", ""Lost in France"", and the BeeGee's ""To Love Somebody"" are all great songs, with great hooks and superb wordplay. The highlight for me, though, is ""It's a Heartache"" -- really shows off one of the greatest voices ever in rock and roll -- Tyler really delivers the pain and anquish and hopelessness of a jilted lover in a way few vocalists could. Sadly, I understand that Bonnie Tyler retired some years ago and has not recorded any music in years. Too bad, although that's probably a good reason to have this record."
2,Terrible sound on this disc!,"Song selection is great but the sound on many tracks is very disappointing. What source did they use? I've heard all these songs elsewhere and they sounded great! For example,the track ""It's A Heartache"". I have the same track on an old Rhino Records collection that I purchased years ago and it has the full fidelity sound. The version here, along with my other favorite tracks, (Holding out..., Faster than...,and Total Eclipse) sound lifeless. Shame on Columbia Records for manufacturing such inferior product. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it. This cd is going to my local Goodwill store"
1,Missing a lot,"This came knocked down in a box, missing two knobs and any coherent instructions. Lots of shims and washers that may go somewhere, but its not at all clear except from a basic knowledge of infeed/outfeed. The Rousseau plate has been reviewed elsewhere, its as hard to work with as noted with the snap in rings and the difficulty in mounting your router.Update: Credit where its due to Rousseau, Andy took my call, discussed the use of the shims and is sending out the missing knobs via USPS. Good customer service can make up for poor execution in shipping."
1,Wrong Maxine,I was looking for Maxine the cranking old lady. Didn't realize that there were two cartoons by the same name.
2,"confusion with ""Maxine"" titles!!!","Be careful what you buy here. Amazon will present anything of like material to you including 'Maxine's. this book is not the craby Maxine you see on calendars. is it any good. who cares, its a rip-off."
2,Mmmmm ....,"To many examples. I expected something more practical. Matters with sisters have to be aproached very tactfully when rivalry is at its highest peak. Sorry, I did not find the answer I was lloking for."
1,I really wanted to like this book,"I kept slogging on, up to the point where Paul wakes up in a bathtub full of ice, having had a kidney removed, a theft perhaps orchestrated by his father-in-law. Oh c'mon! Totally unbelievable! Threw it down in disgust.The descriptions of working cattle were nice, which makes it worthy of one star."
5,Montana Noir,Cadence is my favorite McGuane novel and I've read them all. His vivid portrayal of this Montana family has real parallels across the state. In a laugh out loud realism he paints the decline of the West in a eulogy to the rural way of life now afforded by only the affluent. On stage Tom has no peer. He's the Mark Twain of his generation and a national treasure.
2,Disappointing,"I found this book to be very diappointing. The plot was not interesting and the characters were dull. I feel like I must have read a different book than that described in the positive reviews below. In any event, the writing at times is quite good , so maybe I'll try one of McGuane's prior works. This one certainly does not live up to its billing or his reputation."
3,Disappointing Finish,I read this book while spending some time out west. It has been awhile since I had read anything by McGuane. I enjoyed the characters and his prose. The story was compelling but the ending was disappointing. I'm not sure why he headed in that particular direction.
2,"Not for me, thanks--","The poorly titled book is described as ""a brawling, barrel-chested novel full of irreverent humor and outrageous characters and situations."" Well, no. McGuane was once an interesting writer. No more. Now he's a brawling, barrel-chested novelist full of -- oh, nevermind. Find something interesting from his early work, or better, go back to James M. Cain's SERENADE, which has nothing in common with this effort but is infinitely more interesting and satisfying."
2,The Cadence of Confusion,"Having heard a review of this book on NPR I eagerly looked for it's arrival via post. Oh, the intrigue, conflict and ripe character development described on the radio...I could hardly wait. What I found was a disjointed story line about morally bankrupt individuals, save Evelyn, Bill & Stuart. What was McGuane trying to tell us? I am still trying to figure that one out."
4,Offbeat and Well Done,"The Cadence of Grass is an offbeat novel about a disfunctional Montana family. The patriarch, Sunny Jim Whitelaw, has just died, leaving a will requiring one of his daughters to reconcile with her estranged husband, a man with a storied and bizarre relationship with Jim, before the release of his main asset, a bottling plant, for public sale. The story follows the family--Jim's wife, two daughters and his friend and ranch foreman, Bill Champion--in the months after his death. All of these characters are a little offbeat, a little bizarre, and there are a number of surprises in their stories, and in Jim's as well. McGuane's writing style, as well, is a little offbeat, a little bizarre, but the novel is refreshing, a little different."
3,Formatting Problems,"I liked the book and enjoy McGuane in general. The prose is beautiful, very funny at times and also quite profound. But there's a problem with the Kindle edition. In the copy I received, paragraphs are not indented, and there is no white space between them. This might seem like a minor problem, but it's a fundamental formatting issue that really makes the book harder to read. I imagine that this is a trivial problem to fix--it's a flaw in the CSS. Maybe I somehow got a bad copy, but if not, the publisher should be ashamed to put the book out this way."
4,Nice deal but not a great book,This was the first time I had read a book by this author. I thought the story wandered too much and I didn't finish it. As for the deal The book arrived in good shape and on time.
3,Repeat information,"My disappointment with this book was that it simply re-prints information from Margot Anand's book ""The Art of Sexual Magic"". So if you already own that book, you should look for something else. Otherwise, the information in it is good. I had just hoped it was something new."
5,A well written book!,"I found this book highly educational and sensitive to learning the ways towards new orgasmic heights. Margot spends time talking about the myths, repressions, and strides that women as well as men deal with in their sexuality as well as their sexual drive. She covers some historical info on our being and why we may deal with our sexuality differently. I particularly liked how she blends the different cultures into this book. A good read and a helpful tool for any couple interested in expanding their level of intimacy!"
2,left me unsatisfied...,"i received this book from a friend who has been trying to help me on the road to orgasm through mastrubation, and although i found the cover of the book erotic, i didn't find it to be that helfpul. i found both the title and the description to be misleading...it's far too cheesy (and even offensive for indian people that people are supposed to be addressing each other as shiva and shakti, dieties) and i think it was full of some useless stuff like these addresses...i think it needs to be more of a manual and it really wasn't..."
1,Horrible!,When I bought my beautiful stove they gave me a small bottle of Cerama Bryte Stainless Steel Appliance Cleaner and it was amazing! I feel like this is honestly an imitation. When I cleaned my stove it did nothing but stain it! It looks horrible now! I feel this is a fake cleaner and not Cerama Bryte! I'd recommend you find a place where they actually sell the real product!
3,Betta Bowfront Cube,The main problem with this product is it is poorly manufactured and in my opinion over priced.The cube is a really nice size and your betta will have room to swim. They are compact but are big enough for your betta to be comfortable. The cube comes with a plant and gravel. I didn't like the plant but the gravel is coordinated with the color of the cube.The lid is a great feature of this product. The shape is nice because you have plenty of viewing room.If you buy this product make sure you have some silicone aquarium sealer .........more than likely you will need it. Very poorly manufactured.
5,Amazing Facts!,"This book provides a point of view from an outsider who has more interest in solving our case than our own people do. This book is a must read for all puertoricans and for the US taxpayer. It is not perfect, but it's an eye opener. Myself being a former statehood supporter that now favors independence, recommend this book to anyone interested in how the last colony in the world is still surviving."
5,To understand Puerto Rico you MUST read this book,Many people in the United States mainland do not understand the Puerto Rico quagmire and the implications of the colonial status of the island. But what is worse is the cost to the American taxpayer of corporate welfare and its cost in the self determination of Puerto Rico. Odisheldize and Laffer put hit the nail right in the head. Any responsible U.S. taxpayer need to read this book. And any self respecting Puerto Rican needs to read this book and understand what is our reality.
4,A fascinating and inspiring work from an unlikely source.,"Who would have thought that a Marxist sociologist at Harvard could write a profoundly moving account of the history of freedom? Patterson delivers a highly readable account of the ""three chords of freedom"" as they evolved in the ancient world, were crushed during the Roman empire, and were reborn and spread worldwide by history's first freedom-centered religion, Christianity. The book has just two small flaws: the author's frequent references to rusty Marxist notions of class struggle, and the sketchy and incomplete character of the final chapters and conclusion. Still, it is a marvelous read. I for once can hardly wait for volume 2, expected in 1999."
2,A Bourgeois' Attempt to Understand Freedom,"Mr. Patterson is a bourgeois who understands freedom from a typical husbandman's perspective. What he doesn't see is the perspective of nomads, gypsies, wandering artists, etc., i.e. the moving crowd. He did not look at them, and by this missed the chance to write about a commitment to freedom much deeper and older than the attempts of the people bound to their soil or community. Also, he neglects the Jewish heritage of Christianity and its fight for freedom. Obviously he has not read Michael Walzer's ""Exodus and Revolution"". If he had, he would have known that the first successful attempt to become free from slavery did not happen in Greece but in the desert between Egypt and Palestine. It was not Greek rhetoric about freedom but the Exodus story that gave spiritual power to the civil rights movement."
2,See Jeremy Silman's Inside Chess Review,"Jeremy Silman, author of ""How To Reassess Your Chess,"" and ""The Amateur's Mind"" wrote a comprehensive review which you can find at InsideChess.com. Summarizing: the Steinitz line 4...Qh4 is more dubious than ever particularly now because of Peter Well's book ""The Scotch Game"" which has newer, Grandmaster lines that either refute or weaken Black's optimistic assessments. Silman believes that this book could confuse weaker players with outdated analysis, although players interested in their own research will enjoy not having to ""reinvent the wheel"" and find out that a certain line has already been tested and found wanting."
4,"Reviewed by my husband, the person who actually wore this item...","POSITIVES: Colors were accurate to the photo - Easy to get on - Fit well - Dragon print was coolNEGATIVES: The head piece -I won't call it a helmet- was an ill-fitting, assemble-yourself, set of super-cheesy, thin plastic pieces (I built my own, very cool, samurai warrior helmet)Overall, it was fine...received a lot of compliments. However, my wife didn't like the lower portion of the costume. She said that rather than the ""long kulats"" that they were, the bottom would have looked better made of wide panels worn over black pants."
5,Toddler Heaven,"My 3 year old is pretty bright and even though she could sing the ABC song I could not get her to visually recognize the letters. This CD ROM has a ""popping ballons"" game that is magnificent for learning to recognize the letters. This disk has multiple games that I know facilitated my daughters ability to become an expert with shapes, numbers and letters. I absolutely recommend it for all parents with toddlers in the home."
2,"Nice game, but low tech will drive you crazy","This game is nice, kids like it.However, it uses 4.5 GIG of hard drive (no kidding) and when you shut it down, it doesn't reset your graphics back to the original settings. This forces you to reboot unless you want to look at windows drop-downs in ""black and white"" mode. Also, I could do without watching the 2 minutes of credits with no ability to click through at the end."
1,Very disappointed.,"The learning games are satisfactory but the product itself is very low tech. It forces your screen resolution down to 480x640 and only 256 colors. If the game hangs up (often) your monitor is left at low res. They did not disable the Windows key on the keyboard and anyone with a child knows this key is hit often. It hangs up the game.You are forced to run the program from the CD, no Hard Disk only install. If you have more than one Disney Interactive CD, you are left constantly changing CDs because we know how our kids love to change games in the middle.There are 2 minutes of credits at the end of the game that you cannot bypass when exiting the game.C'mon Disney. Your product is stuck in the early 90s. Get with the progam (pun intended)."
5,Thought-Provoking Reality Check,"In his Preface to ""Twilight in the Desert,"" author Matthew R. Simmons explains that his book tells ""a story about Saudi Arabia's oil that differs sharply from the official Saudi version.... that Saudi Arabian production is at or very near its peak sustainable volume....and is likely to go into decline in the very foreseeable future."" These statements, which the author bases on his three decades in the oil industry and countless interviews, should get the attention of EVERYONE -- inside and outside the oil industry. This is the wakeup call for all of us -- from government officials to economists to consumers. This well-written, thoroughly researched and highly accessible book raises important questions that all of us need to take seriously."
4,"Delivered as promised, but I couldn't finish","I was interested in learning about the impending Saudi oil collapse, and I certainly did. Unfortunately, this book droned on and on and on (in my opininon).I don't know what I expected, but if you're looking for a jaunty read about oil and Saudi Arabia: this isn't it. If you're going to write a paper about it: this might do.I hate not finishing a book, but I just couldn't go on... To the author's credit, he does advise people versed in oil to skip parts that would be redundant."
5,Very good read,"The first book I read on oil resource, it is full of technical detail which did take me a couple of reads to fully take in (it says something for a book though when immediately can start back at page one after finishing it!).For me the best part of the book was his ability to analyse past production information (pre-nationalised Saudi Aramco, e.g. American companies info), current technical difficulties from the large number of SPE papers, and current claims from Saudi Arabia itself as to future performance.For me it did really ring alarm bells when fields that had previously been tapped, gone through significant depletion with mounting problems today detailed in SPE papers, were then expected to sustain greater then previous 1970 peak production for a long period of years! Certainly thought provoking."
3,Saudi oil fields are maturing,"This book is very repetitive and too long, but it does contains a lot of useful information about oil fields and the complex business of getting the oil out. From the facts laid out in this book there is little doubt that Saudi oil fields are maturing with years of dependence on massive water injection and in recent years horizontal drilling to maintain high production rates. The production curves included in the book for eight large oil fields outside Saudi Arabia, including Prudhoe Bay Alaska, are sobering. Clearly there is some risk that in the not too distant future Saudi oil production will begin to decline."
2,I was not too impressed,I am an Oil professional - 30 years in drilling and production. This book is very timely - we are running out of oil - All the major oilfields are in decline. New (significant) oilfields are not being found. As this progresses it will be a very big change of life.The author repeats and repeats the same ideas with few facts. Saudi keeps it technical information private. I was disappointed with this book. :(
2,Twighlight in the Desert,The book gets some of the technical facts on the oil recovery process incorrect. I know becuase I am in that business. The book is very repetitive.
4,Advanced Peak Oil,Don't read this book if you are bored by long discussions of petrogeology. Do read this book if you want to learn more about Saudi oil production and the myth of infinite resources that so many economists believe. Saudi Arabia is the crown jewel of world oil reserves and it has been tarnishing for quite some time. Matthew Simmons is an excellent writer too.
5,Required Reading for everyone...Worldwide!,"This is a somewhat technical book authored by Matt Simmons, the prominent oil banker in Houston, Texas. Matt died suspiciously after moving to Maine. Many suspect that the oil/illuminati/banking crowd had him killed.This book is a wonderful treatise on just how much oil remains in the mid-east and under whose control. There are many books I have read on oil. This is the best work on how much oil remains under the deserts in the mid-east.I highly recommend it. We have seen the peak of oil production worldwide and now will realize the inevitable decline in production forever. Demand continues to grow as China and India want to live the lifestyles that oil provided for Europe and the USA."
4,Interesting and detailed!,Very interesting read on saudi arabian oil - if you are looking for specific details on oil fields and production techniques. I found it fascinating.
3,"Good documentation, bad context","This book is avaluable resource, for such documents as Appendix C, with its material from two overlooked Senate hearings in the 1970s. But when he tries to explain the context for his material, Simmons often gets all tangled up.For example, on p. 52, he writes, ""Faisal bitterly remembered the pledge that Franklin D. Roosevelt had made to his father, assuring Abdul Aziz that Saudi Arabia would always have a seat at the table when a resolution to the Palestinian problem was to be decided.""Yet we don't have any evidence that FDR didn't said that, so Faisal could simply have bitterly mis-remembered it! We do know that FDR said things like this, ""I will take no action in my capacity of chief of the executive branch of this government which might prove hostile to the Arab people."" But that's a personal pledge, ""I ... my..."" -- not binding upon Truman or anyone since."
1,"Lies, damn lies, and statistics.","Simmons is a delusional wacko. Next thing we'll hear is that there really are little green men from Mars. Only the most gullible would believe this nonsense.The world is awash in oil. The only thing that has changed is that all the cheap oil is gone. We may have to spend more to find it, extract it and refine it, but that's a normal progression. What about the oil sands? More reserves in Canada than all of OPEC combined. And then we have the oil shales, the heavy oil deposits in Ven, etc etc. And then we have vast reserves of coal and natural gas, all of which can be readily used as fuel.Use your brain. Ignore this blantant nonsense."
3,Really ugly mermaid ! Not the cute Frog !,"Pay very close attention to the fact that color and styles may vary. We also got a very ugly mermaid instead of the cute frog. I do not recommend, unless you don't mind getting the ugly mermaid."
2,Real Philosophy or Social choice?!?!,"Yes it's true. The book of Sen it`s too much focused on the ""theory of social choice"" and it never makes an analysis of freedom and rationality by a pure philosophical point of view, but always by the point of view of the ""social choice"".And it's also true that this kind of analysis is often related to the impossibility theorem of Arrow, as all the social choice theory could be reducted to that theoremI think the title of the book does not say the essence of it, People philosophically intrested in these two concepts should read something else..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!!,I bought this camera last year for my daughter. It was so horrible I had to buy her a different one. I gave it to my twelve year old niece (not good for her but something to start her out with) It broke within a couple of months. The pictures it took were not worth buying.
3,Corporate purchase,"The camera is good for standard photos. I bought 15+ cameras for company use. The cameras lasted on average 2 years. In 2005 our target was a camera for $100, minimum 3 MP, easy to use, and to upload photos on the computer.As with all cameras which require AA or AAA batteries buy rechargeable batteries and charger. Sony makes a great product at Amazon. I use them at the office and at home.Sony BCG-34HVE4 Quick Battery Charger with Car Kit and 4 AA Ni-MH Rechargeable Batteriescut and paste this into Amazon: Sony Quick Battery Charger with 4 AA"
1,"Horrible Camera, do not buy!!!","If you know whats good for you, do not buy this camera. When taking indoor pictures, the LCD is so dark that you can't even tell what your pointing the camera at. The pictures turn out exactly what you see on the LCD. Indoor pictures with flash on are so bright, you can barely make out the picture past all the white. An indoor picture without the flash turns out completely black. This camera is useless. I have a camera that is over 6 years old, and it is 10x better and easier to use. I wouldn't recommend this camera to my worst enemy. I'm just glad I only paid $30 for it. Although, its not even worth that much. I only managed to get a couple of not so great pics out of it, and now I'm ready to just toss it."
1,Can't open it,"LOL. Went to use it, couldn't open it. Two others tried also. Luckily I always carry a lighter and back up matches anyway. Got home, tried to open it with tools. Still couldn't open it. Finally used tin snips to cut/rip it open -- got my tinder quick and flint out and chucked it. Good thing it wasn't an emergency...I might still be out there...frozen solid with the container clutched in my cold dead hands...staring at the ""China"" stamp on the bottom..."
2,Not the same as when I was a kid,"I had a match box like this, a brass one, when I was a kid in my teen years about fifty years ago. I should have known by the price that this one would only be maybe a fifth of how well it is built compared to the one I had as a kid. You have to be really careful or the side straps will bend VERY easily. It will do the job of keeping matches dry but will not take any rough abuse like the ones built in ""the good old days"" would. I give it a two star rating since it will do what it is met to do if you are careful with it. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HAB2TG/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleKen"
1,Better than nothing.,"While I didn't exactly expect a top quality product, I was disappointed by the rough edges and shoddy workmanship of this product. I seriously doubt if I will ever order from this company again."
1,Very short!,I bought this to house storm matches and it is not long enough. It would cost more to ship it back then I paid for it in the first place. Consider yourself warned.
2,Cheep but works...kinda,"Its cheep and you get what you pay for. The power supply is fine, no problems for me. Its flimsy metal, and the CD drive bays are hard to close.Has a cool green lighting effect, though."
5,"Easy read, extremely helpful!","After giving up on breastfeeding with my first two children, I am even more determined to get it right with my third (when she comes). I thought I was informed before, but obviously that wasn't enough. I picked up this book hoping for ""a practical guide"" and to gain some confidence to replace my fears of failure. I feel like this book is exactly what I needed. The information is helpful and not over the top. Cox does not use guilt tactics or spend lots of time on the benefits of breastfeeding, that information is everywhere. Instead she focuses on helping the breastfeeding experience to be successful while acknowledging that it can be challenging. I really wish I had this information when I was pregnant with my first."
2,Filters not correct sizing,"Filters are very slightly too small for the toddy system, although they are the same as the ones that now come with the toddy system, which are also too small. The filters used to be much thicker and work well. These ones dislodge easily when coffee/ water is added, with the result that when you remove the cork you get an avalanche of coffee grounds/brewed coffee, which then has to be strained to be usable. I hope the makers of the toddy system will take note and realize they have a problem."
4,Work as expected,These are replacement filters for the glass toddy maker. They work as expected. Package comes with two filters that can be used multiple times. Worth the purchase.
3,Not much,Hard to review filters because that is what they are filters. I will purchase again when needed. Would like to see more in a package.
2,Turbo Math Facts,My twins wanted this software and we made them pay half. Turns out they got very bored with it quickly. I would not recommend this unless you get it at a very cheap price.
4,Que viva Chile!,"For anyone wanting to get a good primer on one of the most unique Chilean artists of the past 30 years, this is the album for you. Tito Fernandez hails from the south of Chile and half sings and half speaks while accompanied by a traditional folk guitar. His songs are about work, soccer, love, birth and poverty and all use the highly colloquial slang of the south of Chile. Needless to say, if you understand Spanish, the lyrics will be quite plainly beautiful. If you don't, it doesn't matter - the collection should still be a fun record to have as part of your Latin American folk collection."
5,Loving It,"I received my new brass flag pole bracket and I'm lov'in it. The new bracket replaces the original tin bracket that came with the flag pole. I am very impressed with the sturdiness of the bracket, and damn, it looks good."
1,Take note of size,"I was new to the flag pole business (I thought all flags of the size we have have the same diameter pole) and this holder, while sturdy and well made, did not fit our 1"" flagpole so was worthless to us."
5,Great Book,"Great Book, very inspirational! The stories are thoughtful andwell written. Make you think about your life and how the storiescan pertain to you personally. They are very personnal and reach out to each one of us! Great for the whole family. Christian based."
1,Do not buy this book.,"The title is misleading. What is CORBA 3.0? Certainly not the 3.0 spec. The book does not cover the POA at all. Isn.t that part of CORBA 2.2? I found many errors in the book. The discussions are vague. I have read and recommended other IDG books, but this one... no way!"
2,"Too many jargons, hard to read and understand",This book tries to cover too many areas with unnecessary amount of jargons that serves only to confuse the readers. I am forced to look for another book on this subject.
2,"Full of information yet boring, non-practical and unclear","The book is very confusing. While the OMG bozos have done their best to make the CORBA as confusing as possible, the author doesn't even try to make it a bit more clear. All examples are given ""as is"" with the API explained in a ""by the way"" manner. The examples are VisiBroker oriented, yet the author doesn't even try to cover other ORBs and to give any hints on portable CORBA programming. I found the information flow very hectic and boring to read and the figures quite confusing (looks like more effort was spend on all those borders and shades).Finally, some examples are not indented (sic!), making them look like the winners from the Obfuscated C Contest.Conclusion: if you are considering purchasing this book - don't. Instead got for something from more reputable publishing houses (Prentice Hall or AW maybe)."
1,Don't believe the 5-star ratings,Horrible. The 5-star ratings are from people who obviously have an interest in making this book look good. LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR A GOOD CORBA BOOK.
4,Solid Album,"Anyone who is a fan of Belle & Sebastian will love this band. This is Camera Obscura's first album, and they really put a lot of great songs on this record. Tracyanne Campbell, the lead singer on most of the band's songs, does a great job giving life to the lyrics. The music is pretty low-key, not many electric guitars and such, but it's a good album for a rainy day."
2,"Less restraint , more feeling","For the most part many of these songs demonstrate the colder, more distant aspects of pop songwriting, however warm the ""vibe"" would have us believe, with their autopilot musicality and predictable tunes. On the few songs that do feel more inspired then the generic majority, it is definitely possible to see future pop majesty this band is capable of achieving, albeit it in a watered down familiar way to anyone who has ever picked up an older Belle and Sebastian album, whose shadow will hopefully prove underwhelming on future releases."
1,Bialetti Bombs,"Total disappointment. This little coffe maker managed to spray coffee all over our stovetop - no matter how many times we tried to follow the vague instructions. Additionally - this maker is advertised as 4-cup, which is 32oz. - even considering a 6oz cup - we expected 24oz. You are only allowed to put in 3oz. - so this maker doesn't even come close to 1 cup..... that is if you manage to keep it from spraying coffee all over the stovetop. The manufacturer of this unit needs to reengineer this expresso maker. Shame on this vendor for applying a 20% restocking charge if you return the item used. We'll see what Amazon has to say about that."
4,Audacious,"James Morrow is a writer after my own heart. In City of Truth, he takes an audacious idea--what if everyone always told the truth?--and uses it to show that there's something much deeper. We learn that while truth is beautiful, it can also be incredibly ugly. And that, while lies are despicable, they also have a place. And while we learn these things, we also get to laugh at some great imagination, as what would advertising be like if it had to be truthful (I especially enjoyed the ""new"" Surgeon General's warning on a pack of Canceroulettes, not to mention Camp Ditch-the-Kids). Morrow's got a way with this; his Full Spectrum story, ""Daughter Earth,"" contained many of the same elements: a light, humorous tone encasing a serious, yet not dull, meaning."
3,"Good, but too short","This book is rather funny, kind of a humorous cross between 1984 and Fahrenheit 451. It is, however, not a novel. It is a novella. I am glad I checked it out of the library, because I could not justify spending money on what really is unoriginal and short. It has its place in a collection of short fiction or novellas, but not a stand-alone book. I need more volume and more originality for my money."
1,Sucky New-Age Tripe!,Don't waste your time trying to join the Cult of Morrow. There are plenty of deserving writers who need your support. This book...sucks!
4,Pigs can fly!,"The above falsity(Pigs can fly!) could not be said in the City of Truth. For it is a lie. And lies are irreproachable in the City of Truth. Imagine being a politician in a city that won't allow it's citizens to lie. Imagine telling a pretty looking young woman you just met that you'd like to make love to her before you even had the chance to ask her name. In a city that does not lie nothing is sacred.James Morrow is an excellent storyteller to be sure. His novel is funny, touching, and often absurd. The first half was better than the second half, but overall I'd recommend this delightful little book. Give Morrow's book ""Only Begotten Daughter"" a shot too, it's quite good. He's funny, his characters are interesting, but more importantly he spins one heck of a good yarn."
5,Ha=Yes???,"In some Indian languages ""Ha"" means ""Yes"", and this CD lives up to it's title. YES! buy it, you will not regret this new offering from a very talented young man from the UK.The style is different from ""Ok"" - but the beats are ""fat""."
2,Big Disapointment,"Weak effort and nothing original. Sorry Talvin, but I was seriously disapointed. Perhaps Karsh Kale's debut album will pick up the slack."
3,"Okay, but not OK","Talvin Singh's latest is more of a groove-based outing. Whereas the British Mercury prize winning ""OK"" album had a myriad of moods and tempos, ""Ha"" is more firmly ensconced in the territory carved open by a dearth of drum 'n bass styled offerings over the last five years. There is less contrast and unfortunately also less rhythmic intricacy on this album, something which together with the prominence of tablas and Indian vocals hints too closely at the clichéd ""East Westercised"" dance craze. ""Ha"" is several notches above most releases in this genre, but short of the levels of eclectic and rhythmic delight for which Talvin Singh is renowned."
5,wakka wakka woopa,whew!! wot a ...' awesome album! buy it and your life will improve tenfold. no lie.
4,Vintage Mickey Keychain,"I like Vintage Mickey. He seems to have more character than the Mickey now, when every other cartoon character has massive eyes and is rendered in technicolor.A little big and clunky."
4,Pretty Good Workout,"I've been doing the workout a few times a week for about a month now, and it's pretty good. It works both the upper and lower body and gives you a chance to start out slow if you're out of shape and challenge yourself more as you practice. My only real complaint is that it places the abdominals section at the very end of the video as a ""bonus"" section. It's kind of dumb because it comes after the cooldown, so you have to skip the cooldown section and then go back if you want to incorporate it into the rest of the routine. Other than that, this DVD is pretty good for someone who is just getting back into shape."
3,Litter Scooper,"This works OK, but I still wish they would make a scooper that was better in the fine sand that is being used today. Even in the ""clumpable"" litter there are breaks and you have to try to get every piece and these slots just allow the small pieces to go through and be missed. I keep thinking someday someone will get it right, but not yet.The handle could be a little longer so that you don't have to be so close to the dirt and box area. These have to be modified anyway because the scoop are is too flat. Both sides have to be bent in some to make it easier to keep the clumps in the scoop. Still since there isn't much else that work I'll keep using these type since it isn't plastic and doesn't break after a few uses."
5,great scoop,This was just what I was looking for. I had a plastic scoop but it was clumbsy because of the sides. I needed something more flat. This does the trick to get right under the clumps of litter. My only complaint is I need a bigger hole in the handle to hang it up when not in use.
4,Surprising,"Dragon ash is one band that i thought i would never like.I mean i know like 5 or 6 words of japanese and thats it but yet i love them.In my opinion dragon ash have 2 sides to them there first side where they were more alternative and punk ""mustang"" and ""Public Garden...And there 2nd side is more hip hop/rock.""Lilly of da valley"" and ""Viva La Revolution"".But ""Buzz Songs"" captures a fair middle ground between the 2.This cd sound like the most depressing out of the 4 full lengths with alot of acoustic vocals.The standouts on this one are ""Under Ages Song"" and ""Invitation"".They are both great musically.Dragon ash never have failed to impress me and Buzz songs is i think one of there best.However i dont know if its worth 40 bucks.U decide."
3,"Loved the show, but disappointed in the DVD set.","I really enjoyed this series when it was on the TV. Although the first season was not their best, the show moved on to be very successful, even without Lisa Bonet.I am disappointed that this set includes the ""syndicated,"" edited versions of the show that we see today on cable. These are not the full episodes that originally aired, which I would expect to get when spending my money on a box set of the show.What disappoints me even further is that the company that owns the rights to the show don't want to invest in putting the other seasons on DVD. What they don't realize is that seasons 2 forward get better and are the most remembered.What I hope is that they re-release season one, correctly, as well as the other seasons. If they can put reality shows on DVD, which cater to a smaller group, they can certainly invest in this."
3,Hohner Weeender Tremolo Harmonica Key of C,"Simple, this is a suck and blow device. I love the tone it produces but the sound area must be too wide open and takes much too much breath to play. I've had other harmonicas that are much easier to play than this winded device."
5,How could anyone not like this?,"I'm biased too (even though Gerecke mangled my last name in one of the cartoons) but even if I wasn't, I still think it's great--I'm not putting my copy up for sale!"
5,Wake up call Quality in bed experience,"I love to sleep...who doesn't, so when its time to wake up, I prefer a pleasant experience as well. This radio and companion speaker make a dual alarm system and stereo radio that wakes us both up at different times and with with our favorite music/news. I especially like the gradual volume increase as the radio alarm first goes on. It ensure you have awakened without a jolt from sleep.This is a quality product with excellent sound, that has been in production for many years. Originally marketed under the Proton name back in the late 1980's it is still available under the Sangean name."
4,Makes a good Radio better,This powered speaker automatically synchronizes with the radio and provides a true stereo sound. It was easy to set up and so far works flawlessly. I use it in a pole barn when working on vehicles or just hanging out and I am completely satisfied with this item.
5,Bedside Stereo Radio With Good Alarm System,"We purchased the Sagean RS-332 Powered Speaker for RS-330 Clock Radio and the RS-330 Clock Radio as a replacement for a many years old single speaker radio. This radio and companion speaker are a perfect replacement with the clock radio on one side of the bed and the companion speaker on the opposite side of the bed. The two alarms work well and the stereo sound is very good. Although, we had some problems understanding some of the instructions, now that we have figured it all out we are very pleased with the product for our purpose."
3,I love it! But not for moderate fans of Metallica,"It's expensive for just 2 songs. You'd get a much better deal buying Load and Garage Inc for 3 discs worth of songs. However, if you're a big border-line obsessive Metallifan like me, buy it! I cought mine brand spankey new from musicfiendz and it came sealed, sooner than expected, and has a really cool pullout case that i'm not sure how to describe. I've never seen a case like it and I don't regret buying it. However, if you're looking for the best Until it Sleeps deal, I recommend buying the original Until it Sleeps which includes the title track, the demo version and 2x4 live."
4,Very comprehensive,"This is a very comprehensive book for a beginner, lots of facts and tidbits. I have bought others that were sadly lacking in info but this one was very helpful."
1,Online play is a thing of the past...,"Bought two copies of this game specifically because it had free online play. Well, they have been updating their servers and your account will say expired as soon as you create it. Emailed the company, they gave me ONE day of online play and then wanted $9.99/month to renew when my account expired again the next day. I also found during the one day they gave me that there can be no computer players for empty seats... so for me, playing 4 handed Pinochle (the only option for online play) with my friend entailed waiting for two strangers to join us (and that can take awhile).If you don't want online play and you can get this for like $5, go for it, otherwise, it is a waste of money. The company also told me they are focusing on their subscription based casino games and don't care to support this product further. Stay away from this game, and this company's products."
1,Cheats! Can't add and doesn't play by any rules.,"It's like playing with a two-year-old. The programed players constantly cheat or it adds wrong or just ignores the rules. You can't cheat, but it does. After a very short time it's just no fun. Unless, of course, you like playing with two-year-olds.Save your money and buy a decent program."
2,Mainly for Thatcherites,"We need a one-volume history of European Integration, but not this five hundred page panegyric to...Margaret Thatcher? In Gillingham's funhouse, Thatcher is the key figure in European Integration, receiving more attention than any of the individuals who actually tried to integrate Europe, most of whom are dismissed, often in very personal terms. European integration indeed disappears from the book sometimes for sixty pages at a time while the author reviews political developments of right-wing governments in...New Zealand? A very distorted understanding of European integration."
5,What a roller coaster ride!,"This film has everything. Fantastic fight scenes, great performances and a real sense of simmering menace throughout. I was on the edge of my seat as the central character (Gabriel) navigates his way through a deadly world populated by some of the coolest and most threatening characters to be found in any film. Who is Wayne Gerard Trotman?? He has written, directed, edited and scored this film by himself! Not to mention stealing just about every scene he's in (I haven't seen anyone wield nun-chucks like that since Bruce Lee in Enter The Dragon). I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for an action packed no holds barred experience. It may also prove to be a collectors item of the future."
4,Nice meditations,The three separate meditations on this CD breaks the monotony. Good length of the individual meditations about 25 minutes each makes it easy to fit into my day on a consistent basis. Good imagery and nice background music. A relaxing way to start or finish the day.
3,not the greatest or most relaxing meditation,"i use several other meditation cds to help me relax and fall asleep, brain sync has AMAZING options. my husband and i have been struggling with infertility for 7 years so i had high hopes for this one. let me start by saying that the voice over is not at all soothing or relaxing, i tried to tone it out and just breathe and listen to what it was saying.i thought perhaps i was just being too critical so i listened to it again, and same thoughts.save your money folks...its too hard to concentrate and really get into it."
4,Light Summer Romance from a Bygone Era,"One of Loring's better stories. The purple prose she's known for is not as thick as it usually is, and the suspense is carefully thought out.Synopsis: Sonia Carson scorned Guy Farr's advances; in revenge, he seduced her sister and then abandoned her and their small son. Now the sole caregiver of her orphaned nephew, Sonia loses her job and approaches Michael Farr, Guy Farr's brother. Can he be trusted?"
2,Who thought this one up?,"""Can you imagine, I mean, can you imagine"" a musical about spelling bees...it has its humor...and its thoughts...but how many times can you listen to this one...purchase only if you are a Broadway musical fanatic...like me!!!"
3,Not so great,"While the show is probably somewhat cute....I found the lyrics to be not as cute or engaging as those of ""You're A Good Man Charlie Brown"", which this show so clearly borrowed from. It's a rare talent to make adults appear as children (and children as adults)...from listening to this cast recording, I'm not sure if I can give it a second listening."
3,"Enjoyable Cast CD, Though Others Better","After reading several reviews and watching a portion of ""Spelling Bee"" on the Tony Awards, I thought I'd pick up the cd.Lyrically, the songs were fun and reminded me somewhat of ""Avenue Q"", though Q has a much stronger score.Best tracks include:PandemoniumMagic FootPrayer For The Comfort CounselorWoe Is MeI Speak Six LanguagesThe music is fun & I look forward to seeing the show, but the score just doesn't have the depth of the season's other hits: ""Spamalot"", ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" & ""The Light In The Piazza"".Maybe the songs are better enjoyed when actually seeing the show."
1,Great voices are wasted on an uninspired and BORING musical.,"This is without a doubt the worst musical I've ever seen on Broadway - or perhaps anywhere. The music is monotonous, forgettable and uninteresting. For basically the same theme, but with stellar music and lyrics, buy AVENUE Q, which is sheer genius."
1,Unsuitable for kids.,I bought this musical thinking that it would be fun for my daughter to listen too. Little did I know that some of the songs were very off color. I was really disappointed in it.
5,a must see,"all who can get to nyc must see this show. it is amazing, and halarious. the cd just gives a hint into how funny the show is."
3,Realistcly Bizare... Finn!,"If there was a 3.5 on the stars I would give this that. The show is not by any means bad. The lyrics are phenominal! William Finn is a master of words. However the whole thing just doesnt give me chills. So I would recomend this to anyone who likes Broadway or Finn. As a show full of ballad... this is not it. It is a show of characters, so if your looking for some character study this might be a winner. My favorite songs are ""My Unfortunate Erection (Chip's Lament)"" and ""Pandemonium."""
5,funny and,"very funny and smart plus the songs get stuck in your mind, not as great as Avenue Q but it has some great humor.... still love it"
4,Better in Person,"I recent saw this show and have to say it was so enjoyable to watch. I would like, many other reviewers, compare this show to Avenue Q. But, they differ in many ways. In Avenue Q the music is the focal point of the show; where in Spelling Bee the book is the focal point. I find the music has a Stephen Sondheim quality to it. The music for me conjures put memories of the musical and the different quirkes about it. I recommend seeing the musical before buying the CD, you will enjoy the CD much more after seeing it. I do have a beef with most of the reviews because they forgot one of the best songs in msucial, the I Love You Song. Wonderful music to that song!"
4,Amazing,"Let me tell you, I saw the show about a week before the Tony Awards and it's an amazing show. The entire cast of 20 something individuals playing these characters is something to be seen. It is hard to listen to the music and not have seen the show because it's really what is happening with the character on stage during the song that makes it what it is. If you don't like the CD, look for a synopsis of the show and follow along. You'll love it. From A New Brain to this...great show!"
4,Funny new musical,"This is a funny musical.... it's nice to see a new musical that is not taking the easy way out by ""creating"" a musical out of previously written music but rather creates it from scratch."
3,Smaller than the average dino toy,"The other reviews comment that the size of this dino is not to scale. That may be the case. I love the look of this dino despite the size. I am not a dino expert, my child just loves to collect and play with them. So, from a casual user, I think they should have made it larger. I think the price for this dino is lower than others because of the size being smaller."
4,"An enjoyable, easy read filled with mystery and love","This book appears to be the first of a series involving the five members of a security agency. Reminiscent of Dee Henderson's O'Malley series, the five are a tight group, forming family for each other. They solve mysteries while falling in love in the most dangerous situations. In this case, Lily is running from a stalker. She hopes Josh can handle her past as Josh deals with his own past mistakes. While not as intense or as long as the O'Malley books, SHELTER FROM THE STORM is an enjoyable, easy read."
4,A nice escape,"Mix two people with troubled pasts, a little romance, a little mystery and this is what you get.The story was well done for this genre with characters that you could care about. There was a lot of stereotyping and predictablity, though. I like the added bit of mystery/suspsense that was put into this and could imagine this story being expanded into a regular novel, and a series. The message of trusting God was good too, and not overly preachy. All in all, a nice way to escape in a book."
3,good message,"The characters aren't perfect and that's what I liked the best about it. Its just very poorly written and the books are so small! The distributor is harlequin (the people behind those trashy romance novel), and they recently started their inspirational line of books for Christian readers, obviously to make money. Its just annoying."
3,Super Reader,"The Final Encyclopedia is a storage facility that is supposed to contain the sum total of human knowledge, as it is possible in this universe. When information is power, there will be conflict other such a store.The two figuredheads for this struggle are the more than human characters Hal Mayne and Bleys."
1,If you love military SF then skip this,"This author wrote the Dorsai-novels which are readable, with ""Spirit_of_Dorsai"" perhaps the best. However the credibility of the Dorsai-novels, already a little shaky, is compromised by ""The_Final_Encyclopedia"" (I have a thick book, so probably more than Volume I).Anybody who has read anything on military history (other than comic books) will find this a highly objectionable book. The leading character is supposed to be a super-super-soldier, but all he does is snoop around (serving as a spy) and gathering information from which he finally draws a conclusion that is so stupid as to be beyond belief.Probably has too much magic in it to be counted as SF. Not well written either."

Not well written either."
4,A very good read for those that like sci.fi rather than pure fantasy,"I first read Dickson's work, Dorsai !, in 1977 and the periodically picked up the Childe Cycle books which is the series that essentially culminates in ""The Final Encyclopedia"". Specifically :The Genetic General (1960)Necromancer (1962Warrior (1965)Soldier, Ask Not (1967)Tactics of Mistake (1971)The Spirit of Dorsai (1979)Lost Dorsai (1980)The Final Encyclopedia (1984)I prefer these older sci.fi. books to the current crop of fantasy works that ever Dickson indulged in during his later years (Dragon Knight Series). I suppose there's precious little difference between dragons and spaceships however I haven't read any factual accounts of anyone riding a dragon in the 20th or 21st centuries. Note that these books aren't particularly deep and make for a good restful read when you have the time."
1,Gary Glitter - the anti-Elvis,"Glitter is more famous for his sex crimes (the latest in Vietnam) than for his pathetic music. An Elvis-imitator updated for the so-called glam rock scene is all he was, and the lyrics of his songs are pathetic.Glitter, in fairness, can do some good songs like an okay version of Elvis' early hit ""Baby let's play house"", but - that's just what he is, an Elvis imitator who is okay to see on a seaside holiday, but not to buy. As for his own songs, they suck. Maybe his sex crime activities in the UK and Vietnam have biased me, and I think that nobody should support (inclusive of buying his CDs) or have sympathy for this man."
1,Don't Bother,"This guy is a convicted paedophile and is currently wanted for questioning about co-habitating with a 15-year-old girl in Vietnam. Now I haven't heard his music, I don't recognize the songs, but considering how sick and twisted this guy is, I would strongly recommend you avoid buying his albums!"
1,Vision of Italy (region free - blu-ray),"It was supposed to be a ""region free"" disc, it was not (I made 3 efforts). No one bothered to provide me with a ""region free"" blu-ray or finding out if it actually excist. I observe they still advertise for ""region free"" ""Visions of Italy"" so they obviously don't care much about complains."
2,who touched the soundtrack???,"Still the same beautiful scenery, and warm narrative, but not entirely the same musical score as the original WLIW21 version. I was disappointed that some knucklehead took it upon himself to alter any part of this fine program. Do they think they made it better? That no one would notice? It's all over television, and anyone and everyone who has seen the original will be disappointed.Hey Amazon - did any of you guys notice?"
2,Monotonous Aerial View,I got this as a gift from my wife a while ago and finally got around to watching it. Had I known what it was going to be like I would have returned it before watching. Although I applaud the effort of the film crew for the time spent and quality of aerial photography I didn't like this perspective of Italy. I found the video to be monotonous. The descriptions were very plain and lacked interesting detail. I fell asleep a few times during the view.I agree with one other reviewer. Italy is best seen up close and not totally from a helicopter. I don't think I'll watch this again.
2,Visions of italy,"I found the dialog very difficult to understand and the music was very loud. The photography was good, however due to the poor quality of the sound I was not very interested in watching the dvd. I am returning this product."
1,This is truly a beautiful DVD of Italy,This is such a beautiful DVD of Italy. Made me want to book a flight right away. It has wonderful pictures and panoramic views and helped me feel like I was there in person.
5,An Aerial Vacation,"Absolutely like being there. The perspective adds to the on ground experience. You simply must purchase this video as well as visit in person, again and again. Germany will be purchased next."
4,Not the best of the series,"We've bought most all of the Visions series and the earlier ones seem better. This one is better than the last we bought, but it still has a lot of material which seems redundant and ancillary, and at times they rush by and trivialize something of more interest. If you've never been there, it's a great overview. If you have, there isn't much chance to relive your memories before they fly on to the next stop."
5,Love Italy ????? This is a MUST,"If you have ever been to Italy,If you have ever wished to go to Italy,Or if you have even just thought of Italy,You must see this video,You will watch it over and over and over again."
4,Scenic delight,"To be watched over and over, if not for the scenery at least for the music. Bonus footage equally appealing. Can't go wrong if you are interested in this part of the world."
5,Visions of Italy,This is a beautiful product. You don't have to be Italian to love all that you see. I am lucky because I am Italian!
4,Simply Beautiful,"I bought the ""regular"" dvd set as a gift for a friend, and previewed it on my dvd player...very nice...then I bought the Blu-Ray set for myself -- awesome. Blu-Ray really is incomparable, and the difference is very very noticeable. At times it seems almost 3D.The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is that it does not give you the opportunity to play the videos without the soothing narration by the ""Oh-So-Italian"" lady...ok the first time, but would prefer to watch the dvd's with only the music (which is quite soothing).ps: In case youre new to all this: you must have a blu-ray dvd player, and a high-def tv. Blu-ray dvd's cannot play on regular dvd players."
4,Great interview and short concert in a beautiful setting,"The setting is wonderful, the group ""Il Divo"" is TOP NOTCH, unique among singers today with worldwide appeal, gorgeous to look at, and totally masculine. The interview piece is most enjoyable and informative giving a little insight into the personalities of the young men and how they came together. The concert is short with some of their signature songs but most enjoyable. Since there are only two DVD's available, I'd recommend them both to anyone who enjoys beautiful, exciting singing, regardless of the language, Italian, Spanish, French or English. The 4 star rating is due to the short length of the concert not the quality which is certainly 5 stars."
2,visions of italy,"""BACKGROUND"" MUSIC NEEDS TO BE EDITED AND BETTER MIXED. THE VOLUME SETTING OVERWHELMS THE VOICE OVER ALL TOO OFTEN.HELICOPTER FOOTAGE NEEDS TO BE MIXED WITH ON THE GROUND SHOTS AND REAL PEOPLE COMMENTARIES OF THE SITES ILLUSTRATED."
2,Closed captioning,"These DVDs are beautiful to look at but, unfortunately for those of us that are hearing-impaired, they are not closed captioned. I was very disappointed that, in this day and age, a product would be produced without providing this important option."
2,Stupidest voiceover,Beautiful views spoiled by utterly banal commentary delivered by an irritating female voice trying to be seductive
1,More like an Italian Screen Saver,"Yes, the images are beautiful - and the quality is good. But after all these arial circles I felt dizzy. If you are looking for something to prepare for your trip to Italy this is NOT it. The information you get is minimal and the eductional effect is zero."
2,Region A only !!!,"Unfortunately, Amazon didn't published nor warned that this Blue ray is Region A only, therefore the only way to watch it in other parts of the world is in computer with Blue ray ROM installed.What a pity."
2,Zone Locked,Amazon needs to be better about(start?) stating whether a disc is region locked or not. I buy dvds/bluray discs for viewing in USA and Europe. This one does not work in Europe.
5,Great Tour Without Baggage,"Why leave your city and fly in a plane to this beautiful place when you don't have to. The narrator is wonderful and delightful in giving the excellent tour of all of Italy. So .. sit back and enjoy--great viewing after a long day at work. Wonderful tour for the entire family. Yes, if you have a baby, put the child in the rocker or your favor seat and your child will fall fast asleep...dreaming of Italy:)"
4,Unusual scenic overview,I was pleasantly surprised by this 2 disc travelogue. The aerial views from a helicopter were breathtaking. This colorful collection is a welcome addition to similar overhead videos of countries of the world.
5,Great album,"First i would like to say to those people who spend time dissing singers how immature they are. If you don't like Guy's music, listen to something else. Don't waste your time just to say bad things about people. Guy is an extremely talented all-ound recording artist, NOT just a lucky reality show winner. He co-wrote 10 out of 14 songs on this album, and he spent 6 months overseas doing it. It's one of the best album I've ever bought, and he is definitely one of the best R&B vocalists. This album is clearly more polished than his first one, which was a rush, and is more high-classed and styled than the first one, which was a bit too cute and safe. It's definitely a stand-out idol album."
5,Learning to type,"I am an adult recoverying from a injury and decided learning to type would help me with my recovery. I wanted something fun and this is fun. The only problem I have had is the program crashes every now and then but that maybe due to my typing, such as hitting a wrong key. I would definitly buy this for children."
3,"Good, but only up to Win98","I got this for my children and it seemed great. Very shortly thereafter I retired the old PC they were using and upgraded to a new one. Part of that upgrade was to use Win2K Pro for web security. None of our Disney CDs are compatible above Win98. Good software but incompatible in the new millennium. ""Disney... surely you can do better than this."" (And please do.)"
2,Boring! Boring! Boring!,"While this program appears to be cute and engaging at the onset, it quickly becomes very boring. My daughter likes the ONE game, but can't get past the first row of typing because it's so monotanous. There is nothing to challenge her to keep going and improving - no incentive. Just more boring repetition like we had to do in high-school."
3,A bit dull,"It's probably more fun than any other typing game, but its still repetitive and boring, which I suppose, is what learning typing is like. Not recommended for young users less than 6 years old who have already played Humongous games, because they will ask to play Freddi Fish after the novelty of this game wears off."
3,"Some of it's good, some of it's bad...","OK, it's a fun way for my young kids to learn the basics of typing - splatting bugs by pressing the right keys is pretty fun. The price was unbeatable.The down side: It teaches only basics - letters and numbers. No shifted keys. No ten-key. It also runs only with the CD in the drive. It is also very difficult to install on Win2000/WinXP - you have to create a shortcut on your desktop for the setup.exe program on the CD, change the shortcut's compatibilty mode to Win95, then install the thing. Yeesh. BTW, don't accidentally hit (or rest your wrist on) the Windows key while you're typing; it royally messes up the color palette - to the point of having to quit and start over.It got my kids started with typing in a fun way, but it was a bit of a pain to get it working. You win some, you lose some. This was a draw.:-|"
5,THIS PROGRAM WORKS IF YOU GET THE PATCH,"My wife (Ettin Cub) wrote a review today and was a little unfair. If you go to the Disney Interactive website you can download a patch for free which will resolve any issues the program may have with windows XP.That said, it's an excellent program. Our children are begging to play, and are getting to be almost as fast as typing as we are. Well, maybe not as fast as I am."
5,IMPRESCINDIBLE MAP OF ANCIENT HERMOPOLIS MAGNA,"Since The British Museum carried out a series of excavations during the mid '80s onward, in El-Ashmunein (ancient Hermopolis Magna, the seat of the ibis-god Thoth), the first thing to do was mapping the site: this is the (excelent) result of such an undertaking, for which we must congratulate the sponsors and the author(s). Mainly interesting is the photographic recording of the present-day (upto 1981) conditions of the ancient town-mound. The fold-in map, obviously, is the most valuable contribution, as it is a very detailed record of the topography and surface conditions of the area. If you plan to go to Egypt and to visit El-Ashmunein, you must own one of this!"
5,One of the Best in British TV,I love this series -- and have both Series 1 & 2. What can we do about getting Series 3 & 4 released on DVD?
3,ok,"I had to put a foot pad thing in these to keep my foot from sliding forward. They are versatile but the side straps sometimes twist a little and look a little awkward. Overall, not bad once the ball-of-the-foot pads were in."
3,super cute but uncomfortable,these are so cute but they fit really tight around the straps. they are also really uncomfortable over a short amount of time. maybe i just haven't broken them in enough? really cute but i'd suggest ordering 1/2 size up.
1,Garmin Street Pilot III training video,"I was under the mistaken impression that this video would train a new person in how to use the Street Pilot III. I purchased the Street Pilot III from Amazon.com and this video popped up as a recommended additional purchase. The video is only a few minutes long and is only intended on introducing store sales people on what it is, not how it works. I would not even recommend it for the intended audience since the first time someone asks you a question about the product you will be stumped unless you read the directions to gain familiarity with the unit."
1,Poorly made,"Arrived in little pieces, so I had to send it back. Then they send me a replacement that arrived broken as well.Poorly pack, I don't think they care at all."
4,As advertised,"Beautiful product, no problems with shipping or delivery. It's great on my counter - adds color to the kitchen and I drop a small cutting board on top to save the knives!"
4,Amazing Pipes. Amazing Range. Looooove her!!!,"I first discovered Jane (yes, you'll find I'm late jumping on the bandwagon) while listening to her mesmerizing, hauting version of ""Over the Rainbow"" during the closing credits of an otherwise so-so film ""Sky Captain..."" Ever since, I sought out her music and found that, despite her youth, she's been in the jazz scene for quite some time! Her album of classic film covers ""Taking A Chance On Love"" is probably my most-played album on my iPod (was fortunate enough to purchase the album with two exclusive tracks ""I Should Care"" and ""I Wish I Were In Love Again"")... so now, I'm so excited that I've got tickets to one of her shows in The O.C., and then to find that her latest album is a collection of Moheit-ized holiday songs is just...Yay!!!Alas. The only reason this doesn't get the full five stars? Uh, can Sony make it possible to make DualDiscs iPod compatible? Geez. I know Sony's got pod envy, but good lord, make your discs compatible!!!"
1,Contains malware!,I had to return this album to Amazon after receiving an emil from them stating that it contained Sony malware.Poor Jane! Caught up with these creeps!
1,DualDisc won't play,"I love Jane, but I'm going to have to return this CD because the DualDisc will not play in either my car or on my computer. Worthless to me, I have no idea if the music's good or not, since I can't get it to play."
2,"Adieu meaning, hello stylistic frou frou.","Jane Monheit's debut album was beguiling, and this outing has a few moments that shine, but for the most part she has grown increasingly absorbed in making hip sounds and doodling around the scale Sarah Vaughn-like: sound without meaning.On this album, for the most part, she could be an alien replicating human language as an experiment in intergalactic communication. Where's the emotion? Where's the feeling? Ah, youth! She may have entered the great wilderness of artistic development which in the old days of show business went unrecorded. One day, perhaps, she will start concentrating on the meaning of the words she's singing again, and stop sounding like an ultra hip midi file."
1,too garbled,"I am sure there are some good ideas in here, but the language is very technical and the writing is poor."
1,Chipped and cheap.,"I could not wait to get this, but when it came the chain was so tangled in a bag it came in it took ten minutes to fix it, I would not even bothered to untangle the chain if I had looked at the ruby first, there was a big chip on the top of the heart. I had the thing wrapped and ready to ship back in 5 minutes, I was so mad. I will never buy any jewelry again online."
5,Comfort Zone to Learning Zone,"As an experience-based facilitator, I begin every session, workshop or program talking about ""challenge-by-choice"" or in Bill Treasurer's words Right Risk. Treasurer has done an excellent job of deep diving into teaching and challenging the reader about moving out of one's comfort zone into the learning zone or growth zone. The learning zone is a state of disequilibrium where habits, values and beliefs get challenged. Treasurer is thorough, insightful and an excellent story teller drawing the reader into personal self-discovery of one's approach to taking risk. As a collector of critical thinking questions, Treasurer offers some of the best. I have learned that good questions work on you and are transforming, perhaps more so than the answers. The topic and the principles Treasurer writes of in Right Risk are timeless and deserve a place in one's library for constant referral in these complex times."
2,Wrong Title,"Okay, with the great cover photo and title, this appears to be a book about risk evaluation. Almost.It should have been titled ""Righteous Risk"", or ""Feel Good Risk"".It's about how to feel about taking risks, which can be summed up in two pages.Nobody likes to take risks, not REAL risk, anyway.True adrenalin junkies don't need a book like this.The rest of us, the ones taking the real risks in life,need a guide for risk evaluation. This ain't it.So what is? Try Makoff's book ""Get Off the Fence"".Not great, but it's more real-world."
4,"Shot Glasses, Chet Baker, and a Streetcar Named Desire","""Maybe my sorrow and intensity scared you, or maybe, life being as it is, it was just bad timing."" -Jeri Cain RossiJeri Cain Rossi has lusted, loved, and lost. She has divulged her heart on paper, all the while vowing never to be so vulnerable again. Nevertheless, Rossi remains a hopeless romantic who fearlessly sheds her self-imposed exiles to follow her passions. Her sojourns may not yield everlasting love, but they inspire some of the most sincere, poignant, and memorable fiction of our generation. Jeri, I raise my glass to you."
5,"it was very interesting,and i thought very presisive","from what I remember it was up to date and very accurate. I served with the author while in vietnam, so far in all his books his memory his pretty presise. tom if you get to see this please get me another copy of this book. I had a copy when they first came out, I was to send it to you for you to autography it, never got around. I loaned it out , now after a year I forgot whom I loaned it to.yours truelySSG John Pasquale Class of 65-66"

3,watch out,"This cable has a male s-video connector on one end and TWO (count em, 2!) RCA connectors on the other. This cable is not sufficient to convert an S-video signal into composite. So if you are looking for a way to plug your S-video only DVD player into your TV that lacks an svideo port but has a set of free RCA's, this WONT do the trick. The 2 rca's seperate the video signal into black and white and one that is blank. Im guessing it splits the signal's chromanance and luminance between the two rca's... but whatever - it's not gonna do the job I wanted it to do so if you're looking for an s-video to rca adapter look elswhere."
3,"Coming of age, not much plot.","In this well-crafted coming of age novel, Silverberg exquisitely describes a far-future world, several alien species, and the internal and external journeys of one young man. Although the opening hints at a great action tale, the action is mostly confined to the discoveries the main character makes about himself. An excellent read if you're seeking fiction about seeking. Otherwise merely an ok way to pass the time."
3,A Different Kind of List,"Admirably appointed DVD of a largely forgotten 70s international production. After Italian partisans attack Nazis in Rome, a vicious and disproportionate reprisal is undertaken. Burton plays the German officer tasked with assembling the names of those who will be executed -- it's like the opposite of Schindler's List as we see the banal bureaucracy of this hideous undertaking. The rather dull action scenes at the start of the picture take up too much time though, and the dramatic heart of the piece doesn't get the attention it merits. The script could have used some Robert Bolt-style depth. Burton's good as the conflicted German, counting on putting his consciences' fate in the hands of his soldier's remove. Marcello's less compelling as the priest who put's the German's acts into perspective. (And Leo McKern overacts a storm.)"
5,breathe new life into your lantern,"purchased for a four-buck flea market 200A (which also sports a nice new amber globe from jafe decorating) - and now i have a wonderful, powerful single-mantle gas lantern in bright red! many times you can restore a non-working Coleman lantern by installing a new generator (but first try by oiling the pump cup)... although i always strip down old lanterns (completely removing valve from the fount, and then cleaning the air valve and re-stretching the air valve spring), a new generator may be just the thing your old lantern needs to come back to life!"
5,Fantastic Fix,"The old lantern runs like new now!It's a bit tricky to install without damaging the light bag things (mantles) but after installing the new generator the old lantern is brighter than ever!Well, almost.The old mantles were made with a slightly radioactive material that put out more light than the newer mantles, but that's not the fault of the generator!"
5,A compendium of 102 marketing strategies to meet sales goals,"Marketing Playbook: The Manual for Growing Organizations is a compendium of 102 marketing strategies to meet sales goals. A football-style theme and trappings capture the reader's eye, but at its heart Marketing Playbook is all business. Tips, tricks and techniques include the basics for creating a good business card, how to create a series of ""thank you"" postcards with impact, using web conferencing to give a sales presentation without leaving one's chair, how to break through voicemail, and much more. A surprisingly intense amount of detail on each topic and full-color photographs on every page distinguish Marketing Playbook as a top-quality reference and resource for marketing professionals."
5,"Fun, creative, concise and complete marketing for growth companies","This book is very engaging, in fact, hard to put down. As a seasoned marketing executive, I am often disappointed with marketing books yet this one was a pleasant surprise and loaded with useful information. John's suggestions are easy to implement and focused on helping sales make sales! Too many marketers focus on brand image to the exclusion of lead generation and customer aquisition. What good is a brand if there is no money in the bank! This book will keep new and seasoned marketers in growth companies on track with cost-effective ideas to ring the sales bell. An excellent feature is a list of sample vendors and the approximate cost of various ""plays""; this alone will save new marketers research time and money and allow them to maximize tight marketing budgets for maximum results. This book is worth every penny and there is something inside that will work for every type of business."
5,Superb Checklist & Bullet Points for Marketing Campaigns,"This is a very unique marketing book, because it not only gives a very broad perspective (102 specific types of marketing strategems) but it distills each strategy into its essential ingredients with succinct action items.From trademarks and streaming video to trade show promotions and PR buzz, every single page condenses years of experience into a straightforward set of instructions, with resources and road-tested vendors you can use to execute your plan.I think this text has real potential to become a classic marketing book. Every marketing, PR or marcom person can get significant value (and fresh ideas) from this in as little as five minutes. This isn't just a re-hash of standard marketing practices, although it's a useful resource for that; many of these tips are new and innovative media approaches that few companies are using. It shouldn't take much effort at all to earn your investment in this book back 10X. I really do like it."
5,great value for beginners and pros,"This book has relevant and valuable information for those new to marketing and also for seasoned businessmen. I highly recommend it.Jeff PietaPresident :: All Information Services, Inc."
5,Wow! Wow! Wow!,"I've got Cafe del Mar, I've got Costes, I've got Buddha Bar, I've got Thievery, I've got St. Germain but this, this, is OUT OF SIGHT! A must have for any down tempo fan. BUY IT NOW!"
1,Foreign movie with English subtitles,"I did not realize that this was a foreign movie with english subtitles. While I do like foreign movies, subtitles aren't exactly the greatest for a ""kids and family"" movie when the audience is a 9 and 5 year old. I should have read the description more carefully. Personally, I do not feel any foreign movie with subtitles should be classified as a ""kids and family"" movie, but rather, it should fall under the ""foreign"" category."
1,Truly one of the worst Calc books ever,"This book is the equivalent of that arrogant professor that assumes his students are stupid. I have taken Calculus several times (picky colleges won't accept Calc credits.. UM, UA, HU) and eventually I even taught Calculus. Texts like this are the reason why people hate math. The examples are nothing like the practice questions, the warm up (early questions) have very complex answers and the text itself overuses mathematical jargon to further complicate things. Even the equation and trig reference charts are crap. Calculus is designed as a basis for higher level math. If you make it ugly and confusing from the beginning, it spawns entire classes of students that have a weak foundation and end up more confused and frustrated later on. When the semester ended, my copy sat in the fireplace. At least it was useful for keeping warm, because it certainly was no good at teaching math."
3,good not great,"For someone who dosent consider math an easy subject this book could have been written better, my biggest problem with the book is that it only gives the odd solutions, i can understand if it were a junior high math book, and they were preventing kids from just copying answers down, since this is a college level class anyone who would do that probably would be failing all the tests anyway. Also step by step directions would be nice too, on many of the problems the show two or three steps in one sequence and you're partially left to figure/guess what they did and how they did it. I compare this to several chemistry biology and physics Solutions manuals that give much better detail that is more easily understandable. All that being said, it was still helpful to have, and with a little extra effort it worked out to be a good buy for the price."
4,Visualize,I liked how this book gave many detailed graphs to help explain the concepts. My only complaint so far is how it vaguely explained to apply the Divergence theorem and then gave a pretty ambiguous picture that was pretty worthless to understanding what exactly it applied to.
1,Fine for those who already understand calculus,"This textbook is generally understandable, however, it seriously lacks thorough explanations of basic concepts. It is clearly written for the math proficient, not those who always struggle, even if we've made it up to the calculus level. Two major problems: 1) Its explanations are in math-speak, making it difficult to understand; 2) It contains exercise problems that were never explained in the chapter. My professor seems to think that its okay to put those problems in the homework. The result is that I am guessing and working backwards from the solution to figure out how the heck the problem is solved, and I usually don't get it. I took precalculus with Blitzer's textbook, which is far more interactive, application-based, and clear. Is there a calculus textbook as wonderful as Blitzer's precalc?"
2,Stay away from this book!,Examples are too hard to follow which makes this book difficult to read. I spent the whole semester crashing my head on the wall because of this book.Better get Calculus by James Stewart
1,Terrible Textbook,"While I understand it is difficult to write an advanced math textbook without weird notation, this textbook seems to be written for PhD's who already know calculus. The examples in the chapters aren't always that good. The practice problems give very little practice. As one problem is completed successfully and you move on, the next problem has a little twist to it that isn't covered in the text. The student is left on his own to figure out how to negotiate the twist and solve the problem. You never feel like you've really practiced because you rarely get more than two or three basic problems solved. I believe it is a classic example of college textbook scam of using a new edition each year that adds a lot to some professor's wallet and little to the progress of the student."
2,mat,ordered it for my 1994 jeep very disappointed too small would not recommend this product for a jeep poor product
3,Check book when you get it.,"I gave this to my 6 year old niece who is just learning to sew. I am sorry I did not send it back, as there were a lot of scribbles in it. I think I may have gotten a returned book. It is not worth sending it back with an extra fee. There are a lot of good ideas, so I am not faulting the content, just the condition the book came in."
3,Outdated,A little outdated but good for teaching basics. My seven year old wasn't that interested in the provided projects in the book. Thank goodness for Pinterest!
5,Great fun & excellent instruction,"This book rocks, per my 8 year old. She loved the practice exercises, and reads the book without help. Highly recommend it!"
4,Great book!,"I got this book in order to help teach my 7 year old daughter to sew. It is a great book to help teach. There is a lot of following the dotted line with the sewing machine, which helped teach her to control the fabric while using the sewing machine. I highly recommend this book if you are trying to teach or learn how to sew."
5,This is the book I learned with,"With the help of my mom, I used this book to teach me how to sew. It is very interactive and fun. Definitely a great book to learn from. The projects are easy to understand and fun to do. A great book for a beginner--young or old!"
4,Sew much fun,This book has some interesting exercises and information for the junior sewer. Good pictures and text. A good beginner book for a youngster.
4,Josie's Sewing Machine Items,This was for my granddaughter's 6th Birthday and she loves it. The order was processed quickly and arrived in good shape. Everything seems fine.
2,"If you're looking for FUN crafts, KEEP LOOKING!!","I bought this product because I wanted fun crafts for my 6 yr old (soon to be 7) daughter. The crafts were not impressive at all. They were actually rather boring. The fabric burger is absolutely useless, it would have been better if it were a pillow or something. I would have liked more crafts she could use or decorate her room with. I do like the Helpful Hint for sewing and the instruction and introduction to the sewing machine. I decided not to return the book because it was only $11.53, and I didn't pay any shipping."
4,perfect for my 8 year old daughter,Bought it for my 8 year old daughters who wanted to start learning who to saw. Easy to use and they got the hang of it very quickly.
4,Its working good,The laptop is working good. Delivery was fast.I like it.This is the best deal for the price.I see a horizontal line on the monitor. I hope this screne holds up for a few years.
2,Not even cold on arrival,"The royal jelly was not in any ice packed container or anything to keep it cold. I am curious to know if the sender even realized that the item would thaw within 12 hours. That's all well and good if it is shipped frozen, but if there is nothing to KEEP it frozen...the item will thaw and possible spoilage will occur! The color of the jelly upon arrival was yellow, not creamy white, too.Anyway, I will not be purchasing any further products from this company."
3,Expensive Replacement Leak Air,"These filters cost almost as much as replacing the entire mask. After using these replacement filters, I would recommend just replacing your existing mask. These don't fit like the originals, which means the seal isn't as good. And, when it comes to air filtering, you really don't want leakage. My mask now leaks air even though I've taken pains to get these filters seated correctly. The fact is that they are probably made to the same standards as the original filters, but, overtime, I imagine the mask itself gets stretched, so, by the time the filter wears out, it is time to replace the mask because replacement filters like these just won't likely fit snuggly enough no matter how well they are manufacturered."
5,Just Wonderful,"Listening to this CD, I understood where does SON cubano come from. Buena Vista social Club is in a deep debt to Guillermo Portabales. If you are in to cuban music, this CD is a must."
3,America as Athens,"The authors are impressed that Sparta defeated Athens. America is dangerously weak on defense, they argue, just like Athens. My reply is that vast expenditure on defense did not save the USSR. In fact, it was the reason for its collapse.History repeats itself all right, but never exactly. This much we know. Besides, this book is not enlightened by any non-Western history, of which the Kagans know nothing.The Kagans are certainly right that history tells us that your enemy could be an unexpected one. Churchill writing after WWI had no idea Japan would be Britain's enemy, and no one in 1917 could imagine Russia becoming America's mortal enemy for four-and-a-half decades. Those who think China is going to be trouble should take this lesson to heart."
4,Better Basic intro book,"This is a better intro book than Master Posing Guide by Wacker. For your money, only purchase this one. Took job with portrait company and this book covers everything in their training guide. Recommend also getting The Portrait Photographer's Guide to Posing by Bill Hurter as a worthwhile guide to expanding your creativity, if you are serious about portrait photography."
3,Useful guide,"Posing is allways a difficult aspect, and there are a few useful hints in this book. The view is quite narrow: senior portraits, and mostly female. And, only posing is the subject - f.i. lighting is quite monotonous through the book. But, worth it's price."
4,Posing Demystified,"As a budding amateur photographer looking for advice on how to capture better portraits of individuals and groups, as well as get some ideas for memorable poses. I found Bill Hunter's book to be the most useful of the 2 I purchased, the other being ""Posing for Portrait Photography a head-to-toe guide"" by Jeff Smith. The posses/images in Mr. Hunters book had a real Art/High Fashion quality to them, they were very distinctive. While Jeff's images throughout his book felt like High School senior headshots and poses, and I worked on my award winning annual staff in high school, so I know what I speak of. Both had good tips but Mr. Hunters book provided more depth and detail on how-to achieve the desired result."
4,Great book!,I enjoyed the tips the book gave- it was a great intro into portrait posing. I have been able to implement some of the tips and have definitely improved my shots!
3,good tips,"good tips for models or those being photographed. the tips are fundemental, and help you to learn the ropes, however it probably wont change your life. i would reccomend to models with no photographic experience."
3,show ur subject posing better,"Hi,My all dear photographers freind this book is good for us to understand what type of pose given to our claint.If u wan't to use some new poses then buy this book .Thanking u,Maulik Sheth.(INDIA)"
2,"Well written, but poses weren't that great","I found alot of the poses in this book to be quite ugly to be honest. I guess i just dont like his style of posing people. Apart from that, it was pretty well written and very easy to read, there were lots of pictures to show you what he means."
4,"""yehha"" - worth for penny","It contains only and the details posing for teenager to adult, but not glamor ""nudity"" posing (as author state his philosophy about the ""glamor""). Woth the ""$""Well I need 2 more books to be feel completed that it composition and lighting techniques.4/14/2008, Since this is my first book regrading to posing. After weeks of read, and see the pictures begin look ""award, weerrr"" but I still don't know why. I loan book ""posing... by Bill Hurter"" I realized the pictures tilted the model head extremely and some time ""hurt"" such an unnatural look. I have to change to 3. But Amazon not let me do that."
3,"Great book for it's purpose, but beware of same information in other books by same author.","Although I disagree with others who say this book should have been cominied with lighting. Both are different concepts and I have other books on lighting so did not want to read about it here.I purchased two books by this author1. Posing techniques for Location Portrait Photography2. This book, Posing for Portrait Photography- A Head to Toe Guide.Although the content was good if you want a book on posing, and yes most subjects were high school seniors, but the two things I did not like are:1. Same stories, same lessons and almost identical books with two differeny names.2. So many points taught about hiding flaws such as over weight, less than perfect subjects, but almost every example was almost perfect subjects with no bad models.Would I recomend this book? Maybe for half the price, but do not buy more than one book by this author as you'll be reading differnt versions of the same material."
3,Posing for the mall photographer,"The basic concepts explained in this book is informative for the beginner photographer, and it stops there. The book focuses on senior portraits where the main goal is to sell as many photos to mom is possible. Therefore, the poses aim to appeal to the general audience and will seem uncreative and bland. In fact, the author advises you to eschew all of your creative tendencies and simply focus on creating a generic photo that will likely sell. If that's the kind of portraiture you're trying to learn, then this is the book for you. If you already know the basics covered in this book and if you have any artistic aspirations, I suggest you look elsewhere (recommendations welcome)."
2,Posing,"This is a very skinny book.....Some great images but it lacks detailed description.I would not say its bad, but it could be better...."
2,A difficult read,"I do not like the writing style. The book has good content..but it is just difficult to read. So, it is just sitting there collecting dust."
4,pokemon xd,"Pokemon xd is great,even better that colloseum because you can save at anytime except during battles and events you can't do anything but watch.Also there are 83 pokemon to snag!I know a way to purify shadow lugia.First snag it with themaster ball prof. krane gave you then in the purify chambermake the tempo go to the max, then put lugia in the chamber-doesn't matter if other pokemon are in the chamber purifying-and viola! lugia's purified!"
5,Pokemon:Gale Of Darkness,"It shipped fast, no damage to the game case or as far as my eyes can see; the disk. Once I receive the game cube on the 24th I will put up part 2 to this review telling if it actually works or not. But it seems to be in fine condition."
1,It says it plays fine yet it dosen't play at all!!!!,It says it plays fine yet it dosen't play at all!!!! I paid for a game to play but it just says that there's no disc in the console!!!
4,dont be afraid of the shadows...,"the one, the only, the best pokemonw game available west of the mississipi!!! only for the brave at heart and die hard pokemon fan. enough said"
3,Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness,"The game is fun and all but it was almost identical to the first one. But it does pass the time and its longer. Plus they added ""wild"" pokemon, but nothing like the original pokemon games with their wild pokemon."
5,a wow buy,i cant really rate the fun or anything.because i got it to settle a fight between two friends.she loves it so much.it showed up faster then any of the other items before i ordered this.
1,I got ripped off,"I really enjoyed the gameboy pokemon games. I never bought stadium or collosium though, because I liked pokemon for its RPG elements and catching all the pokemon. When I heard that nintendo was bringing Pokemon to GameCube as an actual RPG I was very excited. This game is not a full pokemon RPG; it's nothing more than Stadium/Collosium with a few basic RPG elements thrown in. I'm very disappointed in nintendo, not just for their poor game, but for all but lying about what it was."
5,A great Poke'mon game,"I am a HUGE!!!!!!!!! Fan of pokemon.This game is great!!.Miror B. is back and pathetic! I love fighting, at the collisium.I have two jumpluff and let the music play!"
5,Best 3d adaption of pokemon so far.,"The story and elements this game presents are just plain awsome, nothing can top them even successor games like battle revolution don't come close."
3,Kind of Boring,"I bought this game from ToysRus a couple days after it came out. It was exciting all the way for the first few days. After that, there was not much fun left in it. The game went too fast and made you easily bored.after beating the game, all you could do was capture the rest of the shadow pokemon you missed. The wild pokemon spots are the worst thing in the game. The pokemon that appear there are pokemon you'd rather knock out than capture. It's so annoying that on the spot radar you can't tell what pokemon is at the spot. It only shows which spot is responding.This game was very easy and the makers could have made a better game. They need to improve the types of pokemon you catch and the wild poke-spots.Overall, I am somewhat disappointed at what I have purchased. It is very exciting to capture shadow lugia, but once you capture it, is there any fun left? For me, there isn't."
4,"Good, but bad at the same time","My review of this game, is simple, it was good in some areas, and bad in others. In the aspect of it being an RPA game, i think that it was a total disaster, in the form of it being a fun adventure game, i think that this game hit it off, and deserves a follow-up game, but also, I think that the next game should be more involved with the art of actually CATCHING the pokemon, not just fighting in some arena with them...That's my review....I hope you found it helpful.PS.Oh, and another thing, whoever ""big el"" or whoever that reviewer was, it might be helpful, the next time you review a game on an english site, that you review the game in ......ENGLISH! because whatever you were doing, (not sure what it was) it was sure as heck not english."
5,"Bossanova style, sweet, sometimes sad songs","This disc is by far my favorite, and well worth the price. The songs lyrics are poignant, sweet, and some brutally honest. If you like that Bossanova jazz sound sung by a sweet, female voice, this is a great album. Perfect for those rainy northwest mornings with toast and tea, or background music for an evening of entertaining."
3,Not exactly a great book.,"Some of the projects are lacking in detail. What could have been a good book is not because of this. I was particularly interest in the project about an arcade game machine. There is a lack of info for it, dissapointed after reading this project."
5,Unbelievable!,"Nadine Goellner is one of those increasingly rare singers whose voice is an instrument unto itself. She has great range, strength, and control, and blends the vocals well with the music. Great lyrics, as well."
4,"Nadine, You Go Girl","Saw Nadine at the Purple Fiddle in Thomas, WV and fell in love at 1st sight. Waiting for the ""birthday/wedding"" song to come out on CD. I just loved it! She has a big voice for a little girl, and plays a smooth jazz guitar. Recommended!"
1,Stunning Disappointment - A Waste of Time,"You begin reading this book and hope it will get better...but it doesn't. It becomes so painful that you simply can't give up out of sheer hope it will improve. The only reason it is a page-turner is because you can't believe how bad it is.The story is extremely weak, the characters bland and stale, and the timing is horrific. Le Carre could have spared us all 350 pages of bland writing and wasteful detail, to instead write a short-story of this work.LeCarre had an opportunity to make a statement about many things related to terrorism: it's foundations in a person, events leading to becoming one, how countries deal with and seek to turn the tide. But he doesn't. LeCarre wastes all his time bouncing back and forth, all over the map with his characters, creating a void of any substance.""Absolute Friends"" is an absolute waste of time. Do not bother."
2,"An Angry, Manipulative LeCarre","I oppose the war in Iraq. That said, Mr.LeCarre's rageful, bitter declamation is a disservice to the reader, the story, and, mainly, his characters. Ted and Sasha should have been two of the author's best--baby boomers with major chips on their shoulders and a world of pained idealism in their hearts. Instead, Mr. LeCarre uses their fascinating life arc as a rank device to spew his hatred of American imperialism and my country's reactions to the horrible events of 9/11. At the end, we're supposed to be even angrier than he is at the USA, a country he seems to feel will kill any and every innocent on the planet to shore up its world supremacy. It's a shame. Mr. LeCarre has written eloquent essays expressing his disdain for all things American. He didn't need to resort to his beloved medium, fiction, to flesh out his hatred. This is a sad work of multi-layered character assassination; and the characters are Mr.LeCarre's own!"
2,"Oh, please!","A disappointing novel that reads as though a promising beginning was grafted onto its very message-heavy ending. The author has made no secret of his disdain and distrust of the United States, so this paranoid concoction should come as no surprise. In the anti-American atmosphere that prevails in certain circles in Europe, the idea of the U.S. staging a phony terrorist operation to justify its policies and to coerce European countries probably sounds pretty plausible. That someone with Cornewell's (Le Carre) smarts could offer up a story like this indicates just how far relations between the U.S. and its erstwhile allies have deteriorated. Food for serious thought, but not necessarily for the reasons intended."
1,An author past his time,"This book was a major disappointment. The first half of the book was a rambling montage, with little to do with the main action which occurs in the second half. Le Carre's writing style was disjointed - hard to follow a logical path. The final portion of the book degraded into an anti-American tale, worthy of the respect of anti-American terrorists. Not an enjoyable read."
1,Absolute Balderdash,"There's only one solution. Put Le Carre in the ring with Clancy and let these two relics have at it. On the left, John's slipped his moral and ideological moorings altogether but he can still land an actual English sentence. On the right, Tom is so punchdrunk in his latest he needs a designated typist. One woozy sentence from TIGER tells the whole story: ""The sun rose promptly at dawn.""And the winner? The evil of two lessers."
3,One Pissed-Off Author,"There's no doubt that John le Carre hates Bush, loathes the Republicans, despises the US military-industrial-corporate-oil complex, and detests the US invasion of Iraq. To le Carre, the Bush Administration is only marginally better than the Stasi of old East Germany. Needless to say, he leaves a lot out and selectively ignores a lot of recent history. But it's still a pretty good book. If your a Liberal you'll love it. If not, you'll still want to finish it."
2,Selling a name not a story,I was so relieved to see reviews that panned this book. I was concerned that I must have missed something when I read glowing reviews. This book meanders without any really compelling action and I felt at times Le Carre was parading out his knowledge of 60's politics rather than telling a story. The ending almost absolves the book as it is quite tense and has a bitter twist but it was a lot of work for ten good pages.
5,"A masterpiece, though a lesser work from the Master","I can't say it's le Carre's best. It would have been a great book if it's written by a lessen writer, but coming from the one who wrote Tinker Tailor, one just can't help by expect more."
2,Big Let Down-Spoiler Review,"I've read all but one or two of Le Carre's books and I need to get it off my chest that the ending of this book was a cheap out in my view. The author's writing for the first ninety + per cent of the book was typical and interesting in the way Le Carre usually writes. He had me go through the entire life of this critter, Teddy, having me sympathizing and speculating in each new circumstance. That was very nice, however the pace suddenly sped up and made a messy, truncated job of the sudden demise of...well, actually the plot. The last 30 pages of the book must have been written to get it over with. The last 10 I just skimmed to assure myself that it was nothing more than boring filler commentary by minor characters. It was like, as they might say in Le Carre's fictional world of espionage, all foreplay and the bride fell asleep."
3,His finest work ever?,"You know LeCarre, right? Master of the spy novel. When the Cold War ended, I heard that his writing became obsolete before it was published. I think the world did that to all the espionage authors. Doesn't RED OCTOBER look incredibly dated, whether in book form or with Sean Connery reminding us what a fantastic actor he is?Well, now America has another war, and LeCarre has written what may well be his finest novel. No small praise considering his resume, folks. THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD and all the other Smiley books. I like this one better. And, oddly enough, the ""Large Print"" edition is cheaper at Amazon. I can read it without my glasses."
4,Absolute Fundy Friends,"Teddy Mundy, old friend, is so absolutely believable you smell his sweater.But by design Sasha remains a vague and distant shadow. LeCarre means for Sasha to irritate readers so they marvel at the pearl of Teddy's lavish loyalty to a nave ideologue.In the end though, Sasha is just another ""cause,"" a foil for Teddy's compassion, another person in need of rescue--like Zara and Mustafaa and everyone else in Teddy's life. Teddy is, afterall, an adult child of an alcoholic caring for everyone to his own demise.So you are pulling hard for Teddy, absorbed in his every movement and thought and hope and his new wife and kid and in the end you don't see the cheap lefty sucker punch.And that's where the novel fails and crystallizes into political cant so ridiculous that one can only conclude LeCarr was in a hurry to get this one to press. When it turns out Sasha's crazy fascist conspiracies were correct all along you get an ending you suspect a 19 year-old Deaniac might have written."
3,Slow throughout but good ending,The first three-quarters of this book bored me. I really enjoyed the final quarter or so.
2,2/3 of a good book,"After the disappointing Constant Gardener, I thought I might not even give this one a look--and sad to say, I should have saved myself the money. I think that after all these years, le Carre just can't keep his politics from interfering in his art. For 2/3 of the book, we have credible characters and an interesting plot; then it all goes away in a polemic with cardboard characters and a plot made up from the fantasies of the radical left. Too bad...he was always such a find writer."
1,He ripped off G K Chesterton!,"The book feels like two and I didn't buy how he connects the two. The first part is cold war stuff recycled. The second is his diatribe against the war in Iraq. The glued together pieces of his story ultimately portray Islam as noble and stoic and the West as evil and probably deserving of what they got. The observant reader will undoubtedly see similarities in the story line with le Carre's other works such as ""A Perfect Spy"", ""The Looking Glass War"" and, yes, even ""TSWCIFTC.""What really put me over the edge was le Carre ripping off lines from one of G K Chesterton's ""Father Brown"" stories. If you read the book and didn't catch it, it was the part about what the best joke is.Don't waste your time on this book. If you want good reading, start with Chesterton. His books are easily and reasonably available from Ignatius Press."
3,Far From His Best,"I concur with (most ) of the other reviewers that ""Absolute Friends"" is not up with LeCarre's best work. My impression is that he's been wrting this book (two deeply flawed characters, bound in a relationship of East vs.West) for the last forty years. It's not very interesting now, and I hope he gets back to the level of some of his better books."
2,A 200-page page-turner. In 464 pages.,"I picked up 'Absolute Friends' on the recommendation of a friend and my general like for LeCarre's work. I cannot remember the last time that a simple work of fiction of this length has taken me so long to read. Most disappointing is that I couldn't put it down because of the seeming promise of something truly spectacular about to happen -- but as the pages on the right side of the book got thinner and thinner so did the content. Mundy was a brilliantly-penned character, many of the entanglements and relationships are truly interesting and engaging, but unfortunately all this does is serve to engender false hope in the reader for a climax that will never come. The end of the book reads as if LeCarre was on contract for a certain number of pages and bailed as soon as he reached the minimum."
3,A LITERARY LION IN A CODE PINK DRESS,"This book is not up to the author's high standards of novelistic arts. In fact, at times it seems little more than a vitriolic editorial disguised as a novel. The author uses his characters as mouthpieces to voice his anti-Iraq war sentiments which amount to little more than the usual ""Bush lied, babies died"" slogan of the Left. He should confine his editorializing to his essays and be about the business of creating the fine fiction of which he is capable.The plot and characters were mildly interesting at best. At the end, I felt cheated and was sorry I'd invested the time to read it. I hope the author resists the urge to slip into his Code Pink dress for future novels. The color is unbecoming on a man of such tremendous talent."
1,Confusing Friendship,"The biggest problem I have with this book is the ""friendship"" of Ted and Sasha. I just don't get it. We keep hearing that Sasha is ""charasmatic"", but he sure doesn't seem so - not in the '60's and not in the present. He just seems like an angry teenager, who can't stop railing against his father. And Ted - let's face it - is only slightly more interesting.Although I agree with the anti-Iraq war message of the book, it really becomes tedious, and it's not a good enough reason to read this book. I did hang in until the very end, which just seemed tacked on. It didn't build to this conclusion, it rushed to it.If you are looking for a story with boring and confusing characters, but with a strong political message, read the book. If not, pass on it."
4,Not quite as good as usual,"I'll admit, up front, to being an ""America-hating liberal"" who agrees with about every statement Mr. Le Carre makes in this book. I'm a card-carrying dubya-hater and sometimes think I would love to move to Canada. That said, this is not Mr. Le Carre's best work. It is a rant disguised as a novel. Which is precisely what Le Carre intends, but if readers pick it up looking for his usual nuance, subtlety, and moral shadings, they will find it lacking. The first 300 or so pages are vintage le carre, as they trace protagonist Ted Mundy's life from birth through a shadowy cold war spy-land. But the last 150 pages are an excuse for the author to vent his spleen, which doesn't come naturally. It's rushed, poorly plotted, and disappointing. However, on the whole the book is a fairly good read, a good story, and thought provoking, and I'd recommend it- even to a conservative."
5,Absolute Friends,"Le Carre's finest novel since ""A Perfect Spy"". Chillingly believable with the typical Le Carre ""everyman"" hero who has typified his work since the Smiley series of novels. The unlikely protagonist, Ted Mundy, and his alter ego, Sasha, are doomed from the first page, and even they seem to know it. As always, beautifully written and choreographed. One of the best anti-establishment, anti-war, anti- big corporate owned government novels written in the past 25 years. Right up there with 'Our Man in Havana"", ""The Quiet American"", and ""The Ugly American."" Not for those who wrap themselves in the flag (whether the Stars and Stripes, or the Union Jack) and believe that might is always right."
2,100 Words or Less,"As a casual fan of Le Carre, I headed into this novel with mild expectations. Yet, even that minimal emotion was too much. His writing style is excellent, as usual. His characters are well thought out and complex. Everything seemed in place ... and maybe that was the problem. It was all so mundane. True, he's not known for action-packed spy thrillers (and that's what I appreciate about him), but in this case the dialogue and plot plodded along. Maybe it might pick up the deeper I read? I'll never know because I ran out of curiosity by pg. 100."
3,Puzzling,"I'm not going to rehash the plot, enough reviewers have done enough to remove most of the mystery from this book. I like John le Carre's work, I think of him as the thinking man's spy author. As usual, everything comes over so detailed, so realistic and so ultimately depressing.My puzzlement is about the finale. I think I understand what happened, who did it and why, but it just doesn't make any sense to me. If le Carre's somewhat hidden perpetrators wanted to make a big statement about, or against, people who opposed the Iraq war, I'm sure they could have made a much bigger statement, for far less money and much less byzantine plotting. They are so obviously in control of the spin doctors, that they hardly needed to set up such a complex plot just to kill a couple of has-been people nobody had ever heard of.Or am I missing something?"
1,Anti-american nonsense,"This was a slow reading, boring book that one kept reading out of respect for the authors past offerings, hoping for it to come together, but it never does and ends in an almost science fiction anti-american conspiricy found in cheap ""America is Bad"" fiction. Almost James Bond in reverse.Don't waste your time."
2,The usual,"The same boring Le Carre characters with a dash of anti American sentiment thrown in. The author doesn't like us but he isn't too proud to take our money, it seems."
2,A major disappointment,"Over the years, I've eagerly sought out and read every one of Le Carre's novels. I looked forward to this one just as much, and in spite of some of the claims here, wasn't at all offended by any ""anti-Americanism"" in the book. Perhaps that's because I didn't really encounter any. Somewhere about two-thirds of the way through the novel, I realized I didn't care. I didn't care about the plot. I didn't care about either of the major characters. I had absolutely no interest in who eventually did what (assuming someone finally got around to doing anything). Life is too short to read books just because the author used to get it right. I'm just glad it was a library copy and I hadn't sunk my own money into this."
1,how have the mighty fallen,"Lecarre fall from the pantheon of great writers has been sudden and suprising. This book is unbelieveable boring. As you may know this novel is vehemently anti-war, but that is not its downfall. No matter hat his position on the war, that was not the reason for my poor rating. This book is weak, no character development and no excitement. It plods along like a snow monster in a blizzard. With 3 straight disappointments, maybe Lecarre should step aside for a newer generation of spy authors."
2,Australian SF Reader,"This book is too long and too messy, and for a fantasy book, none of the characters were interesting enough to put up with for that long.A man and a woman, mythological and historical characters that you have probably heard of, but changed in this book, end up opponents down through the ages, a conflict that his its root in their original meeting.The first part is not so bad, then, blah."
3,Interesting plot,I picked up this book several years back in hardcover and really enjoyed it. The characters developed well and the author provided some historical insight into ancient times. The thing to note is that there are four books in the series and some of the books are better than others.
2,"Same Themes, Different Cover","If you've read The Wayfarer Redemption, you're likely going to feel a sense of déjà vu. There's the strong, magical man, and the woman with a destiny calling, and there's the legacy of an ancient empire to restore to grandeur.Hey, it might have worked a second time, if the characters weren't so odious. While I eventually felt some small sympathy for Cornelia, who at least shows some positive changes in her personality, the other characters might have gotten swallowed up into Tartarus, and nobody would have much cared.Perhaps in future novels of the series, the male protagonist won't be a jerk, through and through."
1,ugh,"This book was utterly dissapointing for a sara douglass. It's a confusing (but somehow manages to be boring) plot, and it's waaay to graphic for its own good....Cornelia, Sara Douglass's main character (actually I'm still not sure WHO are the main characters) is a pompous, arrogant spoilt brat, and she doesn't have much of a character at all. Her husband, Brutus is not much more than a complete and total .... The characters do not really support the story. Nothing that they do makes sense.Also, she mixes different types of mythology, which I must say brings out a totally confusing and muddled theme.This book is NOT worth reading. If you want to read REAL fantasy, read Sara Douglass's other books like Starman, or Beyond The Hanging Wall. Just don't waste your time with this one:("
4,intriguing and easy to read.,"I read this book imediatly after trying to force myself through another verbose fantasy book. I am glad to say that this book was refreshingly easy to read. Thank goodness! I am sick of fantasy books trying to emulate Tolkien!Not only was the book readable but enjoyable. This may annoy some readers, but I enjoyed the fact that characters were not static, that characters were not 'good' or 'bad' and stayed that way. Characters who at one stage in the book I felt sympathetic for, by the end I just wanted to punch them. And I enjoyed that!Overall, this book was a good read, and I recomend it to anyone who has a love of fantasy or a love of history :D"
4,Wow great book,"This is one of the most enjoyble reads I've had in a while. Duglass takes readers into a world of lust, deciete, love, and honor. The descriptive use of the body may limit the amount of readers that are intressted in this book. However, I believe that anyone who reads this book will fall in love with the great Sara Duglass. I anxsiosly a wait the next book."
3,"If I weren't a fan of Douglass, I probably wouldn't continue the series","With Hades' Daughter, Douglass kicks off her 4-book series ""The Troy Game,"" in which descendants of the ancient Trojans journey to a new, foreign land where, with the assistance of The Game, they begin to build Troia Nova. Along the way, they capture Cornelia, a Greek princess who is brutally forced into marriage with the Trojans' leader Brutus. Brutus ultimately plans to abandon Cornelia for Genvissa, the woman whose mystical powers will ensure that he and she will reign as king and queen.Unfortunately, none of the main characters are particularly likeable, so I didn't find I had much emotional investment in their well-being. Also, ""The Game,"" referred to many, many times, remains even at the end of the book a somewhat confusing and nebulous concept. I do like Sara Douglass, so I'll still finish the series."
3,"Oh, What Could Have Been...","Douglass made a bold attempt in this book, and in several places she nearly succeeded in writing a fairly well-rounded story. However, she has a long way to go with this series.I enjoyed the characters very much, and empathized with them all. his is not to be taken as I LIKED them, mind you. Cornelia does not become likeable until halfway (at least) through the book. Brutus proves interesting at the beginning, but at the end I was wishing he would fling himself off a cliff in a fit of kingly rage.I do believe this book would have been fantastic if Douglass' writing style hadn't jarred so horribly with her chosen setting. This book reads as clumsily as a 7th grade English essay. That this book was even published without some serious editing gives me hope that one day my piddly manuscript will be snatched up by the same agent."
2,None of the camp of Xena nor the beauty of the real thing,"Oh lord where to begin. There is something so innately wrong with a modestly talented modern writer who cannot leave the modern age behind her when composing, who insists on recasting classic figures in a pseudo-classic style that threatens to break the fourth wall altogether by the end of the trilogy. Ick. These characters are sort of the stock from bad twenties movies, with the dialog to boot.Now, on the good side. There is less of the silly, predictable stuff of the Wayfarer Redemption, Douglass's earlier effort, though the curses are as flat here as the prophecies were there. The characters are still not very well drawn, but they are somewhat better. On the whole, Douglass is improving, but this icky combo of fakey modern classic era god-knows-what is still not worth paying hardcover price for."
2,Not as satisfying as the Axis series,"I so enjoyed the Axis books that I expected more of this one. The main characters were all rather shallow & predictable, not what I expected from the previous novels by Douglass. It seemed as though the slow start turned into a hurry to tie everything up in the last chapter. I don't plan on purchasing the sequel."
1,One of the worst books I've read on this subject,"I can't believe that anyone would think this book was worthy of printing. The author's goal seemed to be filling the pages, not giving useful information. Perhaps the publisher felt that people would buy the book just because its title contains the word ""Sexual."" As far as content goes, the book was shockingly disappointing. In comparison to other books in this genre written by physicians, this book is so Mickey mouse that I can't believe its author, Wuh, is truly a doctor."
1,Doesn't last,This will be my 6th thighmaster purchase. Everyone of them has snapped in half within a year. I have tried other brands..but their resistance is too weak. It seems to me that this product could be made much better and last a lot longer.
2,Bought two and spring broke in both,"Poor quality materials. We bought this Thighmaster Gold after the spring in our original Thighmaster (blue) broke in half, and now the spring just broke in this second one. My wife did like using it, while it lasted."
1,2nd one that has broken now,"Have bought 2 now and both within a couple months of use the spring broke, come in Suzanne summers fix you product, maybe you should make it in America"
5,It is a must! A Classic! The theme of the new Century!,If the Business environment is as smart as it should be this book should be a Best-Selle
3,Poor reception,"Initially I liked the unit. Nice and small, good sound (with earbuds)and quality construction. However I found the reception very poor. I live in an isolated area so I can pick up only 4 local stations. The problem is some stations ""bleed"" all over the dial and interfer with reception of neighboring frequencies. I guess I need digital tuning."
2,Nothing to rave about,"After hearing about this radio, I decided to purchase it thinking it would have great reception. But when I tested it out it picked up so much interference that I couldn't even pick up a few of our local stations. Only two channels came in clear. The only good thing is that the built-in speaker sounds reasonably good for such a small radio. Unfortunately I listen to a lot of other stations which I couldn't pick up on this radio, so I'm sending mine back."
4,Almost perfectly designed,"I've had this product for over 8 months and would like to say that it has been the best little radio I've owned. However, like all portables, the headphone jack is starting to warp and the connection to the headphones is starting to lose coherence. For some strange reason, Sangean placed the power switch right next to the headphone jack so that every time you switch the radio on or off, you have to swivel the headphone jack out of the way. This incessant wear is the reason why the connection is starting to deteriorate. I wish Sangean (and other manufacturers) would address the inherent problems with the placement of headphone jacks because I have always encountered this problem. Otherwise, the AM reception is great and FM is good, no problems."
4,My secret work radio,"Being the consummate news hound I must have access to radio at all times. This little radio is perfect at my office where radios are frowned upon. The battery life is very good when earbuds are exclusively used,and for covert ops I switch to a single earphone in black I found at Radio Shack. Reception is better than I expected and,I agree,the wire length of the earbuds is inconvenient. FM sound is excellent with the Bass Boost! For the money this is a great buy!"
4,"For the price/utility, a nifty product","I bought this because I wanted an extremely small radio with both AM/FM reception that was almost credit card sized for use on commuting trips on Amtrak. Overall, I am pleased, and at the price point--quite pleased. It runs on one AAA battery for a long time (replaced once in 1 year). It is small enough to hide in an inappropriate location (say, a classical concert) to hear a game :). Surprisingly good FM sound through the earbuds--the small speaker is not very useful.Small downsides: uncomfortable, hard earbuds--recommend replacements with anything compatible; paint on radio case easily rubs off; and due to the size, analog tuning is trial and error. A digital tuner with presets would be a plus--but I note that similar sized radios with that feature are almost 2X in price. Overall, a very good, very small, low-power, ""hideable"" personal radio."
3,its a alright head set for the money,i got this set to where i can use a chat program and talk with my friends it has great sound but as every one has said the plastic cant take much abuse my cat sat on it and bro it in some places tape works fine i suggest on spending a few extra bucks and getting a better head set
5,Great Candy!!,"This is my favorite Jolly Ranchers flavor!! It wakes up your mouth and has just enough ""cinnamon fire"" flavor without being overpowering.I grew up with the Jolly Ranchers Fire Stix and it was a pleasant surprise to find the Cinnamon Fire flavor in the individual hard candies."
5,Sweet Old Fashioned Candies,Length:: 0:24 MinsThis candy is very sweet.It's also tart.I don't eat much candy so the back lasts a long time. Since it's a hard candy it also lasts long in your mouth.I'm sure you're familiar with Jolly Rancher. Many flavors of fruit flavoer are here and I like to savor the sweetness now and then.
5,A Spicy Difference!,"If you love cinnamon...you will love Cinnamon Fire Jolly Rancher hard candy! They're a great break from the usual peppermint, spearmint and fruity hard candies that fill the candy racks. The only problem is that they are difficult to find. The only store in my area (Albany/Latham/Saratoga) that sells them is K-Mart and they are constantly out of stock. Thank goodness for Amazon!!! Cinnamon Jolly Ranchers took the place of my cigarette habit...I don't know what I would do without them!!!"
3,Cinnamon Fire Hard Candy,"I love Jolly Rancher hard candies but with the cinnamon fire flavor, not so much. They just don't seem to live up to the term ""fire"" maybe Cinnamon ""warm"" would be a better choice. I'm not saying these are bad, just not as hot as one would expect from something called ""fire"""
3,Love Love the Fire Jolly Ranchers,What I do not like is the candies were cracked and in pieces so when you opened the wrapper pieces of candy goes everywhere. All twelve bags were that way.
3,One Bag Missing,I was very disappointed to find the inner package of my shipment broken and one bag of the twelve I ordered was missing. No response was ever received from my complaint.
3,Good,They came all squished together in a little box and actually they were kind of dusty. Still taste good though
5,As a math person,My mother is a teacher and has used these books in her class. Since I graduated from college with a Mathematics degree my mother likes to use me as a reference when she has questions. After using/reading these books I find them to excellent math books. These books are elegently written and expose children to math in a way that I never saw until I took classes in college. I guess what I am saying is that these books are fantastic compared to programs that I was raised on. I only wish I had a program like this when I was a child.
4,Very Cute!,I bought this book along with some others dealing with twins. It was very cute and was exactly what I was looking for. Graphics were fun and I loved the rhyme.
2,simple AND dull,"I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my almost 2-year-old twins. It got such great reviews that I didn't bother to check it out through interlibrary loan first. On the positive side, the illustrations by Thierry Courtin are very sweet. This is the same illustrator of the ""Tchoupi"" series of children's books, popular in France. Okay, back to THIS book. I couldn't believe I had shelled 12 bucks out for it. Can a book be too simple for a young toddler? YES! If this book had been a small carry-along book in board book format, I would've rated it a bit higher. Having it in a large hardcover format is overkill. I have to keep my hardcover books out of reach from little hands, and this book was so dull and unispired that I certainly was never going to reach for it. I sent it back at my own expense to Amazon. First time I've ever done that."
1,BE CAREFUL!,This game has been recalled because of problems with the dance mat. That is why it is no longer available from retailers. Nintendo is working on fixing the problem and then will re-release it. Buyer beware!
4,"Fun to play, good exercise","This is great to play with a group of people especially since you can include all ages. It's got ok music with easy, medium and hard levels and an exercise level with a calorie counter which is fun but it seems like you work really hard just to burn three calories, but they only count if you hit the arrow correctly I believe. I know that some of the pads that are out there that aren't made by nintendo are easily damaged, and I heard that they are remaking this game, but I'm not for sure on that."
4,this is a game for hard core DDR fans that don't have a PS2.,"I am a huge fan of DDR. I play it at arcades and at parties. The only thing is that I don't have a PS2. I have the game on my comp and use a converter to play but it isn't the same. I knew that when I bought this that it would be a disapointment to me as a DDR player, but it is fun to play none the less. You have to unlock all the songs by playing the story mode. The songs are only chalenging on very hard. I enjoy playing all the same. I like the work out mode feture. Over all if you are a fan of DDR but don't have a PS2 then get this game."
5,Having fun and getting Excercise...is it possible??,Yes it is!!! My son got this for Christmas...we've been thinking about getting some sort of DDR for him but my mother (with guidance from me) went with the Mario Mix. One reason was that since my son is a video game junky we figured that he'd get more enjoyment out of it since it was a familiar charachter instead of just a bunch of music he's never heard before. I've even gotten into the MIX!! With the workout mode you can track how many calories you've burned...its great!!! We're searching for another mat because we want to battle!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR KIDS AND ADULTS!!!
1,broken,"I was surprised to see this still for sale. It was discontinued a while ago because the pad breaks. If you are buying it now, it is used and likely already broken. If not, it will be soon."
4,I loved it but it was also very short,this game was awesome i love it :D but the only problem is is its length. i beat it in 2 hours. then i tried it again the second time and i beat it in 1 hour and 29 minutes. even though it is really short it is most definetly really fun. i reccomend to people who like to dance or people who dont like to excersise and want a fun way to excersise. give yourself a challenge and do it on hard mode with no breaks ;). i love this game :D
5,This is so much fun!!!,"I think that this game is fun and really gets you moving. Some of the songs are really easy and you don't do much, and others are really difficult and get you working. One of the songs that I can think of that is hard is Bowser's Castle. If you are a Mario fan but doesn't like a huge challenge, this game is for you. I completed the game within 1 hour and 30 min. There are several levels of difficulty on the game. The story mode only has easy and normal. The free mode has easy, normal, hard, very hard, and super hard. But to play free mode, you have to unlock the songs in story mode. But overall, it is a wonderful game."
3,Poor connections in the back,The connections in the back are very difficult to attach.Otherwise it works ok.
2,"Not the highest quality, ports are a pain","I ordered this because it was Amazon Prime and I needed it the next day. I had two main issues with this:1) One of the knobs was not glued on well enough and just spins around (so one port is sort of lost). I only needed 3 so this is not a huge issue for me.2) The ports that you connect the wires into are a HUGE HUGE HUGE pain in the butt to deal with. The wires come out repeatedly.It does work, but there were multiple other products about the same price range that if I had more time, I would have selected. This needs to be re-engineered and taken up a notch."
5,"Suspense, steamy, and hooked","These books are just one more way to get you hooked into this wonderful series. Absolutely wonderful. I have completed the entire set now and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys shapeshifters, vampires, raising the dead, and hunky, dreamy descriptions of men."
3,Fun paranormal mystery with a dash of romance,"I was reluctant to try this series because I've heard so many disparaging remarks about how the series devolved into a formula of sex scene-transition-sex scene; repeat.But I read an interview given by Laurell K. Hamilton in Writer's Digest that painted a different picture. She said that there isn't a single sex scene in the first five books. And even then its hardly the crux of the books.So I decided to give this omnibus of the first three a try, and guess what? No sex. There is romance of course, but primarily these are mysteries, and fun ones at that. I am prepared to jettison this series if and when they begin to live up to (or should I say down to) their bad press, but in the meantime, Go Anita!"
3,GOOD STORY BUT LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED,"IT WAS A GOOD STORY AND HAS GREAT POTENTIAL, BUT HAMILTON OVERUSES PHRASES AND COMMENTS THROUGHOUT THE FIRST 3 BOOKS. I HAVE SERIOUS ISSUES WITH STARTING A SERIES AND NOT FINISHING IT, SO I'M SUCK READING THE REST. THE STORY IS GOOD. LOTS OF ACTION BUT OVERDONE EVEN FOR A VAMPIRE SERIES. HAMILTON OVERLOOKED SEVERAL ERRORS IN HER STORIES. LIKE IN THE 3RD BOOK. HER CAR WAS TOTALLED BUT THE NEXT DAY SHE DROVE TO WORK AND THEN MENTIONED LATER THAT SHE NEEDED LARRY TO DRIVE HER BECAUSE SHE HADN'T HAD TIME TO GET A RENTAL. SO WHAT DID SHE DRIVE TO WORK? AND SHE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE IF VAMPIRES CAN COME OUT DURING THE DAY OR NOT. ONE WILL BE ABLE TO, BUT THE NEXT ONE WILL BURST INTO FLAMES. I'VE REREAD SEVERAL AREAS TO SEE IF I'VE MISREAD SOMETHING AND TOOK IT WRONG. I HADN'T. LIKE I SAID, IT HAD POTENTIAL TO BE A VERY GOOD STORY, BUT THE WRITING SEEMED A LITTLE LAZY. I HOPE THE REST OF THE SERIES IS BETTER SINCE I'LL READ THEM REGUARDLESS"
3,more worn than i thought,"The dust jacket of the book was more worn and dirty than I thought. The Dust Jacket was pretty stained on the inside, all up and down the inside flap of the jacket. Also, there is a pretty noticeable and large stain of some sort on the bottom corners of the pages, something that wasn't mentioned in the details of the purchase. Some nicks at the top of the pages, but other than that it's fine i guess. I wouldn't consider this book in Very good used condition as the seller put it though. I think it's just plain old used. I guess I get what I paid for :("
5,Darkside,I was taken for a ride in this book. All I can say is this isnt a happy ever after book or a soft paranormal book..This book is for the serious Vampire reader who wants to see the darkside of life. Where sometimes what we feel and what we think isnt what we always do. The lines that we promise ourself we never will cross.. And when we do it is always cause we had to do for a love one or a good friend...
2,confusing texts and tacky decorations,"The overall apperance is very confusing, although there are some fine tips for baking. The decorations are old fashioned and sometimes even tacky. Too complicated for begginers and not interesting enough for advanced cooks..."
5,Cake decorating techniques made very simple,"This book was very helpful because it had a lot of easy to follow step by step photos, especially on piping royal icing. There were lots of beautiful cake ideas and some great cakes for kids. My favourite was the basket of flowers, which was stunning and much easier to re-create than it looks. There was also a brilliant little boy's cake of a cartoon crocodile swimming in a pond which was fantastic! Wedding cakes are also covered in this book, plus a christening cake, christmas cake designs, chocolate cakes, fresh cream cakes, meringues, profiteroles and spun sugar....I could go on for ages! I found this book great and really enjoyed it."
3,so-so,I learned a few things from this book. The thing I did find helpful in it is the directory of how to clean virtually avery surface. The basic cleaning tips taught though are very minimal and are things that most people already know.
4,"Not as good as ""Emotional Rollercoaster""","Vivian Green had two big club hits in 2005: ""I Like It"" and ""Gotta Go, Gotta Leave"" which both went #1 on the U.S. dance/club charts. Neither one of these are as impressive as her debut solo single, ""Emotional Rollercoaster"", which is one of the best club songs of the last decade.Of the mixes on this CD single, only Junior's ""27th Street Mix"" stands out. His mix fires up some energy out of an otherwise pretty bland song. He brings the necessary diva-side out of this record. The rest of the mixes on this single are really not worth much of anything."
1,Way too flexible...and kind of goofy,"These glasses are awful. The entire frame is so bendy that it has trouble keeping shape. The glasses are way too big for my head and there is no way to tighten. If I shake my head they come flying off. Because of how flexible these are, you can't do anything about it. They just feel cheep and honestly they look that way too. Disappointed!"
2,Not exactly what you get,"glasses were too big for my head, & I have a big head.lenses are NOT blue, they are a blue mirror tint coating. actually more of a smoke color."
3,"Good, not great","These are reasonably priced, offer good eye protection against both flying hazards and sunlight, and look pretty good...not ridiculous like so many uber-sized safety goggles. They are a little light and feel somewhat cheap when they're on your face, but if you want sturdier safety glasses, spend more money."
3,Good; not great...,"This is an enjoyable record, however, for me, I keep skipping over a couple of songs that just don't make it (semi-rap numbers)......in fact these particular numbers seem out of place on an otherwise great set of tunes."
4,can someone help me with some information?,"i was wondering if anybody could help me. i am an art student and am taking a class having to do with artifacts. we are to pick one we relate to and do a study on it, find information and then make a piece related to it. my object is a mask from sri lanka, just a mouth, made from fabric and real teeth. the lips are red, the teeth white, and there is grass around the mouth dyes purple. i can not find any info on a mask of this sort from sri lanka. if any body has any information, please email me at jessicaraebrown@hotmail.com i would be most grateful! thank you"
3,Worth Getting,"Spermbirds are one of the few true German punk bands around. Growing up both German/American I got to taste both cultures during the punk days. The best possible Spermbirds sound can be found on 'Something to Prove' & 'Nothind is Easy' (their first 2 albums) but Common Thread is also a good listen. The Spermbirds were what half of today's American punk bands which they could be. Raw, fast, aggressive in your face punk telling you what is wrong today and what needs to be done about it. They truly had an original sound which, sad to say, not many American punks got a chance to hear. This is a good step in hearing this incredible punk music, but trust me and listen to the first 2 albums for a complete Spermbirds awakening."
4,We liked it,"My children, 7 and 4 both loved this book. The illustrations were as beautiful as always and I enjoyed the look at sea animals caring for their young, and father sea animals at that. The story was typical Carle in my opinion--we enjoy his books primarily for their inventiveness and beauty.They start discussions in our home rather than spell it all out for the children.Once again, loved the fathering in this book. It's worth a peek just for that interesting insight into sea life."
5,Gorgeous Book,Book arrived in perfect condition. Illustrations are beautiful and children will love the fish camouflaged behind the acetate pages. One of my favorite Eric Carle books.
5,A fun peek-a-boo book,"What a great book! This is one that my child reaches for when it's time for stories. The clear pages make the book exciting and my little one is always curious as to what is behind the plant or rock that is painted on the clear page. When she turns the page, there's a new species of a father fish who is taking care of the eggs or his little fish family. Eric Carle is such a clever writer and a creative illustrator. Check this book out, you won't be disappointed!"
3,Beautiful artwork...disappointing storyline,"Mr. Seahorse and Mrs. Seahorse are going to be parents! Mrs. Seahorse lays the eggs in Mr. Seahorse's pouch and then he has the job of taking care of those eggs until they hatch. As he waits, he meets several other father fish who are in charge of their eggs or babies. In the end, the babies successfully leave Mr. Seahorse and his life goes back to ""normal."" This is a beautiful book--in typical Eric Carle style--with amazing artwork and soft colors befitting the ocean. The storyline, however, leaves much to be desired. It's a unique idea, as this book tackles various creatures of the sea that usually don't get specific mention in picture books, but the method falls short of it's potential. The ending is quite abrupt, and readers will feel something is missing. Overall I was disappointed with this book."
5,Another Great Eric Carle Book,"Mister Seahorse is a great book to teach children about fathers raising or caring for young. Set in the ocean, the book profiles seahorses and several types of fish. With several clear plastic pages, the book also teaches camouflage."
3,Not what I expected,"We are huge fans of Eric Carle's books, but the storyline did not flow well at all. It was over my child's head, although he loves the pictures which are beautifully done. I agree with the other reviewer--the story ended abruptly and just wasn't as well written as his other books."
3,I like it better than my daughter,"Beautiful illustrations, of course. I especially like the cellophane (yet sturdy) pages of reefs, etc, that show how various fish are able to camouflage themselves. The back of the book explains in more mature language how this book is about the many fish species in which the fathers are primary or co-caregivers - we can argue about whether this should be unusual in the human species but I think the reality is it still is, so I have no problem with the message or story. My 30 month old daughter, however, simply loses interest. The book is too long and repetitive (with Mr. Seahorse greeting each new fish the same way, and there are a lot of fish to greet.) Right now the book doesn't get pulled from the shelf unless I do it, and she wanders off after a few pages. I'll try to remember to edit this review if that ever changes."
3,Decent story,The story was a bit different but fairly predictable. I liked it and it's a good read for the beach.
4,GOOD VACATION BOOK,It was a nice easy fun vacation read. The spirited characters kept me engaged to the very end. And just when I thought I had it figured out...
2,The Villa,"I was very disappointed in this book. I have been a huge fan of Nora Robert's for years but I think this is the worst one I have read! The problem was she never fully developed the characters. There were too many different story lines going on so you never really got to know any of them well. Sophia and Tyler are supposed to be the main characters yet you go several chapters without them being mentioned. I also felt like I was reading a Sidney Sheldon novel with all of the conversations between the police! Because there were so many characters I felt as if she was not able to develop the whole sabotage plot and the real reasons behind it were. I hope in her next book, she gets back to the style that she excelled at before with less characters and more well developed ones!"
3,Too many characters - not enough depth,"Please know that I am huge fan of all of Nora Robert's work - however - I find that The Villa is not up to her usual stanard of giving her characters life. This is probably due to having so many characters at one time. The story is ok, the description of Napa Valley beautiful but Sophia and Ty could be so much more."
2,Not her best...,"If you enjoy Nora Roberts page turners, try The Reef, Montana Sky, Hidden Treasures, or Three Fates. I found the two main characters in The Villa flat."
2,Definitely not her best work,"I did not like this book because I did not feel drawn to the characters or the storyline. If you want great reading from Nora Roberts, I highly recommend Carolina Moon and A River's End. While reading the Villa, I found myself reading ahead to the ending because I did not care about the characters to engrose myself into their pettiness and insecurities. I found most of them self-absorbed and unnatural. A teenager named Maddy was probably the most redeeming because she actually brought a sense of reality to the idiots around her. The character of Tyler had potential at the beginning, but eventually lost his appeal and charm. Save your time because this was a huge disappointment for me."
1,Ghost rider perhaps?,I am a huge Nora Roberts fan. This did not read like a Nora Roberts book. The details and descriptions were there but the typical chemistry and flow were missing.
4,Villa by Nora Roberts,"The Villa is an easy read. The author obviously understands the process of creating good wine and uses this to advantage; the details enhance the story and add to its 'validity'. I consider this novel a good read for a plane trip,when lazing on a beach, or nestled in front of a fire on a cold day."
3,a hybrid novel?,"The Villa seems to try to transcend the Romance genre and become a mainstream novel. It doesn't quite make it and the genre novel probably suffers too. The pace is too slow to please most Romance readers and there is not enough tension and suspense. For a current romance/mainstream novel that has strong mystery and suspense, see the novel Always. Nora Roberts is certainly writing about a social world she knows well, being of Italian background herself, but she does not succeed in getting that world and cultural history across to readers who do not share that background. Roberts is to be encouraged for trying to transcend the genre, and one hopes that in her later novels she has been and will be more successful."
2,Disappointing,"I have read almost everything that Nora Roberts has written and eagerly await each new book. This book was very disappointing. Sophia seemed determined to prove that she could behave and live her life as any male and still be considered feminine. The other characters were alternately weak, deceitful or just plain corupt. The ending reminded me of real life. The bad guy/female doesn't always get punished for their ill deeds. I did learn something about the wine making process but I could have found this information under wine growing in the library."
3,The Villa,"Definately not one of Nora's best. The end was anti-climatic. Best one of her books was River's End, Reef. I was disappointed. Sorry Nora!"
3,Another reader disappointed,"I will second some of the earlier comments concerning being disappointed by this latest work from Nora. After reading her books since 1984 and always enjoying her work for its consistency, I think this book seemed a bit rushed. There were too many characters, no one was fleshed out. I found Sophie to be a bit annoying. I think the dialogue was pretty good as this is always Nora's strong suit but... I also was very disappointed by the ending."
4,This should be a movie,"I bought the unabridged tape version of The Villa. The reader was excellent, and Nora Roberts painted a picture of the Villa and the heroines of the story so well that one could picture their faces, their emotions and almost feel the energy of The Villa. I would definately recommend this book for purchase. It's not just a romance story; it's really a good ""book"" and a great listen."
4,A Great Read,"Overall, this was a great book. I am a huge fan of Nora Roberts and I was not disappointed in the least with this book. The story was great, the characters, however, needed more deepth. There were a lot of characters, but it was pretty easy to keep them straight. I would love another novel on David's kids, Maddy and Theo, maybe another book that expands on all the characters some more. The love story of La Signora and Eli would be awesome story also. This book made me want to head out to Napa and learn more about wine!"
2,Brutal ending,"Wasn't anyone else bothered by the ending of this book? How can one justify taking the law into one's own hands and decide who has paid retribution for murder? I was horrified by the ending and disgusted with all the women characters. Roberts in trying to make them strong failed miserably, by making them above the law."
1,Flatter than day-old champagne,"This was the most disappointing Nora Roberts book yet. There were too many stories going on so the characters weren't developed as they should have been. There was no chemistry between Tyler and Sophia as they were either boring (Tyler) or self-centered (Sophia) and unlikable. The story was mostly about Sophia and her mother and grandmother and it seemed as if the men were thrown in as an afterthought. If you feel you have to read it because it Nora's newest, save your money and check it out at the library. It's not even worth the price of a paperback."
2,What a disappointment!,"This was the first book I read by Nora Roberts, and it will probably be my last. It's hard to believe that the villains were as bad as she made them out to be. There is good and evil in all of us, but these folks were 100% evil. If that were true in real life, they would have been bumped off long ago. (I'm especially referring to the female villains.) The characters were exaggerated, and the ending was predictable. Give me Mary Higgins Clark any time!"
4,Fun Mystery/Romance Novel,"This is a very entertaining and enjoyable, easy read. The suspense is well set up, and the characters are intelligently drawn. The story revolves around a family in the wine business, and three generations of women are the main protagonists (all very likeable). As with all Nora Roberts novels, the setting is described fabulously.The women are strong characters, and the author doesn't fall into the usual trap of women being rescued by men (which I appreciate).My only complaint is the tidy ending, in which the mystery is solved and explained to the degree of a Nancy Drew book."
5,Fantastic Summer Read!!!,"Nora Roberts out does herself this time with an entertaining, fast pasted mystery and a fun romance between two interesting characters. The book kept me interested and I would highly recommend it to others. ONe of her best."
4,A great source for escapist reading,"Nora Roberts is weaves wonderful tales and while The Villa may not be her best, I wouldn't say it was her worst either. While there were a couple of instances where something surprised me, overall after reading multiple novels by her, that she seemed to have fallen into a bit of a rut with her characters. When I read Tyler, I could easily see some of her others heros, such as the lead from Carolina Moon, in the lines. While that's not necessarily a bad thing for me as I liked both characters, I would love to see some of the earlier variety she displayed. I don't mean to say that Tyler is a carbon copy of the earlier character, but they seemed to have quite a bit in common. Roberts is capable of wonderful stories, and while I firmly believe this book bears a place on the shelf of any Roberts fan, it has room for improvement. Nevertheless, it serves the purpose of most romance novels, great escapist reading :)"
3,Down the line reading,"Certainly not her best book to date, The Villa has all the ingredients for a good book, yet after mixing a likeable tale of the Italian and Californian vineyards and the family who cultivates them, it wraps up in a nose dive, slightly unbelievable twist that has the reader saying, ""Huh?"" A definite read to Roberts fans, though I reccommend buying it used or renting from the library. Simply not worth keeping around for a second read."
5,Very very good,I really liked this one because of the characters... and of course the background being about wine.. and the lifestyle of those who create it :) I definitely recommend this one.
2,"You can't win them all, Nora!","Let me start by saying that I am a huge Nora fan. I believe I've read just about everyone of her books and have loved them. Unfortunately, not this time. The Villa's main charecters left me cold. Sophie and Ty were just a little too self-absorbed for my taste. David and Pilar were much more interesting. Too bad there wasn't more of them. There were too many characters. The ending was awful. Nothing like lying your whole life and taking the law into your own hands and getting away with it! Puh-leese! Better luck next time, Nora!"
3,Great little story...,"I just started listening to electronic books, so I did not know what to expect. The only complaint I had was the narrator... it took me a little while to like just one person speaking for all characters. Nice story line and it must have been good, because it is difficult to keep me wanting more when it comes to reading. If it does not catch me quickly, I lose interest. I give it 3 stars!!"
1,Definitely not up to her usual standard....,"I've always enjoyed her books, and look forward to new ones, but this one is a disappointment. It's crammed with characters and plots that don't meld into a gripping story, or hold onto the reader's interest. The central characters were not particularly sympathetic, and I didn't really care how the book ended. I gave this book away without finishing it - a first, for me, with a Nora Roberts book."
1,What a piece of junk. No help at all,"As other have noted, this this should be called an interruptable power supply. Certain voltage dips cause it to freak out and drop power long enough to reset some equipment before the battery kicks in.That's bad enough.Then, it stopped working all together. I have no idea why. I when I plug it in and turn it on the voltage readout swings from 118 to zero and back and the relay clicks.I have had it too long to return so I guess I need to buy a new UPS. I guess I will try a different brand."
3,I've got my money's worth...,"This UPS is great. Heavy, but versatile. Fan noise seems to have increased lately, but I may just need to dust it!Update: It crapped out on me. Completely dead. Tripp Lite did eventually replace it, but it took them 3 weeks, and cost me about $35 to ship the defective one back."
3,Noisy fan runs 100% of the time.,"Just bought my SMART1500LCD yesterday and it's going back tomorrow. The cooling fans run 100% of the time, even with no load connected whatsoever. If you're in a noisy dust-free environment, I guess this wouldn't be a problem. But in a home office, forget it (for me).I won't rate lower than 3 stars since the unit probably performs OK, but I didn't get that far."
4,So far so good,I have put 22 of these units in. All have had no issues. None DOA all have been in use for over 6 months. No issues. I'll report back when they are over the 1 year mark.I wish the software had more features.I wish the software was better to look at.In other news I have an APC 3000 that has been going strong for 6 years with no issues and no battery replacement needed.
2,Service costs? Ouch.,"I got about two and a half years of decent service out my SMART1500LCD. But if it goes south, as mine did today (shut off intermittently, failed self-test by shutting down because the battery was on its last legs), here's what you can look forward to:Tripp-Lite's support line isn't toll-free. Their support staff, however, was friendly and courteous. Unfortunately, I was informed that a unit in warranty must be returned to them for service; no local service can be obtained. You are required to pay transportation costs both ways. Given that the unit is rather heavy, this alone could be quite expensive. Unfortunately for me, my unit was out of warranty, and so the offer I received was a replacement for $191.00, along with the aforementioned transport costs. Prohibitive, to say the least.I opted instead to purchase an APC BR1500LCD locally, for which I've read great reviews here. Its user-replaceable battery may be a boon later on."
1,VERY BAD,If it wasnt for me being in Iraq and unable to send this back I would return this product in a heart beat. The battery does not charge and the ditital light turns on and off by its self. This was not worth buying at all I do not recommend or refer this to anyone.
2,Don't bet your life on this.,"Based on countless other reviews of this crapping out after a year or two, I'm not optimistic of how this will work in the long term. I've purchased three of these from various retailers, two of those have been dead on arrival. Not looking at good odds here... Good price though, but if this is going into a critical environment, look elsewhere. If I ever go on life support, I hope it's not made by Tripp Lite."
1,Avoid this Product,"I purchsed 2 of the 1500 VA 120V ""Smartpro"" UPSes from Tripp Lite via their web site. Both units failed within 3-4 months during moderate use in a home theater/ audio setup. The company (Tripp Lite) was very un-cooperative in making an adjustment - I argued both units were defective. They disagreed. One issue with the Tripp Lite units is they are shipped with the batteries already hooked up - like everything else they are made in China and most sit on the shelf for a long time before being sold. When they go into service the batteries are already depleted and beyond recharge.Ultimately I threw both Tripp Lite units in the trash and replaced them with APC 1300 VA UPS systems - which actually perform better and were less money to start with - if only I would have known. Too bad I wasted over $500 on Tripp-Lite products. Avoid this company and its bad products !!!!!!"
2,Disappointing,I was very disappointed with this video as it had been advertised as having dancing from the American Bandstand show(s) and I was looking forward to showing my students dance steps from the '50's. The ONLY dancing on the show (other than Chubby Checker) was under the credits at the end and showed people only from the waist up!! Useless for my purposes :(
5,Must have for Hardi-Plank siding,"Title says it all. Great blades. These things slice through fiber cement siding like a hot knife through butter. VERY low dust too. Long life on blade--I did a three car garage and attached 170 sq ft mudroom on one blade with no real noticeable dulling of blade. If you were siding a whole house or larger addition, you'd probably need two blades though."
5,Wonderful Blade,"Before purchasing this blade I was using a circular saw with a fiber cutting blade. It worked ok, but it was a challenge to make a straight cut and making small pieces, around a window for example was not going to work well at all. With this blade on my mitre saw I have no problems. Makes a nice cut and allow for minor trimming. This blade it not cheap, but worth it. I expect it to last a DIY'er a long time."
4,Good tools for the do it yourselfer,Great products! I would definitly reccommmed these for easy one man/women installation. Siding gauges are definitly worth the cost.
5,"Fantastic Guide, Full of Infor!!!","This is a awesome guide... It lists out every single detail you need to know to complete the game. Gives you scenarios and advice of what is the best possible way to beat your foes....You will get the chance to witness and learn about your enemies thru this guide....If you are having a tough time not knowing which weapons to used, then this is the guide for you. All the strategic strategy outlaid in this guide will help you navigate and play thru your game with ease but of course even though the guides tells you what to do, it doesn't mean you will complete the game with flying colors. The controller is in your hand so you are the player, decide which best walk thru to get your thru easily. Brady games' guide are always very detailed and easily understood. This guide will definitely help you in your quest for world peace in RE4!!!"
3,This guide vs. Gamefaqs free contents,"Why would you shell out a dozen big ones to get a walkthrough while you can get two dozen walkthroughs for free plus lots of detailed guides for free on Gamefaqs.com? Two reasons: 1. This guide is much better written and edited than the poor-English ones you find on Gamefaqs, 2. this guide includes maps and other goodies. If you are a true RE4 fan this is an indispensable companion to getting the most -- like 100% -- out of your RE4 game. If you just want to play RE4 once through, then one of the free walkthroughs from Gamefaqs should suffice."
4,Helps a lot,this thing is very helpful. it tells you what the tresures are and wher they are. and shows you everything else! Stuck on RE4? then buy this guide. and it comes with a tight poster!
5,A well done game for any vintage resident evil fans,"Well first, let me put it lightly. I LOVEEEE this game!! Resident Evil Outbreak is the way classic Resident Evil multiplayer should be played. Not saying that 5's mercenaries wasn't a blast or anything. Its just survival horror meant something alittle different back in the day. Back when the games really drove into that primal fear of being afraid of what we can't always see. Also the games balance of horror and problem solving is among some of the best in the gaming world, past or present. The only negative things I have to say about it is the sometime crazy long load times and the shortness of the 5 missions. With these in consideration I still choose the rate this game and guide 5 out of 5"
4,"too many spoilers; not enough ""walkthrough""","I've relied on really good Guides by Birlew, and this one is good-but in this case it seems like he took the day off; thinking perhaps the 'wow' of the game would forgive. He is usually careful not to spoil any scares or plot points and walk you through tough battles. In this one he would say something more like "" Around the next corner a zombie waits to surprise ambush you, you can escape his attack like so....then you will be attacked by a series of 3 waves of zombies totaling 14, but don't enter the tower or the house across the street or there will be 18, one with a chainsaw-fight them your own way."" He could/should have offered alot more strategy without giving away so many of the games key 'jump out of your seat' moments. I'm a little diappointed. Otherwise, it's up to snuff if you want a good walkthrough. If you're just stuck on one thing and don't plan on replaying the game or finding eveything-look online."
5,brackman/america's printed fabric 1770-1890,"what a wonderful resource book for anyone who is interested in fabric/fiber arts.i'm a quilter who likes to create quilts with a flair from yesterday. this book not only helps me to be closed in my interpretation of that time, it does guide me through the decision which colors have been more used than others. the contents/pictures are very clear and the instructions to recreate some of the quilts are outstanding. i would give this book 6 stars!"
4,America's Printed Fabrics 1770-1890: 8 Reproduction Quilt Projects: Historic Notes and Photographs; Dating Your Quilts,This is a good resource for the history of textiles with the purpose of dating quilts or construction of period correct clothing and quilts.
5,A Must read for any serious spiritual journeyman,"There is not much I can say that will suffice...if you are a practitioner of Tantric-Buddhism (and irrelevant factor in regards to the truths presented in this book), or just a seeker after Ontognosis in general, this book is a must have for your collection.It's as though you have been graced by being allowed to sit and listen in on the discussion of an enlightened master and his chief disciple, expounding the truth, through the explanation of Naropa's story...that suffering will never truly be avoided until the reality of suffering is embraced as the path to liberation itself.You are asked to re-orient your thinking so as to understand the allegories of Naropa's trials toward enlightenment not merely to understand the story, but to take you on your own journey toward your only cognitive reflection, and facing your own suffering AS your own path to liberation...Every page opens the eye..."
1,Look Out,This book is fictional and made up. If you believe the stories you must be gullable. How can you teach something that you do not really believe or live. He talks about the indians but he does not truly emboby their general spirit or their cultural beliefs. Many great indians have taught basic natural spiritual principles. Many say that the white indians are the ones that turn their principles around and use them only to make them money.
3,not bad,"His other book ""Bring on the empty horses"" was a much better reading. The Moon's a Balloon had a few of the same passages in it as ""Bring on the empty horses"". It was just ok. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't read the other first."
3,An amusing life,"A revisit from Niven's oldie but goodie.Follows the life of a Englishman wanting to make good in America in whatever way he could.Begged, borrowed and stole from the stars of Hollywood to attain his goals.A very amusing read, from his first encounter with the fairer sex to wartime experiences, Niven shows just how resourceful the actors of the early 30s and 40s had to be to make it in America."
2,"Buy, if your last name's Niven; avoid otherwise","If i were one of Niven's offspring, i would definitely find much interest in this autobiography. Seeing as i'm not, i've found it boring to no end. It was recommended me by one Amazon reviewer as a ""very funny read."" It is everything but. To be honest, i only read the first few chapters. I didn't feel compulsion to go any further.Trying to come up with some good points, the following two finally presented themselves. In the middle of the book is to be found a picture of Niven flanked by two of his sons, the elder of whom is a most presentable, semi-nude young man, whose appealing aspect roused my spirit a bit from the apathetic lethargy it had succumb to in the course of reading the first few chapters. Also, the index looks quite comprehensive."
3,You get what you pay for,"I really liked this backpack when I first got it, but after a couple months the zipper broke. I probably over-filled it too many times, and I guess the zipper wasn't strong enough to handle that."
4,travel bag,"this bag provides all i need in a small travel bag.it holds my laptop,water and small items.the straps are comfortable and one can use it over one shoulder or two."
4,Great bag!,"I got the bag in Smoke, and LOVE it! I wanted a bag that was neutral, unisex and could be worn with anything, and this bag is it! But like someone else said, it is difficult to close and I wouldn't reccomend wearing it in a place where you could easily be pick-pocketed cause someone could reach in it. The zipper on the front of it is of good quality and the front pouch is deep so I would reccommend putting valuables in there, or in the main compartment if you have a small sweatshirt stuffed overtop of it. It's perfect for travel cause it can be folded down and fit in any suitcase, but again when traveling be ware of the closing. I got the bag in Smoke, and LOVE it!"
3,Overall Good Product,I had a sack bag that I purchased from Old Navy several years ago and loved. I loved it so much that it started falling apart and I was looking to replace it. Seeing this bag online I thought it would be a good replacement. I do like the size inside as well as the front zipper pocket. My one complaint would be that the drawstrings make it really hard to open and close the bag.
2,Inaccurate color descriptions,"Hey, I just wanted to let everyone know that the ""denim"" color is actually a sage/purple color. I'm a guy in the army who wanted this for the gym - I have to return it now."
4,Enjoyed Christmas gift,"My son was very happy to see superman under the Christmas tree this year. It was a little smaller than I thought it was going to be,but he loves playing with it. It is so hard for find anything superman that is not a collectible and being a small fortune."
4,For kids at any age who love superman,My 2 year old son Loves superman and takes this toy out with him during family time
4,good,"I bought the old version. I'm sure the new version is a little easier to read, maybe with some pictures included. The old version is very dense, but this can be good if you already know a bit about the field."
2,a beauty mummified,convex programming is a beautiful topic which admits amazing geometric interpretation.books like this manage to destroy one's appreciation of the topic by not providing even one (gasp!) figure. damn Bourbaki style.
4,nice product,"it had frayed corners, but other than that it was in great condition. no writing, good buy. =]"
3,good but always grainy,"tasty but not the best drink. the chocolate flavor is strong but more like carob than chocolate. the powder is hard to get to dissolve by stirring, however putting it through the vita-mix gets it pretty smooth! I am happy to support a company out of sebastopol, ca and to get added nutrients in my shakes but this recipe could be tuned up to make it work out properly."
2,Damaged and expired,"The item came in a reasonable time, so I was happy about that. The package was completely damaged and falling apart, which could have been the postal services fault. The product had expired almost a month prior. The item seems like a really good one in which I hope to try and have a better experience next time."
3,Maybe not for everyone?,"I love the taste of this product. Reminds me of Nestle's Quik when I was growing up...After the third day, I had a whole day of explosive foul-smelling rotten-egg flatulence that could only be attributed to the drink I had. However, I wonder if this happened because I had added 8 oz of skim milk to the drink... usually I do not have a problem with skim milk as I have it in coffee and with cereal during the day.The rotten-egg smell, per my research, comes from sulfur-containing foods... perhaps the combination of hemp and milk creates a nondigestible mix?Please, if anyone has ideas feel free to comment."
5,Perfect energy Drink,I am a polio survivor and tuhis provide the ability to take the extra protien I need wiithout having to load my system with extra fat and sugar. Great taste too!
3,"Fine Music, Yet Not The Best Of.....","As a Suzanne Vega fan, I can say that many of her best songs are missing in this otherwise fine, diversely ordered collection. The disc runs a little over an hour in length and the songs could have been featured without sacrificing others.My advice, especially to U.S. residents who only have access to this disc as an import (aka overpriced), I'd recommend purchasing at least three of her albums (they're about ten dollars a piece; I especially recommend ""Nine Objects Of Desire"") and end up spending a similar amount rather than this selective album, that nevertheless contains quality music from the classiest, most tender and consistent voice of adult pop for almost two decades now.Since this review was written, a new Suzanne Vega recompilation has been made available in the U.S."
5,Diverse and Enjoyable,"Very catchy tunes , great lyrics . Lots of oldies in this one . Nostalgic . If you're planning to buy one Suzanne vega CD , let it be this one ."
4,Luka and Tom's Diner are my favorites!,"First, Suzanne Vega came on the music scene with ""Luka"" about a girl who lives in an apartment building. In the song, we learn that Luka is a victim of physical abuse. Vega's lines are haunting and realistic about Luka's situation. It's not a happy song but realistic and haunting as well.My favorite is Tom's Diner where she talks about urban life in New York City. Some people might find Suzanne Vega an acquired taste. She's not exactly your typical performer. She has great songs and sings them quite well. Some people may not like her style which isn't so bad. There are some songs that I could take or leave but I like Suzanne Vega. She's a great singer and songwriter and poet."
4,Best price and Quick shipping,"I looked around at several other places and this by far was the best price to be found. As far as the spring compressor it is pretty standard, and works fine."
3,"It worked, but barely","I bought this to put the coil springs back on my 1999 s10 4.3 2wd. First I had to cut about 5 inches off the bolt so it would work with my truck. The bolt seems to be too long for any vehicle. Then the compressor kept popping off when I was trying to use it. I got it to work by only connecting the two shorter lips on the back of the spring and compressing it so it would curve just a little bit. This tool is very dangerous as well as probably any other tool that compresses springs. I gave it three stars because I had to modify it and it just wouldn't work the right way for me. If you need a spring compressor this one is of good quality, but it may have limited uses for certain vehicles. Also my spring was at the maximum size for this compressor."
3,humm...,"well if you want an LSU collar this is it. They will fad after about 6 months and after 3 or so months they will not stay in place as they will either be to tight or to loose. I have now been through at least 4 or 5 of them, and I will keep buying them till a better one comes out. GEAUX TIGERS."
4,Good phone,"I enjoy this phone very much. It is fairly easy to use and has lots of features. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it does not come with a power cord adaptor! This was something that was not advertised and was a big pain to deal with when it came in and I wanted to use it. Other than that, a great phone!"
5,Metal Strap Nailer,"This is a nice, light metal strap nailer. It's angled so it gets into most tight places. I've done three houses with it and haven't had a jam. It fires the nail each and every time with no problems. This is a real labor saver!"
3,I expected better from Hitachi,"Received this in time to use it on a small addition I'm currently building. Began to have some problems right off the bat with this gun. First off, it won't fire the last 5 nails without another strip of nails to back them up. Now this may not be Hitachi's fault, but I used the nails that Amazon advertised with the gun, and a second strip will not fit in. So you have to pull out the last few nails to proceed. Second, the safety probe slipped from the track it rides in and jammed, preventing the gun from shooting until you stop and replace the safety into position. This happened several times, slowing the process down immensely. Pretty costly considering the price of labor these days. I have to say I really expected a lot better engineering from Hitachi. They need to do some serious re-designing on this one."
4,This Is a Hoot! (Or Should I Say 'Howl'?),"As a single song, the gimmick of ""singing"" dogs is a real hoot. Don't get me wrong, I never grow tired of hearing Nat ""King"" Cole singing ""The Christmas Song"" or Bing Crosby singing ""White Christmas,"" but every once in a while you need to lighten up. I highly recommend this song as one of the great Christmas novelty songs of all time. But do not--I repeat--do NOT make the mistake of thinking more is better. The full length albums of singing dogs or cats or frogs or deranged weasels does not get funnier the more times you repeat the gag...it doesn't. Buy this single and then promise you'll stop."
3,Assignment,"I don't think I would recommend this book to the average person. If someone was curious about extinction and different theories then they might like this book. I was hoping it would be more about extinction and dinosaurs. Anyway the author did a good job explaining his thoughts on extinction. It was interesting seeing how the author kind of explained how extinction could be as simple as bad luck, a species just being in the wrong place at the wrong time. A lot of the points are expressed well and some of the information was interesting but it still wasn't my type of book."
3,"very effective, but for how long?","Works great, but the fine print on the product box says replace the earmuff pads every 6 months, as deterioration should be expected. Amazon doesn't sell the replacement pads. I hope these don't deteriorate like other headphones I've had where the vinyl cover that contacts the ear just disintegrates and other plastic parts turn gooey. The jury is still out, so only 3 stars for now."
3,Basic Headphones are ok,I bought these to block out my son and boyfriend when they play loud music on their video games. They block out some noise but not as much as I would like. They do fit ok for my head.I am going to try and find stronger ones and maybe give these to my son who is autistic and bothered by people talking to loud.
5,Saved our hearing.,"After much research we purchased 2 of these for an upcoming Gatornationals Professional drag racing event. In the past we just held our hands over our ears and it was a pain to keep covering and opening our ears. These things are awesome!! It takes away ALL of the harshness, yet leaves the fun part there. SWEEEEEEET!"
4,A good muff,"I got these earmuff a few years ago for use with a table saw. The saw is long gone, but I still use them for various things, such as while vacuuming with my Dyson and while shooting my loud pistol on the gun range. They're big enough inside to accommodate a pretty big set of stick-in type earplugs underneath. I wear all that stuff to protect my hearing, and the cavity of these muffs allows that. My GLOCK merely barks, and my ears do not ring at all after shooting. I give 'em a 4-star because, to me, they look a bit dorky; but maybe you would call it retro and give them a 5. Oh, and they're comfortable over my glasses -- don't bite my head (but, then, I don't usually wear them for hours on end, so I can't vouch for that kind of wear)."
3,i can't believe people gave this 5 stars,"these things are ""ok"" at best. they are not comfortable, they reduce some noice (i could clearly hear a light tapping on the wall w/my finger) and are too tight.. BUT.. they cost me only $12, so they get an ok rating. i wish i would of bought a better pair, but i will wear these until they break or i can't stand them... i don't know which will come first... probably the latter."
5,Excellent product!,"I am very pleased with this product. They are very comfortable, easy to adjust and offer great protection from noise. I can wear them all day. I am an occassional user, but would recommend them to anyone."
4,excellent noise reducer,"these worked great around the yard with loud machinery. kept well on the head and ears. didn't notice discomfort with use around 3-4 hours. at 30 db of reduction, that's very good for a passive earmuff. i even use it at the shooting range, and these are excellent for the price. any caliber has very low report with these. however, it must be noted that the muffs are rather thick, subsequently they do a great job. i had no issues when shooting pistols. but with my rifles, i had difficulty targeting as the muffs are so thick they impede on the stocks. i will be getting the shotgunners muff as those are low profile. thus the 4 stars, i would have given 5 if solely around the house and yard."
4,"Great product, but slightly misleading: NOT active noise canceling","This is a superior noise ""REDUCING"" or ""FILTERING"" or ""SUPPRESSING"" earmuff. Noise canceling implies active circuit with a microphone and speakers that generates sound waves opposite to the noise of certain frequency in the area. This product is completely passive.Something worth noting is that if you wear glasses (or sunglasses), this might not work as well as foam earplugs. These earmuffs works by forming a good seal around your ears, and most glasses will compromise the seal. Also, the pressure of the earmuffs on the glasses frame might cause some discomfort."
5,Great Hearing protection,I used these for cutting the grass and for shooting. I am not sure if they are intended for shooting but they worked fine.They work well with ear buds.
5,Peltor H10A Optime 105 Earmuffs,"These earmuffs are the best I could find with a 30 decibel rating. Upon arrival, I discovered they are also very comfortable because of thick and soft padding. Excellent."
4,Excellent hearing protection,"Pros:* Effective hearing protection* ComfortableCons:* A bit bulky (but then again, that's why they're so effective in blocking loud noises)* Your ears may become sweaty if this is worn for an extended period of time/on a summer day"
4,Use for shooting,Comfortable with great noise protection . CHEAP for the protection you are getting.Only negative is they are a little thick.
5,Works for our horribly loud weed whacker!!,"We have a weed whacker that is so loud that we usually keep it on second gear. We bought the little plugs that you could put into your ear canal, but that ended up being more of a problem (sweat getting trapped in the ear and not staying in). We wanted a better solution. I found these Peltor H10A noise canceling earmuffs, and figured for the price why not give them a try. These work really great, and are very comfortable. If you want a product that is cheap in price, but is so worth your hearing protection I would suggest these."
3,"Cups Your Ears Well, But Does Not Reduce All Noise","I had originally bought this product to reduce noise around me when I was study. I lived in an small apartment and there was some noise distraction. So I decided to buy these earmuffs. To give my honest opinion. These earmuffs work better if your behind closed doors and you do not want to hear things outside the door.Although I was still able to hear some sounds outside the door. The earmuff are not very comfortable, they squeeze my head a bit. I have not really used these much. If I want to study. I leave the house to go to another quiet place."
3,"Package says 30 decibels, not 105!","Received these muff today. They look just like the picture, same model etc. Very comfortable and they are adjustable. HOWEVER, the package states they are EPA rated for 30 decibels. I bought them because of the claimed 105 dBA rating.What gives????"
1,NOT noise canceling!!!,"Just a heads-up for anyone looking for noise cancellation. These are padded earmuffs that reduce noise. The same as if you wrapped a pillow around your head. There is no cancellation involved, and labeling these as a ""Noise Canceling Earmuff"" is misleading. If you are looking for actual noise canceling, look elsewhere."
5,son loves them,"My son who has issues with noise levels when at events, etc. really likes these. He will wear them as needed to keep out the loud noises ~ but can still hear normal conversations."
5,I prefer these over Leightning L3,"I have been using these and the Leightning L3 earmuffs for almost a year, mostly for shooting. I prefer these over the L3s. Even though the Peltors are rated at 29 and the L3s are 30, these have softer pads and seal better over eye protection. The difference in noise reduction between the two is not huge, but noticeable. And these are more comfortable. Both are fine, but I recommend these over the L3s if you are considering both. Either way, if the noise levels are very high I recommend using foam earplugs in addition, just to further protect your hearing."
2,Cuts down on noise but conversations still come through clearly,I work in an office and I bought when there was construction in the adjacent lot- they where pounding supports into the ground. It didn't eliminate the noise but made it more bearable. It did the same for office conversation. We have a loud talker in the group. I can still make out every word but it makes things better.They are a good deal for the price but don't eliminate noise.
2,Far too big!,"I know that plastic earmuffs are big, but WOW! these practically double the width of my head! I originally bought them because I wanted to wear them on the subway over my ear buds, so that way I wouldn't hear the subway noise and wouldn't need to turn my music volume up as loud. Nope. Not only did I look absolutely rediculous wearing these, I could still hear a lot of things on the subway. Yes everything was much duller to hear, but the fact that for the size, they couldn't block out even conversations being had near me makes this not worth the money. Now they're hanging up in storage. However I'm sure they'll work just fine for a more practical use, such as protecting your ears on a construction site."
5,Reduce noise in the office,"I got these to help reduce the noise from the office. I can barely hear people talking, but can't understand what they are saying, so that helps out greatly.I can't wear them for very a long time without discomfort, but long enough to let me focus on a particular task, when I really need to."
3,Peltor Hearing Protector,"Adequately fulfills its purpose of blocking loud engine noises. I wear it over earbuds while listening to mp3's on my cell phone. Seems a little tight, not easy to adjust."
1,Don't be deceived,"The product description is total deception. Noise cancellation requires an electronic or mechanical negative feedback system, which these earmuffs do not have. These are nothing more than noise reducing ear muffs."
1,"Rating the shipment, not the actual product.. FAIL!","Honestly, I don't know jack about hearing protectors, so I'm not going to say whether this is a good product or not, HOWEVER, what I do know is that they did a horrible job of insuring it arrived safely. This product was shipped to me in the original flimsy box and nothing else. The box was not placed inside a sturdy shipping box, nor was there any bubble wrap, packing peanuts, styrofoam, or any other protective packaging to minimalize the possiblity of recieving a broken product. The box I received was torn and in terrible shape. I sent it right back to them just the way it was sent to me. The postman looked at me funny.. Like I care."
1,borken package and uncomfortable earmuff,"When I received this package, the prodct is broken and dirty, and it looks like a used product.The earmuff is too tight to wear for a long time."
1,this is scary,i was going to buy it but it says:California Proposition 65Attention California Residents:California's Proposition 65 entitles California consumers to special warnings for products that contain chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm if those products expose consumers to such chemicals above certain threshold levels. We care about our customers' safety and hope that the information below helps with your buying decisions.The general Proposition 65 notice is as follows:WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.
5,"Angels sing when I put them on my big head, but I can't hear them","A seemingly minor feature of these earmuffs is the metal coupling between the cups. It adjust to the size of my head, which goes something like 24""+ around. I have tried to use ones with plastic couplings before, and I have a tendency to break them. First, if you leave them out over time, UV degrades them, and then they crack when I put them on my giant head. These earmuffs have not had this problem."
5,"Bulky, but inexpensive, most effective, and comfortable","I bought a pair at Sears during a close out sale. Might have paid $24. These are bulky, but are most effective and most comfortable. The paddings are nice and soft, and contours nicely to the shape of your head, even if you wear glasses. I sometimes fall asleep with these on. I wear them when I study on the NYC subway and buses. People may stair, but who cares. With over 8 million people in NYC, they're not going to remember me over the people with the acid dyed nuclear hair...besides, I don't need to listen to the jerks screaming on their cell phones. Why bother spending $100+ for battery powered noise cancellation devices, when all you need are ear buds and these earmuffs. You won't even need to buy any batteries for this. You get use to listening to the sound of your pulse while wearing this. This is technically not a noise canceling devise, but does a great job at absorbing or blocking out sound. Mine was rated at about 82 decibel."
4,Silence.....,"Feels tight around the ears, but works good, just can't sleep with these on ,just too uncomfortable after a while."
5,Very good hearing protection at a reasonable price,"I use these while operating power tools and equipment around my home. The ear cups fit well and form a tight seal without excessive clamping pressure. The adjustable headband is easy to adjust and holds its position. If I'm going to operate the tools/equipment for longer than 15 minutes, I will also use a pair of disposable foam ear plugs to double the noise reduction.The ear cups are large enough that it is not practical to hang these around your neck. I also suspect they might interfere with shooting a rifle but have no experience in this. More importantly for me, they are comfortable and completely cover my rather large ears. They are perfect for my application around the home."
4,Blocks out most noise,"I bought these earmuffs to use when I was studying for a state licensing exam. I live in a very noisy neighborhood, and most of the noise was blocked effectively. Small noises, like a faucet dripping or clock ticking, were completely blocked out. Other noise, like an ice cream truck, helicopter, loud music played from a car, wasn't blocked out completely, but definitely toned down.I was able to get used to wearing them while laying down and even sleeping, but I don't think they were made for that purpose!"
4,Silence is Golden,I have to work in a noisy environment for a while and these did the job.Much easier to thing without all that machinery noise. Very good.
5,One of the Best purchases I ever made ! Very Effective,"I have found these headphones to be very effective in many situations, especially when researching in Libraries."
5,Excellent Noise Attenuation; High Quality Product,"I purchased this earmuff to protect my hearing when operating my lawn mower (in the past, I had used one of my aviation headsets, but felt this was not a good use for such a vital cockpit tool).The Peltor earmuff is very effective attenuating mechanical noise from my lawn mower, my leaf blower, and my snow blower, it is well made and, while it exerts a firm grip on your ears, it is not uncomfortable to wear.This product is well made; I highly recommend it for anybody who works in the yard with noisy power equipment"
5,Top notch product.,"Peltor has done it again with these muffs .. i actually use these to work near extremely loud rackmount server computers which sound like jet engines until i put these muffs on and then .. SILENCE! I love these things to death and they are soooo comfortable.. there is no stress on my ears or head wearing these, it just feels all balanced equally which is an important factor when needing to wear muffs for extended periods of time. Oh, and they are made in Sweden. Thank you Peltor!"
4,Great Ear Protection,Using these on a gun range to replace in ear buds. Much more comfortable and without the chance of packing in loose ear wax and going deaf for a few days.
5,Great product!,The delivery of this product was done in a timely manner. I bought this product as a gift for my son who works in a shop where the noise can get very intense. He is pleased with the weight of this product as well as the ability of the product to keep out the loud sounds created by others in the shop as well as the sounds coming from his work with equipment. It really does the job that it promises!
5,hearing protection,"Product arrived timely and works well. It will get maximum use in the woodshop, when using the snow blower and next spring, the lawn mower. Makes quite a difference."
4,Muffles sound well,Muffles household sounds well. I use to study while my 2 year old screams her head off (as long as someone else is watching her of course!). I haven't used in high dB environments so cannot comment on that. I tend to stay super focused when used around the house though.
3,Effective but not comfortable at all,Very effective at reducing sound levels. However it feels much too tight for me and I can only wear it for a few minutes.
4,What did you say???,"I use these for lawn duty-everything from lawn mowing, chain saws and weed trimmers. Best noise reduction I have used so far. They are tight fitting. Ear muff part is sturdy although frame and attachments could use a little better construction. The real test will see how long they last with more usage."
5,Good hearing protectors...,"Probably will order another pair this pay day. The only thing I dislike is the soft cushions appear to be glued to the hard shell. On all my other ear defenders the soft, and not so soft, cushions come off for cleaning. But maybe these will not need that much cleaning, I do like them..."
5,"Works well, great value.","Little heavy compared to other designs, but works well. Fits well, even with my big ears."
4,Not quite what I was expecting.,"For some reason, I was expecting this to be an electronic noise canceling head set. It turns out to be just a standard foam insulated head set. It is very good at blocking out noise..... much better than my standard set that I have been using for years. It drops the garden tractor noise down to a very quiet hum in the background. If you concentrate you can hear your own pulse.Very comfortable. I wore it for two hours with no discomfort."
4,"They work great, but they're HUGE","If you're going to be doing work with loud equipment, these are great. They block out a lot of sound. But, they are much bigger on your head than they look in the picture, so you do look a little silly wearing them.At first, they were too tight on my head, but I put them on a cardboard box for a few days to strech them out, and now I can wear them for hours without discomfort. I'm usually quite senstive to having my head squished by headphones, so I'm glad that they stretched out eventually.They can also be combined with earbuds for very isolated music listening. I do that when using loud equipment. Just don't turn the music up too load, or you won't here anything outside at all, which could be unsafe."
4,Peltor Professional Noise Canceling Earmuff #H10A,Blocks the sound good and is comforatable with earbuds underneath it. Only wish the head support swilved so that you can put on/off a cap when wearing them.
4,Nice product,"Works as promised and very comfortable. The only complaint that I would have are the small medal adjusts, looks like wire hangers, wish it was something that didn't look like it would stab you."
3,Works for high pitch noises - stuffs my brain,they fit snug and really cancle out high pinch noises but because they are so vaccumed onto the ears you kinda feel like your brain can't breath or ventalate kinda makes you dizzy.
5,great protection great price,These ear muffs showed up pretty quickly for my location in afghanistan and they work very well. the headband/spring has a lot of tension and allows me to walk right up to a running bird w/out losing muffs or hat underneath
5,Works the best of anything I've tried,"I've had hearing loss & tinnitus since the 70's (Army vet). I've tried hard to protect what I've got left & prevent spells of increased tinnitus (ringing in the ears) caused by loud noise exposure. These earmuffs are light, comfortable and REALLY bring down the noise level! You can hear someone talking to you, but just enough to know you need to take off the muffs to carry on a decent conversation ;-}"
4,Good quality for the price,I bought these for the shooting range and find them to work nicely and am overall happy with them. The price was very good as well.
4,"Great protection, but bulky","I am really happy with this product, but wish hearing protection could be more comfortable in the heat. These do a great job of filtering out unwanted noise and I wear them mostly when using outdoor equipment such as riding lawnmowers, weedeaters, and chainsaws. Of all I have worn, I would purchase these again."
4,Adequate sound attenuation at indoor shooting range,I use them at an indoor shooting range that allows mid-sized rifles. They attenuate the sound well even from adjacent booths. Very comfortable for handgun shooting. A little bulky when shooting rifles with stock tucked at chin.
4,Good quality for the price,"I sometimes have to go out to a noisy producion floor. They work great, they're very comfortable, they cost less than $29, and I put them together myself in about five minutes, which is very satisfying. Can't beat it.I needed headphones that would block outside sound. Noise-canceling phones were much too expensive, so I decided to try making my own. First I bought a pair of Peltor H10A earmuffs. Then I took a pair of headphones that came with a portable CD player, pulled off the earpieces, and inserted them into the earmuffs."
4,its like my neighbor's dog doesnt exist....,"while these are great noise cancellers, i wouldnt buy them if youre looking for something to wear while relaxing/sleeping. They might be comfortable enough for work but not so much for laying about and DEFINITELY not for sleeping, they are too bulky and basically restrict any head movement while laying down"
2,Very Small,"These work to block out sound, but they're incredible uncomfortable to wear. I suppose for a small man, a woman, or a child, they may work, but a normal adult male, say anything around 6 feet or bigger, I'd stay away. They barely clear the crown of my head, and end up crushing my normal sized ears. Making them uncomfortable to wear for long periods, which kinda defeats the point.The ear pieces need to be about half an inch bigger, and the top strap needs to be adjustible. Cheap headphones from a 1980s walkman had adjustable straps, this doesn't?"
4,Earmuffs for NASCAR races,They really work. I was looking for earmuffs for NASCAR races.Only question is quality of Black plastic strap on headband. Heat bonded withsharp edges.
5,They are great!,I will purchase more of these they really block alot of noise. My crew is very happy with this product.
4,Work well. Nice fit.,"Good fit and they muffle a great deal of lawnmower noise. I like to listen to music as I'm mowing, and adding these earmuffs over my earbuds allows me to keep the music volume down, but I can still hear enough to be safe. Good purchase."
2,Head Squeezer!!,"I could tell that they would be great in the range, yet I never made it with them. As soon as I wore them around the house to get adjusted to them; I came down with a headache and nauseous feeling. It squeezed my head so much that it would be unsafe for me to use at a shooting range. I returned them since they would not be useful to me. Not to mention, they are huge! I am looking for an alternative earmuff, so right now I will be sticking with my Radians Remington earmuffsRadians Remington Womens Eye and Ear Protection Combo Packsince they are at least more comfortable wearing at the range."
3,Not Adjustable,"These ear muffs are not adjustable and barely fit. I am 5'10"" tall and weigh 185 # so I don't think I have a large head. I have to tilt them back a bit to ensure my ears are completely covered. They do work well but are not comfortable."
4,Not noise cancelling - noise reducing. Amazon has mislabeled this product.,"That is not just a symantic difference. Noise cancelling implies active circuitry to detect specific frequencies and emit an inverse signal to counteract them. These are not even labeled as noise cancelling on the box but as noise reducing. That means that the noise reduction is completely passive. Amazon has mislabeled this product and it was not what I expected. They are, however, very good noise reducing earmuffs. A bit bulky, though."
4,Good for the money!,"Kind of bulky for running around behind the mower, but not bad. Comfy, can wear for long periods of time, pretty good noise protection. Very hot, but that's to be expected. NOTE these are not noise canceling!! Noise canceling implies a different type of technology that is not used with these earmuffs."
5,Great ear protection for the gun range,"These hearing protection ear muffs are fantastic for shooting at the range. They are comfortable, adjustable, sturdy and most important EFFECTIVE! For the price they are beyond worth it. The photo honestly does them no justice. I was worried they were going to be cheaply made but they are not. They are very nice and I doubt anyone would find an issue with them. If you are looking for a good set of ears for shooting I would say you found them here."
3,"Good, but not for indoors shooting","I bought these to use at my local indoor range as some reviewers said they were good for this purpose. After all, they have one of the highest NRR available. However, when I tried them at the gun range, they didn't perform as expected. I even added double protection (ear plugs) but it was not enough, my ears were ringing after the session. Perhaps I'm too sensitive to loud noises and that's why they didn't do the trick for me. I was looking for something good at a reasonable price, but I guess I will have to spend more money if I really want to protect my hearing."
4,Ear protection/noise reduction,"Much better than those you buy off the shelf. Effective in cutting out machinery (trimmers/lathe) noise, not so selective on speech. but at least metallic strap will not break that easily (<6 months, so far holding up). You do get some sweat from the cushion around the ears though."
4,Studying Necessity,"These do help reducing noise while studying. However, do not expect complete silence. They are a studying necessity of mine, since my family speaks loudly and watches tv on almost the highest volume setting. You can hear your heart beat with these. I like them and will probably buy my cousin a pair for her college freshman year."
4,"Great, especially for the price","They work great, and are comfortable. I use my to double as noise canceling headphones - simply break off the earpieces from your old Walkman headphones, slip the earpiece sideways into the Peltor earmuffs, push it all the way back into the foam, and adjust the earpiece so it sits nicely in the back. You will be surprised how well they work for airplanes, lawn mowing, or any other situation where noise can impact your music. Plus, they're about $100-200 cheaper than the real ones you find from Bose and others."
5,Hearing protection,"Peltor H10A arrived in a most timely fashion, and was exactly as described. They were adjustable to fit very comfortable. My Ryobi string trimmer is very loud, and the Peltor Noise Cancelling Muffs provide more than ample protection. Great product, and highly reccommended."
5,Great performance and comfort for a good price.,"The protection offered is amazing, you really don't understand how much they block out until you try them. The pads are so soft that you barely feel them when you are wearing them."
4,Very satisfied,I was well pleased with these earmuffs. I use them while using a leaf blower and a chain saw and they blocked the loudness very well. They are very light weight and comfortable.
2,not useful for filtering out human voices,"I bought this product because I sometimes want to concentrate on my work in the lab but there are other people chatting loud. However I found this earmuff not an idea product for this purpose. I guess it works to filter out most of the high frequency noises (background noises from cars, machines and other things) but didn't do well in the range of human talking--it only decreases the volumn. Effectively this is making the human voice even more obvious since now the background sound is lowered. It may still be good if you want to filter out machine noise in working conditions, which I didn't test."
5,Best ear protection for the price. Very quite on range.,"I love these. Great for the range. I like my ears. I like my hearing. I feel that these protect my hearing more than adequately when I'm on the range. I like the strip of red because I'm a chick and care about those things. Sorry, just being honest. They're very comfortable. Oh, and I also use them when my 4 year old son is experimenting on his drums. A must have."
5,Excellent ear protection,"Great fit. Excellent noise suppression. Great price. Can't ask for more. I use this for mowing, felling trees with chainsaw, edging, hedging, etc."
4,Good-,This was bought so that my son could use the leaf blower without the damaging noise to his ears. He said it works well and is very comfortable to wear.
2,"too tight for an adult, not enough noise filter","This does not easily adjust to an adult size head, maybe you could wrestle it into something that feels comfortable but I didn't want to bend it out of shape. The earmuff itself is too small for my ear or something, not comfortable. I was disappointed in the quality of sound filter. I can clearly hear everything people are saying to me in low/normal voices with only a slight muffle - almost could hold my hand over my ears for the same effect. My husbands head is even bigger than mine, not even gonna try that. Returned them all. Price was good and shipping was good too. Too bad."
5,"affordable, high-quality ear protection","after going thru several cheapie sets of earmuffs from Lowes or Walmart, these are keepers! Very comfortable, and offer great sound insulation for chain-saw, leaf-blower, or lawn mower. I'll never buy the crappy plastic type again! shouldn't have to - these have nice metal bands supporting them and will last years and years I expect."
3,Extremely uncomfortable,"I have a small Woodworking shop and decided it was time to protect my hearing against the loud noise of the machines. These block the sounds very well but can only be worn intermittently because they are extremely tight.They are not adjustable so if you have a normal or large sized head, or more importantly, you wear glasses, then look elsewhere as you will not be able to wear these for extended periods. The muffs fit your head so tightly that if you wear glasses, your ears and frames will be pushed up against your head so hard that it eventually becomes painful."
4,Work great and are comfortable,I bought two of these so I could hang one by my table saw and one by my lathe. That way I'm not always across the room from them. These are more comfortable then my previous pair. With my 1 1/2hp dust collector running right next to me and the router table going I can really tell the db reduction. I'd buy these again.
5,Best hearing protection yet,I have used the Peltor brand hearing protection products for many years. I found these comfortable and very effective against blocking all damaging noise in my woodworking shop. The soft cushion outer ring was effective in allowing me to wear eye protection with no loss of protection.
4,very good,Purchased the noise cancelling earmuff for use with a professional grade back pack blower. They work well and are very confortable. I would recommend to anyone that uses noisy landscape equipment or power tools. They are very reasonably priced as well.
4,Not as quiet as expected,"WARNING: read the other reviews...this item may not be what you are looking for.I work in a lab where there is distribution, vibration, and impact testing of pallets filled with product of who-knows-what. Its constant noise and I thought these would do me well.First off, these would be given 3 stars for effectiveness...but I am very sensitive to ear phones and buds - typically they cause pain after a few hours. But these...I can wear all day! Very comfy.But...as for effectiveness...let me tell you what they can mute out: keyboard typing. Thats about it. They remove noise to a safe level (that i am assured of) but if you want complete silence, these are not for you.On low level, I can still make out the lyrics on mp3s through my computer speakers.These receive 5 stars for comfort, and 3 stars for being quiet. So...I give them 4."
5,Superior product,Great for blocking annoying harmonic vibration of heavy mower deck. The double-wall construction probablymakes a big difference along with foam padding. Best I've used!
2,Very impractical,"You can't tell from the photos because there's no other object to give perspective, but these things are HUGE. Especially in the width of the ear cups. I mean, these things extending out more than you would ever imagine. It draws attention as if you have antlers. But even if I wasn't concerned about appearance, I would not wear them because they are so width that they become a safety hazard by catching on nearby objects. Also heavier than I would like. I can't see these being practical in any situation. Get the yellow ones instead."
5,Silent comfort,These earmuffs are comfortable to wear and have very effective noise suppression. I bought two additional earmuffs after my experience with the first.
4,Great protection,A little tight around the ears if you plan to wear a beanie underneath but great ear protection. Great buy
4,Saving my hearing,"These earmuffs are doing a great job of keeping me from losing my hearing after putting a few down range. They also fit well , very comfortable. Good buy"
4,Good hearing protection,"I bought the earmuffs for hearing protection while mowing. Before I had been using the foam earplugs, and they helped, but not enough. After using the earmuffs (with the foam earplugs), I could tell a huge difference.The only downside is that after wearing for an extended length of time, is gets a little uncomfortable (probably the reason they worked so well). For the money, well worth the price."
5,Great protection,"These do a great job of protecting my hearing while using power equipment (blower, chain saw, etc.) I've had them for a year with no deterioration. I find them to be very comfortable, even when wearing goggles. They are certainly worth the price and were a big improvement over my previous set."
4,"Excellent Protection, but a bit bulky","Pros: The noise cancellation is excellent. Yesterday I shot .45, .40, .357 magnum and my 12 gauge shotgun, and the noise was dramatically reduced. Additionally, I had little difficulty engaging in conversations with my shooting partner/s. Since ear/sound protection was/is my number one goal, these earmuff's are awesome.Cons: While the Peltor H10A is constructed very well, I did find them to be a bit bulky when shooting my shotgun (and presumably, a rifle). This, however, may be the case with any earmuff, since I normally shoot with ear plugs. Therefore, the ""bulkiness"" of the earmuff when shooting shotgun/rifle may not be exclusive to this particular model (or brand) , but it may in fact be the case with all earmuffs.Despite the Peltor H10A's being a bit cumbersome in the aforementioned situation, I would unequivocally purchase these earmuffs again, and would recommend them to others.Best regards, and happy (and safe!) shooting."
5,Outstanding Product. Brilliant Idea,"This particular product, the Peltor 10A Noise Canceling Earmuff is the best around. I have needed something to help me concentrate at work -- and at home when I work in my office -- and even reading the newspaper -- and I use this all the time. At the office, I work in a semi-enclosed area (or cubicle) so clients and customers don't see me wearing these, and that works fine. In fact it works so well, I have purchased some 15 - 20 of these Peltor's for co-workers (they all reimburse me promptly) -- because this product works -- and the price is certainly very low. And management at work is happy because more work is getting done.Also, I have purchased a Peltor for the son of a good friend of mine -- as he returns to college -- to help him concentrate better in his dorm room. I'm sure it will.Thank you for your attention.Bruce Lloyd"
2,Very light fare,"This ""comedy mystery"" is superficial, politically correct, and in general barely worth one's time. Bates, with an incredible hairdo, is supposed to be a witty professor. Mostly, he's an aging actor, smirking his way through some very weak lines. Cusak, as a woman police officer, is okay, but the ""romance"" she's attempting to get into is unconvincing and terribly predictable. The film company had to depend upon glorious British scenery to keep our interest, and even there it is deficient, for we see far less of the countryside than we should. As for the mystery element, again, it's okay, if predictable. Two stars tops."
5,Sprightly mystery,"Oliver's Travels is an intelligent BBC puzzler set on the roads of Britain with lots of beautiful scenery, history, and a dash of romance. Very dense and nuanced dialog justifies repeat viewings. Sound track covers Beethovan to Miles Davis."
5,Review of Oliver's Travels,I saw this adventure one time and I have waited a long time to see it again.This is a great story with wit and beautiful scenery.I believe anyone would enjoy it.
2,high expectations,"We remember this series fondly-for its light touch of two persons who find themselves on a a journey to find themselves as they approach retirement. They kindle a spark for the relationship which is both fun and touching. However the video quality of the original production is poor-the pictures are of a quality that bespeak the VHS age (it was made in video equipment rather than film which shows it age) that we have already forgotten in the age of HIDef. That said it remains a interesting look at two people, both fine actors, with great lines, and the musical score of Old wally wally making it a landmark in our own lives."
2,Oliver's travels,"This movie is what used to be called ,'A romp'. Light hearted adventure romance involving an aging superanuated lecturer in world religions and a tough minded police woman set off on a search for a cross word compiler named Aristotle and, possibly, the villians behind an interational crime syndicate and are persued through many of the pretty parts of the UK by unidentified enemies. wonderful stuff: only the Brits can write with such a droll touch. Very Very good fun indeed."
5,Deserves a large audience,"I don't buy a lot of hardcover books--maybe two or three a year--but I met Lee Goldberg and found him so witty and charming that I had to buy his novel. I'm glad I did. I really hope some smart publisher picks up the paperback rights so that ""The Man With the Iron-On Badge"" can get the wide readership it deserves.Harvey Mapes's transition from security guard to private eye is believable; what makes this book so interesting, especially for longtime readers of PI fiction, is that everything that happens seems completely realistic. If Harvey is beat up by a bad guy, he doesn't just get up, brush himself off and go back to work. He's in pain, for a long time.""The Man With the Iron-On Badge"" made me laugh out loud several times, but it's also quite poignant. Harvey becomes a fully realized character you will find yourself rooting for. After reading this book, you'll never look at PI novels or TV shows the same way again!"
3,Doesn't live up to your best expectatioons,"The tea I just ran out of was bought while travelling to China, but the box said the material (the rose buds themselves) were from France. I was looking for French sourced rose buds on internet but found none so ordered this product. My first, visual, impression, was that the rose buds were smaller and had less vibrant coloration - some of the buds look a bit browned. My second impression was sensory - it didn't smell as strong or as good upon opening the package. Still, I soldiered on an steeped my family a pot of this new rose bud tea. Everybody had the same reaction - it didn't have as much of the delicate rose flavor and did not taste the same as the original tea we used earlier in the year. The package says ""from China"", but even though it is packaged in the same country of origin, the material used is not the top grade."
2,Pieces were missing.,My grandson was very disappointed to have a toy that didn't have all of the pieces. We went through the box several times and they weren't there. Wouldn't recommend buying it on-line. Go to the store and go through the box.
5,Survey of the Bible,Stephen Travis is a gifted writer. He understands the critical and scholarly issues of the Bible and he deals with them clearly but does not get caught up in the details of the debate. He offers insightful applications to the text that will provoke the typical conservative evangelical christian. His comments are also very edifying as he highlights the great themes of the Christian Faith. A wonderful daily devotional or small group study guide. Worth re-reading each year.
3,In some ways better ... some ways worse,First off original singer Peter Dolving is back! He doesn't sound so much like Phil Anselmo this time around. He even attempts a little unsuccessful experimenting in singing with something of a southern drawl (the awful BURNT TO A SHELL.) The Bjorlers are shrugging off their tendencies toward SLAYER riffage and giving something of a more hardcore edge (obviously with Lou Koller sharing vocal duties on WHO WILL DECIDE.) This I like. Now what the hell happened to the the shining production as best heard on THE HAUNTED MADE ME DO IT. Just listen to the dull tone of the guitars. Damn. That alone made me take a star off this review. I personally recommend the self-titled debut which is a 5 star album.
4,Who will Decide? I will this Rocks,"As most people ""All against All"" was the first song I heard off this it was good apon first listen... but it grew on me. Very, Very quickly. Now if you put the cd in for the first time you will here ""No Compromise"" and then ""99"" and if you are not hooked by that point I'm sorry you need help. This one seriously vicious album.... I liked the old singer but with orignal vocalist Peter Dolving back at the mic these guys are unstopable (I do find that his actual singing is reminiscent of Kurt Cobain) This is Pure Metal Thrash and I love it!Album Highlights: No Compromise, 99, Who will Decide, Sabotage, Liquid Burns.IF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:""Was this review helpful?"""
4,Rip roaring good!,"Wow, what a sonic assault from these cool thrashmeisters. This album for those who aren't framiliar with the band is a nice cross between prime grade 'Slayer', with a bit of 'Pantera' aggrssion tossed in for good measure. The first thing that caught my ears is how solid the drumming is. P. Jensen really puts in a performance worthy of top metal world accolades. Not only is the drumming top drawer but the drum sound is superb. Song's like '99' and 'nothing right' really deliver the riffs, and pieces such as 'Abysmal' and 'My shadow' have that 'Slayer' scariness to them. Overall there isn't really a bad track, just a few that are a little redundant. Vocally the return of P. Dolving really adds a certain dynamic to this band that Marco Aro just didn't provide. Not that his work on 'The Haunted made me do it' wasn't great, Dolving just has more feel in the voice and more versatilty that help the songs take on new life. A must have for fans of the trash metal genre."
5,Another Haunted Masterpiece,"I got The Haunted's Revolver for Christmas last year, and I thought it was one of the best new metal albums I've had the pleasure to listen to. Although Revolver is not as dark and disturbing as the band's 2003 masterpiece One Kill Wonder, but this album still delivers the goods like any other Haunted album would. This album also marks the return of original vocalist Peter Dolving who can not only let out some nasty screams, but he can also sing good. Example: Abysmal and Burnt To A Shell show Dolving's clean singing abilities. Other songs such as All Against All as well as thrash numbers Sabotage, Sweet Relief, No Compromise, 99, Smut King, Nothing Right, and Who Will Decide are very awesome for mosh pits. On this album you also got the two guitar assault of brothers Anders and Jensen Bjorler, and some real sharp guitar solos as well as the heart pounding drum work by Per Moller Jensen. Get this album now, I guarantee you'll love it. STAY METAL!"
3,Expected to be happier with results,"But I've experienced every breastfeeding problem you can have but one so perhaps I'm not the right one to judge this product. The thing I really did like about the Motherlove nipple cream was the consistency compared to the Lanolin nipple cream - much easier to apply and wash off your hand afterwards. But really, there wasn't a noticeable improvement in discomfort after using either one.(To be fair, my first lactation consultant somehow didn't catch that my baby was latching on incorrectly so I've had constant blisters, as well as other painful breastfeeding problems, and no cream can work miracles)."
1,Created sensitivity,I wanted to love this cream but didn't. During my pregnancy I vowed to go green so this was the natural choice. It ended up making my nipples extremely sensitive and painful. I ended up buying Lansinoh Lanolin and thought there was no way it would work but it works so much better for me. It truly waterproofs your nipples although it is much harder to apply. The lanolin did not give me any increased sensitivity.
5,Works and is safe for baby,Excellent soother for sore nipples and non-toxic for baby. 1 oz got me through the first month and I no longer need it.
2,Beware: Unable to use this product,"I'm very disappointed. I saw all the excellent reviews about this product and I was hoping for the best.I placed it on my nipple and the consistency was great, it was easy to apply and not as messy as the lanolin I have been using. A few seconds later my nipples started to feel very sore and kind of burn. I went to remove my cloth nipple pad and my nipple was stuck to it. I washed off the cream and instantly felt better. I suppose I had a bad reaction to something in this cream. My nipple may have stuck because I hadn't put enough of the cream on it, but the fact is it did make my nipple burn.I actually hate it and want to give it only one star but because the consistency is nice and it is less messy than the lanolin I will give it 2 stars.I just want other people to know this cream doesn't work for everyone."
1,Use lanolin instead,"This product didn't do much for me. My mom, lactation consultant, and doula all recommended using something with lanolin in it. They were so right. It made all the difference. If you are in pain - get yourself some lanolin! It works."
4,"Good product, wish better delivery system","Motherlove Herbal Nipple cream helped to sooth my sore, raw breastfeeding nipples as advertised. Although, called a ""cream,"" it's more like an ointment. That made no difference to me as it still worked! My baby did not seem to mind any residue and I was very happy that I did not need to wipe off before each feeding. OUCH! Wish product came in a better delivery system, like push up tube. It's a small container and not very sanitary to put your finger in each time to get product out. Despite that, definitely would still recommend to a nursing mother."
3,Helped ease the pain but caused latching issues,For some reason our son would not latch on after rubbing this herbal cream. He didn't have any problems when we used Lanolin but for some reason he didn't seem to like this particular herbal cream. The cream is very nice though -- it does heal and sooth the pain.
3,OK but not going to buy again,It is a bit greasy and did not absorb quite well. Okay product but I am not going to buy again.
2,didn't help...,i think in this case (sore nipples from breastfeeding) the only thing that helped me was to put a few drops breast milk on them every time before and after feeding.
5,great!,"this is great, i didn't use it the way i was supposed to and got sore anyway, but if i had, it would have been better than the more traditional creams out there. it's not as thick and gloppy"
5,Love it!,"I use this every day, multiple times, after breastfeeding my 6 week old daughter. It's called a ""cream,"" but it's more like the consistency of lip balm. Although it does go on smoothly and isn't greasy (unlike the lanolin cream that I sometimes use). I have sensitive skin, so fortunately I haven't had an allergic reaction to it (nor has my daughter). I like how it has all natural & organic ingredients, considering how often I use it. It doesn't interfere with latching if she wants to pop back on soon after I apply it. I highly recommend this product!!!"
3,Not the best,Smells and feels great- but wasn't the best for me. Lanolin worked a lot better for me- healed me right up. I'll use this as cuticle cream and backup lip balm.
1,May work great but be aware...,"I bought this based on all the great reviews and bc I had problems with severe soreness and trauma with my first child. However when I showed it to my lactation consultant, she said it had everything in it that they don't recommend, and that it has ingredients that can cause allergies. She said to feel free to use it on cuticles and rough feet but not breasts. I just wasn't willing to take the risk."
5,Couldn't have done it without this amazing stuff!!,The first 10 weeks of nursing were so miserable!! I almost quit several times. I cried almost every time I nursed my son. I was using the lanolin but it wasn't helping and was so thick it actually hurt to put it on. A lactation specialist who was helping me recommended Mother Love to me and it was almost an immediate improvement. Since I started using this cream nursing has stopped hurting and my son is now 9 months old and is still nursing. I wish I had had this from day 1! So glad i found it as nursing and providing my son with breast milk was really important to me. I would have regretted it if I had given up. This is a must have for any new mother.
5,WONDERFUL PRODUCT,I'm a nursing new mom. I had sore and cracked nipples and I was given lanolin. My nipples kept getting sore despite improving on the baby's latch. A friend gifted me this product and it is amazing. It does not hurt while applying and helps with the healing. I would rate it 5 star above lanolin products
