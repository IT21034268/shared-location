2,waste of time,"It was sticky, gooey and did nothing at all but stain my clothes. Like anyone who is desperate to get rid of jelly belly, I tried it. No luck and unless you are willing to run around unclothed for 30 minutes while it dries, it really is a waste of time"
1,crap,Did nothing for me . I will not buy again. Dont know what the others were reviewing. Did not like it at all.
2,Firminol was a waste of my money has done nothing,I needed to tighten my skin on my belly due to having 5 children. Didn't see any results so it was a waste of my money
1,Didnt work for me,"I saw all the great reviews which empowered me to buy this! But i used it twice a day, did ab exercises, and using the cream, I got no results. I was really disappointed because I wanted to see results like other reviews...BUT I DIDNT SO.. O WELL."
5,chelle,I was VERY EXCITED To see results so fast everybody saw the difference After 3 year of trying. It took a week to get great results. IT ReALLY WORKS!!
3,Still Waiting...,Been using for over 3 weeks now and do not feel like much is getting done. I have been using as advertised on the bottle. I will keep at it and update my review if anything changes...
5,BESM D20,"I realy like this game. It is very versitile, and the stingy gamers edition is very affordably priced."
2,The authors of this book really need a writing class,"Even if this book is filled with lots of examples it is presented with a poor outline of explanation from the very first to very last chapters.Most people in my visual basic class are confused with the way a stuff is explained.Generally speaking, the authors gave a short explanation on topics that need a clear explanation and make it very long the topics that can be concise.Chapter 7(Desigining a Multitier Database Application) of this book is a mess.It is also a waste of time for readers to prepare for the certification (Exam 70-176); the authors gave you nothing but very short notes at the end of each chapter..Buy this book if you want to waste the money and something only to buy another book to make yourself understand the same stuff presented in this book.."
1,Horribly Written!!,"I consider myself a pretty savvy programmer. This book presents advanced visual basic concepts in a muddy, unfocused, non-user friendly format.The authors definitely ignored the needs of their audience by producing this atrocious textbook!Absolutely Horrible! Avoid like the plague! This book will only frustrate you to no end and deter you from your goal of being a better VB programmer!"
3,Weak Belt,"I have had two of these tie racks...the first lasted for 2 years, the second for 8 months.The design is great and it holds lots of ties, but the same part, the belt (which holds the ties and rotates) has broken on both of the racks I bought with no obstruction or other apparent cause."
3,great until it breaks,"We bought this in the Sharper Image store. It was great for about 2 years, but then one day the belt that holds the hooks just cracked off. Ours was nowhere near capacity. It had probably never had more than 40 ties on it. We had them evenly spaced, so I know it wasn't because of uneven weight distribution. Don't know why it broke, but it was sure convenient while it lasted. Considering how much pricier it is than its competition, I would have liked so have seen it last quite a few more years."
3,Awesome... until the belt breaks!,"This was a great product, very useful, well designed, and great for organizing belts AND ties. However, the belt broke after a few years, and Sharper Image was NO HELP at all in trying to get a replacement part. Apparently, they wanted me to think my only option is to buy a new $60 rack from them. They won't get my business for it."
2,Piece O' Crap,If you don't know what this thing's design and manufacturing flaw is by now...At least the other reviews had their rack for at least a yaar. I had mine for 6 months before the belt broke.
2,Useless rack,I never knew that a tie rack would have a shelf life but this one did. The belt cracked and made this worthless. Too expensive to buy this model again for 1 years of use.
2,RUNNING ON EMPTY,"This is my fifth FRIGHTFEST film and I must admit I'm disappointed in most of these films. Only PIG HUNT and DARK HOUSE have met my expectations. Considering films like DUEL, JOY RIDE, CHRISTINE and even MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE, ROAD KILL comes up short. There are mny incredulous things about this movie, but most irritating is that three untrained youths are able to drive a ""road train.""The acting isn't bad considering the script and the inept direction. The girls were especially annoying.I've only 3 left in the series but I'm in no hurry to see them!"
2,Pointless Australian Mess. *Spoilers*,"Let me first say I am usually a big fan of the Australian Horror Films. This film starts off ok and then goes straight down hill. Road Kill takes place when a Truck rams into a car filled with four people and causes them to crash. They then go after the driver and Truck which has stopped not far from the crash only to find no driver inside. **SPOILERS** The Truck requires blood to run, playes hypnotic music causing them to leave the Highway and drive off road, has some Wolf Heads' Symbol they never explain, causes visions... Very disappointing and very lame. Waste of time and quite frankly this has been done several times before such as The Mangler. This series overall was to be as the 8 films to die for but comes up short. Way short. Pighunt was at least entertaining enough to watch if you want something a little different. **Check out ""Grimm Love"" and ""Fragile"" probably the best two films out of this series."
4,Lots of gore.,"Just seeing hunk Bob Morley with no shirt was enough for me! Lots of gore and Australian Outback scenes. Also called ""Road Train"" which is a tandem tractor trailer in Australia."
3,A Different Kind of Horror,"I thought this movie was decent, I am usually not a fan of certain actors with accents, but I enjoyed it, the actors were okay, sometimes a little over bearing and stupid, not always the obvious reaction to something happening, like running or typically screaming. But it had it's moments where i continued to watch what was going to happen. It had it's moments of being thrilling, not real scare horror, but goofy in some ways, I didn't mind this. A little too long when it should have ended, but an okay thrill."
1,This Movie Sucked!!!!,"Ok I know the characters in horror movies are suppose to have a certain amount stupidity, but these characters were unbelievably stupid. The story was just horrible.There are better demonic vehicle movies out The Car, Christine,even if your looking for killer truck driver Joy Ride is good one. This I would not reccomend to anyone even to kill boredom. Shame on you Fangoria!!!"
3,"Not Great, Not Bad.","I Just got doen watching this movie, and i was satisfied. I Could have been better, and i wish they would have chosen 3 Diffrent Actors, of the four. The Only one i liked, was the blonde guy. The Female Actresses were Very Annoying, and looked as if they were just picked up in vegas.And the Dark haired Guy, I Dont Know, just something Off. The Movie Had some creepy parts, and was actually disturbing in some parts. I Netflixed it, and I am going to buy it, to add to my Fangoria Collection. I Will more than likely, end up watching it again. I Rate this one #5, out of the 8.#1-Dark House#2-Pig Hunt#3-Hunger#4-Grimm Love#5-Road Kill#6-Fragile#7-The Tomb#8.The Haunting. (Would have been an amzing film, if it werent in Spanish. And Very Bad English Dubbing.)"
4,Collar that bitch,"I bought this collar for a very stubborn, and very small, dog breed. The collar looks enormous on her, but whenever we train the dog with it she is a perfectly obedient canine. It doesn't seem to release as nicely as some of the other collars we have seen at obedience class, but it works well enough for our purposes.The forks come blunted so they don't pierce the skin, but I took care of that quick enough using a simple sharpening stone to hone a razor sharp point. Now every time I walk the dog, it looks like a bloody scene from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The blood is a bit messy to clean up, but it is well worth it to have a terrified albeit well-behaved animal."
5,Sturdy wooden train set,"I really liked this set, it's cheap and colorful enough to grab my toddlers attention to their already huge train collection! Definitely worth having, small enough for 18 month old son to hold in his hand and fits perfectly on the Thomas/Brio wooden tracks. Plus it goes around the 'curves' of the tracks really nicely without de-railing."
2,trains,"The price is a touch steep for just some trains, i orders these as extra and now have to many"
4,It's a slack attack,If you love reggae you know you need a little slack to keep you goin'. This is a fun compilation for the young at heart so sit back get ready get loose cause soon you be in the thros of agony........... Heh heh heh. try it you may like it.
5,Love Punany Bad,"For da people who are aware of the Dancehall/Reggae Scene these songs should sound familiar, dis CD can be summed up in one little phrase.. ""live and direct""."
5,Brilliant!,"If you are new to rolling and bracing or just want to improve your rolls and braces, this is the DVD you want.Step by step, clear, logical instructions and exercises that you WILL remember when you then head out onto the water.Many examples of teaching rolling fail to not only emphasise but teach effective bracing. EJ's Rolling and Bracing teaches you to brace properly and that it is the basis of any roll. I borrowed this DVD and did not want to give it back...so I bought my own and will buy it as a present for paddling friends as well.Brilliant no matter what sort of paddler you are; white water, sea kayak, wave ski surfer."
3,At Least One Full Size to Large,"I usually always wear a 11M or 11.5 M, these are at least one full size too large on me, foot slips right out, beautiful shoe, but way way to big, seems like this is too much of a difference for any shoe maker to offer.... an 11M US , should be that, this much of a difference is just too much"
1,wow,"This book had a great deal of information in it about pre-industrial societies. BUT, it was worded in a way that made it incredibly boring and hard to read."
2,"half ok, half miserable production","This is a frustrating production to watch because every positive is outweighed by two negatives and an ok first half of the play is ruined by a dismal finale. The scene with Jupiter and the ghosts is also pathetically staged and acted. The absolute best parts of the production are the several scenes in Wales with Imogen (Innogen). The background winter haze with bare trees is the only evocative backdrop that the set designers could manage. On the positive side are the performances of Helen Mirren as Imogen. the two lost brothers and the Roman consul. The key part of Imogen's husband Posthumus is dreadfully performed. The parts of the king Cymbeline, Iachimo and to some extent Cloten are not effectively managed either despite the reputation of these actors. The rest sort of sleepwalk through the play. What a shame since we are not likely to get another DVD performance of Cymbeline anytime soon."
4,Nice to have a quality item.,"This one is a better version of 3 leg Weber grill, nice table adding more space to your porch. Big enought to feed 10 people at once."
5,Fire Good,Man like fire. Fire cook food. Charcoal baskets good indirect heat. Fire good. Food good. Air flow good. Grill Size Good. Assembly easy. Man like easy. Cooking area good. Warming Rack make cooking area more good.Man need Weber chimney starter to make fire easy.Gas for sissies. Charcoal good. Fire Good.
1,amazon buyer beware,"I was looking forward to receiving my grill and all of the accessories I ordered with it, because I know that Weber makes wonderful products. But, I never received the grill, just the accessories (rotisserie, cover, drip pans--the works). The customer service folks at Amazon alternately gave me the runaround or ignored my requests, until I asked for a refund. They never provided any explanation of what happened or offered to reship the grill. I'm now left with the task of returning all of the stuff I bought to go with the grill. Amazon has lost a faithfull customer. My advice: find an alternative source for your Weber products."
2,Not what I expected!,"When I seen the picture of the grill, it was not what I expected. I was ready to see heavy duty, fully loaded gas grill. With Double racks, two burners, solid flat grill top.Really basic and to the point.If I am going to spend money on a grill, I don't want to haveto wait for the coals to get white."
4,great product,"I also bought this for my grandaughter but only in September of 2005.wanted to see if it would hold up for the school year.It did.The bottom piece of material is wearing a bit thinner but still strong. It did rip along the top near the zipper but was easily reinforced.The straps held strong.I know this bag has been thrown , dragged and lord knows what else. For the money I was very pleased.Also we never saw another one like it at school."
5,LOVE IT,"I BOUGHT THE BACKPACK FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER, SHE LOVED IT AND EVERYONE AT HER SCHOOL ALSO LOVED IT. GREAT PURCHASE."
5,Excellent Book!,"I love this book! I have purchased it a few times as gifts for others! Everyone loves it. I keep this book out in my family room as a ""coffee table"" type book. and sure enough all of my guests always read it and are very impressed with it--if just only for the pictures and other unique memorabilia the author included in this project! Great job!"
5,I love this book!,"This book is so wonderful! It made me feel like I was seeing him in his true form. Having the ability to see his handwritten poems, look at pictures of his life and see a part of who he was....This book is a must for any Tupac Fan!!!"
5,Not comfortable over glasses,"The headset works great. The audio is very clear on receive and I get great reports on my transmit audio.Maybe I have too big a head. I find the pressure of the ear piece pressing my ear down over my glasses starts to hurt after about 1/2 hour.I thought the ""around the back"" style would annoy me but I quickly got used to it."
2,it' ok . . .,"I guess for the price I paid, I expected a little more. The tin is very small, and the blanket very thin. My little brother loved it just beause he is a total John Wayne fan, but I was a little disappointed."
5,Fantastic!,"Boy is this game great. I cannot imagine there being a better golf game created for Xbox. The graphics are terrific, and there are many different game modes for all types of gamers to enjoy. I particularly love the re-creations of some of the world's best courses like St. Andrews, TPC-Sawgrass, Pebble Beach National, etc. etc. Also, the controls are well thought out and easy to master - no floundering around for days trying to learn how to hit the ball straight. All in all, a fabulous game for Xbox - highly recommended. I hope they put this game on Xbox Live."
2,Ditos to Jeff Hunter,"My wife and I have been playing this game since Christmas and have been stuck on ""Brad Faxon"" since early January.As Jeff commented, there is no way to judge the shots for yourself, read the greens, adjust your swing for % shot, or keep from swearing at tgame for ""cheating"".My wifes ""player"" has all but 2 of her attributes maxes out and yet she still can not beat Brad.As the game says at the beginning of the Brad Faxon match "" If it comes down to one put on the 18th your in trouble"". This has happened to us more than 20 times not to mention the 5 times i did have him by 3 holes going into 15 and he actualy got a hole in one on 17 and 18 and then got a 2 foot eagle on 18 to win. (yes I mean this actualy happened 5 times.)Up to this player we were actualy having fun with this game.To Jeff Hunter:Try Outlaw Golf! Atleast on this game when your caddy blows a call you can level him with your Driver!!Over all the game is fun as long as you stay off the Tiger Challange!!!"
2,Too Easy,"Game is fun and graphics are great but it is just too easy. I just got the game and Xbox and after playing 6 rounds, with no practice, I am hitting 90% of fairways and averaging under par rounds-- and this is playing with my own profile which isn't even that good compared to the other golfers. There is no skill involved at all in driving and the fairway shots are mostly just picking the right club. It's ridiculous how easy this game is."
4,"challenging, but...","It's fun and it's challenging, but unfortunately too much of that ""challenge"" is due to some really annoying design flaws. As mentioned in an earlier review, the ""caddie"" feature is useless. It's so bad that EA really should provide a new, fixed disk to everyone who bought it. Can't imagine how they let it get through testing that way. And there are also certain holes where the laws of physics get violated. Most of the time the effects of elevation are accurately reflected in the flight of the ball, but there are a number of cases where the outcome just doesn't make sense. You just have to remember ""oh yeah, this is that hole where the ball consistently comes up 60 yards short"" and use a different club. All in all, cool game, but could've been even better with a reasonable amount of testing"
5,this game is incredible,"Wow. This game is so fun it's almost unbelievable. You can have a career mode, so to speak, where you play your way through the ranks, winning money to buy stat points and earning new clubs and balls, etc. along the way. The gameplay is amazing and the graphics are life-like. The controls are easy to use and the game isn't so difficult that you struggle to play, but it does present several challenges. I would buy this game whether you are a golf fan or not because it is hours and hours of good fun, and you can even play against your friends for skins, winning money for your own character. Overall this is probably one of the best games I have ever played. Also you don't have to be tiger, but man is it fun to be him."
2,whats with the hype,"I dont understand the rash of 5 star ratings here. Tiger Woods moves great in this thing and his swing is as good as it could be but the graphics are weak. When you look off into the horzon, everything is blurred and is ""flowing"" around the borders of objects. You cant even see where you are hitting your ball when lining up to hit because of the blurriness of objects. Also, when you are putting, again, you cant even tell if your ball is heading towards the hole and how far away it is because the graphics are so poor. This isnt very good folks."
4,It's in the hole!,I had been waiting for the right sports game to capture my attention. For most of the year I was wondering why there wasn't much in the way of golf. Then I saw TW PGA 2003. I rented the game and was immediately hooked.Perhaps the best feature of the game in the analog swing. Gone is the silly scale where you push a button in a feeble attempt to hit the perfect shot. The swing is natural and the wide range of adjustability allows countless shots from anywhere on the course. The Tiger Challenge mode was riveting. Where else are you able to go head to head with great golfers until you think you have the skills to beat Super Tiger on his dream 18. All this and the awesome commentary offered up by David Flaherty make this game one that is tough to turn off.
5,Sick Beyond Belief!...,"How anybody could complain about the graphics,backgroundor foreground,is beyond me.You people must be hooked upto some ancient t.v.'s.These are some of the best graphicsIve seen yet.In fact,this game has redeemed EA,in my eyes.So smooth and the colors are sharp with great resolution.They definitely did it right for XBOX owners this time,muchbetter than NEED FOR SPEED2.When I unlocked Black Cove andthe Scottish Highlands,my brain was assaulted and promptly exploded!Unreal sweeping vistas over looking the ocean and blood redand azure blue skies in sharp detail.Play this game when you'remad,and disaster is sure to follow.Play it with the right attitude and you will pull off some amazing victories,no matterhow tough the A.I. is.This is the best golf game ever made andI don't see how they'll ever top it.A must have.Rent it and Igaurantee you'll be headed up to the store."
4,So addicting...,"This is a terribly addicting game, trying to get through all the scenarios, tournaments, Tiger challenges, and so forth. I've been playing this non-stop for a month. There is plenty on here to keep you busy for quite a while.Two pet peeves: 1)the extra animations of hitting the ball and the 'heart-beat' of hitting a great shot gets old very quickly, and there is no way to turn it off. You can turn off the controller vibration, but the animation continues, which really slows down the game. 2)this game is too easy. I understand the appeal of being able to regularly shoot in the 50s; but sometimes it gets tiresome. I suppose the best way to play this game is to use characters without all the high ability, to turn off the spin control, and to crank up the wind. But even when I do that, I can still regularly shoot under 60."
2,good and bad,"While I have generally enjoyed this game, it's starting to drive me crazy. All of the extra animation and the ""heart beating"" that was mentioned in another review eventually grow tiresome. If you are fan of Golden Tee and are looking for something similar, DO NOT buy this game. All of the chuckleheads that designed this game should head down to their local bar, order up a pint, put $5 in the Golden Tee machine and see what a computer golf game should look like."
3,Nice while they lasted,"I have been trying different light weight steel (vs nylon) strings on my Takamine acoustic, and got around to this Martin Marquis set. Sound was pretty good at first, but only a few weeks in and they already sound rather dead, lacking a nice ring or sustain. Prior D'Addario and Ernie Ball Extra Slinky sets lasted longer."
5,"Great delivery, great product",Arrived just as the seller said it would. The adjustable collar fits my medium sized dog (20 lbs) great and both the leash and collar are high quality! The id tag has space to write the information so I wouldn't suggest using this as your sole id tag as I would assume even permanent marker would fade over time.
5,phantom 2040,"it is excellent, my son who is 12 enjoyed it more than the other two phantoms videos which he also liked. It has several interesting life lessons for adults that make it worth alot"
4,Phantom 2040,This is an excellent production of the story into a movie format. I am not certain if it is the entire series but this movie version is great.
5,Question...,"Hey. Not really a review, but I want to get the royalties for this show. Who holds this? I can't find it anywhere. Samuel French and Bakers don't hold the rights. Who does?"
3,Not as good as Dealer's Choice,"I didn't find ""Closer"" as compelling as Marber's earlier play, the brilliant ""Dealer's Choice."" The characters were nowhere near as captivating and their conflicts were extremely superficial. The flow of the play, dialog and interaction between the characters were all quite strong, however - evidence of Marbers skill in an otherwise hollow drama."
5,Sexy and Sobering,"Patrick Marber's comic drama CLOSER is a brilliant examination of what it means to be human in an increasingly technological society. Marber is interested in a world where humans interact through machines, rather than true and intimate connection. His exploration of four British thirtysomethings--Anna, Larry, Alice and Dan--has been compared to another classic four person play, Albee's WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF. While chronicling the psychosexual lives of his characters, Marber's CLOSER makes a bold cultural statement: a definitive play about a definitive era. Reminding readers and audience members of the difficulties of becoming ""closer,"" Marber viscerally suggests that human connection could be impossible for members of our millenium. Hugely popular in the UK, it is one of the most thoughtful plays of the century. As a work that shocks and disturbs while it amuses, CLOSER has become indelibly imprinted in our theatrical and personal histories."
5,Delightful from-song-to-book example.,"I was so excited to find this book. This song was used as my wedding processional in 1971 so I was happy to find it as an example of the ""from-song-to-book"" genre. As an elementary teacher for 36 years, I know children learn easily from songs. My 2 year-old grand-daughter loves the bright, charming pictures and I am pleased to be able to share this memorable song with her. My collection of song-to-book editions is growing!"
1,artistic license?,"Though I found the illustrations to be beautifully rendered I had to questions why the boy who clearly and beautifully resembles John Denver's son in the book, why does the father look nothing like John Denver? Did the illustrator/artist think it was beyond the grasp of the children of this generation to grasp a white father to have created such a beautiful brown skin boy with an afro? There is a tiny pic of them in the back of the book. I guess he figured they wouldn't read that far, or put 2 and 2 together. To some it may seem a small thing, but to those who have multi-racial families it might have been an opportunity to see a family like themselves in a beautiful book, with a wonderful song, by a gifted man."
4,Good story Great song,"This was a good story, with an even better song if you can remember John Denver a good childhood memory that I want to share with children today. A different era."
4,color of roses dvd,editing has made this somewhat boring - I think the stage show does not show off Lorrie's personality - I'm positive she would have chatted more and connected with her audience but it's not shared in this dvd. Having said that the interview segment at her home is very Lorrie and intimate - overall I like it.
2,GREATEST HITS #10,"LORRIE CONTINUES TO SING THE SAMESONGS OVER AND OVER. IF SHE HADNEW MATERIAL, MAYBE SHE WOULD SELLMORE CD'S. IF YOU ARE A LORRIE FAN, YOU WILL BUY THIS. IF NOT,JUST DIG OUT YOUR PAST GREATESTHITS - IT'S ALL THE SAME. I WOULDSAY IT IS TIME FOR HER TO RETIRE."
4,tiger woods 2003,"The games graphics and gameplay are awesome!! I really haven't enjoyed a golf game for any platform since PGA TOUR II for Sega Genesis until I played Tiger 2003. The courses are beautifully recreated and are very lifelike. The only problems I have with the game are as follows:1. You have to earn alot of money in order to unlock certain courses2. When in tournament mode, there isn't much diversity in the scores. The scores of the 128 golfers in the tournament ranged from -7 to -3. That takes away from the realism of a real life tournaments. It would be nice if I wasn't the only player who was over par(15 over par to be exact)Other than these trivial complaints, the game is almost perfect."
4,The Best Game Ever,"This game is the best. I play it nearly four hours each day and I can't stop playing it. The only bad thing about it is that your hand hurts from playing for a long time. Overall, I'd rate this item a five star game."
4,Better than the first...,"Thinking that it was impossible to be better than Tiger 2002... This one is completely better... What makes this one better is the addition of all the new courses, (ex. St. Andrews) better tournaments, and more tiger challenges... The game keeps the same concept as 2002 and does something different like letting you update your equipment... As I mentioned there is a lot more tiger challenges and some are skins games and more... The reason that I didn't give this game 5 stars is because after you get your stats built up you can whip right through the challenges, but the tournaments are a little bit more diffucult..."
5,the best,"this is a very well designed and engineered game. The range of challenges, options, ways to enjoy the game is amazing. A tremendous amount of game for the money."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!,"Wow! A PG book about a section which grew famous from its R rated exploits. WAY TO GO!!!! ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!WHO CARES!?!?!?!It is a section filled with glory hunters who have no baseball honor and vicariously live though the team to fill the void left by not getting enough play during their youth because they are ugly nerds.This book should be called ""Bleeding Bandwagon Fans: A season with people who never attended as much when the Yankees were losing, and sit there and wait to be entertained because they are geeks who's world of baseball start and end with anything Yankees related.""This is a poor representation of baseball fans."
5,Great travel dictionary,Seems to be comprehensive. Great size for traveling yet print is large enough to read. Bought this as a companion to the electronic translator.
5,Truly Love!,Could not brag on this brush more. It is so handy when you have 1 or 2 items to wash. I have had several over the years and they have worked well (except for the one I accidentally put in the dishwasher and it leaked after that).I much prefer this to the palm size OXO brush. It gets the job done fast!
4,A good idea that works,Just got one of these. It works as advertised but you need to understand that by pushing the button only a few small drops of detergent come out. That is all you need for most cleaning jobs. Great for cleaning up just a few items at a time.I never met an OXO I didn't like.
1,doesnt work,"This item did not work. The soap woudld not come out when you pushed the button. You had to push it 20 times to get any tiny micro amount of soap to come out at all. So it was more work to use it than to just do it the old fashioned way. Finally we just cut the dispensing part open wider but then all the soap poured out. It was also a major hassle to refill. The hole is so tiny you cant get the soap in. IT DOES NOT WORK. Good handle design, so its too bad."
3,Disappointed,"Thought this classic pinball type baseball game would be great. It would have been had the spring loaded ball plunger worked. When you pull back on it, it just stays tight instead of moving freely. I have to flick the ball with my finger to put it into play. You can tell that there is no quality control with the manufacturing of this game. It would have been such a simple check to make sure the few moving parts were working properly on it, but there is no doubt that nothing was checked. No since in sending it back as they will just send it to some other unsuspecting buyer. I'll have to fix it myself. That's why it's just not smart to order online. Get it from a store and you can at least check it out before you buy. Why was I so stupid. Thought I'd try it (mail order) one more time. Not again. The only thing I've ever been happy with through mail order is flowers."
2,Not very good,"Bought this game based on the Amazon reviews which are usually accurate, however, we were disappointed this time. Game arrived today and my son and I played for a few hours.Pros:- durableCons:- back popped out of the slots frequently- took countless swing upon swings just to finally get the ball to rest in a hole (out, single, double, triple)- overall not that much funWe are returning it and will try something else"
5,Great gift,Gave this to my 50 year old brother for christmas. He loves it. Brought back childhood memories while still being fun. Quality is great and it wasn't to hard to assembly.
2,spend the extra $$$,"Yes for $13 dollars you really cant complain about quality, but if you're looking for a sub that's going to put out some deep bass these are not for you! Consider spending the extra $20 on amazon and get a much better woofer or use it for a home stereo."
5,Work well to demonstrate non-newtonian fluids,Wanted a cheap subwoofer to demonstrate the effects of non-newtonian fluids for a science class (don't know what it is? check Wikipedia). These resonate well around 30-40Hz and did a good job of entertaining the kids while holding up to the extra stress of having a cornstarch/water mixture on them.
3,good,"i have a pair of legacy lwf 10 inch woofers hooked up to a kenwood 280 watt amp along with a old purple boss crossover i had for years,it had been even flooded out before and still works perfect.i put the woofers under my front seat couse i have a truck with gas tank behind my seat,so my space is very limited,so under is the only spot.its a tight fit but it works out great.they sound very good and solid for how much i paid for them.i know there is 10 inch woofers that have more bass but they also have bigger magnets and deeper mounting depth,so these ones have 4 inch mounting depth and its what fits under my seat.i think if i coud have put them into a bigger box they would pound out more bass.i say if you need a low price woofer try these,i know its not cv or jl audio, fosgates but they work for me."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR BETTER,"I bought this sub just for a cheap sub so it can just hold me over for a month while I got more money and this thing did BEAT HARD, BUT after 30 days it got soo quiet and then it just died, and I havent even pushed them hard and all i had for an amp was a 600 watt Dual amp,So if this is going to hold you over for about a month while you save money go ahead, its just check out bestbuy online for there deals,Just save your money if you like the bigger bang,,Good for an older person that would like just alittle more boom than a stock setup."
3,"10"" Speakers","I thought I could use these to replace my 10"" Woofers in a home stereo speaker cabinet. I was greatly disappointed. Though the speakers appear to be very well made, they are 4ohm speakers and even when driven with a 100 Watt/ channel reviever, do not give the booming bass that I expected."
3,good for the price,"When you turn mine up too much it makes a sort of scraping noise, probably the voice coil hitting the magnet or something. Its fairly loud. I never put it in an eclosure which would have made it louder. All in all as long as you dont happen to get a defective one(probably fairly common) it works great for the price. Worked great for my purposes (i.e. tearing it apart for the parts)"
3,legacy woofers,"If these can handle 400 watts I have too assume my 150 watt sony receiver is horribly underrated.As I know this is not the case,I must assume these woofers are grossly overrated.They work well at low to mid volume,but fail at higher.The price is reasonable but the watt rating can not be believed."
2,400 what?,"No way these things can handle 100 watts, half volume on my Sony 100w per and they click and pop like an electric popcorn machine,, only good for low volume, low wattage ,midrange stereo sytems....bass is definitly out..."
3,oops,Apparently I missed the fine print that they were 4 ohm. It's ok my bad I will read better next time
2,little bit of bass,installed 2 with plenty of power. Just dont hit very hard. if you are just looking for a little extra bass these are perfect.
1,Swap-meet quality,These only worked for two days. I should've expected it since they were on sale for $18 a piece. Don't waste your time with this product.
4,Worth it...,"Only three songs, so this is probably best for super-fans who want to listen to every Cursive song ever recorded. Worth it for the song ""The Bitter End"" alone, which is so good! The third song's just ok. And ""Dorothy At 40"" of course is on Happy Hollow, which is a great song but you probably already have if you're a fan, so there you go."
5,GREAT,"Classic funny FIF. Loved it. Played it for a girl who had never heard of them, she was rolling. The genius of FIF is captured here."
2,B-sides are B-sides for a reason,"I am an occasional FIF fan - I particularly enjoyed the ""all the hype"" album. There's lots of great songs on that album, and I still listen to it all the time. Their live album is really good as well.I picked up this album because I hadn't heard anything new from these guys for awhile, and I have to say that I was quite disappointed.This isn't as much an ""album"" as a collection of stuff that the group had laying around - old recordings of stuff, recordings of the members of the group just goofing around, stuff that wasn't good enough to be released on an official album.B-sides are left off of most discs because they aren't very good. Unless you are a hardcore FIF fan, I'd suggest you look to some of their other releases to find some good music."
3,ok,the first few songs are really good but the rest are like 3 secs long and no fun to listen to i recommend buying one of their other cds
3,Okay,Well I like the first couple songs. Then all of a sudden it'slike turning into a Sound Effect cd.I would say get one of there others
2,Not what it advertises!!!,Was disappointed when I received my order. The Ironing board cover/pad did not come with a pad. I thought because it indicated cover/pad that it was included. I contact the company but they informed me it only came with the cover. The advertisement for this item is deceiving.
2,Not useful for me,"I bought the book hoping to find good quotes and stories for sermons. It might serve well for some, but not off me."
4,Brass hooks look good but uneven backside,"These hooks are well built. The finish is nice without looking ""plastic"". My only negative comment is unfortunately the back side is not flat. In many instances where you are mounting this to a hard surface such as a wood backer this will make the hook rock. I spent time sanding the backside flat trying to get the mold marks out."
2,Ghouls...,"For me, Ghouls reads as a supplement that you knew White Wolf would publish and did so by rote. There's nothing inspiring about this book.It gets the technicals right, talking about the relationships between vampires and ghouls, talking about ghouled animals and a slightly interesting note, Mandragora (ghouled plants).There's a chapter with expanded rules for making a ghoul character then what's found in the book.The book just isn't compelling or that great."
4,Dawn of the Damned,"This book is a great supliment for Vampire: The Requiem. It includes creation rules for starting ghoul characters in a World of Darkness chronicle.This book is a must for V:tR fans. There are many interesting supliments to ghoul characters, including ghoul family lines (much like vampire bloodlines), and even ghouled flora and fauna."
1,Very Disappointed,"It was difficult for me to believe that MZB had really written this book. I found it slow and full of irrelevant details. I also did not care about any of the characters. I managed to finish it, but only because I have loved some of her other work and kept hoping she could save this one. Alas, I felt very disappointed when I finished."
1,Very disappointing,"Hated it. Zimmer's style, so wonderful in ""Mists of Avalon"" does not translate to the modern world at all. The story was weak, and there wasn't one character I liked. Emily, in particular, I wanted to throttle. She was an eighteen-year-old who acted like a six-year-old, did nothing but whine, sulk and eat. I kept scribbling disgusted comments in the margins. But to be fair, I did finish the book. And if the characters drove me to respond, I guess that says something..."
3,I thought it as all right...spooky to read at night.,This book was not as good as her Darkover books it was more of a modern gothic.If you are looking for fantasy or sci-fi you probably won't enjoy it much.But if you love MZB you will read it anyway.
2,The ending makes this book a HUGE disappointment.,"MZB does it again, making us accept a poor plot because of her beautiful prose (i.e., the Forest House) which is unusual considering her enormous talent (i.e., Mists, Darkover). But even with the quality of her description and storytelling, the ending betrays the readers. When I struggled to the last page, I was so disgusted that I threw the book across the room. This book is a huge disappointment, don't pay full-price for it."
2,What a disappointment!,I bought this because the Mists of Avalon was so well written and plotted. The Inheritor was sloppy and stupid. The characters were unlikeable and unbelievable. The 'action' was predictable and trite. Save your money!
3,"For any other auther, ok, but dissapointing for MZB","I have to say I did enjoy this book. The mistake I made was reading it after MZB's Arthurian tales. It's good for a modern fantasy book, although not really my thing. This book was a little to creepy for me with the whole evil boyfriend scene. If you don't mind a little black magic in the story it's ok. It was well written and did have good prevail over evil which made me feel much better. I did feel that Marion Zimmer Bradley almost brought me over the edge with too much evil."
4,Opteka 500mm Hi-Def Telephoto Mirror Lens,I HAD ONE OF THESE MANY YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS INTO 35mm SLRS AND IT WORKED WELL. I RECENTLY PURCHASED A CANON EOS 20D AND WHEN I SAW THIS LENSE AT THIS LOW PRICE I HAD TO HAVE IT. IT TAKES GREAT WILDLIFE SHOTS FROM ABOUT 1/2 MILE AWAY FOR CALF SIZED ANIMALS AND BIRDS AT ABOUT 1/4 MILE. ALL IN ALL ITS' A FANTASTIC LENS FOR THE PRICE
1,foggy pictures,"I own a Nikon FM10 and bought this as a special offer. Wrong choice. Difficult to focus, with foggy pictures at the end. Simply a piece of junk."
1,Be Careful!!!!! I Have a Nikon D-50,"I recieved this lens in new and good condition. I can not get this lens to focus clearly on my Nikon D-50. Also, the focus adjustment is very sensitive and difficult to use without a tripod. Therefore I don't think sporting events would be appropriate for this lens. Even on infinity beyond the minium focusing distance the image is not clear. I may have recieved a lemon. But it is very cheap indeed. I can't adjust my camera, apperature, with this lens on, even in manual, just the exposure time. The downloaded picture with the picture info says F0 at 0-mm. I will work on the problem and see if it can be resolved. I am new to the Digital camera SLR but not to photography. On the other hand this lens has a lot of potential if you can get it to focus."
1,Tie rods,Would not recommend this product. Rusted after the first few times it got wet and wore out very quickly. Junk
4,Earthsearch... But who are the searchers?,"This review is based on the BBC Radio Serial. (Late 70's/early 80's?) I have recently acquired the book, and I am still searching for the sequel ""Earthsearch 2"" which was also broadcast as a radio serial by the BBC.The story is quite amazing, and difficult to summarize without spoiling it, so I will try just to give some impressions. Much of it takes place on board a gigantic (miles long) spacecraft, which is equipped as a ""generation ship"" and has crew hibernation facilities. There is an equivalent to ""HAL 9000"" (very different in personality though) in the form of two computers known as the ""Angels"". The most amazing thing about this story is the fact that if you follow certain clues, and you have astronomical knowledge, you can figure out where and what things are, and indeed the date (to a millennium or so).If you can find Earthsearch 2, it is just as exciting as the first book!"
3,It's Okay. Buy This If You Are New To Gameboy Advance Games.,It's okay for newcomers. Kinda boring after awhile. The driving part just stinks. It is very stupid. However the Skateboarding is VERY cool. Don't buy this expecting Action.
5,Excellent flannel,"Model adidas comfortable, cool, soft texture, nice color, confeccion good, in general, excellent product highly recommended"
1,DOS system - check that you have it before you buy!,"I bought this game - it is a fantastic game, except this particular version runs on DOS, so my 2010 windows 7 system doesn't support it.Shame - its an awesome game!"
4,"It's Cool, but it could be better","OK, first of all, the game rocks! The company that makes it has improved the games a lot. AUF had an MRL-22 that had a guidable missile. Problem was you didn't see where it was so you could lose is, i could easily backfire on you, and it got boring really fast. NF has a replacement that was featured in TWINE, called the sentinal. In TWINE it wasn't guidable but here it is. There's a new laser, the Samurai, and there are mini vehicles like tanks, and helicopters. Somebody said there was a snowmobile but I haven't seen one yet. There is even and opening song: wow! Allover the game is decent. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the grappler (Q-Claw in AUF). In AUF the technollogy was better, it was like a grappler hook, and would go into most things. But here it only goes into hooks. Oh by the way I forgot there are turret guns in one level!"
5,good game,it is a realy good game.You can be aton of charecters from old bond movies.You should by the game.
4,Good game....not the best,"I recently purchased NightFire, and i have to say, it did not live up to expectations. All around, it is a good game, but i feels like EA may have rushed the production a bit. The graphics are a bit sketchy on the 1st person shooter levels, but the driving missions are fantastic. The only other downside i can see so far is the sound quality. Even with these negative aspects, it is a great game and i would recommend it to any fans of the previous Bond games."
4,Second Rate...,"Okay, let's get one thing straight, even the worst James Bond movie is pretty darn good. Nightfire seems to follow that. In my not so humble opinion Agent Under Fire was ten times better. The driving levels in this are nothing compared to the ones in Agent Under Fire. Am I saying don't buy this? Not at all, but I do recommend AUF ahead of it. By all means by this one too. The game is good and the multiplayer is excellent."
2,chEAp,I got this game a while ago. It's single player is pretty good. Though sometimes the missions get long and boring. Multiplayer isn't that good. you can choose to create bots to fight you with a friend or something. But on some levels that you choose you can go in cable cars but the bots can't. you can go on the roof but the bots can't. You can snipe but the bots can't. You can use mounted guns but the bots can't. The only thing that bots can do is shoot you. It's basically just like doing target practice
3,Short Short Game,NightFire Rocks in Single player mode which you have to stop terrorists from of course doin their evil doin. Multi player mode is where u'd think alot of the fun would be u are wrong. NightFire is a waste of a multi player mode it ...! and the AI is ridiculously stupid. If your looking for a fun time RENT dont BUY becasue single player mode is the best yet it is short.
4,Cool!,"Decent AI, good levels, good guns, this was my favorite game at one time. Despite its rather horrible reviews, this game is awesome.BUY IT! It's better than goldeneye ... i think so"
1,Dont Buy It,Dont buy Nightfire. It is very boring. The missions are long and stupid. I hate all the bond games especialy the new one. The colors in the game are really bad. And the guns are stupid and not real in real life. Theres a automatic gun with a scope and you cant look trough the scope. Unless you love bond games dont buy this. The grafics suck.
4,It's the halo for PS2 (only on multiplayer),"Altough the story is just you're typical 007 story, the multyplayer is great. You can set up bots in place of real people, set up the weapons, be different characters, and choose different maps. The only problem is that the bots are retarded. But it's still fun!!!"
4,Multi-fun,"Bond is back in a all new...game.Yes 007 is back for PS2,X-Box,Gamecube,GBA,and the PC systems.This time Bond must stop a villian from launching missles on earth.All new weapons and gadgets,and vehicles make you ready for 12 action packed levels.This game is Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.Multiplayer mode is so much fun.You get OddJob,Jaws,C.Jones.UH-OH,I was telling you some of the secret characters.Some Cheats you may ask okay I'll give you 10 cheats.1.MAGAZINE(Bigger sniper clip)2.PARTY(All multiplayer characters)3.TARGET(Golden gun)4.SLEEPY(Stronger tranquilizers}5.BLASTOFF(Countdown level)6.Q LAB(Golden P2K)7.PHOTON(Faster laser)8.TNT(Demolition mode)9.GUARDIAN(Protect mode)10.SCOPE(Assassination mode)T-Suggestive themes,Violence"
5,Great FPS,"This is a great game that will provide you with hours of enjoyment. The graphics are great and you get to pilot a submarine, act as a gunner in a mini-plane, drive an amoured 4WD vehicle. Only downside no cheat codes..but hey it's fun"
3,Good.. for a while....,"This game was very fun for the first week... but as soon as it got old... it got boring. The single-player missions are sooooooooooo easy or extremely hard, like the one where you are underwater and you have to destroy the submarines.. it's either easy or hard (depending on how good I'm doing that day). Once you get the hang of this game... it's too easy! I really like the multi player mode but... the courses aren't good. The Skyrail is an exception, though. The weapons are great, like the Sentinel, Scorpion, and the Phoenix Samaurai. The weapons also go back to GoldenEye weapons, like the PP7. The characters in multiplayer are in the game as of some of your ""favorite"" villains and Bond's allies (all ladies for MI-6, bad!). This a great game but gets old. I'm stopping you from buying this game... but I think only true OO7 fans who have a gaming system should get it. Otherwise, rent or skip this game."
2,Average Game,"As we all know, (you should) GoldenEye was and is the best James Bond game. It had excellent controll and beatiful graphics and simple gameplay. Perfect. Unfortunatly, EA Games has bought the 007 license from Rareware. NightFire, the James Bond action adventure title, is not based on any movie so the developers could make up there own Bond story. This game has one of the most Oblivious story line. A man wants to destroy the world and Bond is sent to save the world once AGAIN. The game has Excellent graphics but the levels are boring and unathousiastic. Though the vehicle levels are fun, there are only 2 cars to choose from. You can also ride in a helicopter and a snowmobile. Classic Bond. This game is good for a rental for it is so short I was able to beat it in under 3 hours. Average game but EA STILL CANT BEAT GOLDENEYE. So my recomindation is RENT BEFORE YOU BUY THIS GAME."
2,"Don't buy, rent","So, this game is really not that good. The graphics and sound are stunning, to say the least, but that is where the good news ends. The levels are laced with cut scenes, so you're not playing all that long. The enemy AI is obscenely lousy, even on the 00 Agent setting (example: on level 11, you walk into a room with a mechanical door that makes all sorts of noise, and the fellow at the control station keeps looking straight ahead.). I also found the controls to be some what cumbersome, making it difficult to shoot. Also, should you decide to get it, make sure you turn 'Auto Aim' off. The computer will point you directly at the midsection of the enemy, where they are conveniently most armored. All this said, it took me about 3 days to beat it on 00 Agent, and I don't believe I played for more than 2 hours in one day. The multiplayer is okay, in that you can team up with your friends or AI bots and play against another team of AI bots."
2,Dinodean,"This is a 80/100 shooter game. For those of you who like Halo or Halo 2, this game is so-so. Very unrealistic. I was playing 1 player and this happens to me on every level: I am sniping, I shoot a guy in the foot. Guess what happend? He grabbed his stomach with both hands and fell over! SOMEWHAT UNREALISTIC GAME!"
4,Amazin game ever,This game is the best game ever in my entire life. The multiplayer is so cool too. When I saw the cover I knew that this was a good game. This game has good graphics. When I finish the game I feel like starting the game over and over again. BEST GAME EVER MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,NOT GOOD >:(,I HATE the controls in this game it is the worst ive ever experienced. The camera is so hard to control and it bugs the hell out of me! But the game does have some good points i liked the opening movie and the song~hehe! but if i were you i wouldnt waste my money(like i did) on this game~ get resident evil 0 instead!!!!!
3,interesting,The the single player mode is not to great but the multi-player is SWEET!! It was the main reason I bought the game in the first place. With single player the story is old and the missions are way to easy.I beat the whole thing in a week. The graphics are good but in multi the characters keep trying to run into walls?
5,the best since goldeneye,"Easily the best bond game since goldeneye. The multiplayer is great, you dont need to have another second player... The gadgets are awsome. Laser bombs, suitcase bombs, remote control vehicles, etc etc. Its awsome and addictive. Buy this game!"
3,Mostly the same as her first book - Don't buy both,"Having read Christine's first book ""How to Rent Vacation Properties by Owner,"" I was pleased to find that she had written another. After reading the Amazon description, the author's bio and the acknowledgements in the front of the book, I was sure that it was a sequel to the first book. Amazon even has a co-marketing deal where you can buy both books.I was greatly disappointed to find that most of the info in the book - down to the examples and quotes she uses - came straight out of the first book. Many of these were word-for-word. There's a few new ideas, but this really should have been marketed as a 2nd edition of ""How to Rent Vacation Properties by Owner"" than as her second book.In fairness to Christine, I have to say that the content of the book is still great. I just wish it wasn't a near replica of the first!"
1,Don't bother,Buy the second edition. There isn't enough in this edition to justify having both editions. The second has virtually all of this edition plus lots more.
4,Perhaps the best of its kind,"This gorgeously illustrated guide to the whole of France is just as interesting for the browsing armchair tourist as for the traveller who actually plans to go abroad. It provides not only standard tourist information but fascinating background on French history, lifestyle, etc. The maps in the Appendix are perhaps a little difficult to use, but the book is worth the price just for the thousands of full-color photos and cutaway diagrams."
5,Typical DK great quality and content,"This is the 4th DK travel book I have purchased and it provided the expected great pictures, descriptions and directions I have received with each. Highly recommended for people planning trips to other areas, especially overseas. Going on a trip to France and Spain so got DK and Steve's to complement each other. Steve's goes deeper into major cities but can not match DK with a complete country coverage and unique pictures and descriptions of every village and town along the way. Could not imagine planning a trip without this book."
5,Eyewitness France,"This is the second copy of this wonderful travel guide I have bought. The first was in 1998. Fabulous maps, photos, descriptions and just so pretty to look at. Invaluable. It is not in anyway a book like the $50 a day kind of thing. Wonderful info on history, architecture, street maps of towns. Best there is. Lolo."
5,Very Helpful,"Just returned from a two week visit to Europe, mainly in France. This book was much more user friendly than the typical Michelin guide and I highly recommend it. Places are easy to find. Lots of information makes it easier for you to get an impresssion of a particular place, what to see, what to do, and will it will feel like being there. Highly organized and user friendly."
5,"Succinct layout, detailed maps, full info on all regions.","An absolutely incredible book for value. Thoroughly accurate details. See every Region of the country. Hotel/Freeway info, sightseeing tours, costs, best times of yr to visit, open/closed dates for sites. Absolutely invaluable. The best pocket guide which takes you there through photography & accurate info."
5,DK EYEWITNESS TRAVEL BOOKS,"I purchased a DK Eyewitness Travel book a few years ago and found it to be my choice after looking in atravel section at a local bookstore. I needed one on Paris and it had the same fantastic organization andhistory and so purchased this one on France. The DK Eyewitness Travel books are tops, in my opinion."
5,the essential guide book to Paris-Eyewitness Travel Guide,"I do not speak French and this was my first trip to Paris. My girlfriend and I are both over 40 and were going to spend 10 glorious days in Paris. Eyewitness was the most important item we brought with us. We were able to easily locate every place we wanted to visit and the most simple way to get there. The subway guide was absolutely the best. We were able to ride the subway all over Paris without the least problem and view all the attractions listed in the guide along the way. The guide gave us tips, like buying one pass for all museums, which we would not have known otherwise. I was amazed at how many other tourist had the same guide. It was more or less the bible for most tourists. I would highly recommend this guide to anyone planning a trip to Paris."
3,Great photos and descriptions; not good for hotels,"I used this to plan my recreational activities but not hotel reservations on my vacation to France and found it to be very helpful. I especially appreciated the historical tidbits on different areas. My complaint is that the hotel recommendations are severely limited and the ones that were recommended were quite pricey...not what I would recommend for a traveller on a budget. The other complaint I have is that the book is heavy and for someone who is doing much walking, especially in Paris, this is too much to lug around. It's small but weighs a little over two pounds."
5,Good Clean Brew,Nice and bold. Not at all bitter. It makes a great cup of coffee in the Keurig. I've bought eight boxes of this stuff and plan to buy more. Definitely worth a try whether you're into organic or not.
4,Coffee people bold organic coffee review,One of the best I've tasted. Most are very weak and not good at all.
3,An extra star (or 2) for organic,"Coffee People's Kona blend was much better. This one had a very bitter, tasteless taste; even with some sugar added it was almost undrinkable. I suppose a good-quality organic bean would cost more than the same quality bean of the regular variety, so to keep the K-cup cost the same a sub-par organic coffee must be used."
5,Good!,"I am reviewing this product because I recieved it in the variety pack that came with the Keurig B40. I am rather selective when it comes to coffee and this was one of the free K Cups that I liked. It was not my favorite, however I would consider buying it again. Two coffees that I like in K Cups more than this are Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold Special Blend, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2) and Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Organic Sumatran Bold, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2). This, however is also very good. I try only to buy Extra Bold because the others just aren't that great. I had absolutely no idea what Coffee People was, and still don't. This is a good, strong cup of coffee. Not spectacular, but the fact that it is organic is good as well. You will not dislike this coffee."
4,The Lighter Side of Dark...,"Smoky, earthy, and a little peppery. Possibly the least dark of all the Coffee People roasts. I like Black Tiger a little more, but this isn't bad. Good for two of the smallest cup size in a pinch. It holds its body even with a lot of cream and sugar, which is more than I can say for a lot of other k-cups."
2,"Dry, bitter coffee","Unfortunately, this coffee is strong, but not flavorful. It's OK (not great) if taken black, but once cream is added, it somehow makes the burnt, dry taste of this coffe even more pronounced. I am looking for a coffee that has a rich, nutty, full-bodied flavor even with milk. It's hard to get any flavor at all with K-cups because of the almost non-existant brewing time of the Keurig machine. Due to this problem, one has to buy very strong K-cup roasts to get any flavor at all. However, I am sure that there is a K-cup out there that is strong enough to come through the quick brewing process and taste rich and flavorful rather than just burnt-tasting and nothing else."
4,Great Coffe Brand,"This was the second type of coffee I've purchased from the Coffee People. The other, Bold Tiger, is even better than this, but this is quite good too.."
2,Corn Brush,Didnt work as I thought it would. It didn't take the husk off like I would have preferred. Its better to just do it by hand
3,"Just ""ok.""","This product works just ""ok."" The bristles are a little too soft to remove all the silk. At least it did not damage the corn kernels."
3,Corn Silk Brush,"This product did nothing to remove corn silk, but wired great to clean a Squeezo strainer. Maybe it should be re-marketed."
4,excellent brush for the money,"excellent brush, silk falls right off the corn, downside the top is not sealed proberly which allows water inside while washing, but still excellent for the cost."
4,corn brush,"This was the closest to the pampered chef brush I had. Works pretty good but the green bar on top needs to come off, all it does is hold water when you wash it."
2,Fragile for the money,"This is our second sink grid for our Rohl sink. Althought the grid fits perfectly, which it should, the white vinyl coating/covering is not durable for sink use. Next time we'll buy the stainless steel grid."
3,Rohl sink grid,The covering of the grid is not very sturdy ... you must be very careful with knives ... like don't put them on it. I had a knick in it before I even used it. Previously I had another grid that did not do this. Otherwise it fits perfectly and looks good.
5,The finest translation of Baudelaire in English,"This bilingual edition (masterfully translated by Norman Shapiro) carefully transposes the French originals into a formal, poetic English idiom, which captures both the meaning and the music of Baudelaire, the fallen angel and champion of evil. Though conventional in terms of his metrics and poetic forms, Baudelaire is arguably the first great Modernist poet. One dives into the murky miasmata of these pages to discover a world of perverse pleasures, wrathful and sordid imagery and unregenerate vice glorified by one of its most eloquent spokesmen. Baudelaire, a tortured personality, in which profound guilt is contraposed with carnal lust, Satanism, delight in cruelty and a longing for hell, is one of the towering giants of modern European literature. His poetry is a bitter fruit that few can savour with impunity."
3,Beautiful Poems - Bad Translations,"Beautiful poems and imagery. Unfortunately, contrary to what others have commented, I found the English translation oftentimes so different from the original French that the rhythm and sense of the verse if lost.Wonderful collection of Beaudelaire's works but would look for a better English translation."
5,Great sound for the size,"I love these speakers, They sound so good that I moved my sub out of my room and into the living room where parents don't have one. these would be a perfect set of speakers to place in the den to enjoy music in there."
2,Its not hard to find a better bookshelf speaker,"Summary:I bought these as a replacement for some Mission bookshelf speakers which I gave to a friend in exchange for a loan he gave me to buy some rare speakers Dick Shahinian designed for Harman Kardon about 35 years ago. I have the ARs hooked up to an old Harman Kardon receiver which I have attached to a computer. In my opinion, they sound awful. They are bright, brittle, have NO bottom end (which is understandable given the size of the drivers) and are not musical in the least. I suspect I'll be happier replacing them with a $79 pair of computer speakers. The only reason I have not is because I don't have any place for the HK receiver and I could not in good conscience give 'em away.Strengths:Small size, cheap.Weaknesses:Sound awful.Similar Products Used:Mission bookshelf speakers"
2,Not for cold weather,"Sound was amazing all summer long, then winter came and everything stopped working. after some testing I found out that when the subs get cold their resistance doubles and my amp can't overcome that in order to make them work. its only been around 32 degrees F too."
3,Fun toy and great customer service.,"This would be really great except the magnets don't stick to the wood pieces. We also have the Haba Indian Summer and those magnets stick really well. These slide right off so you end up with a pile of wood shapes that don't stick to the magnet board. Also, while the other Haba magnetic arranging games have a thin wood magnetic board, this one is just a piece of cardboard.UPDATE: I contacted HABA by email and they immediately replied saying they would take care of the problem. They sent me a new set of magnets (which have the 3M logo on the back) and so far they are sticking really well. I am very impressed with their customer service."
4,"An Austrian ""Lord of the Flies""","""The Confusions of Young Torless"" reminds me of William Golding's ""Lord of the Flies"". Though I sometimes sympathize with ""Young Torless"", I like him much less than Stephen Dedalus of ""Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man"" by James Joyce or Holden Caulfield of ""Catcher in the Rye""by J.D. Salinger. Though I remember very little about it, there could be an affinity with John Knowles ""A Separate Peace"". I do remember an atmosphere of violent cruelty and adolescent cowardice which binds ""Torless"" to both ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""A Separate Peace"". I admire all of these authors for focusing so acutely on the sensually disturbed adolescent male--spot-on each and every one of them!"
5,Making an arbor for 410,Did not get to use in 45 colt but to make an arbor for 410 shotgun. Could no find arbor for 410 but only had to remove 0.005 inch along length of body and it worked fine. Did not have a lathe to turn arbor but made a holder and spun in drill press and worked down with 10 inch smooth cut file. Since there is a pistol that shoots both a 45 long colt and 410 I new they had to be very close in case diameter and they were and it works fine.
4,nice,"the item is not the most common, worked great with a very light mod with the grinder. you cant beat this system for being versatile with all the different arbors to choose from."
2,Poor Quality,Poor quality product. Metal is very weak & bends easily. The keychain ring gets in the way of the bottle opener. Gets 2 stars because its only $3. It's better to spend the extra money and get one from a quality name brand.
2,"never received the red one, got black one","Ordered 1 red one and one black one, Received two black ones, Not happy about that since they are going to 2 brothers."
4,I'ts an okay game for the prtce you pay,I know many people have said alot of bad things about the game but it honestly isn't that bad for the money you spend on it. It can be tedious at time since your communication with people is limited to introducing yourself the first time and gossip to get people tolike you enough to interoduce you to more people or help with the complaints of your citizens. It has it's moments when you get annoyed when you can't find the help necessary and lose people because of it. But overall it is a charming little game that is worth the money you'll pay for it. It is addictive.
3,pretty good,"The game is pretty fun and addictive.The graphics aren't too good, but the buildings are pretty cool looking.It doesn't really have much to do with building a city, but it's pretty fun putting in buildings, solving other people's complaints, and personally, I like to jump.I think that they should make this game a little more like Sim City in the fact that you get to control more things in the city.If they were to come out with a sequel to this game, I would probably buy it in the hope that it was better."
1,disappointment,"I was so excited when I found out there was a game that involved building a city other than simcity, etc. I bought the game quickly and played it only to be so let down. The game really has nothing to do with building a city other than chalking out roads. The game is kind of unique because you have to manage city problems by inviting in new residents, etc. but overall you just walk around and talk to people over and over again. The game really wasn't my taste, and I ended up selling it very soon. The graphics, intrigue and lure of the game maybe more suited for children under 15, but older than 10 (in my opinion) I wouldn't really recommend this game."
3,"Good protection, but that's about it","This case is good for transporting the DS and protecting it from scratches during transport, but nothing more. It has a place for 3 game cards and an extra stylus, which is also handy. The bottom part is made from solid rubber that holds the DS in place, but the plastic lid seems like it could shatter if something heavy fell on it.It would have been nice if there was a way to charge the unit while it is in the case.All in all, it does what it looks like it will do."
1,Terrible Script and Bad Bad Bad Acting,"I rarely write this type of commentary but this movie is so bad, maybe I can steer a few people away from wasting their money. I love horse and horseracing movies even the not so great ones. But this made my list of all time worst movies of any genre. Predictable story line and terrible acting all the way around. However, if you are interested in listening to the constant whiney bantering of a bunch of geeky teenagers, then this movie is for you.Want a great horse movie? Check out ""King of the Wind"", 5+ stars!"
3,Over'looked' horsey drama,"Paschal Draney (Esther Purvis-Smith) is a tough, no-nonsense tomboy who works as a runner for bookies at the track. Social Services steps in, and the girl is put in a foster home. Charles Armstrong (Duncan Regehr), a wealthy horse breeder, hopes that his new foster-daughter will befriend his wheelchair-bound teenage son, Clancy (Tim Battle). Instead, Paschal takes a shine to a different handicapped resident at the farm, a nearly-blind horse called Primo Baby. With the aid of a seeing-eye horse, Saygold, Paschal and Primo Baby earn the right to compete in a prestigious race. High drama, but entertaining.Staci Layne Wilson"
2,Survivor with naked women.,"Wildflower really had potential to be the rare erotic thriller to work both as erotic and as a thriller but sadly it loses steam halfway through. The set up: rich heirs head out to the woods to settle some family fueds but are sabotagued by a sexy stranger. The dangerous liasons result in quite a body count (in both interpretations.) Sadly, the plot becomes ridiculous and smarmy by the end and Wildflower loses its smarts.Regardless, the girls are lovely. It's better than most erotic thrillers but that's not saying alot."
1,Hilarious,"This one almost falls into the it's-so-bad-it's-good category. Awful, cliched script, hideous acting, obnoxious attempts at nudity and sex, a leading man who gets squeaky-voiced during precarious moments, charmless, silicone-breasted lesbian bimbos, ridiculous plot twists - all of this done with a straight face, which is what makes it so awfully funny. Recommended to those with a taste for bad cinema and the sense of humor to enjoy it."
1,Poorly made product,"We have returned this product twice now for various problems. On one, the face of the clock was unglued and dirty, it rattled and had a grinding sound when the train went around the clock. The second one - the hour hand didn't work, the train didn't go around the clock (we just heard a clicking sound) and the face of the clock appeared similar to the first one. Very disappointed. Very cheaply made product. Customer service with the company we ordered from has been excellent."
5,"More of this, please!","For the platform game junkie or the casual gamer, Ty is unreal. Please make more games like this. OMG this was great!"
3,An Xbox game for kids (finally),"1. If you're a ""hard core gamer"" don't bother, but...2. If you have kids that are 7 or so and want something a bit challenging, but not frustrating, this game is fun. Much better than the ""Crash Bandicoot..."" which was released earlier this year. I'm sure it'll get old after a fw weeks, but not as frantic as ""Blinx"" and something fun to play with the kids (and when they fall asleep slip in ""Hunter the Reckoning."")"
5,great overall game,"I loved this game. My kids (7 and 4) loved this game. The graphics, music, storyline are all good. The only downside was the final ending - it tooks weeks of hard work to reaqch the final ending and then it was a bit anticlimactic since one would assume a big splash at the end and instead it was nothing special. But I still highly recommend this game to families."
4,keeps them entertained,"My 6 year old will sit and play this game for hours. It is a little hard for him at times but he enjoys it, and so does his step-dad. He wanted a game to play and this just happened to be the one we found. Terrific! They just need to put out more games for kids now! If you want a entertaining and non-violent type game for your kids...this is a good choice!"
2,Had it's funny moments,"Ok, this is a real low budget film with bad acting(and even worse writing) but it has its funny moments. These moments weren't meant to be funny, however they were.An ancient evil being called the bonesetter is abducting kids and plans to offer them as a sacrifice to the devil. A bunch of acting school drop-outs plan to stop him.I am still looking to see a great indie film and although this isn't it, there are some good things about. The sound and film quality are very good for an indie project. Honestly, the downfall of all these no budget films it that they can't afford to hire quality actors or screenwriters. One day perhaps an unknown talent will be discovered. Anyway, good for a laugh."
1,More stupid than a pack of morons.,"I had the unfortunate ""priveledge"" to view this movie at its premiere and I have to say that this is the worst movie ever made. Do not under any circumstance buy this movie. If you are buying and you are a fan, then I am afraid that you are mentally insane. This is the perfect reason why indie films suck! The acting blows! The directing sucks. (...)"
1,Won't Install And Lousy Tech Support,"Software would not install (Error 1606). Several calls to tech support just got me a ""try again later"" after waiting on the phone for 15 minutes. Aladdin Systems web site offers no updates or tech support form. Just a forum board that you can join, I suppose to ""discuss"" your problem with other users. I've bought a lot of software over the years. This product and company are the worst I've found. There are better options out there, if you want compression software."
4,A great introduction to midcentury furniture,"This was the first book I got on modern design, recommended to me by a vintage dealer, and it's still one I refer back to regularly. There are images of many of the classics of the period, many presented in contemporary room arrangements showing how they can ""work"" in a real setting. I now have most of my house furnished with vintage pieces, and I have to say that this book has a lot to do with it."
3,Very good older. It was also nice to see Elke Sommer in one of her few dramatic roles; would've been better to see more of her.,"This is an older movie I'd seen many years ago and had forgotten most of the story line. As usual, the transfer to DVD greatly enhances it. I had expected to see more of Elke Sommer but it was interesting to see her in a dramatic role. Although she was good, she is much better in comedy roles."
5,Awesome book,"The book is a wide selection of delicate and touching fine black and white prints. It certainly adds volume to my ""artsy"" collection."
4,Pyramid did well with this one!,"Mind you this isnt the sleekest Pyramid Amp ever made but man does it shake the ground with a good pair of Subs!I bought this AMP three years ago and used it to push two 15"" RockFord Fosegate Dual Voice Coil Subs. I was shocked to see that it is still in production but pleasantly so! This was one of the best AMPs I ever bought. It out performs my MTX Thunder 4200x2. Mine was stolen about two years ago and was so happy to see this AMP I bought it for my Wifes Car."
2,Probably something better out there,"I bought this amp to power my 10"" sub woofer. I have a Pioneer CD player with pre-amp outputs and subwoofer controls. This amp does not respond to the stereo controls, just a flat, constant level. I couldn't get the bypass or frequency levels to respond either. It's possible that I just didn't know what I was doing, but I don't think that is the case. I sent this back and will replace it with something else. Not recommended."
2,My opinion after use...,"I purchased these to make personal size pizzas but they don't work with regular pizza dough. The center of the dough remains uncooked even after the outsides are almost burned.However, they are great for making kids pizza from pre-made biscuits or pita bread and even as a small pan to cook snacks."
3,Does the job.,"These little pans work great for making little personal pizzas. We have fun with our kids. I removed two stars because they became severely discolored after just one usage/washing. They don't look very good now, but still function just fine."
2,Does not cook through the center,"I purchased these mini pizza pans in order to make tortilla pizzas for snacks. When these arrived in the mail, I opened them up to make my first pizza. Unfortunately, the pan wouldn't fit in my toaster oven. So I moved my pizza onto a piece of aluminum foil and I had a perfect pizza.The next time, I made 4 pizzas so I put them in my big oven. Unfortunately, the tortillas did not ""cook"" all the way through. I used store-bought tortillas so they were already pre-cooked, but I still liked to cook my tortillas to get rid of that residual raw dough flavor. These pans are nice and sturdy. However, that means that they are so thick that they don't allow the dough/tortilla to cook all the way through. I can only imagine the amount of raw dough you would have if you were to use real pizza dough. They should have drilled holes into the bottom to allow for even cooking."
5,I am completely satisfied with my Jade Fushion Yoga Mat,"I chose the Jade Fusion Yoga Mat after trying my instructor's. I was using a mat that my gym provided and I noticed my joints hurting, especially my knees. There is absolutely no comparison; you pay for what you get. Yes the Jade Fushion is more expensive; however, you cannot put a price on keeping your joints healthy and pain free. I really like the cushion it provides to my joints. The extreme odor that some people talk about is simply not true. I would recommend this mat to anyone doing yoga."
5,Better than the Manduka Black Mat,My wife and I got this mat and the fancy schmancy pricey Manduka Black Matt at the same time. We alternated the matts each yoga session. We soon realized we both always want to use the Jade Fusion.
3,long time to break in then wore out quickly,"I bought this mat about a year ago ... I wanted a durable mat with as much padding as possible for hot vinyasa yoga. This seemed like the thickest one out there. It took a couple of months to break in, with a strong rubber odor and a little too firm. Then it was a terrific mat for 8-10 months, no odor, thick, soft and not slippery. Then it started to break down, offering less cushion, felt thinner (and rolled up thinner as if the material had compressed), and started to stretch under me and lose its grip on the floor, often sliding and stretching under me while I practice. My joints have started bothering me due to the reduced cushioning from the worn out mat. I practice about 5x/week and this mat wore out in less than a year, and it is expensive for less than a year of use."
3,Didn't Deliver,I was disappointed with the durability of this mat. It began wearing out after just a few months - literally shedding small pieces onto the studio floor. I only had it six months and already there are wear spots at the top of the mat - a hole is starting to form. I've had to flip it over to get some more use out of it. Soon I will have to buy a new mat - and it won't be this one.
3,Cushion but slippery,"I like hOw Cushiony it is, but it is quite slippery in the beginning. It seems to be getting better as I use it more."
4,"sweet mat, extra thick","This is a very nice mat. Perhaps a bit thick for yoga though, almost a pilates mat. Some balance postures are harder when attempting on such a thick mat.It has a non-skid surface that I found much tackier than some other expensive mats especially when perspiration is present.The size and weight are great. I am a taller person and enjoy this longer mat."
4,Good mat,"I have bought or tried just about every yoga mat available. This is my hands down favorite...! It really is non-slip, even in hot class and cushions the knees really well. It's a beautiful thing. UPDATE: I have had two of these mats now. Still love the mat, but only for the first few months. It then starts to become like an elastic band. So when you are in down dog, your mat gets longer! I now have the Lululemon mat and feel like this is a long term keeper, not just for a few months."
4,Good but it smells like rubber,"great mat, no slip, but it has honestly reeked like rubber for 2 weeks now. i hope the smell goes away!!"
5,One of the Funniest Books I've Ever Read,"This book contains a treasure trove of hilarious anecdotes.Here's an example. George Jessel had a lot of girlfriends. Once in Florida one was running away with another man when George took out a pistol, shot at the other man, missed him completely and winged a Japanese gardener two blocks away. He was charged, of course. When the judge sourly asked him, ""Mr. Jessel, how does a man take aim at someone and hit someone else two blocks away?""George replied, ""I'm a comedian, not Buffalo Bill.""If you liked that one you should get this book. It probably has sixty stories that good.by now."
3,Ho Hum. Not that great,"This CD isn't all that great. Nine songs. That'snot that much. I mean some songs are good like the juno reactortrack. it's quite interesting but it's not really rave per se. I mean, when I think of rave i think of 150+ bpm not drawn out slow stuff like what's on this disk. The only other song on the albume that I like beside juno reactor is Tenskwa tawa. However I think that when they were making this third album in the Best of Rave series, there was nothing really left, so they scrounged together some so-called ""Rave"" songs. I dunno, I haven't heard the first two albums, but I would put my money down on the first one instead of wasting your money on this one. So get the first albums, at least you might get the really good songs that truly deserve the title, best of rave."
4,Not Bad,"The album art is really psychedelic, and so are some of the songs. It is pretty thick with good tracks. Good vibes, and some interesting journeys through sound."
5,Over Priced,"I have this audio tape, and I only paid $11.00. For a matter of fact, I have three other tapes by Morris Chapman, and I would never pay or charge the price this seller is asking for. I'm sure Mr. Chapman is outraged. It's a shame what people will do for a few bucks. This CD should be affordable for anyone who loves praise and worship music."
4,Interesting and Useful,"This is the best work in English for humor in the late Roman republic, and Corbeill writes with insight, sensitivity, and excellent handling of the sources. My only complaint (and it is a small one) would be that Corbeill makes no attempt to distinguish between humor, invective, the laughable, the ridiculous, and so on. The conflation of these terms is a weakness, because I think there is a genuine difference between humor and invective, the latter of which Corbeill discusses at length. The book is still very good, and I would recommend it to those interested in Roman history and literature, or to anyone researching humor and theories of the laughable."
4,work great!,got these liners to use with my van ness extra giant litter pans. they work great---fit the pans well and seem to be thick enough for my 2 cats(they are both declawed). i ordered them thru amazon from another supplier and had to pay shipping--wish amazon sold them so i could get free super shipping--that would really be nice since this is an item that is used repeatedly and long term. subcription rate would be great tooooooooo!!!
4,Good Product,"These are really large pan liners which is great since I have an enclosed litter box. They have the string around the edge so that you can pull from the sides to close the bag and carry it. However, I would recommend using another bag just to put this bag with the litter in. The bag is a little on the thin side. I expected it to be thicker. I wish they made industrial strength pan liners like those large outdoor leaf bags. My cat only tears them up a little, so it's not a big issue, but one can only dream of the day the perfect non-breakable pan liner will come into existence... :3 For the price, I'd recommend this product."
2,Disappointed,"My original purchase of this product was at my local Price Chooper a few years ago. I had been using a smaller litter box and had no need for the DL715 until adopting two Maine Coons. Price Chopper no longer carried this product so I purchased them online.I never had a problem with any of the liners from my original purchase, however, I have had a problem with the new liners, it seems that there is a weak point at the seam of the drawstring. When pulling on it, the seam tears apart. This is the first box I have oepened and so far, three of the four liners have had this problem.I'm hoping this is a fluke and that the rest of the liners will be OK?"
3,good product,"Great, useful, and fit easily in jumbo litterboxes. I just wish they stayed on a little better - our cat can pull them off."
4,Near Perfect Size,"A very durable litter bag that easily handles the waste of two cats, especially one that scratches neurotically when she has completed her business. And they seem to last a long time with a weekly change."
3,A little on the weak side,Avoid bumping into anything when you're carrying out 20 lbs. of cat waste and litter. Don't ask me how I know...
4,"Beautiful bowls, but for cereal? I don't think so.","When I think of a soup/cereal bowl, I think of something that holds about 2 cups, max. These bowls hold a little over 4 cups. Who wants anywhere near that much soup or cereal? Not I. I think they'd probably work fine as side-dish serving pieces, But that's not what I needed when I ordered these. I've asked Amazon before to please list volume on kitchenware...it's always such a gamble when one doesn't have that bit of info available when making an online buy...but they say they can only give the info that manufacturers provide. Tracy Porter, are you listening?"
1,Not worth buying,"First, the icemat is unnecessary if you have a flat surface desk and a black mousepad. The mouse in game performance was similar between the icemat and a regular black mousepad. In my opinion the regular black mousepad was better. The usage of the icemat is uncomfortable because my wrist is in contact with it and I can't move the mouse as easily as there is lack of space.Second, I did not like how the black painted surface underneath peels off easily, when I took off the elevating stub supports that make the bottom surface not touch with the desk because it keeps wobbling when I use the pad with the elevating stubs."
3,"More of the same, which is not such a bad thing...","This, the second of the 'Baronies Trilogy', shares many of the same faults and upsides as the first entry in the mini-saga. Again it is well written and is an enjoyable read, also this time around the characters ring true which is a definite bonus. I wasn't too fussed with the the return of Dr Jamaisvous or the way with which it was explained, for me it ruined the excellent poetic justice ending of the fantastic 'Dark Emblem'. Mythology? Let's not even bother with that anymore... Like 'Gemini Rising' the book seems to sway uncomfortably close to setting up the backstory for Outlanders, which I personally feel it's a bit too early for. Otherwise it's a definite improvement which bodes well for the next, and last, entry in the trilogy."
2,A disappointment,"The series started out interestingly enough but this book was a disappointment. Granted I did enjoy the technology that was involved, the Kite system mainly.However, Several things really bothered me about it. First and foremost the mutants. Evolution takes millions of years to create new species. How could an entire new species, these mutated friendly water beetles, appear as a stable race in less than 100 years? Again this is the Deathlands but things are starting to get a little silly.I understand that you are trying to go for a more Science fiction feel but... How about a little explination on how these things happen?My biggest complaint is that there was not even an attempt to explain how Silas got back from the past, where he had been trapped after Dark Emblem.Another, lesser complaint is that Ryan had indeed seen an Aircraft before. Ice and Fire if my memory serves.I hope that Book 3 is not such a disappointment."
4,Hiop Hop at it's best!,"This collection brought me back to the days when hip hop was all about energy and fun! Anyone who was influenced at all by breakdancing will love it. Key songs are ""Planet Rock"", ""Play at your Own Risk"", and ""Scorpio"" by Grandmaster Flash. Innovative raps, deep bass, and that classic 808!"
1,Technical to read; in poor condition,"My rating has more to do with the condition of the book. It was not like new as was advertised.it is a little boring and technical, though the concepts are helpful"
1,It Sucks,"It sucks. Stopped working after trying to charge batteries that weren't charged for 2 years. There should be a warning that says ""For best results, charge batteries periodically."" My advice: ""For best results, buy another product."""
1,Overheated & melted!,"Do NOT purchase this charger. I assume the charger I bought was not counterfeit merch. After a couple of months, it shorted out & melted. It had never been dropped or otherwise mistreated. It also was only used a few times.I'll be contacting the seller directly to request refund (not replacement) but I doubt I'll get much help."
1,Failed after a week,"Unfortunately, the charger that I got failed within a week. I plugged it in in my garage and left a battery in it to constantly charge. After one successful charge, I found that the circuit board inside had created so much heat that it caused the plastic around it and the indicator led to melt and deform before it finally quit working. Seems to me that this may be a design flaw."
2,Could do better,"I would have selected a different product if I had known the charge duration is limited to 3 hours, otherwise the battery can be damaged. I don't have the discipline to watch the clock and rescue my battery after three hours so I can see where I am going to be burning through several batteries."
1,Battery Dud!,"Arrived promptly, before the promised date. Partially charged one battery. Then died. Purchased on 2/22/2010 and dead by 3/12/2010. Price looked good at around $11. However shipping was also $11. Wont try this again.Black & Decker 418352-01 BATTERY CHARGER"
1,Black & Decker 9.6 Volt Battery Charger,"Recieved the product quickly. However, mine burned out trying to charge worn battery. Ended up getting a better charger direct from black and decker. It appears this one comes with the actual product ie: drill and is not that good. Better off spending the extra $5."
1,it did not work,you have to be cautious about some of these batterires. They say its generic but in the end it will not work
1,Would not recommend,The second time I used this item it fried both the charger and the battery. This was an expensive lesson.
1,"On first use, plastic connecting to battery grew extremely hot with acrid smell...almost fire.","Plugged in and noted red light on the charging unit. Looks good. Within ~10 minutes, noticed an acrid smell of overheating electronics. Touched battery charger where the LED ""charging light"" is...and it was extremely hot. Smell was clearly coming from the charger.Given this was the first time I used the charger...and it almost called a fire, I would say ""stay away."" Returning defective unit and hoping I get a refund."
1,Didn't work. Got hot. Scary. Still love Amazon.,"After 3 hours of charging, I went to check on the battery. The charger was very hot and the plastic above the red light had started to melt. It has a strong smell of burning plastic, and the battery was not charged at all.Amazon is great, though, and I already have my RMA printed out and the postage-paid box ready to drop off at UPS tomorrow."
5,good charge,"Was able to recharge the battery in my drill with no problems. The product was delivered in a timely fashion. Thank you, Gayla Pope"
1,Battery Charger,I try to use this product and discarded it as it shorted out and started a burn't smell. Don't know if this product was defective or my battery caused the problem. Both rated at 9.6 volts.
1,Defective after one charge,"This charger was received on time however after charging my battery the first time, it failed to charge the second battery. The charger became hot and the LED was not operational. I returned for credit but to date, no credit received. Will not purchase anything again from this vendor.Richard"
5,Black & Decker charger for PS150 9.6 volt,"I gave up looking for this charger after my last battery died for a black & decker saw, drill & sander set. I found this one here on Amazon. It fit my set exactly. Now I can use the set until it cannot be used anylonger. But I am betting I will come back here & see if there is another set to buy. The company I ordered from sent it promptly so I could use it right away. I abandoned a project when I could not charge the battery. I can now get back to that project."
1,B&D battery charger for 9.6 v,This charger is no good. I put my battery in it and it burn up that was first time I used it. The replacement charger for this one is PS1MVC.
5,"A personal experience with The Old Man, shared.","Far too often when we read books on the Gods and Goddesses of old Europe we get a scholarly analysis with very little personality. We are inundated with dates, places, place names and other bits of information that may serve us well in our quest for data on the Gods/esses, but we don't learn how to relate to them.Ms. Krasskova has done a tremendous job relating to us, her very personal experiences with the Old Man. She shares her poems, devotionals and experiences with Odin in an attempt to open our minds to him. We can see through her that he is a multi-faceted God who isn't confined to the pages of old books, but is living and breathing in those of us who are ""fulltrui"" to him.Even those who aren't devoted to Odin can still use her experiences to jump start their own practice to the Gods/esses that they follow.This book is definitely recommended for those who are willing to think out of the box."
5,Great Service,My item arrived timely and was exactly what I wanted. My son will be so excited then he opens it Christmas day! Thank you.
3,Great Movie,"I like this poster very much but print out not very successful.Colours a little pale. I also recommend buy smaller ones. I now regret to buy that size , too big for my house."
4,"Great, but not the best of Usagi.","Don't get me wrong, I like Usagi just as much as the next fan, but the stories in here are not the best of the rabbit bodyguard's.As a fan of the Ninja Turtles growing up, I have been close to admiring anything that sports a red bandanna (red, not multi-colored as in the cartoon versions), but I think that Stan may have been leaning a little too much with a stretch here. Inserting the Turtles was great from a fan's point of view, but it does take away from the ""historical-fiction"" account of samurai legends, anthropomorphic as they are, and seems a little too cutesy for my taste.Usagi gets slightly divested of his dignity here--he's one skilled ronin--but the rest of the stories compensate for what the Turtles may detract.However, do not let reviews disappoint your enjoyment. This review is but a simple and honest opinion from my reading experience, but I enjoyed having the Turtles here, despite them not fitting properly.Have fun reading it--it's Usagi, after all!"
4,A Great comic and a great book,This book has one of the best storylines i have ever read. It has everything....from warring clans to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (they show up to help Usagi with a clan of ninja's) Also a look at Usagi's life as a little boy... Highly recommended.
2,Below Average Usagi Yojimbo standard.,"Turtles were a good joke in UY-Book3, but to continue their use in Shades of Death was a mistake. Still the book has good elements in it as well. Neko Ninja clan, etc. It is readable and purchaseable."
5,THE ORIGINATORS OF THE STYLE,"Despite what some people may tell you, MOTORHEAD were not the originators of thrash,death and black metal etc. VENOM,is without a doubt,THE band that laid the groudwork for everyone you've heard after (Bathory,Slayer,Possessed and a million more).Were they the best musicians? No. Were they the best songwriters? No. But they started the whole thing. Enough of that-on to ""Welcome To Hell""!! Raw guitars,pounding drums,and the vocals of Cronos (while not a great singer,was copied by many).""Poison"",""Live like an Angel"",""Angel Dust"" and all of the tracks really, are black metal classics. Many like their second album ""Black Metal"" better, but for me, I still like this, their debut, a little more. This is a must for anyone into the black/speed/death metal style we've come to know."
5,The infernal beginning of the era of Death and Black Metal,"Thank you Venom! Don't dictate to them! They were the FIRST! Even today, it's still too loud for the crowd and that's, without saying, a damn good thing!3 days of recording were enough for the making this album. I've been a Venom fan for the last 21 years and I ain't getting tired.Without a care in the world, they wrote and played it the way they wanted and that's part of Venom's charm. And, by the way, Mantas's solos should finally be recognized for their true value.Venom is efficiently injecting it's venom in your veins, gets you to the bone, rips your rib cage off and sucks you dry! Intense, evil and crazy, Venom is still the band that parents are concerned when they find out their kid is listening to it. Ladies and Gentlemen, from the very gates of Hell...VENOM!!!"
3,Poison alone is worth two stars,Poison is one of the best all time metal songs!Not a big Venom fan but poison is just so good you can't argue is one of the gems of all metal/thrash!worth getting just for poison!
5,THE FIRST!!!!!WELCOME TO HELL!!!!!!!!!,"You bet yer ass this is one of the most important albums EVER!! and I like this for the music more than for the fact that it BIRTHED SLAYER,OLD METALLICA,EXODUS..ETC..ETC!!! this was influenced by MOTORHEAD though dont forget!WITCHING HOUR!!!!!!!WITCIHNG HOUR!!!!!!!!!! this is worth the price alone..this is maybe the first DEATH METAL SONG ever!! Slayers version on live intrusion may be better.. but this is the ORIGINAL!!!I do think this is one of the ten best albums ever made!!!!AND YOU KNOW WHO ALWAYS TRASHES THIS?? THE POSERS!!! SO dont buy this unless you understand this concept..THIS IS 1980!!!!!!!!1980!!!!!!!"
4,"4 stars, but...","Oh Man! This is the benchmark for BAD production! Another reviewer mentions that the band treated this as a demo recording and didn't know it would be released. Did they think the recording sessions for the next two albums were demos too, because the mixes are laughable! Still, this is a fun album, and really the first of it's kind for Black Metal. You just can't listen to some of these tracks (1,000 Days, Red Light Fever, Angel Dust, Bursting Out) and not get a big grin on your face! For that I grant 4 stars, despite the production value. Good times, good times!"
4,battle for normandie?,For some reason my battle for normandie will not play....it is stuck on the intro with the battlefield WW II invasion and keeps playing the music over and over.....did i get a bad copy?...but other than that this is a great series....i would get another copy as soon as i can...
3,Not a bad textbook,"I used this book for my Environmental Geology class. Overall I think it's an ok text. It's not as readily understandable an reader friendly as some of the other introductory geology texts on the market that I have read--it's somewhat obsecure at times. I think that it's rather overpriced as well for a black and white paperback textbook.It does however cover a large selection of material in a succint manner, yet with enough detail to satisfy the curiosity of the interested student. Some of the stuff in this textbook is not common to geology texts--principally the aspects that have to do with the biosphere.Overall, it's a reasonable textbook, besides the cost, which I think is inflated. Textbook prices are inflated in general in any case!"
3,The Earth System,"A good textbook if you are unlucky enough to need one. Quite possibly to find a comfy spot, sit down and read large sections of this book at a time."
2,Overpriced for the quality,"Nice costume, size is not adult small (more like 8 year old size). Cute but fabric is lightweight and a bit flimsy, poor quality fabric. The sewing was well done. A little overpriced for the quality."
4,for the review that wanted location of big kay's burgers,there is a site (www.fast-rewind.com) that gives the locations of where the burger stand is and alot of other details about the movie....
2,good revenge,"movie was good, but i liked the soundtrack better, if anyone knows how to get the soundtrack let me know bmw2please@aol.com"
4,Thank the gods the 80's are over....,"The only reason why I gave this movie such a high rating is not because it is one of the great movies that surfaced from out of the eighties, but because it is so bad its good. The only thing I could think of between bouts of laughter is that people must have been doing loads of drugs during the 80's. ""The Wraith"" is literally a hodge podge of everthing in the 80's that was ludicrous, ridiculous, and totally lame. Just check out the car racing goons with the colored mohawks, pink makeup, belly shirts, and, last but certainly not least of all, the ton of hairspray. Charlie Sheen's fluffy hairstyle is right out of a Cyndi Lauper music video. ""The Wraith"" is almost like a horrible parody of ""The Crow."" In any case, this is one film you cannot miss, if not for nostalgic reasons, then just for a laugh."
2,Fantastic movie... Lousy DVD!!!,"This is one of the greatest movies to come out of my mid-teens. For the longest time, the only way to buy it was on really s@*ty reprints. The one I had, the f@*king picture didn't even fit the screen. This DVD is a cheep production, but thank god, at a cheep price. If your a fan of the movie, or not, I would recomend buying it.Don't get me wrong, the clean up on the film is astounding, but thats all you get. The fun of DVD's for the most part is all the extra s@*t you get. More often than not, I enjoy watching those more than the movies themselfs. My theory is, that this company put out a generic release to see what the response would be, and maybe if its strong enough they might do a 'special edition' of the film. Lets hope so, because this is one of the best movies Charley Sheen ever did!Give us the goods please!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Is this movie for real?,"Wow, what a total waste of an hour of my life, but I must say this movie........ so very bad it kinda ruled. For a movie released in the winter of 1986, it grossed 4500 dollars in its first week at the box office in the US, and grossed over 4.5 million in France. This movie made use of such high tech products as, the Digital Radio Blaster, and the flame retardant racing helmets, capable of allowing only your skin to burn yet saving your hair from a fiery death. I love movies that have a supernatural twist, yet I wonder why the spirits chose Chrysler as its provider for the ghostly super car? Also the car is powered by two vibrating lightning laden shoeboxes, strait from Chrysler's special engine division. All in all a mind numbing flick full of homosexual undertones, and great all around dialogue. Have fun with this one folks!"
1,digital radio blaster,"Worse movie ever! Never should have been penned, let alone sold to a production company. While some take pride in quality, others like Mike Marvin just peddle dribble to put their names on it and say they accomplished something. The brain numbing mellow dramatic acting was enough to convince me, that the schizophrenic next to me might actually be sane without medication. Now that I think of it, perhaps it was the medication I was missing to fully understand just how horiffic this film really was. I'm not sure if it was the ""super natural Chrysler"" car or the fact that people were blown up and burned but retained their hair, but this movie just flat out bombed hard. No wonder I saw this movie on at 2am. Enjoy this one with the schizo close to your heart and a big purple bag of medication. If you're lucky, you'll pass out in the first fifteen minutes."
4,Classic Movie,I bought this movie for a friend. It is a classic movie from the 80's the my best friend fell in love with. I hope he likes it.
5,An Oldie but Goodie,"I watched this movie so many times when I was younger and it's just as good now as it was then. Would love to see this movie on Blu-ray! I would recommend this movie to anyone who remember the 80's and the ""gangs"" of the time. It brings back a lot of memories though the sci-fi aspect of the movie you can tell has come a longer way now."
4,"Overlooked, under rated movie","Definitely a good movie from back in the day that had been overlooked. I always enjoyed this movie as a kid. I watched it again as an adult for the first time in 15 years. Not as good as I remember it being, but definitely a good car guy movie."
2,So bad it's almost good!,"Similar to the old B-grade, sci-fi movies of the fifties, this is one of those movies that is so awful in every way that you can watch and (maybe) enjoy because you quickly lose any expectation for it anyway; then your mind just happily goes along with whatever unbelieveable storyline or poor acting comes next. Almost campy. Almost fun."
1,forgettable waste of time,"This movie has no redeeming quality.It' s dated and cheesy.I kept waiting for it to get better.It never did. I really can' t figure out why anyone would give this terrible movie a good rating.Terrible acting,terrible cinematography,ridiculous formulaic plot,stereotypical costumes and hair.Please save yourself from a waste of your time and avoid this Video.If you' 're looking for a video to add to your list of worst embarrassing waste of time videos add this one. It now holds a top 25 videos not to watch on my list."
5,SWEET Movie Just wish i new where to get the car :),This movie is great! I just wish it earned the popularity it deserved. I was origanaly attracted to the movie for the car (that wich i have NO idea of what it is) but i realized the movie itseld is GREAT!
2,"Before Two&a Half Men,Charlie Sheen was THE WRAITH","Charlie Sheen,who is now on CBS' hit comedy ""Two and a Half Men"",once played the reborn alien form of Sherilynn Fenn's boyfriend in this '80s cheese-fest.Unlike his character on the sitcom,he can incinerate bad guys with his eyes--and wear a really bizarre leather outfit.I found the reborn boyfriend/alien wraith concept confusing,maybe it wasn't supposed to make sense in the first place.Randy Quaid,before playing the rancher in ""Brokeback Mountain"",plays a cop who wonders what's going on.Who expects local cops to understand the supernatural?There are wonderfully strange '80s hairdos,'80s music--it's a cheesy sci fi/teen angst space epic.How many of those exist?It's ""The Breakfast Club"" meets ""Alien."" Be prepared to be amused!"
4,The Only Adults are Cops,"This is an often overlooked 80's classic. It is one of those movies made up mostly of the 16-24 year old group, with not an adult in sight. Pretty much the only adults around are the police, who accomplish very little.The movie is about a wrongfully young man returning to avenge his death. He was wrongfully killed by a local hotrod gang. Now he is back as a wraith, with a supercar as well!"
4,you're all wrong,this movie is not about the car(although it's a really cool car) this movie is about a love so true that even death couldn't stop it. the hero was murdered by the villain and his crew cause the villain wanted the girl for himself. the hero thru the power of his love returns to exact revenge and reclaim his love and teach her to be strong enough to stand up for herself even though she too is scared of packard and it's also about the love of a brother and his last gift to him
3,Movie from my past,"I thought this was a great movie back in the day, but now it seems fair. It is worth a watch but to me not worth buying at full price."
2,Lacking,Something just feels missing about this whole story. You are just seeing events that only barely make any sense. Too much is left un-explained. The acting and cinematography are sub-standard.Just not a good movie.The Car looks cool though.
4,Charlie Sheen: He's fit to be a Superhero....,"What can I say? This is a classic film! It's got an incredible car,that would put the cars from Fast and the Furious to shame, a great villain, a hottie Sherilyn Fenn (Boxing Helena/Fire Walk with Me), and a super hero (Charlie Sheen) that can't be killed because he is already dead! Sorry ladies, Mr. Sheen is apart of the vehicle, never to sport a ""little black book"" again..."
2,Ugh,"Even though it was the 80's, this movie is horrid. That's an hour and half of my life I'll never get back."
2,So Stupid it hurts,"This movie is a scif""ish"" car racing movie. Poor character development, horrible acting, totally illogical actions taken by characters, and the pace of the plot make this movie a complete dud.The car racing sequences are the highlights of the film, and (for the time) the racing, explosions, and effects were pretty good.Overall I don't recommend."
2,Repetitive Patterns.,"Viewed: 9/11Rate: 49/11: Yeah, The Wraith...I remember it from the old days of HBO. It is the black car that survived every time in a race after the loser heads for an inevitable crash. I wanted to view the movie again and see if it got better over time. Sadly, no. The plot, albeit a very interesting one, is very minimal, and it gets real boring after getting know the characters for a few minutes. Then, the same pattern repeats until each of them is dead. Same goes for the scenes. It's just a cycle of races with a different character and a different car each time. The result is as predictable as it gets. And that's about it of the movie. Charlie Sheen is lucky to escape the film because he had the best character that was mysterious and intriguing who happened to have the best looking car. Sherilyn Fenn isn't so bad herself playing as Keri Johnson. Poor Randy Quaid, what is he doing in it? All in all, The Wraith is a one-time flick that had a lot of promise."
3,The wraith,1986 chessy movie but if you are into turbo dodges of that era this movie is for you. The PPG pace car is powered by a 398 hp Chrysler 16v 2.2 twin turbo ..... mid engine formation.Gutterboy cracks me up!
3,looking for soundtrack,"good movie, better soundtrack. anyone who knows wwhere to get it let me know. the soundtrack that is."
4,Classic 80's SciFi movie....,"I hadn't seen this movie in 20+ years, when I stumbled upon it at Amazon I just had to have it. It's not a B movie but it isn't big budget either. I enjoy it as much today as I did over two decades ago. Charlie Sheen, Sherilyn Fenn and Randy Quaid are SO young in this movie (I was too back then). It's a fun flashback for me but being a good movie any age should enjoy it."
4,"""80's Classic!""","Charlie Sheen, Nick Cassavetes, Sherilyn Fenn and RandyQuaid star in this 1986 sci-fi film. A mysterious strangertakes his revenge on a vicious gang. I've always likedthis film, it's a good love story and Nick is great asvillain, Packard Walsh. This dvd has nice picture andsound plus some neat extras. I recommend this 80'sclassic."
3,Entertaining Auto Flick,"I cannot say this is a ""good"" movie, but it is certainly entertaining. I found it years ago in VHS format and bought it because it was about cars (I collect any movie about cars). Most of the acting is pretty bad, and the story is pretty predictable, but I still enjoyed it. I recently bought the new DVD version and I find I still enjoy it. I know the Wraith car is just a VW kit car, but it doesn't matter, I still enjoy watching the ""Wraith"" coming back to kill the ""Bad guys"". Listen to the extras and you will be amazed the movie is as good as it is. This was definitely a VERY low budget effort, but they did a great job."
5,"The Wraith, Beauty In 80's Movie",The Wraith has been one of my favorite movies for about 20years. I have several copies on DVD and VHS. I was completely floored when I found out that there was a Special Edition coming out with Director Commentary and subtitles because there has always been parts in the movie where I have no clue what Skank and Gutterboy are talking about. Plus Mike Marvin gives a lot of interesting information on the movie. I was totally thrilled learning things I did not know about my favorite movie. It was phenomenal. Now they just need to re-release the soundtrack.
3,"""The Wraith"" Review","The ultimate cheesy 80's car race picture has Charlie Sheen as the new kid in town who ends up having problems with a drag-racing gang led by Nick Cassavettes in all of his overacting glory. The gang, who has been terrorizing the local motorists, end up having to deal with another visitor, a supernatural vigilante with a futuristic super car. Throw in Randy Quaid as the angry town sheriff and Clint Howard as the gang's braniac cheerleader and you have good idea of what you're in store for with this underrated B-movie gem. The soundtrack which features music from Ozzy Osbourne, Robert Palmer, and others is the film's bread-n-butter."
3,Decent PPV,"This dvd had an amazing main event, Cage VS Joe but the rest of the PPV was alright. Sting VS Abyss was probably the second best match on the card but the ending was a bit of a stretch. I think scaffold matches are boring, so Rhino VS Styles really wasnt all that great for me. Angle and Steiner is an average match that could have been seen in WWE a few years back, expect for the six sided ring. Ghetto Brawl was a going alright until the end when all the ""gang"" members entered and started to brawl. The bonus matches are great too."
5,Pretty Slick Pouch,"I use this for my .357 rounds, the pouch is pretty well built and tough for leather. Though, it is leather so it will scratch pretty easily but that's not something I care about. I use this pouch when I dress for work.My Speedloaders are HKS made also, six-shot loaders. They don't rattle too much, if you were to run you'd hear them bounce around but if you're walking it won't annoy you. Also, the belt loop is very tight. The width that it allows for belts prevents it from moving up and down your belt. It's very comfortable even when you're sitting also (whether at work or driving). Overall, this is a damn good speedloader pouch. I have no complaints so far.Just remember the part about the leather, they will get scuffed up eventually - just like good shoes. Polish!"
4,Super Case!,This product is exactly like the one I used 28 years ago when I first became involved in law enforcement. The shipping was quick - Thanks! BR
4,Made out of synthetic,"I was expecting a leather speed loader case, no material was listed. Seems well made, fits Safariland speed loaders ok, they sit low in the case but shooulg work fine."
5,Functional and pleasing to the eye.,"I got this case in order to hold the HKS medium sized speed loaders for my Taurus .44 Tracker. It fits the loaded speed loaders very well with a nice look from the synthetic leather, and a secure button closure. I also have a leather speed loader case by Galco and this one does fit them more securely, though I like them both. This was also only a fraction of the price and I would recommend it if you do plan on having some speed loaders."
1,it seems like every ipod breaks within a few months,"I was warned about the potential and seemingly inevitable crashing of the ipod, but i didnt listen. lo and behold, 4 months later the thing freezes up every time i try to upload my music. it is still covered under the warranty, but it is such a hassle, and i am afraid that as soon as the warranty expires, i'll be screwed"
2,RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The thing I find the most wrong with this is the rip off on the marketable pricing. I find it quite hard to belive that this device is priced at 300 bucks for only 10000 songs. You can get a more durable just as cool looking rio mp3 player for 150 bucks (half the price) that can yes hold 10000 songs. Sure it doesnt havve the all cool click weel that everybody likes but who cares go to the hood and look at peoples spinners for crying out loud. I gave this item 2 stars because it can play games. Yes I will admit that is pretty cool but I would of given it 5 stars If it had only been 175 bucks or something. But anywaysPEACE OUT FOOLS!!!!!!!! :) ha ha ha
1,One Year,okay you buy this i pod and its good. great sound. nice look and very easy to use but the battery. one year and it wont charge. so if every year you have $100 and wait a week or two you will get a new battery. Really not a bad product but after every year 100 NO . oh yeah is you use this i pod everyday you will buy a battery every 6 to 8 months not a year so that is no good. a great mp3 player but 1 small thing makes it want to make you think twice about buying .
3,ipod,who have been nice to know wat generation ipod it wasi though it was a 4 it turned out to be a 3
5,The best item money can buy,"Let me just inform all those ppl that complain of freezing and just random problems like that. It never happens i checked with amcontosh and apple and both say they have only a couple out of 100,000 ipods wiht problems. I baught mine and the battery life is great. the sound is awsome. IT DOESN""T SCRATCH IF U R CAREFULL.and the click wheel is awsome. It is pricey though so be careful with it and don't complain when you drop it and it never works again. i hate it when something stupid happens like that and they have to sue the company for such prblems.BUY IT NOW"
1,Reconditioned IPod,"I was REALLY worried to spend a couple hundred dollars for a used electronic item, but it turned out to be foundless. It does not even appear to be used, and is in perfect working order. It was also delivered exactly as promised.Addendum - Unfortunately, it did not last more than a few months. Very disappointing after all."
5,Excellent Purchase,I bought an iPod at the Target store that I work at and I love the thing. I had an old Archos MP3 player that didn't even update itself. This is so easy to use and charges so fast that you don't even have to think about it. Get one...
1,The Ipod Is Useless,I put some of my music in the ipod. First day fine second day fine. Then on the third day this is what happens. Whilst updating the ipod something goes wrong. All of a sudden I just lose all my music. Dont buy the ipod. It is junk. Luckily it has one year warranty. So im getting my money back. A lot of the people I know have ipod's. A lot of their ipod's break too. Don't waste your money on teh ipod. Get a Sony Walkman Mp3 Player or something. Don't make my mistake.
3,20Gb iPod Used,"The screen does not turn off and was most likely the reason it was sold. It works well musically but it is hard to read because light has all but burned out the letters. It is a good back up and was a good price, but I am a disappointed."
2,Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead,"If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you... give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look. I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead. A sound decision and a happy customer right here!I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :)They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod... and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET... oh yeah, even audio books, anything! It's a plug n play device, recognized as MASS STORAGE DEVICE on any windows xp computer. No need to install the iTunes."
2,Not worth the money,"My Ipod never worked correctly, and when I tried to send it back they said the warranty was void because of a few microscopic dents in the casing. They wanted $255 plus tax for repair. How are you not going to get wear and tear on a product meant for being on the go?"
1,waste of money,"I bought my first ipod 10 months ago. Toward the end, the battery life slowly got shorter and shorter, until finally it wouldn't even turn on. I called apple, and the said they would replace it for $30 shipping. Fair enough. I mailed the ipod to them, 5 days later, i got a ""new"" ipod. Opened the box, charged the player, and what do i see? The EXACT same error message! I called apple, VERY upset, and they informed me there was nothing they could do unless i purchased the ""apple service care pack"" for like $60!! I was irate!This product is worthless. Apple customer care is worthless. PLEASE do research before you purchase this product, there are many other better players, it's not worth it to be ""in style"". I had to learn the hard way."
3,instruction manual and battery charge?,"I want to say that my iPod came to me perfectly and perhaps it did, except the instruction manual I received was in French (and I can't read French yet), so I haven't made time to find out how I can find out how to use the darn thing. I figured out some of it on my own but I'm still a little lost. At first I thought the battery wasn't holding a long charge, but now I think it may be ok. But since I have been unable to really use it since I don't know how as yet, I don't know for sure... I would rate it high if those two concerns were out of my mind. Everything else about it looks and feels like it's probably a good product and company ???"
5,LOVE IT,Super deal on my IPOD. Timely delivery...and I love the product. Thank you thank you THANK YOU!!
2,it's great....when it actually works.,"i'm currently on my fifth iPod. i've gone through three in just the past month alone. i keep getting a ""disc error"" message and the iPod is rendered unusable. twice the iPod has not worked coming straight out of the box - again, disc error.also, iTunes has crashed numerous times on my computer. when trying to uninstall iTunes my audio drivers have been corrupted. because of this i have had to reinstall the factory software on my computer twice. iTunes requires too many resources for it's intended purpose. iTunes apparently has issues with large music libraries - crashing and freezing.if you are purchasing this product and have the option to buy an extended warranty, i would seriously recommend it.despite my continuing problems with this product, i enjoy using it."
3,Definitely much better players around,"Positive:+ Cool navigation and cool Click Wheel+ Great Sound And Earbuds+ 2.0 USB+ Supports AAC, WAV, AIFF, and much more+ Digital Calendar (yeah, hard to believe)+ GamesNegative:- Only 12 Hours Battery Life- Overly Expensive- Awful Tech Support, $50 Per Call, WTF?- No Photo Viewing- No FM Tuner or FM Recording- No Voice Recording- Okay, Flat Out...No Recording...No TunerI've seen better. Check out the Samsung, Creative, and iRiver players for a better experience. Spend your money elsewhere!"
3,Ipod.. ??,"interface well, itunes and all is quite idiot proof until youhave multiple computer to download songs and the Ipod is a nightmare. you cannot drag and drop songs like normal MP3 player but everything ahve to go thru Itunes ! if you have songs in your Ipod .. you have to jump thru hoops to download it to another computer or vise versa! It interface well if you have a simple setup but for advance ameature on computers ! this can be a little fiasty when you need to do more advance stuff.!DaveC"
2,"Innovative, but the sound is terrible","I was so happy the day my Ipod came in the mail I could hardly contain myself. I had scooped it up at a great deal ($210), and when it finally arrived, i couldnt wait to upload my collection. To make a long story short, I got about 2 cds worth on it before turning it around and selling it. The fact that it holds 10000 (approx) songs on it is amazing, but the sound is awful. The high end is terrible, and the bass doesn't exsist, not to mention the volume control doesn't go up high enough (at top volume, I can still hear everything around me). I tried replacing the earbubs with something more highend, but no luck. The sound was still too low. If you're not an audiophile (like me), then Ipod might work for you, but I dont like my music to sound hollow and crappy. What a waste of $$$. Kudos to apple for coming up with something so innovative, but for the love of god, DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE SOUND. I've heard better from cassettes, no lie."
1,Nice doorstop,"My first 4th gen. IPod stopped working after nine months - the harddrive gave up the ghost. Apple was nice enough to replace the IPod with a new one. This one stopped working after another 4 months. Harddrive failure, again. This time it was out of warranty, and I'm SOL. What a POS. But hey, for a $10-of-materials-made-in-China-doorstop, it looks purty."
2,Why the iPod is not that good,"The iPod is hard to use and it's complicated. Why do you have to use itunes to put music on it? Plus when i plug my iPod to another computer, rather than mine, iTunes says this "" you iPod is linked to another itunes library"" and then it deletes all the music and playlists in the iPod. Another thing is that after using it for 3 months it started to function incorrectly, it became slow and in then it stopped powering."
1,To bad it can't be 0 stars,okay don't buy this it's a piece of crap!!!!You can't change the battery your self and its extremly fragile and over priced.
1,piece of crap,"ipods are useless peices of junk i have gone through 4 in the past 7 months one the ""wheel"" stoped working, another the screen kept what was on its display even when you changed screens and repeated the procces till it was just a mess of black lines, the third would jump though random parts of a song and then randomly jump to a different song and the 4th did the same thing. itunes is decent some other things battery life is about 6-8 hours not 12 and they scratch extremely easily and i had 1 v3 and 3 v4 version ipods i would recommend a sony network walkman it is supior in every way"
2,WHat does this iPOD come with????,"This isn't really a review but to just point out the fact that the product listing doesn't tell me what this iPOD comes with!!!! My friend bought his iPod from Amazon through Circuit City and it was great. I want to do the same, however before I hit that ""Proceed with Order"" button I want to know what I am buying! Does this iPod come with a remote, earbuds, USB cable, and a dock??? My friend's did. Maybe someone will see this and list the products accessories."
5,I love ipod,"I love my ipod. I had a collection of about 300 or so cd's and now instead of lugging around big cd wallets I just have my ipod. Simplifies everything. If you use it constantly like I do then the battery has to be charged pretty regular but it is completely worth it. I use this more than I use my phone, tv, or anything else."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$!!!!!!!,"OK first off don't get me wrong, the ipod is an pretty neat piece of equipment. But it has one major flaw. The battery it uses (a lithiom ion) is neat because it's rechargable. But the ipods battery dies out after about a year. which really sucks considering that you pay $250 -$300 for one, and it only lasts for a year."
2,hard to use on two computers,"Apple has made the use of the ipod on more than one computer nearly impossible for the person who doesn't want to spend their weekends figuring out it's nuances. I use it primarily for audiobooks. Here's the catch. My high speed net connection is at my office computer which doesn't have a cd player. My cd collection is uploaded to my home computer with a dialup connection. I download my audiobooks at the office and put them on the ipod. I go home and the ipod won't connect to my home computer. After several days and trips back and forth from the office, I thought I had it figured out. But I just tried to reconnect the ipod to my office computer again. Guess what- won't let me do."
1,Don't waste your money...,"This is made to be replaced in two years. You can't replace the battery, which will lose most of it's charge capacity in a year or two, without sending it off to Apple and paying 2/3 the new purchase price."
3,"Love it, then it quits working","Great product when it works. However, after about 14 months of use it totally quit working. My brother-in-law had the exact same problem as me after about 12 months of use. He called Apple, they allowed him to buy an extended warranty (late, $40), shipped it back to Apple and they are in the process of repairing/replacing it. He spent over 1 1/2 hour on the phone with them, however. Great product, but too expensive if Apple is planning on them having a 12-14 month life."
4,Ipod is great but it takes a little work,"Just bought the IPOD 20GB yesterday and I have to tell youthe good and bad with this little jukebox. First the badthe device would not connect to my USB 2.0 computer to save my life. After calling and using your one-time free call to Apple support (or lack thereof) they told me one helpful piece of advice. That is when your ipod is properly connected a red circle with a line through it saying ""Do not disconnect"" will appear on the ipod.The only way I could get this to work was to go to CompUSA andbuy an Adaptec 4300 firewire card and ipod compatible firewire cable and like magic the ipod works flawlessly.The music quality is astoundingly good and as far as all the reviews go this is the best advice I can give. If you areable to treat it like a newborn baby or a frail old man withkid gloves than you should be ok with it. So far so goodI do recommend it because it can act as an external hard drive as well for backups and things like that. Enjoy!!"
1,This Is Not That good Of an Ipod,You know that now the Ipods are in color and play videos and are not in black and white I think you should sell the black and white Ipod and buy one that plays videos and holds photos and ETC...
3,meh,"scratched and worn, sometimes doesnt turn on and off well. could have a radio, that would be nice. other than that, its really nothing special."
2,This is a 4G iPod,"4G means 4th generation, not to be confused with the 4GB iPod Mini. This is the 20GB model that just came out in July. It's sold by J&R in New York. They are pretty slow in shipping out products, so watch out. This is the latest model available, but a lot of users prefer the older 3G version."
3,"Great product, frustrating service","I love the iPod. That's the easy part. Carry around easily all of your CDs: what's not to like? Unfortunately, it is worth knowing that true love doesn't always run true: nor do iPods. When you get the little triangle symbol and can't resolve it, you will be instructed to mail your beloved ipod back. At that point, BEWARE, you will be sent back another refurbished unit, NOT NEW. Here's my sad tale: three times I've mailed my 'pod back in one year. After the second time Apple said the next time I would get a new unit. Now, however, they say it will be another time. So, Apple service gets 4 strikes. I'd look at other options in MP3s."
3,"When it works, I love it...","I bought an ipod 20 gig and it was working nicely. I was able to download songs, transer cds and so on. The next day I tried to sync the pod to my PC and nothing happened. The battery was showing that it was being charged but my PC wouldn't recognize the pod. I took it back to where I purchased it and they could not get it to sync with their computer. They gave me a new one. This time I was a bit skeptical. Once I fully charged my pod, I could sync it to my pc and transfer music to it. I was happy. Fast forward 6 days and I am trying to sync my pod to my pc and the same issue is happening. I can't do anything to get my pc to recognize that the pod is connected. I need to return this one and try my hand at one last pod. If you buy an ipod, make sure the return policy is good and you also buy the extended warranty."
5,AWESOME-!!,"The Ipod 20 GB is really the best thing ive bought in a while. I saved for EVER to get one, and I am NOT dissapointed. It is way easy to use, and unlike many reviews say, the battery life does LAST the 12 hours its suppose to last. You just charge it up every day before you go to bed, its that easy. The Ipod also has this really cool game: It will begin playing a song, for about 5-8 seconds. You will be givin 5 songs to choose from, and in those 5-8 seconds you have to click on that song before the time runs out. Its a really cool game even if it sounds dumb in writing. The shuffle songs on the Ipod is great, its like having a radio in your pocket. The one thing is, if your giong to get an Ipod, GET A CASE BEFORE YOU BUY THE IPOD. I mad the mistake of not getting a case and now theres some scratches on my Ipod. Nothing to bad, but still, a case is needed to keep your Ipod in top shape"
3,good until it died,"I bought this iPod a year and a half ago and was extremely pleased with it until about a month ago when it started to make funny noises and failed to play at some times. When it broke down entirely last week, I did everything the website asked, wiping all my music files from it and everything, and instead of getting better, the iPod would now not even start up anymore. Since it was a few months over the warranty expiration date, the price apple charged for fixing it was as much as buying a new iPod.Since I do not have enough money to buy a new iPod every year, which seems to be what is expected of users, I looked into other MP3 players and made sure to buy an extended warranty when I found one."
4,Pretty Cool,"My first ipod. Bought for a friend actually, but got to test thoroughly before giving it. Its pretty good although I am yet to fully get used to itunes because the manual updating of songs can get a bit tiresome. Otherwise pretty good.Update: The ipod is still going strong after 4 months of use. Although newer models are out I got this one for a great price. Definitely worth the buy."
5,"Works great, just a small problem","There's a black spec on the inside of my screen that's driving me absolutely insane..I can't get rid of it.With it being brand new I would like it to be in better condition, I will call Apple and talk to them to see what they say.Other than that, it's an iPod, it works very well and lasts much longer than my old audio player. Thumbs up."
4,I love it and use it all the time!,"I had it for two weeks and I put a PDA screen protector on the screen immediately, and I scratched it by cleaning it with a SOFT COTTON T shirt. Now I will buy a case for it. The battery don't last 12 hours, just 4 or 5. Other than these issues, I love it and use it all the time!"
1,Hate It,"I have had problems from the beginning with this iPod; it freezes up for no reason, stops in the middle of a song whenever it feels like it, and occasionally will not shut off-- I have to wait until the battery dies before I can (hopefully) use it again."
1,Ipod Died,"I purchased an Ipod 20GB for my wife for her birthday at Best Buy. The whole time I was looking at the item the salesman qept talking about exteded service warranty. He stated that he recomended them because they do get some Ipods returned within a year with bad batteries. I figured this was a sales pitch and bought mine with out the extra warrnty. To make a lon story short, the Ipod died within the first week we had it. Just prior to it dying the battery charge indicator showed the battery nearly full. What ever the cause, all repairs unless under warranty are very pricy!! Buy with caution!!!!! We returned ours for a refund."
4,iPod RULES!!!,"I found this a great product, maybe a little expensive but worth it!!! It is extremely conveniant. But the bad parts are:-the earphones hurt without the black covers which fall of a lot-even though i got the iPod socks i had to take it out to play and it got all smudgy and scratched, which is why the iPod skins would be useful-if you dont have the patience to download 5000 songs (or if u only know 1000 or less songs) you should get the iPod mini-i wish it came in colors like the iPod mini, and also the iPod mini doesn't get scratched as easily"
5,Simply the best.,"The Apple iPod is simply the best choice for anyone living a digital lifestyle. Fit, form and function soar above the competition. Should be on everyone's Christmas Wish List for 2004. I use mine for music, calendars, todo lists, reminders, alarms, backups, and carrying files to read in the Target check-out line."
2,It is kind of a scam,"The first thing that bothered me was that I had to buy this mp3 player (its the most expensive for no real reason) because nothing else would work with the iTunes songs I purchased.The second thing that bothered me was that it would occasionally freeze even when it was brand new, nothing too serious though.Lastly, a few months after my warrenty expired the Ipod broke by itself, it erased my songs with an ""error"" displayed on the computer and now freezes iTunes all the time. Restoring it or anything does nothing and getting it repaired would cost more than a new one. Considering what good care I took of it, this really bothers me."
2,Good But Not Great,"The iPod may be the best in Mp3 players and so forth but if your like an average individual like me, who's going to have 5000 songs? Other players aren't so big and heavy (the iPod is not heavy but heavier compared to other Mp3 players). I know the iPod can do more then just have Mp3 and AAC files, hold data, do all that stuff, but I just used to for Mp3's. If your just using it for music, I suggest a different player. I have the Rio Nitrus 1.5 GB and I think it holds the perfect amount. But that's just my opinion."
2,Can't replace battery,I don't have the latest iPod but my current iPod's had to be sent back to the factory to get a new battery. Why can't you replace the battery yourself? I don't know if this is fixed in the latest generation of iPods but I'm not going to pay for a new one to find out.
1,Still hasn'r shipped after 212 hours,"Amazon CLAIMS that this item ""Usually ships within 24 hours"" 9 days after ordering my ipod has STILL NOT SHIPPED. I would like to know what Amazons definition of ""Usually"" is; maybe it depens on what the definition of ""is"" is. Maybe next time I'll buy from the Apple store."
2,iPod=initial price over-dose,"Thought to buy one. Checked it out first. Was lucky . . . my son got one. I got in on the evaluation. Looks are deceiving. Mega problems for the price. Normal humans can't replace the battery. Can't download in any fashion but Itunes. Only MP3--no WMA. Attracts attention of criminals as well as envy and admiration. Kinda like computers, the iPod, in that, they got you coming and going--sell you the poorly performing device, then sell you the fix of the device. Keep you in their pocket--can play only from their Itunes, better performance on MAC than PC. iPod developers made better plan for hooking up the consumers than providing a reliable product. Expensive disposable device it is. Therefore, buy cheaper disposable MP3 player, spend the difference on beer. Great idea, the iPod, but poor ""performance"" testing."
3,"used to love it, growing to hate it","i-tunes is unpredictable, and so my i-pod has become a source of stress. will my playlists be there when I synch up? will my library file become corrupt? will songs I purchase get transferred to my i-pod? I never know what's going to happen when I dock my i-pod, but I can usually count on a new i-pod or i-tunes software download and what should be a quick and enjoyable session managing my music library always - ALWAYS - turns into a hassle. I'm getting the Rio Carbon."
3,6 Month Summary,"After using the 20gig iPod for 6 months now I am disappointed with the battery performance. I commute via train into the city for work. It is 1 hour inbound and 1 hour outbound. I use my iPod on the train for a total of 2 hours a day. I start the week with a full charge, yet I need to charge again by Thursday when I get home. That is only 8 hours of playing time. My iPod is typically set to shuffle and I have the shortest backlight display time set (5 seconds). I rarely ever mess with the thing while it is playing (thereby avoiding the backlight and excessive power use).At the rate of this battery depletion I will soon be needing to charge it every day. This is unacceptable and highly disappointing. Therefore I am removing 2 stars from the review. Everything else is great about the player, however it will soon become a useless paperweight and landfill waste due to poor battery."
3,"iPod a good player, but make sure your battery is covered!!!","I just want to warn people about the batteries on the iPods. these are rechargable batteries, which cannot be swapped in and out like normal batteries. This means that if something goes wrong, your out of luck.This is what happened to mine. I had a 20GB iPod, only a year old. Then the battery dies. It doesnt charge, turn on, anything. So I called Apple, told them the problem, and they gave me a price to have it fixed : $278. I said, ""Excuse me?""Some people say Best Buy has a battery protection plan, so I recommend going there and investing in it. Dont think it cant happen to you, because thats exactly what I thought now I'm out another $260."
3,Works,Well I won't say that I don't like this product but it took this product awhile to charge but once it is fully charged it works great. I mainly got it for a workout device and I will be upgrading it to a newer generation Ipod for my traveling needs.
2,Be careful buyer!!!,"I bought this IPOd thru AMAZON WAREDOUSE deal. It is good but not compatible with my AV RECEIVER. I tried to return it right away but they block the system on me and I couldn't do it. So, be careful to check out every feature of the IPOD you pan to buy because they would not let you return it. It's a bitter experience for ON LINE BUSINESS. They say so but they wouln't do so !! Be careful !!!!!!!"
1,"cheap, too many problems","bought this mp3 player 5 years ago, it used its own usb cable instead of mini-usb, had an internal battery/memory so it was unable to be updated . it uses a software called ""itunes"" Meaning you have to install that bulky software to do anything with this mp3 device. when i bought it was over 400 dollars. by 13 months of little use, the battery stopped holding charge, i called apple, the company that makes this device, they said theres nothing they can do, as the battery is designed only to last within the warranty period. wasted 400 dollars, better off donating that moneymy 11 year old diamond mp3 player had more options and was better built.do not buy apple products!!i rated poor ease of use because you have to use itunes"
1,Unit is fragile and warranty is void if case has a dent,Had the ipod for a few months. During normal wear and tear (device being put in bags with other things like work out clothes and such) and inside a leather case the rear panel of the device got a small dent in the center and it stopped working. Tried to return it under warranty but was told would cost $270 due to physical damage. They need to make these more resilient. I don't worry about dropping my cell phone or my cell phone being squished in my backpack but apparently the ipod is very fragile.
1,Beware,"During several months ipod was wonderful.However, now, it is useless. Battery has problem, and software and hardware do not work well.If you do not have warranty, you should be careful to buy this. Oh my god, I have spent over $300 to buy it last year. I am wonder how should they can sell this stupid gadget."
1,Froze up after 3 months of use,"Bought this for my son as a December 2005 holiday gift. Now it's frozen and useless. He wants me to exchange it, so I'm looking into that. From what I've heard and read, Apple views this as a disposable. Personally, I'm turned off by Apple's arrogance, but my son bought into their hype.My advice: buy from another manufacturer."
2,Hard drive failed,"I own the 40 GB ipod, I loved it and vowed never to go back to CDs. It worked great for about six months then began skipping songs while playing. Unfortunately I tried to resolve the issue myself, then had several months worth of personal problems, then tried to resolve myself again. Now it's out of warranty, has failed completely. I'm told by the techs that it's the hard drive and cannot be fixed.Moral - if you have trouble, go ahead and try to reset /restore but do it quickly and if there's still any sign at all that the ipod is having problems send it back. It wastes precious time trying to do it yourself while under warranty."
1,Buy the apple care protection!,"I will say this, I loved my iPod, it WAS a great little device. When I purchased it I passed on the Apple care protection, figuring those are usually a waste of money. In this case it should be a requirement. Before making a purchase of an iPod, keep in mind what will happen if it fails after your warranty has expired. Apple will not repair it. You send them your old iPod and $255 + tax and they send you a used iPod with a 90 day warranty. So basically your best option is to throw the iPod away and buy a new one. So much for the legendary Apple support.If you still think the iPod is a good deal after adding the $60 Apple care protection plan, then by all means go for it because it is a great little player, but make sure you get that protection plan. My hard drive failed 2 weeks after the warranty expired and the best thing I can do with it now is let my son take it apart to see what's inside."
2,Not worth the price,the iPod isn't worth its price. It took 3 hours to get the iPod to work with my computer and then it took another hour to load the songs. Later the iPod was currupted and needed to be formatted again! The iTunes services are garbage they don't have the selection like napster. Check out the Dell Jukebox and Napster you'll be happier.
1,Way too Expensive for its Features- Get an Archos Gmini 400,"I've owned the ipod for 8 months now, and i realized that this unit is too expensive for its features. The only thing this Ipod can do is for listening to music. I am now looking onto the Archos Gmini 400, which has memory card reader, photo, video, music, and gameplay all in one for a little less than 50 bucks more than the 20 gig ipod. This Ipod is way too expensive for the petty features. Get the Archos Gmini 400 instead. People who buy the ipod only ""judge a book by its cover"" and are later being jipped of the ipod's premium price. Like other reviewers said ""gimini is the ultimate ipod killer."""
1,DON'T BUY ANY ITEMS FROM AMAZON.COM,I bought an apple ipod from amazon.com but there is a problem in ipod so i returned it but they give me only 80% refund instead of 100%. and their customer service didnot giving any answer to me. so don't buy any items from amazon...
2,Buyer Beware,I just want everyone to know that if anything happens to your Ipod that is not a manufacturers defect Apple will not repair it at any price.As expensive as they are if anything goes wrong you might as well throw it away as Apple wont fix it.They are very fragile. Till something breaks they are very nice though.
4,some good Ipods and some are bad,"I got my I pod a year ago and I had alot of crap go rong with it from freezes on me to just strate die, Lucky for me I had a three year warranty, I got at bestbuy trust me I think half of the ipods are not perfected and all of them are over priced yet,I returned it like three times befor thay fix it, o ya on a note if it freezs on you just hold the midle boton and the menu at the same time for 10 to 15 sec and its fix, I love it just wish the batery was removble thanks for the read."
5,iPod 4th Generation Rocks!,I am in love. I got my iPod about a month ago and i absolutly love it. it is fantastic. i cant put it down! thats all i have to say!!its great! buy one! you will not regret it!
1,BAD PRODUCT,I was very upset with this product as there was a defect in the item.Also the onlines provided maximum discomfort by not printing the label.All in all it was a bad buy and I am extremely unhappy !!!
1,A failure,"After 3 weeks Itunes is not recognizing the IPOD anymore. When I use the updater to retsore factory settings I get a message ""Firmware update failure. Disk Write Error. It sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"iPod Rocks, But not that much","I bought an click wheel iPod a month ago, it's a really cool device, built with an excelent quality and great looks, BUT, battery life really sucks, i tried everything to make it last just a little bit longer, like putting all the songs that i'm goig to listen to in the same playlist, so the ipod won't have to fill it's cache, but still it will go dead in about 5hrs.***I hope the next generation iPod will come with a next generation battery life as well, i would also be good to use bluetooth technology to syncronize with iPod."
1,Short life span,"I do not recommend Apple's Ipod and IF you are going to buy one, get the extended warranty. Over the past 3.5 years, I have owned three Ipods and all three died with the same problem after about a year....the well known folder with the exclamation mark. At first it is fixable by restoring or resetting the device, but then the hard dive siezes up and you have a paper weight. I have done this three times because I own all the accessories including by beloved Bose docking station.If you doubt my warning here, just check out Apple's Ipod support page on their web site. Right on the first page are the infamous icons that you will dread to see on Ipod (if you buy one). Also check out the support discussion board.You've been warned."
1,Corrupt!,"My 32 GB ipod touch first generation died after 4 or 5 years of use, and I was in a need for a quick fix since I was going to be going on a lot of road trips. I decided to go for this because it would be cheaper and would hold a lot of (but not all of) my music. But when I was attempting to charge/sync the ipod and set it up and everything it would just beep at me and it said it was corrupt. I sent it back. Luckily they gave me a full refund."
5,Nice,"Great place to keep all of your CD's! I only have 755 songs at this time, and the IPOD will play continuously for 1.7 days without repleating a song! And I'm only using 2.6 GB! Easy to use--nice player!"
3,Ipod - Epensive and cheap,"Despite how expensive the Ipod is, its still cheaply built. You know how you can buy those really nice portable CD players, or those really sucky ones? Well, the Ipod is like a really sucky MP3 player, but its the best there is so far. Here are some of the major problems I've had with mine:1. Sometimes, for no reason, it stars getting clunky and then just freezes.2. Sometimes when I pick a track, it doesn't play, and just goes through the tracls, and then it freezes.3. The battery lasts about three hours, and it takes about 4 hours to charge back up.4. Sometimes when I play a track sound only comes from one earphone, gets distorted, or something like that, and the only way to fix it, is to hit it real hard.5. When I turn it up to a louder volume, the bass makes the earbuds buzz.6. It cost me 299 dollars, and it cost aplle 11 dollars to make."
1,rest in peace,"I had purchased an iPod about a month and a half ago, and it's dead already; it just stopped working!! I haven't dropped it at all, and it's been in my purse the entire time. Nothing has happened to this product for it to just cease playing (unless you count playing the songs)...I might be in a small percentage of people who are displeased with the iPod, but $300 dollars is too much money to spend on something that just stops working..."
2,"Keep this in a glass case, I suppose","Well, this was a very nice little MP3 plater until the other day when it fell about a foot onto a somewhat hard surface, and COMPLETELY BROKE. It didn't fall apart or anything, but it no longer plays any music - it just makes a grinding/clicking noise and freezes when you want it to play a song. And of course, because this is an Apple product, it's completely sealed in its slick little casing, so I can't take it apart to see if I can fix it. If I didn't already have the also overpriced iPod docking station, I wouldn't hesitate to replace it with a completely different brand of MP3 player."
1,When it's battery wears out--it's disposable!!,"I am looking for a good MP3 jukebox for my kid for Xmas. This is not a good one. The litium batter is integrated into the box and can't be changed by the user so the unit is considered disposable. This is a huge engineering error on the part of Apple. Don't buy it. Many other makers such as Gateway, Dell, iRiver, etc that offer 20GB systems for the same price with 16 hours of play time, full color LCDs, photo capability, FM tuners and recording, and of course user replacable batteries. Don't believe it? Download the PDF manual here and search for ""battery"" and discover for yourself. Hope I saved you some trouble."
5,Great,"The ipod is great it doesn't skip you can hold all your cds onthere a calender, and a clock.But the Ipod is very easy to dropI've drop mines a few share of times.And the headphones are badI suggest you get a pair when you get your ipod"
5,kuryakyn iso grips,These grips are not only great looking they were very easy to put on. They have completely eliminated hand cramps while riding. I highly recommend this product.
1,Disappointing product,"These strings were absolutely terrible. When I was installing the strings on my guitar, the string unraveled (not snapped). I have had strings snap on me before, but unraveling shows the product is of poor quality."
3,Good techno story about Shuttle forced landing ramifications,"Written by aerospace engineer, accurate story of main engine failure on polar lanch, deadstick landing (aren't they all) on Easter Island, and subsequent complications. Technically very accurate. Characterization and development least good of Correy's (G. Harry Stine's) books. I liked it."
3,Not tha best choice in a hip-hop compilation,"This comp. is way too varied 4 anyone to really get into it, and most hip-hop fans will have the featured artists' solo jointz if they know what'z up."
3,"Missing last hour in final episode ""Peace With Honor""","While I am generally satisfied with this DVD set - the transfer is of good quality, with no apparent deletion of any material from the original PBS broadcast - potential buyers should be aware that the final episode on the last DVD, ""Peace With Honor"", contains only the first hour of what is a two-hour episode. The final chapters of the war, including the fall of Saigon, are completely missing as a result. This was disappointing to discover, and just seems to be an oversight which was not caught during this set's production."
4,"Missing ""Peace with Honor""...","Just a comment or two....generally I recommend the series of programs documenting the Vietnam War, but it seems the final chapter of the war - the North Vietnamese capture of Saigon was ommited - there's an abrupt editing of the credits, which obviousily interrupts the program - strange that they would market the DVD with possibly sixty minutes missing."
4,Cool Melons Turn To Frogs,"I am a big fan of Issa, and this is a lovely book. I returned this purchase (soft cover) only because I had bought it for a gift, and for a gift, the book just doesn't look as nice in soft cover. The illustrations are gorgeous and look much better in hard cover."
2,Didn't Spend my Money,"Based on what I saw about this book it seems the ""editors?"" ""Authors?"" of this children's book were hybridizing the engenious works of Issa for their own gain.Not that it was conscious but I was searching for a SERIOUS collection of the works of Issa.Yuck."
5,NIce Product.....if you purchase the rigth one!!!!!!!,"HiThis is a very good product, but be sure to purchase the rigth one.The first picture appear here is the product that is not permitted to sell in USA, because it has a lot of substance non permitted.The only one permitted is the one distributed by Johnson Pharmaceuticals. This is the item selling in this listing. Please tell to Amazon that the first picture is not the correct for this item."
2,Mad Dog and Glory,"If this movie did not have Robert DeNiro and Bill Murray in it, you probably wouldn't finish watching it. It's hard to understand how someone would have read the script or seen the rough cut and said ""people are going to come see this."" The plot is standard-issue ""man falls in love with hooker with heart of gold and has to save her from the mafia"" stuff. DeNiro's character is not really likeable and Murray's is overplayed a little, though still fun to watch. If you don't love either of these two actors, skip it."
2,Waiting,"I am still waiting for my order which was already paid (as it appears on my VISA statement): 3 DVD (Mad Dog and Glory, Five Easy Pieces, Tully). I sent a claim to you earlier with no response. Would you please forward this letter to the people in charge? I am really worried. Maurice Elia"
3,Average Cops and Gangsters Vehicle,"When a retrospective of Robert DeNiro's career is done, I seriously doubt this one will be mentioned. It's mildly engaging but slight entertainment. DeNiro seems to be sleepwalking through his role of nerdy cop. Bill Murray does not really stretch himself in the gangster role. We only view him as a menacing presence because the story tells us so. Uma Thurman is adequate in her role of DeNiro's prize for saving Murray's life, but there is nothing here to suggest the range that she showed in later work. Who does distinguish himself is David Caruso as DeNiro's no-nonsense partner. If Caruso were not so self-destructive he could have had a nice career in films. I would have been more impressed with this venture had Martin Scorsese taken the directorial reigns instead of just producing it."
1,Robert De Niro Mr. Nice Guy???,Offbeat to say the least in a film i regret seeing still to this day. De Niro plays a lonely police photographer who saves the life of a mobster(Bill Murray who`s charcter is funny and stupid at the same time)decides to reward his bravery by giving him his girl for a week. But De Niro falls in love with the girl and refuses to let her go thus making the Gangster an unhappy man. Once again de niro tries hard to shake off his gangster image by switching personnas it failed as did the film at the box office. But Uma Thurman is one attractive woman who woulden`t want to fight over her? Her acting talent isn`t much put to good use here and has come a long way since doing this film that didn`t do much for her career at the time.
5,Excellent Explanation of Life,"I found this book over twenty five years ago when my dad was actually weaving on a huge loom that had the foot pedals that you push down to create a weaving design. The book ""The Weaver"" is out of print but can be found if you look hard. I love this book because it is a Navajo Indian's explanation of life compared to a colorful weaving. There are dark times in our lives when we question God but even the bad times, the sad times, the unfortunate times, are all part of everyone's life. In other words, no one has a 100% perfect life even though it may appear that way at times. By comparing the dark times in our lives to the happy, good times, we see that all of it together creates a beautiful life. Great read and very meaningful."
5,awesome record from my favorite deejay,"I was an avid listener of Meredith Ochs' radio show on WFMU until I moved out of the New York area, so I got this CD to hear what she's been up to. Very nice work. Trouble Creek is a little country, a little blues and a lot of rock 'n' roll. Meredith was my favorite deejay because she told edgy and entertaining stories on the air, and her lyrics are the same way -- there's a lot of mystery in them, but they are still accessible. I love her sweet voice, and the band provides excellent accompaniment."
5,An excellent album,After just a couple of listens to this cd I was hooked. I would find myself humming the songs to myself during the day and so I would again pop in the cd. It is truly addicting. A well-crafted album. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys good rock and pop tinged with country. This is a wonderfully unique and talented band that deserves to be heard and enjoyed around the world.I have no hesitation in giving this album 5 stars!
3,unusual comparison,"this album is not what i expected, from reading other reviews. which is not to say that it is bad. it just isn't the bluegrass/acoustic sound that i was led to believe. it is somewhere between countrified-emo and old-school liz phair. although i am going to keep it, rather than trade it at the record exchange, i can tell that it isn't going to be in the cd player often."
4,Mariza - Concert in London,"Technically it is a good recording, if i had to comment on something that didn't satisfied me was the reaction of the public.....quite conservative and ""coolish"" I would have expected more enthusiasm! The guitars, especially the Portuguese are fantastic, they really talk to you, but from my point of view are not enough to do justice, they needed a couple of other instruments. Mariza? always EXTRAORDINAIRE!!Raffael"
3,A funky little B movie but entertaining,I saw this movie in 1987/8 when it was shown on the Canadian pay TV channel and I enjoyed it. It's not a deep or intellectual movie by any stretch of the imagination but it's very entertaining (in a Mad Max kind of way). The fact that most of the movie takes place in the very limited set of the drive-in gets a bit tiresome after a while but all in all it was worth watching.
3,MTV Apocalypse!...,"Do you remember the 80s? Remember MTV? Well, DEAD-END DRIVE IN is every bad MTV music video of that dippy decade, all smooshed together! We get bands of ""punks"" looking for trouble! Mountains of tall, stiff hair! Caked-on make-up! Even a vomit-inducing, 80s ""synth"" soundtrack! Though made in Australia, I kept looking for Billy Idol, Madonna, or Pat Benatar! Amazing! Though dull in several spots, it's just ridiculous / cheeezy enough to keep me awake..."
4,Trippy,"Those Aussie's can do 80's as well as the next guy and they prove it in this one. It don't really come off the total end of the world, but there is some breakdown of acceptable behavior, and some Car fun, stunts and the like."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER!!!,"I saw this movie in the Fresh Meadows, NY movie theater in 1986, I believe. So I was only 15 years old. But I thought this movie was awful and the acting was terrible. I remember some guy asking, ""Where are me bloody wheels?!"" throughout the whole movie. At least I didn't pay for it since we used to break into the theater's back door."
5,"Satisfied Customer of 36"" Gas Range","I ordered my stove over the phone, and spoke with a very professional staff person of Premiere name ""Artie"", and I mention his name because he was of great assistance to me in helping to expedite my order. I placed the order for my stove on Friday 3rd and recieved my stove one week later on Friday 10th.The only thing I did not know at the time of placing my order was that the items/stove was not to be delivered into my home. The driver told me it was to be delivered to the curb of my house out front. I told him that was not acceptable and he must bring it up my five(5) steps into my kitchen and he did with the help of my son-in-law. So be aware of that when ordering from AJ Madison. My stove is beautiful, professional looking and looks great in my kitchen. Also an Engineer charged $225.00 to hook it up. Anyway I am quite satisfied with my purchase. So Happy Shopping Pearl"
4,So fgar so good!,"I bought this to replace an electronic Westminster chime for my new house. Unfortunately, in Hawaii, due to humidity many electronic parts do not last long! So far (fingers crossed) this one seems to work fine."
5,Westminster chimes with a rich tonal quality AND a volume control !!!,"Since we have 3 entrances and standard door bells only accommodate 2 entrances, we had to buy a second, and entirely different, door bell/chime for the main entrance. The hardwired Heath Zenith Westminster chimes proved to be a good choice. The chimes have a rich resonance to them that reverberates throughout the house even on the lowest volume setting, which is where we keep it.Highly recommeneded."
3,worthy effort by EA,This game is a pretty good game. EA did a better job with this then Agent under fire. I would recommend renting this game before you buy it. I've people that said this game was awsome and others that thought it was bad. This doesn't live up to golden eye and Rareware produced much better games then EA. My opinion is that you Should pick up Time Splitters 2 it is Produced by Free Radical (they broke off Rareware and they made Golden Eye)
4,One of the best FPS games,This is one of best fps games I've ever played (excluding Turok).Overall I highly reccomend this game!
2,"Hey men, theres a metroid waiting to be buyd instead o this.","Why should you buy a game thad its 12 levels long???????? (i have this game.. it [inhales with force]), if you can buy Metroid Prime, MP, its long, grphics, are the best ever made, and its enjoyable.Im sayng it to you, dont buy it, its bad, short....... the only good things are graphicas, but for thad, give the thanks to the NGC, not to the game........."
2,"007 Nightfire, What were they thinking!!","Ok, I don't care what everyone says this game in my opinion came up a bit short. Well it does have some strong points like the amazing graphics,but the controls are sooooo sluggish. For example when your running and you turn it will take you ages to finally face the right direction. You'll find yourself dead in about 4 shots and they changed the aiming system, the result isn't to great.I mean is it possible that EA will ever make a good bond game??"
5,Great Game,"I purchased 007 Nightfire to play on the Wii. It's great fun, just like I remember from the old N64. For the price, you cant beat having an old classic to play. I purchased this right before the new GoldenEye was released, and with the mixed reviews, I'm not sure if I should get the new game or not."
3,"Great game, but very short","NightFire is definetly the best 007 game EA Games has ever made, but it still is not as good as GoldenEye(okay, the grahpics stank, but it was an N64 game.) The multi-player is great, and the levels for it are really good. You don't have the custom guns select anymore, but it's still good. One-player is great, but to the experienced gamer, it's very easy. I've had the game for about a week now, and I've beaten the game. I can see some of the levels being fun to play over and over again. The levels are not quite as long as I'd like them to be either. There are only 12 levels too, which is hardly any. GoldenEye had 20 long, dfficult missions. Multi-player won't get boring for a while though. There are about 8 scenarios, and I haven't played them all yet! Bottom line: Buy the game only if you play lots of the multi-player. If you just want to play one-player, rent it; you'll beat it in a week."
4,Nightfire is Sweet,"Nightfire is an awesome game. It's really cool because you can pick any gun that you have picked up. My favorite gun would have to be the tactical sniper because it has an excellent scope so you can shoot guys from hundreds of feet away. I also like the sentinel. It's sort of like a rocket launcher but you can guide it. The only bad thing in this game is that guys can shoot you through metal doors using a hand gun. And the other bad thing is that the game goes by too fast. For you good gamers out there this will go too fast for you because some missions are real easy, but others are real challenging. This game has excellent graphics and sound. The storyline is also great. I wouldn't rent it first I'd just go and buy it. This game is awesome and for you gamers out there who like James Bond this is the game for you. Four and a half stars."
3,Decent,"I found this game to be a little monotonous after a while. At first it seems pretty cool because you have certain gadgets like cell phone grappling hook and palm pilot computer crackers, but after a while the game just gets so repetitive I lost interest. The only reason I continued playing was just so I could beat it in hope that the ending sequence was pretty cool; it wasn't. I also don't think there are enough weapons in the game. You have a handgun, sniper rifle, missile launcher, grenades, and a few other weapons, but nothing really cool. At most this was just an entertaining game but nothing epic; not that I thought it would be."
2,"bond, cool","great graphics, great sound,(...)!!!!!! i bought this because it was a bond game.they have been getting worse and worse.no replay value, incredaly easy to beat(5 hours gameplay,max)and the way people fall over is so stupid.shoot them with the most powerful gun,dont even fly.just kinda trip and die, after 1/2 second after being shotRent it, beat it, return it."
5,A bargain at $50,"As a casual gamer, it's usually pretty hard to get me to part with [my hard earned cash] for a video game. I tend to wait until games are a couple years old and then pick them up [cheap].That being said, not only did I pay [full price] for Nightfire, but I also bought the GameCube console to run it. This game is incredible. The graphics are so good in places you have to blink a couple times to be sure you aren't watching a DVD. I thought Goldeneye was a thoroughly enjoyable game, but Nightfire is a very substantial improvement in graphics, gameplay, and storyline.For the most part, Nightfire is still a first-person shooter, but with enough variety that gameplay doesn't get stale. You'll find yourself zipping across frozen lakes firing at helicopters from snowmobiles and cruising Bond's Aston Martin through the city as well.Bottom line, this is a gorgeous game that's a blast to play. You won't regret buying it."
4,Way better than Goldeneye,"Nightfire is definetely the best Bond game yet, definetely outstripping Agent Under Fire.There is a superb crew of new charachters who all have a part in the game's continuity. Unfortunately, oneof the Bond babes got blown up by a rocket launcher in Agent Under Fire.All new weapons, including a rocket launcher that you can guide yourself. But when I beat the game and got the gold PPK (Called a PP7 in the games) it put me off when I replayed the game because it's so shiny.The plot is simple, after rescuing a french intelligence agent, Bond infiltrates the villain's Austrian castle and rendezvous with the deep cover agent, the French agent Dominique. THis is when dead Agent Under Fire charachter Zoe Nightshade comes in,and you proceed through the missions, getting double-crossed, heatbroken, but that's resolved when you meet AUSSIE chick Alura McCall.A definite must for Bond fans, but if you just want a nice shoot 'em up a lot mission game, try Red Faction II."
4,Great Game,"NightFire is a great game with great graphics. The graphics are almost top of the line. There is only one thing I don't like about this game is that the story mode is too short. Twelve short levels is not enough for me. The creators should make it with at least twenty long levels so that it really keeps you occupied. Multi-Playerm,I would have to say, is excellent. All the different characters in Multi- Player is great. And that is all I have to say."
5,NightFire=NightFun,"This game starts you out slowly, and gets a little bit harder as you progress. The difficulty settings do a good job in the regard that each setting gets a little bit tougher and adds new challenges (goals) adding replay value. The more confident you become, the more difficult you can make it reaping more rewards. There is a ton of things to unlock, plus the multi-player is very good. It even lets you add computer controlled bots for you and your buddy to go against if you don't want to be on separate teams. The graphics are a little below par in my opinion, but the game keeps a very steady frame rate, which in my opinion is worth the trade out. I have two sons (9 and 11) who enjoy it also, and the violence is not graphic (IE: no blood). Highly recommended."
1,Maybe Better Than GoldenEye,"I bought this game without previously renting it, which I was a little skeptical about, but after only playing one mission, I was convinced that I had made the right decision. The play control is great, and the variety is amazing. There are three types of missions, shooting, driving, and ""rail"" missions where you move on a track. Also, the mission variety is great because each mission is long, involved, and very fun. Your gadgets always come in very handy, and the weapons are very cool, and very fun to experiment with. The multiplayer mode is amazing too. The sheer number of scenarios, including GoldenEye Strike, is mind-blowing, and you can play as characters such as Jaws, oddjob, Goldfinger, Xenia, and Wai Lin, as well as many others from almost every Bond movie. If you like First Person Shooter games, this is a must for your collection."
3,Good Game,"I liked this game, it had many improvements over its predecessor. However, the single player is not as entertaining as agent under fire, and the multiplayer can't even touch what they did with agent under fire. Do you see what I'm saying here? Agent Under Fire is your best bet, but this is still a good game."
4,"""Shaken not stirred""","Wow! I was very impressed on how good this game looks. The beginning level looks so amazing you are almost feeling like you are in the world. I was ""Shaken"" by how detailed the environment was. I was hoping every part of the game was going to be like the exact same thing. When you get inside some of the buildings, you become less interested as the detail tones down. Another down side with this game is that the A.I. is not totally perfect. For example, you have just shot an enemy in the arm, and he will just stand there. This game had me on the edge of my seat with the plot. It has an amazing plot, but it still doesn't make up for a lot of the flaws. This is the reason why I was ""Shaken not stirred"""
2,Too Easy,"I bought this game after christmas of the year 2002, and it wasn't worth it in any way. The levles were too easy, the controlles were terrible. The only good thing was the Multyplayer. If you want a good first person shooter i say go for Time Splitters 2. The graphics in James Bond were terrible compared to how they should have looked. I mean come on they have people to work with, i would rather see them as stick figures. Don't waste time or money on this. Unless u just want a multyplayer game."
2,Reworked Pagemaker,"This software is nothing more than a Pagemaker upgraded to be a copy of Quark. There is nothing in it worth making the switch from Quark. I bought a copy, but only in order to open files from the people who skimped and bought this rather than Quark. Quark 5 is still much more efficient at printing. I've noticed that files from InDesign take almost double the time to rip as the same files from Quark."
2,"Plenty of information, needs proofreading","This text contains over six hundred pages of review material, plus a full length practice test. The review material is extensive, covering all the areas of the MCAT, and is great for indentifying areas of weakness - but should not be thought of as a primary source if you're looking to learn a topic(s) for the first time, because the material is not presented in great detail or with suitable discussion. This book also suffers from an amazing lack of proofreading/editing. Typos are prevalent and can be found not only in the discussions, but also in the practice questions and answers (e.g., the final question of the practice test asks to predict the phenotypes resulting from a cross between two individuals shown on a pedigree chart but both individuals are male). Overall, this book isn't worth what I paid for it."
2,eugenepastore@yahoo.com,"I started to read this book and became extreamely discoraged. I don't know how those other individuals who reviewed this book could actually like it. First of all, I question the age of this material. According to information printed within this book, the most recent AAMC practice exam is #3, which was printed in 1995. I belive that this author has been using the same material for years, similar to Baron and Arco. Second, I found a great amount of irrelevent material that will not be tested on the MCAT. Why fill your head with information that is not on the MCAT. And third, I disagreed with the confusing way this material was presented. My testbooks do a more efficent job then this book. I recomend taking the princton review corse or buying the examkrakkers material. This book [is bad!!!]"
4,Graet for Concise Science Review,This book is great for a review of sciences. It is a bit dense but provides for a very good review with excellent practice questions. There was actually a question in the Physical Sciences section of the practice MCAT in the book that was nearly identical to a question on the MCAT I took! Very strong.

3,Helpful but . . .,"I was seeking a book on operating principles, and this book does this, in a unique, story-telling, way. I bought it without reviewing it. After reading some of it, I found myself wishing for an extensive index, more topical headings, and less story telling. But the story telling is also the books charm. Just know you are not getting an operating manual."
5,Excellent resource for parents of preemie toddlers.,This is the only resource I have found that still provides information for my eighteen month old twins that were born at 26 weeks. This book does a wonderful job of defining conditions that are a direct result of prematurity of birth. It also discusses in detail how to view your child developmentally and when you as a parent need to be concerned and enlist the aid of other healthcare professionals. I have found it extremely helpful.
5,Wow ! This book is so very helpful !,"Our twin preemies were born at the begining of December 1999, by the end of December we knew we needed HELP ! We bought this book and have used it almost everyday since. Because of this book we were able to diagnose a problem with one of our sons before the doctor even saw him. When we told him the signs and symptoms of the problem and what we thought was the cause he agreed and was amazed that we even knew about the problem. We would not have known if we did not have this book. It also makes you feel like you are not alone coping with a premature infant. We have gotten more information from this book than we got from our local hospital. My husband and I would recommend this book to anyone that has a premature infant or infants. Thank you very much for writing this book."
4,A Good Starting Point,"I got this book to understand what my foster baby was going through. While most of the information is great, the book is obviously in need of some updating. Some of the products they suggest, like Detachol, are no longer recommended. I had the hardest time finding creams or ointments without petroleum in them as the baby was still on oxygen supplementation. The general information is great. You have to do some critical thinking to assess where your child is, since every preemie is absolutely different. The growth charts are so difficult to navigate through that I don't use them. I would have preferred to see the standard chart and use the ""corrected age"" to see where the baby was. The developmental section is full of good information. We are working with Early Childhood Intervention, who helps us get to all these goals. Overall, I would suggest it as a basic informational guide. I would love to see a newer version, with updated products/charts/info."
5,Funny as hell!,"A previous reviewer didn't like this DVD, and typed out some excerpts from it to show how ""unfunny"" it was. I was laughing just reading the exchanges, and they're so much funnier to watch! Really, the mannequins are so creepy and stupid that they add to the enjoyment. Personally, I don't need the mannequins to be moving for them to be funny, and my family loves the Fuccons as much as I do.If you're silly and like stupid jokes poking fun at American sitcoms, then this is for you!"
2,Pocket size book,"I was disappointed when it came in the mail because of it's pocket size. The information is good, it's just that I was looking for a more complete book. I should have reviewed this book more before buying it."
4,Sweet little book,My husband discreetely enjoyed this book while on airplanes. It's a nice pocket size.
3,Hmmm....,"Maybe the problem is that I read Jane Yolen's Briar Rose before this one, and it spoiled me. I like the characters, at least the ones we get to know in depth. They seem real, and I care about what happens to them. The plot is definitely a little slow. One of the other reviewers said that Ms. Dean really got the feel of college life down accurately, I have to disagree. My college experience is nothing like these people's . From what I've read so far, no one really has a life, and I can't think of one person I know who talks like they do and I have very good friends who are English, Theater, and Classics majors. I guess I just expected something a little more...I don't know...""fairytale-ish"". It is a good read, but I would recommend Yolen's Briar Rose (from the Fairy Tale Series as well) before Tam Lin."
5,Amazing intertextuality lends a deeper imagery.,"""Tam Lin"" is by far one of the most complex books of this genre I have ever read. By alluding to and relying on many great works and authors of English Literature (together with the fields of drama, music and even science) it is relays a deeper meaning to the modern text. In examining each of the texts alluded to, and also the further study of the ballad itself and its various forms, new perspectives are constantly shown. Like Yolen's ""Briar Rose"", ""Tam Lin"" is an historic literary work retold to show the relevancy in our modern world. The only dissatisfaction I have is that when I went to college, the students there were more interested in getting drunk than discussing literature!"
2,Am I the only one who just didn't like it?,"I have no disagreement with this book on the grounds that it doesn't do justice to the original ballad, which, after all, I wasn't especially familiar with until after I read the Dean version. But am I the only person who finds the characters cold and difficult to really believe in? I was hoping that this book would sweep me into fantasy right away, and when it didn't, I tried to become engrossed in the lives of these college students in the seventies. But I just couldn't do it. They just aren't believable enough to be interesting and aren't fantastic enough to grab your attention until the very end."
4,"""...A Double Rose, A Rose but Only Twa""","_Tam Lin_ is the sort of book that grows on you. You can read it once, grumble that you wasted your time on a book that seems to have little to do with the actual ballad, and then find yourself sitting around on a moody evening wanting to read it again.Yes, it's mostly dorm soap opera with only hints of the supernatural, but it's fun--and funny--anyway. Laughter intersperses with a desperate hope that you, the reader, are a Molly and not a Tina. You know a novel is affecting you when you begin to wonder whether the protagonist would allow you into her circle of friends...."
1,pretentious and long-winded,"I actually have read this book 3 times: once before entering university, once during, and once after leaving. Perhaps my experience as a 1990s student at an engineering school spoiled this book, or the fact that the characters in the book reminded me of the people that most grated on me in high school: theater people. Also I happen to live in the Northfield MN area-at least she got the Carleton student ethos right. :o("
5,"Unusual, captivating","It's been said before: this is probably a book that some will love a lot, and others just won't. (Which book isn't.)I loved it and am online now seconds after finishing it to buy something else of Pamela Dean's. Tam Lin is incredibly well-controled, tantalizing, atmospheric, mysterious, etc. I think it will appeal most to those who love Shakespeare, Milton, etc and who enjoy a read with lingering and evocative moods and pace.Fabulous book. (And in my opinion, an even greater read when you don't quite know what you're getting into. Like the movie Happy Accidents.)"
5,"Intertextuality heaven: ""The star, the cup, the cross""","This book sustained me through college and continues to sustain me through life.It is a book for lovers of books and lovers of words.Classic, medieval, or Renaissance majors will be in heaven.As will anyone who enjoyed their time (or, who continues to) in the Ivory Tower.Don't let this book fade away as if it never were.It is far too beautiful not to be read, once, and then again, and then many times over."
5,One of three books that have profoundly influenced my life!,"I read this the summer before I went to college, and while my college life is incredibly different from that descirbed in the book (I attend a women's college, for one thing), I still find it remarkably relavent to my life, both in and out of the college world. Tam Lin is, in many ways, more than just a novel; I almost treat it like an English-class reading list. I made a list of all the quotations and their known refernces, and I have since been reading them. I have also been known to quote sentances of the book to others when Pamela Dean just says it better. Beyond that, it speaks to me that there is a tiny thread of magic in the most mundane of life's experiences. i'd like to end with a quote about why I love this book. ""Whatever else fairy tales might be good for, they taught you to keep your promises."" p. 437."
4,Best for its college setting,"This is one of the first real-world-setting fantasies I read. I was not familiar with the Tam Lin story at the time I read it. While I kept turning the pages, I thought it was just a tiny bit flat -- almost too pat, that is -- but what I enjoyed the most was the evocative flavor of the liberal arts college setting.Some of the drama majors/male characters seemed a bit ""over the top"", though, in my opinion. The Janet character seemed to come alive in a way the others didn't."
5,Layered and intelligent fantasy,"A friend of mine made me read this book. I loved it. Every time I read it, I caught new allusions and inside jokes. I understand that not everyone will enjoy a book about English Lit. as much as I did, so I won't recomend it to EVERYONE. Just those people who grew up quoting Shakespeare (yes, they do exeist in the real world) or who read just about everything they can get their hands on... Read this book. It's lovely, and elegantly written, and a great deal of fun besides. I also recomend Diana Wynne Jones' _Fire and Hemlock_ and Patricia McKillip's _Winter Rose_ Happy Reading!"
2,Well written but not very interesting,"Unless you are intimately familiar with Tam Lin or have a thirst to read about the lives of liberal arts students at a small Midwestern college this story will leave you saying ""So What?"" It is well written though and I may try some of Pamela's other offerings"
4,interesting,"I enjoyed this book very much, but have a few problems with it. It is definitely worth reading, but not for love of the ballad. There are a few plot inconsistancies, but those are easy to ignore, and not too bad compared to some books. In order to read it and enjoy it, you must disgregard any expectations of a wonderful retelling of the ballad, and read the book only for it's own literary value, which is great. There were things that could have been better explored, but the book on the whole rose above that. It was also inspirational to me to pursue my life-long love of English (which I just mangled horribly). Much as I love the book, I must say it was not the almost religious experience I had hoped for, and I find that Tam Lin still lacks a retelling to do it true justice."
5,A great biographical resource,"I really enjoyed this book. I have read many biographical and auto-biographical books on Crowley. Israel Regardie presents a fresh, clear picture that answered many questions I had about Crowley's meditations and spiritual exercises."
3,Worth a look,"I had to skim a lot of this book because Regardie has used it as a vehicle for his own pet psychological theories that, more often than not, have nothing to with A.C. A large amount of space is also devoted to quotes from Crowley himself; I wasn't really looking to read Crowley though.It's evident from the get-go that Regardie has a personal beef with John Symonds' ""The Great Beast."" Toward the end it becomes very tiresome.But for all of its shortcomings, there are a few nuggets scattered throughout if you're willing to wade through a lot of psychobabble. The most insightful part comes toward the very end where Regardie shares his belief that spiritual attainment in and of itself is a very ineffective weapon against neuroses. This theory makes a lot of sense to me."
3,An interesting story about an occult failure,"If you are interested in reading about Crowley's life, then this is certainly an interesting book. But to refer to Crowley as a ""great magus"" is a sadly mistaken conception. All true spiritual growth is characterised by a growing awareness of the Unity of All Life, and one's Love for that One Life. In this, Crowley was sadly lacking. Sadly, beginners on the Path of Return fail to recognize this, and think that spiritual progress consists largely of waving a ""magic wand"" around, and chanting ""barbarous names""."
5,Sturdy Shelf,"This shelf is exactly what I wanted it to be. I use it for an A/V receiver, which I wanted to have in my rackmount stand instead of hanging half way out of my tv stand due to its depth. This shelf fit the receiver about perfectly, and didn't sag at all under the weight. It's low profile enough that even the short feet on my receiver were enough to prop it up enough so that the raised edges of the shelf would not hit the body of my receiver. The sides of the shelf are less for preventing objects from sliding off than they are for supporting the weight of whatever object the shelf houses, at least for me. The shelf also takes up exactly 2U's, which is good for those who wish to buy several and stack them sequentially (no lost space). This is a great alternative to finding products with native rackmount attachments, as those can run hundreds of dollars extra. For what it does for me, this shelf was a steal price-wise."
4,If you are a Judo book collector,"I rated this book with 4 stars for two reasons:A. It is reasonably well written book, and for its quality of writing it deserves no less than 4 starsB. It does not deserve 5 stars because it does not excel at anything. It touches many subjects, but it does not give you much depth on any of these.If you already have some other Judo books such as Kodokan Judo, Best Judo, A-Z of Judo, and if you've read some sports nutrition and conditioning guides than this book will not give you much more over it.On the other hand, if you are a book collector, specially a Judo book collector you may want to have this book since it is partially written by Vladimir Putin, even though it is not clear which sections are written by Vladimir Putin.Two other ""co-authors"" are distinguished Russian Judo coaches."
3,Good book,"Although this book does not really break new ground, and in some ways it is going backwards 30 years with its line drawings rather than color photos, it is still a solid book which deserves to be a part of any comprehensive judo library. The technical material is very good, but somewhat basic."
4,The Curious Programmer,This is an excellent reference if you are trying to learn how to program using Ruby. This book is a great introduction to programming in general. The only problem was that I couldn't get the software referenced by the book to run on my computer.The book is well laid out for its intended purpose. There is a well-developed order for the presentation. I am very impressed with just how much information Chris has been able to present is such a pleasant fashion.
2,Couldn't get past the juvenile humor,"I got this book to share with my children as a possible resource for learning to program.I couldn't get past the programming examples about wetting the bed, comments about dirty notes from his girlfriend, and lots of ""dudes"". I sent it back without using it."
3,Great until chapter 8,"This book was great until Chapter 8. Now it's going way too fast without enough examples. Also there are only a few practice exercises now and they start out too advanced so that you can't do them without looking at the answers. This does not inspire confidence! There should be more practice exercises at the end of the chapter, starting with easy ones and getting harder and harder."
2,Good intentions but not very pedagogical. Too confusing for beginners.,"This claims to be aimed towards absolute beginners.While I admire the intentions of this book, it fails to deliver since it is not at all pedagogical enough to be for absolute beginners.Having programmed some Assembler and Basic back in the Amiga-days, even I was just able to follow along halfway. Then, about in the middle of the book, it turns too complex and confusing too quickly.I found 'Beginning Ruby: From Novice to Professional' to be much easier to follow than this book.But still, credits to the author for good intentions."
3,Not By Might,"I found it very hard to get into this book. The writing was a bit to ""flowery"" for my taste. I did start to get into the book and enjoy it more about half way through. There was some excitement added that drew me into the plot more. One thing that I did enjoy though is the author's use of Scripture. Al Lacy quotes many Scriptures throughout this book and the characters pray very often. I found this to be very encouraging a good reminder to pray more in my own life. I would be interested in reading other books in this series. I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
4,"Strong, faith-filled western!","My take:This was HARD to get into, but I was very satisfied about halfway through to the end. I have enjoyed the Lacy's books previously, and as I love westerns, they are good to read. If you want to read a book that discusses the Lord quite a bit, this is it. If you prefer a read that does not talk about God on every page, it is not the book for you. I admit that fact throws me a bit, but the story, the faith, the lesson, the grace behind it always makes me feel as if I spent my time RIGHT. This is WHOLESOME, and you can tell this couple is committed to their God with their heart. This is their ministry, and I so deeply respect them for that. It was an honor to review this book! Very interesting storyline- I fell in love with the characters at the end, the doctor and nurse!I was not paid for this review, and all thoughts are of my own."
2,Not what I expected,The image was much smaller on the poster than I expected and it was difficult to find a frame to fit it.
1,Laughable,"These guys stink and, guess what, they always did. I was around when they were in their 'pomp' and they were a laughing stock among most metal fans then.Anyone buying this hoping to hear proto-extreme metal will only find a group of hamfisted village idiots churning out puny, clichéd hard rock with comedy vocals, muddy production and playing that most teenagers could now better. Only their image got them any attention at the time. The music is seminal in the way dial-up is a seminal internet connection or a grain of sand is a seminal pearl.If you want seminal, stick to Celtic Frost, Bathory, Mercyful Fate, early Slayer. Don't bother with this."
1,Noise and screaming,"I feel that most people reading this review will say that they did not find it helpful... but oh well, i'm telling the truth here of what i think of this albumI won't beat around the bush... it's talentless noise. No melody, no interesting lyrics, no anything. All of the song titles are practically the same, and the lyrics to each song are just flat out horrible, they're all sending the same message over and over only each time using two or three different words (satan, hell, black, metal, etc).Anyone who considers this ""good"" or ""elite"" music cannot possibly have the slightest good taste in music whatsoever.I myself like some hard rock and even some metal, but unless you like listening to pointless lyrics assisted with blairing guitars, i wouldn't reccommend buying this Venom album or any other Venom album."
3,Noreaga and Neptunes,"This is an instant hit. The moment the song starts, it is sure to have you up jumping. Noreaga's solo effort starts off well. ""Superthug"" is also an early song produced by The Neptunes producers. So it might sound similar to other artists hits like ""I Can't Make A Mistake"" or ""Danger (Been So Long)"". This song makes every listener immediatly purchase the entire album."
3,Great - until you play NBA Live 2004,"This game was really fun when I first got it. The gameplay was great.You can use classic uniforms for every team.Players celebrate or mope around after a key shot.The franchise mode was alright.The commentary could be a lot better. They repeat themselves a lot and say things that are stupid.Fouls are called when they shouldn't be and aren't called when they should be.1 on 1 is a really fun option. You can build up your skills and can play in an urban court, beach court, or a gym.NBA LIVE 2003 IS OKAY, BUT COULD BE A LOT BETTER!The other day I played NBA Live 2004 for the first time. I could not believe the realism. Everything is extremely realistic. You feel like your actually in a basketball game. The commentary can't get any better. The gameplay is outstanding, too. The smooth graphics and player animations. You can use EVERY classic uniform from every team in a game."
4,"excelente juego, pero...","ojala alguna persona hable español para que entienda my punto de vista.Este juego es excelente de manera global, pero, no me gusta que en este juego, jugando a cualquier nivel, cualquier jugador puede tener un partido de 30 puntos. Además, detesto que en este juego no se pueda jugar a una velocidad menor (es muy rápido para mi gusto). Tuve la oportunidad de jugar la serie sega NBA 2K... y me parece mucho más real que la versión EA sports (es posible regular la velocidad de los jugadores y ningún mal jugador puede anotar más de 30 puntos).A parte de eso, el juego NBA live 2003 tiene excelentes gráficas y características."
5,This Game ROX!,I played this game on ps2 and it is the best game ever.It is so real listetyou can see the wrinlcus on kidds face its amazing. If you only get 1 game for gamecube get this one it ROX!
5,A Light in the Dark...,"Absolutely fabulous, o God - what can one say? Such a perfect combination of prog virtuosity, shamelessly romantic pop sentimentality, powerful riffing and chorus hooks to die for has not been heard since I cant't remember... Well, to be exact, the brightest moments from Spock's Beard come close, and The Beard may be the closest musical reference point here anyway. But I enjoy Kino even more: the overall feel is more down to Earth and there's an easy playfulness here that adds a specific charm to the package. I'd really like some more where this came from - a lot more, please :) Thanks, lads!"
3,Still have to find their sound,"This is a good record, of course, you can't expect anything bad coming from these 4 guys, but....I really think they have to find their own sound. You know, you can see all the influences in every song (Asia, It Bites, etc.), and I think the songs lacks from a much more progressive approach. I mean, don't expect Porcupine Tree or anything like that, just expect a pop-rock band making melodic but innofensive songs, and sometimes they fail, which means there are really bad songs in this record!The production is great. The work of the musicians is brilliant, but this is one of the cases you've got 4 genius who can't make a masterpiece. This is just the beginning, boys, get rid of your influences, and start being yourself.Oh, I want to highlight the work of John Beck, incredible keybs, as well as Chris Maitland's.All in all not a bad record, but I expected so much more"
3,A nice album,"This is a good album, but not a great album. This is a side project from guys in other bands and while it is good for what it is it isn't great. For fans of the players. This isn't another Transatlantic, which was definitely on a par with the member's regular gigs. That's not to say this album doesn't have it's moments - it does. But I don't think I'll spend a lot of time with this in the future."
2,Not as moving as the buzz,"This album starts with the terrific ""Loser's Day Parade"", but everything after is weak by comparison. Even if there is some good production, there's little quality songwriting after this first track. Tracks 2 & 3 have good moments, but each have at least one overwhelmingly cheesy part that makes you not want to play it for your friends. After track 3, I'm totally done with this.If Kino kept the quality of the first track throughout, this would no doubt be a 4 or 5 star effort."
2,Vegies boiled to death,"If I hear any more ""progressive"" references to these contemporary retro bands, I may simply have to pu.....no rather start commenting whenever I waste my money on such recordings as this. Has anyone looked up ""progressive""? I think not. Just another banal, ignorant label. Kino is a decent group and may have done fairly well in the 70's or 80's.Guess what? They are an average pop band at best. Song writing...ok...musicianship...ok.....production...ok......recording(squash,squash,DSP,DSP)....sucking the great green weenie. On every level lacking imagination, originality, and mind boggling production and adventurousness that marks the thrust of the 70's. I could go on and on. I'm starting to irritate myself though. I'll spare you all. Clearly the 5 star'ers have not listened to the masters in a while or ever."
4,"Excellent prog-pop, modern with a classic twist","Kino, a new supergroup featuring John Mitchell of Arena, John Beck of It Bites, Chris Maitland formerly of Porcupine Tree, and the untiring Pete Trewavas of Marillion and Transatlantic, has delivered some very nice modern pop tunes with a proggy twist. ""Losers' Day Parade"" is an epic of a song, but even here the emphasis is more on vocals and songcraft rather than ostentatious solos or instrumental twists. ""Leave a Light On"", in a perfect world, would be a Top 40 hit. ""Swimming in Women"" is like quirky Supertramp with an excellent guitar break. The other songs range from moody ballads to upbeat alternative pop-rock. If you want wild and wacky ten minute guitar solos in 11/8, it's not here, but there's a lot here for those who like to savor good melodies. Definitely recommended."
5,"Fresh, but Familiar","Not sure which CD this 'Robert' gentleman heard, but he's certainly entitled to his opinion. I however thoroughly enjoy this recording, and categorize it as fresh and entertaining. Second track, Letting Go, is one of those songs that is accessible almost immediately even though it is very unique, progressive, and original.Terrific musicianship, songwriting, and vocalization. These four are a great combination. I look forward to burning this one out in time for Kino to record another one."
2,Poppy Progressive ?,"Since the term ""progressive"" is getting thrown around so free and loose these days, let's invent a new category and call it ""poppy progressive"", then I'll have a label for my files and know where to put this in my cd collection."
2,Easy ambition,2 1/2Prog group of supers are neither insulting nor invigorating on this middle-road compromise yielding a lot of deadened weight and some unassuming accommodation.
5,A book good for any new-media content-creator,"This is good for everybody: editor, web designer, post-production artist, new-media creator, digital musicians, content delivery freaks etc. QuickTime is the best cross-platform creation format ever. This book explains the multitude of applications of this format into the digital domain."
1,Not worth having,"Not worth having: confused writing, poor indexing. Buy Stern and Lettieri's ""QuickTime for Macintosh and Windows"" instead."
4,japanese,"Very good experience.The book was in very good condition, and arrived in the time they said. Thank you."
3,Good enough,"This dictionary is good, but could be better: we could have the furigana above the kanji characteres. And some of the English word has no correspondent in japanese, for example when I looked for ""candle"" it gave me the answer in japanese, but when I looked for ""rousoku"" did not find it in the Japanese part of the dictionary."
2,"Great track selection, but poor mix and sound quality","I'm a Dj and own most of these tracks on vinyl, there are few CD collections of old school electro tracks available, so why Oh why do almost all of them have to be botched :( Yes the track selection has a good line up but thats where it ends. They never seem to mention in the description if these CD's are mixed, this one is. Some of the mixing is a little off beat and the songs are not leveled the same, so when one song is mixed into another and the first song is turned off the song that is now playing sound lower and feels out of place. Also the songs sound bland and are not direct master transfers. If your a dj looking to build your collections with full lenght separate tracks, skip this cd (and the 1st Vol as well). If you just want a stroll down memory lane this CD might work for you."
1,James Patterson was probably shaking his head.......,"James patterson was probably shaking his head when he saw the final cut of this film let alone the script. Due to: First of all the main highlight of the Woman's Murder Club seires is that it takes place in San Francisco and in this movie you dont even know where this takes place, Secondly the script and the movie as it goes along it goes more and more off the content and story of the fantasic book that it is (like for instance one of the characters of the Womans Murder Club in this movie was invented by the script writers, they repalced one of the characters with a fictional one and the one that is in the club ,in the book, was in the movie but as a side character). DONT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE A TRUE JAMES PATTERSON FAN. You the JP fan will probably use this DVD as an expensive coster for your drinks.Cant wait for the ABC series of The Woman's Murder Club that will premier this fall. Hopefully they will do the book series justis."
5,THRILLER,"My husband and I are fans of James Patterson and were thrilled to add this dvd to our collection. Like his books, the movie was suspenseful and exciting. The price was right and delivery was quick."
2,"Dry, very dry...","The same thing that made this movie such a great book, makes it a horrible movie. The book gets right into the story. It grabs you and holds on until the end. The movie is the same, but gives you no time to get to know the characters. If you are going to see this movie, I highly recommend reading the book instead."
2,Read the Book,"I suggest you read the book before you watch this movie. But if by some chance you happen to see this awful interpretation first,THE BOOK IS WAY BETTER! I cringe to hear that 2nd Chance will also be made into a TV movie. James Patteron is such an exceptional author and I just saw that this had so much potental as a screenplay and it failed horribly. Wait to see Roses are Red, wich will be a major theatrical release."
1,I cannot see whats inside this book to review it,How can I review this book when I cant see whats inside???Esther Hall
2,"Interesting, but not very exciting","I enjoy true crime books, and this one is fairly typical in the handling of the case: first they tell you what allegedly happened, then they tell you the story leading up to the murder, and then the trial, and finally the death sentences. Since it's a true story, there's no point in ""making you wait"" for what you know happens in the end: it says right on the cover that the woman and her accomplice were put to death for murdering the woman's husband. So, no mystery there. The only reason for reading the book is to get the full story, which is fairly interesting, but not terribly fascinating or exciting. The MOST interesting thing, ultimately, for me, is the fact that this incident was the basis for the movies Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice. So -- that's why I read it."
3,Disappointing,"While the events which prompted this book are fascinating, the author didn't seem to have the ability to maintain the reader's interest throughout. I could have quit reading after the first 50 pages, skipped the long and tedious middle, and then read the last 20 or so pages and still have gotten the salient points of the story. Instead, I kept plodding along throughout the middle, expecting to read something new to no avail. The author (mistakenly, I think) spilled the whole story at the beginning and just kept repeating the same themes over and over in the middle. In this way it was unsatisfying. However, the portrayals of the two murderers was good, plus the way she took the reader back to the '20s with references to sayings and customs of that particular period."
2,All the other reviews were old...,"Looking at the reviews I see that these are over a year old, and someone needs to note that Quark does run natively on OSX at this point, so why would you spend just about the same money on InDesign? The concept is cool, but I found it awkward to use, and certainly not something I could bump into my workflow without problems. Some of the printers we use do not accept the InDesign files for output. If you are on the other end and looking for a program to learn, to add the skill to your resume, do your self a favor, and get Quark. I've not seen any design or production positions open with InDesign as a requirement, but Quark is always a necessity."
4,Puppy pack,"I love this carrier. I am a breeder and sometimes we get puppies that need special attention. So I put them in this carrier and start my day. I also have a 3 lbs male Chihuahua that is my baby and he loves to get in this and go with me where ever I need to go. But for puppies this is the way to go. I really couldn't do without it. It does not pull or put any weight on your back. The strap that goes around the waist really help distributed the weight. I go every where with this product, retail stores, supermarkets, and no one says a thing. If you have a little guy you want to take with you and you don't want to carry or walk them this is the way to go."
1,Not for all sizes of dogs,We looked around for a carrier for our dog who is only 13 pounds and thought this would work. She hated it. Couldn't even put her in it. Too small. The carrier would be great for a newborn puppy or cat but now a dog. The size was a big misconception. We returned it.
1,Didn't like it.,I think we used this like twice. I did not like it at all. It wasn't strong. we bought it as a replacement for the cheap one that broke and this was just as bad.
3,Okay...,"We shared these tiles between two classrooms and let the students work in pairs. Some of them began breaking apart, but they were still useful in the classroom."
1,Not recommended!!,"I cannot find the proper words to describe this item. Bad, really bad. It does not work good. Even though I had to connect a noise suppressor I could hear many noises thru the stereo."
1,Run away from this amp,"This is a piece of SSHH**TT amp that I was fooled into buying for the cheap price and you get what you pay for.It had a whine that is because of the design leaking engine whine thru the line level connectors into your system, EVEN IF UNIT IS NOT POWERED. I diconnected power and rewired my system to rid of this whine and found out all I had to do was disconnect the line level which was still connected to my sytem.It is barely stronger than the radio itself and is truly worthless, even thou it did have decent clarity when car was not running, so whine would not be present.So run away from this amp!"
4,Excellent Value,"These are excellent speakers for the price. Compared to the Bose 101's, these are 2-way, with a larger driver, heavier, and 1/2 the price. They have a better high-frequency response, and the bass is impressive for this price range. The mid-range is a tad bit ""muddy"". However, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the sound and the solid construction."
2,An Engineer Plants Onions,"This is neither a book for beginners nor a book for experienced gardeners. There are some valuable concepts, quickly presented, but the book fails to connect with real life.A four sentence quotation will speak for itself. These are ""growing instructions"" for green onions on page 62: ""Use .39 ounce (1 tablespoon + 1 1/4 teaspoon)of seed per 100 square feet (col. BB) or .0078 ounce (1/8 teaspoon)for 2 square feet (.39 ounce x 2 sq ft [divided by] 100=.0078 ounce. On 3 inch centers (col. CC), a 100-square-foot area will hold a maximum of 50 plants (2,507 plants x 2 sq ft [divided by] 100 sq ft=50.14 plants). To ensure 50 green onion seedlings to transplant, you will need to sow 72 green onion seeds (50 [divided by] .70 germination rate [col.AA]=71.43). The 72 seeds broadcast (col. FF) in a flat will take up approximately 1/10 of a flat 6 to 8 weeks (col. HH) before the scheduled planting date.""The same sort of homey advice is offered for corn, beans, etc."
1,Beginners Beware,"At best, this is a book an experienced gardener might pick up at the library to glean a few useful ideas about biointensive gardening (I found nothing that isn't presented better elsewhere). At worst, unsuspecting beginners will think this book is the authoritative source it claims to be, try to implement it's convoluted techniques, and fail miserably.All gardening books convey a certain sensibility about gardening that sets the perspective for the endeavor. Sustainable Vegetable is weird mix of new age idealism and rocket science. Trust me, gardening is not as complicated as this book makes it sound!The Vegetable Gardener's Bible by Ed Smith is THE definitive title on the subject.Square Foot Gardening by Mel Bartholomew is good for small gardens. Four Season Harvest by Elliott Coleman is excellent for winter gardening. Tanya Denckla's Gardener's A-Z Guides are excellent."
3,A Little Too Technical For Me,"It is interesting reading if you want to know EVERYTHING about intensive gardening. I view gardening as stress relief, not to eat to live, so I don't like to use my brain this much when working in the garden. I give it 3 stars because I do feel if one really needs this information, it could be useful. An engineer minded person would probably love this book and get a lot of useful info out the main book, How to Grow More Vegetables. I am technical minded, but after working 60 hours a week, I don't want to strain my brain over a garden."
2,at best an introduction,"I was very dissapointed in the length of this book. Compared to other organic gardening books, this should be listed as a brochure, or maybe as a synopsis of ""How to Grow More Vegetables..."" A buyer's money could be better spent. Personally, I would not buy it again. Figuring that it would cost me half of the cost of the book to return it to Amazon, I'll probably just give it away as a gift to a new gardener. This is not to say that there is no useful information in the book, but more information can be found in other, -longer- books"
2,"Over-Simplified Version of ""How to Grow More Vegetables""","I was hoping for a companion book to the incredible ""How to Grow More Vegetables Thank You Ever Thought Possible,"" but it is just an overly simplified, watered-down version of the book. There is still some great information in it, but disappointing from the standpoint of an experienced gardener or one who has already been using the biointensive method to begin with."
3,"""Cliff Notes"" for their other book","This book is the quick and dirty run down of Jeavons' How to Grow More Vegetables. It is written in a very approachable way as compared to the other book; however, I think that if the reader is serious about attempting a biointensive approach, they are better served to hit Grow more Vegetables with a highlighter and a notebook.If you are looking for an overview of the biointensive method, this is a nice quick read."
5,Bill Murray's Best,"Deserves to be on your shelf with Caddyshack, Vacation, Animal House, and Fletch. It's that good, and probably the most underrated movie of the 1990s. Randy Quaid's funniest role since Cousin Eddie from Vacation. Tony Shalhoub's non-English speaking cabbie will have you on the floor. And Jason Robards' cynical police chief plays the perfect foil to Bill Murray's cynical, tired-of-the-grind bank robber. Do yourself a favor. Buy it -- because you'll watch it until you've memorized the lines like you did with Fletch, Vacation and Animal House."
2,I can't take Randy Quaid any more,"Clever story and I like Bill Murray and Geena Davis, but Randy Quaid's character was so obnoxious I had to fast-forward through every scene with him in it. It must be possible for someone to play a dim-witted by likable character, no?"
2,Weak Stuff.,"Viewed: 8/12Rate: 38/12: Quick Change is another hopeless comedy with an all-star cast. The only surprise I have is that it wasn't made in the 80's. I only laughed twice: the bus scene and the dark alley scene. The latter is a lot funny if you think back to A Streetcar Named Desire. I am sure there are plenty of more of references including Dog Day Afternoon for other certain moments. Otherwise, there isn't much happening. The plot doesn't make any sense. After planning the bank robbery, they have had the escape route thought out as well. All in all, Quick Change is a big miss for Bill Murray fans; the always reliable Randy Quaid is awful in this."
4,Good,"Not Bill Murray's best, but still a collectible! It's got some very funny parts. I'm glad I own it."
1,A comedy that forgot to include anything funny,"Here we go again: a comedy with no actual laughs. Bill Murray plays his usual wry self in a bank heist plot that goes awry after the getaway. I kept waiting for it to get at least a little funny, but no cigar. Not even mildly amusing, yet I got through it anyway."
5,"Laugh out loud, bend over funny","No doubt this is one of my top 5 favorite comedies. Not just amusing, but laugh out loud, bend over funny. You have to see this movie. I'm not sure why its not considered a classic. I'm waiting until it's released on DVD to add it to my collection."
5,Great movie!,"What can I say when you have Bill Murray, Geena Davis, Jason Robards and Randy Quaid your gonna get a great funny movie! This one was hard for me to find to but not for Amazon! Awesome service!"
3,Hold Up,"Although I liked Quick Change (1990), the film that it was based on is the French film ""Hold-Up (1985) with with Jean Paul Belmondo"" which is much funnier."
1,Sorry to disagree - but I thought it was awful,"Maltin's film book says this is very funny, and Bill Murraycan be very good, but I thought this was a waste of talentedpeople, with weak jokes and situations. I thought the actors were trying not to look embarrasedwhile dealing with weak material.Other reviewers praise it highly -- I wish I could agree with them, but I can't. (I'm glad I taped it from TV -- now I can erase it.)"
2,What is this?,Are we to believe millionare actor Bill Murray would rob a bank dressed as a clown? This film is completely implausible. A terrible farce of a movie.
4,Bill Murray's humor is top notch!,"The movie's beginning is absolutely the best part of the film, although it maintains a great level of humor throughout the film. My only knock on the movie is that it tends to slow down towards the end when the gang gets very close to the airport. The twist at the end in the airplane could have been done a bit better. Overall a good movie."
3,What Kind of a Clown are you anyway?,"The Bank security guard asks Grimm after he blocks thedoor open with his size 20 Clown Shoe.Grimm's response:""The crying-on-the-inside kind I guess!""is a classic! It's been an inside family jokesince my wife and I saw it long ago. Thisfilm is a good mix of humor and crime caperand has strong supporting performances by Randy Quaidand Geena Davis and by Jason Robards as the determineddetective hot on their trail. But I won't ruin itby saying any more. Worth adding to your collection,especially if you are a fan of Bill Murray's.P.S. I meant to give it Four Stars!"
5,2010 date explanation,"Hopefully, this'll clear up some confusion about the 2010 release date: When studios announce a new DVD title with a street date (which can be months and months before it's released) Amazon will make that title available for pre-order; this helps generate dedicated sales. However, between the announcement and the actual release date - many things can happen: Legal issues and production issues to name a few. Should any of the above occur, the studio may give a TBD (To Be Determined) or dummy street date (also known as a parking lot date) while they iron out the details. This does not mean that the project is cancelled; just put on hold indefinitely.While Amazon is still taking pre-orders, no one knows when it will be released; but, rest assured, when it is - Amazon will get it in your hands.(btw, I have no affiliation with Amazon.com or it's affiliates. I just want to spread the knowledge)"
4,Above average movie,"This stars Bill Murray, Geena Davis and Randy Quaid as bank robbers. They have to get out of NYC before the cops get them.This is a short, fast-paced and fairly entertaining romp with great co-stars in it. I enjoyed seeing Kurtwood Smith (Red Foreman of That '70s Show) as a mobster. This is a fun movie to watch when you want to relax and not think about your problems."
1,Right-wing garbage,"This is yet another example of right wing trash for cash. Timperlake is a former staffer for Rep. Dan Burton, the crazy man who doctored the Web Hubbell tapes, re-enacted the Vince Foster suicide, and fathered an illegitimate child. Read this book if you want to read a right-wing hit piece. But don't expect to learn any facts."
1,Total Right-Wing Hogwash,"Man. It just goes to show how some people believe that the truth is anything boldly asserted and vigorously maintained. This book is nothing but right-wing propoganda in the shroud of a ""shocking expose.""If you like fiction, feel free to read it. If you want the facts, don't bother."
1,Homeless Dude,"As a kid, I often took bikerides that took me past the Watergate Hotel. Every day, outside the hotel, there was this homeless-looking dude who distributed pamphlets with the same name as this book."
1,a rat book,"lots of sensationalism, unfunded accusations, paranoid and bias. no wonder it's only worth a few cents."
1,So was all the panic justified?,"Just look at those other reviews - the horror! The pathos!! The threat to life as we know it!!!! But here we are, more than a decade later. Life goes on. And yet another neocon smear job attempt falls flat. President Clinton was one of this nations top 5 Presidents - and for good reason. Time to put away your xenophobia, racism, and pointing fingers, people. The problem isn't the Chinese. It's the right-wing Republicans."
3,"Important but out dated, thus 3 stars not 5","This book was published before the theft of Nuclear secrets to China but it shows how Bill Clinton and Al Gore bent over backwards to the Chinese who were funding their campaign. However it gives insight to the connection before Wen Ho Lee and the Los Alamos scandal.companion books to buy would be Absolute Power or any book by Ann Coulter and Barbara Olson.The book is a very dry read and full of information about players like the Riady's, John Huang,Yah Lin Trie, Marisa Hsia and Master Hsing Yun who the press mentions at passing but never got in depth with their history and dealings"
5,"Clinton and Gore have sacraficed country , ehtics and morali","This book will certainly clairify that the emperor has no clothes. Even yellow dog democrats(a democratic member that would vote for a yellow dog before voting for someone outside the democratic party) will find the documentation in The Year of The Rat hard to refute. The evidence documented in this book is grounds for an impeachment trial and a conviction of Treason for Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore. Clinton and Gore have put themselves before God,Country, and Family. Mrs. Clinton says it takes a village to raise a child. I believe she left out the words socialist and communist to make the statement believable.After reading this book you will walk away with a sense of of betrayal from the highest level in our goverment."
4,A stunning political thriller drawn from today's headlines.,"This book is difficult to put down, a real thriller that grips you with a damning portrayal of an ineffectual democratic government in a new cold way with Chinese communists. Set in the present day, this political fiction seems like it's drawn from today's headlines. It's not perfect, and many of the characters seem a little hackneyed. ""President Clinton"" is too obviously based on the current President of the same name. Then again, the narrators' voice does a terrific job of satiring the hyperbolic, bombastic tone of Clinton's strident critics who find a way to transform the most mundane facts into evidence of conspiracy or moral failing. In this regard, the writing succeeds wonderfully. Along the lines of Orson Welles' War of the Worlds, the authors have created a fictional masterpiece that many will mistake for tomorrow's headlines. I would recommend this to older teenagers looking for new challenges."
5,"Must be read in conjunction with the new book, BETRAYAL.","I admit that I am slow to have gotten around to reading this excellent book, but I have witnessed the cover-up of insidious behavior with an illegal war in Kosovo, and the nearly neglected espionage by a Chinese scientist at Los Alamos. These events have given more flavor to the excellent documentation of the authors. Now that the new book, Betrayal, is out, even the die-hard Cllinton lovers have to sit up and take note."
5,Quality component,I bought this for a 2006 Hyundai Elantra. It fits perfectly and works perfectly. This is a lot easier and more reliable then trying to splice together a generic sensor. Get this one. It fits and it works great!
5,Our 2 1/2 yr. old LOVES this video AND Dad & Mom too!,"My brother loaned us his copy of this video. He had to twist my arm to get me to take it as it didn't seem like our boy would like it, or was old enough, or...whatever. I wasn't expecting much. Well, after about 30 watchings, I must say that it is still enjoyable! And our 2 1/2 year old son hasn't stopped requesting to see it again. There are 3 animated stories on the video. The first is the longest and the best, ""Rupert and the Frog Song."" There are 2 more ""stories"" (the last 2 are closer to animated music videos), and they're enjoyable, but not in the same league as Rupert. The music on the first is a tribute to the Hollywood swim-ballet movies of the 30's & Grand Opera--composed by Paul McCartney. The second is a sort of Reggae song done by Paul & Linda McCartney & Wings. The third is a classic rock song with a wonderful guitar solo by Paul. The animation is imaginative and detailed. This video is well worth the investment!"
4,"Good, but not great","Tiger Woods golf is a descent golf sim. Like other reviews say, its way too easy. The game does have a lot of depth though. In the ten + hours I played it, I was only 37% done. The competition gets progressivly harder when you start taking on the CPU oppents. The game does start off with a nice tuitorial. Pebble Beach and St. Andrews are remarkably real, but the fantasy courses may irk the average golf fan. So all and all its definitely worth the rent, but unless you're a golf fan, like myself, or get completely raptured its probably not worth the 50 bucks."
1,No Good..Weak effort,"Too easy and too hard all at once. You swing by using control stick...it just isn't a good system for your swing. Rent it first and you will see what I'm saying. Wish it could be a good review because this game is the reason I bought the system(I love golf games) but it falls short. Little childish as well with the corny cut scenes. Thank goodness for ""agent under fire"". Now thats a good game! Not great but good."
3,"Not the original episodes... so I can not go above 3 stars, even though I love this documentary series.","The original episodes of Battlefield: Vietnam were about 2 hours or so. This, and the other Battlefield: Vietnam DVD cut them into a little less than 1 hour. I saw the original series on PBS in 1999, and clearly recall many details that are not in these episodes (the tunnels of Cu Chi, for example had tunnel design, layout, fortifications, traps etc. that is missing from the episode on this DVD).This is still a fantastic documentary and I'm very pleased to have them in my library as they are so very well researched and presented. I just wish the original episodes could be purchased. These edit out a great amount of detail that made viewing so immersive. I recommend getting both DVD's and the original episode order can be found in the wiki article for this series. That's the best way to watch them, I think.Enjoy. If I ever do find the original episodes, I will update.my review."
2,Just not the same,My first ever downer review for a product. Buck knives are known to be rugged reliable and last generations! The buck 112 I carry has been passed down to me and been worn longer than i have been alive. That being said the belt loop finally wore out. The replacement i just ordered cracked and almost broke just putting the knife in the sheath. I am surprised that quality on such a basic item has declined so much. i know i won't have it long. That being said it does operate as described it holds a buck 112.
2,Flawed,"There is a felt sticker behind the brass button closure to protect your knife from scratches, but the sticker leaves a sticky residue on the knife upon insertion and withdrawal."
1,Where is the Old Martin Marquis???,"I have played a Martin D-35 for the past forty years and have had Marquis stings on her for most of these years. I don't change my strings often and actually enjoy the full, bass rich response of an older string. Anyway I decided to restring my guitar with these strings and what a disappointment. The tone was fuzzy and tinney, none of the rich bass sound I was used to (nothing like the older Martin Marquis sound). I waited a bit as stings do ""mellow out""; the strings continued to be fuzzy in sound, they are now in the trash. I tried the Martin SP 7100/ Cleartone in the same gauge and the sound is much, much better; more percise and full. I hope they will mellow into the tone I love."
3,Vintage 80's high-jinks,"Movie not to be taken seriously, but if you watched movies from the 80's such as Porky's, Last American Virgin, Hardbodies, give this one a try."
5,Great Old School Soul CD,"This is a great compilation. The sound quality and volume consistency is very good. I bought this for If You Let me Make Love to You and Right on the Tip of My Tounge, two songs I've loved since I was a little boy, but the whole CD is fabulous."
3,Review,"This turned out to be not one of my favorite songs, however there are a few of the songs that make extreme points. For this I would recommend it to someone who enjoys right in your face gospel talking lyrics."
2,Plantin' a Seed. Not Lyrical Strength...,"Danny Rodriguez a.k.a. D-Boy put out two albums as far as I remember. I had them both. ""Plantin' a Seed"" and ""The Lyrical Strength of One Street Poet""Plantin' a Seed includes Church Hoppers, Doggin' the Devil, King David, It's a Disease and a few more. I enjoyed this album at the time and I would like to hear it again as it has been a long time. The album ""The Lyrical Strength..."" includes a song that lists most or all of the songs from ""Plantin'"" and that's where the other reviewer is getting that information. If you can find either of these albums, congratulations. They are a hard find and now out of print."
1,almost 15 years ago...,"We thought this was cool! LOL! It is funny listening to this again. My older brother listened to this and other old rap tapes all the time and I with him. It was so cool then but now it is just bleh.I have the tape in front of my right now and the title is ""The Lyrical Strength of One Street Poet""On the Audio Cassette, the tracks are as follows:Side A:That Ub UrselfUb Urself (Reprise)Drop The MicThe Boy Don'tPlaySlacknessCease for PeaceSide B:Flow TimeShoutGod's HouseLast DaysHip-HopcracyCome Back HomeI don't know if the CD is titled differently or something but Plantin' A Seed is said in one of the songs"
3,Bit Slow getting started,"This is a pretty solid follow up to Dawnthief. It's a bit slow getting started, and doesn't feel as polished as the previous book. Once the Raven charactors take center stage the book does become more satisfying."
2,"Step away from the vehicle, and this game","You may remember the original Smuggler's Run as one of the PS2's early launch titles that was by no means excellent, but was a lot of fun nonetheless. Since it had a loyal following, and with the recent wave of GBA ports, a GBA conversion was inevitable. This GBA version of Smuggler's Run does not invoke the same type of fun the PS2 version did which was expected, but the overall game feels unpolished due to the tedious missions, poor collision detection, and pop up galore. The graphics are pretty good for the most part, but the pop up trees, rocks, and hills nearly ruin the experience. The lack of options in the game (there's not even a multiplayer mode) really hurts the game as well. All in all, Smuggler's Run pales in every aspect to any other port of the game, but it is a less than half decent game that you might get a bit (and a small one at that) of fun out of."
2,Don't expect too much,"If you are a big fan of Smugglers Run for the PS2 and I am, don't expect the GBA version to be even close. The idea of the game is the same, but the graphics are choppy and weak. Colliding with other cars and items such as trees and rocks ruin the experience by making you lose total control or making you come to a complete stop. I was especially disappointed with how easy this game was to complete, there really was no challenge at all. There is no option to complete against other drivers, and the whole Smugglers Run feel is just not there. I would suggest somehow renting or borrowing this game before you buy to make sure it is what you want."
1,poor track record,"Judging from Destination's port of ""Midnight Club Street Racing,"" this will probably be another bad game. In fact Midnight Club for the GBA is one of the worst games I've ever played, while the PS2 version was fine. I can only imagine Destination is going to insult another fine PS2 title and rob us of precious dough."
3,Native American - Apache Voices,Not terribly interesting. Unless one is interested in the Apache Nation specifically - probably will want to by-pass this one.
4,Interesting Answers to Rarely Asked Questions,"Vince Staten is a long time fan who has has written a baseball book almost entirely devoid of the common and usual ingredients found in most baseball books, such as statistics or rehashed history. Staten uses a baseball game attended by himself and his son to provide the reader with interesting information and anecdotes about non-playing aspects of the game and the sport. This book is not for fans into sabermetrics or player bios. This book is for fans who want to know more about topics peripheral to the actual game, such as how: stadiums are architected; playing fields are maintained; balls and bats are designed; ballpark food and souvenirs are selected and sold. We never really learn why foul poles and foul lines are fair in baseball, while their equivalents in other sports are not, but the the reader does enjoy learning more about the trivial details and background of baseball's infrastructure and history."
1,slow machine,"I purchased this as a gift for my parents for Christmas. I am returning it tomorrow and hoping I can grab something else for them.First: I am shocked that the only way I can upload photos is either BlueTooth or via a memory card. I can't hook it up to my computer and just upload pictures with a USB cord.Second: It keeps freezing on me. I have 61 pages of photos to scroll through on my memory card. But I can't seem to go more than 8 - 10 pages without it freezing.Third: I finally did get a few photos uploaded, and went to view the slide show, and it corrupted one of them.I would not recommend this."
1,Did not work,"I bought this as a gift for my dad, and unfortunately waited until 2 days before Christmas to turn it on to pre-load some pictures. I was very disappointed when all I could see was a bright white screen, and no home menu to start the ""easy"" setup. After turning it off/on, adjusting the brightness, and a slight shake the best I could make out of the home screen was a very faint image if you looked at the screen from an angle. I will be frantically trying to purchase another frame now.. And will not be choosing the Pandigital. A beautiful looking frame, with great options... but Very disappointed."
3,A little game that could have been,"I picked up this game because I liked the PS2 version of Midnight Club Street Racing, which resembled the popular Midtown Madness series. (No wonder, because they were developed by the same company.) This GBA port utilizes an overhead view like that in Grand Theft Auto and GTA 2. You start as a taxi driver in New York and must race your way up the Midnight Club ladder. When you win the New York races, you unlock the city of London.Contrary to what the box claims, the street models of New York are not accurate at all. After playing for almost a week I still can't figure out what the streets are. The controls are very straightforward, making the game easy to play, but sometimes you head down (toward the bottom) and that makes turning a bit confusing. The races are generally easy to beat.This game makes a good flight companion. Otherwise it lacks depth and killer graphics. Get it if you find a used one or at a discount."
3,"OK, but not that good.","I bought this game in hopes that it would be more like GT Advance, but it's not. In fact, you race in an above view. I don't really care for those types of games, but I'm not trying to say this is a really bad game. It's ok I guess, but no where near as good as the PS2 version. The whole idea of the game is a little screwy, and the graphics aren't super great either. But all in all it's not that bad a game for GB Advance."
3,Czechoslovakia history,"This book did not give the details of this time period that I was hoping it would. Intereesting, but not too informative."
1,Wrong address,"Because it was sent to the in correct address, it was returned and credit was given to my credit card, try again some day."
5,Deep Soul - Volume 2,The compilators truly hit the mark on this one. I enjoyed every track. I'm still looking for Volume 1 - It must really be outstanding.
5,really unique,"this is a really cool collection of victorian era songs ""inspired by"" the book tipping the velvet about lesbians in victorian times. the songs don't really have much to do with the book, other then that they're also cool. it's just a neat collection of old songs, some of which are pretty scandalous, actually. It's always good to remind yourself we aren't the first generation to discover sex. definately give it a listen, if only because it's a kind of music you'll probably never hear anywhere else."
1,WHEN DO I GET THIS SHIPMENT !!!!!!!!!!,"Ordered on 2/02/06...this ""REVIEW"" came to my mailbox on 3/22/06 HOW CAN I REVIEW SOMETHING YOU DON'T BOTHER TO MAIL"
4,Dorn and Soffas have done it again,"Dorn and Soffas continue to amaze me. They have created for teachers the ""I get it"" of teaching for comprehension. With a mix of theory and practical information for use in classrooms they have given teachers a toolbox with which to guide students into lifelong learning."
3,"Works, but..",The item I received does not match the illustration. So did I get what I wanted ? Who knows ?
3,Unsure,Not exactly sure how to rate the sharpener. Purchased it specifically for my new Mac Knife but tried it on 2 of my older chef knives first. Not the sharp edge I was looking for after use. Kind of afraid to use on the Mac although the sharpener is recommended.I'm not sold yet but will report back later.
1,Dullinator consumers beware,"What a disappointment compared to its cousin the Ax sharpener that took a chip out of my fiskars ax this device dulled and damaged every edge I tried. Not even worth returning or reselling, cause I would only be ripping off someone else."
4,"This works really well, but....","This product really did help with pregnancy nausea. I don't think I took it off once during the first three months-- I even wore the bracelet(s) when sleeping. The only trouble was the size: I ordered the children's size (the suggestion if you have smaller wrists) and received the adult. I emailed customer service multiple times but never heard back from the company. This product does stretch a bit after much use. I eventually replaced the bracelet with a similar brand that uses a stretch fabric and which was sold at the local drugstore for less money. I did, however, prefer this brand because the strap is adjustable, allowing for more pressure."
4,Works as expected,"I like this better than the Seaband, because you can control the tightness and pressure and it is smaller and less bulky. It looks exactly like the picture and could easily be mistaken for a watch or a runner's fuel band. I really feel like it helped me during the early part of my pregnancy to avoid nausea. I ordered the children's size after reading other reviews because I have small wrists and this was a good call, because it fit perfectly. It was definitely good for me."
1,Disappointing on comfort and the monaural switch,"I purchased two of these about 1 week apart. Due to a hearing loss in the right ear, I wanted a monaural earphones to be able to hear all of my mp3 music. The first one worked (monaural) for a few seconds then cut out. The replacement pair failed to function in monaural at all. Although I only had either pair on for less than a minute, I found them uncomfortable, and for me, an uncomfortable fit. I might have been willing to settle for the discomfort, but not without being able to receive a monaural signal."
5,An excellent history of Egypt,"Watterson's book provides a fascinating, and very readable, introduction to the ancient land of Egypt. I couldn't put it down! And, our local library can't keep it on the shelves.Watterson combines the best of the classical authors (Herodotus, Strabo, etc) with the best of current scholarship. She has a unique ability to focus on what is most important and interesting in the long span (5000 years!) of Egyptian history.This book is very well written, very rich in information, and truly a pleasure to read. It is one of the very best histories that I have ever read. I believe that it will soon become a classic textbook, reference, and popular work. I recommend it without reservation to anyone - high school or college student, scholar, or general reader - who wants an excellent history of Egypt from ancient to modern times."
5,Great book for the Scientists of the Group,"The Ordo Dracul book was a great read all around. Gave you a look into those that search for the ""Great Works"" and life beyond vampirism.With the new Coils and secretive subsect ""Sworns"" and new bloodlines, it is a great book. Definately a good read for those just interested in the covenent or wanting to play a Dragon character."
1,Ok at first...,"I bought a pair of these speakers for my Jeep. I was excited about them because they seemed great - big magnets, high power, and so on. However, I put them in and they ended up sounding really tinny and unclear. I had 50 watts rms running to each speaker, and they handled that power well at first. They didn't distort (although they didn't sound clear and crisp at all), but very quickly the power blew the woofers. Now the tweeters make a little bit of tinny sound, but the woofers do nothing at all. I am very disappointed with these speakers. They do not sound like quality speakers in the least, although they do look pretty cool. Their power ratings are completely unrealistic, as they couldn't even begin to handle a quarter of the power that they are advertised. The company also has not responded to my emails to see if they will fix the speakers."
4,Excellent Book,"While this book follows the same basic theme as the one before it, it's still a interesting book. St. Helens is an fascinating world which reflects our own in many ways. A good read."
5,Great series but is that it?,Does it end with Orchid? I think it is great but I want more of it. Make the series longer.
4,Great place to visit!,"Ms Krentz has created a fascinating world with some complex, interesting and just plain fun characters. Her stories make me wish I could go for a nice, long visit and maybe have an adventure of my own.Her main characters are the kind of people you'd like to have as friends, and she knows how to make them ""real"" to her readers.This story is the second in a trilogy. Do yourself a favor and read all three of them. I didn't want to leave that world when I finished the last story; bet you'll feel the same way.Who knows? Maybe Ms Krentz has a few more stories to tell about the people on the other side of the curtain.I give this story a 4 & 1/2!"
4,Greatist?,"The new songs rock. Give me love is an awesome song, with a catchy loose riff and is a spectacular come back single. Talk to me is brilliant straightforward rock and is very similar to the ac/dc song live wire, since ac/dc was Gary Stringers main influence (lead singer). Lucky number is classic reef similar to the glow era. And just dropped in is a treat. They are all good. BUT where are all the singles they released, some of the best too, Getaway, new bird, superhero, all i want etc. Ok they didn't go top 30, but they are still awesome songs. Also it would have been nice to have a b-sides disc, like on the ash greatist hits. Its a brilliant intro to reef, but not the definitive greatist hits. I hate to say this too because i adore reef, they are the best band in the world, but isn't just quite what I was looking for."
1,Whats This,"Pieace of junk,not recomended.Dont Know what this item is made for,but it does not work with the PSP"
4,Good value,"I needed a case I could carry out to the field with two guns. This was half as much as others, but it does the job. Not a whole lot of options in camo or length, but again for the price, I'm not complaining."
5,Includes all the new features of Photoshop 7,"Adobe Photoshop is simply the best image-editing software currently available and is the choice of preference for millions of graphic artists worldwide. Its breadth of features and raw power to manipulate any type of image has made it the recognized standard. New graphic artists need to learn Photoshop, while established professionals need to keep their skill sets current with every new revision. Collaboratively written by Adopbe Photoshop experts Peter Bauer and Jeff Foster, Special Edition Using Adobe Photoshop 7 includes all the new features of Photoshop 7 including: Macintosh OS X compliances (native mode and carbonized); an integrated image management system; an improved painting engine for both PC and Mac versions; a more advanced web workflow capability; and added editing features. User Level: Intermediate-to-Advanced, 1008 pages."
2,I could take it or leave it...,"...so I'm returning it. I certainly didn't expect a bag of the same quality as the one in the film, but the one I received is pretty cheesy. As noted by earlier reviewers, the material used is rather unattractive- not even a pleather, more of a fabric printed to look like pleather that didn't really resemble leather. Its also smaller than I thought, though the dimensions were listed for all to see, so its my own fault. It's not the worst bag I've ever seen, and a younger girl could pull it off, but I know that I'll never actually use it, so back it goes."
2,Trashy NOT Flashy La Rue Handbag,This bag doesn't look like the one in the movie. I was expecting it to be much darker in color and the fringe tassel looks as though it was dipped in gold paint. Thank you Amazon for making returns so easy! :o)
5,Love love this bag!,"This bag is the coolest and I get compliments about it all the time. I love that I am like the only one I've seen wearing it around town. The thing that was a bit off was the material, it did seem a little bit ""cheap"", but I took care of that and gave it the distressed look I was looking for and made it way more soft. I just got a pumice stone and rubbed it all over the bag, it worked! It looks way better and I carry it with me all the time. It's a great size for me and has the assymetry that sets it apart from the rest! Recommend completely :)"
4,Give it a chance,"I was pretty worried about buying this purse after reading the reviews on it. Although I can honestly say I'm very pleased with my purse. It is not real leather and yes the color is slightly off but it is still very cute and its the bag from The Devil Wears Prada. I can fit alot of stuff in mine( sunglasses in case, Full wallet, Checkbook, Compact, Gum, Cell phone and Keys) you just have to put it in the purse a certain way. I'm also constatly getting compliments on it when I carry it. The arm hole is perfect and fits snuggly over a jacket. I really like mine and I'm glad I gave it a chance."
2,Greatly Disappointed!!,I was so excited to own a souvenir from one of my favorite movies especially when I saw the box at my doorstep. but that is where the excitement ends.I was disappointed to find out the bag is faux leather and not as roomy or luxurious as I was expecting. I paid the sale price of $49.99 and it is still not worth that price.
2,It's not the worst bag I've ordered but it rank's up there,"1) I thought the bag was going to be leather, but it feels and looks like ""pleather""2) you really can't use it to really carry anything in it, the way the inside opens you can't even fit your wallet in it.3) I can handle new fashion trends but this one I could never figure out how to wear it.4) I have sent it back, so good luck to all of you, who think its great!"
2,Not what I expected.,"I like this bag, but don't totally LOVE this it. It doesn't live up to what I expected it to be from the picture. It looks very cheap...not distressed. Although I do like the design and the color. I am waiting to use it during the Fall/Winter...definately nothing that can be used in the summer. I hate that I paid more than $25 for this."
4,THE BAG THAT'S OUT OF THE BOX,"I was looking for a cool new bag that would carry me pretty much though the year. Read about it in People magazine and had to give it a try. Distressed it is but you'll never have to worry about it getting beat up because it already is!! Everyone has asked me about it, as it really looks like nothing else out there. My only problem is that I expected it to be roomier inside. It truly is a medium sized bag even though photos make it look very large. I love its versatility and all the ways I can wear it."
3,Unique bag that's beyond expectations,"My bag has finally arrived today. It's modern, sassy and very New York -- exactly what Sex in the City Fashion guru Patricia Field would've done. It does seem more ""distressed"" looking than I would like, and I'm not a big fan of faux leather either. Despite of these things, the design is quite ingenious. This bag pairs better with Fall/Winter clothing in my opinion, although it does tote well with some of my colorful summer dresses. All in all, if you want a bag that's truly unique, this is the bag for you."
2,not as cool as i had hoped,"poor quality....much lighter than the photo showed.not impressed, definitely online buyer's remorse."
3,I don't think it deserves that bad of a review,"The first day I brought my bag into work, I got compliments from everyone I work with (including the straight men) and I work at a pretty stylish place in LA.It's a great bag for me to take to work and then fold over as a clutchto go out at night with. My one complaint is that the strap is a little awkward.Yes, the bag isn't real leather and yes, it isn't huge but what did you expect for $79? In the garment district, you can get a fake Chloe Paddington for $80 (made out of fake leather that isn't much bigger) - at least you're not paying for a knock off."
3,Not all that great,"I got this bag because I fell in love with it from the movie. First it's color is alot lighter than what it shows online. It is almost tan, not brown. I do like the design concept, however, with all that material, it is a ver small bag. Medium sized is giving it a generous name. it is between a small to medium size bag to me, at least with the ""storage"" part or it. If you are looking at it's total size, it is definatly a large/xlarge bag.Being able to wear it different ways is excellent. I don't think the quality was worth $80, but you are paying for the design and the hype. I have gotten many compliments on the bag however, and my sister wants one as well. All in all, it is an ok bag."
2,la rue bag,"most of the reviewers hit the nail on the head when descrbing the quality of the bag (i.e. poor quality) in terms of color, the studds and the material of the bag. I would not recommend paying more than $30 for this bag. it is however spacious enough for wallet, cell phone and a pair of glasses. the design is defnitely ingenious and novel --its a decent bag to have in your collection of bags --dont expect a high quality bag and you wont be disapointed"
3,"Nauseatingly Cute, but relatively awkward","overall, a very sweet and endearing movie (with freakishly cute animation), but it tries much too hard to stay true to the original story, while pushing the Shakespere angle WAY too hard. (""To be or not to be"" is uttered far too often). For those of you worried about the kiddies, don't worry, the ending isn't as dark as the original, but most children will lose interest long before then, from the pseudo-songs and irritating villain and best friend.Rent it, or at least wait so you don't have to shell out $20+."
5,Love this movie!,This is such a cute movie! My 2 and 6 year olds loved it. It kept them interested the whole time. Romeo was by far their favorite character. Would recommend to all ages! :)
4,Flawed but very beautiful and enchanting!,"I think this movie is very fun and enchanting to watch,although there are some scenes that didn't work out too well. Romeo's friends were a little overboard with the jokes I must agree but the other characters were pleasing like Friar Lawrence(as a sea otter! Too cute!) The kissing fish was cute,too,and the animation was done wonderfully for just one man who used Flash. Now that's impressive! So overall this movie has its flaws,but in a world of 3-d animated movies nowadays,this is a great refresher for anyone who missed the wonders of 2-d animation that capivated us quite a while ago."
2,so-so,"THe book was a little too long even though its short. I read it, but did not really enjoy it. I am hoping when I re-read it in a couple of months I will find it more interesting."
5,Lee and Miller Do It Again!!,"I'm always a bit wary when authors of a known series branch out into a new universe, but The Tomorrow Log did not disappoint. It's creatively and wonderfully written, with fully fleshed characters, fascinating personal relationships, and action-packed adventure to boot. The only disappointment is that it's only one book and we'll have to wait for the further adventures of Gem and Corbinye. If you love the Liaden series, you'll love The Tomorrow Log. And if you've never read any of the Liaden series .... what are you waiting for?!"
3,NOT THE SAME QUALITY.,"A 2002 review posted here states: ""The first thing I noticed was how well done the volume is. Heavy bonded paper, l0vely endpapers,three ribbon markers adorn the book. So it is pleasant to the eye and touch."" The 2011 edition which I just received though solid does not reflect the fine qualities which made the previous edition ""pleasant to eye and touch"". NO heavy bonded paper. NO lovely end papers. NO ribbon markers at all. The promise of that quality made the higher price attractive. I don't fault Amazon because the item description does not make these claims. I'm sure that the information will be valuable in itself but I am extremely disappointed that the book didn't live up to the review. I hope that this is helpful to future buyers."
4,Last of the Personal,"Orange is the not the easiest of albums; the most personal of all Al Stewart's work, but also the last of his truly autobiographical albums; his next phase was more experimental, more historical - and yes - more commercial.Orange was an acquired taste - many fans saw it as a sell out (at the time), as it was so smooth and professional compared with the first three.And smooth it is; a polished performance of well-written, intelligent lyrics with a backing from fine musicians.Many of us, born within a year or three of Al, could (and did) relate to his angst. Almost uniquely in my experience, this album seemed to talk equally to both male and female listeners.Finally, and this must be recorded for posterity, this is the album that spawned the 'Al Stewart Joke' on the UK folk club circuit: ""Tragedy - Al Stewart has a new girlfriend. [pause] That means another album."" They were only jealous!"
3,"Not his best, but still worth a listen","This is the first Al Stewart album to gain popularity. It is short (less than 40 min) and has a cover of a Dylan song, but still has some very nice early Stewart sounds. I would not recomend it for someone new to Stewart's music, but for the die hard fan, it might just be what you are looking for."
4,ALMOST THERE,"Here we find Al in 1972. He's almost to that point of really really great songwriting all the way around (He took brief moments in earlier albums on songs like ""Clifton In The Rain"" and ""A Small Fruit Song""). On ORANGE, his songs are still mostly love confessions, but still well worth hearing as he is beefing up his sound. Highlight songs ""Songs Out of Clay"", ""The News From Spain"" and ""Amsterdam""."
1,one of Al's weakest albums,"this is one of Al Stewart's weakest albums, but there are a couple of gems here, notably: Songs Out of Clay, Falling, and Night of the Fourth, also The News From Spain (although the News from Spain can also be found on the Modern Times import cd). Buy his other cds first"
2,2 defects in a row!,"Thought this looked like just what I needed, but when it arrived the plastic plug was boken/chipped near the negative terminal. Replacement (that came very quickly), had same defect. Appears the spring on the terminal is too strong for the plastic as manufactured. Returned second one for refund."
5,Just Fall in Love with it,"Sammi had use a different kind of singing technique in this CD. It showed all her fans that she has raise into a higher step in her career. A lot of songs in this CD had given us a mysterious feel. ""Wish You Happy"" was one of my favorite song, and was very popular in HK. ""Loving you is a dream of my life"" was another popular one written by a popular composer name Eddie Ng. ""Pets"" would give you a very bouncy rhythm and the lyrics are quite cute. I really do recommend this CD to people who haven't heard this yet!!"
5,Nice Vocal,This is a very good album to get if you like canto song. I don't want to say much. Get it now!
5,This comes very highly recommended!,"It's a great album. This album contains all great songs. ""Wish you happy"", ""The right lover"" and ""My pet"" are my favourites. Sammi has done a great job! Go buy it, you won't regret!"
2,Big disappointment,"Of the 325 pages of text, this book had only 54 pages relating specifically to Netscape's browser. I know readers need to be aware of the generalities of Internet surfing, but given the title of this book, I thought there would be more on the specifics of using this particular browser. I generally like the ""for Dummies"" series, but this was a disappointment."
1,This book is to general. Not Netscape Communicator specific,"This book had very little about Netscape Communicator. The three chapters that are devoted to Netscape Communicator tell you what it can do. It does not show you with examples. The majority of the book is about surfing the net, a little of HTML code, and examples of web sites. You can learn more accidentally by experimentation and on line help. My recommendation is save your money do not purchase this book."
1,Not enough material pertaining to Netscape Communicator.,I borrowed this book from the library hoping to gain some insight into Netscape Communicator. Little did I know I had inadvertently borrowed Internet for Dummies. A scant 3 chapters are devoted to Communicator and the rest of the book is internet reference material for various sites and a brief history of the internet.
1,Terrible,"This movie is atrocious, its worst than the first one and the acting is terrible. I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a good slasher flick. It wass a waste of 1 1/2 hours of my life which I will not get back. If you are looking for this as a sequel to the first movie S.I.C.K. with the exception of a homicidal clown there are no similarities."
1,Save Yourself the Trouble,"Seriously if you've seen S.I.C.K. and you actually enjoyed it and want to see the sequel, don't bother. It has no revelency between the two. I paid twenty bucks for this movie, it had a demented clown on the cover and seemed like it might be good. Instead the clown had no likeliness to the one on the cover. It was a low budget, sinlge camera movie. The acting was terrible and the plot was a mess which was slammed together in an hour and some change. It was awful and I wouldn't recommend you pay for this movie."
2,"Not has good as expected and another question, is this a sequel?","This movie was NOT even close to has good has it was made to look by the cover. And the camera quality SUCKSSSS!!!!! And the ending was totally comfusing. And is this a sequel to S.I.C.K.? i didnt think that movie was that great, but its better than this. If your expecting a good movie, AVOID!"
1,It was a cheap high school video project..,"My friends and I were at blockbuster and thought ""ok lets randomly pick a movie"" and there was Mr. Jingles. the video cover looked scary and the storyline sounded decent so we went ahead and rented it. As soon as we put the DVD in it was ridiculously bad. Credits roll in the beginning for about 8 hours, then a cheaply made movie shows up with really bad makeup and special effects. A middle schooler could have made better film. on top of the HORRIBLE beginning with the overuse of fake blood and sausages there was wayy too much talking. We havent finished the movie, just watch the first 20 minutes and thought why would we waste our lives watching the movie. went back to blockbuster and got our money back and rented another GOOD horror film."
1,This is not a real movie.,"I have no idea how this ""movie"" ever got a DVD release. It is very clearly shot on a consumer level MiniDV camera (auto focus blurring every shot, all outdoor shots are over exposed and grainy in low-light) without help from an external microphone. Every scene sounds like they recorded it in an echo chamber.The acting is by far the worst I've seen in any movie ever. I actually think it's a disservice actors everywhere to call this acting. It's closer to an hour and a half long high school TV station screen test. I can only come to the conclusion that someone got a mac for Christmas and made this in iMovie over the weekend.Clearly standards and DVD duplication costs have lowered. Do not see this movie under any circumstances, it's even too horrible to mock."
1,Everyday I Want to......,Everyday I want to kick myself for buying this stupid dvd. This movie sucks !!!!!!!!! Awful plot bad story line even worse acting If I could rate this movie any lower it would be negative 10 stars ! The actors looked like they were regular joes paid 5 bucks to say some lines on a movie screen- hell I could have acted better than these actors I would be Julliard compared to the cast !!!!!!!! Take my word for it and please save your money do not buy this movie !!!!!!!!
1,So horrible it's funny,"A few years back, my friend and I found this movie at blockbuster and I wanted to get it because the cover looked amazing and to scare my friend since she's deathly afraid of clowns. Sadly, the movie did NOT live up to it's cover. We waited until it was late and dark to watch it only to laugh out butts off! It's one of my favorite movies to hate. I give it one star cause it's not worth buying unless you want a horrible horrible movie in your collection to laugh at when you are feeling bad. The only reason I bought it was so I could laugh at the horrible acting, the ridiculous actors and the clown chopping of some guys genitalia and throwing it in the face of another guy. So funny XD Like I said, if you just want a great laugh and are making a top ten worst movie list, this is for you. If you want a good scare from a clown, go buy IT. Tim Curry is a scarier clown than this joker"
1,WtfOmfg,Oh my God!!! I have to agree with most of the other peoples reviews this isn't even a movie. It's a great time waster. My cousins and I rented this from Movie Gallery based on the cover which Looked pretty cool.....at the time. Only to realize by watching about maybe 5 minuets of this movie that it was very s**ty and not worth our .66 cents to rent it. We know that we can make a better movie with my panasonic with far better acting and better plot and everything.
3,AN EXTREMELY ENTERTAINING AND FUN MOVIE,"Forget all the bad reviews, this low-budget,cheesy horror-comedy is actually very funny and gory(a plus for gorehounds). After being sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit, a clown named Mr. Jingles turns into a psychopathic killer to take revenge on the people who sent him away,and the usual immoral teens in these horror movies. The film,despite the gritty image,isn't all bad,it includes some really good kills(A woman gets her intestines cut out,axes to the head,a boy getting his penis cut off,and a boy getting his back jumped on until he spews out blood). The acting was mediocre by some,horrible by others(the police chief and the mother). The best acting comes from the nu-metal/stoner slacker pals who do nothing but smoke weed and listen to music until they get killed. Mr. Jingles is a cross between Freddy Krueger/IT,but he is very funny especially that hysterical laugh he does. Just rent and enjoy this movie. [...]"
1,The only review you would ever need,If i could go back in time and make a choice between watching this movie and suicide.... I just wonder if my funeral would have been nice.
1,Bad,This movie has less quality and lower cinematoraphy than one of my back yard family videos. REALLY!
1,Peerless is Garbage,"This thing is a total piece of crap. None of the metal parts fit together well and the finish is horrible. The cast iron grates on top are uneven and cause your pots and pans to wobble and make noise when you cook. I wish I didn't have to buy a 36"" range...this is the only affordable one out there and I can tell why. Spend the extra $600 and buy anything but this. Everytime I use it I am disappointed. You really do get what you pay for."
1,Low quality and overpriced,"I purchased the 36 inch stove in 2006. There weren't many reviews online and I went by looks and the decent ""press"". The range is as others described - junk. Sheet metal thin, poor engineering tolerances, sharp edges, chincey parts, and the clock broke on day 1. The only decent part of the stove is the cast iron grates. Like someone else I could see the insulation peaking out the seems in the oven compartment. The broiler is especially atrocious. The rail the drawer runs on are built like a cheap $30 file cabinet. The whole thing is built this way. A fair price for this range is $300-$400. I replaced it with a mid level Maytag $800 - something decent but not great. However, it was head and shoulders a better stove. Really like going from a Ford Pinto to a Rolls Royce. This stove is that bad!"
4,Different than the usual but a great read,The story line was different from your typical novel which was great. The characters clearly lived by their faith which is sometimes not evident of some of the 'christian romance' novels. I would definitely recommend.
3,It was OK,"The book was a slow read for me. To be honest if I knew that I might not have downloaded this book. The main characters are from two different worlds. Her family is mostly Poppy the man that pretty much raised her as her parents where not there for her. I actully wanted to slap her parents for the stupid things they said to her especially her mother. Maybe it was because they were from money that made them so irritating. For him, he is a Mexican who is poor that needs to help his family to keep them fed and housed. You keep trying to figure out how everything is going to end until the very end. I was disappointed in the ending but overall it was a decent book. If you are not spirtual in anyway then I would not suggest this book to you. The book is spirtual and uplifing."
4,Looks like a good book,"I download a lot of books to my Kindle Fire, but since I work full time I don't get to read as much as I would like to. Therefore I have not read this book as of yet, but am looking forward to doing so. I would not have purchased this book without reading the description of the book, so feel this will be a good one when I get around to reading it."
3,Teacher & Engineer,"If the book's price is slightly lower than the current one, I would give this book a 4 star rating. However,it is a good additional book the Solid Mechianics to your library."
1,Not very good,"This book was not very good at all. The author can't seem to go more than a few pages without intejecting some vulgarity, and the side bar stories are sometimes just plain cruel. I would not recommend this book to anyone who was looking for information on the state of the workplace today. Save your money."
5,Grand Game Theft for the 3rd time,"Yet again, GTA 3 reveals awesome graphics and intense gameplay as induced by it's predecssoers. GTA 3 highlights great never ending fun as you race around liberty city in a none stop race against time from the police and running around crime syndicates. Great fun!"
4,High Hopes,"The GTA games for the GBC were pretty average. It was essentialy like GTA for PC only bad. If the GBA version could do something like run off of the GTA2 engine, it will be a fine game. But if the designers go off and try to reinvent the game, I can pass on this one."
5,Grand theft auto3 rules!,I think Grand Theft Auto 3 is going to be great! Because I've played it on the PS2.
3,Carjacking could never be more fun...,"Unless you've played a GTA game. I've played GTA3 and own GTA, so I'm sure it'll be good. Considering the GBA graphics, it'll probly be a chopper view. The game should be fun to play. So back off.Added Feb. '03...Now that Vice City is out, the game should be a HUGE hit for GBA, maybe even better than Metroid Fusion. Expect it to be on the Top Ten GBA Titles list for a while. Maybe Nintendo Power could review it. That would get it off to a great start."
4,C'mon...,"Okay you guys. This is NOT a game by Rockstar Games. Grand Theft Auto 3 for the Game Boy Advance is by Destination Software, developers of Game Boy Advance games ONLY. Earlier games from Destination Software include Smugglers Run and Sim City 2000 and many others. I think this game's gonna kick ... on the GBA, and I'm totally asking for this for Christmas. I haven't even seen any screenshots!"
3,how do you know,man how do all you guys know its going too be 3d. but all you guys who say its not going to be 3d how the hell do you know that. i think all you guys should not even talk until you guys have actually played the game
1,AWFUL!,"We bought 100 bags of this awful sweet and sour cotton candy for a work event, and I have never heard so many complaints in my life! I tasted some, and there is definitely something wrong with the recipe!"
4,'69 Plymouth Barracuda brings back memories!,"This 1/18th scale Yat Ming 1969 Plymouth Barracuda will bring back memories of a bygone era, the Muscle Car '60's. Precise details, a sweet candy apple red and black paint job, along with the white racing stripe with Barracuda and 383 emblazoned on the sides make this 'Cuda a real eye catcher. The price was a great value, and with my Prime Shipping already paid for the year, made this buy a ""Good Buy""."
2,Not a Best Seller,"Simmons relates the power of Native American witchcraft through a series of short stories and tales that have been told for centuries. While these stories are interesting to read and very intriguing, it is not a very comprehensible way of detailing the history of Native American witchcraft. This book needed more organization and fact. To improve the book, Simmons could have gone into medical practices a bit more to describe spells, herbs, cures, etc. He also could have described how the Spanish and Native American religious priests regarded the practice then and now."
5,Great classic family entertainment,"Dan Haggerty shot to instant stardom in the late 1970's with his tough-yet-compassionate mountain man persona in the CBS TV Series ""Grizzly Adams."" I think many of us wish that they made shows like this one again. Meanwhile, if you want a taste of enjoyable, family-friendly adventure, journey with two ""modern kids"" who are transported back in time through a magical cave to the land of yesteryear and the wild, wild west of Grizzy Mountain. Really lots of fun!"
1,Stupid movie that made no sense!,"Dan Haggerty was the best actor in that movie and did a good job acting in it. On the other hand it was poorly written and the rest of the actors and actresses in the movie did a terrible job. It made no sense at all. Some lousy acting kids got mysteriously sent back in time to save a mountain from being blown into pieces. It's funny how the kids were trying to save the mountain from being blown when it already existed in the 20th century. Then the writer made a lousy attempt to make the movie funny by making the kids have all sorts of gadgets and gizmos from the future. It could have been a great movie with Dan Haggerty since I thought some of his earlier movies were great, but the plot was terrible and the ""kids from the future"" made it even worse."
1,"mountain ""pristine,"" not ""grizzly"" at all",This movie is in no way related to Grizzly Adams. My family and I were greatly disappointed. A mere three billion thumbs up.
1,The scenery's the star of this lousy film,"I never thought Dan Haggerty could act . . . now I know for sure! And he was the best on in the entire cast of so-called actors.Sure the story has a politically correct message, but the challenge is sticking with it to the end. This poorly written, poorly acted, low budget affair would have been a total waste of time except for some great scenery. Save your money."
2,"Ordered this, but what I got wasn't like the picture","I don't know if it was a mix-up in shipping or a mix-up in photography, but I ordered this and got just an ordinary press-in trem arm WITHOUT the socket assembly."
5,another brilliant carey novel,"Carey's novels are so dark. I'm seduced by the prose and the situations but always find myself achingly wondering how I can bear to read more about the horrible histories of the characters and the tragic relationships between them. Mostly the characters start off seemingly likeable but the more I read the less I can identify with them.The Tax Collector is another brilliant Peter Carey book, thankfully with a glimpse of hope in the mostly appalling ending. I'm glad there are still some more Carey novels left that I haven't read!"
1,advice: read something else,"""The Tax Inspector"" is not a pleasant read. It's a story about a family damaged by incest making its final descent into hell, and it's also about a very pregnant woman who stumbles into this mess at the worst possible time.I don't mind the subject matter being dark and all, but spending time with so many ugly characters in such an ugly setting - a run-down car dealership/garage - for over 300 pages is just painful and unrewarding. The ""explosive"" ending is a joke."
2,Sound and fury signifying nothing.,"I really liked Illywhacker by Carey, and I really liked the movie Bliss, based on his novel by the same name (both of the above highly recommended) but I was thoroughly disappointed with ""The Tax Inspector"". After finishing this novel I wanted to rip it up, so no-one after me would find it in my library. Perhaps I am being too harsh. The novel does contain several interesting characters, but I found it to be ultimately pointless, with no real meaning. Read this only if you must read everything by Mr. Carey."
3,Just average,"Some of the songs are just like the original. I was expecting different arrangement to fit Foster & Allen better.However, if you like the 60's this is the cd you'll enjoy listen to."
5,Great out of the box ideas,Rick will make you think about how you do church in this book. A must read if you are re-evaluating your ministry or if you feel stuck in a rut.
5,just what i needed!,"this book came to me at the perfect time. i am a part of a church plant in a beach resort area and mike's experience and ideas were extremely helpful. the chapter on ""herding cats"" was helpful in reshaping my outlook on the average american christian today.i think mike achieved his goal in inspiring us to think outside the box and in getting our creative juices flowing. i recommend this book to anyone in ministry and anyone wishing to get a glimpse into the heart of ministers today who genuinely desire to bring the lost into fellowship with Jesus Chrsit and other believers. Maybe it will inspire some ""bench-warmers"" to get out of their seats and serve, as well!"
2,Not impressed with this Sony camera,"I bought this camcorder and have exchanged it three times. The first one I bought before I even had it a full week broke and had an error message I called sony and they informed me I would have to send it in to be fixed! Uh, NO, I think I'll take a new one, thanks! made the mistake of exchanging instead of just returning! the second camera had audio problems which, come to the third to find out that this is just the sound ""non""-quality of this camcorder. There is an everpresent frog croking noise in the audio of the recording from the camcorder that I was informed is the gears from the dvd and is supposed to be there, they turned the mic level down in hopes of it not picking the noise up, didn't help. I would buy a different camera or just get a cheap mini dv since they seem to make these things to be replaced every two years!"
2,What the Funk 'Nard??,"I don't get it. Bernard Wright is one of the funkiest guys on the planet. When I heard he became a Christian and had a gospel album out I literally jumped for joy. What a disappointment.Flat, unimaginative and definitely not funky. Buy Nard's old stuff. Nothing here.If you want funky gospel get ""Share the News"" by ex-Funkadelic Calvin Simon. That's the BOMB!"
3,Good Effort from an Obscure Artist,"Rally Ral stayed on the Hip Hop scene just long enough to get one of his tracks included on the Street Fighter soundtrack. This particular single was produced by none other than artist E-A-Ski from Oakland, and is a solid effort.At first listen, you might mistake Rally Ral for fellow Bay Area artist Spice 1, save for the fact that their lyrical styles are completely different. Rally Ral released no solo albums nor other singles outside of this one, although he's presently the CEO of Wee Drop Ent, an Oakland-based label. Overall, this was a good effort by a new artist, it would have been interesting to hear more from him."
3,Ultimate Guide to Sewing Dance Competition Costumes,"I thought this book was useful, yet I would have liked to have seen more diagrams for the actual preperation of creating and making the costumes, rather than just the completed costume. There was a lot of information for finding help in selecting the right fabrics, etc., however I was a little disapointed that there just wasn't enough visual help with the directions."
5,Book Review,Very good instruction for the mom who turns into the studio costume sewing mom. Lots of good hints and tips for sewing costume material.
3,Kreg KBK-IP Bench Klamp Insert Plate,"I bought one Klamp and four Insert Plates for it. The system works well expect for one thing, the insert plates are of different thichness. I micrometered the plates and found them to be as much as 0.006"" in thickness difference. And, the plates are not flat (even thickness across the width). What this means is that if you have the Klamp screw set for one insert plate thickness, then when the Klamp is moved to the next insert plate it may not fit or be sloppy in it fit. I like Kreg stuff, which is generally of high quality and more costly than its competitors. This issue is a Kreg quality control problem that they should address."
4,perfect alignment,Keeps all the pieces together to insure perfect alignment. The portability lets you take the clamp to a convenient and large surface for assembly. The floor works well for long pieces.
5,"My friend recommended this book. It arrived in great shape, still to read it....","My friend recommended this book. It arrived in great shape, still to read it....It's supposed to be full of great information. I wonder if I will ever unlock its treasures? SO many other books on the to read list."
3,If you like Japanese pop rock...,"I'd say if you like Japanese pop rock, you will probably like this album. All of my Japanese exchange student friends have heard it, but like all fads in Japan after one week it's history. These two are actually comedians that were really popular. Anyways, there is one track that I really like with some hip hop influence. Other than that the rest of the cd is enjoyable to listen to but not mind blowingly great."
5,Great Deal,"Excellent deal, product was better than rated, shipped fast, and was a very good price. I would do business with again."
4,Good But,Zen of Watering Your GardenThis is a really goodthe book to start flower photography with. It does teach most significantly how to achieve effective composition. Unfortunately it is out of date in the digital world.Nature's beauty is everywhere not just in flowers and that it can be captured relatively simply using new and inexpensive digital cameras particularly those with image stability and macro functions built in.I prefer these flowers and other subjects of Nature to be shot as they are and not in still lifes etc.I published an entire collection of photos without any manipulation except cropping to fit the page. Matt Cohen
5,A great insight on flower photography for few bucks,"Recommended! Nice introduction to flower photography, especially because of the framing advice... Won't regret it!"
5,Extremely detailed,"This is the best travel guide about Viennna on the market. The Eye Witness Travel books are all excellent. About popular attractions in Vienna, you will find information about hours of when places are open, public transportation stops closest to the attraction, color illustrations, photos and maps of the attractions. There are restaurants and hotels references listed in the book, as well as how to use the public transportation system and the airport. There are also city and subway maps in the book. It will be the only guidebook you will need to take to Vienna."
1,teeth lasted about 5 minutes,I was cutting some annealed 3/32 1095 steel and about 12 teeth came off while making the first cut. I have never had this problem with olson blades.
1,poor craftsmanship,The item does not seal at the top so it leaks when you flip it over. will not stay snaped.waste of my money
1,BAD,"This contain holds water yes, but only if you can seal the lid back on. the lip in the seal is almost impossible to seal. I threw it in the garbage and am now looking for a better one."
1,not happy with product,"The good...the product did arrive on time and was well packaged. The bad...the container doesn't seal well. When I fill the container with water, it spills out when I try to flip it over to put in the dispensing tray."
2,its okay,didnt work like i wanted it too or expected taped it shut or water will spill all over very tricky to use not easy to fill and put back together
3,"Cheap, but works","The actual water feeder is rounder, but more apealing than the one in the picture.What i didn't like about it is that it's a hastle to snap the lid onn and if you don't snap tightly, it will not work. The water will spill and the system will fail.I'm just glad that i'll have to deal with that only once a week or so. Hopefully i don't break it after 2-3 uses just trying to put the lid on."
4,Great Product Unless You have a Curious CAT!,"I've bought this same water feeder for years now. My first cat has a running water fetish where he won't drink anything unless it's from a faucet. This became annoying when I was cooking and he'd jump on the countertops (not very sanitary!). The waterer was a big hit with him.Then came the other cat...I bought a new one (the other one broke after some time) when my husband and I went on a trip for five days. I filled it up and put it down by the other water bowl and immediately the younger cat( she's a playful 2.5 years old ) started batting at the bobber at the bottom of the bowl. This mechanism lifts up and down based on air pressure/bubbles that raise and lowers the water. However funny this sounds, she got water everywhere on the wood floor! She wouldn't leave well enough alone and it reduced me to putting it away.I still rate this four stars as it really keeps the water fresher. If you have overly active or playful cats, this item isn't for you."
4,fun,"This game is fun and has great graphics. You are trying to solve a mystery in a mansion and you get to go through the mansion! It looks real too on the inside because the graphics are soooo good! You talk to people in the mansion and ask them questions to try to find out who did it. There are also many puzzles to solve. One really bad thing is this game goes by chapter(like the books) and you cannot save during a chapter because you have to get the passwrd after every chapter to start where you left off. This is bad in case of emergencies and it can also take forever to complete a chapter. Overall,it is really neat and fun."
3,An O.K Game,"If you are a fan of the computer games, then you might like this. I finished the game in one day because i had played it on the computer so much. The music is crappy and VERY repetitive. I had to mute it after a while. There arent many sound effects at all....maybe two through the whole game...one would be a ghost and the other would be a fire (the sound is so you know it is a fire, otherwise you might think it is a ghost!)The graphics are okay...I guess they would be considered GOOD for a GBA game...One thing though is when you talk to the characters, they dont move. They stay in one awkward postition the whole time.All in all, I'd say that the only reason I enjoyed this game is because I am a Nancy Drew fan and a big fan of the computer game series! If you are not a fan of the computer games, then don't waste your money because you SURE won't like this. There are better mystery games out there."
4,COOL!!!!,"THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!IT'S NANCY DREW LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE!!SNOOP ALAROUND THE MANSION,TALK WITH ALL THE SUSPECTS,UNCOVER THE SECRET OF PAST IN THE MANSION,AND DISCOVER WHOSE CAUSING ALL THE 'ACCIDENTS'.THIS IS ONE OF THOSE GAMES THAT KEEPS YOU ON YOUR TOES!!!"
4,It wasn't as good as others,"nancy drew... is genius! but having the computer games was good enough. now its for gameboy and it just wasn't as exciting as a lot of the computer nancy drew games. overall i'd say, from a 13 year old, this game, buy it for your computer."
4,"great concept, but...","I am a 31 yr old female gamer. Just so you know where I a coming from...I enjoy the concept and idea of this game and it is true that the graphics are great, but it is way too dark in a lot of parts of it and I find myself holding it just right to try to see, even with one of those game boy lights. Growing up with Nancy Drew books I would buy this game even with that down fall. I hope they come out with more mystery games like this one. It is nice to be able to find myself thinking about who is behind the accidents and where to find clues and excited when I find more. The no save feature does not bother me because it is easy to start in the beginning of each chapter and get caught up to where you left off. I hope this was helpful."
3,it was good but not as good as the computer games,"the games was good, but very hard to play. you had to finish a chapter before you could save and if you did anything in the chapter that was ahead of its time and quit, when you typed in the password it wouldn't be done, so you would have to do it all over again. overall it was a good game but i would reccomend playing it on the computer instead!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Guitar School by Jerry Snyder,This was the wrong book I needed for class but I can use it at home. He is a great teacher and his books are easy to follow.
5,"Make your Christmas one ""from the heart"".","Martha Stewart presents some of the most beautiful andcreative ideas to make Chirstmas special. Her gift andwrapping ideas allow for the kind of creativity that willmake each gift truly special and ""from the heart"".Thedecorating ideas she presents are truly beautiful and havegiven rise to many new holiday traditions in our homeand in the homes of the many friends that have borrowedthis book from me. The fact that she provides the names andaddresses of the mail order houses she gets her suppliesfrom for all of the wonderful things she shows in the bookis a god-send."
5,Look don't Touch,"This isn't a 'play with' toy so much as a look at toy, which is EXACTLY why i bought it for an adult. She loves moon phases and this is great for her. The detail is awesome and comes pre-assembled in a fantastic box!"
4,decent product terrible labeling,"this oil works well. it is definately worth the price. Good overall quality, good price.however, the labeling is really bad.because i have several machines, some are 2 stroke with gas/oil 2:1, some are regular gas and seperate oil, and some are 40:1 mix. So i have three seperate gas containers for the three different gas mixes.This product label the 40:1 so small and in the dumbest place on the back on the bottom. It should be boldly place on the front. I just glad that I needed it right away and mixed becaus in a hurry I would have had a problem finding the mix and could have easily mistaken it for 2:1."
4,"I need more, too","Iggy is the man.. plain and simple. No one will ever be like him. We all know about his crazy stage antics, so I won't get into that.This autobiography is great. It tells about his life in Detroit, some of his crazy stories, including when he lost his virginity (which is hilarious). He also talks about shows with the Stooges, which is very entertaining. However, the book is short, and Iggy has a unique way of writing. It may take some getting used to, but I recommend this book to any lover of Iggy Pop, the Stooges, or just a good book."
1,Less is not More,"If you want a transcript of an interesting cat talking into a tape recorder for a few hours, check this out. Practically no information of interest or entertainment to be had here. Just an extension of style far, far better served by listening to the great music he's produced over the years. Stick to that unless you want a graphically puffed up magazine article, as presented in this ""book""."
4,good but...,"The movie is well done. I liked it.BUTIf you expect Home Alone you are in for a disapointment. Granted - It has the same plot as Home Alone, but that plot came from Die Hard. Don't be surprised when the movie turns out to be more like Die Hard than Home Alone. I'm always annoyed when perfectly good movies are falsely advertised."
5,Great deal,"I needed a toner cartridge for an obsolete Zerox copier. Amazon linked me to a vendor in Austin Tx. The cartridge was delivered in two days even though I requested regular shipping. Great deal, fast delivery. I recommend this product and vendor."
2,I was tricked by this one,"The DVD is just a presentation where a speaker talks about different shows of the British Comedy. I was expecting to see a presentation and then the complete shows, but instead they are just small parts (a few seconds) of the mentioned shows."
2,Left out a lot.,"This DVD was a Christmas gift a couple of years back, and I can remember being very disappointed with it. The host was Lenny Henry, who was undoubtedly good in his own show, but lacked timing and delivery, consequently falling flat on this DVD. Second, there were quite a few so-called 'blokes' missing from this special.Michael Palin- A very talented all around British actor without whom a lot of John Cleese sketches would have failed to function.Terry Jones- With Palin, director of the successful series 'Ripping Yarns'.Eric Morecambe & Ernie Wise- How could you have a television special about British comedy and leave out Morecambe & Wise?Bruce Forsyth- Come one, let's not forget Brucie, he's been sround for longer than many of these poeple.They mentioned Nigel Hawthorne, but I don't remember seeing much of Paul Eddington in here."
4,A simple compilation filled with many laughs,"While not the most comprehensive collection out there, this is a great compilation of some of the funniest people ever to enter into the Brit-com genre. It's not an indepth look into any of their careers or an overabundance of any amount of their time on the screen, but a good glimpse at who are the funniest and best British actors in the Comedy genre. A good watch, but by no means a recap of their work so much as an introduction to who you should be watching more of."
3,show clips,I thought it was going to be an episode for each of the featured menInstead it is a well done bio with clips from their showsHappy with my purchase
2,An Astonishingly Bad Film: Destined for Cult Status,"This relic from 1980, a soft porn disco melodrama about hookers working a seedy British nightclub, is destined for cult status. Helen Mirren portrays a prostitute raising a small child, with no cliché left unmolested. Standard soap opera stuff, sprinkled with dreadful ""musical"" numbers at the night club, containing just enough nudity to make the enterprise bearable. This film is full of unintentional laughs, many from the ultra-cheesy fashions and conventions of the era. However, it is almost worth watching just to hear Helen Mirren repeat the line, ""Make love to me!"" at random intervals whenever some gratuitous nudity is in order.The quality of the DVD transfer is barely adequate and is presented in full screen format. For fans of Helen Mirren and bad films only, this film is a rare instance where the two converge."
4,Worth it JUST to see an early Helen Mirren!,"Was the movie deep? No.Was it thought provoking? Nope.Beautifully shot with lucious scenery? Negative.Was it a good example of movies of the era, including cheesy disco song & dance? Yup!If nothing else, worth viewing to show you the ""before"" Helen Mirren to serve as the baseline for her performances in later films."
3,"Nice performance, poor recording quality","Especially in the quieter pieces, there is a lot of recording noise and the sound is not a clear as I would like. Appears the recording dates from 1987 which might explain it.I'm listening using an O2/ODAC + Sennheiser HD565 Ovation headphones.Also the level is very low requiring high volume/gain settings; unless you have a silent system you may gain yet more noise there."
5,Excellante,"The best CD ever i heard before. This album i had purchase in cassatte format long time ago. Now available in CD formate. Boney M group is very famous still date european and asian music lover love this group. This alubum take you to the 10,000 light years journey to the space. Very high thinking in the lyrics for all generation of music lover and the people thinking beyond new generation of space. The best album... Boney M... Thanku for the music"
4,space disco,a fabulous lost album - in fact one of boney M's best. Gemrnay started space disco and it is deep in the DNA of this disk.
5,Amazing,"I would reccomend reading some of Russian history (around the time period when Stalin was president) otherwise it would be difficult to understand some parts and what Tolstaya is talking about.I read this book in Russian and English, and of course the english translation is not nearly as good as the original Russian. However, the story is still amazing, and I love how she uses irony, and makes fun of certain concepts-it's sad, but funny at the same time!"
3,Not a book for Kernel Driver Developer,"This book tells me what RootKit really means. One useful thing I got from this book was that in Windows Kernel even simple code can be used against security. And that's it. Most techniques in this book are primitive to kernel developers. I don't recommend this book to serious kernel driver developers. ""Windows Internals"" and OSR Online should be the way to go."
2,"Missing something. My guess a fluent thought. Sparatic, and Suggestive at best...","Nice cover. Not recommended. Poorly written. Reads like a gamer wrote it, not a professional programmer. Neato ideas with a lot of fluff, no substance."
5,Awesome Japanese music compilation,"Shonen Knife shines as always, as well as the other bands and this awesome tribute to the creator of some of Japan's most treasured animation"
2,These are big and for Schraeder valves,bought these to use on Presta valves but they only fit Schraeder so I returned them for a full refund. They would look totally silly on my bike and probably really only for a motorcycle because they are so large.Great service getting my refund though!
4,good value in speakers,"Good deal. My wife's 1987 Volvo is noisy enough at this point that these are great for her vehicle. Inexpensive, loud enough and pretty good tone."
3,Fun but limiting,"The best thing about this is the design, but the arms connecting the screen and keyboard look odd when the unit is closed. The screen is fairly dim, and must be used in a dark/moderately lit room. The viewing angle of the screen is horrible; the only position you can see the whole screen without an inversion/blackout effect is at an angle where any overhead lighting glares all over the place. The CPU speed isn't particularly slow, but the graphics ([re]drawing the screen) goes on at an awful crawl - i.e. it's no good for graphical things. Now I must sound entirely bitter and biased against this machine, but I'm not, I carry it in my bag all the time and use it when I can. I even use it as an electronic book, its best use so far."
4,Do I love it or hate it ?,"I bought my Tripad last year and at the time it was my sole computer for PIM, Internet word processing. Unfortunately a good concept in design is let down by so-so software and slow proceesing. 70Mhz was slow even for its time what with the Jornada 820 at 190Mhz. Most applications tend to hang if too many are opened simultaneously and Sharp's machine does not contain most of the goodies that are standard with the vadem clio. Lastly the machine weighs a ton and the only person who could use this machine on the fly would be jesse ventura or hulk hogan. On the other hand it has a tremendous wow factor, ipaq notwithstanding. both a pcmcia and a cf slot and although you cannot install the microdrive it has enough room for memory expansion. a StrongARM processor with 206 Mhz, 64 MB RAM, Windows CE 3.0 and lose a pound of weight and you can be the king of the world. as is it is only a mediocre performer."
4,Good atmosphoere and story.,"If you enjoy Taipei movies here is one for you! I greatly enjoyed this movie. The atmosphere of the scenes makes me feel like I'm in interesting places. Some casual, some cozy, some charged with tension and for sure exotic. Shu Qi makes the movie worth a watch indeed. She is quite good in this one. The other performers do a splendid job too. I've long been interested in Taiwan so I'm given to favoring such movies. Having watched many Asian movies I can connect to the story. I rented this video. I may decide to buy a copy for myself. Mabey I'll buy a second copy to send to a friend. Best enjoyed while eating instant noodles with chopsticks! Smile!"
3,the cure for insomnia,"I gave it 3 stars because the cinematography is beautiful as photography.Also if you suffer from insomnia, get this. I tried to watch it 3 times 3 evenings in a row and had to go to bed before I finally finished it the 4th afternoon.The slowest paced movie I have EVER seen.It makes ""Lost in Translation"" seem Action-Packed.The score is similar to ""Lost in Translation."" Could switch them and not tell the difference. But ""Lost in Translation"" has a lot more going on.I don't know exactly what happened in this movie. The girl, Vicki, is very beautiful. She has a boyfriend who is mean to her. She leaves him and Jack, a Yakuza type, takes care of her. What happens, I'm just not sure.I watched the extended scene that was availabe in the Special Features and that didn't help clarify much.Everybody is beautiful to look at and nothing shocking happens. The snow landscapes are lovely."
3,Ho-Hum,"Interesting come to mind. Beautiful comes to mind. Great acting comes to mind. Artful comes to mind. Great plot does not come to mind, nor does meaningful. That is the major problem with this film about a girl who basically does nothing but smoke and drink. I would say Shu Qi is a truly great actress and amazing beauty. Too bad her talent is wasted on a film with literally no plot. This film, like many other films of its kind, tries to fool you with pretty packaging and serious problems to devert your attenchion away from the fact that their is zero meaning in the movie. no lession, no feelings, no reflection. Nothing. Its a little like a painting i suppose. its beautiful, but it stands still and motionless. You can only stare at a beautful painting for so long before you want to stare at something else, and you can only watch this movie for so long before you want to watch something just as pretty but emotional."
2,Good Acting But The Story Is So Dry,"It's hard to review Millennium Mambo and explain the disappointment it gave you. It truly feels like your watching a surveillance tape of some girl and her troubles that don't appear to be that bad due to the lack emotion and feeling that the story is full of . It's so slow and like another reviewer said it does takes you days to force yourself to watch it. The first ten minutes of partying and pacing from the characters make you want to find something else to do. There's no real plot or conflict in the film to make it a story and by the end of it you just wasted your time. There literally is no excitement or any emotion to make you feel it so all that stuff on the DVD case like the words Deeply Moving is a lie. I don't think it was the acting but more the directing and story were too dry, trust me when say it's not worth watching even once."
5,Muy buen libro,"Este libro me parecio muy bueno porque es un libro muy facil y dinamico y muy rico en contenido. Las imagenes son muy claras y me permite realizar yoga en casa teniendo en cuenta mi tipo fisico, solo hago las posiciones que me favorecen."
5,One of the best yoga books out there...,I had the pleasure of doing a weekend workshop with Ms. Kozak a few years ago after reading this book. I find myself constantly referring to it when I have questions about the doshas or the poses in general. You will not be disappointed in this book.
1,Very disappointed,"The picture shows three brushes. A different order shows a dozen brushes for about $15. So, I assumed I would get three brushes, based on the cost. Only one came. And that was not a good quality brush, to boot. A lot of the bristles were different lengths, and some stuck up/down farther than they should have. Before it can be used, this brush needs a haircut to get the bristles approximately the same length."
2,Hard bristles,"The bristles are hard and do not soften under warm water. It cannot be hung from a hook. This listing is for one brush, not three."
3,OK product,"This is a great necklace and comes in nice packaging, perfect for gifts. The downfall is that the necklace chain came to me in knots that I haven't been able to completely undo."
1,First I received the correct VSH case with the wrong tape in it,"I received the correct VHS Case with the wrong movie inside of it, not only that the tape I received was disgusting. It looked like insects have been living in it, I mean out right nasty to the point where I'm scared to keep it in my house until I received the return label to send it back. So these people or store are not clean at all. I have a child who suffers with Autism and this ruined his whole day. I'm so upset over this situation"
2,They let me Keep A VIDEO I Didn't want,I wasn't satisfied with this company. They did give me the shipping refund of $2 and some change but they took awhile to contact me regarding their discrepany to give me a video vs a DVD and then they were like just keep it and here's your shipping. That isn't what I asked for so...What the Heck! Buyer beware if its not worth their time or money's worth they aren't going to make it right.
2,Not wood,It looks like wood in the photo and know it would not be but it really does not look like wood in person. Loks cheap. Would not buy it again.
5,Get this book!,"Luis Alberto Urrea's touching poem could only be matched by Jose Galvez's stirring photographs, pictures that depict both the soft sides and the machismo of Latino men. This makes a wonderful Father's Day gift and is a must-have for the thoughtful coffee table."
5,Great weed fabric,"We have nearly an acre in Boulder, Colorado, and did an informal experiment 2 years ago with 4 different kinds of weed fabric around our raised beds. By this spring it was obvious that the DeWitt weed fabric was by far the best -- it was the only one with absolutely no weeds growing through it, despite mulch that was blown away by the wind and left much of the weed fabric exposed for months. One of the weed fabrics of similar price has actually disintegrated during this time, and all of them except the DeWitt have weeds coming through. We only buy this one now -- it's easy to handle, pins down well with the staples, and really holds up to block weeds. Be sure to get the 20-year (4 oz) or similar - even DeWitt comes in less expensive, lighter weight versions. Don't know how those would hold up."
3,Time will tell so I give it 3 stars for now,"We are fed up with weeding, even though we have barrier paper down. I hope this does what it says it will. More to follow in a few months once it has been down a while and fingers crossed, no weeds."
2,Uneven Disco Collection,"Most of these songs are available on better and more comprehensive disco collections, such as Rhino Records' excellent series, ""The Disco Years."" A brutally edited version of Silver Convention's ""Fly Robin Fly"" only adds insult to injury."
5,An Eng Lit grad student review,"Author is good at explaining visuals in Shakespeare and their connection to language.Book contents have extensive reference notes and index, but no illustrations or diagrams.Ch1: Visual Interpretation: Text and ContextCh2: The Language of Costume and Hand PropertiesCh3: The Language of Gesture and ExpressionCh4: The Language of Theatrical SpaceCh5: The Language of CeremonyCh6: ""Maimed Rites"": Violated Ceremony in HamletCh7: Epilogue"
3,LOVE Liberty's KIds !! Why still so expensive ??,"Why is A 60-minute DVD $40 ?? Liberty's Kids are great! Make these available to the masses -same as aired in television saturday mornings- at a reasonable cost- so that our families may enjoy them! Soon!!Amendment 10/06: These can now be found inexpensively. Highly recommended, excellent and easy way for children to learn History by all-star character voice actors."
2,Too preachy,"Ok ok we get it. Breastfeeding is better than formula, but do you really have to waste an entire redundant section on it? Additionally wasted are the pages on jarred foods. I truly believe a book that boasts ""Whole Foods for Babies and Toddlers"" should be just that. While I would have appreciated a paragraph on your arguments for natural foods and breastfeedings; I started to get annoyed when I realize that most of this book is just that. I have a 14 month old and am desperate for reciepes for him and our whole family. I feel that this book needed more receipes and less opions. PS. Most of us that are ""Whole food"" cooking for our kids are already on board with the previously mentioned issues."
3,Am I the only person totally confused by this book?,"I just dug through my baby cookbooks looking for a recipe for crackers. I made one out of this book, it called for honey. So, I assume because there's no warning on this recipe, that honey must be okay for under a year when it's baked, right? Wrong, it's not. Why is it that out of the five baby food cookbooks I own, not a one of them does an adequate job of explaining the theory behind waiting to introduce certain foods? Infact all the books I own have different introduction schedules! So, I'm just completely confused. And now that I've fed my baby honey I'm irritated as well.The recipe is good though, my preschooler and I like it."
2,Better to Check it out - Don't buy,"I found a lot of the information dated compared with other books I have read, recently. There are very few pictures/illustrations and what's there is boring black and white. I would have been better off checking this out of a library and not buying it."
1,Not Helpful,I'm looking for some advice and recipies for my 9 month old - not preaching on why we shouldn't buy pre-made baby food. This was of no help to me and i made my first book return to amazon. I'd keep looking if I were you.... this book preaches to the choir.
3,A bit outdated,"This book decrys the baby food industry for all of the sugar, salt, additives, and preservatives that go into the food. While it might have been so in previous decades, I think baby food companies have made tremendous strides in their food. However, I do make most of my baby's food because I think it is more nutritious and he likes it better so the book does have some good recipes."
1,not Mac compatible and they don't care,"This camera is not Mac compatible, the Samsung technicians know it, and they don't care -- at least the one I spoke with didn't care about the fact that I was out $500. It states nowhere on their Amazon page or the Samsung website that this camera doesn't work on Mac systems. It's false advertising, and they're rude on top of it. What a waste of time and money, not to mention I can't get my video and still images off the camera before returning it. Who makes a new camera these days that's not Mac compatible? Samsung = so lame."
4,Loved jerry growing up,"Jerry Lewis movies are always a good time and they always take me back to my youth and saturday afternoon and one of his movies were on television thank you, for letting me enjoy them again anytime i can"
4,Love that but disappointed.,"I always loved that movie since I was a little kid. Years ago, we finally got a VHS tape w closed captions. My mom borrowed it so she and her hubby could watch it. Her hubby (my stepdad) had hearing problems due to age. He needed to read closed captions. We laughed alot and my kids who hated classic movies..they loved that movie. My VHS player no longer works. I bought a DVD with NO English subtitle or closed caption. What about hearing impaired ppls who love to laugh w movies? That is why the company won't make English subtitles or CC? I hope another company would make it that so I will buy another one."
2,NON-USA FORMAT,"THIS MOVIE WAS LISTED AS NON-USA FORMAT BY THE SELLER; I DID NOT KNOW MOVIES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES COULD NOT BE PLAYED ON DVD PLAYERS MADE IN THE USA AND IN TALKING TO A WIDE RANGE OF PEOPLE, THEY DIDN'T EITHER. IN CONTACTING THE SELLER THEY ACTED LIKE I WAS STUPID FOR NOT KNOWING THIS, THEY DID FINALLY TAKE THE MOVIE BACK AND REIMBURSE ME BUT I WILL NOT ORDER ANY MORE MOVIES FROM DAA-VEE-DEE BECUASE OF THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD ME."
5,Very good,I have been following taebo for years and it is the more complete training You could find. Cardio + muscle training combined
3,I was hoping for a full body work out. The hour long workout is exclusively upper body and slow moving until you reach the last,"15 minutes or so. I was also a bit disappointed in the following abs sequence that focused on the hip flexors alot. I did like the upper body work, it was varied and not overly complicated. All in all not my favorite work out but would be alright paired with a day you go for a run or bike ride to include some lower body activity."
1,Not What I Expected!,I needed to small night tables due to space. I wasn't expecting a night table for a toddler bed. They need to post the size of the tables I am definitely sending them back.
1,Worried,I am a little worried I ordered 2 of these tables to use as night stands for my husband and myself and now after reading the reviews I am a little worried to actually see what I am getting. I guesss I will just throw it in my yard sale pile if it's not what I want
2,Too Small,I thought the cabinet was big it's tiny. The doors don't even fit together! Thought i was receiving a corner cabinet not a jewelry holder that you sit on top of the dresser!
2,pretty little,"This cabinet seems to be worth more like $5 I knew pretty much what to expect with the size, but it smelt of paint so bad. I am going to keep it because its not totally bad and I think the paint smell will wear off, but I wouldn't recommend it by any means."
2,what a mistake......,"Looks great in the picture, but there were no dimensions given or I couldn't find them. No problem with delivery etc. It will cost me more to return than to store it in the basement yard sale pile."
4,Corner Curio Cabinet is small.........,"I like the cabinet, its cute, but its very tiny. Wow I didn't expect it to be so small. I guess I got carried away by the price,but it is worth the price. I received fast and it was in good condition; no scrathes or anything. Plus no need to assemble it............"
1,This is a fraud,"I bought this from amazon and it turned out to be the worst online purchase ever. it had scratches all over the place and the curio is nothing but a wooden structure painted with god knows what. its not a shiny paint, more like limestone which sticks to your hand. so anyone even thinking of buying this, PLEASE DONT."
1,not worth the bother of returning,"i have one of those modern bathrooms where the architect forgot to put in a medicine cabinet!! Either way I ordered this as a make shift cabinet, it serves it's purpose but it is not pretty or well made. Some parts are not sanded and it looks like i was painted by a five year old (and no it's not part of the antique look). If your desperate for a medicine cabinet go to Target gut out a jewelry box and you'll get better quality and it will be cheaper."
1,Read the Measurements,Pretty cabinet BUT very - and I do mean very small - reminds me of a jewelry box.
2,corner curio cabinet,"I guess it is my fault for not reading the item description completely before purchasing, but this is a very small ""cabinet"". It is very cute and very nice, but not what I was expecting."
2,Poor quality,"I bought this but ended up returning it. I was disappointed with the quality of the finish and materials. Lots of plastic where it should have been chrome or brass. I bought and installed a Delta faucet from Dealyard on Amazon. Same price, much better quality."
3,for the price it was worth it,Don't expect anything fancy but for the price I paid for I think it was worth it. The material is very thin but it's nice.
1,Poor Quality,The flag received is not nylon. It was also sewn crooked. One side was longer than the other. It was so cheap that it was not worth the hassle to go return it.
4,"Not the best quality, but good enough for my needs.","I wanted to find an inexpensive Union Jack for display in my room, so I ordered this one. I got it in a very prompt manner and found it to be a very cheaply made, silk-screened job. I'm not complaining, because it's good enough to display my love of the UK. If you want a flag that you're going to fly outside and you want to last a while, I'd order a more expensive one made with thicker fabric. But, if you just want one to, say, display for a jubilee or some Olympic games or something, this flag will do the trick just fine."
4,Going up in the garage.,"The Union Jack is going up in my garage! Looks great,it will add some panache to my some what drab ""tool cave"". It will go splendidly with my MINI and the old motorcycles."
5,Was A Gift,Bought this for a British coworker of mine to have flown in a combat jet mission. Good material for the price.
1,Very poor quality,"I wasn't sure what to expect because of the low price so remember you get what you pay for. This flag came with irregular stitching on the seams, threads hanging that undo the seams, and the metal gromets fell out. Not worth sending back. I went to a local flag company and bought a real flag."
1,Flimsy,"I purchased this as a Christmas ""stocking stuffer"" for my granddaughter. When it came, I was happy I didn't pay very much for it. It was too cheap-looking to give to her, and not worth sending back. It went in the trash and I bought a more expensive, but good quality cotton flag for her. You get what you pay for."
2,Not impressed,So I bought this item and clearly in the picture there are brass grommets and in the description It said would come with brass grommets but to my surprise when I got it there was no brass grommets made me pretty mad
3,British Flag,"Purchased this flag to fly while a Canadian/British friend visited in Minnesota.....it did its job, however, I would not recommend that it be flown over extended periods of time. It is light weight; 'weak' stitches; and the grommets are not very ""wind ready"" - probably more of an inside flag."
5,Brilliant Union Jack,"These flags are great. I got two and used them as curtains in a bedroom. They are vibrant and show no signs of fading. They are not 100% opaque and let some light through (which is good for our purposes). They were shipped quickly, even with the Holiday rush, and are so very affordable!"
4,Discussion opener,"At long last we found a book that's perfect to use as a guide for the leader of a men's discussion group. At the beginning, this will be used only by the leader with an offer to order individual books later. Many men in our church rejected the book a year ago as too ""sharey"", but with an offer of an opportunity to kick around thoughts and ideas about men's issues, I think they'll go for it."
2,A workbook designed for groups,"I guess I did not pay attention. This is not a chapter book with a few questions at the end, it is a set of 52 short stories with a page and a half of questions.I will use it, just not what I expected."
1,Signposts,"I don't want to review the book, I want to cite Amazon for lying in their advertisement of a ""spiral bound"" book. I received glue bound books that are not easy to use as a workbook. Don't believe them when they say they are selling spiral bound books. THEY ARE LYING!!Of course they already have my payment."
3,Music Machine,"I remember this music from when it originally came out. I liked it then, I like it now - seems to have held up pretty well! This is quite a compilation and worth it to those who like Mitch Ryder & The Detroit Wheels and that ilk. Just good music to bop along to, if nothing else..."
2,Broke down after 18 months,"I bought this camera after reading recommendations on Consumer Reports website. It's a pretty good camera, but perhaps I should have bought something else. Here are the reasons for that: 1) the editing is not easy; 2) colors seem to be washed out, along with the focus; 3) camera broke down after 18 months of use. For the last bullet, it appeared to be some kind of internal electronic malfunction, resulting in complete failure when using camera in moderate sunlight situations (the screen goes white): only when the amount of sun/light is fairly low, will it function. Sony can fix it, but it will cost abuot $250 (I paid $400 for the camera). The other reviews describe problems with this camera in more detail; I just wanted to highlight reliability of the camera."
3,Some what disappointed!,The manual wasn't user friendly. They didn't even include a mini DVD to get started. The camcorder does work great after figuring out most of the options.
2,Don't buy if you want quality video,"This camcorder worked well, but I had two complaints with it.1. On the sound track you can hear noise from the recording head moving back and forth, sounds like a woodpecker. This alone made it unacceptable or what I wanted to do.2. I wanted high quality video, but since it records on a small dvd disk, the video is compressed before it is recorded on the disk. This causes some loss of detail in the picture, especially if you're going to edit it and rerecord the video which I need to do.If you just want a camera to record a small dvd which you can then play in a dvd player (and not all dvd players will play the small dvds) this camera might be acceptable. I returned it and bought a Panasonic PV-GS35miniDV camcorder which uses the miniDV cassette tape. Much better video quality because its not compressd, and no noise from the tape drive."
1,No back-up system,"This camera was easy to use and it was light and had decent quality picture and audio, however, I was unable to make copies for back-up or to share with family members. I took it back and bought a mini-DV camcorder as I was told it was easier to make copies. This has yet to be tested."
1,Careful - not mac-compatible AT ALL!,"Be warned, if you have a computer with a slot dvd drive, you simply cannot transfer your video files to your computer for editing, sharing, whatever. Can't be done without a series of possibly mythical workarounds and loss of quality with each step. I was even willing to consider buying an external dvd drive with a firewire connection and a loading tray that supported the 8 cm disks, but couldn't find one. I searched all over, asked in several places on the apple web boards, talked to the 'geniuses' at the Apple store - this camera is simply not usable with a macintosh that has a slot drive. Talk about crazy!"
4,camcorder,Great picture quality and fast focusing when zooming. Instructions are confusing regarding how to edit and go back to re-record over something.
4,Great affordable camcorder with one disadvantage,"We purchased Sony DCR DVD105 in preparation for our first born. The camcorder had all the features that we wanted and was very affordable. Overall this camcorder offered great value, and we have great videos of our new born. However, if you want your video files to be transferred to a computer for editing or to post it on the Internet, forget about it! This camcorder does not come with USB port to connect directly to your computer. Plus Sony does not provide any software to transfer your video files from the finalized DVD. If you are looking to do some video editing, you might want to consider higher model. Otherwise you will be spending sometime searching for software that will convert the file for you."
5,The Best Camcorder I ever bought,"I just bought this camcorder and find it so easy to use and the best feature for me is the fact that you can view your videos on your dvd player so easily!! I am not interested in dowloading the videos on my computer or editing them as some other reviewers mentioned, so it's perfect for me. I just want to capture my kids in motion and am not looking to create a ""perfect"" movie of my kids. I strongly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great product which is very easy to use."
1,Not reliable: Do not buy it!,"When I saw the recommendation at Consumer Report 1 year and 4 months ago, I was sure that buy this camera would be the right move. Such a mistake...The final result of any film made is very disappointed: the colors came out too washed out.However, the worst part happen recently. I was in my dream vacation in Hawaii last month (August) and the camera simply stop working, suddenly dead, no power, after only 1 year and 4 months of use. Even when I connect the device using the power cord. The DVD-R was trapped inside and I am not even able to take it out.Best Buy Geek Squad confirmed my camera is really dead and tried to charge me US $ 100 just for shipping. Sony told me that, since is out of warranty (1 year), I need to pay US $ 200 + S/H in order to fix it.And we are talking about a US $ 380 value camera here...Bottom line is: do not buy this piece of junk!"
5,Sony DVD Handycam Camcorder review,"This camcorder has the easiest instruction booklet to follow. My husband is very pleased with its size, clarity, ease of use, versatility and high quality pictures and movies. We are very pleased with this purchase."
2,Just ok,"Does everything it says it will do. Came with a remote as well, which didn't work all that well. It drained my batteries very quickly. It moved around a tiny bit no matter how tight I could get it on the body of my D90. It also would disconnect power a little bit for a split second. Which might be the cause of the batteries dying while my camera was in my camera bag. I'd have full batteries, not use my camera for a week. Then they would be half dead or more when I used my camera. Other than that, it worked. I'd buy one again if I didn't have the money for the Nikon version. Just remember to remove batteries while your camera is being stored."
5,Very Satisfied,Just opened it today and it is very sturdy with a nice textured rubber grip. Came 4 days early AND a wireless shutter remote was included. Very satisfied with product and am impressed that such quality can be found for under $20
4,Lighter than I had expected,"The BP-80 by Opteka was a lot lighter than I had expected. The plastic shell adds little weight to the camera, most of my lenses outweigh it. The convinence of using AA is extrememly helpful, especially if you are in locations where it is impossible or impractical to recharge the lithium-ion batteries. The grips on the battery pack work well, I enjoy using the battery pack to do vertical portrait shots. On the downside, the shutter release is somewhat unpredictable, it doesn't have the feel of the camera's shutter release. At times, I've had to push quite hard in order to take a pic, which can cause blur do to small vibrations. Another downside is the battery pack cover keeps opening up. This doesn't cause any problems with the opperation of the camera, but it is still anoying."
1,Not the best,I bought this winter 2007. Needless to say I wanted to save money with this model vs buying the Nikon brand which was about 50 buxs more at the time. I wish I had bought the Nikon version. This one is now having issues with reading 2 batteries at same time and will render the camera inoperative. I have to use only 1 battery at a time to get it to work. Not only that the vertical grip buttons and thumb roller does not work very well. Save ya $$ and get the Nikon version!
2,Is what it is...,"The grip worked great for 9 months - then started having issues with the camera detecting both batteries, and most recently draining batteries left inside of it even when switched to the ""off"" position.On the plus side, still cheaper than a branded grip."
5,Amazing work,"I purchased this doc on the DVD format. It is an amazing, sometimes heartbreaking, always life affirming work. Rather than talking heads, it is a conversation. It's the sharing of a story. It's a response of ""no kidding me too. That's my story too."".I will be buying this again on download. I encourage everyone to buy this documentary. I gave my dvd copy to my therapist to share with all his other patients and coworkers. Because they need to hear these stories.""it's about progress, not perfection."" read one of the lines. And yes mental disease most certainly is about the slow painful progress of getting better, of fighting the good fight, of trying to be healthy, and doing the best you can everytime you can.You see, I am a diagnosed bipolar and in treatment. So this is my story, my struggle, ultimately my success. No kidding, me too!"
5,Inspiration,"Recently I set out online to promote my story about the stigma of mental illness... I came across ""Joey Pants"" facebook group NKM2, then found this movie online. I was blown away by Joe's and all the people involved candor and openness. I love Joe as an actor, which makes it even better to see someone I respect and can identify with, out there too. As I put myself and my illness out there, I now know I'm not alone thanks to this movie and every one's efforts... I know how hard it is to make a film like this and I applaud everyone involved!Feel free to check out my book if you are inclined, it is on Amazon titled Sixty Days to Sanity, A College Freshman's Struggle to Overcome Mental Illness...Pete B.Sixty Days to Sanity, A College Freshman's Struggle to Overcome Mental Illness"
4,NKM2-a teaching aid,I purchased this documentary as material for 2 Social Work classes which I teach at a local university. It is a great contemporary approach to to mental illness. The students were able to relate to some of the participants at a much better level than to dry discussion in a textbook. I plan to use it again next semester.
5,Italian Bronxite,"I first read this book when I was about 12. Now I'm 38. It was great then and is even better now. The movie does not do it any justice.Read the book. The dialogue is real ""street-wise"". And the characters are ""real"". Bronx Urban Legends state that Richie Gennaro is really Richard Price ( take that for what its worth). Also some of the vignettes in the book were supposedly based on actual events."
4,not the movie,"Book was good. Movie was very different. I like both thoughAlthough there are many typos in the book, that was a little confusing sometimes....but still a very enjoyable read...better than The Warriors, at least the read was....."
4,Tales of the South Pacific in the South Bronx,"I really wanted to hate this book---at first. Because at first, much like the very first pages of Catch-22 when we are introduced lovingly to a character we'll never see again, a tall Texan entombed in bandaging, only to meet Yousarian a little later, here you meet Richie Gennaro, High Warlord of the Wanderers street gang. Richie is a dull sort, weak where he should be strong and dumb where he should be smart. As a reader you hope you don't have to spend the whole book with this guy, because then it's going to be a long read. But Price does something surprising and enjoyable. He changes POV's to the other members of the Wanderers, their effed-up families and girlfriends, so that each chapter is like reading Tales of the South Pacific, interconnecting short stories with a scenic sameness to them. There the South Pacific, here the South Bronx. The only real flaw in the book is the over-the-top street fight scenes, which just do not hold up over time."
4,An eye opening surprise,"I have always noticed the difference between books and the movies based on them but wow the changes made from this book into the movie were huge. That being said I really enjoyed the movie and was thrilled to find that it was based on a book. I bought the book on a Saturday and finished it on Sunday. What a great story and much more enjoyable than the movie with its smaller cast. I would say if you are going to read the book then watch the movie don't, watch the movie then read the book, it will be a much better choice"
1,Not what I was expecting,"I saw the movie first and loved it. I couldn't wait to get my hands on the book. I began to read and was very disappointed. Usually I enjoy reading books, but I couldn't even finish this book. The stories jump around randomly and sometimes its hard to get a sense of whats going on. As for the comparison to the movie, way different: characters are switched around, scenes flow in a different order and it lacks the charm that the movie had. Also this book is very explicit sometimes a bit much. I would definitely recommend the movie but not the book."
3,Wandering down under,"I felt this was a good book, but at times difficult to read. The flow of the book was not easy and I felt that some parts of the story where cut short. Still a good read, but I recommend you read the book first then watch the film. As the book is quite different to the film, you may not really appreciate the book if you read it after watching the film."
2,Disturbing to me,"I have read the 5-star reviews of this book, and do not necessarily disagree with their assessments, but for me the reading of this book was like a visit to a disorienting funhouse. There is some stop and lurch to the flow of the novel, which may result from the individual-short-story format of it. More than that, I found the book to be disturbing. Perhaps it's ""realistic,"" but I found the grim depictions of sex, murder, and violence to be too much for me (and more than necessary). I'm not sure why I even finished it, other than that it's a short book and I had already invested the time to start it. This is one of the rare occasions when I'd recommend sticking with the movie version (the movie has more humor and charm than the book does, and it has a great soundtrack)."
3,making history,"The book give a fare look at the printing industry, with many illustrated ex. from the past and the future. The technical side is problamatic due to its complexity, it very hard to make something from the writer experimental way of working with the screen (not allways according to the plan or original sketch.) enjoy."
2,Oster CryogenX Clipper Blade 10 Wide,This blade did not work well for my purpose. I was body clipping a horse and it left ridges of hair in the blade path. I had to stop using this blade and go over the area with a different blade
4,It does the job,"It works as well as I expected. I've used it regularly for many months now.Some ways to make it better: once push the 'carb' button to display how many carbs something has, I should be able to put more stuff on it and have it dynamically update the carbs; instead I have to go back to the weight button, then push 'carb' again. It would be nice to have a nicer interface for picking the food than a chart and a 3 digit code, but I know that might require a full-on computer interface."
3,The Mighty Philadelphians,"The Philadelphia orchestra is one of our greatest orchestra and the playing is awesome, but Ormandy's interpretation is listless and sounds tired. I attribute this to his age. Boring is a fit description.I have not heard the Bartok Manderin but that work was never an Ormandy favorite."
2,FAKE FAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This ring is as FAKE looking as I've ever seen! The ruby is huge. Why can't the manufactures, when replicated colored cubic zirconia stones make them a more realistic color and size!! I would not recommend this ring to anyone!"
5,It's All Here!,"For the Rodgers fan here is everything you could wish for and at an incredible price. I've long had Rodgers on records and tapes and was delighted to find a CD with virtually everything on it to replace them with. To anyone who is just starting out and wants to learn about Rodgers and hear a good sampling of some of his songs with a sound a little more contemporary, I recommend Merle Haggard's ""Same Train - A Different Time."""
1,wonderfull collection,"In stead of ""the best of"" OR ""greatest hits"" Or Anthology, or any of that such money generating titles, this series simply delivers what it says. No chance you miss a song, you just have them all. Maybe they are less ""Digital recovered"" then others. But the sound is still better then the 78 rpm records our grandparents had to work with, and they payed a weeks pay for just 2 songs!!!So purchase this complete collection and also the one of the Carter Family, and no one will ever outsmart you again about the history of country and western..."
5,What I liked about the ideal enterprise,"This funny and often witty book reminded me of one of my favorite books by N. C. Parkinson entitled ""Parkinson's Law"". I enjoyed every minute of Baumann's book and I learned a lot to boot."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this for my classroom thinking it was a board game when it was just a deck of cards with basic information on the United states. The kids liked it at first but then became bored with it, not enough there to keep them involved or to keep playing."
3,Candy surprize,Didn't quite work as indicated on packaging. We had to re-wrap it several times before it worked properly. Needs to be wrapped a bit looser.
5,A little more information about this CD.,"Here are the complete track names for this CD.1. Tenchi Muyo! ~Sonia Mix~ 2. Supersonic Love 3. Electronic Love 4. Zutto dakishimete ite 5. Kuchibiri ni Memory 6. Tenchi Muyo! 7. Modern Girl 8. Love Train 9. Typhoon Girl 10.Heart to Heart 11.SONIA Special Message 12.Tenchi Muyo! ~Television Version~Track 11 is a thank you from Jun and Boogie for buying thier CD, and Track 12 is the Television size of the opening song."
3,Press fit barrel fail,"Writes darker, less faded, than similar BIC stick pens such as the Cristal (not ""Easy Glide"").Much better than Papermate's Eagle pens.Barrel is two-piece press fit together where the grip is, can/will come apart.Don't like the grip. Wish the barrel were wider or hexagonal, or both.That said, this is better than any of BIC's stick pens."
2,Poorly designed writing instruments,"The ink does not flow very well, and even just out of the bag they write like all the ink has dried up. All they do is scratch the paper I'm writing on. Not to mention they are uncomfortable to use because of their design, and because so much pressure is needed to actually apply the ink. Would stay away from this one."
2,RePENt,"These pens went right in the garbage. They do not write well and I have found better deals for better pens. The ink is very dull and the pen itself is not comfortable to hold. These aren't worth buying, not even to get to the $25 free shipping threshold."
1,Not much foundation here to build anything!,"I purchased this book about two years ago thru a catalog. It took 3 months to receive it and was very dissapointed in its contents. The descriptions and instructions are barely there. All this information could have been put in a leaflet. Though the photos are well done they are not enough, neither is the text. Buy Carole Maggio's book and video ""Facercise"". Book is well written and the video is even better. The exercises truly work when done correctly."
2,Incomplete Instructions,"When you try the exercises, you feel that the instructions are incomplete. Exercising certain muscles, especially in the area of the cheeks and mouth, makes you wonder how to keep your teeth (relaxed or otherwise). As a result you may make the wrong moves and defy its purpose.I say this because I am making the comparison with Senta Maria Runge's Face Lifting by Exercise, who does describe in more details what is happening with the various face muscles that you're training."
2,Disappointing,"Beautiful photography in exotic locations but, somehow, sad. If you look at the cover, you've seen it all. The book is filled with aging supermodels in bikini bottoms covering their breasts with their hands or arms. Nothing more."
1,Best for SAHM,"I was sorely disappointed by this book. Many of the ideas require children (read: slave labor) to make the ""job"" worthwhile. If you are single and have been out of work for more than a couple of weeks, most of these ideas are not helpful. Also, most of the ideas are in other books."
4,"I always run out of money before I run out of ""month"".","Not only did this author write chapters on the 75 moneymakers, she went the ""extra mile"" by including more chapters to help people like me. I especially liked the chapters on ""How to Prevent Stress from Stealing Your Time and Energy"" and ""Lay-Off Proofing Your Life"".I've already put into action the moneymaking ideas that interested me. Thank you for renewing my belief that I can be successful in whichever moneymaking ways I select. I'll never again have to worry that my monthly bills are $300+ more than my paycheck."
1,1 decent idea,The book has one decent idea. Everything else you could pay a dollar and get it all off ebay. Nothing really special about book.
5,Excellent,I bought this product from this provider and it arrived on time and works great. I would reommend using this product and provider again. Happy!
1,Dissapointed,"As a longtime Allman Brothers fan, I was anxious to see this video. The video portion was fine, but the audio is horrible. I have several concert DVD's, including The Eagles Hell Freezes Over and James Taylor""s Live at the Beacon Theatre. In comparison, the audio on these two in a surround format is excellent, but the audio here is substandard, hollow and tinny. It may be that the Eagles and James Taylor were recorded on a stage environment, whereas the Allman's used an outdoor format. I hope the Allman Brothers do a stage performance in the future with an emphasis on the audio portion."
3,not the best line up.....,"This dvd is good to own if your a true abb fan, as i am. For someone else to see the band for the first time on this dvd would be disappointing. The band has gone through many changes over the years and this lineup is good, but does not compare to more recent lineups or former ones. These guys on stage just dont have the togetherness that makes this band so great. This dvd does offer some interesting viewing though."
2,"Weakest lineup, get Great Woods VHS instead","I am an ABB fanatic and have been since 1969, Winters End Festival in Orlando. But I have to agree with the other reviewers that the Toler Brothers were a total embarassment and had no business up on the stage with these greats. You can see in this disc how uncomfortable they looked, for good reason. Sorry to have to say this. Get the Great Woods VHS instead, it's a 5+ (but avoid the butchered DVD version of Great Woods). And while you're at it, check out some of their newly available CDs: American University 12/23/70, and their most recent Hittin the Note."
4,Days of Yesteryear...,"What makes this DVD so neat is the first half of it was taped probably 20-25 years ago (judging from the clothes everyone is wearing and the haircuts). Whoever had this original tape did an excellent job preserving it as it is crystal clear and the sound is above average for its' age. My main dissapointment with it is the fact that it lists ""Melissa"" on the cover, yet all you get for that song is about a 2 minute acoustic intro taken from a tv studio tape - no singing and the guys look clearly stoned out of their minds! Still, though, it is a gem if you're an ABB fan (no, I didn't say ABBA). I had the VHS version of ""Great Woods"" and I thought that stunk. This is a much better show."
3,a good show but the band is better than this,i belive the band has better shows to be seen than the two on this vidio. over all it was a decent dvd to watch
1,oh gee its out of print! HINT HINT,"well if its any good then how come its out of print! how hard is it to stamp out more DVD's? not very.well this is bogus, I searched all over for a Allman Bros dvd and not one is good.I did see D Trucks last year, after all the talk, and was almost asleep half way through. talk about no passion.if you wanna make it, you gotta fake it Trucks.I have no doubt most concerts the band members are ""acting"" like they are all into it, hair flying all over the place, etc etc. but still, thats part of the show. or just sell cd's and stay off the stage."
1,Who wrote this???,"I can't believe Bentley Little would actually stake claim to this mindless drivel. This was a COMPLETE waste of time! The few scenes of the Chinese and Indians battling the white man held my attention SOME. If I would rate pages 274 -- 304, it would be a 6 out of 10. The rest ... 0."
3,Great idea...so-so execution.,"Like other reviewers, I also have read most of Mr. Little's books. I would agree that this is not one of his stronger works and I had a hard time finishing it. There are four different parallel stories going on that never interconnect, weakening the overall effect. But for a new twist, he actually has four ""happy"" endings!"" The themes of the story, racism and revenge, are more politically controversial than previous works. I wouldn't pick this as the first work to read if interested in exploring this author. Try The Store or The Association."
2,Slacking?,"The worst Little book I think I've read to date. The book starts out promising, but fades into the realm of absurdity by the three quarter mark. Avoid this stinker and read anything else by the talented Mr. Little."
3,"My first ""Little Book""","This is the first book of Little's that I have read, and from reading the reviews this wasn't his best work. But I think that it is a very interesting read. I was anticpating a better ending, but getting there was the far better read. This did spark enough interest for me to try his other books."
1,why do i keep buying this books?,"Ive been trying to give him chances over and over again, but this book was the last straw. I mean come on it didnt fit at all together its like he just decided to throw as many ideas as possible together that just dont fit. and of course in little style it ends abruptly like he got lazy and decided to quitworst bookdont read!"
3,Everything,"I buy each Little novel as it is released. As a fan I enjoy his writing style even when I do not always like the novel itself. This story has some nice moments, and good tension, but it just didn't do it for me. Though it was fun to see some characters that had appeared in other novels, it just wasn't enough for me to recommend this book. The ending was also a bit weak, which seems to be the standard for a lot of his books. There are so many great books by Little. If you are new, I would start with something like The Store to get a solid Little story."
4,Great little story,"I really enjoyed this book. ""The Burning"" was the first Bentley Little book I've read and I had it finished in a couple of days. I found the story/writing engaging and interresting.My only complaint is that there were characters brought up and then just dropped. At the end of the book I was wondering what happened to the roommate and the friends of the college girl left in Babbitt House. (they were left in a bizzare predicament)."
2,Bookish in India,"The book has nothing to do with Baghdad and is simply a collection of essays that the author wrote over a period of time. While each essay is written skillfuly and with wit, I didn't appreciate that the title made me believe that I will read about the craft of writing inside Iraq. The book should have been titled ""Bookish in India"" instead."
2,Another Christian fad that came and went.,"The power team is still active, but their heyday was in the late 80s/early 90s. Just like the secular heathen world, that the evanglical Christian community views with utter dread, has fads, so does the Christian community. I put this is the same bin as the Living Epistle Message t-shirts. Rmember those with God's Gym, Budwiseup, or something obnoxious like ""God is my football coach"". As for being a positive influence on impressionable youth that could have been wayward, it has my respect. IMO, I just think it was a cheapshot CCM marketing ploy. I bought it out of the cutout bin for literally pennies, gave it a run, and filed away. It's the whos who of Christian commecial rock like Liason, Ken Tamplin, etc."
1,bad dipiction of what you get,Pictures show assembled and painted figures. What a dissapointment to receive what I did. I searched the product again and nowhere does it state assembly and paint required.Hasegawa 1/72 German Infantry Attack GroupI would not hive it a star but I am required.
3,sincere and readable but lacking scientific weight,"I bought this thinking it might have some hardcore science (in a digestible form for the layman) like 'The Hundred-Year Lie' or 'Our Stolen Future'. It is much more lightweight than that - although it is basically a scientific discussion, it does not have any great depth. It discusses depletion of the soil, knock-on effect on human health, and general environmental issues. I liked the tone and sincerity of the authors, and liked it enough to read all the way through, but didn't feel like I learned that much. On a related topic, there's a good and more up-to-date book about what makes healthy soil (and food... and people...) called 'We Want Real Food' by Graham Harvey."
1,Does not work with Windows 7,Be careful when ordering this expensive device! It does not support either 32 or 64 bit Windows 7! I made the mistake of assuming it did and now have a $140 lesson in reading the fine print!
1,Worst purchase ever!,"I ordered these earrings to match a starfish necklace I purchased at JC Penney. They turned out to be garbage when I got them. First, the earrings aren't even the same. They don't match at all. One is bigger than the other and has the sterling silver stamp 925 on it but the other one doesn't. One looks all skinny and the other starfish is fatter. What a terrible purchase. I would have returned them but I figured there'd be issues since they tried to deliver my package and it somehow went astray. I had to call Eve's Addiction to find out what was going on. I will never order from them again."
3,star earring (hold the fish),"Take the title literally. Yes there nice, and decent quality but not what i expected from the picture. The tips of the ""starfish"" don't bend to the side like a starfish looks like, or as pictured. So they look like regular-old star earrings."
4,"Lightweight, Fashionable, and most of all, Cool!","this item is Lightweight. It is not like other purses that hold you down. It is also very Fashionable. The purse matches with almost anything imaginable! If you are going for that island look but you still want to be casual, you could bring this purse. It has a few pockets where you can store just about anything. It's also a very nice gift. The reason it is rated 4 stars is because nothing is perfect. try it out. get it as a gift. this purse also comes it styles of watermelon, lemon, cherry, grape, apple, and pineapple."
2,If you are a culinarian,"Thinking to buy something amazing for a culinarian learning, it's barely a ""high fashionable cooking magazine"" to me.Doesn't worth its money (I mean, not the original price, but the price it is sold for) at all."
4,Perfect Mini Autograph Basketball,I bought this basketball for 1 of my student athletes to sign after she graduated. This basketball was perfect size to display on a bookshelf.
1,Not Elegant cookbook.,"This has to be the worst cookbook ever written. If you love good food, buy it for the amusement factor only. DISGUSTING stuff."
3,Book,"The book was purchased for my son for one of his college courses dealing with Native American literature. I purchased a used book. The cover on the book that arrived had been bent back. Aside from that, the book was in good shape."
5,"Hard as nails, full of heart.",I loved this movie because I came to love the 'hard as nails' but 'full of heart' Sister Helen. This film will shock some more traditional religious people but it is so honest. Those of us who have only a limited understanding of the power of addiction come to respect this totally dedicated woman. Her language and her urgency and determination remind me that saints come in all packages they are not all demure silent types.
1,Weak Product,"Like most cheapo FM transmitters, this one is sub-par, you Can get reception, just one with loads of noise, hisses, turning it useless if you're not semi-deafGiven the chance, I would not buy this product again, Its basically going to the trash bin..."
1,Very Low Quality!!!,I bought the tapes.. and did not like it. The first time I just thought it was those tapes. So I bought them a second time and again they were terrible. They have very bad sound. It is not just the sound but the picture was also bad. I really think these tapes are pure JUNK. I do not reccomend these tapes to anybody! They are the worst tapes I have used in my camcorder. I have also used the sony and I highly reccomend them to you.
1,Very Rough Material,The material of this rack feels a lot rougher than I expected. The magazines get caught on the sides and bunches up. I am really disappointed at the quality of this rack.
5,Sturdy and Attractive Clutter Catcher,"This magazine rack is sturdy and attractive and holds up well over time. I have owned this item for around seven months and have had no problems so far. It does what it is supposed to do (holds magazines and books next to the sofa)and it looks nice. In a perfect world I wouldn't have any ""clutter,"" but this does a good job of corralling and concealing the magazines and books that I am currently perusing, as well as a few game controllers. I would purchase this item again. In fact, I am thinking about getting another one for my bedside."
4,Just what I needed,This was just what I needed as an organizer by my chair. It is sturdy and it looks nice. Thanks again.
2,Strange shape,"I didn't realise when I bought this that it has a very deep trough just by the rim. Strange shape, presumably for some particular type of tart, but not much good for general use."
1,Does not work with Nokia E51,"Whichever Nokia this products does work with, it does NOT function with a Nokia E51. It would cost more in postage to return it to the USA than it cost. It would be helpful if they would spell out more clearly that it does not work with all nokia phones which do take a 2.5mm plug.If inserted in the Nokia E51, it generates the message, ""Enhancement not supported"".Suggest you check carefully beforehand whether it will work with your particular Nokia.The picture does not represent what was sent."
1,Does not work well with E62,"I bought this item hoping to be able to use a standard Plantronics headset, but the volume is so low as to make it unusable.I also tried a Sony mono headset, a standard earbud headset, and a cheap 4 conductor headset. The latter did not work at all, and the other two also had such low volume as to be unusual. Very disappointing."
2,Bait and Switch,"This is the first time I've been disappointed by a ""Dawn"" dvd. I gave it 2 stars only because part of the Hawaii segment was a ""Coastal Dawn"". The actual dvd is largely fuilled with landscape, pretty landscape to be honest, but not what is advertised. The second HALF is the Maine woods, trees, mountains even cemeteries. The Maine coast is shown at times off in the distance. The entire dvd is a technically sound product but far from what is advertised. I recommend that if you want coastal sun rises you avoid this dvd and purchase one of the Sunrise Earth products under the Discovery Channel label!!"
2,"Pretty boring, not like sunrise earth",I understand that these are not supposed to be action packed however this disc takes it to the next level. I was looking for something similar to sunrise earth to watch while listening to music on the exercise bike and I think I've watched this twice.
2,Disappointed...,"I was disappointed with the locations and production quality on this DVD - especially for the hefty price. I also found it quite boring. The other reviews build it up quite a bit and although the footage does look nice, it is definitely NOT any better than any of the BBC documentaries like Planet Earth or Ganges. I bought this to show off the capabilities of my new Plasma Kuro, but I think the BBC documentaries are far superior in terms of production, cinematography and quality."
4,"If you have to have it, you gotta have this","I wish I had a laser fax machine, alas, not. The price of new rolls of print film is astronomical. These are wonderful and not nearly as expensive."
4,Fax film works fine,This is fax film I got for my Sharp UX-510. It works fine and seems to last a good while. It is the only type film that will fit my machine so I hunt around for the best price.
2,Beware,"If you drive a race car you may want these. If you drive a truck, they lasted around 15,000 miles on my truck. IN THE REAR???? My other pads lasted 60,000. at less than half the price and they are rear brakes so there is no ""considerable difference"". Performance yes, I guess. Practicality... uh, NO."
4,Lawyers spend their professional careers shoveling smoke,"Shoveling Smoke is about Clay Parker, a burned out Houston lawyer who moves to a small town/small firm to practice a bit of everything. He doesn't anticipate that his small town life would include a crazed alcoholic partner or that his small town cases would involve murder and insurance fraud. Every single character is lively and well thought out, and it is packed with lots of Texas-isms. You have to love Austin Davis, you can tell he is a good 'ole Texas boy. The book had me laughing out loud. I look forward to reading more, hopefully it will be another Clay Parker book."
2,"easy to use, but not great","I like the format of this dictionary. It's easy to find words you're looking for, and the tips are great.Yes, it's limited and I can't find a lot of words, but I expect that from a beginner's dictionary. My problem is that the dictionary uses the Beijing pronunciation. They should at least have the regular pronunciation and then the Beijing one. Not everyone wants to acquire a Beijing accent (ew!!!). For example, instead of ""yídi'n"" (a little, '''they have it as ""yídi'nr"" (''''. Many other examples. Even some of my Mainland Chinese friends were appalled.There's no warning on the backcover and no explanation in the introduction, which I think is irresponsible on the editors' part."
2,"OK, but lots of words are not listed","The term ""Beginner's"" is certainly accurate; however, even beginners need to have a bit more words in a dictionary than this one has. If I could do this over, I would simply buy a complete dictionary. Fortunately, there are plenty of apps available for Android smartphones that can help you fill in the blanks (and there are a lot of them). Go with a full dictionary and save yourself some time and frustration."
3,"Useful, but may as well get an entire dictionary","I find that the features that supposedly make this a beginner's dictionary are superficial. To start, the examples are no clearer than those you get in the complete Oxford Chinese Dictionary. The grammar notes are sparse throughout the dictionary, so I don't feel that it benefited me as much as I was hoping. Then the ""center of each dictionary is a section devoted to useful information on the country, countries, or regions where the language is spoken"" has less information on these topics than the complete Oxford Chinese Dictionary.It's not that this wouldn't be useful, I just feel that you may as well get a complete dictionary. There's not enough instruction in this beginner's version to learn out of it on your own, and I feel that a complete dictionary would complement your class textbook just as well as this beginner's version."
2,"Okay, but not great",".Oxford Beginner's Chinese Dictionary is a competent, well marketed mainstream product. Its shortcomings would not be so noticeable were it not for DeFrancis' ABC English-Chinese, Chinese-English Dictionary - which is a great dictionary. (See ""Indispensable tool for students and scholars"" review atABC English-Chinese, Chinese-English Dictionary (ABC Chinese Dictionary Series).)"
5,Oxford Chinese Dictionary,"I bought this book because I recently began learning Mandarin. It is a great addition to the personal tutoring and Rosetta Stone software that I am using. I really love the way it is designed. It is easy to use and really helps you understand how to pronounce the words correctly, as well as understanding how to read Chinese characters. I love it and I strongly encourage anyone who has an interest in learning Chinese to buy it."
4,An easy to use dictionary,"This is an easy to use dictionary and i mostly recommend it for a beginner. If you're very advanced, you may not like it if you're looking for the more uncommon words but otherwise this is a pretty good dictionary. It had most of the words you'd need. I am a beginner at chinese myself and i thought it was adequate. It works and it even teaches you some basic knowledge. Overall this is a good buy but i don't recommend the smaller pocket version since it has less words. This book is pretty small and is the size of an adult hand so it is pretty pocket size."
5,Learning Chinese,"This is by far the best Chinese/English book on the market, according to my Chinese daughter-in-law. I agree. It has one section on Chinese to English, one section on English to Chinese (words, not symbols), one on ""survival"" sentences. Also an explanation of pronouns, nouns, adjectives, etc."
2,not for beginners,print is too small for one thing.Definitions do not give any clue how to pronounce words.
1,Not Good for a Serious Learner,"I give private Chinese lessons and recommended this dictionary to a beginner student. Unfortunately he grew out of this dictionary in three months. He often encounters characters that are not included in this dictionary. If you are serious about learning Chinese, don't buy this beginner's dictionary."
3,Works well but doesn't hold up,"These sponges work wonderfully, cleaning marks I thought I could never get off the walls. However, they only last about 10 minutes apiece (I used the ""original"" version vs. the heavy duty), and they break apart into very small sponge fragments. This is a problem, since I have a toddler who still puts things in his mouth. This would also be a problem for people with pets."
4,Be Very Careful!,"The Magic Eraser should be reserved for scuffs and grease that nothing else will remove. The eraser leaves dull spots on semi-gloss painted surfaces, and walls painted with flat latex have slight sheen where I used the eraser. Maybe I used too much pressure. Use this very sparingly on painted surfaces. It works really well, however, on sticky, greasy kitchen appliance surfaces, and textured plastic surfaces."
4,Works where nothing else will,"True, it does get used up pretty fast and winds up being a little expensive, but on some stains/soils it really does seem like magic. I tried just about every wonderful, fabulous, extra strength, use only in adequate ventilation, wear gloves, chemical available in the store and nothing would remove stains in my bath tub. Magic Eraser does. Hallelujah!"
4,This is a rare piece of negroe league and black history......,"Although this film is too short, that does not deminish it's importance nor its brilliance. This film is clearly the forerunner to the succeeding film, 'THERE WAS ALWAYS SUN SHINNING SOMEPLACE."", because many of the same players were interviewed for both films. I would venture to guess that the budget was too small to allow a longer film to have been made. This film is truly a fine historical document...."
5,Action Sim at it's BEST!,"Jump into a state-of-the-art warbird and hit the ground gunning in a furnace of incendiary action. Taste the action from all sides in U.S., British, German and Russian Gunships. Experience total immersion at the front line in one of today's most advanced weapons platforms. Definitely get the feel of flying a Chopper into battle! Your gonna love this one! Buy it complete with all the bells and whistles and STRAP YOURSELF IN!!!!!!!"
4,Good and clear,"For this price it's ok. A fast and easy way, a 1st step into german language. Good for beginners. No extra teaching needed."
3,Tracks,"Tracks1. Keep On Pushing Our Love (7"" version)2. Keep On Pushing Our Love (T-Empo Club mix)3. Keep On Pushing Our Love (Reverand Jefferson's Naughty mix)4. Keep On Pushing Our Love (T-Empo dub mix)5. Keep On Pushing Our Love (Reverand Jefferson's Missionary Dub)"
3,A bit too bulky and wide,"The quality is great but I would recommend you handle one first and see how it fits your hand. It's a bit too wide for me to use comfortably. Otherwise, it has a lot of tools packed into one."
1,Don't get in a lather,"This is billed as ""The Big Chill for Gen X"" but it's more like the big sleep. A total bore. I couldn't get interested in the story of any of the characters. They were too boring even to be annoying."
2,"Reunion flick, but this one won't be a classic...","The Lather Effect starts off with the camera panning throughout a house following a reunion party of less than a dozen folk.Unfortunately, if those people consumed all the alcohol bottles shown, they'd all be in the hospital with acute alcohol poisoning.And that was the start.The Lather Effect refers to the instructions on many bottles of shampoo: use, rinse, repeat. That second lather is even frothier than the first. So... expect that party following a party to be richer and wilder.In other words, people with hangovers are worse at keeping their feelings and secrets to themselves than those who are simply drunk.New people connect, old flames are new flames, and current flames are renewed or extinguished.Well, that about wraps up the film. I know there will be comparisons with The Big Chill but, believe me, this one is in a different league. And it's not the majors."
3,This film can stand on its' own,"The question is not if a film is as good as or better than another one. The question is not if we could be watching a better film. In almost every case, I assume the answer would be YES but we might have less than twenty films to watch. I feel the question should be ""Is this an enjoyable film?"" I find the answer for this film is ""Yes"". The actors are all good solid talents in believable roles. The situations are plausible and some of the lines are good. You will smile, laugh and maybe get nostalgic. Is this a great film? No but how many great films are their?"
2,This violates the rules against torture!,"It would be hard to imagine a movie more boring than this one. Basically, a bunch of young adults go to a high school reunion party and decide to extend the party for the duration of the movie. It is a continuous, childish, converstional drone. The acting is fine, so I don't blame the actors. It is just a completely unimaginative story. If you can't get enough of this, there are plenty of extra features to prolong the agony."
5,One of the sharpest comedies around,"This is a brilliant little film. Eric Stolz gives a blinding performance as the lead in what has been called a 'Big Chill' for 80's kids. It's the morning after a massive party, and the group of friends cleans house, revisting the previous night. It's pretty compelling if you're in your 20s-40s and wondering if you wound up with the right person, if life is set. The film manages to be bittersweet yet unpretentious and the script by Sarah Kelly and Tim Talbott is utterly hilarious. Wish there was a higher than five star rating."
2,Dull,"It's not often I have trouble finishing a movie, but this one just did not interest me at all. I thought I'd like it because the cast contains many actors I like (Connie Britton, Eric Stoltz, Tate Donovan). And they were okay, but there's not much they can do with a boring story.Not recommended."
2,Not Even Entertaining,I kept waiting for the story to pull together. For the characters to be people I care about. For some type of cinematic continuity that would bring me entertainment. I didn't get any of these. It seems like the writers started off with a good idea and just couldn't put it together. Does this bring you flash backs form the 80's? No. Is there reasonable acting No.
4,Come as you were... the morning after,"If you're a child of the 80s, and ever waxed nostalgic for Risky Business, remember when Madonna was edgy and fresh, and would see anything by John Hughes, this is a must see. You can't go back, but you can reminisce. The premise is a ""come as you were"" party celebrating 80s pop culture, and music, but it's really about those of us in the post-baby boomer, not really Gen X generation and the lives we've led. Enjoyable performances and chock full of 80s references. I saw it SXSW, wanted to see it theatres again, but at least it's now in my DVD collection."
2,Disappointing. But the music's great.,"I was really looking forward to this movie, billed as a ""Big Chill"" for those who went to high school in the 80's. I did attend high school in the 80's, but found that the only part of this movie I could really relate to is the music.The movie opens the day after a monster ""Come as You Were"" party that, from the detritus, reminded me of the house parties that were the staples of 80's coming-of-age flicks. Unfortunately, I think I would rather have seen the party itself than the aftermath. I couldn't really relate to any of these people who seem to want to go back to high school instead of returning to their lives after their reunion. The actors' performances were great, but the story was dull, dull, dull.The music was great, even though most of the songs were just background fragments, lasting five seconds. The music, not the characters and their endless conversation, made me feel nostalgic."
2,Light and frothy with as much substance and entertainment value,"""The Latter Effect"" starts off promising enough and has a very good cast. The film though quickly falls apart due to cliched writing and direction. The soundtrack is impressive with a nice array of 80's hits. While they are well used they are used to cover up the lack of comedy/drama rather than enhance it.Valinda (Connie Britton) brings together a group of friends played by Ione Skye, Eric Stoltz, David Herman, Sarah Clarke, Peter Facinelli, Tate Donovan and Caitlin Keats to an 80's party designed to help her relieve the tension in her life. The results should be a mixture of comedy and pathos at missed opportunities much like ""The Big Chill"" but its as if ""The Big Chill"" were directed by John Hughes never escaping the teenage angst that was a hallmark of his films.The film has good intentions but good intentions don't make a great film. Rent it if you must see it."
1,Low quality reprint,"This review refers to the paperback edition.I quote from the first page of the book.""First we scanned the original rare book using a robot etc."".What this means is a reprint of low quality. The book contains many typos.All german fonts are badly rendered.It is practically unreadable.After this book was delivered I saw it was useless.I had to go to Amazon uk site and order the british editionof same title. The british edition was OK."
3,a catchy cut,I only like a few of His songs but this one always caught my ear.this one has the Neptunes Production on it&combined with his Vocals make for a cool going to the club type of cut.
3,"Good moisturizer, but reactive to sensitive skin","I tried this moisturizer for a few weeks. However, the product caused my sensitive skin to react, and I was forced to stop using the product and return it.As an alternative for those with sensitive skin, I would recommend Art of Shaving Eye Gel, which I have used for some time with no adverse reaction.This product moisturized well, but irritated sensitive skin."
2,Not for those who aren't fans,"I'm still bending over backwards to be fair about this book. There's nothing wrong with writing a novel about Mortal Kombat, except this one is just a re-hash of the movie with no variation, panache, or even interest. The author writes the book as if it were a chore. Like the movie, it displays a very contrived plot and undeveloped characters. If you're an easily pleased Mortal Kombat fan, you might like it, but there are no garantees."
2,Just another collection of Medium difficulty puzzles...,"I see nothing 'Mensa' about this book. It's a just a big collection of medium-level puzzles. All the puzzles can be solved by inspection only (without any pencil markings or using advanced techniques), and I mean ALL of them!Very similar to Rios's other book 'Black Belt Sudoku'.If you want tough challenging puzzles, I highly recommend you look else where..."
1,This is mensa quality?,"Sorry, but I didn't find these puzzles a bit challenging. I DO like the fact that the puzzles are supposedly in consecutive order of difficulty as you advance through the book. That's a nice feature. Because of it, I immediately began skipping ahead and never did find a puzzle that was challenging."
1,Mensa for Dummies?,"Maybe change the title to ""Mensa for Dummies?""A total waste of money for anyone looking for any sort of challenge."
1,Get Sudoku for Dummies instead -- it's more challenging,"This book was a huge disappointment for someone who wanted to be challenged. I got Sudoku for Dummies around the same time, and discovered that all of the Mensa puzzles were easier than many of the Easy puzzles in the Dummies book. All of the Mensa puzzles can be solved by rote without any complex thought. If you want challenging, try the Tricky, Tough, or Diabolical puzzles in the Dummies book, or the variants like 16x16."
1,I'm not a member of Mensa but these puzzles are way too easy!,I agree with the majority of the reviews that these puzzles are way too easy. The only challenge I have now is to complete them in under 10 minutes.
2,Far too easy,"I'm looking for a book full of '4' and '5' Sudoku, and I figured that a book with Mensa's name on it would give me that. I think these are all '2' difficulty. I zip right through them with no trouble at all. Very curious that Mensa would put their name on it. At least call it the Mensa Book of 500 Medium-Level Sudoku puzzles.I am giving this two stars, even though I sort of feel ripped off, because the physical quality of the paper, binding, and print is good."
1,MENSA NOT,Sudoku puzzles are usually rated 1 to 5. These puzzles are 1 to 2. The last 50 of 534 puzzles might be level 3.I'd rate zero stars if I could. MENSA should be embarrassed that they endorsed this book.Should rename 'Easy Sudoku'.
1,"Not challenging, uniformly easy puzzles","I bought this book thinking it would be somewhat challenging and because (as another reviewer has mentioned) there were 500+ puzzles for < $10. Unfortunately he puzzles start out easy and do not increase in difficulty. I don't belong to Mensa and I don't consider myself a Sudoku master, but I've worked more interesting Sudoku puzzles in the newspaper."
2,Not challenging at all,"The title is misleading; this is really an elementary sudoku puzzle book with very little change in the degree of difficulty between the beginning and the end. However, this is a very good book for a beginner who is addicted but not yet an intermediate puzzler.I found the martial arts sudoku series much better for true sudoku (and kakuro) connoisseurs."
1,Sudoku for laughs,"This book is a joke. I agree with other disparaging remarks previously made about this book.It was purchased as a gift for me by someone who had no experience with Sudoku puzzles and only because it had ""Mensa"" in the title. I've contacted Mensa and Sterling Publishing Co strongly objecting to misleading the public with the title. I have insisted that Sterling management be made aware of my dissatisfaction with the book and directed them to this page to the previous criticisms. Hopefully no one else who reads this review will purchase ""Mensa(?) Sudoku"" or any other books of Michael Rios. I also intend to return the book to the seller even though it has a few puzzles (first and last three) completed."
1,"Oh, Please!","No new information here. I'm just adding my voice to the chorus of negative reviews in hopes of pushing the ""average review"" rating farther downscale. If this book is in any way representative of Mensa, I must say that it simply confirms rumors I've heard that Mensa membership constitutes certified idiocy.Tic-tac-toe is more challenging than the puzzles in this book."
1,Very Easy Sudokus,"Don't waste your time or money on this book if you are looking for challenging sudokus. Even the puzzles at the end are quite easy. You can solve even the ""hardest"" of them with using only a few pencil marks."
1,Sudoku for Kids,"Yeah, Sudoku for Kids should be the title of this book. I've tried puzzles from the front, the middle, and the back of the book. Yea, they progressively get harder, going from about 30 numbers given to 24 numbers given, but they're all easy. I can't believe Mensa allowed the author to use their name for something like this. This book should've been marketed to children not people looking for difficult Sudoku. Just out of principle, I don't think you should buy any of Michael Rios' books if he's willing to screw people over like this."
2,Too easy,I was lured by the title. Unfortunately the puzzles are too easy. Have I been fooled all this time thinking MENSA members possessed superior intellects to mine.
4,Its good,"It worked surprisingly, but I ended up in trouble and almost was fired by my boss for putting this in his morning coffee sugar jar."
5,Good Buy!,"Great music to relax to, as the album title says, or to play in the background while you read a good book."
4,voigtlander 35mm,"i bought this lens for my leica and it is actually an updated version which uses the leica m mount. when i first got it, i couldnt get over how compact it was! the build quality is decent, but it feels downgraded compared to my zeiss 50mm f2 planar. the aperture ring is loose and is easily knocked out of place. the focusing ring feels plasticy, but overall focusing is smooth. i cant gripe too much because the leica and zeiss equivalents to this lens are several times more expensive. overall this lens is pretty decent. wide open, its a little soft, vignettes, and ive noticed some color fringing. for black and white, it does give it that ""classic"" look. stopped down, this lens performs well and produces sharp images."
5,The Perfect DVD player [for the money],"To start, this DVD player seems a mystery to me. It has all the features (besides Progressive Scan) that [many of the more expensive] DVD players have. It has MP3 playback, VCD, HDCD, DVD, you know the rest, yet it is sooo CHEAP! And it comes with all the cables. It comes with batteries. Its instruction book is so easy to understand. It doesnt overheat DVDs. It doesnt skip. It is amazing! So why the [modest] price tag (IT seems so cheap)! Well simply, because it is a no name brand that doesnt need to advertise or put their DVD player on magazine covers with silver special effects. It is possibly the best DVD player you can buy. It works excellent. It is great, and soo cheap. Everyone who doesnt want to spend a lot on a REALLY TOP OF THE LINE dvd player, with progressive scan and the works, GET THIS ONE. It is soooo great and I am very happy with it."
3,Apex DVD Player - Entry Level Unit,"I own an Apex unit, and while it serves it's purpose, it is lacking in a few departments. It has a zoom function, which works well enough, and an internal volume control which is also handy.A few issues though: The RCA audio output level is relativly low, meaning you need to crank your receiver up pretty high. There is also a small glitch with the subtitles; after using the pause/rewind/fast-forward functions, the subtitles automatically turn on. (A minor glitch, but can be a real pain.)The unit will play MP3s, but only if they were burned on a recordable MUSIC CDRom, NOT a data CDRom.It's a great entry level unit, if you're not looking for a pro-level consumer unit."
4,out of stock,It is very upsetting to find out after a few days that your credit card will be refunded with the next billing cycle. I hope it isn't happening to lot of people and that's the company's( whynotpayless or similar) way of getting to money.
3,APEX DVD-Player,"First of all I wanted to say that I am researching also on DVD-players with PAL function. And I am also not sure if this one would play on my NTSC TV, since I read that most of the time one needs to have a PAL compatible TV in order to view PAL DVD's. I am from Europe but have been living in the US for a while and would like to enjoy DVD's from home too. That's the main reason why I would like to buy this DVD Player. If anyone has experience as to how the playback for Region 2 works, I would appreciate a comment."
3,I just ordered one,I compared 6 DVD players (...) The Apex had more features then most (including the...sony) and is compatable with the most CD formats. I am buying this as a gift for two young kids....Ill let you know how it holds up.
1,"To ""An Electronics Fan"" and others shopping 'cheap'","I couldn't let this slide. In your review, you comment, ""I would recomend it to anyone who is living on a budget, but needs a DVD player."" I would contend that nobody NEEDS a DVD player, especially someone on a budget. It's great to be frugal, but that means getting value in return for the money spent. Based upon other reviews, it appears that the money saved compared to other models in the price range is not worth it. That's probably why a local grocery warehouse store is selling this same model."
1,What a waste of money!,"I bought two of these. On one toilet, it left a weird film in the bowl, and then one of the tubes let loose and poured water all over the floor. Even when I put the tube back, it would not stay on. On the other one, the cap leaked and sprayed water all over the top of the tank, which subsequently dripped onto the floor. Great return policy, too (for them, not for the customer). The product has to be returned (ewww! pack up and mail something out of my toilet?) with the receipt within 15 days (except that the product doesn't fail right away)."
3,It does clean.... but it does leak!,"I'm on the fence here with this product. One on hand it does a great job keeping the toilet bowl clean. On the other hand, it definitely leaks. Not right away but usually after you have to replace the refill.Two places that it leaks:- The cap. There is a black rubber gasket and you need to make sure that it provides a proper seal with you screw the cap on the unit- Next to the intake port. Right next to the intake where you hook up the feeder hose there is (what looks like) a pressure relief mechanism with a black piece of rubber. If that rubber doesn't rise to the top of the cylinder -- then water is going to shoot out the top. Not a lot of water more like a spray.So, I think they need to work on this a little more. Great idea but they need to come up with a design that isn't so prone to leaking."
1,Kaboom Stinks! .... Literally!,"**Please keep in mind this is a review of the product ONLY and not the seller. Thanks.My husband bought this product and we tried it, however it doesn't clean like it advertises it does, I wasn't looking to not clean my toilet for three months, that's unrealistic, but I was looking to stop cleaning every three days. This didn't help me with that at all. They are expensive for the lack of cleaning power and to top it all off, they have a rancid sewer smell, I couldn't figure out why my bathroom stunk, I cleaned, bleached, sprayed all to no avail, then my mom mentioned that she tried this product and it made her bathroom stink! So I promptly removed mine, and viola! No more stinky bathroom! I would not recommend this at all, I continue to buy old faithful, the clorox drop in's."
2,smelly,I just got this product. It seems to work well but the smell is like a sewer I have an air freshener & it doesn't block the smell not sure if I can keep using it. Also I have a low flo toilet & can't figure out how to hook it up in that toilet.
5,"Try Kaboom NeverScrub for ""FREE""","I just got this product plus a free extra refill two weeks ago through a ""FREE"" offer (+$5 shipping). The offer is through the manufacturer, Church & Dwight via the neverscrubclub. You can easily Google it. It installed in less than a minute. The first night, the chlorine smell was so strong, you could smell it from the bedroom even with the bathroom door closed. The strong smell went away after a day. Now you can only smell it in the bathroom, a reassurance that it is doing its job. I have read that refills are available from WalMart in the hardware section, not in the cleaner section. When it's time to change it I will see if it can be reloaded with dry bleach or pool tablets. I read that chlorine attacks rubber so that is probably why the in-the-tank products caused the need for constant replacement of the flapper valve and why the gasket in the NeverScrub reservoir leaks. Silicone would be much better. Maybe one can be found at the hardware store."
4,"No cap, and no leaks","Very odd all these reveiws about water all over the floor. My sister bought the new improved version and gave me her origianl one. Somehow I managed to lose the cap, though I didn't know it, but I have never had a drop of water on the floor. It also seems to be working just fine, toilet is keeping clean, about 3 weeks now. Though i suspect the lack of it is affecting its longrange cleaning abilityGiven that I never had that cap, I will just get the new improved one, as I think the lack of a cap is affecting its filtering some, water is pouring out of the unit, just not on the floor. I cannot even imagine how water would go on the floor, but obvioulsy it has for many people when the cap came off. Beats me!Very puzzling!"
2,Buy the newer design,"I've been using this product for over a year. I have to say it does a fantastic job of keeping your toilet bowl clean without forcing you to replace the flapper in the tank every few months because the other in-tank solutions destroy it.But, this is the original design. It's impossible to keep from leaking. The O-ring doesn't fit correctly; I added a rubber band to help seal it but even that didn't totally fix the leaking problem.Why is leaking bad? Two reasons. First, if it comes out fast enough it will, and has, shot right out of the tank (past the lid) and onto the floor. Second, it fills the tank faster than it fills the bowl so you don't have as much water in the bowl.I recently replaced this design with the newer one (#35113). They totally redesigned it and it works great. Cleans your toilet and it doesn't leak. Make sure you buy the new one, not this one."
4,Qi Gong to cleanse or not to cleanse,There are many ways to do a body cleanse and I find that when I use Qi Gong along with Tai Chi I get maximum results.
4,Exclusive Live Tracks From the Archives,A period piece that shows the intersection of very vital music at a special time. Diverse but with unifying elements. Some of the avant artists here actually make more of a squall than the punks.One complaint might be that almost anyone interested in this would feel at least half this material definitely deserves full-length treatment. What's here is just a taste.Sonic Youth - World Looks RedSonic Youth - Shaking HellSwans - Clay ManSwans - WeaklingBill's Friends - RTZArthur Russell - Hiding Your Present From YouArthur Russell - All-Boy All-GirlChristian Marclay - His Master's Voice (opening)Rhys Chatham - Guitar TrioElliott Sharp - Crowds and Power
3,Not Newbery Honor material...according to my students :P,"This book has been given the honor of being a ""Newbery Honor medal"" award winner, but many of my students disagree. Although they liked most of the book, they felt that the writing was less than stellar and that other books such as Garth Nix's ""Abhorsen"", Jeanne DuPrau's ""The City of Ember"" or Stephen E. Ambrose's ""This vast land"" would have been better choices (this is coming from my Jr. High kiddies...). I would not put this book in an Elementary school library as it has too much profanity and sexual suggestions. This is a shame as...aren't Newbery winners supposed to be targeted for elementary and middle school students? Where's the wholesomeness? Where are the vocabulary, story and plots of Newbery winners of long ago? Not to be found in this book...a dismal disappointment..."
5,Ocean of Olive,"I thought this book was a great all0around book. At times, it was filled with raw emotions while other times it got me on the edge of my seat. This book is great for people of all ages, filled with mixed emotions. I would recommend this book to anyone who was looking for a good book to read. I think this was a wonderful book because people of all ages could relate to this book. It's a book that records the ups and downs of a regular twelve-year-old girl, Martha Boyle, and her summer at her beloved grandmother's house. This book was a quick easy read and was one of those books where you just couldn't put it down, you had to keep on reading."
3,Olive's Ocean,"This book is about a 12 year-old girl named Martha who was nice to a girl named Olive but never said much to her. Olive gets hit by a car and dies before Martha goes to the ocean. Olive had never been to the ocean and Martha feels guilty about the fact that Olive wanted to be friends with Martha. This book was sad and romantic, but I think it needed a happier ending. I read it in one night because it was so intresting!"
2,No Plot,"I had heard a lot about this book from kids in my grade, (seventh grade). Most of them liked it a lot so I read it. I read it in about an hour and then it was just over. It doesn't really have a plot. There's no middle, or end. It justs starts and you're waiting for something and then it's over. You know how with some books, at the end you put it down and you say, ""Wow, that was a great book."", well with this book when it's over you say, ""I guess that was kind of cool."""
3,It is just so...serious,"The premise of the story is very thoughtful. Kids do have to deal the death of a classmate sometimes. Martha's relationship with her grandmother is very special and Henkes writes very lovingly of their affection for each other. There are lots of intermediate and jr. high readers who love ""growing-up-angst"" stories. I think girls 4th grade and up would identify with Martha. It definitely has a place in an elementary library though it is important to remember the medal on the cover does not mean it is a match for all readers nor all age groups . Younger readers would not appreciate the issues Martha faces. The ""language"" referred to in other reviews is very mild.Henkes's novels are very different in tone from his picture books."
2,Olive's Ocean review by Miss Derick :),"Olive Barstow and Martha Boyle were classmates, olive was quite, shy and didnt have friends. Martha was a creative writer, she had a older brother, and a younger sister. When olive gets hit by a car and dies, martha cant do anything without thinking of her because olives mother brought martha a journal entry about how olive wanted to be friends with , and wanted to see the ocean, and be a writer. This book was really slow, and to me was hard to stay on track."
1,TERRIBLE BOOK,"I thought this was a really aweful book. I thought that the emotions she was feeling about the other characters in the book were very unrealistic. Secondly, Kevin Henkes does a TERRIBLE idea of what a twelve year old's writing would be like. Martha's writing is AWEFUL! This book just didn't make sence. I didn't get why she ""felt her life was changing before her eyes"" just because her father was mad, her brother went out, and her little sister was crying. I didn't care for the characters at all. Martha had no personality.This was an all around bad book"
5,Perfect Read Aloud Book,"Over the holidays, my 9 year old niece and I read out loud about 5 - 7 chapters a night. The structure of the chapters was conducive to our switching who read out loud. I read the 3 page chapters and she read the 1 - 2 page chapters. The story moved along so that each day we had new events to discuss while drying the dishes. It was a great experience for me. I enjoyed the story and most of all enjoyed my special activity with my niece. My niece also got a thrill at having completed her first BIG book. I highly recommend this book for a read out loud bedtime story."
2,Really? For 12-year-olds and younger?,"I'm a mom, and this book was on a recommended reading list at school.Maybe it's just me. This book is packed with mopey life-and-death musings, I-hate-my-family tantrums (including from the DAD!), sarcastic language, and four-letter words. The writing is pretty, the relationship with the grandmother is very special, and the characterization of Martha is complete, but... this is not an enjoyable book.Is twelve too young for a first kiss?Amazon won't let me post the bad language -- I may put it in the comments."
5,PCE Student Review,My favorite book would have to be Olive's Ocean. The author is Kevin Henkes. The genre he chose was realistic fiction and the theme he chose was a girl learning to grow up. My favorite character is Martha Boyle. Martha Boyle is a girl that always thinks about a little girl named Olive that died because a truck hit her. Somehow she learns that Olive wanted to friends with her.Mr.Henkes writing style is to express because he is trying to make you laugh and cry. I would want to pick up another one of his books because of the words he chooses it makes you feel like your really there looking at Martha or walking in her bedroom. I love this book because it's a roller coaster of emotions it makes you want to laugh cry and jump in the book and slap someone. Olive's Ocean is a very sad book because Martha has to cope with Olive death.
4,olives ocean,I would highly recomend this book to some one who is about thirteen threw fifteen. This story has good morals and deals with real life issues. one of the main issues begun at the begining of the book when a mother of a girl named olive who has just died comes to the front door of the main charecter martha.another issue rises when martha goes to visit her grandma at her house on the beach.while she was there she runs into this boy she likes.i would not recomend this book to someone under twelve. one reason is descuses things like kissing that might still be a little to mature for them.another reason is they might not understand all the emotions that come with the death factor that is brought up in this story. the last thing is i dont think they would be able to under stand all the broad vocabulary in this book. that is why i would and wouldn't recomend this book.
3,Olive's Ocean,"Olive's Ocean is by Kevin Henkes (of Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse fame). When I read the recommendation in Booklist for this Newbery Honor book, I decided to order it for our school's library. Renaissance Learning identified it as a 4.7 reading level. This seemed to be a book that would appeal to our fourth and fifth graders. I thought that Kevin Henkes would create a novel that would appeal as much to our older students as his his picture books appeal to our younger students.Please be aware that this book has quite a bit of profanity. It also has many sexual references. These two bits of information are not included in the reviews. Olive's Ocean is really more appropriate for students in middle or high school. I would not have purchased it for our elementary students had I been aware of this."
4,"Actually, 4.5 stars","This was a pretty good book. It had interesting content and intriguing plot twists. I would recommend it, however, it isn't all glitter. There are some dragging parts, some aspects that could have been left out and some things could have been elaborated upon. But, all in all, i would certainly recommend it! Besides, who am i to complain? I read it in just a few hours!"
5,A Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse for older readers,"Olive's Ocean is a great book about a girl named named Martha who has a complicated life. After Olive, a girl in Martha's class, dies in an accident, Martha feels somewhat guilty. In Olive's last journal entry she hoped for three things: she wanted to become a writer, she hoped that one day she could go to an ocean, and she wanted to become friends with Martha. Now Martha is trying to fulfill Olive's dreams for herself, and Olive.This book has won the Newbery Honor and captures the hearts and minds of girls ten-fifteen who also cherished the book Walk Two Moons by Sharon Creech.Kevin Henkes is a great fiction author who writes books for all ages. His writing is award winning from Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse to Olive's Ocean."
4,Martha's Amazingly Awkward Excursion,"I would definitely recommend the book Olive's Ocean by Kevin Henkes. I found I was unable to put it down. I liked this book because it was not your typical book based on a teenage girl's summer. The main character, Martha wasn't al that interested in being popular or fitting in, her mind was set on other things. However, she was somewhat interested in boys. Martha didn't thrive being a fashion designer or work at a hair salon; she wanted to be a writer."
4,Book review for Olive's Ocean by Kevin Henkes,"Olive's Ocean is an emotional and captivating book that allows the reader to relate to the characters. I enjoyed reading this book especially because it takes unexpected turns and lets the reader feel as if they are inside the book experiencing what the characters are experiencing. My favorite part of the book was when Martha uses the ocean water to write Olive's name on the ground where Olive once sat. My least favorite part was when Martha was told about the bet made between Jimmy and his brothers that ended up hurting and embarrassing Martha. This was very disappointing to me. I would recommend this book to young adults who enjoy reading fiction books that have emotion and romance in them because these things are found in this book. This book does not have very much adventure, suspense, or mystery so I do not recommend this book to readers who look for these characteristics."
1,Profanity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this book for my son because it is a Newberry Award Winner. Unfortunately he read it before I did. He learned many new vocabulary words from this book. Unfortunately they were profanity words!! I was shocked to read so many ""bad"" words in this book. It amazes me that a book with such language could win a Newberry Award. I do NOT recommend this book unless you want your child to start swearing."
2,Mountaintop Motel Massacre,"Cheesy 80's drive-in feature starring Anna Chappell as Evelyn Chambers, a recently released mental patient who is the owner of the Mountaintop Motel, a rundown motel in the backwoods of a small town. After she accidentally kills her daughter, Evelyn is sparked by voices who tell her to kill every guest that stays at the motel in the future - and now the survivors who have noticed the many deaths occuring, must fight for their lives as the crazy old bat continues her rage on everyone. Complete with creepy atmosphere but essentially bad acting and a bad script, this film is slightly enjoyable for the main fact that it's so corny. Some of the acting is alright, most notably from Major Brock I believe it is, who plays Crenshaw. It's extremely bad, but very funny and sometimes very creepy."
1,I yawned more than 1000 times during my viewing of this!,"I have seen many cheesy horror flicks before but none as bad as this one. I watched this with my cousin and we were quite disappointed with everything about it - the acting, the storyline, the music and sound etc. I was even turned off by the fact that the woman on the front cover wasn't even Evelyn! I often wonder why people even bothered to make this movie.It is just plain bad."
1,They should have called this: MOUNTAINTOP MOTEL BORE!,"MOUNTAINTOP MOTEL BORE would have been a better name.I am into these old, 70/80s horror flicks (POLTERGEIST TRILOGY,THE OMEN), and I was expecting this film to be great.However, this movie was a great disappointment.An old lady goes slightly insane, killing her daughter's pets and then eventually her daughter. After this, she opens up her own little motel where she is at full insanity and begins hiding out underneath the floors and coming up to hack every guests.This movie is too long and boring. The acting is terrible, which I expected because the cast members have never been heard of.The story is weak and I'd say that this movie is just plain [junk].Trust me, go rent a POLTERGEIST movie. This movie is horrible."
2,"Very Seventies, very Long, very something...",I have mixed feelings after watching this movie. I like it but not as much as other 80's drive-in exploitation. I can't help but feel that it feels like an incomplete movie with a non-ending that implies that the daughter who is killed at the beginning is haunting the motel. The movie feels very inconclusive and from the beggining you never get a good idea of what the hell the daughter is about anyway. Except for maybe that she is obviously practicing witchcraft of some sort. The old woman who does all the killing is just not bizarre enough for my tastes. She should have been a real freak. Her idea of tortuing her guests by putting rats in their rooms is kinda weak. This film is fun but it's not that fun.
3,drive-in horror film from 1983.,"Newly released from an insane asylum, Evelyn returns home to run her remote mountain-top hotel. In a fit of psychotic rage, she kills her daughter, then she starts killing her hotel guests, one by one.Although the film is low-budget, it does have its charms. The hotel guests are unique and colorful, particularly the ""preacher"" character. He has some witty dialogue with other characters in the film.Evelyn could compete with Freddy Kruger as one of the most outright zany characters you'll find on film.The horror itself is done in a campy sort of style. Definitely has a ""drive-in"" feel to it. Fun to watch."
3,An ok cheezy slasher!,"This film is not the best slasher for Terror Train and Friday The 13th are by far better; however its not the worst b/c it has great atmoshpere and some creepy scenes! Actually the recent horror film with luke wilkinson ""Vacancy"" , took the idea of a motel with secret tunnels under neath each motel room with trap doors on all the bathroom floors, under the rug,for all the guests to be butchered at night! Thats one of the reasons this film is so original and also the gore is pretty good for a low budget film. I had many laughs because there is some great humor in this, like the preacher with rats in his room, horrid acting by some characters, and the two cousins who think they can sing but they really cant! This slasher gem is worth a look but only if you dont take it seriously!"
3,"Not a bad movie, but don't be fooled by the cover","Don't expect what you see on the DVD cover - in fact, the crazed woman in the doorway does not even appear in the film. It appears that this DVD is being marketed to those expecting a ""cheesy"" horror film (one filled with laughs, mostly unintentional) but in fact, this movie is a typical low budget 80s slasher, and not a bad one at all. Just a warning to those expecting a funny horror movie - this is not one of those at all."
5,Doll value,I am formilair with this book. It is a great book IF you know the name of your doll. If you don't it is not a good one for you.
1,Very disappointing!,"I bought this book to help me determine the value of a collection of high quality dolls that my aunt wants to help her sell. Our of five doll designers, only one of the designers was even listed in her book. This was a waste of my money, for sure!"
1,"Blue Book Dolls and Values, 16th Edition","I have been collecting dolls for over 25 years and very few were listed in this book. I bought the book under the premise that it was a guide to ALL dolls and could give an accurate value of the doll. However, what I found was a very one-sided book with doll pictures belonging to Jan Foulke and those dolls seemed to be listed at a higher value, meaning her book is a platform to sell her own collection. Needless to say, I purchased the book on a Tuesday and returned it on Wednesday. I WOULD NOT RECOMMED THIS BOOK TO ANY DOLL COLLECTOR! The book I recommend is DOLL VALUES - ANTIQUES TO MODERN."
5,perfect!,these are perfect for nails. you can use one for 3-4 sets of nails. will buy more when needed for sure.
4,"Great Teddy Pendergrass ""Close the Door"" Sample","This is actually a CD that was released to promote the album ""The Brothas Unda Madness: Life & Times."" It couldn't be purchased in stores, and that's also why the picture shows a CD case with no insert (there's only a back cover).Elevation makes great use of a Teddy Pendergrass sample, though some people may not like the fact that the instrumental includes the vocals of the song's hook.The tracklisting:1. Elevation (Free My Mind) - Radio - 3:572. Elevation (Free My Mind) - Instrumental - 4:043. 6 Figures and Up - Radio - 4:164. 6 Figures and Up - Instrumental - 4:49The lyrics are decent, it's mostly the ""Close the Door"" sample that makes this a hot CD single. It's rare and expensive because the only way you'd own this is if you received it as a promo, since it wasn't for sale in music stores."
1,Lasted under 6 months,Bought one of these for $60 brand new at walmart. It didn't even last 6 months before the power supply died.
5,Mea Culpa!,My comments above about the book being dated were a bit off! I have a copy of Make Your Own Shoes and Handbags and it was published in 1978. The book in this listing is a more recent edition!All I can say in my defense is that I was so enthralled by the book that I was blinded to such sundry things as dates. My apologies to the author as well as my thanks for all her hard work in making new editions over the years.
1,"Do not believe the ""Instantly check temperature""","I bought this fork for only one reason. The ad says, and I quote, ""Instantly check temperature and doneness of beef, lamb, veal, pork, turkey, chicken or fish"". Well, guess what, it takes as long as the fork I presently use. I just put the fork into a glass of hot water and it took about 25 seconds to register. I gave it one star only because I want anyone else that thinks it will register temperature instantly to know the truth."
4,Very Impressive - a complete album,Great CD from da boys. Rivals Demigod and thats impressive...The killers on this one:At the Left Hand ov GodLiberthemeInner SanctumChristgrinding Avenue
4,a drummer to watch,"now that Dimmu lost Nick Barker, Behemoth's drummer is arguably the best metal drummer around. believe it."
2,"I tried, but its bad","I'm a huge fan of Behemoth, so its disappointing to write this little blurb. Unfortunately, sandwiched between the masterpieces that are Demigod and Evangelion, is this sorry effort. The Apostasy is a study in randomly ordered blast beats, growling, and breakdown riffing. It seemed like the only idea Behemoth had for this album was to make it as loud and incoherent as possible. There is zero flow to the majority of the songs, or the album in general. ""Rome CE 64"" and ""At the Left Hand Ov God"" were the only tracks I found listenable. The others are best forgotten. And really, track 11 is called ""Christgrinding Avenue""? That's a title you find on a piece of crap Cradle of Filth EP, not a Behemoth tune.Bottom line, skip The Apostasy. Go straight from Demigod to the epic Evangelion (which I couldn't take out of my CD player for 3 weeks straight). \m/"
3,WTF? This is nowhere NEAR Demigod.,"Talk aboot the most mediocre death metal album of the year! Behemoth didn't try anything new in this album. It's all the same as Demigod and Zoa Kia (Which were great). First of all Nergal's voice sounds like Dani FIlth trying to growl in this album. Don't forget that the music is just plain boring!And I don't need anyone criticizing my reveiws, I have my own opinion. I will keep it."
3,Overview,"If you want an overview title that touches on the basic concepts of Web Application development - this is a decent choice if you must have a physical book. However, I don't really feel it is worth the steep price.This book starts out with a very brief introduction to SQL, DB Design, programming and XML. Keep in mind, this is no substitute for real college courses if you want a career as a web app developer - but it will show you the tip of the iceberg.What is interesting about this book is that it covers five different web app technologies - ASP.NET, Java/JSP, PERL/CGI, PHP and ColdFusion. So if you don't know what technology you're interested in, here's a chance to preview them all. If you've already made a decision to use a specific technology, you're better off buying a book that focuses exclusively on your choice."
1,Nancy Drew without the talent,"This so-called mystery is one of the most maddeningly awful books I've ever wasted time reading. Anyone with average intelligence and at least ten years of age will figure out most of it halfway through. The worst part is, it turns out to be no real mystery at all--no crime of any kind, just spurious atempts to raise tension as a young woman goes padding about an old house in the middle of the night, solving things. Ms. Seely should be ashamed of herself, and Avalon must publish almost any manuscript mailed in. Stay away from this dog."
4,Nice set,"This is a nice set and the colors are unique compared to most sets. I would have like to see it come with a couple extra pieces in case you lose one. Also the black pieces are not a shiny black but a dusky black. All the same , my kids love it . It got here quickly as well."
4,pillow case,"I like the product for the most part, but the first time that I washed it the pillow case faded a little bit. Other than that I am very satisfied."
5,Great Sibelius Cycle,"UPDATE (1/08): You can get the whole Collins Sibelius cycle in a (in my opinion) better remastering and more inexpensively from Australian Decca/Eloquence from Buywell.The entire Anthony Collins'/LSO Sibelius Cycle cycle has been just re-released (January 2006) in a 4 CD set by Beulah. If you're interested in this cycle, you should buy the whole 4-CD set from a UK classical music store - it's a better deal than the $20.00 or more per disc being charged by sellers here. The 4 CD set contains Symphonies 1-7, plus some tone poems and other music. Again, the set is available from UK classical CD websites - if interested look these up on Gramophone.co.uk.UPDATE (1/2009): You can get all of these recordings in better remastering (in my opinion) from Australian Decca Eloquence at buywell.com."
2,Nope,II have been trying to find somegood catnip for my furgirlsbut this catnip did nothing!I will try something elsa!
3,The book is a little out of date.,"I would love to read an updated version that includes the later G4 laptops and G5 desktops. However, if you're truly technically oriented, you may find this book over-simplifies too much and glosses over many details. I found it useful for explaining the physical operation of hard drives and CD-ROMS, but found its explanations of computer architecture and software lacking."
1,Not humorous,"Being a choir director, I bought this book hoping it would supply some jokes or icebreakers that I could use at the beginning of practice with the choir; I read through the whole book in less than five minutes. No jokes, no icebreakers. There were little known facts, cartoons, silly vocabulary such as D.C. al Fine: Famous French composer, Out of the mouths of babes saying such as you might find in your email but nothing that I could really use for the choir; just a 5 minute entertainment. I was very disappointed and certainly would not buy this book if I had it to do over."
3,Engaging redux!,"Not until I was into this did I realize I had read it before. But it's still Nora and it was still entertaining.A Will and a Way was entertaining but Boundary Lines was fascinating in that I think Nora was practicing for her "".....In Death"" series. Some of the dialogue between Jillian and Aaron was quite the same as some of the interchange between Eve and Roarke. I loved it anyway!!! It's an addition to my collection."
5,Vintage Roberts!,"Engaging The Enemy by Nora Roberts was my favorite of the two here, I dubbed it VINTAGE ROBERTS! I am a Nora Roberts fan and think all of her books are great, but I really got in to Engaging The Enemy. The characters are colorful, the dialogue interesting, and the plot, a real page turner. A very appealing combination!John SavoySavoy InternationalMotion Pictures INC.Beverly Hills, California"
4,Better than expected,"This book actually contains two stories that were previously published in the late 80s. The first story involves co-benficiaries to an estate, and the second is about two competing ranchers. I found the second story more believable and interesting than the second; it was a classic love/hate relationship with lots of character drama. Roberts' books have been republished lately with amazing speed, but these are definitely better than some of her early stories that are currently on shelves. If you're a romance fan, you'll enjoy them."
5,Excellent,"For the First time, Gay or Lesbian traveller to Europe this book is fun and insightful. It gave us some great ideas and we enjoyed the stories."
1,Broken Darts,"We purchased this dart board for our children for Christmas and within 3 days all the darts were broken. I tried to purchase replacement darts at the local retailers but they do not fit. Only Excalibur darts fit. I called the Company and after being put on hold several times, I was told they are out of darts. They do not know when they will be available, they do not accept back orders, and the receptionist was very rude. What good is the dart board without darts that fit? When I asked to speak to a manager, I was told they are all on vacation. I am returning the product and will buy a different brand name that takes a standard size dart!"
3,A nice overview of available information,"This is a nice reference to introduce you general issues, anatomic structures, and therapeutic and surgical techniques involved in the care of patients with craniofacial anomalies."
5,Buy this book,"If I were only allowed to own one graphics book, this would be it. In addition to a super ""real-time"" book, it is just a plain super graphics book."
2,Not relevant content,I belive the content is not relevant if you are into game programming today. The content is not updated in some areas leaving black holes for the reader.
3,Searching for Life: The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo,Tragic story. The grandmothers are courageous and persistent in their pursuit of justice and reuniting of children and their families. I only wish the author had better editing to help the flow of the story and supporting facts.
2,Very disappointed,"*SPOILER ALERT* I am a huge Nan Ryan fan, working my way through all of her titles. This one left me cold, mostly because neither the hero nor heroine is a particularly likeable character. Nick spends the majority of the book as the lover of another woman, and those scenes are far better written than the one love scene he has with Kay near the very end of the book. That is not my idea of ""romance"". Kay is truly a bible-thumping harpy who does nothing to endear herself to the hero until a very rapid fall from grace that makes a mockery of all the religious piety she had been preaching. I just did not care about these two, but it earns an extra star for interesting secondary characters. Please don't read this one as your first by this author, because her others are so much better. Start with ""Savage Heat"", ""You Belong to My Heart"" or ""Love Me Tonight"" for a better reflection of this wonderful writer's talent."
1,worst battery for video camera,"after two months this low class, cheap, bad quality battery stopped working. I still cannot believe the battery stop retaining its charge after two month of usage.Be carefull when ordering from this person. They sale really cheap but very bad quality products.."
4,Compressor works best,This product is great if you connect it to a small compressor and able to adjust the regulator to about 25-40psi. the cans of air just dont cut it.
2,Doesn't perform as promised,I bought this item to assist in removing paint. It doesnt work well for that. Creates a lot of dust with not much effect. Just doesnt seem to have enough power. I would not recommend this item for large projects.
2,Should not be your first book on the Corsair.,"Anything by Berret Tillman is better. I did not like the fact that a large portion of the book is chapters from other books like Fred ""Crash"" Blechmans, Bent Wings, F4U Corsair Action & Accidents.Some good photos, but overall, not as good as some other books on the subject.For a great history Berret Tillman's Corsair The F4U in World War II and Korea is the best.For technical info, Americas Hundred thousand is the best bang for the buck, since it covers all American fighters of the War in great techical detail.If you have everything in print but this, get it, but if you need good info there are others books to go with first."
4,God Is In The Small Stuff,"""God Is In The Small Stuff"" by Bruce and Stan is an encouraging read for the person who needs a quick and practical read for realizing how much God is involved in the details of our lives.The book is around 250 and contains 40 topics such as:1. You can know God's will.2. Give God time.3. Simplify life and enjoy it more.4. Arrange your priorities.5. Encouragement is a gift.6. Relationships take time.7. How to really love your spouse/children/teenager.8. A generous spirit works wonders.Each topic is around 5 pages, summarizes the topic and how God is and can be a part of it, and closes with practical suggestions on how to make the topic relevant in your life.An encouraging and challenging read. Recommended."
1,JUNK,"I bought this piece of junk today and it didn't fire at first with the .2 BBs but then I figured, buy the .12s and see. Well, I was excited that it fired finally but then the inner part of the grenade broke off and kept causing the thing to explode as I let go with me standing over it! good thing the manager told me to try it and return it if it broke. ugggh!"
4,Nice construction-grade set for the serious craftsman,"The right product, the right price, the right sizes. I bought this set for those reasons, and haven't been disappointed. I needed to upgrade to a newer set, and wanted to buy all 4 of my most commonly used levels at once. These are comfortable, accurate, reasonably heavy-duty, with cushioned ends. Fit and finish seems good. Not digital, not laser, just a good practical daily use tool for someone who makes their living from their tools."
2,The Reading Material Is Just Not Interesting,"I suppose some people will enjoy reading recipes and menus in Spanish, but I found them a chore. Much of the reading material in this book simply doesn't interest me. I do think the reading reviews and workbook-like sections of the book have good information, particularly if you enjoy the readings. However, I didn't find the reading material any more interesting than what you'd find in a beginning or intermediate Spanish textbook. After spending a little bit of time with this book, I decided that it just wasn't my cup of tea. I went down to the library and checked out some Curious George books and I find them far more entertaining and useful in terms of applying my Spanish. Full disclosure: I am a beginning Spanish student."
3,Oh Well,"I highly recommend this book for readers of history. I am giving this book a three stars for the simple reason is that Mr. Woodson is telling the truth, but he obviously has disdain for his subjects. He has a very elitist posture and it annoys the hell of me as reader."
4,Clear and concise,"To prepare for my first semester teaching statistics, I asked several colleagues for advice and references. Texts by Brunk and DeGroot were very useful and helped me organize and clarify for my students the material in our ""statistics for engineers"" text. Recently I discovered the three wonderful volumes by Hoel, Port, and Stone. In particular I found nice pictures to illustrate and explain the central limit theorem. There are also many exercises and worked examples. The next statistics course I teach will be greatly improved thanks to these books and the work that went into writing them."
3,I am stunned that the publisher has turned this isnt a 140 dollar new text.,"I used this book as an undergraduate. Its a good text in the sense that it cuts to the chase... but its not that good and its short. 140 dollars for a new version of this text is the publisher milking the textbook industry. If you at all have an option buy old edition of something else or something. [Casella, Statistical Inference comes to mind]There is nothing modern or comprehensive or unusually easy to understand in this text. Note that this text has not changed sinced 1971. Not a word. So there are many old editions of many old text that cover the same material. It does what it does decent... I am glad to own it. But it doesnt do it 140 dollars worth. And wasnt 140 dollars for a new version until recently."
4,Easier to understand than some...,"I am not a tarot expert, let me state that right now. But having ""played"" around with tarot for the better part of ten years, I know some books are easier to understand than others. This book gives you a more detailed explanation of a card's meaning (both forward and reversed) than the ""guide"" traditionally found in tarot decks. BUT this book isn't nearly as detailed and helpful as others that are out there. All in all, a good basic book for someone who's just looking for the basics or a good place to start."
2,Not for the Serious Student,"We had high hopes for this book, as many Tarot books read somewhat dryly, but after a few chapters it became apparent that this is not a book for the serious student. The book itself was focused on using the Tarot in relationship issues, in which it certainly excels. However, it can be used for so much more, something this book does not touch upon. The approach to reading the cards seemed somewhat flippant, and more suited for someone with just a passing interest in learning how they work. Although it did provide several amusing moments, this is not a book we would recommend for a beginner. For the more experienced reader, it would be more of a novelty item than a useful tool."
5,9/11 Revisited,"7 Days in September is the finest film that I have seen yet regarding the tragedy of 11September2001. It shows how the people of New York came together in a way that they never have before (and, with the tragic way our country has become so fiercely partisan since then) haven't since.Being a radical movie buff myself, there are very few movies that I would say are a must see. But 7 Days in September is a must see in order to understand what happened. This documentary brings back the tragedy of that day and all the feelings associated with it.Buy it here at Amazon, rent it at a video store (if you must) or even borrow it from a friend. But, if you remember that horrific time, watch this movie and share it with others. The beginning of overcoming the problem of radical hatred is understanding the what, who, how and why. This film will aid you in that."
3,an interesting piece,"the most captivating genre of the film is how raw and in shock everyone is.It takes you right back to that surreal frightening tragic time.A worthy buy,as a reminder of the day the world changed."
2,The way not to end a terrific series..,"""Mostly Harmless"" is the last of the ""Hitchhiker"" books, and I do wish that it wasn't. The ending did tie off a lot of loose ends, but it did the readers a terrible disservice. Frankly, I hope this was a dream concocted by the dolphins of ""So Long..."". Anyway, Arthur Dent, the Everyman, and Ford Perfect, the flaky Alien, are at it again. Not a lot of humour in this one. Trillian having a daughter by artifical insemination didn't work at all, and this really set up one of the wrost endings I've ever read. Thanks for nothing, Douglas Adams. You are missed, however."
2,"Great DNA read, highly recommended but not in kindle format","This read is a fun, light hearted poke at some serious questions. Enjoyed the ride immensely. However, the kindle version of this book is poorly converted, there are grammatical errors (inconsistent with the original) and the great idea of having material to view at the end is largely ruined for iPhone app users due to lack of a zoom function, rendering the material impossible to read and fairly useless. Get your act together amazon! You're ruining a great product."
4,Back where you belong.,"I've read almost all of the reviews and weirdly the biggest plot point in the novel, that's it's an alternate universe, has been missed by everyone. Like Dirk Gently the novel hangs pretty much on one turn of phrase about five leaf clovers and how normal they are throughout the universe. And some planted clues about different dimensions and philosophy talk.One of the things I liked best about these novels when I was young was how dark they were. 'So Long' was not exactly the same to me, but this one is.It's not perfect, but the fearless take everybody down a notch including yourself mentality is back. And it belongs there."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Multiple planet waxings are dull.Or, why the hell did we read this book. Ok, the answer to that one is obvious, but anyway, this one can happily be avoided and you aren't missing anything. Even the potential best amusing bits aren't really, with Ford's corporate masters, and Arthur, yet again on Earth putting up with some very strange new behaviour by the people there."
4,4 Stars - Qualified...,"I've had <u>Mostly Harmless</u> on my shelf for many years. I can't remember when I got it, nor could I remember reading it. A couple of weeks ago, I started with <u>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy""</u> and read through the series. <U>Mostly Harmless</u> ostensibly the 5th book in the trilogy (this <i>is</i> Douglas Adams, RIP).The book is fast paced...leading you to an ending that closes the series for good (although you could argue that there's certainly an opening after the <u>So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish</u> shenanigans.Anyway, if you've read the other four books in the trilogy, you'll enjoy this last one, until the very end, much like Mr. Adams' life."
2,By now the series is tired...,"This fifth book in the five-book trilogy from great author Douglas Adams doesn't have the silly charm or comic punch of the first three, and instead has the confusing, incoherent narrative of the boring fourth, ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish."" The plot is difficult to explain, since this book has virtually no direction or any kind of solid narrative. Not only is it ridiculous, but it's confusing. While the original three were splendid comedy gems, this one is a forced whimper that doesn't hold up and has no memorable qualities. I guess it was time for the series to end."
4,It's entertainment,"Douglas Adams still does a wonderful job of doing what he does best - entertaining the reader with his off-beat but on-time sense of humor. This book didn't let me down in the least, except for finding myself killed-off in the end, and was entertaining from beginning to end. The sub-plots about the ""sandwichmaker"" and the short but incredibly thought-inspiring chapter about Arthur finding ""Earth"" in another universe were in line with Adams' style of wit. I liked it."
5,Still funny,The fifth and last book in the `trilogy' is a real return to form after the forth book.It is very funny at times and more closely plotted than some of the others in the series.There were some cracking lines and characters and perhaps an unexpectedly darker edge to the proceedings. It was good to see the return of some old and much loved characters and species.They way that things are tied up and the satirical elements and actually having a workable plot really do leave me in awe of the talents of Douglas Adam's.There can't be that many authors who could get so many laughs from sandwich making
2,Great series ends with a dud,Probably the worst of the series. It was quirky but never evoked more than a chuckle. It was also more confusing than the other books. So the combination of not that funny and confusing didn't work out so well. I am glad to have finally finished a series I started more than 20 years ago but not sure I really needed to read this one.At least one of the other reviewers mentioned that the narrator wasn't that great but liked him a lot.
2,Mean and Bitter Tone Throughout,"Before reading this book, I was extremely cautious to avoid any information/review which might spoil and prejudice my opinion. In that I was successful.It had been a while since reading the other four books, so they were not on my mind and in fact I worried about forgetting minor plot points and whether that would affect my enjoyment.I needn't have worried. There was nothing enjoyable about Mostly Harmless. I was overwhelmed by a sense of bitterness coming from the prose, found myself wondering, ""Does he even *like* these characters?""It struck me as the work of a man who hated what he was doing and wanted to kill it in the most complete and irrevocable way possible.Two stars for occassional flashes of the non-bitter Adams."
2,disappointing,Mostly Harmless was the most disappointing conclusion to a series since Sienfeld. Adam's seemed to have lost his empathy for the characters. Fans who enjoyed Marvin's grim outlook on life will be pleased to see that it has infected the rest of the group. (kind of like the cyberminds of the cabin robots infected the squirrels on Lamuella)Too bad it had to end like this...
2,DONT READ,"After reading all the others, this book was really disappointing. not enough about the charactors you wanna hear about, too much aout others. Ocasionaly funny, but not very. Still leaves you hanging at the end. I you read the others, DONT READ THIS! it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth!!!"
3,Mostly harmless indeed,"Mostly Harmless is the fifth book of the Hitchhiker's Guide trilogy, and as such, it's worth reading. However, in many ways I think that its title is a little too apt.This is my least favourite Hitchhiker book, because it left me slightly depressed by both its storyline and its position as the final book of the trilogy. Even so, it has sequences that are too funny to be missed, most notably the story of (and our hero Arthur's confusion about) the King. Furthermore, it answers questions and clarifies some issues, and it also provides some closure for the characters that readers of the books have come to care about."
1,Looks pretty harmfull to me...,"It all started so great, sigh.... The original Hitchhicker's guide was awesome. My mom hates Sci-Fi and even she picked that one up. ""Mostly Harmless"", though, is something entirely different. I guess that Adams should have stopped with the series after ""So long and thanks for all the fish"". The first parts with Ford Prefect and his exploits with Collin the security robot were rather good, but after he met up with Arthur Dent again things took a turn for the worst, although things had alread gone bad after Trillian and Arthurs daughter showed up. In the main part of the book the great, typical Adams sense of humor is replaced by a weak attempt to write a semi-serious(family) drama with random outburst of rather corny jokes.In short: this novel is a greater disaster than the final destrucion of planet/supercomputer Earth woul be. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book. If you have already bought it, burn it and burry it."
1,Mostly Awful,"For fans of the original, this book will break your heart. None of the pure joyous fun that made the original ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" so great are contained in any way in these pages. After reading the book, I couldn't help but think, ""What was Adams thinking!?"". Is this a cruel trick on his fans? Is he just so cynical and burnt out that he just doesn't care what he publishes?"
2,Did he lose a wife or daughter himself?,"It's not funny, first of all, and how can you call it an HHGG book if it's not funny? But aside from the basic lack of humor, it seems almost like a rebuttal to ""So long and thanks for all the fish."" It throws Fenchurch (and the retrieved Earth) away like so much used kleenex, and gives Arthur in return a satisfying job making sandwiches... It's as if he (Adams) got upset at himself for having written a book in which Arthur finds love.But then Arthur finds he has a teenage daughter who's feeling lost and unloved, so maybe love has a chance after all? No. [Spoiler alert] The daughter's last action in life is to try to shoot Arthur, and to accidentally kill an innocent bystander, and then, as she realizes she's murdered someone, the world ends -- not just the one, but all possible Earths. Sweet, huh? I wish I hadn't read it."
4,Part Five- What the Zark?,"Lots of crazy, unexpected, tee-tawing fun. Though fun, the book it somewhat sad due to the ending. There are no happy endings here. It is sad not only because the universe ends, but because the five-part trilogy comes to an end. I found this book especially funny as it focused on Arthur Dent's life (the hero who only lacked two things in life- the world he was born on and the woman he loved.) However, as the story strays away from Arthur Dent, the story strays from interest. The introduction of Arthur's child is about as interesting as the introduction of Arthur's lover in the previous book.In ranking the `enjoyablility' of the books in this series, I would make this book #4 behind the first three books in the series (in order) and making the fourth book the least enjoyable at #5. But while considering my ranking, remember this- anything that, in happening, causes itself to happen again, happens again. It doesn't necessarily do it in chronological order, though."
5,a perfect conclusion,"I absolutely love the ending of the five-book ""trilogy"". It is a down note, yes, but satisfying in that the characters themselves are tired and I am glad to se Arthur and Ford finally find their peace in the whole mess. This beek really helped me understand the concept of finality (in every sense and dimension). Truly brilliant."
2,"Well, it was mostly harmless","I agree that this was the most disappointing in the Hitchhiker series. Compared to the hillarious antics in the first volumes, I barely chuckled with this one. It really seems rather pointless, and when you finally figure out where Adams was going with the story, it was all over. I'm not even sure he knew where he was going to begin with."
2,Over and Out,"Adams certainly didn't need any more money or acclaim. He wanted the series put to rest, permanently, and that's what he did. Any questions?"
1,Mostly disappointing,"I guess it had to end this way. The original radio version of ""Hitchhiker"" was the high-water mark. The television version wasn't as good. The books have gotten worse and worse. There really weren't many jokes here and the miserable ending was so totally lacking in imagination that I was really angry at myself for having read this book. It's as if Mr. Adams was tired of the story and characters but not the revenue stream."
2,Not Harmless at all - almost retroactively ruins the series!,"When I finished this book, my first reaction was that I wish it had never been written. It seemed to me that Adams was simply sick of the characters, and had to real desire to write this book. He took out his frustration on the characters and the readers. What's worse, I don't think I'll ever be able to enjoy the previous 4 books (yes, I very much liked ""So Long..."") the same way again, knowing where the series is heading. My advice would be, if you really liked the first 4, don't read this one. I grew up with the Hitchhikers' series, but now when I think about the books, the first thought that comes to mind is how awful ""Mostly Harmless"" is. I'm hoping that someday Adams will write a new HH book, one he WANTS to write, and give the series the ending it deserves."
2,A not-so-fond farewell to a classic series,"The Hitchhiker's ""Trilogy"" (as Adams wryly likes to put it) comes to an end in this fifth installment in the adventures of earthman Arthur Dent. Although not as thin on laughs as its predecessor, ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish,"" this book doesn't have the nonstop hilarity that made Adams a bestselling author. My favorite gag in the book centered on the Grebulons, a group of aliens that illustrates the evils of excessive television viewing. Still, I felt that the book mostly limped along, finally reaching a dreary end. I would have expected a series that has given readers so many laughs over the years to have either a funny or a poignant conclusion, but this tale has neither. It felt as though Adams was too tired of writing about his band of interstellar hitchhikers to give them the denouement that they deserved."
4,I Liked It Better Than The Last Two,"I made the mistake of reading other people's online reviews for this book after I had bought it but before I started reading it. I almost put it aside for fear that it would be as disappointing as so many readers have said it is. However, I have to disagree. This is a pretty darn good book. I LOVED the first two books in the series and really think that Adams should have just stopped there. The third and fourth books were, in my humble opinion, alright but not nearly as good. The whole thing with cricket in the third book just got on my nerves and the fourth book just didn't bring the closure that I craved. I thought that this book came much closer to to the flavor of the first two books and I personally did find the closure to the story in this book that I longed for. Recommended by me....as if you care."
2,Short of Magical,There was a connection that Arthur Dent made with his readers that carried one seamlessly through the first four books. The state of temporary immortality that he reaches in this book simply makes him less interesting.The appeal of the Hitchhiker series was always the conflict of normalcy and the extraordinary (like trying to get a spaceship to synthesize tea). This book just didn't find the right balance and the writing in this book gave off the general feeling that you might get from an unsatisfied sexual partner - that they are simply doing what they can to make the event end without hurting your feelings. This is the feeling I got from Adams' novel and it was all the more terrible because I always loved Adams.This book is not a fit end to the man's career. If you feel as though you have to read this to finish the series then please read the Dirk Gently books afterwards (even if you've already read them).
2,"If you are a fan, DON'T read this book","I tore through the first four books, and couldn't wait to read the fith and final book. Afterwords, I kinda with I hadn't. It seems tacked on, almost as if it was written without regard for the story up to that point. It lacks much of the humor and sensitivity of the first four. I'll just say it: I did not like this book one bit.For one thing, it was written in such a manner that it was hard to follow. And yes, I do like happy endings, and this book does not have one. Plus, it doesn't follow with the other books. We all already know that Earthers did not evolve on the planet, and that the Earth was replaced. So why would the HHGTG still say ""Mostly harmless"", instead of Ford's long-winded review of the planet? Lots of things in this book might make you think that it was written out of a desperate need for money, or by somebody else.If you love the series as much as I do, just skip this book. It is a disappointing end to a wonderful ""trilogy."""
1,Please pretend this book was never written.,"I have long been a fan of the Hitchhikers series as they are comic genius. The book Mostly Harmless, however, should never have come about. It is frustration at its peak. After reading this book I vowed to never read another Douglas Adams book again (not as though he got around to writing any more). This book contains nothing that resembles a story line and never gets past the character development stage. I happened to go to a talk he gave at the University of Texas a few years ago and he was asked about the ending of the Mostly Harmless and his excuse was that the hardest part of writing a new book is getting everyone back together after you scatter them to the ends of the universe in the previous book so this was his answer. If you ask me he wrote this book to pay off his new Porsche and cheat his fans. Go ahead and read the first 4 as they make up a great story by themselves but don't waste your time reading this drivel."
3,Just playing out the thread,"Not much I can add to most of the other reviews. It seems pretty clear in reading Mostly Harmless than Adams was just playing out the thread, either tying up loose ends, dipping his hand one last time into the till because he knew any continuation of the Hitchhiker series, however mediocre, would sell well, or whatever. And mediocre it is. Adams is an astonishingly funny writer, and his wit is enough to make the book a pleasant read (thus the three stars). But it's clearly lacking the energy that made earlier books in the series such a delight."
2,Not much of a conclusion...,"I loved the Hitchhiker's Guide--great combination of irreverent sci-fi humor and Monty-Python-esque quirkiness. I found myself laughing aloud as I read. Restaurant was similarly rollicking humor. But as the series progressed (and the books got thinner page-wise), it feels like Mr. Adams ran out of material or energy. ""Mostly Harmless"" is amusing at times, and there are flashes of the previous humor, where seeming tangential or trivial events are woven together with great imagination. But overall, this piece is disjointed and meandering. Those ""laugh out loud"" moments came less and less often. Even the villains are neither menacing nor silly, and the conclusion is totally unsatisfying. Unless you're someone who has a compelling need need to finish a literary series (see Frank Herbert's Dune series), I would recommend sticking with the first few books. You'll be left with better memories of Mr. Adams's wit and perspicacity."
2,"""Hitchhiker"" fans can't afford to read this book","If you're a fan of the ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" series, this is a book you can't afford to read. It will ruin what would otherwise be fond memories of a wonderful series.""Hitchhiker"" is one of the most tightly-woven stories ever written. Sometimes you'll only get a joke when you read the next book. The thought and love Douglas Adams put into the series are quite evident.With this travesty, however, one gets the feeling that his heart just wasn't in it. Like someone else said, you can almost hear him saying, ""there, here's your damn book, now leave me alone"".The whole tone of the series, of British melancholy humour, is simply absent. It's just depressing."
1,"Mr. Adams, I am disappointed!","What happened? The book was superb all of the way through. I read this book in one day and loved every minute, until the end that is. Everyone dies! What is going on here? All the great characters we have come to know and love are just finished off. It saddens me greatly that Douglas Adams has decided to quit writing Hitchhikers' Guide books. This kind of thing is terrible to do to science fiction fans. Just imagine if Gene Roddenberry had decided to say, ""Forget it!"" in the middle of his Star Trek career. Is this any way to treat your fans?"
4,"Not his best, but still worth reading.","I was going to give this book 3 stars, but I just couldn't bring myself to give Douglas Adams anything less than four. In fact, I quite liked most of this book, esp. the part about The King, and the pink and chrome ship. What I hated about it was the end; not so much the loss of some of my favorite literary characters, but the abrupt finish of the book. I got the feeling that Mr. Adams just got tired of writing the book, or maybe the series, and ended it. Or maybe it's just that I'm disappointed that there won't be anymore. Still, definitely worth reading if you're a Douglas Adams fan."
4,Thank you again Mr. Adams.,"It would seem that you either like this book or you hate it. I fall into the 'like it' category. I found plenty of humor, fun and all around general silliness. Which is why I read Mr. Adams works. It wasn't the best in the series, but you have to take into consideration that it was the last in the series and it's not an epic drama. I am thoroughly happy with the book. Very glad I spent the time and money on it. I had to force myself to put it down a couple of times. And Mr. Adams, if your out there, please, please, please get on your duff and do some writing. The universe could use some more of your books to lighten the WSGMM. Thank you. P.S. Vogons bite."
5,Excellent conclusion to a masterful trilogy,"Despite all the people who seem to think this book is awful, I have to say I loved it. I think that the last chapter is a very good conclusion to the trilogy. To those who stupidly wish that the trilogy would go on and on, all I can do is point to SLATFATF, the lowpoint of the trilogy. A series can only go on so long, and then it has to end. If the author is forced to keep producing, either he will produce a load of crap, or he will start repeating things.There was a danger of this happening in the Trilogy, even Douglas Adams can only take a plot so far. This one had been milked for all it was worth and needed to end. Adams found and ending, that fit the nature of the trilogy and so ended the thing perfectly. I for one am glad that Adams to pull out before things got much worse, and frankly I loved the ending."
4,"Mostly Harmless, Moslty Good but not all good",I have read all of the series and have started on other Adams' books and I can honestly say Mostly Harmless has a few good laughs. It is not the greatest Adams book but is a must read. Those who liked the old hitchhiker series style may not like this book. I liked the original settings of tyhe first three books in the series but I can also apreciate a change in setting. Overall this book and the series are the kinds of books I've been looking for.
3,Mostly harmless is mostly useless,"It always has to happen eventually. An author gets tired of being pestered about the next sequel and finishes everyone off. Arther Conan Doyle did it to Holmes, and now Douglas Adams does it to the Hitchhikers bunch. While the impulse to pick up his marbles and go home might be easily understandable (""They're my characters and I shall do with them as I like"") it does rather ruin the good effect of a solid conclusion, such as ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish"" was. This is an awful anticlimax to a wonderful series.That said, there are a few glimmers of classic Douglas Adams fare. The bit about the sandwiches is arguably the funniest sketch in the series. Unfortunately it is itself sandwiched in among the worst story in the series. if you've read the first four novels in the trilogy, stop there."
2,"Slapstick, not wit... blah","I read HHGG many years ago, but never got around to Mostly Harmless when it came out. I saw it at the library the other day, and knew I had a quest to finish. Unfortunate.Instead of the cutting wit of the first stories, we get Jerry Lewis-esque slapstick, and Dr Seuss-like silly word play. The plot rambles and bumbles, but unlike the comedic diversions of its predecessors MH just fades away into more nothingness.MH gives us a smile here and a chuckle there, but after a short period of time I simply won't remember anything in particular about Book 5 - with the possible exception of the ending. That was a surprise."
5,A vastly confusing blank canvase,"The ending had my heart racing and mind reeling. But after the initial shock of it. Came a barrage of questions, then a brainstorm(s). Now this may not have been his final book, but a original ending. The Salmon Of Doubt was not continued, and may have lead to a different or continuing conclusion. But over all, this is a great ending, that will have you re-reading almost every third paragraph. A must to complete the series."
2,not very good,I'm amazed my the number of people who either love this book blindly because it's Douglas Adams or hate it because of the downer ending. I have no problem with downer endings. Unfortunately the book was simply not very good. Douglas Adams is past his prime. He should take up painting or golf.
2,really harmless,"Even though The Hitchhiker's storylines caracterize themselves for not being too coherent, which is probably one of its strong points, Mostly Harmless fails to achieve a ""proportionate"" incoherence with the other Hitchhiker's books. This novel is too far detached from the earlier books. Arthur Dent seems like Charlie Brown in the sense that he always loses on this one, and the one time that he wins (Stavromula Beta) its in the end, and the ending of this book is by far the worst of all of the series' endings."
2,Should've stopped the trilogy at 4,"It's a long fall when something so anticipated turns out to be so disappointing. After a very charming and wonderful ending to the series (So, Long and Thanks ...) Adams seems to just suddenly grab his characters and put them through an adventure that neither he nor they want very much to go through. The whimsy is forced and the humor is tired. Read the 1st four. Then, read Mostly Harmless at your own peril."
2,"Mostly harmless is ""mostly harmless"" - don't bother.","I was a fan of the ""original"" trilogy, but it appears that Mr. Adams has went to the well once too many times. There's no spark and hardly any new insight in this book. It was almost a chore wading through the book to find out what happened to our heroes (and heroine) that we loved in the first three books. It was a very disappointing way to end the series"
2,There are only four books in the Hitchiker saga.,"Reality, friends, is what you and I make of it. So I'm going to make a solemn declaration: This book does not exist. The Hitchiker series ended with ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish,"" a bright, funny, well-written book.It did not end with ""Mostly Harmless,"" which is the literary equivalent of an old man shouting ""Here! Here's your darn book! Now leave me alone!"" Adams is obviously tired of the series, and this book amounts to a middle finger to fans who begged for more. It's not funny, it's not smart, it's not that much fun to read. It doesn't take the series in any new directions; it exists only to finally shut up people who want another chapter in a finished series.It's not, all in all, a horrible book, just a monstrously disappointing one. Believe it with me, and we can make it so: SLATFATF was the last. There are only four. There are only four."
3,Revenge.,"I definitely agree that Adams was writing this as revenge. How can anyone read the description of what the Guide project has become and still not see that Adams is talking about his own series? You think it was an accident? Compare Ford's memories of the way it used to be with the way it is. Also, look at Ford as he runs up ""expenses"" on his new assignment. Adams is writing about himself. Its amazing that there are people who read this book who didn't see this."
2,Unfortunate that the 'trilogy' I loved so much ended like this.,"In many ways this book is just as interesting as previous books in the series. Adams humor is in tact and will have you snickering fairly often.The main problem is that of the overall plot. It is unsatisfying and pessamistic. Not just the ending. Tricia Mcmillian or Trillan turns from being a likable and symathetic character to somone who uses people and makes them clean up her mess. It is a heartbeakingly unfit end to a series I have such fondness for. This is compounded by the fact that the late Douglas Adams wished to write a sixth book after this one but never got around to it.At this point it is better to consider the fourth book the final guide since it has such a satisfyingly beautiful end. For those who love the works of Adams should read it anyway, since it is well... a douglas adams book. Just dont be to dissapointed when you are dissapointed."
1,Not even worth checking out of the library,"The first three Hitchhikers books are probably the most hilarious books I have ever read. The fourth, _So Long and Thanks for all the Fish_ was a great disappointment, and lacked the brilliant spark of the first three. _Mostly Harmless_ is mean spirited and largely devoid of humor. I think Adams not only has lost interest in these books, but has lost his muse. Sad to see him writing such junk as _Mostly_, I would presume just for the money. I felt cheated for buying this book, and I cannot even recommend checking it out of the library, as surely your time must be worth something"
4,Saved By A Multitude Of Friends,"CHALLENGE TO LASSIE is a fairly entertaining family film about Lassie's loyalty to her master even after the latter's death. The biggest danger to Lassie comes from the local law enforcement officials who want to kill her because she no longer has the proper license. Lassie gets all of the help she really needs from a group of concerned villagers, a nearby garrison of soldiers and a host of gutsy children.Edmund Gwenn stars as the dog's chief advocate and a strong supporting cast includes Donald Crisp, Alan Webb, Alan Napier, Henry Stephenson, Sarah Allgood, Geraldine Brooks and Reginald Owen. Richard Thorpe is known as a competent director of many movies including IVANHOE and THE STUDENT PRINCE."
1,prairie home companion,Never received it. Received a notice that it was lost. Have yet to receive a credit back to my credit card.This was my second attempt to purchase. Very disappointed
5,A modern triumph,"The Garden State soundtrack is rich and full of stories. A lot of what is missing from most pop songs today is the knack for storytelling or personal interest. Like the movie, the soundtrack presents a beautiful work, full of thought and attention. It is an eclectic mix of folk, pop, and bluesy music. Thievery Corporation does a great song with sitar and jazz trumpet. I am very impressed."
4,Interesting and serene music,"This CD introduced me to some interesting music which I would not have otherwise been aware of.The music is peaceful and dreamy.A little dark in some cases, but otherwise very enjoyable."
4,Mellow...,"Great album. Specially liked ""Let Go"" by Frou-Frou. However, slightly dissapointed that ""Orange Sky"" by Alex Murdoch was not included in the CD.Just a question though. What was the song which played in scene where Natalie Portman does a tap dance for Zach's character? This is after the swimmingpool scene and during the scene where Zach tells ""us"" why he was sent to boarding school and didn't come back for 9 years after."
5,A Perfect Mix,"Whether or not you saw this movie, I highly recommend owning the soundtrack. Great combination of songs that sets a really mellow mood. I've had this CD in my player for months...I keep it on in the background while I work and it's always inspiring. I especially love the additon of Simon and Garfunkel's ""The Only Living Boy in New York""...adds a sweet melancholy. If you did see the movie, it makes the CD that much better..."
5,garden state of mind,"I will see said movie three more times this week, and then i will stand looking over an empty earth-crater in the pouring rain wearing a garbage bag with 'only living boy in new york' turning over in my psyche, and i will just scream aloud from the lungs and throat and heart and head ... for everyone who needs it. a fierce, cleansing high decibel release - i promise. then i will drive home with squeaky acoustic thrums, lyrical profundity, and folktronic comfort rhythm in my cerebrum ... thoroughly 'in it' by choice, and i wouldn't have it any other numb or easy way.cuz blue eyes, you're the secret I keep ... and I just wanna sing a song with you.the soundtrack is such a perfectly intelligent, straight from the heart gift to an already amazing piece of celluloid. I couldn't think of a better way to weave evocative music into this film's delicate emotional fabric."
3,"""Don't Panic"" ""In the Waiting Line""...""Let Go""","Arguably the most over-rated soundtrack to date. It is probably true to say that the movie made the music sound more outstanding than it really is. Of course, many would argue that that in itself justifies a rating of better than 3 stars.There are some highlights including the gem by Simon & Garfunkel and ""New Slang"" by The Shins. But overall, there is some weak music here.GG NO RE."
2,Now That's What I Call Indie!,"The movie was pretty solid, the soundtrack is nothing special. It's a collection of some of the tamer hit tracks from the 2003 indie/college charts. Some of the tracks were mildly interesting when they came out, but most are just uninterestingly mild."
5,Great Soundtrack,"This is one of my favorite CDs, full of songs that are interesting and often meaningful. Highly recommend it."
5,A beautiful CD from a beautiful movie,"I've never done this before, but I was so moved by this movie and soundtrack that I thought others should know of its beauty. I had to go out of state to see the movie because nowhere around me had it playing. But it was by far worth it, and if you haven't seen the movie then I urge you to go and do so. After the movie was over I went to the nearest music store I could find and bought the soundtrack. It was beautifully done and matched the feeling of the movie so well. Zach Braff deserves high praises for his work. It is truely a work of art. I've had the CD playing since the moment I got it. It is so calming and touching. A must have for anyone who enjoys good music."
3,Just buy The Shins album,"I decided to buy this soundtrack after reading all the rave reviews here on Amazon. After I gave it a few listens I wish I hadn't. The best tracks are the two from The Shins, and you can get them both on ""Oh, Inverted World"", which I would recommend over this CD. The rest of the songs are very mellow and, in my opinion, bland. However, I haven't seen the movie, so if you really love the movie it could make the soundtrack better for you."
3,Play it again and again and again...,"It's a really nice soundtrack selection made by the director, Zach Braff. I think a lot of the songs get you attached once you start to hear them over a few times. The best songs are ""Let Go"" by Frou Frou and ""Such Great Heights"". The rest are okay. The truth is I just got the CD becauase I loved the movie."
3,Worth the $2 + shipping I paid...,"I finally got around to picking up a used copy of this sound track. Liked the movie, liked the mellow feel of the music they picked for it. I mostly love sound tracks because they are a great lazy man's mixed tape.So, if you're not big into music or a music snob but you want a mellow mix to throw in your CD player every once in a while I'd recommend this. For the price of the used copies available, you can't go wrong."
4,"Overall, a pretty good soundtrack.","Overall, I liked this soundtrack although it's nothing amazing. The last four songs I really liked and the rest of the album was okay. Iron and Wine's cover of ""Such Great Heights"" is really good and fits the mood of the movie very well."
5,"""Garden State"" soundtrack is a masterpiece..buy it..I did!","I haven't seen the movie yet but the soundtrack is amazing!! This is the ultimate chill out music, whether for a romantic evening in or a bubble bath. Each song is very emotionally appealing. ""Blue Eyes"" is my favorite song, a dreamy lullaby that I often fall asleep to. (A great slow song!!) Zach Braff amazes me. The best songs are ""Don't Panic"" ""New Slang"" ""Lebanese Blonde"" and ""Blue Eyes."" Really, if you buy the CD for one reason, buy it for ""Blue Eyes."" It's my new favorite song...and I'm 16!! Aren't I supposed to be obsessed with Usher? ""Blue Eyes"" is a universally appealing, beautiful song that reminds me of my darling Jon, who has blue eyes."
1,Where are the missing tracks?,"I love this soundtrack, and it is probably one of the best out there. So why am I giving it one star? When I bought the soundtrack-around the time the movie came out-I got one with 19 tracks, not 13. Where are these other songs now? The missing tracks are some of the best, don't buy this version if you can find the one with more songs, it's MUCH better."
1,something to listen to when trying to sleep!,i fell inlove with the movie so i ordered the sound track thinking it was going to be the same. this cd is very boring and slow!
1,Find your own damn music,"ok, so you faux-indie kids really dig the movie, fine, but quit going around like this is the newest thing you just found that nobody's ever heard of, cause it's getting annoying. yes, this album is full of top-notch acts, but it's also full of the poppiest, best-known acts in the supposed ""indie underground"". If you wanna use this as a jumping-off point to getting into actual good, hard-working, dedicated acts, all the better, but quit telling me how awesome the movie is and how these songs changed your life. i'm not saying you're sheep (that's for god and jesus to say), i'm saying you're fish, and just cause you found a less-known stream, it doesn't mean you've changed directions or destinations."
4,If you like this soundtrack...,"A couple friends pointed me to this soundtrack, apparently anticipating my reaction, which was this:""Looks like a sample from one of our playlists,"" referring to a radio show I host in Fort Worth, Texas.So, of course I'll buy the cd, at least for the few tracks I don't already own.Anyway, if you like this soundtrack, you might want to consider tuning into our show, broadcast live Sunday nights, or just wander around our playlists and maybe find some other worthy songs for your own soundtrack: www.goodshow.netLive streaming audio is available at www.ktcu.tcu.eduThanks."
4,good stuff,an eclectic collection of songs that move well within the film and stand firmly on their own. I'm impressed at the mind that came up with this interesting list.
4,Garden State CD Review,"I am glad I bought this CD. There are 3 or 4 songs I don't like that much (5 thru 7), but the majority of the CD is a very mellow, eclectic set of music that both fits well with the movie and makes for enjoyable listening. For me it is not a killer CD that you must have, but it is a very welcome part of my collection."
4,A Sampler of a Generation,"If one were to ask me about my musical tastes, I would direct them to the Garden State soundtrack, as a sampler of my favorite music. This is no coincidence- this amazing CD has introduced me to multiple artists which I now consider among my favorites- in fact, as a result of this album, I now have an additonal 11 albums of various artists on the CD.There is something about Garden State that allowed it to trancend all boundaries in my high school- everyone listened to that album, no matter what ""click"" (of which there are not many anymore in modern high school) or group they were in. Zach Braff helped introduce these people and millions of others to The Shins and many other amazing artists on this cd. In fact, I myself have gone through phases with many of the artists on the CD- Nick Drake, whose ""One of These Things First"" is a definite highlight of the cd, Simon and Garfunkel and others. A perfect companion to one of the best movies of 2004."
4,Pitch-perfect Soundtrack,"Zach Braff sets himself up as the next generation's Woody Allen, and it's a testimony to his writing/directing skills that his first film is his ""Annie Hall"". ""Garden State"" succeeds both as an often very funny look at his generation (and his parents' generation; i.e., mine) as well as a sweet and realistic love story. And he selected the perfect soundtrack for it: a moody, reflective collection of songs from some of the best alternative and ""chillout"" artists around today (Coldplay, The Shins, Zero 7, Iron and Wine, et al.), as well as classic artists like Simon and Garfunkel and Nick Drake. (Hmm... were Simon and Drake the original ""shoegazers""?) It's a mellow, coherent collection that works very well outside of the context of the film, which will be remembered not only as a ""sleeper"" hit, but also one of the best films of the year."
