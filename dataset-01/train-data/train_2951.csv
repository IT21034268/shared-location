3,fun but hard,this game is very fun it hard to see the cards because there very small and to light in print you always have to have the lite on
5,"Lather, rinse, repeat, woo-hoo!","I have extremely fine hair (like a baby) and am always on the lookout for a shampoo product that:a) I don't have to buy at a salon but could if I wanted to,b) won't cost me an arm and a leg, andc) will make my hair look thick and lusturous without giving it that strange cotton-candy fluff texture that thickening shampoos tend to give.I've finally found it!I can't speak for other hair types, but TIGI Catwalk Thickening Shampoo works like a dream on my own straight baby hair. Also, it has a very fresh, fruity scent reminiscent of apples.You can buy it in Target or other drugstores, but it's usually higher priced (around $12.99, at least in California), so if you're ordering from Amazon anyhow, just drop this in! It's worth every penny."
1,Just a rehashing of Marxist ideas,"This book is just a rehashing of Marxist concepts, applied on an event in Indian history. According to the Marxists ancient Indian was riven with superstition and intellectual squalor, which continued upto to Islamic age. The destruction of Somnath is blamed not on the invaders but on the Hindu society. This book is just an Islamic apology of temple-breaking tradition."
1,Cheap material used to construct the puzzle,"The quality of the puzzle is poor. Puzzle pieces come with the ends frayed; layers of the cardboard came apart. Once put together, I don't think the pieces will survive the process of taking it apart and reassemble again. I regret buying it. It's too late to return it as I realized it will cost me to ship it back. What is the point? Too much hassle. STick with Ravensburger Puzzle instead."
5,This is a awesome single that you can use at home mixing!,"This cd ROCKS COMPLETELY!!! You will love it, and this cd is also made famous for its use during Paul Oakenfold's BBC ESSENTIAL MIX at IBIZA sometime a couple of years ago!! This is a must have if u like other singers and their singles like LASGO and Ian Van Dahl!!"
4,An explosively colorful portrayal of geological phenomenons,"Andrew Robinson does a wonderful job of coupling easy to understand text with explosively colorful visual imagery to create a book that can be enjoyed by either the novice naturalist or the most educated expert. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on earthquakes and volcanoes where he graphically depicts the geophysics behind the natural phenomenon and couples the graphs with brilliant pictures, allowing the reader to visually and geophysically relate to these topics."
4,It Works,"I recently purchased the StarTech.com 6IN 20 TO 24 PIN F/M ATX (ATX2024FM) as I have an older motherboard that will only use a 20-pin power cable from the power supply, and the power cable from my modular power supply is a 24-pin. Once I lined up the pins, it was a snap to install and the computer runs great!"
5,All Wet,"I've had my Aquaracer for just over a year now and I wear it everywhere! Dress up/dress down I always get compliments as its so eye catching and the design simple and clean. It loses about 5 seconds a month and I don't mind at all. I like to set it so the minute hand is exactly where it should be at the 60/0 and 30 second marks, sometimes it could take me 15 minutes to set it right! But once its set it keeps accurate even though it loses those seconds. The bevel is great and I use it to time everything from steaks on the Barbie (5min per side) to how long I'm waiting on line to international time conversion. I traveled a lot this summer and I wore my Aquaracer snorkeling around the cays near Bermuda, off the cape of Trafalgar in Spain, the Mediterranean in the south of France, many pools of various salt and chemical densities and my own shower in Los Angeles!"
4,Weird second hand?,"I got the modelWJ1111BABA0570 today and love the look and feel, very solid. It is the Tag Heuer Link Quartz not the automatic.But the second hand does a weird thing. It stops every four second then advances four seconds all at once. I have many watches, including two other Tags, but I've never seen this. Am I missing something? Has anyone else seen this? Despite this, it does seem to keep excellent time.Should I return it? Or is this some feature that has been added to this watch or present in other watches and I am just unaware. It is a little unsettling, especially when I am taking a patient's pulse."
2,Heat of the Moment,"I'm not sure who categorized this as a BLAZE, but whoever did is falsely advertising what's written. Very tame and not nearly adult enough for the category. Tame Romance at best."
5,One of the world's greatest actors presents the Bible,"The KJV of the Bible needs no endorsement from me. When selecting an audio book you need to evaluate the actor who does the reading, and Roscoe Lee Browne is one of the best actors alive. He also has one of the most beautiful voices in his profession, which makes all his books on tape treats worth seeking out. He isn't as widely known as he deserves to be, but you may recall some of his work. He narrated the film Babe and provided the voice of the Kingpin in the excellent animated Spiderman TV series which recently completed its run. Amazon also sells an audio Old Testament for which Browne recorded Exodus, Jeremiah, Lamentations and Jonah."
5,Clear and Concise,"This book was a tremendous help to me in designing an incentive based pay system for my company. It is extremely clear and concise. I would highly recommend it, especially for the price. I spent far more on another book that promised to do more and failed. Very good buy!"
5,best of the lot,"Since no one book is going to cover everything, I got a bunch, including Diamant's ""The New Jewish Wedding"" and Hawxhurst's ""Interfaith Wedding Ceremonies."" Lerner's was the most helpful by far. I'm a Reformed Jew and my wife is Baptist, and with Lerner's book we were able to create a ceremony that was both beautiful and respectful/traditional to both religions. The book is clear in thought, and offers many different passages/readings to choose from for each part of the service. I guess Diamant's book would've been okay if my wife was going to convert to Judaism, which was never a consideration for either of us, otherwise, it was too orthodox in thought. Stick with Lerner's book -- clearly the best of the lot."
4,Lots of good information!,"This book has given my fiance and I alot of information about how we can set up our wedding ceremony. We are using it as a guide, not as gospel. Good resource!"
5,Comments from an interfaith Rabbi,"I am a Rabbi and have devoted my ministry to serving Jewish/interfaith couples. This book is extremely helpful in explaining, contrasting and combining different elements of several faith traditions into the ceremony."
5,GREAT REFERENCE TOOL,In helping to advise my son on his upcoming wedding this was a very valuable reference book. I learned alot and it was very helpful in making suggestions and putting together a program with all the explanations on the various elements to consider in a Catholic / Jewish ceremony.
5,Helpful for Hardcore bodybuilder!,"I'm a student of China and I've been bodybuilding for almost 8 years.This book is good for Real bodybuilder.it is very informative overall,even drugs! Recently,I am writing a file about ""Spill over Effect"".The concept is from this book.So,If youlike bodybuilding very very much,you must buy this book!"
4,A nice enough bag,"Well, the bag is a tad smallish (is that a real word?), but a good enough size when traveling light. I thought the use of Velcro for the flap closure was a tad elementary school, but I'm learning to like it. So, in short, a bag that ensures you won't pack too much and it is certainly sturdy, given the price.Although I would have to agree that the shipping charge was a tad extreme. That's the only thing that is keeping it from a 5 star rating, really. Yikes! We may not have an internet sales tax yet, but somebody's making a mint off these shipping and handling fees..."
5,Doan's Pills have Aspirin Product and Diphenhydramine,"Doan's Pills have been on the market for low back pain for years. It's main active ingredient is an aspirin derivative, but this formulation adds Diphenhydramine to aid in sleep. Diphenhydraime is the active ingredient in Benadryl. Diphenhydramine is a medication used to treat allergies, but it has one major side effect, that of causing sleepiness. Therefore when you take this product you are actually taking an allergy pill, however, it will work to help you sleep too.The only draw-back to this product is that it gives a mild hang-over effect the morning after. I found that the effects last about 12 hours, so take it about an hour before bedtime and it cuts off an hour of sluggishness the following morning.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig"
1,Total Waste of Time,This CD is a total waste of time and money. The songs are stupid and childish but it isn't for kids because the dialog is about a man trying to hook up with a woman. We are going to Paris for our honeymoon and don't know a word of french so I was looking for something for beginners. Listening to a man talk about going on a date with a french women and then a french woman singing a song about it did not teach me french. I hope I can get my money back.
2,No point in reading,"This book shows the struggles and hardships of an Indian girl named Walks Alone.Her father died when she was about 2. The White Eyes attack her tribe and kill her mother. Later in the story Walks Alone's brother, Sleeps In A Bush, dies too. How Sad! Walks Alone spends the entire time working to get back home to her family, and in the end she doesn't get what wants. :(The ending to this book is super sad and pointless. The novel tells you about life back then, but the storyline is awful."
5,Good historical fiction,Not much is written about the warm Spring Apache Native Americans. This is a start. A good read for young adults and up.
3,A Pain,"This book is really not worth getting, unless you liked sad endings. It is very descriptive though and you can learn a lot from this book aout the struggles the main character faces. Yet, I wouldn't waste the time reading this book, again."
5,fabulous tea,"This is a truly excellent jasmine green tea. Tired of having trouble finding it at the store, or fighting with other customers to get the last box when it was on sale (that did happen to me once), I was thrilled to find the product on Amazon - and better yet, to get it shipped to me periodically with no additional effort on my part. Great product, great way to get it."
4,James Last Trumpet a Go Go,"I bought this for my father but was disappointed as, although classified 'as new', one track would not work. I have contacted the seller last week but am unaware of a reply as yet."
2,"A Glossary, not a Guide","This book is organized alphabetically, by parliamentary phrase. If you are new to parliamentary procedure, or unfamiliar with correct parliamentary jargon, this will not be of much help.Supposedly, this organizing style will help the user during a meeting to quickly locate relevent material, but by breaking up procedure, the reader will actually be pointed to several 'see also' topics in different parts of the book.Riddick may be offering a better procedural model, but it is entirely up to the reader to piece the model into a unified structure."
2,Not the greatest for airline travel,"I recently took a trip and wanted to see how much of the airplane's engine noise these headphones would cancel. I was fairly disappointed as the difference was noticable, but not very significant. While these are very light which was nice, I would have rather have had the extra weight and had these be over-the-ear headphones which would probably have helped block out some of the engine noise and made the noise-cancelling seem more effective. I ended up using the over-the-ear headphones I had brought along just in case."
2,Uncomfortable and not much in the way of Noise Cancellation,"I was very disappointed with the Koss QZ50. They do not fit on the head very well, and the noise cancellation is very slight. The sound quality is good, but not exceptional. I would suggest looking for another option."
1,Didn't even work and it doesn't look good either!!,"When I recieved my order I was so excited but when I opened it, i was so disappointed!! The eairpieces of it are over 1 and a half inches thick, I looked like a robot wearing them! When I put the battery into them, they weren't lightweight, they kept falling off my ears when I walked! Plus, get this, they didn't even work, when i tried to turn on the noise canceling function, the red light didn't even turn on!! These would be great if you're looking for a geeky looking pair of stereophones! Good luck, if you them!"
1,Don't buy,This ankle bracelet was rather flimsy and too stretched out. I thought it was going to fall off of my ankle!
4,shenadojoe,Knife is sharp although I wish the tip came to a point rather than being rounded. It will be interesting to see how long it remains sharp.
4,One thing missing,"This knife has to be the sharpest knife I have ever used. Effortlessly cuts. Really nice. The only issue is that it does not come with a sheath as many I have seen do. It is too sharp to leave in the drawer, and I would be wary of damaging the blade as well. I don't use a block due to limited counter space. A protective sheath would be perfect."
5,Ceramic Knives are Da Bomb,"I was very skeptical of ceramic knives, but after using this one, I'm a convert. Light, ergonomic, very sharp, uses less effort than a regular knife, easy to clean. I have not yet dropped it or chipped it yet.I am going to buy more of these!"
5,AMAZINGLY SHARP,I purchased this knife after seeing how there were made on the tv show hod it's made. It is amazingly sharp.One thing that it excels at is removing the skin from a fish filet. Even on species like tile fish which are not usually eaten due to thedifficulty of removing the almost leather like skin this knife does the job easily. As for vegetables it does a great job .
5,A great knife from a respected manufacturer.,"There are a lot of ceramic knives out there at many different price points. I bought two Kyocera 5 1/4 inch slicing knives as gifts this Christmas because I received one as a gift myself last Christmas. The sharpness of the blade cannot be denied nor can the guarantee. I like the ergonomic handle, even when my hands are wet."
4,Nice size,"This is one of only two ceramic knives that I have purchased. This size is particularly useful, not too long, not too short, and it just glides through meat and veggies. Very light weight. Not good for chopping or slicing through big blocks of hard cheese."
4,Valuable Insights into a Venerable Institution,"Valuable insights into the founding, evolution, and character of one of America's most influential art schools are provided by this book.The author goes ""behind the scenes"" to provide us with a human view of the instructors and students and their relationship to the League. It discusses the League's disputatious beginnings and its energetic evolution into what is arguably New York's most important art school.The author has used his art-world connections to glean rare anecdotes about the League, offering the reader glimpses of this institution which are unlikely to be found elsewhere.This book will be valuable to anyone who wishes to understand the history of art and artists in New York."
1,Not very good for self study.,"I had purchased this book based on all of the positive reviews from this website and others. However, I was not at all happy with the result. The book itself does not explain anything. It makes learning a chore and kills every ounce of motivation to learn math. My two recently purchased Calculus books (Calculus Made Easy and A First Course in Calculus) made the subject fun and motivating. Everything was explained thoroughly and the solutions were given unlike this Trigonometry book.Simply put - no solutions, no explanations, and no motivation to learn. It is not a good book for anyone wishing to self learn Trigonometry.Good luck with your purchases!"
2,Huge Disappointment!!,"I usually buy books that have good feedback because it has served me well in the past, but unfortunately this isn't the case with this book. The author couldn't have picked a more perplexing way to explain this subject. Yes it's filled with problems, but what good are the problems if you don't have the correct answer nor do you have an explanation on how to solve them. Don't let the wonderful reviews fool you. If you still think it's worth a try, then I advise for you to look at a copy before buying."
4,Fun reading on a serious note,"Gannon's book is an easier read than most other comparative culture texts. Through the use of metaphors, he provides useful insight into the main cultural groups distinguished throughout the world today. However, his choice of metaphors and often his own personal views present only a limited view of each area and fail to compare across regions."
1,stereotypes galore,"This reviewer has lived and worked in five countries and can tell you that the book is not helpful to understand them. Five is a fair sample, so knowing that the chapters on Belgium, Germany, the UK, Spain and France are a collection of stereotypes, one has to wonder how accurate the book may be when it comes to countries in Asia. Asians - don't rely on this book to understand Europe. Fellow europeans, beware. Americans, buy this book at your own risk. Africans and Australians, don't bother."
1,Misleading advertisement,I was disappointed with the order. I thought that I was getting the lotion with the brown top but I received the lotion with the green top which is NOT the product that I wanted. I will not be ordering from the company in the future.
4,"It's very soothing, and it has a nice ...","It's very soothing, and it has a nice feel once you put it on. The bottle has a nice applicator. I like a clear container, so you can easily see how much is left. It moisturizes the skin very well, too. It feels a little oily, but not too bad. No unpleasant odor."
4,This after-sun lotion is wonderful. I can't wait ...,"This after-sun lotion is wonderful. I can't wait to try it out in the summer sun. I go tanning about three to four times a week, and have started to apply the lotion after I get done. It leaves my skin smooth and moist. No dry-skin patches in sight anywhere. Not only that, but it smells great too. I'm going to be packing this stuff in my beach bag this year!"
3,Wait for a REAL compilation.,"So, what do we have? 12 good songs from 3 good albums. Are they the best songs? Maybe, maybe not. Here's the bottom line. For about the same price as this 1 cd, you could go get ""Smell the magic"", ""Bricks are heavy"", ""Hungry for stink"", and ""The Beauty process..."". Especially used. If you quickly need a 1 disc L7 fix that's not 40 bucks, I suggest ""Hungry for Stink"". It rocks!"
1,Battery issues,"The product information is WRONG. The Vivicam 3935 takes 2 AA-size alkaline or NiMH batteries, but this model, the 3930, takes an odd Li-ion battery that Vivitar themselves do not sell! The only option for battery replacement is an expensive Duracell non-rechargeable model."
3,Battery issue?,I don't have this camera but-One reviewer complained that he couldn't find rechargable batteries for this camera. But the product information says it takes 2 AA NIMH batteries which are the most commonly available rechargable batteries there are. So one or the other is wrong.
2,Had bad experience with 3615 model,"I bought a Vivicam 3615 last year. The camera worked fine for about 6 months, then the picture quality degraded significantly.The colors are all a bit ""off"" now and it takes poor quality images at night.Experience with Vivitar tech support was very frustrating."
5,KinniToos,"Excellent replacement for an Oreo if you're on a gluten/casein free diet. Texture's great, tastes almost the same - maybe not quite as rich. My son LOVES them."
5,Great Cookies for Allergies,"This product is great for twins that have allergies to eggs, wheat, soy, and milk products. One of the best cookies out there. Would highly recommend."
5,"Good for kids, good for moms!","I love these cookies and so does my 2-year-old son. We both have gluten and dairy sensitivities and these allow us to have a pre-made cookie snack. Try the chocolate ones too, they are yummy too!"
1,worst cookies ever,a friend bought be these cookies to cheer me up one day. I had to spit them out! they are yucky!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Nope, they're gross",I couldn't stand them. I'm hoping to find a better tasting sandwich cream cookie. 'Cus these are so very gross.
1,My kids wouldn't even eat them...,"My children are NOT picky eaters, especially my 2-year-old son. Hey, it's a cookie after all. Even though Mommy's trying to clean out their systems, they earned a special treat. Well, one bite and that was it, they weren't buying it for one minute. Sadly I spent too much on a less-than-satisfactory product. Maybe it was the grainy texture, although they'll eat my homemade gluten-free cookies, which I'd consider grainy. The obvious after taste was my biggest issue. Blech! We'll pass on these thanks!"
2,Got sick,Extremely similar to Oreo's but the fiber content makes you extremely dehydrated and I suffered some issues for a while because I was eating too many.That being I can't say too many good things about them for this reason and the fact I could have been in the hospital. If you are old or suffer some issues with hydration I advice another snack.
2,Glutino's Version Is Better,"Don't get me wrong, I ate the entire package just fine (2.5 days), but compared to Glutinos 'oreo', this one isn't as good. Look for Glutinos instead. They are the same price in the store."
2,Almost as good as Oreos? Not quite...,"I was really excited to try these cookies because I really love Oreos. After reading rave reviews, I went out and got a package of them from Whole Foods. Maybe it's the fact that I have just recently been diagnosed as Celiac (1 month ago) and the amazing taste of real Oreos is fresh in my mind, but these just don't do it for me. They taste nothing like real Oreos and probably have more in common with a Hydrox cookie. If you are on a GF diet, you can eat these and pretend they are Oreos, but you have to have a strong imagination, because they leave a LOT to be desired. I'd much rather do without (or make some home-made GF oreo cookies)."
5,Great Taste!,I purchased these from Whole Foods for my friend as a gift. She has Celiac's (sp) and always talks about how crappy gluten free treats are. I gave her a box and she LOVED them. I even ate one and I honestly could not tell the difference between an Oreo and Ktoo.I recommend these cookies and Amazon is cheaper than Whole Foods.
5,Great GFCF alternative for kids!,"These are the best gluten free, casein free sandwich cookies we have tried! Nice flavor, and the texture is decent, too. My daughter loves them. They don't have the nasty after taste or flavor that other GFCF cookies sometimes have. We will be buying these again - that's for sure!"
5,Better than Oreos,"Having tried many gluten-and wheat-free cookies, these are best I've had. The cookies are crisp and the insides are just like the original Oreo cookies. They don't have the problem of some gluten free snacks with textures that are weird and soft or hard and dry. Of course they're fattening just like the wheat-based stuff. Eat in moderation."
4,Bonus track selection could have been better....,"Great to have this album reissued, and to finally include Wild Life on it, but it's hard to believe they missed the opportunity to include 12"" versions and opted for 7"" versions instead! It would have been great to have the 12"" versions of Cruel Summer, Robert DeNiro's Waiting, and the full version of State I'm In from the b-side of the ""hot line to heaven"" single. All of the reissues of Bananarama's catalog make it clear that fans hunger for bonus tracks, but there are still so many mixes of their songs that have failed to make it to CD at last."
5,Brings back memories,I had this on a tape and finally got in on CD -I love listening to Cruel Summer when the wether is nice
2,Medallion Quilts,I was very disappointed in this book in that it is basically in black and white with no color It detracts fromn the overall enjoyment although it still gives a lot of good ideas
1,Can't break the initial code to use this game,"To begin the game, there is a code that must be broken. There is no help system or hint to tell you what it could be. Perhaps you must know it from the movie? Neither I nor my son could break the code. Therefore, he could not play the game. Worthless."
3,Great strobe and continuous lighting,This is a great light. Very strong. Using this most of the time with an umbrella.
3,I feel like I was in Jr. high again,"This DVD brought back some very good memories. I thought for its time the music and videos stood out. For me the music is still the best part of it all. The only sad thing is when you look at it, you have to wonder how huge they would have been had they just stayed together."
3,"ASIA TEN STARS, BUT THIS DVD ONLY THREE!","The poeple who makes this DVD doesn't know about ASIA. The GO video (from ASTRA album) isn't included in this DVD. You have only 5 of the 6 studio videos that ASIA makes in the Wetton era. The title must be ""ASIA: THE INCOMPLETE DVD COLLECTION"". Why this important video is missing? Only the stupid person of Geffen records who makes this video knows the answer..."
3,good but too expensive,"these are cute little things but kind of small and don't do much for the pretty steep price of 30 bucks! my 4-month old does like them but they don't really keep her entertained for long. my money was better spent on the manhattan toy car seat gallery (poster with switchable cards on hang on backseat: $10), which has lots of pictures she loves to stare while riding in the car."
4,Not that perfect,"They are ok but they should be a little bit longer!! My baby is very interested in things around him and he would love touching them and grabbing them but he can NOT reach them!!! Otherwise, good, colorful product and the clips are useful for when you have a baby sheet over the car seat"
3,The Original Version is better,"I love this song from a songwriting point of view, but I am not crazy about this version. Even though I am not a big Rod Stewart fan, I think that his version is better. This song plays better as a pop tune and not a country tune. It is a fantastic song about hope and encouragement, but if you're a fan of pop music, you will definitely like Rod's version better. I think Diane Warren is a great songwriter and this version doesn't do her work justice. Listen to the Rod Stewart version. I bet you'll agree it's better."
4,Good Tattoo background information,Somehow missed that this was really not cuts from various tattoos and tattoo like tournaments so there really isn't a lot of full military music. However it was good background info that I enjoyed learning. Trouble is that you might watch this once or twice to understand the event but then its bascially retired or re-gifted.
4,Excellent book on resolving conflict!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book with my pre-schooler. I liked how the author gives us two characters who have a lot of differences, yet are such good friends. The names of the main characters also goes beyond what we might typically think of as boy or girl likes and dislikes. For example, the boy's name is Pinky because he likes the color pink, and the girl's name is Rex because that's her favorite dinosaur. The thing I enjoyed most about this book though was that towards the end they come across a problem where only one dinosaur is left to purchase from the museum gift shop. I really liked how these children learned to resolve the problem on their own and did so creatively! What a wonderful lesson for children to learn!"
1,The Homecomming,I cannot purchase this book on my Kindle --- THE LAST BOOK IN THE SERIES and I CAN'T READ IT!!!!! NOT FAIR!
3,Great for collectors of Agnetha Faltskog memorabilia,"I am a loyal fan of ABBA and particularly of Agnetha. ""As I Am"" was an excellent source of pictures for me as a fan. I do not, however, understand why this book was billed as a ""No holds barred"" account of her life with ABBA. I expected a lot more in depth information about Agnetha as a person, daughter, wife, mother, performer, etc. One question: Why was her sister never mentioned again after the picture on page 18????? I enjoyed reading this book as a fan and it is a great addition to my collection, but I would love to know more."
3,"Great for fans or the curious, but otherwise rather mild","Reportedly written in response to negative and innaccurate rumors surrounding her life during and after ABBA, blonde singer Agnetha Faltskog offers her take on her life and career. As a diehard ABBA fan, it's interesting to read her side of the story, but if you're looking for scandal or shocking revelations, look elsewhere. It's all pretty mild, although the last two chapters work best at getting to the heart of a woman who feels mistreated by the press over the past 25 years. Chock full of pictures, it's best for fans."
3,Would have been nice to have learned something,"It was actually too good to be true that one of the Abba members was coming forth in an autobiography. There is nothing here that couldn't be gleaned (in terms of both pictures and text) from the liner notes in the Greatest Hits Vol.2 album. The book is maddeningly aloof and there is nothing new about the band. Maybe Bjorn and Benny will write one, detailing how they wrote all those great songs. That really would be too good to be true."
2,True Abba story yet to be told,"Although a fabulously presented book full of wonderful photos it really fails to deliver as an autobiographical. I kept turning the pages with the hope of reading something really interesting but it just didnt happen, its as if the author has deliberately gone out of her way to protect her subject. As Agnetha herself states in the book that she would not reveal anything of her marriage breakups (its not this were really interested in) she fails to even offer a sliver of information regarding the trials and tribulations of being part of a history making pop group, save a few comments about the 1979 tour being ""terrible for me"" and how the media have been unkind to her over recent years comparing her to the great Garbo for her wanting to live in some sort of peace and quiet away from all the buzz. As I have said, wonderfully lavish presentation but should only appeal to the diehard ABBA fan."
2,Not much revelation here...,"This book is a disappointment. It is not really an ""autobiography"" but just minimal anecdotes about fame, life on the road, etc. etc. The type is very large and it can be read in one sitting. The photos are nice, but they are all tour photos and professionally done portraits with the exception of a few childhood photos. Overall, a nicely designed book but I didn't really know anything more about Agnetha Faltskog from what I had previously read in interviews and magazine articles."
2,Oh dear: what a boring life,"This book could only possibly appeal to diehard ABBA fans who still want to know what made Annifrid, Benny, Bjorn and Agnetha tick. At the very least there should be some explanation for the costumes. But what Agnetha has dished is the least revealing autobiography in living memory. She retraces events familiar to any self respecting fan and ignores questions of personality, musical preference...well, just about everything that makes one want to read someone else's story. I read the book in one sitting (very easy) and haven't touched it since, despite there being some excellent photos of her and the rest of the group. If you'd like something at least a little racy I'd recommend the (probably mostly fictional) biography ""The Name Of The Game"", but as for ""As I Am"" best get on with your (probably more interesting) life."
3,she could've more...,"I am an ABBA/Agnetha fan. She may come out with sheer garbage and I will still go out and get it. But since I still care about the $20.00 i blew on this, this is my 10 cents worth: the translations are to be kind about it at some portions in the book,faulty (ie:""survive with our lives intact [?]) I certainly respect her decision not to touch on those that, in her own words, would cause any hurt to anyone but she at least could've made up for that by telling us about how it was like working for the producers of her two other solo albums:Eric Stewart (of 10cc) and Peter Cetera (formerly of Chicago).At least, I am thankful to know that Agnetha and Frida didn't hate each other.As far as setting the record straight is concerned, I think she still could've said more."
3,A glimpse inside of Agnetha,"I didn't know much gossip about ABBA before I read this book, and having read it, I certainly know more than I did, mainly about the career and inside world of Agnetha as a performer. But as an average reader and former fan of ABBA I would have liked to know more about her personal life, and about her as a person, not as a performer. Although some people have commented in these reviews that there are wonderful photos, what I was really hoping to see was pictures of her with her family, her children, her parents, and her sister, and what they really thought about her as a daughter, a mother, and a sister. All the pictures show her as a part of ABBA onstage or in her professional life, except for one very blurry and old picture of her as a little girl with her parents and her baby sister. I expected more interesting pictures, especially of her children."
2,Is there less to Agnetha than meets the eye?,"There's a fascinating story in the saga of Abba, but the beautiful, warm, seductive and gloriously voiced Agnetha isn't telling it, for some reason. Though some of the photos are very enjoyable (Agnetha, you've aged more than gracefully), the book itself is aggravatingly superficial. I felt cheated, frankly. Perhaps Frida can step to the plate and tell the real story - not about the love affairs (as I agree with Agnetha that it's none of our business), but about the music and the business behind the scenes. Brilliant music - astonishing success - truly great live act - how did it all happen? What was it like? C'mon Frida, give it a go....."
3,Come back to us!,"Listen but once please to me, girl. When I was a punk in the mass company of punkhoodship in the seventies, no-one dared like you, because it would have been social suicide!Today, all those punks - YES! AND ME! - love you and your music to bits. I challenge YOU, AGNETHA - to listen to any daytime English (yeah, 'popular') radio station and NOT find it at least refreshing to listen to those great ABBA songs again. Just for one song, pretend it isn't you and appreciate the plaintiff gutsy calls of those two girls - never dated; maybe never will. Then compare it for a moment to the slack, indifferent, monotone garbage of today? Please don't get ten years down the line and decide I was right! You're gorgeous! Come back to us?Tom Hathaway (author, 'FULL BACON JACKET') XXXXXXXXXXX"
4,Great book for getting started with Red Hat 8.0,"Red Hat 8.0 is a very good first attempt at the desktop OS market by Red Hat. This book looks like a collection of some of the excellent documentation from Red Hats web site. It covers basic installation and use well. For more advanced use you will have to look elsewhere(It couldn't tell me how to setup power management on my laptop). The book concentrates heavily on using Gnome, but has an appendix on using KDE. The section on using the command line interface (CLI) is a good introduction for beginners. I would recommend this book for someone who was interested in trying Red Hat Linux. Then after gaining some experience they could move to a more advanced Linux/Unix book. This book and CD set is a great deal if you are not able to download the CD image and documentation from Red Hat, or if you prefer printed manuals."
5,muchacho solitario,"Hola chicos mi nombre es Jeilyn Davila Soler de puerto Rico. Quiero felicitarlos por su nuevo albun,exelente me encantan todas las canciones y creo que es un buen trabajo el haber grabado las canciones con Ricardo Montaner ya que es un exelente cantante,los quiero felicitar nuevamente por el gran esfuerzo que estan realizando, que Dios siempre los acompane, y los protejaCon carino su fan enamorada JEILIN DAVILA SOLER"
5,I'ts the best CD ever made,"This CD is the second official CD of the primera brothers, they are comming back stronger, and with a much more mature sound to theire music. I recomend this CD to people who like pop and Salsa music, and to people who want to listen to the two Sweetest voices ever. In this CD Servando wrote a couple of songs, and there is also a song featuring Ricardo Montaner."
5,very helpful entry level textbook for cold atoms,"This book is worthy of its reputation.It is an easy read, is quite comprehensive, has the right balance of theory and experiment, and gets you started on the subject of cold atoms without much fuss or pretense. Nice collection of figures and references too. Note that the style is not ""many-body"" or Green function based, and emphasizes topic more than technique - so a condensed matter theorist getting into cold atoms should use some traditional many body text to accompany this. The field of cold atoms is getting increasingly integrated with condensed matter these days, and a suitably contemporary and unified book is yet to be written.Given that the rapid pace in which the subject of cold atoms is developing, new edition with additional material - especially on optical lattices and dipolar quantum gases, may be a good idea."
4,A fascinating book with a fascinating form.,"Reading Ginsberg's journals, one might wonder why he even bothered to make conventional page poetry. Here, his ""first thought - best thought"" advice is best seen in action. Dreams, questions, drafts, snippets of verse, travelogue, close observation and a bit of gossip mix together to create an organic thing, a real piece of Allen. A fascinating book with a fascinating form."
3,Nice little system,"These speakers produce fairly good sound despite their size. I would have preferred to have a volume switch on the speaker inself instead of having to use the ipod click wheel. Also, the ipods do not fit securely. They basically are held in place by only two small plastic pieces on the back and by the sides of the speakers themselves. They can easily fall out. Other than that, they are pretty good."
1,Ashkenazy - Chopin Ballades & Scherzi,"Music was glorious, but too much was packed on the disk (more than 700 MB). The last track would not play on any CD player or computer I tried it on, and efforts to import the last track would cause the computer to hang."
3,"Hasbro, decided to be cheap.","Yes, its very hard to transform blah blah blah, that's not what pissed me off about this product. This transformer's paint is not durable at all, this can become a problem while transforming it. The parts dont stay together very well at all, the plastic is flimsy. If you want to buy an alternator, I wouldn't recommend them, I would only recommend Bintaltech transformers. Binaltech are the Japanese version of the Alternators, BUT MUCH BETTER QUALITY"
4,Of course its not for kids!,"Okay.....one of the reviewers here mentioned that you need an engineering degree to transform this guy. And that may very well be right. But for everyone to get riled up and fit to be tied because their kids can't transform this thing is just plain dumb. Anyone who looks at the alt mode can see it involves a complicated transformation. And yes its Hasbro's fault for labeling these things ages 6+.Now for some comments on the toy itself. This is a great version of Wheeljack, the Ford Mustang GT modeling fits him very well as it seems we don't get a lot of G1 looking Transformers these days. As with most Alternators and Binaltechs, the head is very reminiscent of the original Wheeljack. I also really like his sword, its like he's holding a lightsaber or something.Final Conclusion: Its certainly worth it, though if the Binaltech version can be found that would be a better way to go. But I highly recommend this guy."
3,More of a posable figure than a toy.,"This is a great buy for those folks that grew up with the Transformers, but this is a terrable buy for parents looking for a toy for thier children.This character looks great in either vehicle or robot mode, the problem is getting it there. Its very difficult to ""transform"" Wheeljack into his robot mode, and changing him back into a car is a huge pain in the but. Expect the doors to detatch as you transform him. If you expect to be playing with this toy for some time, think about getting the metal Japanese version.As a display piece, he stands well, and his limbs articulate well for posing. The sword that comes with him seems out of place. If someone out there is feeling industrious, you may entertain the idea of creating a weapon for Wheeljack that fits his personality and role more appropriately. Maybe a large combination wrench that he can hold and attaches to him in vehicle mode the same way the sword does."
4,My Review!,"Sharon M. Draper did it agian with her outstanding work. Forged By Fire, a sequel to Tears of a Tiger. Sharon uses the same technique, wonderful. I competely understand when she talks about how Gerald is abandoned and abused. This book really changed my way of thought about abuse and sorrow. I highly recommend this book to young teens who feel as though they have connection with this sort of situation."
4,Forged by Fire was entertaining and all teens should read it,"Fire and desire is what it took for Gerald to overcome his obstacles. Forged by Fire relates to young teens through its dramatic events. It contains realistic events that deal with present problems like child abuse, substance abuse, and death. It is the companion novel to Draper's award winning novel, Tears of a Tiger."
4,Never give up!,"I liked this book because its main character, Gerald, fights for what is right and does not give up. He faces more problems than most kids his age, yet he stands up to his abusive stepdad to save his sister, his mother, and himself. You want to see Gerald succeed and just when it seems he might, something else terrible happens and he had to fight all over again. In that regard, it is a lot like the story of Job in the Bible, who never lost faith either. I know some readers say that too many bad things happen to Gerald for the story to be believable, but I think the author was trying to show that no matter how life beats you down, the strong do survive no matter what, as long as they keep believing in what they're fighting for. I also just finished An Audience for Einstein, another book about good against evil. It's science fiction but is another great story about doing what's right even though that might be very hard."
5,The Fire in This Book Sure is Hot!,"Wow! I don't know what to say. It just goes to show compassion is the thing that keeps you going. And compassion is because of the people who suffer. Monique (Gerald's mom) needed compassion. Or maybe just help.At 3 years old, Gerald has been seperated from his crazy mother. As he turns 10, he is reunitied with her. He has to live with her. and her new husband and his skeleton daughter. Angel was suffering and needed compassion. But it was different from the kind of suffering Monique had. She couldn't help it. She had no adult to tell. But maybe Gerald can save her from this fate."
1,Really!,"My daughter is in 7th grade and was reading this as an assignment. After some conversations about the book, I decided to read it. Basically I found it a very difficult read. I do not enjoy reading about child abuse, neglect and molestation. I can not understand why a teacher would have 12 and 13 year olds reading this. We complain about sex and violence on television and movies, what about in the classroom. Hated it... especially the parts of the story where the young girl is being molested. :("
4,A feel-good story inside a not-so-feel-good story,"This is a good read. It has something for everyone. There is a story to make you feel good with a teenage boy who is lovingly protective of his half-sister for the person who likes happy stories. For the person who like ""overcome all obstacles"" stories, there is a story about a girl who survives her father's continuous sexual abuse and her mother's unimaginable apathy with only her half-brother to help her. This is one Coretta Scott King Award-winning book that, in the literary sense, deserves the accolade it received. Good for all people of all races."
4,Forged By Fire,I thought this book was one of the best novels i have ever read. i really liked this book because its a based on a true story book and those are my favorite kind. i also like it because gerals is a very brave boy in the story and he goes through alot with his evil stepfather.
3,A Good Book,"When I first started the book I didn't think I would like it. I don't usualy like reading books. but this book really caught my eye. By the time i got to the tenth page, I was almost done with the book. The book is very good. At the end of a chapter it doesn't really end it just ties into the next chapter. It always keeps you wanting to keep reading even if you have to put it down. It's a good book."
5,Outstanding book!,"I think this was a great book because it shows how people can make it through all the pain and still manage to survive.Even though Gerald and Angel went through pain,they always had each other to come home to."
5,Tobi's hot new review of Forged By Fire,"I really enjoyed the book Forged By Fire. I feel that the book had a certain ""hold"" on my imagination. This book tells about domestic violence and how it can effect a younger person for the rest of his/ her life.During this book I learned that there are people in the world who face much greater challenges than I do each day. The book Forged By Fire also shows how thankful that you should be to have a loving family that cares about you.i think that this is wonderful and outstanding book. I highly reccomend this book to anyone from ten yrs. old - twenty yrs. old."
1,meh...........ok,"I dont think it was that great. I have read ALOT better. I mean, It was written well, I like how it gave a cirtin amount of class to the urban life, but all in all it was mediocre at best. Most people who wrote a review said something to the effect of"" It was great,couldnt stop reading it!"" well for me, I think that if I didnt have to read it for my reading grade, i never would have gotten past the first chapter. the whole concept of bang bang bang bad stuff happens. I found myself thinking through the whole book ""who cares?"" I wish I hadnt had to have wasted my time. It was just unrealistic"
1,A Book With No Main Focus,"Hi, I read this book for a library thing, and I thought is was pretty pointless. I don't know if the other people that wrote these reviews read the same book that I did....There was totally no point to this book, and first it was about his mom, then his Aunt, then his sister, then basketball, then he loses a friend, but it didn't really tie together. For me it was sort of a waste of time."
2,Nothing special to me...,"I had to read this for class and I personally didn't like it. Basically Gerald's mother abandons him and Gerald lives with Aunt Queen. On one of his birthdays Gerald's mother comes back saying that she and Jordan (her husband) want him to come live with them and that he has a sister, Angel. Aunt Queen dies and so Gerald has to live with his mother and Jordan. Jordan beats Gerald and Angel. Gerald is Angel's savior so to speak and protects her from Jordan whenever he can. You later find out that Jordan molests Angel... Monique (the mother) is in denial about how Jordan treats Gerald and Angel. All Angel and Gerald really have is each other. Other people in my class loved this book, but I really didn't see anything great about it."
3,..,"I liked the book, Forged by Fire, because its exciting and real. I think its exciting and intresting how Gerald deals with Jordan. I like how this book is real. The characters go through real problems and solve them real ways. I think it was a good idea for Gerald to tell his friends father and to have Jordan sent away. I also like how protective Gerald is of his younger sister,Angel. This is why I like the book, Forged by Fire."
5,best fm transmitter i've ever used,All the guys where I work have these other transmitters that have a lot of static. The FM cup by far it the best one I've heard so far.
4,The best one I've had yet,I'm on my third I Pod tramsmitter and have spent a good deal of $ on the first 2. They were pretty much garbage. I purchased this one for a road trip out west and it consistantly worked very well.. Above expectations
4,Good product,"I purchased this so that I could share my audio-books on road trips. It works very well for that. I purchased some children's audio books which the kids love as well. Overall I would say the product works well; if you are looking for very high quality sound for music listening, I am not sure that this would be the best option."
3,Worked great... then it died,"I would have given it five stars for the first four months I had it. The sound was great, and the controls very easy. Then it died, for no apparent reason. Minus two stars."
2,Signal too weak for rear window antenna,"I drive a Subaru with the antenna embedded in the back window and the signal was not strong enough from up front in the cupholder between the seats. Couldn't find a station that wasn't staticky. The cup holder sits kinda low between the seats and if I held it up it got better so it seems this thing does work, just not in my car. If the cupholder were up in the dash and the antenna on the roof, it may work well enough. Liked the design and it was very easy to figure out and use."
2,Piece of junk...,"I bought this because my trusty Kensington finally broke after 6 years. I liked the cup holder concept and thought it would be neat in the car. Unfortunately, every station I tried was lots of static and it sounded terrible. The 3rd time I plugged it into the 12v outlet it broke. I blew 12v fuse in my car digging out the broken pieces of the plug out of the outlet... Very cheaply made. I gave it 2 stars because the cup holder concept is a good one. Too bad the rest of it is a piece of crap."
2,Couldnt get a clear signal for the life of me,"The concept of this thing is great- I wished it worked like it said it did for me. Im in southern california & couldnt get a clear signal no matter where I drove. Very frustrating, so I returned it."
4,Better than any of the other transmitters,"This FM transmitter is much better than the Itrips. It's easy to change the channels, and there's no need to fuss with programming stations into the Ipod. You just plug it in and go. The only trouble with the device is that it must be plugged into the cigarette lighter to function, so you can't use the power source to do anything else without a splitter."
2,Lots of static and poor sound quality,"The only reason I did not return this item is because when I travel to more rural areas, it gives me music options other than bluegrass and gospel. It is very difficult to find a clear FM station that doesn't have a lot of static that plays through the tracks on the ipod. You cannot turn the music up very loud either. I would suggest exploring available FM stations in your area before purchasing this."
2,Macally iPod Transmiter,My expectations were pretty low for sound quality but this was just unusable. It could be because of the glut of radio stations in Metro Detroit. It might work better in more rural areas. But I couldn't understand any of the words on an audio book I was trying to listen to. Listening to music would have even more agrivating. The seller however was superb. I got the product in 2 days and the return was completely hassle free. Kudos to J&R Music World.
1,stopped working,"I enjoyed this product... for the few months that it worked. After about 3 months of having it, it just stopped. Not worth the money."
1,Worked OK for around 2 months,Sound quality was ok at best. My antenna is on the rear of my car (VW).The unit quit working at around 2 months old. I think other users have posted this as well...
2,"interesting design, poor performance","It simply did not work well in any of three vehicles I tried it in. Stations that work with other transmitters locally were staticy and could not be tuned away. The design looks neat, and it probably works well with one of the older nano's but my touch and my wifes 5th gen nano seemed very insecure in the dock. Unless I got a bum unit its probably not worth the buy, but it looks neat. I returned the unit to Amazon. The Griffin 4045 seems to work the best of the ones I have tried so far, probably a better bet"
1,Worthless,The cup seemed like a really good idea. But after using it for about a month I realised I hated it. The sound quality is horrible and the claim about charging your mac device is a joke.
3,"Macally Docking, charging, and Transmitter for Ipod","Works well with the Ipod. The design is very user friendly and just great overall. The only thing is, you must read the directions before you use it, or it will take you a little time before you figure it out. Other then that, I recommended it to who wants a good FM transmitter for the car."
3,Somewhat frustrating!,"Although this product works fine when a perfectly clear channel is found, it doesn't ever last long. Seems like you're always needing to find a new, clear station. I thought it would be nice to listen to my ipod in the car but it ends up being more frustrating and annoying than anything. Haven't tried other products so I can't provide any direct comparisons..."
1,FM signal received is similar to a very weak station,"Although the product works, it is entirely unsatisfactory since the signal received by the FM radio is similar to that of a very weak FM station, with a lot of hiss. I tried it on two different frequencies (92.1, 100.1) with no difference in sound quality. I was extremely disappointed."
1,worked well for 2 weeks,"I've had other transmitters that didn't work as well as this, however after 2 weeks it stopped working at all, wasn't getting any power. I'm fed up with these FM transmitters - buy a cheap one and they sound like garbage and stop working after a year. Buy a more expensive one, and that one also breaks. I'll maybe try an Apple brand, but they are outrageously expensive, and am afraid they will just break down like the others. Is this just a product that is not built to last? (Also didn't fit in my cup holder very well)"
2,Mostly useless,"I drive a company vehicle that has no input for iPod or mp3. I bought this hoping to stop using earbuds. After six weeks, I have to say it's mostly useless. Sure, there are empty spots on the FM dial, but drive a few minutes, and they change. One can barely listen to a single song before needing to search for another unused frequency. Not a good thing to be doing while driving. Sorry, I can't recommend this device."
3,Pleased purchase,Item arrived in the time stated. Only surprise was some occulsion on the digital area but they were more than willing to have me send it back if I choose to (which I did not because as they were minor occulsions). Teenage was more pleased & we will see how it holds up for her :o)
5,Clever Product!,"Purchased this on an essentially verbal recommendation from an acquaintance. Was very pleasantly surprised by how well it actually works, at least with my Fifth Generation iPod!Fits snugly into existing cup holders with it's spring-loaded side ""grippers,"" and produces excellent sound quality. The hardest trick (and this is going to be purely a function of what frequencies are in use by local radio stations) seems to be finding an open FM frequency that also has open frequencies adjacent to it to prevent ""bleed-over."" But once you find that frequency, this thing works very well!"
1,Not for iPod 3G,"The Amazon Product Description says ""Recommended for iPod 3G, iPod 4G, iPod Photo, iPod with color display, iPod Mini&iPod nano / Dock&charge iPod devices securely in the car's cup holder"". Unfortunately the 3G part isn't correct. My wife gave me this as a gift and I planned to use my old 3G in the car. Big mistake. You insert the 3G iPod into the Black Ipod Docking Station and you lose all control. You can't change tracks or artists, play or pause. The only way to use it somewhat is start the iPod playing a track and then insert it into the Black Ipod Docking Station. Not too convenient. Now that the product is here, it doesn't mention 3G at all on the box. Would be nice if the same could be said for the Product Description on Amazon. Back it goes!!"
1,Quit working.,I purchased this transmitter in Aug. 2009 and it worked until March 2010. Not sure if the cord quit working or the transmitter itself. Will attempt to contact seller but not counting on much feedback from them. I may be a cheap skate but I expect something that costs $50 to last a little longer.
1,Just Stopped Working One Day,"I purchased this in September 2009. It just stopped working in June 2010. Not a fuse problem. Not a problem with the car. My wife also purchased one a month or two after I got mine. It also has stopped working. It's a great idea, but it really should last longer."
2,Great while it lasted,"I bought this item in August 2009 and it was great while it lasted. I liked the ease of use and the fact that it charged the iPod while it played it. Unfortunately, it stopped working in February 2010. I thought it could have been the power cord so I tried a new fuse. The light came on for the power cord but the unit itself wouldn't turn on. So now I guess I will have to find another way to listen to my iPod while driving."
1,Died after a month of use.,"I purchased this product after all the reviews I read and am a bit surprised it only lasted a month. The first thing I noticed was the small shock I received when I plugged the Macally FM Cup to my vehicles cigarette lighter and docked my iPod. The hand docking the iPod was the one receiving the shock. This happened often and being an electrician it didn't bother me enough to return it, but I made a mental note. After a month of use, though, I can no longer use it because it either shorted out or something blew internally. Now, I am wanting to return it to get my money back but it sits on my dining table as a paper weight. It might be worth mentioning that I used in several different vehicles during that month; whether that contributed to the problem I don't know, I wouldn't think so. Hope this helps."
1,Very frustrating,"I am a first year Ph.D. student, and I find this book quite frustrating to read. The reading drags on and on, and I can't really remember what I read. The examples in the book are somewhat helpful, but they do not seem to fully explain the concepts very well. I hope the next edition will have a more comprehensive explanations for the concepts in the book."
5,modern classic,"great book for research design/methods nerds who want to think more systematically and deeply about the nature of scientific research (paritcularly in the social sciences). A challenge for my Masters students to absorb, but appropriate for PhD scale scholars."
2,"Dense, verbose & incredibly boring","I had to read this as a 1st year doctoral student. It was awful. My entire cohort agreed. Even one of the 2 co-instructors agreed. We all took a few chapters and created outlines of those chapters for everyone else so that no one person would have to read more than a few. Frankly, if we had not done that, I would not have read the book. If you are a professor considering texts for a research methods course, this is not a good choice. It is intensely boring (I cannot stress this enough) and far too dense to be very practically useful. To add insult to injury, with better editing and much better writing, it could have been 200 pages shorter, too."
3,Well....,"The parks are very hard. Notably hard are (and these are accesible from the start) Funtopia in Corckscrew Follies, and Whispering Cliffs, and also Haunted Harbor (you get after beating 1 in Corckscrew) is so small and impossible. I shut it down and built over that dumb Woodpecker ride.Anyway, This expansion leaves much to be desired. Nothing has changed except rides and scenarios. There are some new paths but the gray tarmac works for me.So worth a buy...maybe. But the guest's thoughts are on a limited scope still. And they aren't smart at all. Your ParkMap should be more detailed,!"
3,to hard,"I like this game and play it now and then, but they just made this game way out of most people's league. Most of the parks are impossible to build on, that or when you finally get the hang of ityou need more land and then you run out of money.I only recommend this to the die-hard gamers."
4,Cute story,Love the way this little book give children a chance to image the story -- very few words but wonderful pictures!
1,Don't believe the hype,"This book was not what I thought it would be. I thought it would be a nice coffee table book - that it would be cool to pick up and flip through - but it reads more like a college textbook, and if I could, I would sell this book back to the college bookstore."
2,Big Book of Minimal value,"Much repetition and too little of artists neither western nor white...or male for that matter. Though the sections are a lovely idea the same art is used in each. A not terribly risky venture, this."
3,The Big Book of Art,"This is a great history book on art for like they say an overview from cave paintings to pop art. Most of the materials have been compiled before in several volumns on various topics so if you want it all in one spot and a general survey of it this is great. There is, however, a disconnect to the renaissance happening in Today's Art, both realistic traditional and digital contemporary. It seems just a tad superficial that you can cover art all in a one stop read method, so for people who really want to delve into a particular aspect of art you'll need to continue reading the separate references.Deborah Chapin -The Chesapeake by Deborah ChapinDeborahChapin.com"
5,the big art book,"this is the most awesome art book i have ever seen. from cave art to pop art. full color photos of all the paintings and sculptures...you can't beat it. it's beautifully done. it's a give to my niece who is an art history student. she will love it. it's for her birthday in a few days. if i love it and i am just a lover of art, i am certain she'll love it as an art history student. it came well packaged, and in a decent amount of time. thank you!"
4,Great for Beginner Interest in Art,"I bought this for my savy 13 year old grand daughter who is interested in art. She poured over it, finding things she recognized and appreciating the way it compares different time periods, styles etc. Great buy for the price."
2,Just a very general art history book,"If you're serious about art, save your money. This is a very basic art history book, quite juvenile in my opinion. But if you're looking for a crash course in art, this might do the trick. The layout is also somewhat confusing; structured like a long running time-line throughout with very brief descriptions of genres in the later 1/2 of the book. You get what you paid for."
3,An Unfortunate Necessity,"Unfortunately this is something I needed for my cosplay and it wasn't until after I purchased it that I thought, ""Hm, I wonder if I could just make this?""Pros:- It's something I can wear casually since it's pretty neutral.- It does look like Itachi's necklace.Cons:- Cheaply made. The clasps look like they could fall apart with a good tug from a child.- Technically the round pieces are too big to be a true representation of Itachi's necklace. The necklace is also a bit too long and would need to be pulled back in.Overall (rating is 3):- If you are at all crafty, try making it first. You could probably create something more durable than this.***Note: I bought this for $16.95. I see that it's now been reduced to $9.99. In that case, it's probably worth it to save yourself the time/headache of making it yourself."
2,Itachi's necklace,As soon I took the necklace out of the box the ring on the left side on the necklace came off and now it wont even go back on.
3,If you practice cosplay then buy it .,"it somehow looks like in the picture but if you have thick neck the i suggest or either get on a appropriated diet or get a larger neck-lessalso it doesn't last a good time, it will break after quiet some time of use . if u plan to buy it anyways. use it once in every month so it last longer"
4,Good,"I do indeed love this necklace. In fact, I never take it off. Itachi is my absolute favorite Naruto character so having his necklace was a must. It's never nice, a good length, comfortable, and light. The only, teeny, tiny issue I have with it is the little silver things move too freely. I expected them to be stuck in a certain spot but they're not. It's fine and it doesn't take away from my love of this necklace, but most of the time one is behind my head while the other two are in front and all up on each other.It was definitely worth the money I paid for it and I'm glad I bought it."
3,Not to wear everyday,"I really liked it when I first got it but after wearing it a few times one of the metal pieces fell off. I guess you get what you pay for as the price was low. So its really no big loss, I just super glued it. It was licenced mechandice which I really liked and I continue to wear it. But I am still looking for an actual jewelery necklace copy of Itachi's."
3,Metal rings are slapped on there,"right when i pulled it out of the box the metal rings were already coming off, all i need to to is pull on one and it pops right off. Make sure you have glue on hand to put it back together"
4,Busy Farm: A Pop-Up Book by Sian Tucker,Our son loves this book so much he's worn it out. We are buying our second copy today. It's great fun and would rate five stars if were a bit more sturdy!
4,Enjoyable,"Enjoyable read, I've read it three times, it made me laugh and cry, it's really heartwarming. It's written in an anecdotal style, with stories about different Amish families and individuals whom the Doctor served. When it's funny, it's very funny, such as the anecdote about contraptions and the baby's eyebrows. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the writing style, but maybe it just needed tighter editing."
2,Starts Off Good...,"a little bland and confusing at timesA good portion of the book is about Amish women having babies at Barb's house with Doctor Lehman present. Some good stuff. Started out interesting enough but over time, became superfluous."
2,house calls and hitching posts,skipped a lot of pages while readinga lot of boring partstoo much bragging about certain things
5,A Great Read !,"I bought this book because I was curious about Dr. Lehman's experiences. For I was once a member of an Old Order Amish sect. Before becoming an author, I rode horseback through farms to check on ill members. I really enjoyed his stories. I am recommending it when I am on tour this month.Sicily Yoder aka Teresa PhillipsAuthor of, ""Leaving Lancaster County."""
2,5th grade writing level,I can't believe this book has 4 1/2 stars! The writing was so terrible and the stories so very generalized and brief that I actually returned the book!
5,Magical!,"I was getting UTIs all the time to the point that I went to a urologist. Nothing was wrong with my kidneys or bladder, but I did test positive for a UTI twice in one month. My doctor gave me Cystex and told me to take it as soon as I felt any symptoms of a UTI coming on and/or every time after sex. I have not had a UTI since! This stuff is a life saver!"
5,My current marathon shorts,Pretty much use these exclusively for my runs. Nice inner compression feels good and keeps your junk from chafing while looking like a regular short on the outside. I could do without the pockets though.
4,AM/FM Radio with armband,"We purchased two of these. One of them works great, the other one had a problem. The left side of the screen doesn't show any numbers. Since we didn't realize that until we had already opened it, put batteries in, tried to set it...it's not returnable to Amazon. The one that works is great though, ear bud seems a little large, but otherwise good."
3,Wishing for Elaine Stritch,"Unfortunately, this is the only recording of this fun show. Elaine Strirch starred in the original on Broadway and in 1999 at Carnegie Hall. It would be great if either of those performances were on CD. This recording captures the witty lyrics and some of the emotion, but Noel Coward was a fine writer and not such a great singer/performer."
2,Buyer beware,The book was disappointing. I returned it. I was looking for something with much more detail. The book seemed to be written at a middle school or early high school level.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The reason why I purchased this item is because I wanted to compare it to the Paul Gordan musical. I was sadly disappointed with this 60's version that tried to make Jane Eyre a comedy rather than a dark and gothic musical that the novel portrays. I tried to listen to a full song, but couldn't stand it and turned it off. From what I have just listened to, the show doesn't equal the newest Jane Eyre musical at all."
1,Just plain Awful,"Don't bother with this one! If you want to hear a really great Jane Eyre musical, listen to the newest one (Gordon/Caird). That one is faithful, contains lovely melodies, and the acting is phenomenal! Don't waste your money on this joke of an adaption."
2,Mixed review,"The book begins in dynamite fashion!! You cannot go wrong quoting John Wooden. Quickly you move to a forward by Leonard Sweet, this guy dreams in the brightest shades possible. The beginning chapters up through the 4 types of ""space"" (Public, Social,Personal, Intimate) are right on the mark. Then it seems like a whole departure is taken rebuilding the whole permise begining at the ""chemical"" level, through the ""front porch"" and finally findy harmony. This is very distracting for me and left me hanging terribly. Randy Frazee in ""Connecting Chruches"" does a much better job of laying out and explaining the connecting principles. I learned alot until page 75 then it was downhill for me"
2,This book could be called &#65533;Louisville Death Trip.&#65533;,"Um... here is a review I am passing on:""This book is another of Michael Lesy's strange photographic essays of a trip into the past. His most famous is titled ""Wisconsin Death Trip."" This book could be called ""Louisville Death Trip."" It has chapters on Main Chance, Love, Money, Whites, Blacks, Power, Visions, and Sunday Feature, with photographs of street life, Ohio River life, car wrecks, black people, death, shops, factories, romance, poverty, suicides, wealth, police, criminals, ministers, and alcoholics, and many other fascinating subjects, taken in Louisville, Kentucky in the 1920's. Very strange, almost gothic, photographs!""I pass this on so people wanting historic normal photos do not think this is the book for them."
2,That last guy is a winner,its just a lock. You just cant put a zip disk in. it does not replace the drive. Little slow eh?
4,Great Grouse Book!,"I bought this book to gain information on raising grouse in captivity. It is a great resource for this. A very thorough guide to all the grouse, their habits, distributions, food and foraging behavior, reproductive behavior, and much more.Book has many color photos and illustrations. If you are a bird breeder and want to try breeding grouse the behavior and feeding sections in the book give incites intothe lives of each species that may be invaluable to you in keeping them in captivity. Highly recommended to the gamebird breeder!"
2,Brand new edition already outdated,"I used the third edition of this book on a trip two weeks after it was published. But I found that much of the information was less reliable and up-to-date than in the Frommer's guide, which is about a year older. Examples: the information on Perurail never mentioned the fact that it is now owned by Orient Express, and is mostly a luxury service with changed schedules, increased prices, and some discontinued lines. And in Ollantaytambo (not a town with a lot of hotels to choose from) this guide didn't mention the three-year old Hotel Pakaritampu, whereas Frommer's correctly identified it as the nicest hotel in town. The reviews of other hotels and restaurants also turned out to be less reliable and useful than Frommer's. This guide does have much good background information on Peru's history and people, and has good maps of the cities. We ended up using this book mostly for background reading and used the Frommer's guide more for practical information."
2,editors need to review accuaracy of reccomendations,"Although some of the reccomendations were excellent, other reccomended restaurants or lodgings were closed or did not seem to exist. This was not a problem with the Lonely PLanet or Moon guidebooks. I had the annoying experience of trying to go to eat at a place reccomended by this guide book and then finding out it did not exist or was closed. I wish the editors spent more time verifying that their reccomended places were still open and in the same locations on the publication date. The maps and side information were decent.I would definitely go with the Peru guidebooks from Lonely PLanet, Moon, or Let's Go over this guide."
2,Insufficient,"Before our trip to Peru, we bought the Rough Guide: Peru. It was a poor choice. For us, there was too much irrelevant information. And, for what we did want to know, there was insufficient information. Make another choice for a more detailed and informative guide book. Check it out at your local bookstore, before buying on-line."
4,Looked good and was the only C3PO at the kids' parties we attended!,"This costume wasn't available in our local Target, so was unique and the only C3PO we saw this Halloween season. It fit our 8 year old son well, and held up for a few wearings and is still in good shape."
4,Good Intro to Theology Text,"This is a useful textbook. Olson does a good job of explaining core Christian beliefs clearly and demonstrating an irenic approach to theology, without assuming that the reader needs to agree with him about anything outside of traditional orthodoxy. He does come across as rather defensive about Arminianism, though. It's a little dry, but not overly difficult. This would be a fine choice for a general theology course, though I wouldn't choose it for either a systematic or a historical theology course (Olson's other book, is a great historical theology text and isn't dry at all:The Story of Christian Theology: Twenty Centuries of Tradition & Reform)."
1,"Measuring Stick, Alum",Really disappointed in the lack of durable components and lack of craftsmanship. The plastic fittings didn't last long and the flimsiness of the components don't allow any level of precision or accuracy. Would opt for a more durable and well constructed measuring component if I could find one.
3,Good but not great,They work and aren't too old but the phone only holds 2 days charge versus 3 to 5 when it was new. Guess they just don't make anything like they used.
1,"Good on delivery, bad on advertising","I admit - it was a gamble. My father has the V265, and the battery is dying. The actual battery model # did NOT match the image that I saw for this battery. But they claimed it fits the V265, and the actual battery with the correct model# was going for $22 + Ship/Handle.This went for a bit over $7.5 with Shipping.So I lost on the gamble. The battery does NOT fit the Motorola V265. And for me to return it by paying another $2-$2.5 for Shipping isn't worth it to claim what could essentially be a $2.50 credit.oh well. So ...buyer be aware on not-completely-true advertising when it comes to the V265. When looking for a battery...go off the Battery SNA/Model #"
4,good battery,i needed a new battery and found this one at a great price...it works well and stays charged which is all you can ask for so i would recommend this for a backup or replacement battery
1,i never recieved my product!! billed but not recieved.,Never got my order. Tried to contact company twice was billed to my cc but never received order.
1,Motorola OEM battery,This battery was useless--would not hold a charge for more than an hour or two. No better than the one I was replacing.
1,battery was bad,when i recieved this battery it was bad when recieving it. but with the cost of shiping and all i do not want to send it back... that is a big wase of money on a item cheaper like this..
3,Easy way to learn French.,"Like the short sentences, can figure out the French words and what i can,t I can figure out by its context. Didn't really purchase it for the religious aspect."
5,Oldsters Only?,"I'm in high school now, and my interest in things like the banning of books caused me to research the most COMMONLY banned or challenged books. I was shocked to see 'Halloween ABC' on the list. I remembered the book, so I checked around to make sure it was the same one. Coming across this website, I read people's various reviews on it, and noticed that everyone seems to agree that this book is mainly for older children. While I agree that older kids can enjoy this book, I thought I had to say that I have incredibly fond memories of reading it - over and over and over again - during first grade. Niether my mother nor I had any problems with the pictures or the poems in the book. I naturally respect everyone's opinions, but I just had to say that 'Halloween ABC' is simply to good a book to bar from younger kids libraries!"
2,PG-13 not Ages 4-8,"This book is a collection of positively gruesome rhymes about violence, ghouls, and monsters in the vein of Edward Gorey. Some young adult readers might find the rhymes amusing, but many other readers, especially young children, will find them quite disturbing. As one example, for the letter ""I"", we read that ""I"" is for icicle, the murder weapon that mysteriously vanished leaving the police puzzled. If your kids like grim reaper stories for Halloween, they may find a lot to amuse them in this book. However, the kids who are old enough to potentially appreciate the book's warped humor will probable overlook the book since they are way too old to be practicing their ABCs."
1,Cheap and Broke,"These look nice, but broke the very first time I was trying to install them. Don't bother with these, you'll just have to go through the hassle of trying to return them for a refund."
3,"pretty, but perhaps not for all curtains","These Heavy-Duty Polished Chrome Roller Shower Curtain Rings are gorgeous and match very well with other chrome bathroom hardware such as a chrome shower curtain rod. Be aware, however, that due to the design and the roller-balls the rings are quite top-heavy. So your shower curtain will need to be heavy to keep the rings from flipping upside-down and the shower curtain should also probably not be very stiff. A little upward movement on the curtain will cause enough slack for the rings to flip, also). Adding some weights on the bottom-end of the rings would be quite helpful in keeping them upright."
5,Great rings,Glides perfectly. I wish it had a was more appealing to look at but functionally far exceeded my expectations. Great value.
5,So far so good!,"After years of plastic rings that barely budged or cheap metal hooks that ripped my curtains and popped off constantly, I got fed up and purchased these rings. I've used them for a month now and they're still doing great. They appear to be rust free and glide easily around my old ceiling-mounted shower curtain ring. I have 3 nice fabric curtains and one cheap vinyl curtain lining my clawfoot tub, and unlike cheap hooks or rings, these rings don't strain or pull on the curtains---and the rings don't pop open!---even with all the weight.I was a little worried because these were pretty cheap compared to others, but so far, I've not had any problems and I am thrilled to be rid of my old crappy hooks for a fraction of the cost."
2,not strong,"I got over the fact that they hard to open, but I didn't realize that I was going to have bend them to get them around my shower curtain rod. Also they are not that strong or durable. I have one snap while sliding the curtains onto it. I am thinking they should have made it hook-like or easier to manage. Good thing I had an extra plastic one to replace the broken one."
5,very much enjoy these,"Best shower curtain rings I've ever owned/operated. While I thought that they'd be a bit thicker I guess they didn't need to be since they're quite sturdy. I bet if I tugged on my shower curtain the rod would fall off before these come undone. I was surprised at how well they glide when I went to close the curtain, I'm used to giving it a quick tug so that it slides all the way but with these a gentle pull easily closes it."
5,Awesome,Bought these for my mom's shower in 2006. Still working wonderful. Still shiny. Everyone keeps asking her where she got them from.
3,HARD TO OPEN,TOOK ME ALMOST AN HOUR TO OPEN THESE HOOKS AND PUT THEM ON THE CURTAIN. IT TAKES A LOT OF STRENTH TO OPEN THEM
5,Smoooooooooth,"These hooks are great! The shower curtain now slides back and forth easily without getting stuck on the connection in the middle of the rod. Before these I had decorative S hooks and every time I opened or closed the curtain some of the hooks would fall off the rod, so I was constantly putting them back up. It was completely annoying but for some reason I lived with it for over a year before I just couldn't take it any more. I hesitated buying these because I didn't think they would look as nice, but now that they're up and work SO WELL I don't care. I love them!"
3,Nice and durable,"These rings do the job- they're durable and pretty. Unlike other rings that I purchased in the past, these stay closed and haven't caused any problems."
4,"Slightly more than I would normally pay, but they work just fine","I splurged and went for these chrome curtain rings. Bling bling, right? I assumed that the lil balls would help the curtain just glide open. Eh, they work just fine. Slightly more than I would normally pay for them, but they're pretty ballin curtain rings."
5,A nice working set of curtain rings,"Our old shower stall is nearing the end of its useful life, so I thought one last update with these rings, a new curtain since our old one looked like a cat with its claws out jumped down it (which is still possible now that I think of it), and a new rod would do the trick. And it did! The rings are every bit as good as the other reviewers say they are. Pretty sturdy, shiny, and of course they glide very nicely. When we replace our shower eventually, I am planning to reuse all of this stuff."
5,Like these very much,Very good shower rings. Like the fact that they have rollers-- makes them glide with ease! Also like the fact that they are shut tight and shower curtain can not fall out.
4,Pretty nice and quiet,"These rings are OK, but there isn't anything especially heavy duty about them. They are just regular roller shower curtain rings like all the other ones out there. Nice, but nothing special. Amazon had quite a few to choose from, and I chose these because I thought the ""heavy duty"" description was true, but it wasn't anything but a marketing ploy to sucker me in to buying something I thought was a little better than the rest, and paying a little more for than the rest."
2,"Not a good bye, poor quality and hard to use.","This roller was anything but ""Heavy Duty."" I liked the way the rollers looked, but not very well made. Difficult to get the shower curtain and liner onto the rollers. They need to come up with a better design."
4,problem resolved,The first set I received was evidently a cheap imitation. I posted a review and the company contacted me and told me about the mixup. Sounds like Amazon confused the item for several buyers -- the real version comes in a plastic clamshell package and is more rounded; the imitation is more wedge shaped.The company sent me the real curtain rings and they are much nicer. Thanks!
5,super,"They are perfect, the shower curtain slides perfectly. (sorry for my bad english, I am learning....)"
1,Hostile Packaging,"The people responsible for this packaging are either exceptionally stupid, incredibly greedy, hopelessly oblivious, or some combination of all three.The product comes in a molded plastic package that has to be destroyed with a sharp tool in order to remove the shower rings. The force required to destroy the package and the sharp edges you are exposed to in the process is DANGEROUS.If a fit man with experience in construction, mechanics, and heavy equipment operation struggles to get through this packaging, imagine how your mother or grandmother would fare.Take a stand. Don't reward morons with your business.(Shame, too, because the rings are great!)"
2,Balls of steel,"I thought I'd try a very similar ring to this one, attracted by the ""rolling steel balls"",but after a year of use, the steel balls have worn away the chrome plating on the rod andnow the top of the rod is coated with rust. Maybe a better quality rod would not be subjectto this problem, or I suppose you could take a hair drier to the rod and rings after each shower.The idea is sound but may be best to use with a plastic or wooden rod."
5,No problems so far,This roll along our metal shower rod without any issues. No complaints so far. They do not seem like they will rust either.
5,Great quality!,"I replaced some other roller rings with these and am happy I did. They are indeed heavy duty, and they snap in place so that they cannot come apart accidentally. Highly recommend."
5,Perfect for intended use.,only 1 issue. I live in an apartment and the shower curtain rod is cheap aluminum or something and when these slide across they make an awful lot of noise. Otherwise perfect.
5,Work great.,These things are exactly what I wanted. They are lightweight and a bit on the noisy side. Easy to use and look great.
1,"Nice to look at, but cheap materials","My wife and I had a new curved shower curtain rob installed after we renovated the bathroom. I thought the rollers on the curtain rings would make a nice touch. However, when I attempted to place these on the rod, two of them broke. To keep the rollers at the top of the rings, the manufacturer pinched the ring on each side of the rollers. This pinch made the rings themselves to thin to be opened and expanded while placing them on the rod. We do NOT have a extra thick curtain rod. I did not return the product, but probably should have."
5,Great compliment...,"Loved these rings (classy; stylish) especially with my new Crescent Shower rod (a lovely curved rod that actually gives you more room in the tub!)... Nice nickel finish that compliments the satin nickel accessories in the new bathrooms. They really dress up the look - being a designer, these ""minor"" details truly add up! I recommend this product with enthusiasm!"
3,"Pretty, but Cheap","I've had these for 4 - 5 years. I love the looks. A few times a week I'm fixing 3 - 4 of them because where the metal rings ""fit"" together . . . they actually stretch past its ""fitted"" position. Also - there is not a stopper for the beads which causes them to fall down all the time. Great for a guest bath that may not be used frequently."
3,These hooks are not meant for the bendable shower curtain rod,"The hooks are fine on their own but they were recommended along with the bendable shower curtain rod, however they are not designed for that rod. This is because the bendable rod has support rods which go into the ceiling and the hooks get obstructed at those points. We had to use other hooks that run within the inbuilt tracks inside the rod."
4,Great hooks!,"I recently purchased these hooks, and they're great.Pros:- Look nice- Match any curtain- Glide very easily over the rod- Don't fall off the rod (always had that issue with my old hooks)Cons:- I had some difficulty closing the hooks once I got the curtain on, but this was mainly because I'm short and it was hard to reach them on the rod. Once I got help, we had no problem."
5,Fantastic,"They are what every other reviewer has said - smooth gliding and does not hang. I use the Moen one piece curved shower curtain rod with these, and it has been bliss! Holds the thick shower curtain liner and the shower curtain itself with ease. Perfect amount of rollers in the bag. Wouldn't hesitate to purchase again."
3,Heavy Duty - Polished Chrome Roller Shower Curtain Rings - Set of 12 RollerRingsTM,"I've had these for a few months now on a straight metal rod. They look good and work well, but they do corrode despite being advertised as corrosion free. The glide is very smooth, but against a metal rod, the rasp of it gets pretty noisy."
4,nice,“The shower curtain now slides back and forth easily without getting stuck on the connection in the middle of the rod
5,Solid product/design,They look nice and do the job well! No problems with these since I bought them. I'd buy them again.
4,What a sigh of relief!,"I bought these shower rings to replace a set of difficult to use hooks that my boyfriend had bought. These work like a dream!!! I no longer have to tug at the curtain with all my might! So easy to get in and out of the shower, it barely takes any effort. The bar we have is old and not very slick but it doesn't even matter with these. Took off one star because it is a little difficult to get the rings around the bar without the bar getting scratched up. Doesn't really matter for our old bar but might matter to someone with a brand new shiny bar :)"
4,Good produce,"This product works well but allows the end pieces to constantly move around, causing a gap between the side walls and the shower curtain. The normal cheap ones cause friction, but it actually works well to keep them tight at the ends of the shower curtain rod."
3,They don't slide that great,"They were pretty easy to hang and they look nice, but they stick a little when they slide. I thought it would be a lot smoother. Maybe it's just my shower rod, I don't know."
5,You and your shower curtain will love these roller rings!,I finished a bathroom renovation recently and got rid of my shower doors in favor of a curtain. I remember the old curtain rings and how they used to resist being moved and always seemed to snag on something. I saw these roller-rings on Amazon and they looked like they would work well! And do they ever! I have a tension curtain rod and the rings never snag on the mid-point. These are fantastic.I stayed at a Westin hotel recently and saw these in their catalogue for over double the price of what I paid for them on Amazon!
2,Any glide improvements aren't worth the sharp noise !,"Honestly, I don't think plastic rings are that difficult to glide on the rod, and most gliding problems are caused by the connection joint in the middle of the rod (which isn't remedied much by these rings either).The primary reason to buy these rings, is the aesthetic one, since they definitely look better than plastic. Being, a practical person though, I regard aesthetic as a bonus, not necessity, and I can't stand the sharp noise these make when you glide them. It's one of the more annoying household sounds, on the par with that made by the coffee grinder (except you can't cover your ears with noise-canceling headphones when you take a shower), and it kind of ruins the whole shower experience, even if the sound is brief.So, buy them if you only care about looks, don't if you mostly care about relaxing, stress-free showers (since annoying, sharp sounds are more stressing, than a slight resistance in gliding the shower curtain)."
2,Yuck,"These rattle and come detached easily. EWas glad to leave them behind with the old house! Thay also let ""loose"" of the waterproof covering and let the linen exposed."
3,A pleasant read!,"I think Falconieri does an excellent job of mixing actual historical events with the fictional perspective of the Miller family. I do have one quibble, however. By the end of the book it seemed that all the ""good"" aristocrats take no notice whatsoever of class differences, while all the ""bad"" aristocrats go around literally and figuratively stomping the peasants under their boots. I don't think either extreme is really true to the time period."
4,Beautiful!,"This is a great a book... but I only think it deserves four stars. This book may make girls think it's okay to lie, cheat, and disobey their parents. Although it's just the setting for the great, wonderful story, be careful. Other than that, A GREAT BOOK!"
2,This book is written well and is very dramatic.,"This eloquently written book overemphasizes a dramatic teenage New England summer.This author has excellent word choice which will keep a reader reading this book until the very last page. Emphasizing relationships, this book gets the reader to think how the main character's life relates to him/her. All in all this is a very powerful and stunning book."
2,Like lead,"This performance of the Cello Suites is heavy-handed and lugubrious; there is nothing dance-like about it. Jaap ter Linden's very deliberate approach is effective in a few isolated movements, but generally dampens the spirit of the music."
1,better to buy from authorized dealer,"returned once i recieved - was able to negotiate a good price at an authorized dealer - amazon is not an authorized dealer, therefore tag will not honour any warrenties or work on any watches sold by amazon"
4,The book about the Jeeps,This book is about Jeeps.I like this book.I like this book because it is about the Jeeps.I like the Jeeps.
3,YMCA !,I have heard some better upbeat versions of YMCA but probably they was made in Europe. This one is OK.
5,"as a long time fan of the chieftains, I think this is their",Best album yet. All of the songs are done by women and the Magdalene Laundries alone is worth the album. Most of the songs are irish classics done with a more personal emotional twist. the Chieftains provide the strong background music that is missing in some other albums.
4,Tears of Stone,"I bought this album because of the Rankin's contribution--I'm a huge fan of the Rankins. Definitely my favorite song on the CD is Jimmy Mo Mhile Stor--beautiful! THe three Rankin sisters sing like angels. WHen that song came on, I closed my eyes and didn't move a muscle until it was over. I liked most of the other songs too, but the Rankin's contribution is the one I'll listen to over and over."
4,Wow!,"I bought this album for Natalie Merchant's contribution (which is gorgeous) but the rest of the album is great as well. This album is beautiful and I highly recommend it, especially the Joan Osborne track Raglan Road."
5,A wonderful new sound,"The Chieftains latest, Tears of Stone is a wonderful album comprising not only of traditional songs, but blends of jazz and japanese as well done by many well known women artists like Bonnie Raitt and Loreena McKennitt. This album not only makes you feel good, but is perfect to listen to anytime."
5,An exquisite collection of music...,"An exquisite collection of music that improves with listening. Proof positive that Celtic melodies transcend borders -- with the direction of the Chieftains, of course. Opening with a beautiful reading of one of my fondest Yeats poems, the collection of music proceeds through a wonderfully balanced mood of music, most of it on the longing side of life, to be sure. Akiko Yano's ""Sake in the Jar"" grew on me after I noticed just how effectively the Japanese nasal intonation jibes with that of the Celtic instruments. And I've got to hear more of the Rankins and Sissel! Joan Osborne's reading of ""Raglan Road"" primed me for her upcoming album. ONE COMPLAINT: How come no lyrics and translations?"
2,Disappointment,"After reading only praises on this album, I was sure I'm gonna hear another great Celtic masterpiece. But, there's nothing in it. This album consists of love songs, all of which sound quite the same. This album doesn't remind other Chieftains albums, and hardly reminds real Celtic music. Don't waste your money on it, go buy ""Fire In The Kitchen"" instead."
1,Disapoiningly boring,If you expect another fantastic album like The Long Black Veil you will be disapointed in this rather boring collection.
2,Lilith fairies?,Next I think the Chieftains should do a collaboration with the Chipmunks.Really- at least it would be funny and cute. This is pretty thin fare. They seem to be relegated to back-up band for some overwrought ballad singers.Chieftains did a great job with Nashville -Bluegrass crowd and Long Black Veil was super.This seems like a blatant milk the Irish thing.Totally harmless and nearly safe for children but just not very good.
4,Omit Joni,"I am a vocalist/guitar player who has always loved Irish ballads and most of what the Chieftains do. I am ecstatic about the Joan Osbourne cut--it will blow you away. But Joni Mitchell has NO right to be on this collection. Her song is pathetic and her voice is sub-par. Everything else is very easy to live with. Ever since I first heard Joan Baez sing ""If I were a carpenter, and you were a Lady"", I have not been able to understand why the words aren't appropriately changed when a female singer sings words that state she is singing as a male to a female. But that is forgiven here for the most part. Still, in this collection of Irish love songs (except for Joni's hate diatribe against nuns...) it puzzles me that they couldn't come up with more songs written in the feminine person towards a man. Oh well, these are misogynistic times I suppose...."
3,Something of a disappointment,"I love The Chieftains and was really looking forward to hearing this CD. While it is good, I was a bit disppointed with it too...the songs individually are fine, but the general tone of the album is too slow and somber. I feel it needs more variety. As I listen to it from start to finish, I find myself getting a bit depressed by it.Some highlights are Saki in the Jar, The Magdelaine Laundries and the long instrumental set The Fiddling Ladies...Remember though that I am judging this against the standards of other Chieftains albums which is a very high standard indeed...If you are seeking an introduction to their music, I would suggest ""The Long Black Veil""...or ""An Irish Evening"""
1,You'll never listen to this more than once,"This effort by the Chieftains is joyless. It is aptly named for it will surely depress you. We listened to it once and never took it out again. In fact, this is a good reminder to myself to throw it out."
5,The best album I've heard all year!,"Such deep emotion, such a unique blending of styles.... Such innovation from a talented band of old guys. My only complaint is that they don't put out more albums."
1,Wrong Item Showing,"This appears to be a trend and not a pleasant one...the item shown a product from Vermont American, and I purchased ""Insty Bit"" G2575 counter sink - set of 5 that sold for $20.22 not the $13.83 of this item. The ""Insty Bit"" is a tried and true product that has longevity in its blood-line. We hope the quality is unchanged and will continue to meet our needs. The seller "" Midwest Cabinet & Supply, Inc. "". The item shown is sold by ""ANTOnline"".I believe ""AMAZON"" that you are doing a grave disservice to both the customer and the supplier by not getting the asked for review and the correct item to match!"
3,makes sense but not a lot for your money,I wish they would sell you just the attachment to the seat belt for less $. The harness is useless if you already have your dog in a harness.
3,The gold washes off,"I had high expectations for this book after reading a review from Jack DuBrul saying that he's read this novel more than once. When reviewing Mr. Schoonover's website, he mentions that readers read this book more than once. It's not necessarily a mainstream action adventure novel; matter of fact it's rather obscure. I will surely not read it again however. The action is okay, with several slow spots, where only Ol'Thunder saves the day. I liked the adult theme woven into the action story, (wish more writers would include it) but there are points in the book that simply collapse and take forever to get through. While well thought out in some ways, the conclusion is nothing more than an old movie murder/mystery where all the players are convened in the dining room waiting for the famous Inspector to reveal the true murderer and the motive (the butler did it). It takes about 70 pages to tell us that Col. Mustard, did it with the rope, in the library."
5,"These books are magical, to say the least","This title For Love of a Horse, and the other eleven in the series are the best horse stories I have ever read - I can't believe they are currently out of print!?! This first book sets up the series, where Jinny and her family move to the Scottish highlands and Jinny rescues Shantih from the circus and brings her home to Finmory. Patricia Leitch writes in a way that lets you share in Jinny's happiness, pain, family life, and perils of growing up. The other books in the series in order are: A Devil to Ride -- The Summer Riders -- Night of the Red Horse -- Gallop to the Hills -- Horse in a Million -- The Magic Pony -- Ride Like the Wind -- Chestnut Gold -- Jump for the Moon -- Horse of Fire -- Running Wild. I am lucky enough to have read them all and own eight of them, and have read them over and over. Please reprint these(!!) so a new generation can enjoy Patricia Leitch's Jinny stories."
2,COULD YOU GET THE PAPER FOR ME?,"I can't believe I watched the same film as everyone else. I thought the humor was lame. One of the funny parts was when a pretty woman acted as a shill at a shoe store. Another real funny time was when Fran's mom (Sally Noble Hager) drops her son off at off. Rick (Chris Stack) is watching and waving saying under his breath, ""Wave if you want it."" Okay, this stuff was funny in the 7th grade, but as an adult I had a hard time making it through this film.Fran (Larry Dahlke) sells Futons and aspires to be a mattress salesman. He is going to race against Rick for the spot in a mini marathon. Meanwhile he is attempting to start a relationship with Carmen (Angie Craft). The romance aspect was done poorly also. The characters were poor cliche caricatures. It is this type of film that gives ""indie"" a bad name when people rave over garbage.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
5,"A really, really fun surprise...","THE MINI is a funny, sweet, often laugh-out-loud surprise of an indie film. With this roller-coaster comedy that from a pure entertainment standpoint is so far ahead of the average dark or dreary indie film, you are going to have FUN! In anywhere USA Fran Molon is a normal guy with really bad luck. And he works with some low-grade characters at a riff-Raff bedding store. He only gets to sell futons, which is obviously not cool! The annual mini marathon is around the corner and Fran gets involved. He is going to run against his nemesis at work for a promotion, which is just absurd and also really simple and fun."
5,Wish there were more,"My four year old has been bringing up God a lot to me, especially since my devoutly Catholic parents came for a visit. I want my son to respect adults so I didn't want to disparage anything my parents had told him but at the same time, I wanted him to know that some people believe in different things and that it's okay. Then his camp took him to see the movie, Evan Almighty, and my son came home telling me that he had seen God and that God talked. My boyfriend showed him a picture of Morgan Freeman on the internet and explained that he was an actor pretending to be God. So I've been reading this book to my son but we haven't gotten through the whole thing yet. There just aren't a lot of books like this for his age. This is a little bit over his head and he's somewhat bored by it but it is doing what I needed it to do."
1,How pathetic,"This game is the definition of pathetic. My brother bought it, not knowing what to expect. You play PIGS for crying out loud! The game design is convoluted, choppy graphics, impossible to play, its like they never tested it (or completed it rather) before they released it. A sad story, really."
5,Superb book by the world expert on badgers!,"With all the ""politics"" about badgers in the UK, it is not easy to get unbiased information. This book provides a wealth of factually-accurate data, and lots of illuminating anecdotes about many many years of badger watching. Whilst it 'aint the cheapest badger book, do not be deterred by the price; as it is absolutely worth every single cent!Truly the best book about badgers. It combines in-depth factual information with the authors experience and many illuminating anecdotes about badgers and their nocturnal behaviour. It is a book that every-one who studies or deals with badgers should read from cover to cover, and keep on their shelf for reference."
2,Music Student,I'm a vocal performance major and I thought these would help with my sightsinging. They didn't. They are way too big and not very practical. I say; find something else.
3,Just okay...,"Not a lot of detailed information. Each day's prayer takes about one minute to read and the information about the baby gets very vague during the last trimester. I was looking for something I could use to study the Bible each day and provide details about baby's daily progress. However, there are some good days and info and the baby talking to you is kind of cute."
2,The Shame of Golf's Great Cover Up,"The Author fails to bearly mention the FIRST American to win the British Open, i.e., Chicagoan, Jock Hutchison the 1921 winner. Hutchison's name is left out of the list of winners by year. Hutchison, who championed the early use of a grooved club, i seems is shunned by writers of golf history. Setter of low round records at the Old Course on two separate occasions in 1921, Hutchison won on his very first attempt at the Claret Jug. Read the whole story in ""Grooves: How Jock Hutchison and His Grooved Clubs Changed Golf History."""
5,Thought provoking illustrations and very well written.,"Reflection contains very thought provoking illustrations and simple text that can test a child's as well as an adult's imagination. Each time you read it, you will discover something new. Travel with this child from the beginning to the end of this book and back."
5,Fascinating artwork!,Our family loves these books! What a great way to teach a child that you can look at things in many different ways. Wonderful artwork!
4,Getting along in Understanding French,The author of the book was amazing in his language Knowledge which is reflected in the book very helpful for people learning french although dated it helps with pronouciation and grammar in a easy understandable way. Worth having a copy
4,The dame of Tango ... and more,"Her voice and performance has given her the title of Dame of Tango. This remarkable artist has recorded many unforgetable songs through the years and this collection shows the essence of Libertad Lamarque. ""Cantando"", ""Uno"" and ""El día que me quieras"" are excellent samples of Tango, as well as ""Cuando vuelva a tu lado"", ""En mi viejo San Juan"" and ""Arrancame la vida"" are the best performances a singer could do to those songs."
2,Sena case for Iphone,"After giving Sena a poor review for customer service and a broken belt clip on the Tan flip case I bought for my Iphone, I must edit my comments. To my surprise, when I checked my US mail the Saturday after my review, there was a replacement belt clip from Sena. I'm now a satisfied customer. The replacement appears to be of better quality than the original. Still, I wish they'd get rid of the plastic belt clips.Thank you Sena for sending the replacement."
1,Sena's Customer Service is Lacking,"I recently ordered an item from Sena. I was really disgusted at their customer service and the email they sent me was rather rude. I will never do business with them again and hate that I spent nearly $80 for products that are less than great. They scratch easily and are not rugged. I had the case for a matter of days and the leather is already ""rubbing off."""
1,Not worth your time!,This is a two paragraph document that contains nothing that you can't find for free on the internet doing a search for Histrionic. Don't waste your time or money...not worth $.25 much less $1.50!
3,"Strong Acting, Weak Story, Overall French","Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised to see Kristen Scott Thomas speaking French. Maybe I should have.We started the film with the English voice overs. Don't do it.Switching back to the subtitles, the acting and the mystery of the story kept us engaged throughout the film. I love French film, generally, all angsty and uptight characters learning to be a little relaxed and this wasn't a let down.What did let me down was the big 'reveal' at the end with regard to Scott Thomas's character. I don't want to spoil the ending, but I'd be hard pressed to find anyone who can say her reasoning was sound for keeping the details of her secret regarding the death of her son.It was pure stupidity.But her performance was brilliant."
5,Great Performance,"Great performance from K. Scott Thomas, an Oscar should have been awarded ! Beautiful story. Great Movie, I watched twice in the same day and will watch it again. Love it."
2,It Loses Credibility,"Yes, it's beautifully filmed and acted -- the first two thirds of the film are mesmerizing. However, when Juliette (KST's character) finally reveals the motive for her crime, I felt completely duped. Why would a reasonable woman keep secret a motive that would (1) spare family members from the conclusion that she was a callous murderer and (2) likely give her a shorter prison term? There's no good reason. What started out as a five-star film turned into a bad ""Movie of the Week."""
2,francophiles only need apply,"very slow moving, with some interesting moments here and there but overall not believeable, not compelling. One waits for it to be over.A nice review of spoken French."
3,"plot lacks, but performances are great...","great performances by all the actors, esp. Kristin Scott Thomas. A good family drama, regarding tension between two sisters. One has been in prison for many years, and is now released and trying to put the pieces of her life back together again and re-establish ties with family."
2,"It's the Economy, Stupid","Pass this book by if you want thoughtful analysis. Apparently, Mr. Chilton thinks the 1992 elections were about abortion. It is amazing in hindsight how silly that idea seems. This blinded focus undermines much of the book. Further, Mr. Chilton could stand to tone down his purple prose. Stick to the facts!"
5,"Very sturdy, lightweight and roomy","Excellent buy. I couldn't believe how sturdy yet lightweight this dryer was. Plus, I was able to fit a full load of clothes (from our large capacity top-load washer) with ROOM TO SPARE!!"
4,Earth Friendly,"I bought this garden clothes line in order to save energy and have my laundry dried in the sunshine smelling clean and fresh without the use of a chemical softener. However,where I live the winters are long so it is not used as much as I hoped and my drier has to be used in the winter. Nevertheless it was a good buy and I hope to take it with me when I move, unless the next person who buys my house is as earth friendly as I am. No HOA here to stop the line going up because it might 'spoil the look of the area'."
4,solar clothes dryer,"this one is more solidly built than the last one. it is all metal, where the one that broke had plastic hinges. this makes my electricity bill about $50.00 cheaper each month, & i'm killing the earth a little bit less. it also could have been about a foot taller. i am only 5'4"" tall."
1,Not for serious laundry,"This is the third aluminum clothes dryer like this we've purchased in 5 years. Doesn't save much in energy costs if we have to buy a new one every year or so. This unit is fine if you only have light weight items and they are short, because any wind at all may collapse the unit. Oh, and don't but wet towels on it. They are too heavy. We just built our own unit out of galvanized pipe. We'll see how this holds up."
4,Umbrella Clothes Dryer,"Product was easy enough to set up considering its size, the swivel feature is great. Not easy enough to take down to make this a daily process but will come in handy in case of extreme weather."
4,Works like a charm,"I use the suggestion of another reviewer here and place it in the umbrella slot of my outdoor table. It's a bit lightweight, but does the trick. Easy to tuck into a closet when not in use."
4,Good value!,"I have been using the clothesline between 2-3 times a week for almost 2 months. (The previous owner had a sleeve installed for his clothesline, so I can't comment on the ease of installation in the ground.) The clothesline works fine, definitely a good value for the price. I put out one load of laundry at a time so that I can space things out in my humid climate. The clothesline is quite roomy and has handled the weight of wet clothing without issue. The collapsible arms make it easy to put away if a windy storm is coming. The cording/tubing is a bit slack, but I haven't needed to tighten anything yet. I'd recommend this item and look forward to many years of hanging out my family's laundry!"
3,feels flimsy but works well,"Using it almost daily, a bit fiddly to open, and the arms feel flimsy, but if handled with care should last. I put mine in a large plant container filled with broken concrete - mobile if need be with a hand truck (e.g. to garage for indoor drying in rainy weather). Cut your power bill GO SOLAR TODAY!!!"
4,Umbrella type clothesline,Product is a very good value for the price. It isn't as heavy duty as the one it is replacing but it is more than adequate for our use. I was fortunate that I could use the old mounting socket and did not have to dig a hole and pour cement around the plastic socket that came with this unit.
5,Nice,"It is all it says and more. Wife loves it. Quick de,ivery and very good price. No problems at all so far"
5,Clothesline,"I received the product as promised, but am a little confused. I thought that a travel bag for it was included, but there was none. I haven't used it as of yet, just got it put up; but if it doesn't rain tomorrow....will be trying it then. Will let you know how it handles."
3,Can this product be used in a market umbrella stand?,"I'm wondering if the people who have purchased this product would say that it could be used in an umbrella stand? I'm on hillside, and there really is nowhere to put it in the ground. Right now I'm using the balcony rail for drying some of the bulkier items, and I'm considering buying this dryer, but I'd like to know if anyone thinks that it could work in an umbrella stand.Thanks!"
3,Daits,"Well, the clothesline is wobbly in the hole and one of the lines was cut to short the item would not raise until I untied it, so I am out one line until I buy a long enough line to fit it. It seems unsteady to me. I am about to go hang clothes on it for the first time we will see how it does."
3,Clothes Dryer,"The product was shipped quickly. I have installed the base but haven't used the dryer it's self yet, it may be spring now."
2,Cheap...,"I bought this and never put it up. The seller is great, pretty fast delivery, but the item was cheap quality and the box was damaged as well as the item itself.It went into the trash real quick."
1,Easily damages,"Our first time using the product, it was a little windy. However, we had under the load amount on the lines and the pole sleeve was anchored in the cement, so we did not think there would be a problem. The clothes dryer bent so that the arms are now unuseable. So, I guess it would be okay if you live somewhere that is not very windy. :("
4,"Good equipment, but could be a bit better.","I have one of these many years old. It is very durable, but not well machined and a bit clunky to operate. No matter, it is the best you are going to find and it is quite usable.Two comments:The center pole creates a line several inches too short for a 6' person to get by without ducking. Very annoying if back yard space is small. This can be overcome by humping up your concrete fill a few inches above grade.The cords are too stretchy and the whole thing needs a funky tightening session a time or two a year.That said, if you are just getting into a new drying alternative, enjoy! It takes a little getting used to. Avoid the chemical softeners and soon you will love the fragrance of crisp sunshine."
4,Great!,"I am completely happy with this product. It is light, sturdy and was easy to install in the yard. The only thing that kept me from giving it the full five stars is that when you close the umbrella lines, it is a little hard to expand back out. Not a big deal because it does go, it's just a little harder than I imagined it would be. It wouldn't keep me from buying it again.My dryer is nice and happy not to be running all the time!"
2,Good info but few pics or illustrations,"I was disappointed in this book because there are very few photos or illustrations, and those that appear are not in color. Also, I assumed the book was solely about floral gardens (because of the lovely cover) but it actually covers lawn care, fruit trees, vegetable and indoor gardens, etc.; not that much is devoted to flowering annuals/perennials. (My fault: I should have previewed the table of contents). The section on insect control is probably the best part of the book. Although other readers might be very pleased with the book and all the general info it contains, I would not have purchased this book if I had seen it beforehand."
3,note to editor,"I have just opened this book and found a pathetic error. I have yet to start reading the book but it recieves a ""3"" off the bat. In the front of the book, where it has maps of Africa in 1955 and 2005, THE MAP OF 2005 DOES NOT INCLUDE THE COUNTRY OF MALI!!!!!!! IT IS LEFT OFF THE MAP!!!! It's borders are within Mauritania and Mali is not labeled. How does this get past the editors of what is suppose to be the best book written on Africa in ten years! wow."
5,"""Third Volume"" in a Series","I found this book by Martin Meredith to be an excellent followup to a couple of books that I already have in my library--""Africa to 1875"" written by Robin Hallett (1970) and ""Africa Since 1875"" also written by Robin Hallett (1974). The second volume by Robin Hallett ends with the post-World War II independence movement in various countries within Africa. Martin Meredith's book begins with the independence period of time and focuses largely on the second generation of these independence leaders in the various countries of Africa. Moving from the first two books to the Martin Meredith book was a seamless transition--just as if they had been written by the same author as a part of a three volume survey series on the history of Africa."
4,Good value,OkThis was a good purchase. You get what you pay for and more. I hope to get many miles out of it
4,So much more...,A riveting narration of African troubled historyTextbook material turned into a moving revelationObjective and thorough yet compelling and captivating
2,"Good information, terrible editing.",Content is informative and well-written. Editing is disgraceful. At least four times I found myself reading what appeared to be a section that belonged in a different chapter.
2,Explains nothing.,"The blurb from Publishers Weekly on the back of the book has it right: this is but a digest of Africa's woes - it describes everything and explains nothing. I was hoping for an explanation of why Africa has gone backwards as they rest of the world has progressed - why Africa's leaders have been so exceptionally venal, cruel and megalomaniacal, why its people have submitted to such misrule for so long. But you won't find it here.As a digest of African post-colonial history the book is a fine one, the writing clear and the organization sensible. It just wasn't the book I was hoping for."
4,An explanation of Africa,"After reading this book, I came away with a better understanding of why Africa is in the precarious situation it is in. After years of leaders making and breaking promises, the people have had little progress. This book follows the path of this story, which is told in a clear , readable manner by the author who clearly knows his subject matter. From independence to the Big Man rule, to glimpses of hope the author explains it all. Just read the book through if possible, otherwise you could lose track of what you are reading. To help go to www.one.org or www.data.org."
4,Novice Historian,"I picked up this book at an airport bookstore more than a year ago but only read the first couple chapters before setting it aside and forgetting about it.I picked it up again and finished it. I am 44 years old and truly ashamed for how little I knew about this continent. I had it drilled into my head that all of Africa's woes were due to the awful ""colonists"". I never heard the full story, never heard the other side to the droughts and famines which caused thousands upon thousands to starve, never heard boths sides of the genocide stories.This book is a worthwhile read if you want to open your eyes to a problem which is far deeper than a legacy from the bad ole colonists. A study of African history should be a MUST for high school and college students the world over. Maybe then can history stop repeating itself."
1,deception,"A one-side, westernized and very negative book on Africa. Africa is more than blood, sickness, starvation...As for me, it is also unthinkable to write a book on the subject (20th african history) without a mention of the greatest african leader of the century, Thomas Sankara of Burkina Faso. Moreover, Sankara would have been disgust by this book's title, as if the situation of the continent was hopeless (without the western world) and African weren't the one able to change things for the better."
5,Terrifically Informative + Extremely Depressing,"I read this book 2 years ago, and it haunts me still. I've since gone on to read two other of Martin Meredith's books (""Diamonds, Gold, and War"" and ""Mugabe""). He's an extremely companionable author, and his more-or-less deadpan tone is perfectly suited to the very depressing subject matter he covers in this book. From famine and genocide to the absolute corruption of lawful states, this book covers the consistently tragic history of post-colonial Africa."
5,Exactly the kind of history you want to read..,"a very detailed page turner without the shallow, lopsidedness of many other 'fate-of-Africa' sort of books. All in all, a very satisfying read."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the book. I was expecting the book to have pictures of many beautiful wrought iron signs that are common in France. However, it only had one. Most of the pictures are plain text signs."
1,"nice photos, atrocious text","The images are fine, but the text is the equivalent of hearing one of those obnoxious, ignorant and loud tourists babble endlessly about their bigoted views. Being a lover of France and having lived there for over 30 years I got this as a gift. It was only when I started to read the text that I started to think ""hey, wait a second... what the hell?"" Thankfully, not even insultingly dumb text can scratch the belle france. As the locals would say, ""merde!"""
1,DOES NOT RUN ON VISTA,"Neither does ""Aqua Nox 2"". I was looking forward to playing this on a modern system. The publisher told me they are working on it, but I don't hold much hope for that. Too bad. Lost money on software, again."
3,Great Sci-Fi Concept - So-So Execution,"I really liked the concept - a society forced to live deep under a mostly dead ocean; but the gameplay needs work. In Aquanox, a mixture of underwater combat and trading, you fight for pay that you use to upgrade your ship.The one thing that struck me about this game was the interface; it reminded me of Elite, an old favorite. The control setup has a bug in it however, the game likes to reset your joystick settings, but proper setup is crucial for a successful sortie in your sub.I agree with most of the reviewers about the voice acting: it's really goofy. Some actors are really good, others are terrible. The sub combat phase of the game is fun, although not very innovative. The weapons are fairly fun to use, I liked polishing off enemies with torpedoes.In conclusion: Its worth the discounted price, but don't expect anathing new."
1,Aquanox - Where You Never Leave Your Ship,"Aquanox is one of those games that makes you wonder if some game designers have any idea of what their competition is making. It's like getting dressed without looking in the mirror. I look at terrific games like Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, Half Life, or even The Sims and this game just can't hold a candle to them. (Probably because it takes place under WATER.) With all the time spent in my ship and never really going into the docking stations visited, I got downright claustrophobic. Air! Air!Pros:The graphics were nice.The game setting, underwater, is original.Cons:Horrible voice acting.The feeling that you are watching a filmstrip when the rest of the world is watching DVDs."
3,Hyper-Conscious Warning Film Gone Overboard,"A German high school class project spins out of control, as one teacher's efforts to demonstrate the ease with which a willing public can be enchanted by an autocracy unwittingly ends up glamorizing it. The blunt, one-note lesson is clearly meant for viewer and participant alike, and that gives the unenviable impression we're being lectured to, warned against the catastrophic risks without fully understanding the flip side. The speed and relative ease with which this diverse classroom is willing to conform to a hive-mind is suspect, as is the instructor's dull misunderstanding of the stakes. It's well-acted and some of its steep, lofty warnings hit home, but the extremes of that message and the melodramatic tones it constantly strikes remind me of an after-school special. A great topic, with a harsh climax, that falls into far too many traps."
3,Not a Summer Storm surely,"The Wave is of team values as imperative for personal victory and overcoming private problems.A very sensitive topic for Germany, it's embedded from a general notion of fascism as only a way work in team leads to as a teacher-ex-monarchist tried to make a class water-polo team winning a competition.It is not aSummer Stormsurely, also shares common motives while being too idealised, politicised and showing no way out.This work is interesting for depicting some things as they, probably, are for teen Germans of the modern FRG."
4,The Power of the Group,"I've seen the old version many, many years ago and the whole experiment was very impressive. When I had to select a movie for my Group Dynamic class, I immediately had to think of this one. That's how I found out that there is a new - German - version of ""The Wave"". They did a great job transfering the story into the Germany of today. They added a little more drama towards the end than the old version.I think it is a very informatic story (that actually happend in the 1960s) we all can learn from and if you are studying group dynamics - perfect!"
4,Social Conformity,"This movie is based on the book ""The Wave"" which was inspired by the social experiment ""The Third Wave"". In the book this scenario takes place in a factious high school in the US. It is, however, based on a true story that took place in California. This movie ""Die Welle"" (The Wave) is set in a German high school which makes it very intriguing as they experiment with the idea of social conformity and whether Nazi ideals and influence could happen again. Not possible, or is it?Movie is done really well with the exception of a few trivial errors in editing. Slow start and sound effects can be a bit annoying, but very good story. The main actor, Jürgen Vogel, does an excellent performance as Rainer and his character keeps the movie viewer on edge because one is not sure how or if he will end this project.Patti"
2,Only Worked Once,"I only got results from this after taking the first pill. Every dosage taken afterward has done little to nothing to unclog my sinuses. I'm building little mountains of tissue paper, coughing and wishing I had bought Afrin nasal spray, which always cleared up my sinuses."
4,Best Natural Media software out there!,"I have been a regular Painter user for a few years, comming from a traditional background in illustration and animation. So far, Painter 7 has definitly openned up a new creative world for me. The plethora of tools in this software are fantastic, and make a nice compliment to Photoshop. I am yet to see another application that does a better job of emulating natural media. There are some bugs and the interphase could use tightening up, but still this app is a must for any digital artist, graphic designer or CG arsist."
4,I liked this product very much. My family ...,"I liked this product very much. My family went on vacation last week and was able to use the sunscreen. We were all in the water a lot, and the sunscreen stayed on very well. It wasn't greasy and had a nice fragrance. I will continue to purchase this product for my family."
4,I was very pleased with the way that ...,"I was very pleased with the way that Bullfrog worked. It wasn't sticky at all. And when you put it on and didn't reapply it for hours, it still prevented my family and me from getting sunburned. I have a son who is in and out of the water all day, and he was out for four to five hours without getting any sunburn. He also loved the smell (watermelon), so getting him to let me apply it was no struggle at all. He also loved the froggy bottle it came in. In my opinion, this is a very good product that I plan on using again and I'll tell my friends about it."
4,"For a kid, especially my little boy, a ...","For a kid, especially my little boy, a good-smelling sunblock gel with a toy attached is the way to go. It has a nice, fruity smell and the clear, waterproof gel was very easy to apply, although it tends to be a bit runny. I thought it was neat that you could apply this on your skin just one time and it works up to six hours while you're in the water. My son and I, although for different reasons, would definitely recommend this products for kids!"
2,This product was used on my nine-year-old son ...,"This product was used on my nine-year-old son (blonde with fair skin). We live in the high desert of southern California. The sunscreen worked and had a pleasant smell. The color is clearish, so there isn't any white streaks if it isn't rubbed in well. We wouldn't buy it again because it leaves a very greasy film on his skin, which ends up on whatever he touches. (Then, because it's waterproof, it doesn't wash out well.) My son complained that it felt """"heavy."""" He wanted to rub it off with a paper towel. If the sunscreen is wiped off because it feels yucky, it can't do its job. We'll stick with our usual brand."
4,Quality Product vs. Expensive Product,"I use this wheel with a Playstation 3, for Grand Turismo V Prologue. The force feedback is top quality allowing me to feel each and every bump, turn, spring compression, and crack. It does not also have a rumble system with takes away from driving on gravel or impacting another object. The independent gear shifter is very fun, but is also inconvenient to locate comfortably. The pedals are very nice having independent resistances to supply a true to life feeling. Overall the raw quality of this product has made it worthwhile despite the exurbanite price tag."
3,logitech g27,this is a good wheel. the only problem is all the wires it requires to work. how long till they make a wireless version of this wheel. Takes to long to set up connecting all the wires.
4,The best available,"This is the best wheel/shifter/pedals I could find, and it has exceeded my expectations. I'm VERY happy with it. There is room for improvement with the pedals (too close together, my feet are always hitting each other), but otherwise it has been perfect for me. I have been using it to play GTR-2."
5,It just doesn't get better than this,This is the best racing wheel on the market. Period. All the other wheels(including Logitech's own MOMO) look like toys compared to this. High quality materials and craftsmanship and the shifter is amazing. Great force feedback. This racing wheel and a copy of GTR2 is all you need to burn some serious rubber. The price is a little higher than what I usually pay for gaming devices but hey you get what you pay for..
2,Okay Wheel,The wheel is not as precise on the PS3 on wheel alignment and shifting with the manual pedals is not a realistic as I expected.
5,Must have if you are a racing sim fan,"This wheel/pedal combo is like no other. The feel of the wheels, the pedals, and the feedback system are top notch. The G25 is very easy to setup, and if you are up for the challenge, to modify. The Cd contains blueprints and templates of the components so you can take them apart and modify placement to suit you. I've taken apart the pedals, placed them on a sheet of metal on my rig and ""inverted"" them so they hang just like the pedals in your regular car. Setting this up was pretty easy using the templates included.My only complaint would be that the h-gate shifter is a bit weak. If there was a way to strengthen up the ""feel"" it would send this already solid package into the stratosphere. The feel of the shifter in sequential mode is fine though."
4,Logitech G25 wheel review.,"I bought this wheel and 5 days after I received it it failed. I got a replacement from logitech and now about a month later I have to do it again, this time it is just the shifter unit.Other than that the wheel is absolutly amazing. I can't use any other wheel after having this one."
5,The best wheel ever,"If you take car racing seriously, then you must get this racing wheel, is the closes feeling to real racing."
4,A little pricey for what you get.,"First of all, if you want a racing wheel, this is hands down the one to get. The only problem I have with it is that the price was too steep for what I actually got. Amazon's description made this wheel seem slightly better than it is. The force feedback is not as strong as I expected. The gearbox has no resistance when you shift. The pedals seem a little too close together. The wheel itself could be a little bigger but I can see why it's not so as to save space on your desktop. I use mine with my PS3 and every time you turn the system on or off, the wheel starts spinning to calibrate itself. This also happens whenever you start a game. It scared me at first and now just seems really annoying but can be solved by just unplugging the USB chord when not in use. These are all minor problems that most will probably overlook. It's worth buying but I'd try to find the best deal you can on it, don't pay over $240."
3,"Ok Wheel and pedal system, not hard core though.","If you are a casual Sim Racer that doesn't mind parting with $200, then this is the wheel for you. The force feedback is realistic, and the pedals look pretty high class.If you are serious about your sim racing though, you will find this setup lacking. The shifter is cheaply made, and feels it. Shifts are hard to make due to the sloppyness of the shift gates. The pedals lasted about 500 races in iRacing, which would probably equate to 700+ hours of heavy usage over about 10 months. Now the Potentiometers in the pedals have to be cleaned every few days, requiring opening of the pedal case and blowing them out with compressed air. I'll be moving up to a set of CST pedals, but they cost twice what the pedal/shifter/wheel combo does."
5,Fun stuff,Haven't played this for a while but it's fun when I do. Much better control and the foot controls are well made. No problems with it so far and the forcefeedback is accurate enough for my tastes.
4,Great for the money,"First the good.The feedback is strong and prescise. Very smooth steering and it will immerse you into the game. NFS Most Wanted and GTR 2 are great with this wheel. The shifter is awesome, although you do not want to beat it up. A ginger approach makes it work best. The pedals are very solid with good tension, although you have to have very small feet if you are going to use all three. I use my clutch for the brake forgetting the middle pedal.Now for the bad.The clamping system works, but for how long? Plastic screws are only going to last so long, and you have to really tighten them for the wheel to stay put. There are mounting nuts on the bottom, but are you going to drill 2 holes through your desk? Microsoft has a superior clamp in my opinion. The shifter works well, and I am sure it will last with care. Be nice to it though. The pedals are to close together. Other than that, they are perfect.Overall, I highly recommend this wheel. For the money you can't get a better wheel."
3,logitech G25,I would rate this prodoct overall a good product. It has how ever had a few problems. The table clams mechamism does not seem to hold properly on all surfaces and tend to slip off the edge. which can be a problem if you are in the mid of a tricky corner or trying to avoid a another vehicle. The tightening knobs are also difficult to turn and tighten. Hex bolt might be a better idea.
1,Do not buy for PS3!,"Do not buy this for PS3 especially if you are looking for a wheel easily compatible with Gran Turismo. It is not one of the indicated wheels and comes with PC installation instructions. The controls are not corresponding to those in the options menu. Sure, pedals aren't metal, you don't get a clutch pedal and the steering wheel isn't leather wrapped but the GT steering wheel is a better value for most gamers."
3,Bonus Tracks Save the Effort,"""Maria"" is classic Blondie, while the rest of this album is a valiant effort to relive the magic of yesterday. Although it falls somewhat short, it's a worthwhile try. The three live bonus tracks not indicated on the album jacket (Dreaming, Call Me and Rapture) save the album. The magic is still there in the live performance, bringing back some great memories. Nice job Debbie."
4,"smooth as silk, cool as air","I enjoy the music on this CD very much. Who would be better for a tour of eighties music than BLONDIE, one of its pioneer. The band is great. Deborah Harry is, of course, the centre of interest. Her voice has improved with age. It is more sensual on songs like MARIA, DOUBLE TAKE, and DIVINE. Her sense of invulnerable vulnerability is even deeper, making me not want to want her in an even more helpful helplessness than before. ;D The first cut is a, well, scream. One of the most effective raggae songs by a non-Jamaican band I've heard in a long while. What made me happiest of all was to discover the three secrets. If you are interested in the music of the eighties or want to hear what one of its pioneers is doing now, this CD will interest you."
1,Please exit. Now.,"Spurred on by a lively TONIGHT SHOW performance and an enticing new release sale price, I picked up NO EXIT. At the same time I picked up a copy of PARALLEL LINES from the bargain bin in a fit of nostalgia. Bad move. Blondie's masterpiece still stands up twenty years later, nearly every song as addictive as it was when first released. Blondie's new effort, however, is hard to listen to. The single, ""Maria,"" is catchy as hell, but it wears off after one or two listens. Then you're left with $12.99 worth of filler. And Coolio. Need I say more? Other reviewers are being a little nicer and giving a few nice words for a few other tunes - and there are a few that aren't painful to listen to - but don't bother. Pick up PARALLEL LINES - it's somewhere in the sale bin for $8.99. You'll have saved a few dollars and you'll get so much more for your money."
3,STILL WORK TOGETHER WELL AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,"THE BAND IS STILL SHARP AFTER THERE TIME APART. SUPRISINGLY UPBEAT, QUICK PACED ASSORTMENT."
3,GREAT COMEBACK CD!,This is a great comeback cd for Blondie. However that rapping in the title track HAS TO GO!! A couple of the songs near the end of the cd are boring but over all its definately a must for Blondie fans!!
4,Still Great After All These Years!!!!!!,"If you love Blondie, you will absolutely enjoy this CD. There is a wide range of songs that don't all sound alike. ""No Exit"" proves that times may change, but people don't. Blondie has come back after all these years to a time where music has changed dramatically and has given us a totally great compilation of music, that possesses & captures their distinct sound, spirit & fun! They still know how to rock us! A must if you are a Blondie fan!"
5,This album just doesn't live up to the hype.,"After 17 years away from the recording studio, Blondie's much-anticipated new album fails to deliver the goods. Except for a few rare moments, most notably the song ""Maria,"" the songs here are slow-paced, even dull. Deborah Harry's voice sounds strained on most of the tracks. Even on the bonus live tracks of Blondie's classis songs, such as ""Dreaming,"" her strain in hitting the higher notes is painfully obvious.Of course, the band can't be expected to perfectly duplicate the raw punk excitement of ""Dreaming"" or ""One Way or Another,"" but there is a differnce between down-tempo and sluggish, and unfortunately, this album falls into the latter category."
4,The best CD of 1999,"This CD has many styles and moods, and expresses nearly all of them very well. ""Maria"" - a great rocker. ""Double Take"" - the smoldering ballad. ""Nothing Is Real But The Girl"" - an upbeat foot-tapping rocker. ""The Dream's Lost On Me"" - a country waltz - are you kidding me? I almost fell off my chair when I first heard it, but it's great! Full of bravado and optimism. Debbie sounds as great as ever, and the musicianship and production is top-notch. It's now September of 1999, and this is the only CD this year that stands out as being a great one."
5,An instant classic,"This opus proves what we knew all along; no band influenced by Blondie has surpassed them. This is such an original set of songs; the music has a sort of dark, funky horror movie feel, and is at once memorable and moving. The band is doing rock and roll, and doing it their way, in a time when rock and roll hasn't delivered.The production is very clean and epic, but it doesn't lose its raw innocence thereby. I can't recommend this CD enough, not only to Blondie fans, but to anyone who loves rock and roll."
4,No Exit,"No Exit~ Blondie is a nice straightforward new vawe pop album and as usual they are not affraid to mix styles and have rap, new wave, rock and pop fused on this album. The lyrics are ok and serve their purpose. However, the book-let is travesty. The photo is on the cover just looks bad and as if they invited some friends to take the pictures instead of a photographer. I would have been happy if this was the low, but alas the rest of the book-let is even worst with no lyrics, font that is hard to read and the photos inside the book-let are way to avant-gard for my taste. I love Harry's vocals and the muisicianship of the band is quite good indeed."
1,Maybe I can auction off this cd.....,"This is the worst cd I've ever heard, or close to it. There is no sense of style in any of the songs and unfortunately Maria is the only halfway decent song. Keep your 12.99 and buy something worth listening to. Blondie, time to retire babe!"
2,see you in 2015,"Clarification: Blondie is a band past its prime. For this we waited 16 years? It sounds like one of Debbie Harry's sub-par solo efforts. Prince said it best....act your age, not your shoe size....."
2,NO EXIT you better Find One,"I got this cd when I was in the 8th grade I was really excited because I have always loved Blondie and the song ""Maria"" I really liked so when I got the cd home I put it in and listened to it. The only song I liked was ""Maria"" 2 other songs on the cd were ok, nothing spectacular. I've tried listening to it yrs later(now being 19) and still think it is abseloutely awful all I really listen to all the way through is ""Maria"" as a Blondie fan I was really disappointed by this album the songs are terrible not really catchy if your a fan of Blondie purchase another album not this one. That is why this gets 2 stars it's awful."
2,Hul la hoop!,"This is a Hulla hoop! sounds the same! MARIA was released in 6 versions! on techno, on disco, on pop! my GOD,..why?"
4,Welcome back,"OK, so it's no Parallel Lines. But it's just nice to have Blondie back. Listening to this record is like seeing good, old friends. There are no surprises, you know what to expect, and you know you're going to like it. No Exit is the follow-up to Autoamerican that The Hunter sould have been."
2,Who The Hell is This Band???,"It may offer the same cast of characters but ""No Exit"" sounds like anything but a Blondie album and that's too bad because Blondie was one of the best pop music makers in their day.It's not that this is a bad album, it just isn't a Blondie album. There's no bite, no stab, no ""Rip Her To Shreds"" attitude. The cover may offer a pic or two of stilletto heels but they're not in the music. This effort is for show...not to go.The real problem is that this album can't make up it's mind what it wants to be. You have half hearted attempts at many genres of music and that makes the listener feel empty. No cohesive plan is the culprit here. You wait all seventy plus minutes and there's not one track up to par with the energy of Blondie's first five LP's.If you are a Blondie fan... sorry, I'm a huge supporter of this act and this CD just isn't worth their legacy. Now where's my copy of ""Eat To The Beat""?!"
5,Wonderful investment,"If you are questioning whether or not to purchase Blondie's latest album, I say that you should definitely buy it. The new album is up to date, but you can still feel that old Blondie style that is uncomparible. I suggest that you buy this CD you'll have it in all the time"
1,What Happened?,"This record is a big dissapointment. It can't compare to the bands first three records. The current radio hit ""Maria"" harkens back to the early days, but the rest of the record falls flat. What in the world is Coolio doing on a Blondie record? I guess it's true, you can never go home."
2,Blonde is back,"Blondie were the first band i really got in to and started buying their singles in 1977 (9 years old). As a male I was infactuated with Debbie Harry and also the music. The music was catchy, raw and in your face. So needless to say I was overjoyed at the prospect of a new album. The single, Maria, was excellent and on this I bought the album. Unfortunitley the rest of the album just falls flat on its face. There are no more catchy tunes and everything seems disjointed and thrown together. I was very disapointed to say the least. I give it two stars for Maria but other than that buy Parrallel Lines if you dont own it and give this one a miss."
3,"Re-formed, some hints of the past.","Blondie ""No Exit"" (1999).Blondie's first album in 17 years, ""No Exit"", brought back some of Blondie's charm, but still it was far from a great comeback. Debbie Harry was 54 years old at this point, but she still in great voice. This album gave us the classic ""Maria"" #82, other favorites were, ""Screaming Skin"", ""Under the Gun"", which was dedicated to Gun Club member Jeffrey Lee Pierce and the title track with Coolio. 5 years later they would release their 8th album ""The Curse Of Blondie""."
4,GREAT RETURN B+,"After many years away from the music scene, Blondie, has returned with a first class cd. From the opening of ""Screaming Skin"", to the applause of the fans on the 3 live hidden tracks, this is a great return. The musical style of this cd is all over the place, rock, punk, country, reggae, lounge. For the most part it all fits into the Blondie mold. ""Marie"", is outstanding. The same can really be said for the first 4 tracks. Some songs hint of their past glories, without repeating them, instead they take the next step with that sound. Other sounds just head out unto new areas for the group. A welcome return. B+"
5,Great CD from Blondie,"After hearing ""Maria"" played over and over again on the radio, I just had to buy this CD. It certainly doesn't disappoint. The CD is familiar enough to bring back memories of the Blondie from the 80s - but there is also new sounds that are completely unique to this CD. Some songs have a lounge type feel to them, while others have a tropical sounds - and then others are typical 80s New Wave. Its a very versatile CD, and the songs will definately catch your ear. Deborah Harry sounds just as wonderful as she always has. A ""must"" for any Blondie fan."
4,It grows on you.,"When I first got this album and listened to it, I thought, ""What a waste of money, I should have just gotten the 'Maria' single and saved my money"" Then I listened to it a few more times, saw Blondie in concert, and all the songs have grown on me, especially ""Under the Gun"" and ""Forgive and Forget"", which I absolutely love. I'm not too fond of ""No Exit"" and ""Happy Dog"", but I expect, given time, that might change. All in all, a good strong album."
5,eclectic and FUN,This is a must buy for anyone who is a fan of somthing different and unpredictable. Her use of many musical styles is eveident and refreshing. I highly reccommend this off beat cd.
4,Triumphant Return of Blondie,"This is the best CD album that I bought this year. Every track grows on me after each playing. Standouts include the torchy ""Boom Boom in the Zoom Zoom Rooom,"" the current hit, ""Maria"" and the pop flavored ""Nothing is Real But the Girl."" Deborah Harry is in true form throughout this stellar CD!"
3,Odd,"This is a decidedly strange and uneven album. It's good to hear Blondie again, especially on the catchy hit ""Maria,"" which shows that it really isn't hard to make good pop - just get a good band to play the hell out of a descending riff and some hooks. The rest of it has an odd, kind of dark conglomeration. It is refreshingly off the beaten path of mainstream pop, but where it goes isn't terribly exciting. It's worth the listen for some weird vibes, but generally not the kind of thing I'd want to listen to more than a few times."
5,Comeback? Blondie has been everywhere...,"...since they left the scene. From Annie Lennox to Courtenay Love; from Madonna to No Doubt. Their music, image and imagination have seen imitators and celebrants of Deborah Harry's and Blondie's work plying the pop music scene with music that was inspired, and indeed, made possible by the trend-setting band who crossed over from punk to create New Wave and a niche of their own alongside the likes of Bowie and the Beatles ( despite the roars of protest by the sexist majority). Basically, Blondie is one of the most underrated bands ever to grace our culture and have had an extremely hard time of it over the years. Therefore, to come out with an album so full of original, melodic and unforgettable tracks is a true feat that makes their comeback album more than just a rehash if old hits ( like all the rest). This album revives the energy and originality that was lost in 1981."
4,Bravo to the Blondie,"This album is way cooler than a lot of the pretenders out there. Not bad for a bunch middle-aged hipsters. Give them credit for coming out with an entire album of new material. Great melodies and fun arrangement. Blondie is still the best in what it does. Though not a masterpiece, definitely a great pop album. Just one minor complaint, Debbie's voice does sound a bit weak in 'Rapture'"
4,A most-welcome and successful comeback album!,"Considering the fact that this CD was made without all of the original memebers of Blondie, it is an excellent album, with many different style of music that Blonide can pull off so well. The styles represented on No Exit include jazz, country, rap, and pure rock and roll that defined Blonide in the 70's and 80's. Blondie still knows how to rock!"
4,"Fabulous comeback stuff worth buying the cd, not the cassett","This is a great album. Ive been a fan for 20 years and its always good to hear a Blondie track. This album could do with some refinement and Im sure theyll do better on their next? (I hope) album but hey? after 17 years, who can complain. The trax are a great mix of styles that Deb includes. I saw the band live here in Sydney and they were unreal! Go get it!"
3,J Destri needs to write more songs!,"Since the 2 best songs in the cd ""Maria"" and ""Nothing is Real but the Girl"" were written by Jimmy Destri I think he should write at least half the songs of the next record.Also get a better record producer."
4,Blondie's lost star but still as sweet,"Blondie's 7th studio album No Exit don't reach the 5 stars which I would rate to the former Blondie albums. Screaming Skin, Maria, Under the gun, No Exit, Double take and Out in the streets are real Blondie classics: strong as ever. But that leaves 8 tracks on the album which don't have the catchy power/punk pop to which Blondie is famous for except maybe Nothing is real but the girl (the second single of this album).Nevertheless Blondie proved with this album that even in the ninety's they are able to release a good record.Maria and Screaming skin are the killers of the album."
2,"Couple of hits, lot of misses","""Maria"" - great song! If only this CD lived up to the promise of the first single. Unfortunately, it doesn't. There are some fine moments - ""Double Take"" is a beautiful ballad; ""Nothing Is Real but the Girl"" jams - but there are some embarassing moments, too. Coolio's rapping on ""No Exit"" is as awful as Debbie Harry's rapping on the dreadful ""Rapture"" nearly 20 years ago. Thank God for programmable CD players!"
5,A good classic,"Folk Stories of the Hmong remains one of the essential books that sadly in most cases will be found in the children's book section.In fact, it is a very well-researched and well-written work that tries to bring the full character of the Hmong myths and folklore to a Hmong and non-Hmong audience.It is one of the first books in the world to try and do so with great sensitivity and appreciation for the challenges involved.The stories are easily readable, and maintains a tone that makes it easy to read aloud much in the oral traditions of old.From a cross-cultural writer's point of view, this is in fact quite an achievement when you're bringing work like this in from a language that has largely never been studied by the West before.While there are other larger and smaller texts out there now, each with its own strengths, Folk Stories of the Hmong still remains a key text to start with for people who are interested in the stories of the Hmong."
3,Neat little mystery,"Kevin Allman has written an entertaining book in""Hot Spot"".Not only is it a coolmystery,he also includes some pointed jabs at our tabloid,celebrity culture.I enjoyed his character Kieran O'Connor,& hope to read more about him.I haven't read his other O'Connor book,""Tight Spot"",but hope to soon.All in all,a worthy book from Allman."
5,Very good detective thriller set in Memphis TN,"This book is very entertaining and fun to read. It has a fast moving story and likeable characters. It is a good detective thriller set in Delta blues country. The hero, J W Ragsdale, is a great, hard bitten detective character. I'd like to see another book with him as the leading character. A friend bought this book for me and I wasn't sure what I was in for....I loved it.Duff did a great job."
2,Memphis Mystery...where's the editor?,"Gerald Duff does an interesting job mixing comedy and violent crime--no easy task. Memphis cop J.W. Ragsdale is a well developed character, who goes about solving the murder of a tourist during the International BBQ Cooking Contest and the Cotton Carnival. Duff's Southern dialects and colloquialisms are a little in the stereotypical vein, which is surprising from a former Memphis college prof. The story lines are tied up cleanly at the end, but left this reader wondering what purpose this excercise served. The framework for a great story is in place, and a good revision could have gotten this tale on track."
1,159 page brochure,"What a waste of money. The book is simply an advertisement for Demon carbs and other Barry Grant products. It does discuss the different components between the different Demon carburetors, but there is very little in the way of tuning of said carbs. I read chapter after chapter, hoping to get to what I bought the book for, the technical approach to tuning, but sadly, there is no more information on tuning in the book than what you can find doing a 30 second search on the web. Do yourself a favor and pass on this book."
3,Not a bad score,"I have not read everything in this yet, but enough to say that they really covered a lot of ground. Not a lot of info on ""tuning"", but enough that if you really wanted to figure it out. It is more of a explanation of 4 bbl carbs in general, and the working theory. It is also a 160 page promotion for demon carburetors.After a quick flip thru, I know I will be buying a Demon soon. This no ""Holley"" we are talking about here, but they are close relatives."
2,Demons are Junk,This book is very vague about modifications and tuning of demon carbs....More like and expensive promo tool for buying a demon carb....I have one and thought this book would help me to work the bugs out....didn't work...carb is still a pretty piece of non-performing carburetor...stick with your Holley guys!!!!
3,MOVE YA BODY MOVE YA BODY!,"It's occacional that every summer, there comes the summer jam, NINA SKY took advance of this reggae infectuos track to make it the first buzz of the hot days ahead, it's no lie, it's cathcy, it's stick to your head and does has that HIT single title written, although the curse of stars that make it with a summer jam is to become ONE HIT WONDERS (aka Lumidee), but after all it's all about the JAM and this JOINT sure going to make you move your BODY."
3,fun dance song,the cut is real catchy&It's one of the cuts of the Summer thus far. it has a cool beat&vibe. pretty good dance track&decent re-mixes as well.
5,Move Ya Body Nina Sky!!!!!!!!!!,Nina Sky Is The Hottest Group In Queens. Just Blastin' The RadioWith Move Ya Body. I Think Nina Sky Will Be Big In Tha Music Industry. Do Anybody Know What They R? R They White Or Mexican.Well They Are Dymed Out.
4,Great New Dance Track,"This song is a breath of fresh air. Despite what a previous reviwer said, this song is NOT derived from Elephant Man's ""Jook Gal"" (Remix). Both were put on the new Coolie Dance riddim which hosts tons of hits including the smash ""Pull Up"" and ""Feel Alright."" Despite the numerous dancehall songs on this riddim, Nina Sky puts forth this great dance song that is vocal, not rapped. Jabba's comments also add to the track. However, not to be mistaken for a rip-off of Elephant Man, indeed, Nina Sky's song came first and both take the hugely successful Coolie Dance's beat. Watch otu for Nina Sky, she's already number 17 on Billboard's Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip Hop Tracks & Singles."
1,The name dropping! The pretension!,"Ms. Adler evidently knows everybody who counts. She also has an opinion on every subject and a very high opinion of herself. Her attack on Adam Gopnik is merciless and reeks of envy...since her own contributions to The New Yorker pale compared to his. Finally, do we care about these people? She sure doesn't make me care! The New Yorker was and continues to be a fine magazine, but it's not and never was a national treasure worthy of such detailed scrutiny. Finally, Ms. Adler provides a jacket photo of herself copyrighted by Avedon in 1979! To me that kind of says it all about this book: twenty year old author's photo embellishing nasty mean-spirited gossip about events many of which took place twenty years in the past."
1,Like a homeless person wandering the streets ranting,"Adler takes on the last three decades of the New Yorker like a wandering schizophrenic...mean spirited,pretentious, and the antithesis of the priniciples of writing that made the New Yorker famous. Adler does make a salient point--that perhaps a magazine does have a natural life span and that the New Yorker may have outlived its, but otherwise she weaves through the corridors and picks fights with Ved Mehta's Rembering Mr. Shawn and Lillian Ross's Here, Not Here. With all the books on the magazine most people will wonder whats the point."
1,Sour Grapes,"252 pages of written incontinence. Ms. Adler, allegedly known for her ""prose,"" has produced a work so bitter, that it's utterly incomprehensible. As a 30-year reader of the New Yorker, I think the magazine had improved dramatically since her departure. Good riddance."
1,"Turgid, mean-spirited, clueless","Renata Adler, a writer, of exalted reputation, has produced, a terrible book. The writing, is amazingly bad: turgid, self-important, with commas, everywhere. She criticizes, meanness, in others, while mocking, people's little mannerisms. She reports calling people up, to wish them well, then uses their responses, to bash them. She calls people, humorless, in a book, without a single, remotely, funny line. She sniffs, about recent errors, in the New Yorker, while making dumb, mistakes herself, like placing the Watergate hearings, in 1976. In passing, she smears, people like John Sirica, and praises, people like Gordon Liddy, without offering, evidence, either way. She may, be right about both, but who knows? This is, a book, about standards, that doesn't, seem to have any. Finally, those commas, drove me nuts."
4,A good classroom resource,"I use this in my Educational Sociology courses for a university. They provide excellent background information and visual interaction for visual learners. Graduate level material. It's academic and lecture formatted, but still valuable."
2,very DISAPPOINTING!!!,"I BOUGHT THIS IRON 2 YEARS AGO. I LIKE GERMAN ENGINEERING AND ROWENTA HAS A GOOD REPUTATION. IT WAS A LITTLE PRICEY FOR ME, BUT HEY--I IRON EVERY DAY! AT FIRST IT STARTED OUT GREAT--NO DRIPS, GOOD STEAM, EASY GLIDING. THEN, IT BEGAN TO LEAK AND THE SPRAY FEATURE DIDN'T WORK [THE STEAM STILL WORKED] AND THEN ONE DAY, IT JUST DIDN'T TURN ON! I TOOK IT APART AND THE CONNECTIONS WERE ALL SOLID, SO WHO KNOWS WHY IT WENT ON THE FRITZ. I DO USE DISTILLED WATER AND I EMPTY THE RESERVOIR AFTER EACH USE. WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO ""OLD RELIABLE"" IRONS?????????? ANOTHER ANNOYING FEATURE OF THIS IRON IS THAT IT SHUTS OFF WAAAY TOO SOON, SO YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT TO WARM UP AGAIN. ROWENTA IS OVERRATED!"
5,Very Satisfied,"Does not spit or leak; VERY powerful steam action; can steam hanging clothes with the iron held vertically; glides smoothly; and is solid and well engineered.UPDATE: August 2010Earlier this year, the power cord failed at the point that it exits the handle (where it is receives the most stress). I had to open up the iron and cut off the bad portion of cord and reconnect it. Other than that, I've had no problems with this iron."
1,Leaks & Won't Shut Off!,"We purchased this iron after owning a Shark that lasted almost 5 years. We couldn't have been more disappointed. Within two months of owning this iron, it started to leak and sputter on our clothing. Then we noticed that the auto shut-off wasn't working at all. If we accidentally left it on, it never shut off! Even after unplugging the iron, it would take about ten minutes before it would shut down completely. As for the actual ironing - it works like an iron should. But it's not worth the trade off to spend $50 on an iron that spits, sputters, leaks and doesn't shut off. I've read up on Rowenta customer service and I don't think I'm even going to bother trying to contact them."
1,Not worth the money,"We use this iron about 3-4 times per week. I paid $50 for it and after only 3.5 months it is now not working well at all. The auto-off engages within a minute or two of turning on the iron. In order to disengage the auto-off I have to shake, rattle and roll the iron. I called Rowenta customer service and was instructed to mail the iron to their service center in Little Rock, AR. Turn around time? 2-4 weeks. I have to cover the cost of shipping. Rowenta is not worth the money."
1,Fire Hazzard,"Leaks, turns on and off of left plugged in all o the time. Surely a fire Hazzard pass on it."
3,Good basic guide,Went looking for a basic guide to the use of a fitness ball and this card deck fit the bill as a good suppliment to the basic DVD that came with the ball.
4,Offbeat Gem,"When the ""Montana Kid"" accidentally drifts across the Canadian border, the kindness of the small-town settlers he meets prompts him to reconsider the violence of his life. This little film is filled with wisdom and humor."
4,Entertaining,"I didn't know either star until I chanced upon this movie late one night. The movie was funny and entertaining. I looked up the stars afterwards, and I now have a major crush on Ms Guillory!"
3,Improbable dialog,"I am a fan of dramatic, plausible westerns. I was hoping this would be such a film, but it seems to be more of a spoof that illustrates improbable dialog employed under stressful encounters. It also excessively romanticized the gun and gunfighter. A little too much for my taste, although I could see how some would view the dialog in a humorous way, because it was so incongruous--so detached from the dramatic crescendo of conflicting encounters. Guess it depends on your expectations. For me, this film did not work."
4,ENTERTAININGLY FUNNY,"This Canadian movie was a rare delight. Set in the old west, it deals with the cultural differences between America and Canada as they may have existed at the time. Well written and wonderfully acted. Beautiful scenery and a great sound track. This movie will make you laugh out loud!"
4,Good SAFE fun for a movie,"Good solid humor, both physical and verbal. Not a ""classic western"", minimal violence, no nudity, limited cursing. I liked it well enough to order a copy to send to my parents."
4,UNCOMMON MOVIE,"Paul Gross plays a gunslinger, the Montana Kid in this near western. Paul reminds me of the Mel Gibson of yore, before he became Mr. Hyde. The Kid rides into town tied backward to his horse dragging a broken limb behind him. A young girl who speak-e English-e helps him down. The town graciously accepts him into their Canadian community, in spite of his uncouth ways. The general store doesn't carry a lot, but they can order stuff. It does have tea and escargot.He ends up living with a woman and helping her build a windmill for her well.It is a good movie. It is not a great western. It is not a great drama. It is not a great comedy. It spoofs the life of the old west and its ""codes."" No f-bombs, no nudity, no sex."
5,Love This Movie,"My family loves this movie! It's lighthearted and very funny, with touches of British wit and humor. Paul Gross is spot on; his talent as an actor allows him to believably morph into any character he portrays. The people of Barclay's Brush, totally unprepared to accept the ways of the ""American wild west;"" offer a chance for redemption to The Montana Kid through acceptance; genuine care and concern. For American audiances Alliance Films also brought us ""Due South."" A fine cast of supporting actors; Sienna Guillory, Callum Keith Rennie (the second Ray from Due South) Dustin Milligan and Graham Greene. I would highly recommend it's purchase; as just an overall good family movie."
5,Magic the Gathering meets Heroes of MM and AOW,"This is one of the few games this year that have kept me up until 3 AM just to play another turn. It is a near perfect union of heavyly Magic The Gathering inspired card play with fantastic 3D animated turn-based battles and Heroes 0f Might and Magic-inspired strategic campaign play. There are lots of creatures, spells, resources, and hero advancement with improving stats and skills. After you play a few scenarios or have fought about a dozen battles you will discover the subtle strategies involves in deck balance, exploiting your hero's strengths, and resource management (some of the high level spells are very expensive to cast). If you like MTG-type card games and love HOMM or AOW you will be in fantasy heaven!"
3,"Fun concept, but average game overall","I am an avid CCG player (ie Magic) and love RPGs and Strategy games. This game attempts to combine both in a Heroes of Might and Magic meets Magic the Gathering game. Its a good concept, but the game seems lack some originality as far as its ""card game"" portion goes. The game graphics are okay, but I was mainly interested in the turn-based gameplay. It got very repetitive quickly though. For me, its an average game that could not keep my attention -- however I like the game concept... hopefully Fishtank will try again and put more time into gameplay itself and will have a better product....."
5,Very good quality; good value,"I bought this tweezer set for model making and radio-control airplane construction and repairs. They are well-made and precise, and seem to me to be a bargain at the price."
1,Not what was described...,"Amazon was, as always, quick to ship and great with communication.I can't say that I was pleased with this product. The tweezer set I received is nowhere near what the image and description show you to be getting. The set was crudely finished and dull with no brand markings at all. The points of a few of the tweezers did not even remotely line up. I originally purchased these to replace a dollar store set, but these are, at best, the same quality as the dollar store set at a much higher price.I didn't expect anything near Erem quality tools, but I expected what was described on the site. What I received wasn't even close. I will be returning these."
1,poor quality tools,"I agree with another customer who gave this product one star. The picture on the website shows a set of quality-looking tweezers. This is not what arrived in the mail. The tools I received were poorly made and one of the tweezers was bent at the end. When I tried to straighten it, the tip broke off. DO NOT waste your money on this product."
4,Work well,"Work fine. I bought a similar set at a local store and they were junk, these have been working just fine."
5,Does the job...,"Like this very much, glad I got this style. The curtains move smoothly and don't ""catch"" while pulling along the rod, glad I got it!"
3,Modern Tour of Old Italy Hot Spots,Touring Italy is a good video for an overall review of Italy. It covered too much history which in my opinion should be reserved for book reading. Instead the video should have concentrated on the main attractions only. I would like to have seen more of Rome and Venice since those are the only places in Italy that we will be traveling.
3,"Good, but outdated","Similar to all of the other YDKJ products, this one is a real hoot. The only complaint I can come up with is concerning the time period of most of the questions. Being a young whipper-snapper playing these games is quite difficult, as close to 90% of the questions are before my time. I would definitely recommend this to adults that have a witty sense of humor and don't mind the sexual innuendo. (Not all content is suitable for kids.)And make sure you were born before the 70's or have a vast knowledge of older sports, movies, and television."
2,Not even remotely worth the asking price,"The only fun I've ever had playing any of the You Don't Know Jack games is in the dead of winter, drunk, and extremely bored. There is NO WAY this set is worth what is being asked for it. I 'might' pay $$$ including S&H if I had cash to burn. Just doing general browsing, I'm noticing that ALL collections of older Sierra games are way way way way way overpriced. Fairly warned be thee says I. You are a fool to pay what is being asked for these Sierra games. It's not like they clean your house or anything else super marvelous. Can anyone explain to me how this 3 game set of old trivia games is worth $$$ ? I just don't get it. But hey! if you want to .... your money, go for it."
5,Anthology,It's basicly an Anthology of World Literature after about 1500 C.E. including the Story of the Stone and Gullivers Travels as well as other works.
1,Poor Quality. THIN Fabric (almost see-through!). No Return Policy for Costumes!,"I purchased this costume almost 2 months before Halloween for my daughter. Her twin sister also got a teletubbie costume (Tinky-Winky = Purple) from another online costume retailer. This costume is Horrible. I can't imagine even putting her in it for Halloween. NOTE that this retailer DOES NOT Have a return policy for costumes!!! The costume looks like it is made of felt like cloth in the picture, but in fact is made with a VERY POOR thin cotton that STICKS to my 1 year olds body (who is only in the 10% for weight according to the doctor!!!). Don't Waste your money. Spend the extra $5 and get it somewhere else. I now have to purchase this costume from another retailer!"
3,Hard To Fill,"This grease gun does not take the mini cartridges of grease.You need to pack the grease by hand into the tube.The only way to do this without getting air bubbles is to pull the plunger rod downabout 3/4 of an inch at a time while filling it with a putty knife loaded with grease.The plunger rod will not lock until fully open so this is a 2 man operation to fill it.You can do it by yourself if you have a bench vise.I clamped the rod handle into a vise and pulled up on the tube while packing it with grease.Than locking it out fully so I could install the top pump section.If I was looking for another grease gun I would find one with a brake lever on the plunger rod.Once packed the grease gun works fine. With the price of mini grease cartridges being over $1.50 for 3 oz.I decided to pack the mini grease guns with bulk grease. I find that the mini grease guns are easy to use,and I prefer them over the regular sized grease guns."
4,Not too bad toy,"This toy is all right, but I've seen better. The arms moved, but the elbows did not. I found that the ""venus fly-trap"" on his head was detachable, and his knees didn't bend. The tail moved, and the head turned. I'd suggest getting this toy with another Ben 10 toy to increase the fun more than if it was the only toy you get."
5,Workhorse,"After a solid recommendation from ""My Sister, The Professional Artist"", I purchased this soldering iron for yet another reason not to do housework. The iron itself produces the steady high heat necessary for stained glass work and is perfectly complimented by it's stand. The rheostat is responsive, the cleaning pad is very handy and the wire holder is placed just where you need it. The $60 price is excellent for a tool of this quality and when needed, additional tips are readily available. Great equipment."
2,tip way too big,"This product says it comes with a 1/4"" tip, but it actually comes with a 3/8"" tip. Way too large for stained glass work. It's like doing brain surgery with a chain saw. Find something that has the right sized tip."
4,great iron,Great iron. Had to order 1/4 inch tip. Would prefer the iron come with that tip rather than the 3/8.
1,Dissappontment with purchase,"I have returned this item being totally dissatified. It is a 120 volt Unit and cannot be used either in USA or my country, Australia. Nowhere in the product description does it state that it is 120 volt.It cost me Aud. $41.00 to return it and Amazon has not had the decency to acknowledge that they have received it or advise me whether a replacement or a refund will be made.I advised Amazon 4 weeks ago that it was being returned and the reasons for that action, but so far no response whasoever."
2,Lots of heat available. Update,"All the watts you need for stained glass work. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that gigantic 3/8 inch tip that Weller includes with the iron. 1/4 inch is much more appropriate for almost all applications.After a month of use and about a pound of solder, I'm downgrading my original 4 star rating to a 2 star. The base station heat control unit has failed. The iron still works but only at the full 80 watts. I contacted Weller on the website today. Their reply and it's promptness will determine whether or not the unit maintains the 2 stars."
2,Tip Description is WRONG,"Just as hobbier said, the tip is LARGER than 1/4"".It is 3/8"" and way too large for the fine jewelry work I wanted to do. Boo!I also ordered a 1/4"" replacement which is not here yet....so I'll wait until that tip arrivesto see if it is actually that size or if I have to return all of it.I am returning it and have ordered theHakko Soldering Station, FX-888"
2,Blind Melon ripoff,I usually like G Love but I was really disappointed with this singles album. Did he really not think no one would notice that Hot Cookin's intro is a total rip-off of Blind Melon's Change??
3,A book of applied mathematics in cryptography,"I found the material included in this book to be an interesting collection of topics of applied mathematics in the area of cryptography. The book contains an admirable discussion of the stochastic views of cryptography. The material is by no means at the cutting edge of technology. However, it provides an adequate background for the novice reader in this important area of research. For me, the most interesting chapters were those describing information theory, tests for pseudorandom number generators, cryptanalysis, semantic security and birthday attack.I would urge that more attention to details and typographical errors is to be considered for future prints. As an example; the word ""und"" on page 78 seventh line!"
2,"Cute, but not packaged for shipping","I received this and was excited to have my 3 year old decorate it, but it was completely broken when I opened the box. The packaging was not adequate for retail, much less for crosscountry shipment! Amazon was great with the return, however, so we just had to postpone our decorating."
4,Lots of Fun,This kit is great. The hard part is done and the house is already assembled and all you have to do is apply the candy. This makes it easy even for the youngest child. The only negatives is we usually buy more candy because it doesn't come with enough and don't follow the directions for the frosting because it comes out too runny or too stiff.This is a family tradition and all the children gather together every year and make their own.
4,Great selection,"I sampled a few of the songs on this CD and loved it. Classics such as ""She Blinded Me With Science"" are timeless. Buy a copy and save for your kids to listen to when they reach thirty."
1,The title is misleading.,"This book does not contain any information whatsoever on the Bogomils. Without the front cover, there is no mention of the word Bogomil inside the book. If you are looking for information on the ancient Bogomils, look elsewhere, this book is a horrible peice of crap."
4,Most Excellent Companion to the Films,"This new book on Charlie Chan is not only a nice addition to the literature on the beloved detective and an excellent companion to the series, but it beautifully complements--rather than competes with--the classic CHARLIE CHAN AT THE MOVIES. These are the books to have on the Charlie Chan movies!"
4,At last McFarland comes through,"At last, McFarland comes through with a decent Charle Chan book. Kudos to Howard Berlin. McFarland's earlier Chan book by Ken Hanke was very disappointng. It averaged a major error every few pages. McFarland should consider retiring it now that the Berlin book is available"
3,"Chan Wars, Part Deux","Hanke's book has major errors, says an unnamed reviewer. Oh, please. There were mebbe 4 mistakes in the book, one a typo, one an ignorance of the language of a lost film, etc, and the other two so insignificant I can't even remember them! Hanke's writing can't be beat, and someone's got to be desperate to trash it in order to boost another book!"
3,Fairly decent,"The Chan encyclopedia is a fairly decent book. It eclipses the old, wayward Ken Hanke book. Both Berlin Hanke only examine the mainline series. Another new book, A GUIDE TO CHARLIE CHAN FILMS, also covers foreign Chan films and TV Chan, and it is well worth a look too since it the only one that gives an evaluative rating for each one. So there are a number of good Chan books out there now."
5,Charlie Chan Film Encyclopedia,A great film reference for every Chan and mystery film fan. Everything you want to know about the Chan films is here for easy access. Many pictures and helpful tables add to its value. Fun to read. Goes well with Mr. Hanke's and Mr. Mitchell's books on the Chan films. There can't be enough books about the Chan films. This one is a keeper! I hope Mr. Berlin writes more books on old mystery films and Chan.
2,There must be a better Edison book,"I stopped reading this book after about 150 pages, and resolved to find a better Edison biography. I had two problems with the book:1. The writing is a bit muddled. For example, we find Edison at age 23 running an ""invention factory"" with 50 or so employees housed in a four story building in Newark. There is almost no explaination of how he got the backing to set up such an enterprise.2. The author does not seem to have much understanding of the science behind Edison's work. He makes no attempt to explain how any of Edison's inventions operated - no diagrams or drawings, and he seems confused about the difference between electricty and magnetism.The author's background is in poetry. At the risk of sounding mean-spirited, I think that an Edison biography is not a good fit for him."
3,Edison the man,"In this biography of the great inventor, Neil Baldwin chooses to emphasize Edison the person rather than focusing on the inventions, as some earlier biographers had done. Perhaps for this reason, though the book is thorough, it reads somewhat shallow. Of all the inventions of Edison, Baldwin writes in detail only about 2 of them: the phonograph and motion pictures. He also spends a great deal of space covering Edison's work in the iron ore mine he owned in Ogdensburg, NJ, and his experiments with rubber, both of which produced negligible results. I found Matthew Josephson's 1959 biography on Edison to be much better."
4,Edison,"This book is very well researched. It is full of detail and you can't help but be inspired by the life of Edison and all the things he achieved. It is a little dry in style, but I'd say it's worth persevering with for that richer understanding of an ingenious, innovative man.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,BUCKETHEAD!!!,THE MIGHTY BUCKETHEAD DOES NOT LET YA DOWN. GOOD STUFF. ME LIKES. WILL PROBALBY END UP WITH MOST HIS ALBUMS THAT I CAN FIND.
5,No crime here,"Crime Slunk Scene has got to be one of Bucket's finest, depending on your personal tastes. If you really liked Electric Tears or Colma and are expecting some more of that, don't go here. This is Bucket at his slunkiest, with bizarre (how did he think of that?) yet genius compositions. The first 6-7 songs are over the top and belong on his all time best list. If you are a fan of guitar shredding, grungefunkification, out (way out) of the mainstream, then you will love this album! (After this I would recommend ""Monsters and Robots"".)"
5,Diamond Deb,Amazon connected me to the right company - nothing better than Diamond Deb Nail Files - cannot find them anywhere. Received product almost immediately - great service from both Amazon & company that sent the nail files.
2,Where is quality control?,"Diamon Deb nail files were just about as close as you could get to a perfect product: well designed, a great price, easy to find, and a pleasure to use.I didn't know why the new one I bought had a broken tip, a bad sanding surface, and didn't really file well. I thought it was a fluke, and bought another, even worse. Then I saw it was now made in China. Quality has gone down, noticeably.Definitely not the same product as the made-in-USA file. I wish I could find an old one on sale. I'd keep it forever. The new one, and the one I bought after that, just don't make the cut."
5,Grandmother's favorite,"My grandmother gave me a Diamon Deb when I was a teenager. I carried it for years and years in all of my travels. One day I lost it and was broken hearted. I searched beauty supply shops everywhere I went. One day on Amazon, I typed in Diamon Deb and there was my long lost friend. I have thin fragile nails and Diamon Deb has always been the best product for them. Thanks Diamon Deb and Amazon.com!"
3,Great Product - Shipping Rip-off,"These are excellent nail files. They last forever, unless you lose them. However, the vendor, Cache Beauty, charged a truly rediculous amount for shipping. $19.80 to ship a package that weighed a few ounces. The postage label on the box was actually $2.02. I call that a rip-off."
2,"Not like the ""old"" ones!","I purchased 3 files, one of each size, when I found them online. As other users have mentioned, they are not the same quality as the originals. They are thicker, stiffer, and do not have as fine a surface as the ones manufactured by the original company. I had my originals for over twenty years and would not have been looking if I had not lost them. These versions are ""OK"" as a file, but they are NOT what I was hoping for when I saw the name and cannot give me the same finish as my old ones. I will not buy these again. If I want a stiff, metal, grit-finish file... I can find them locally for a lot less."
2,Quality control is lacking,These used to be the best nail files ever. Not so now that they are made in China. Now they are rougher and have a tendency to snag the nails.So sad..still looking for a replacement.
3,Good but not as good as the originals,I purchased these items as my old Diamon Deb file is getting old (over 25 yrs now) but the new files are not a finely grained as the older one. They are still a good file but definitely not the same quality.
2,No comparison to her other books,"I like Kamila Shamsie as an author, and really enjoyed both Kartography and Salt and Saffron. This book simply does not compare with the other two. You get the feeling she's trying too hard to be witty, but it's pointless without a story that's interesting to read."
2,Blandnanarama,"For Bananarama completists only(both of you). The remake of ""More,more,more"" is a nifty dance tune but it's the only reason to own the album."
4,Stuff live at My Fathers Place in Roslyn,"They were a great band and gadd's drums sounded unbelievableChris Parker had left the band and it was probably one of the last times they played together Well...Maybe a few times at Mikell's, They cooked!!!."
1,Stuff it!,"Elevator jazz at it's worst, ESPECIALLY since these guys were monsters on their axes.What a disappointment!One of the guys who ran a jazz record shop in Berkeley in the 80's described it as fusak.The first time I ever heard it described as such,but it was dead on accurate."
5,Great...Stuff!,"I don't remember any band that sounds as good, as tight, as funky, as melodic as this one. Both guitarrists, Cornell Dupree and Eric Gale, have different and complementary styles. The bassist Gordon Edwards and the drummer Steve Gadd are one of the best duos of the 70's. And the late Richard Tee, genius of piano and organ, is the responsible for the harmonic and melodic inventions of this supergroup.This record worth every dollar."
3,Good and Bad,A slim solid player with many features .I returned it for a sandisk which has more battery power.
4,Good transaction,Received the product in a short amount of time and is working just fine. It's a good deal for the price.
4,As discribed,I really appreciated being able to get this book at a good price. The item arrived in great shape and on time.
3,A tedious read,"Could not get through the first 50 pages. To much emphasis placed on his own, in my opinion, boring stories & his belief in a higher power for motivation."
3,It's only 57 min long...,"Not only is it a mere 57 min long, it is poorly edited. I was hoping for so much more. Good information, but again, needed more ""stories"" to go along with it. It was like they had 45 min of info they stretched into 57, instead of 180 min edited down to a quality 57."
2,Not worth the effort,"Very little light emits from these and the one I did put up in a closet fell off the wall within less than 2 weeks. Not worth the effort, time or money."
1,"Nice tilt mechanism, horrible battery life","We wanted a ""moon"" light out on our pool deck to illuminate a wall clock while we were enjoying some candle-lit evenings. An old-fashioned moon light died (probably bulb), so ordered these. The tilt mechanism is good, helps to aim the light. But the light fades very quickly, after a few minutes, even on ""dim"" mode! Tried new batteries, and other pucks from the package -- same result. If you want 30-second light to help you find something in a drawer or closet, these might be ok. But if you want a low-level light that lasts for 30 minutes or so (and weeks before you have to replace the batteries), stay away from these, and go purchase a ""moon"" light from the local HW store for about $5."
1,Worthless,"Have installed two of these so far. They emit a faint, unpleasant light. On one, the contacts for the middle battery corroded--not because of the battery--and cleaning them did no good. Cheesy construction."
1,one light stopped working within a week,One of three lights stopped working within a week for no apparent reason. I will try to get it replaced using the warranty and update you on the result...
3,mfr.chico@att.net,"They work well, atrong light. One thing is if you use just the sticky back, they will fall, so were will use the screws. My hu is going to use rhw screws tonite."
3,Not super bright...,"I find these only OK. Not super bright and not very broad light. More of a focused type of light. I put these under a kitchen cabinet for cutting board lighting and wish they were not so narrow. They do the job, but..."
4,Good product,"A good product, well worth the price. Would have helped if it clearly stated the batteries were NOT included. Easy to install and shuts on/off as advertised. Does not really point the light in different directions, but angles it slightly."
2,Not bright,I was very disappointed by these lights. They seem bright ... until you mount them under the kitchen cabinet. They shine minimal light upon the counter top and were no help at all as task lighting in the kitchen. I'm now looking for replacements (non LED) and will mount these in closets -- where complete darkness will make them seem bright and helpful.
1,eats batteries and light produced is minimal,"Purchased these for under counter lighting, hoping that they would last for awhile, when left on. With new batteries, lights stayed on for less than 24 hours.I woulds advise purchasing only if you need to use them infrequently. Also, adhesive pads have all let loose when placed under counter. (purchased 15, so know it was not just a fluke with 1 or two)"
2,Pick Something Else,"Purchased these Puck lights for my craft closet that is without a light. When they got here I realized each one needed 3 AAA batteries, so I needed 9 total. Then I used the sticky stuff and stuck each to the wall. One stayed up, the other two did not eventhough they were against the exact same type of wall. One does not light a closet enough for my 20/20 vision. I have to have 2 on.So to summarize the bads - need lots of batteries, falls down instantly, you have to press it twice to get it to turn off, and when you press the thing it pivots and you have to move it back to the position you had it.Find a different press light - these are not worth it."
4,Nice little lights!,"As the other reviews indicated, these lights are very bright for their size. I had the old dome touchlights, and they drained batteries very quickly while emitting very low light. The new LED lights are a vast improvement. I can actually find items in my small closet now. I have only one complaint. One of the lights does not turn off completely, so the batteries will probably drain faster than the others."
3,"Work, but...","The lights work well, but they don't seem to stick well. I've had all three fall off the wall multiple times thus far."
3,Lights Work but There's a Sticky Problem,"The lights work fine and the hanging system should work but it doesn't. I found a workaround by NOT putting on the backing pads for hanging that are included with the product and instead using 3M Command strips to hang them. Of course, one could use the included screws but I didn't want to drill holes in my cabinets."
3,What a pain!,"I bought these lights to put under my cabinets in my kitchen. I first tried using the stick up method. But that didn't work the next morning the light had fallen down. So I got out my drill and drilled a pilot hole to screw them in. The problem w/ that was the screws are made of cheap aluminum and the head stripped before I got it tight. What a hassel! I then had to use pliers to get the screw out. As of this writing they are still not up. I'm either gonna go get some better screws or I might try my staple gun to secure the velcro. The screw would work if screwed into softer materials, but not hard wood. The lights themselves put off a lot of light and esp. nice w/ the 2 two light levels. But save yourself a lot of time...go get some good screws before you start!"
4,Great for under cabinet lighting!,"I ordered these Monday and got them Thursday....fast! I just put them up today and they are ideal for what I needed. I used them as under cabinet lighting in my kitchen so I can have a little extra light when I need it. The fact that I can turn and pivot these lights is wonderful! I'm crossing my fingers that the velcro will hold. I'll have to get shorter screws if I decide to permanently install them. I ordered two packs, so I have six lights and when I turn all the other lights off, they emit a bit of a blue hue. Also they are not bright enough to light up the whole room, but are definitey great for accent lighting or to use as I am. I plan on putting a ledge above my cabinets and will use these lights to accent the decor I put on my ledge. Will look great!"
3,not very brite,"The product came to my home in less then 36 hours of purchase. That was amazing. These lights arent very bright, but that most likely is just the nature of this type of lighting. As far as the company and its fast service I give it an A+... as far as LED lights (I used my lights for under the cabinet lighting in my kitchen) I have to give LED's a C-."
1,"Lights didn't last 100 hours, let alone 100,000","I bought these to go into my wifes curio cabinet. The intent was for the lights to stay on all the time. I put them in on Friday, by Saturday night they weren't working."
1,Dollar tree product just as good,Have had these for just under 30 days - am going to return items ( ordered 2 sets for under kitchen cabinets - problems encountered at this point1) ordered due to reviews saying actually stayed in place with adhesive mount - all 6 failed to stay mounted using adhesive mount2) have used for less than 8hours total on time and batteries already failing3) one light has developed a dark black area by one of the led lights4) screws that came with are made of cheap material - using a 9.99 battery operated black and decker screw driver resulted in head of screw being stripped in less than 1 minute - using manual screwdriver screws will not penetrate wood even if hole started with drillMy recommendation go to the nearest dollar tree and buy there - saves you about 15.00 and overall quality is the about the same
1,"Sorry, but not worth it.","I was so excited to finally have lighting in my closet, but unfortunately these will not stick to the walls with the sticky strips provided. I will probably end up drilling a hole to stick the light to the wall, but that wasn't what I hoped for when I bought them."
2,Low Light,Price was right but the amount of light produced was not enough to see my clothes in the closet.
2,Not much light,"These lights sounded good, but they put out such little light they are impractical for anything other than a faint night light. Better to get the arrays of LEDs for under counter lighting or lighting in general. Really, I can hardly see one of these in the dark."
2,Never again,"When I saw these light, I thought they would really be nice under my kitchen cabinet. After putting them up the light were just the right brightness I wanted, but after 6 hrs they die out(maybe it was the batteries that came with the light), I changed the batteries and they only lasted 4 days. The battery usage is way to expensive. I will be looking for some undercabinet lights that use electric."
2,Didnt live up to its promise,"I ordered this mainly to light up the dark end of my closet. It does give good/bright lighting, but the adhesive isnt that durable. I wasnt able to use it as much as I imagined at the time I bought it."
2,Dimmer than you expect.,"If, like me, you are purchasing these to light a dark space such as a closet, you are likely to find them far dimmer than you expect.Once my eyes adjust they sortof do the job but, basically, these provide a dim glow. They do seem to last a long time though. I once left one of them on all night and they are all still going strong well, as strong as they ever were."
2,Short battery life,I ordered these for a glass display case and have to replace the batteries daily. I went to using re-chargables and they barely last a day now.
4,Works,"The lights were a tad smaller than I expected them to be, but they are very bright.Two wishes for future product enhancements:Stickier back to stick to the wall.A dimmer setting than there is.Other than that, this is a great product, very bright, and helps me in my workspace at night."
3,LED Puck lights,"This is 3-pack of lights - each puck light has 5 lights operated by 3 AAA batteries. I'm not crazy about the bluish tinge that LED lights produce, but that is not a reflection of this product - it is an LED product. These come with 2 ways to hand them - by screw or sticky backing, both work well. They turn on and off with a push of the dome and dim once as well. These lights are easy to use and very handy if you need some light in a dark space. I would not recommend them for mood lighting in bookshelves or under cabinets - simply because of the bluish light."
2,Not very powerful,"I thought 5 LED lights would be enough under the counter top and in a closet, especially using all three pucks. It's not. They aren't very powerful and the adhesive won't stick on wood or paint. Unfortunate."
3,Not that bright...,"This ones are ok. I used three of them inside my closet (which is rather small) and they are ok, but they didn't light up the whole little room. I think they are more for giving light to something specific and close from them. They are very easy to install, although the tape that sticks them to the surface is not good and they fell after only a week. I am going to buy more of that double sided tape from 3M and I'm sure it would work. All and all for my case I would rather have installed another connection and have my problem solved and not half solved. I will post a photo later!"
2,These had potential but now it's just collecting dust,"I thought these would be really good in my closet. My closet is long and narrow with no light and lots of hard to reach areas. I thought these lights would brighten things up. They do, but for a couple days at most. Which is a real pain when you have to buy new batteries every week. Totally not worth it. Especially when the lights aren't even that bright and yet it uses up so much battery power. What a waste of money. =\"
3,Not as good as I expected,"Purchased the pucks to provide light in some of the dark corners of the kitchen counters. Just not enough illumination.Tried to use one in a closet, won't stick to the wall, though. Goes I have to use the screw.Would'nt buy again. Bought another brand (much more expensive)at Lowe's, were not any better.Returned to store. Guess I'll find some use for the lights from Amazon."
4,Focus Issue,"They weigh more than I expected, brighter than I anticipated. The only negative is they are pretty tightly focused with the light you get about a 1 foot bright circle of light at about 2 feet from surfaces. They are as bright as most led flashlights and focused similarly."
5,Excellent product,"This is one of those things that you buy thinking it will work great but at the end they work even better than what you expected. Easy to install, no trouble with the batteries, excellent pack."
3,ok but uses up battery FAST,Got these thinking that since they were LED that I could leave them on for prolonged periods. Did not work out that way for me. They drain the batteries rather quickly and the light grows dim. Now if you were wanting these for only light usage ie.....in a dark closed etc...they might works for you.
2,Do not stick to the wall as claimed,"I bought these lights for my closet. I was so looking forward to getting them. When they came in, I put the batterries in and glued them to the wall. Within 24 hours, they had all falled off the wall. I'm returning them."
2,design problem,"I bought these to mount inside a safe. The design problem is that each light has only one hole for a sensor and must pick up ambient light before turning on. If the sensor hole is not pointed towards adequate light, they will NOT come on which is a problem in total dark. I needed to have them mounted in a corner edge where the sensors would not activate. Too bad. They do put out enough light but couldn't get them to turn on when opening the door."
3,Easy lights,"These lights are easy to set up and operate. However, they are not very bright. I put three of them on a big closet; they light the place, but barely."
2,"very little light, battery life very short","Not expensive, but batteries are. If you leave them on for a few hours, you'll need to replace the batteries, and they take plenty.Figure out a way to get an electrician to put in 110v system, you'll be better off."
2,Nice style but doesn't work,"This puck light has nice styling, excellent adhesive option. I replaced the batteries 4 times and light never worked longer than 5 minutes. Light is very dim, might be useful in closed cabinet but hopeless for any other use. That is, assuming yours works long enough for you to find what you are looking for. I would have been better off saving the money toward a hard-wired puck lighting system."
2,Be aware.....No Batteries included!!!,"Son off to college. Needed this type light for Closet/Pantry area. Looked at a lot of offerings, made selection on the basis that batteries were included. Packaging pictures CLEARLY show 9 ""AA"" batteries in the blister pack. Ordered them, had send directy to son, he gets package, NO BATTERIES!!!!Ad is mis-leading!!! I easily could have purchased other offerings that said ""batteries not included"" for much less $$$$. Lights themselves are great, advertising is wrong and mis-leading."
2,Bright alright ...,"and easy to stay anywhere prefer. But the button is not as easy to press as I'd like it to. It also give a big clicking noise while pressing it. The biggest issue for me is that the batteries are hold overly tight, the one in the middle is hold so tight that I have to use a screwdriver to yank it out and causes some damage to the rechargble battery; truly awkward, bad design. Those gave good reviews probably have not replace their batteris yet ..."
1,Not enough light,"These lights provided very little light and did not illuminate the way the pictures show in the description. Despite the fact these are called ""white"" lights, they gave off the typical blue LED tinge which was awful and the light they provided was weak with little range (was like a spotlight). They are awful - avoid buying."
1,Horrible product,"The package showed batteries included. When I received my order, the batteries WERE NOT included. So, I had to purchase $16 worth of batteries on top of cost of the lights! Once they were installed, within two days, the lights began to fall from underneath the cabinets. The sticky tape is not very sticky at all. I suppose I will have to mount them with screws if I want to keep them up. Poor quality and the online picture was deceiving."
1,LED Waste of Money!,"Extremely disappointed with this product. When I received it I thought wonderful and attached the lights under one of my kitchen cabinets. They were bright and nice but the attachments failed and I had to stick them up with duct tape! However that has no bearing on my rating. It gets such a poor rating because 1 month after we ordered it, the brightness is almost zero. So I sent it back to Amazon and will never order another LED lighting fixture like this until there are major improvements."
2,Buyer beware...,"If you're ok with the bright white flourescent/dentist office/lightning white look, then this is your puck light. No, not halogen either. My mistake was thinking it was more a soft yellow light, but it's not. I'm stuck with the trio and it was all because I did not read word for word very carefully. For the money i guess it serves it's purpose of lighting a small area. BUT, it is not like ""lightbulb"" quality yellow...though more like flourescent stark white ....i'm just sayin'. I wish i could find some kind of filtered film i could peel and stick over it to soften the glow but I can't be bothered, to be honest. OH, one last thing: it took over 3 weeks to get here, so you can just imagine the buildup and let down."
2,Too little light,"Not to happy with these. The light is focused and not too bright and very white. For my use, they don't quite light up the pantry as I thought they would."
4,They work for me,"I am quite satisfied with these lights, particularly considering they were $8 for the set of three when I bought them. I use them near the bed in the middle of the night when I need some light but do not want bright room lights.They can be mounted with double stick foam tape which is included. The backing on this tape is a little hard to remove. But after a minute's work to remove it, the result was fine.For me, they would be handier if they only had two settings - on and off - rather than three settings - on/dim/off."
5,"If mama's not happy, ain't nobody happy...","We got these convenient, battery operated lights for my mom's kitchen, as she wanted a bit more visibilty in some of the tighter spaces in the room, like under the stove hood & under all of the cabinets. She couldn't be more pleased with the results. They are super easy to install, with no wires to clutter-up things. These Rite Lite Puck Lights are perfect for what mom wanted & she was thrilled with the exceptional bargain we got on them via Amazon.com.A win/win situation all the way around!"
5,Incredible!,"Nicely surprised! I was skeptical but upon inspection these are nothing short of fantastic, especially for the price. 5 super bright white LED lights on a main bulb which swivels to 3 places, has two dim settings, and a sticky back base to attach to most surfaces. Pleeeease avoid the similar looking, yet far inferior, lights from the infomercial which require an awful inconvenient magnet for them to work. Jus get these and don't look back."
2,The most short-lived lights in the world!,"I purchased these lights because for some reason, my kitchen has a complete lack of a stove/night light...and I despise the glaring overhead lights in the evening. So, when I put these up, I was thrilled! They offered just the right amount of light, and didn't run up my electric bill. However, after only about a week of use, they were all ""dead."" I figured it was my crappy batteries, so I ordered some higher quality ones...only to find the lights ""dead"" again after only a few days. Bear in mind that I didn't keep the lights on for hours on end--maybe an hour a day, a few days a week--at most. I had high hopes for these lights, but they just didn't deliver."
4,Good value for temporary/emergency lighting,"For the price, $17.95 for a three-pack, it's a good value. They can mount with either velcro pads or screws. The tilting/rotating mechanism doesn't allow a very wide coverage area. They use three AAA batteries apiece and work fine with NiMH batteries (still on the initial charge after four months of use). I don't think I'd recommend these for mood lighting or the like, but for temporary/emergency lighting, they're very serviceable."
3,"Sticky back fails, light falls, breaks","Every single one has fallen from the wall. The sticky stuff is bad, even against a smooth surface. If you screw them into the wall, they are good lights. They put out enough light for a small cabinet, such as a standing tool cabinet. If you can't screw them in, I would find another light or use a strong gel glue such as Loctite Super Glue GelLoctite 1363589, ULTRA Gel Control Super Glue, 0.14 oz"
4,RiteLite swivel lights,"This is a great little product for those dark spaces. I put mine (using the double stick option so as not to put holes in the walls) in closets. I have a great multi-cubby in which to store my shoes, but because the closet it dark, it is difficult to tell some of the darker colors apart--okay, they are stored according to color, but some of the navys are difficult to differentiate from the blacks. Super product for those small areas where light it needed."
4,Bright Idea,"Work great in my house, in my truck and outside on my Patio and by my BBQ. I even have a few extra velco pads up for moving them around."
4,"3 -pack, I just needed 2","They work great in the car, I put them up as reading lights. You push the center to turn them on and off. They take AAA batteries also. The adhesive tape isn't great. Industrial Velcro works best. Last problem, I have one extra just lying around, I wish they came in 2 packs.edit: after almost two years I can say that I have broken the retaining clips holding it to the interior of my truck. All three pucks are now just hand held flashlights..."
1,These things suck!,"These things suck!I bought these along with theSylvania 36008 DOT-it Self-Adhesive Bright White LED Light, Black, and there is hands down no comparison! The Sylvania is a litte more expensive, but worth every penny.When I got these lights, one didn't even turn on, and another won't turn on to the brightest setting.Also, they are bulky, and just feel kind if cheap. Get the Sylvania."
3,good but doesn't last to long.,good but doesn't last to long.after 1 day of constantly using it starts to get dimer
5,impressive,"This was one of my favorite collections, not just by Conway Twitty but by anyone. ""15 Years Ago,"" ""Hello Darlin,"" ""Julia,"" ""Desperado Love,"" and many others of his greatest hits are on this 2-disc collection. Any fan of Conway will love this, and it will make a fan of non-fans. It met and exceeded my expectations."
5,My family's yearly tradition.,"This CD has meant that Christmas is drawing neigh in my family for years. The beautiful and whimsical voice of Michael John Poirier has a unique sing-song loftiness that few others have produced through the years. After moving I have been unable to find mine and am about to buy it for the second time... that is how much I love this CD for the wonderful holiday season. His performance of ""O, Holy Night"" is absolutely brilliant!"
4,Sophisticated and smooth balladry,"If you want to get in the mood...light up the candles and get cozy and get this magnificent music going. What more do you need than classic alike ''Contigo Aprendi,'' ''Somos Novios'' and ''Adoro. Mellow but melodic rhythms that become timeless in allure and yet stir fresh emotions each time you go back to listen again and again. This is a best-of-genre CD for anyone's library! Nancy M."
5,"Simple, delicious mix of tea","We stock the tea and coffee shelf at our offices every fall with a diverse, eclectic assortment of products for employees to sip on throughout the chilly Utah winter. So far, this blend of teas from the last round purchased from Amazon is disappearing very quickly. Based on usage, we will reorder this product again in the near future!"
3,"For the card player, not the manipulator.","I got a 12 decks of these a while back and was satisfied at first with them. However, if you do any kind of card manipulation or card magic, you will find these unsatisfactory. They have an interesting finish that seems to grab dirt as soon as they our out of the box. After about ten minutes of handling, they will not fan well anymore, and they don't ribbon spread well at all. Certain sleights become far to obvious with these. I also play poker and I suppose if all you do is play cards, you may not have any issues with these. The price looks good, but when you tack on shipping it quickly adds up. I would recommend going to your local Costco and picking up some Bicycles for about the same price."
3,Heard on TAL,"I heard a piece on this American Life and decided to buy the film. After all, the radio show convinced me that this would be great. Dan Elfman created the music - thought this would be excellent.Slow is more like it.It takes great pains to show how the film was developed, how they picked it apart, and the impressionable soldiers working there.I watched a good 90 minutes. It felt like 5 hours.The subject interests me. And at times I found it worthwhile. Just got bogged down and didn't enjoy it much."
3,Why Barry Williams?,"A decent effort by the Wiggles and producer Paul Field. This is my least favorite of the Wiggles' Christmas efforts. Music is almost too flashy, and, quite honestly, I fail to see why anyone in their right mind would want Barry Williams (Greg Brady) headlining any of their artistic endeavors. Still, a fun listen on the road with the kids."
5,For Newbies & Dablers,"I highly recommend this product for newbies and people who have been dabling and just can't get into the 500 page books on technical analysis. Its testing at the end of each section, helps reinforce the subject covered, and if you are honest with yourself, you will re-review the information until you get a passing grade."
1,Mac compatibility,I purchased this item with high hopes only to return it because it would not load on my mac powerbook. Is there a mac version available?Thanks in advance for your input.
5,An Introduction to St. Theopan the Recluse,"As a first introduction to the writings and teachings of St. Theophan this book is excellent.It covers not only the main events in St. Theophan's life, but also interesting details of his form of monkhood, of his vast correspondence, and a general presentation of his writings concluding with a sound study of The Way of Salvation, his main book.Those who want to study St. Theophan's writings further will have many thousands of pages to enjoy!"
5,Twentiety century hero,"""Restavec: From Haitian Slave Child to Middle Class American"" is the biography of a man who endured an heroic struggle with fate even more daunting than that of Shackleton at the South Pole in 1914-15. Caudet did not choose to be born into the cruelty and abuse to which he was subjected, yet he endured his ongoing trials with an indomitable spirit which would undoubtedly have broken most of us. Shackleton sought his adventure to the Antarctic, took calculated risks, and rose above the challenges to rescue all of his men and return them to civilization. Jean-Robert Cadet did not choose his childhood, in which he was essentially alone, unloved, abused and neglected. By force of his own will, he matured, learned to love and be loved, and is a citizen in our society toward which he has every right to feel an uncontrollable anger. You cannot read this book without wishing you could be the loving and proud parent he sought."
4,"Sad story, but still happening in Haiti today",I visit Haiti fairly regularly. This is one man's story but still occurs on a regular basis in 2009
2,Walk a mile in these shoes!,"Restavec is required reading for anyone interested in human rights literature. With this moving book, Jean-Robert Cadet takes his place among other authors of this genre such as Irina Ratushinskaya, Eugenia Semyonovna Ginzburg, Natan Sharansky, Vaclav Havel, and Elie Wiesel. The book give new meaning to the proverb about walking a mile in another man's shoes. I think the book is also invaluable for understanding something about post-traumatic stress syndrome. Cadet's account of his childhood and subsequent life in the here in the United States makes an excellent companion book to Disposable People, by Kevin Bales (University of California Press). One can only hope that writing Restavec was part of a healing process for Mr. Cadet."

2,Eye-opening? Yes. Moving? Yes. Literature? Barely.,"I certainly share the views of many of the prior reviewers with respect to the revelatory nature of this book. As one who is married to a Haitian, and is just now exploring various aspects of the culture and history of that nation, it was quite an eye-opening read. Mr. Cadet is to be applauded for his courage and tenacity, as well as his willingness to share excruciating details of a terrible upbringing for the benefit of others. That said, the publishers should be ashamed to have allowed this book to print without even the most basic editing. Strapping together a bunch of episodic remembrances and anecdotes does not a book make; especially when topics of slavery, humiliation, rascism (in Haiti and the U.S.), and abject abuse are involved. Mr. Cadet's story deserved better. As for the reviewer who compared Mr. Cadet's talent and/or potential to Nabokov, I would invite that person to actually read Nabokov sometime."
5,Shades of Pearl Buck and of Vladimir Nabokov...!,"Jean-Robert Cadet has written a captivating, soul-wrenching,mind-boggling autobiography. I was unable to put down till I had read it in one sitting! When the pages of RESTAVEC began to unfold ,I realized that this author has the potential to follow in the footsteps of Pearl Buck and Vladimir Nabokov.Hats off to Mr. Cadet."
3,Batman costume,"The costume was great b/c my son loved it. It fit well, although the material was chintzy."
1,Does not work as advertised,The unit only has a range of 15' total. I tried two units and still could not get it to work.
3,Why Not Just Give Your Kids the Best,"Obviously much effort has gone into this but the Harry Potter books are a much better read, particularly for children."
5,Enchanting.,"This book is like a surrealist's painting. Sometimes twisted, sometimes magical, and always mystical. It is such a good story, it had me pinned to the sofa for hours. This story has it all: fantastic swordfights, magical journeys, grusome monsters. WOW!"
5,I loved it!,"The Nights Wyrd is about a young man named Will who is looking for his wyrd (destiny). On his way he encounters many enemy's such as a man eating Troll, carnivorous Mermaids, and an invincible Ogre. It's a lot of fun and adventure. If you like books with action then you should read this book"
2,Slow and problematic,"We have had a Microtek Scanmaker i800 for several years. It has great color and D-max. BUt we needed a doc feeder. So we bought this model, assuming a somewhat similar quality and speed would be encountered. WRONG! This unit has a constant banding issue (rainbow stripes appx. 0.5"" from the feed edge) and is very slow for an ADF unit."
2,Vista Users - RUN AWAY!,"If you just upgraded your computer and it's running Microsoft Vista, go look at a different brand of scanner. I made the mistake of buying this one just before upgrading to Vista, and after months of promises of Vista drivers from Microtek, they've recently decided not to provide Vista drivers for this one."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this with the intent of using to help divide mailing lists by sales territory. However,I soon realized that it defines zip code areas by the first three digits only, i.e. 640, 641. This was helpful, but not nearly as much help as a five digit breakout would have been. If you need a five digit breakout, buy a wall map."
5,Excellent,"I love the writing for this episode. It keeps me guessing as to who the perp is. When I think I know..they find another suspect, then another..until I'm not quite sure. I love to be surprised."
4,tv still has good shows,"watched all 3 seasons 3 times, love this show especially kiele sanzhez, has good writers and story lines, my question will it be back next season?"
5,Great Glades!,"I was very glad to see this series available on Amazon. I enjoyed the first two seasons of ""The Glades"" and was able to watch all the third season without annoying commercial interruptions. Well worth the season price. Matt Passmore is awesome!"
1,Major problem with streaming in entire season,The streaming to my TV stalls continuously and is constantly reloading. I haven't been able to watch any of the episodes without this occurring. I purchased the entire #rd season and can't watch it. A waste of money
2,Good show,Love this series. Best way to watch without comercials. It ends with a cliff hanger so can't wait for season 4.
5,Love the show and Your service!,Igrew to love the Glades series as the characters develop and grow together. But the thing here is how easy the Amazon Vid on Demand service is --The quality of the delivered product--Amazon customer service-if it's needed is great. I do wish it was profitable for you to have a subscription service like the Netflix format-because it seems like you have more content then them faster and as much or more content then iTunes. Also-your HD vids play without any problem on my PC desktop or my MacBook Pro. Not so with iTunes. So that's my two cents worth.
4,The Glades season 3,This season of The Glades is worth the money. We tend to watch multiple episodes each day. Its pretty good.
3,Fighting Food,"Not bad. Still belong to team Callie! Enough with sexual tension while she's gone. Need more,bizarre, off the wall stuff. Not X-Files just weird,small town stuff."
5,The Glades Series,I really like this show. I like the main character. I think the actor who plays the medical doctor is funny. I like the new female partner that he has. I wish his girlfriend was a little different but that the character that she has to play. I can't wait for the next season to come. I am so glad that the show is on when the main channels are repeating there series.
5,The Glades,"love this series, Jim Longworth is my hero, such great chemistry between the characters, great mysteries and comedy at the same time."
1,not really entertaining.,This book lacks the drive to make page per page exciting to read. It's not worth your money and I wasted mine. So sad.
2,not what you think,"This cd is not what you think. It contains 2 versions of ""New Shoes"" and that's all. No other songs, nothing. Not worth the price."
5,Excellent Earplug,"Last year my husband bought me a box of 200 for my birthday. I love them. This year I'm buying 2 boxes of 200 for myself. I wear these at night to help me sleep, during the day to blunt the sounds around me, and especially at the movies where everything is so loud these days. Not all sound is muffled out. I still hear lot of things and can carry on a conversation if I'm paying attention, but it makes enough difference to make previously intolerable things much more tolerable. If they don't seem to work at first, I suggest trying to insert them different ways. Some work better than others. I suggest them for anyone who seems to be extra-sensitive to sounds."
5,3M tekk Ear Plugs,"3M tekk disposable ear plugs work well, are comfortable to wear and inexpensive. I wear them primarily when riding my motorcycle. It keeps the road and exhaust noise to a minimum and keeps the wind out of my ears. Very good product."
1,Piece of garbage,"I just got a whole box of the ear plugs. Tried a pair on, an it is a piece of garbage. The texture of the ear plug is hard and hurts theear.I rate this a zero, since the whole box of ear plugs are going into the dump right away. Worst set of ear plugs that I have ever tried, and would definitely stay away from these."
2,Predictable,"This book contributes to the reason I usually stay clear of ""young adult"" novels. The book is too predictable and the story has been written one hundred times before, and much better. Although, the author is a teenager and still needs time to grow and develop her writing skills. In the future, she just might come out with something original and worthwhile but right now, if I were you, I'd skip."
1,Did not work at all for me.,"I used this product as recommended. I used all three bottles, spent a lot of money on them too, and my skin did not improve what so ever."
3,"... but it doesn't have ""Space Cowboy""","This doesn't have Space Cowboy (not ""The Joker"" which mentions the same phrase). This is a hit song of theirs which any compilation should have. I suggest getting the 2 domestic greatest hits albums (68-73 & 74-78) instead."
5,Enhance your SMB collection,"Not only is this Australian collection an excellent overview of the Steve Miller Band's 30-year career, but it features five essential tracks that are not found on the American release ""Complete Greatest Hits"":Give It UpKeeps Me Wondering WhyHeart Like A WheelTrue Fine LoveWinter Time"
5,Excellent in every way,"I was a student of this author, a professor at the U.of MN, for a social work course on brief therapy strategy.His expertise and common sense way of dealing with involuntary clients is groundbreaking.Dr. Rooney uses direct partnering of clinician and client to empower the client.He finds a way to serve the client exactly where they are willing and interested in being served. This makes it possible for even the most intractable, reluctant client to be capable of growth and change.A sample exchange might go:""Well, since you are mandated to attend this therapy,and you do not want to be here. What are you actually interested in? How can we make this time work for you?""This is a work of practical genius.Anybody working in human services, even any parent, can benefit from this work."
5,A Style Council feast !!!,"A delightful feast for your senses. This box set has it all, and Im not rating it based on quantity. TSC produced fine music, will please any discerning listener. If you like TSC, do yourself a favour and take the time to get to know their stuff (this box set is the way to go). TSC dabble in many different genres like rock, britpop, jazz, soul/funk and even classical with so much finess. I love it anytime, and its great music for parties too. Pretty damn groovy! Rita"
4,Reel Love by Glenn Paul,"This is basic straightforward piano music, playing some familiar movie-theme tunes. There are no other instruments, just the piano. I enjoy it a lot, and have worn out the cd, listening to the soft sounds in the car or on the computer. I gave it four stars instead of five, because some people might not prefer the simple (dare I say sparse) arrangements. Carmen Cavallaro, this is not. There are no technical passages on display. As a very novice piano player, I get the feeling one could duplicate the arrangements with the sheet music and a little practice. That is part of the appeal, I think."
4,"""...Drunk"" tests the limits again","""Is it junk?"" No, not at all, Neil. The Boys break out the rhyming dictionaries and test the limits of our patience again, but in a friendly sort of way, as always. File this under R for ""Ridiculously Lengthy Song Titles"", or T for ""Tender yet forceful"". The songs rhymey-chimey cuteness would strike us as sophomorish coming from anyone else, but the ""Shameless"" Pet Shop Boys can get away with it. This is one of the best selections from the album Nightlife."

1,What a rip off!,"I cannot believe I paid $15 for this horribly recorded live CD. ""Live at the Turning Point"" should be given away as a bonus for buying his next studio CD, not sold as a stand alone CD. The sound reminds me of bootlegs recorded when a bootlegger snuck a tape recorder in his pants.I am a fan of Willie's and own all of his CDs, but I am very disappointed with this release."
2,Protocol-17,The e-book I received was a partially edited piece with many of the editor's comments in parentheses and some lines in yellow over liner. There were many mispelled words and incorrectly used words. The work was the raving of a sophmore english major turned loose with a thersarus. I expected better of Amazon. Don't buy this piece of junk!!
1,Waste of time,"I just wasted $16 on what I thought would be an interesting tale, a la Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons. This book was presented in such a form that it seemed to be written by a high school sophomore and edited by a junior-higher. Spelling and grammatical errors abound in this debacle. I should have known when I didn't recognize the publisher's name that this book was a farce. But I hoped with the interesting tagline and exciting plotlines that it would hook me. Unfortunately I can only make it through 120 pages. That said, I will now relegate this garbage as my new drink coaster. Wow, a $16 coaster, that's sad. Please, if you have any literacy at all, DROP THIS BOOK IMMEDIATELY and buy something from Caleb Carr or Peter Straub."
1,"This is the exact same book as "" Dark Protocols"" .....","""Protocol-17"" by Douglas Weber is the exact same book as ""Dark Protocols"" by Richard Weber!!!!!!!I guess if you try to sell a really BAD, BORING, not even the author knows what he's trying to say kind book and it doesn't sell, just change the title, change the artwork, change the author's name and try again!!!!!!!Now THAT is a conspiracy!Possibly the worse book I have ever read, and I do read a lot, 15 books in the last 6 months, including ""The Da Vinci Code"".Whomever compared this author with Dan Brown, Koontz, King and Eco, must have read a different book or is a friend of the author or publisher.Also notice the double entries of the reviewers! Again, friends of the author perhaps?"
2,Hose Hanger,This hose hanger looks nice but very difficult to hang. I would not get it. We ended up buying a cheaper much simpler version from Ames. Not as nice but much easier to hang.
3,A reprint of a 1898 book,This is a poor quality reproduction of a book published in 1898 and will only be of interest if you wish to learn about railroad signaling before then. Obviously it has no information on developements in the past hundred years.
1,commentary and introductions are against the Faith,At the beginning of nearly each book of the Bible in this version the commentators either cast serious doubt on who the author is or state outright that the author is not who tradition holds it to be .They state that in the Gospels only very short quotes of Christ are authentic and that all longer ones are the author putting their teachings in Christs mouth to give them authority. They also state that many of Christ's miracles are simply taken from the Old Testament and attributed to Him to make Him seem Divine.It would take a entire book in itself to cover how contrary to sound Faith this version is .The entire approach of the commentators is point by point directly condemned by the Pius X encyclical Pascendi Dominici Gregis as heresy .Shame on the Catholic Book Publishing company and every person involved in this dreadful version .
3,"Bear cub toy, one only","Figure is ok toy, but I was expecting one small and one large, because that is what is pictured!"
4,magic review,i love this cd but it is so very hard to understand robert throughout most of it. I have that problem alot. The accent makes it quite difficult. However I do reccomend it if it ever becomes available again.
4,Good reading for history and aviation enthusiasist,"I recommend this book for everyone interested about Vietnam war and military aviation from human perespective. You can almost feel the pulse and sweat of the author, when going 500 MPH towards the trouble, and all cathc-22 frustrations of war, which indeed were plenty if only half were true!However, be warned that this book is a bit thick on military and aviation acronyms, radio comm etc. and this by a rated private pilot."
5,One of the finest books on air combat,"Once you start this book, you better have some spare time because you will not be able to put this book down. As an avid air combat reader, I'd say this is a great easy read. Informative for the layman and expert."
4,Kindle edition-spelling erros,"The book is great, but sadly their are numerous spelling and formatting errors in the Kindle edition, which is ridiculous considering it is actually more expensive than the paperback version"
5,Amazing account!,"The author spares no details in his raw account of life in a thud squadron during the Vietnam Conflict. He is true to the feelings experienced going to war and the fear involved with putting your life in danger day after day. He offers unique insight to the mind of a fighter pilot as he rolls in on a target for a bombing run, and the reader feels completely engaged as if he/she were in the cockpit too. Overall, this is highly recommended for aviation enthusiasts or history buffs looking for an expanded knowledge on this often forgotten era of our nation's history."
3,F-105 Pilot,"I read the short version of this e-book ""When Thunder Rolled: An F105 Pilot over North Vietnam"". I am planning to order the full version next month as the book seems to be very exciting."
3,"Great in 2001, okay in 2006","I LOVED this book. My family and I travel Maine each year and this book is THE guide (along with the Maine Atlas). It has helped us refine our experience in Maine to a very satisfying level.The guide to natural sites/walks/boating is still wonderful.However, if you've been to Maine before, you know that businesses come and go with alarming rapidity. This is especially true in the Eastern Coast. Most of the restaurants listed in the guide are long gone or under different managements, so don't count on finding a place to eat based on this guide."
5,Priceless!!,"This book is fabulous. I work as a travel nurse and recently spent 6 1/2 months in Maine. I had never been there before and spent several hours at the bookstore going through various Maine travel books before settling on this one. I certainly made the right choice. It was a wonderful resource. I spent hours reviewing the information in this book over the course of my time in Maine. I plan to go back to Maine next summer and will take my book right back with me. The information on shops, restaurants and points of interest was valuable and very accurate."
5,Nicely illustrated,"This 77-page booklet has many photographs and drawings plus cut-aways of Pompeiian architecture. The author covers a lot of territory discussing the disaster of Vesuvius, discovery and excavation, streets and water supply, the people and their homes, public and private baths, commercial life (bakers, bars, taverns, etc.) and much more. The detail is amazing. Highly recommended."
2,Why read this when there are more disciplined books?,"Imagine someone took the Ten Commandments and tossed in some of his own commandments, and published it; of course, it would have some GREAT parts, but it would lend authority to the author's additions which they don't deserve.Yes, he includes the venerable rules of programming style, as laid out by the classic authors, then tosses in some of his own that are self-indulgent and provincial. Good luck to a beginner trying to sort them out.Pulling rules out of thin air makes you an autocrat, not an authority. Get The Practice of Programming, Code Complete."
2,Read Code Construction instead,"Read McConnell's ""Code Construction"" instead. Covers the same ground, but better, more informative, and less opinionated. Nothing wrong with opinionated. Just that Holub tends to present his views as the de-facto best practice when other views are just as valid or more valid. He tends to neglect any supporting reasons for his views. For instance, his section on tab stops (""40. Use four-space indents"") presents the following reason logic: a) 1 space indents are unreadable and b) 4 space indents are ideal. That's it.What this book is, is a codification of Holub's prejudices regarding writing C & C++ code. I agree with most of them personally. In fact, he's the only coding style writer I've seen that agrees with me on some, but nevertheless this appears to be simply a vanity book in style and substance.McConnell's book is more thorough in style and substance, even if I think he's wrong in many cases."
1,Don't waste your money,"I didn't even want to award it one star! Extremely disappointed in the content and quality of this show. I was hoping for vignettes of Victorian life during this festive time of year, instead all I got was still photos, a boring condensed reading of, ""A Christmas Carol"", plus other useless factors, which I could have picked up more cheaply by surfing the web. If you are interested in Victorian Christmases, may I recommend, ""A Child's Christmas in Wales"". That is much more entertaining and worth your money."
5,The best there is.,"The third edition of this masterful book on creating underwater images has expanded to incorporate the burgeoning world of digital photography.Martin takes the student beyond the mechanistic approach of F stops and shutter speeds to pare image making down to its essentials. His TC system enables the photographer to hone their ability to recognise good photographic opportunities underwater and to more fully exploit the potential they offer.If you want to improve your images, this is the book for you."
3,Electronics Drafting,The exercises were challenging but full of errors. Some tables were incorrect as well. To successfully complete the Activity exercises required knowledge explained in later chapters. Hopefully the necessary revisions will appear in the next edition.
5,Un libro excelente de leer,"Como musico cristiano siempre he buscado saber mas de los adoradores que Dios ha puesto entre nosotros. Marcos Witt explica en este libro como se dio su llamado, todas las cosas que paso para llegar a ser lo que es. Lo impresionante de el, es que dice sus errores. El poder reconocer sus errores como lider dice mucho de el. Marcos Witt cuenta su vida, lo bueno del libro es que el habla con el corazon, menciona muchos de sus suenos, conflictos y errores como lider, y sus grandes logros que solo fueron alcanzados con la ayuda de Dios. Los muchos consejos que el da en su libro son por los años de experiencia que el tiene en la ministracion. Creo que este libro es un libro que ningun musico cristiano involucrado en el ministerio de la musica debe de omitir. Marcos Witt a sido el hombre que Dios a usado en traer una frescura a la adoracion y alabanza en Mexico y en todo Norte, Centro y Sur America sin la meno duda."
5,Excellent Keyboard,"Got it about a month ago, works great, nice and sturdy. Good size keyboard, bear in mind it will be very large, so I do not recommend using this in a tight space. The USB ports are a nice touch."
5,Great,"I am very happy with this keyboard. The ""G"" keys are great for macros and the media buttons I use now that I have them. No complaints about this keyboard yet."
4,Review of Logitech's G11 Gaming Keyboard,I found the G11 keyboard to be perfect for what I was looking for. The feel of the keys is good and there are plenty of macro keys to use.
3,"Nice idea, but poor construction","The layout of the keyboard is great, the LCD panel is wonderfully useful, and the extra programmable keys are awesome.However, some construction flaws make this keyboard pretty disappointing. The keysdo not have uniform tactile response. Some keys jam or stick unless you depress them perfectly vertically. The backlight has 2 brightness settings, both of which are far too dim to be useful. And the fold-out legs on the bottom of the keyboard are flimsy and too short. If you want your keyboard to be at an angle, you have to prop it up on a book or something.A much better choice is the Saitek Eclipse II, although it doesnt have the extra programmable keys or the LCD."
3,G11 is ok if you need a cheap good gameing keyboard,Well the G15 v2 2007 is only about a few bucks more. so if you need a keyboard and dont have enuff this would be your best replacement option. But the G15 is better.
2,keyboard started glitching within 8 months,"My G15 keyboard started glitching within 8 months of purchase, my Enter, K, and I keys were the 1st to go, then keys started double typing and when I contacted Logitech's customer support they had me hook it up to a 2nd pc without there software. I hauled the keyboardinto work and hook it up (what a pain!)and yup the keyboard is junk.Logitech's customer support had me fill out a bunch of info but I didn't have my receipt so I'm out my 80$, I went back to my old keyboard, its 10 years old and still works perfectly!Logitech should be ashamed of them selves for selling substandard products at inflated prices! No matter how many bells and whistles a keyboard has it should last longer then 8 months!"
4,G11 keyboard,"The keyboard G keys are non functional in certain PC Games.I also use it for text,letter writing and macros.I love the lightedkeyboard, what ever you do purchse a lighted keyboard.Overall if your not a gamer the G11 saves lots of time.I purchased it for a good price,so I can't complain.I see that logitech has come out with newer game keyboards."
5,Great Keyboard for a Great Price,I generally use my computer with low level lighting. My wife and I game together. The added functionality of the programmable keys plus the back-light make this keyboard ideal. I have had them for a couple of weeks. Love them will buy again.
1,I wish I saved my money!,"I'm embarrassed to say the 20 dollar stock keyboard that came with my computer outlasted this hightech over priced piece of computer hardware. I had mine for a whooping total of 5 weeks before it bit the dust.The main issues I had with the keyboard are this.1. The backlit keys only look good on the box. In reality they are very very dim! Don't think you'll be typing in the dark so well.2. The Construction is very Cheap! Heavy bulky plastic and I could never get the audio buttons to work!3. It broke on me! At first just half the board stopped lighting up, then a few keys stopped responding, and then it bit the dust all together! It now sits as a reminder of the money I wasted. I'm back to using my old Dell keyboard with candy,lint,crumbs,dust,and soda spilled all over it. This thing dies hard! It's missing 2 keys and it still keeps on going!Lesson learned!"
2,Nice until it broke,"The good points of this product have been touched on in other reviews. I will not rehash them here.I owned this keyboard for approximately 3 months. It operated well, although I did have problems with the amount of desk real estate it required - it is a large keyboard. This is a minor issue, however. The main problem I had is that one day the number keys refused to work. It isn't a software issue, as I've tried it on other computers with no success. I've owned other Logitech products and they are nice until they break after a few months. I've bought 2 headsets, this keyboard, and a mouse that periodically glitches on me from Logitech. With the shoddy performance I have experienced I can't recommend their products to anyone."
5,Great keyboard,"I got this because it had the lighted keyboard pad, other reviews on other products did seem to do as well. I have had mine for i think four or five years now. Everything works well on it. Only draw back is some of the letters on the keys are deminishing, wish there was a way to just buy on key needed. I utilize the usb ports in it, which has come in handy."
5,Great Product,"Before I purchased this keyboard I heard and read reviews about how shoddy and problematic Logitech keyboards could be. I would just like to say I have never had a single issue with this keyboard. I have been using it for 3+ years now. The lights still light, the keys are still smooth and precise when typing, and the macro keys are infinitely useful and easy to program. Recommend very highly to anyone who uses their computer constantly for work or for gaming. Very ergonomic and looks totally bad-ass to boot."
2,Wasn't too happy with this keyboard,"I got this keyboard thinking it would help me with shortcut keys to my games. The problem was that it didn't work for most of my games.Also, it's only 10 months old and the ENTER key had stopped working. I had to use the ENTER key from the number pad. It got to be a pain so nowI'm using one of my old keyboards again.I would not recommend this keyboard to anyone.I did like how it lit up but that was the only thing I liked about it."
4,Thumbs up,"Generally happy with this keyboard.Good backlighting, macro (G) keys are easy to use. Keys are a bit closer together than my old keyboard, but didn't take long to get used to the layout.Only real minus is that the ESC key is badly placed.Would really like this keyboard in a wireless version."
2,Driver issues...,"The keyboard is good in most respects as other reviewers have noted, but I've been having problems with it ever since I installed the drivers.I run Windows 7 64 bit edition and I suspect the drivers may be conflicting with my system. About once every 3 minutes or so everything ""locks up"" - that is the mouse and keyboard do not respond as the computer is hanging on something. This only happened after I installed the drivers for the Logitech G11 keyboard. A workaround I've been using is to enter control panel and kill the 3 processes related to the keyboard. Interestingly, the volume dial and audio controls appear to be unaffected by killing those processes. Odd. Also, the macros still work fine without the processes running. So, although I am happy with many features of the keyboard, I'm disappointed that there appears to be some sort of driver conflict that causes system hangs. I wonder if anyone else is having these problems with a 64 bit Windows 7 machine..."
4,"Excellent Keyboard, but a bit pricey","Honestly, a great keyboard. Kind of pricey, but I have been using the nice ""older"" model keyboards. While it doesn't have the same sound, it doesn't matter in the least, as my WPM go up by around 20 to 30 by using this keyboard versus a laptop keyboard, or those terrible ""cheap"" microsoft keyboards.The lighting is absolutely genius on this keyboard; you have the option to turn it OFF.I will note that this thing is a dust magnet. I would wholly recommend buying a cover when you're not using it.Tacky? Maybe, but you'll save yourself some trouble in the future.This would get a 5-star review if it didn't cost so much."
4,Logitech G11 Gaming keyboard,"I really like the layout and extra buttons for gaming, the only thing is that it is too wide to fit under my desk and now I cant hide the keyboard tray. Once you go to a back lit keyboard, I can't see how you will ever not have one again. I may upgrade to a shorter version in the future but it will DEFINITELY have a back lit keys.Very nice tactile feel on the keys themselves and much better than any other Logitech keyboard where the keys felt a little mushy. I would recommended this to any WOW or other games that require 1 button to cast spells and such. 18 extra buttons give you a lot of flexibility."
4,Enter Key stopped working after 14months,"The action of the left crtl key was always strange - it seemed 'notchy'. This was ok - I would have given the keyboard 4 stars based on that. However, after 14 months, the enter key stopped working. Sure, there is another enter key on the numeric keyboard, but a high-end keyboard should last longer than mine did.Edit: there is a flakiness in the keyboard. The enter key is working now, but it doesn't depress with a consistent feel. Oh well."
4,Only a few flaws,"I chose the G11 over the G15 because I didn't like the thought of having to give up my spinning volume wheel from the old Logitech Elite. Sadly, the volume wheel on the G11 is much worse than on the Elite. It has barely any tactile feedback, which would normally not be a problem, except that it is completely smooth save for a tiny bump you can barely feel. I had to adjust to pressing down harder on it to get it to even turn.I ran into a small snag with the media keys and controlling iTunes. By default, they would only control iTunes if it had focus (this may be iTune's fault). I had to get a plugin to fix this (get mmkeys.dll and use it as a plugin).The only other quibbles I have with the keyboard have been mentioned a bunch of times already: it takes getting used to coming from using a regular sized keyboard, and strange alignment of esc key with left edge of main keys.Other than this, I am very satisfied with this keyboard."
4,G11 Keyboard Review,"Well this is the first time I've ever purchased a gaming keyboard of any kind. I have to say, I am very impressed with its layout design and overall performance. The keys are very smooth under your fingertips. Typing is a breeze. The ""G"" button has pre-bundled software that assists you when creating/assigning keys. I love the feature of being able to press a G key and having an application start-up. The only real downfall that I have is the wrist resting area is just a simple piece of plastic. A simple $4-7 investment on a real cushion for your wrists is recommended.Overall, I give this keyboard a 4 of 5 stars"
2,Would not purchase again.,Nice keyboard except for the backlit keys. The keys are very hard to see most of the time and require a desk lamp to truly illuminate them. I would never purchase this unit again given the chance.
3,Logitech G11 Review,"Volume dial feels cheap and is difficult to operate because it is not a raised dial; it is flush to the keyboard. (so it is difficult to grip and turn.)Keyboard does not have a SLEEP button to put your PC in sleep mode, nor can you program a button to do so.Keys are difficult to read. Letters and words are very small and the fact that they are illuminated a deep blue color does not help as much as you would think. I find myself straining visually when I am serching for keys."
4,Great Keyboard,"I have had this keyboard for over a year now and first off have to say that I do love it. I am an avid gamer but I am also a writer so I type * a lot *. That being said, I am also female and have longish nails. Within about 3 months the keys had no letters left on them because of the letters being scratched off. I also agree with the other user about the volume control being very extreme and I do not use it either. Those are my only complaints about this keyboard, other than that I love it and would recommend it to anyone. Gamers will also love being able to use it with Vent and having the LCD showing who is talking."
3,Like it...mostly,"Pros: Good key action; audio controls includedCons: too dim; USB ports require self-powered items; tilt angle too shallowFor the most part, I like it, but I'm looking for a replacement. It's just too dim. Sorry Logitech, ""off"" does not qualify as a brightness level, and all we get is off, dim and less dim. The keys are just not bright enough unless the room is almost dark, and even then the light from the monitor make the keys hard to see. They really should have gone for a higher contrast color pairing than blue on black. The USB ports are a joke, really. I'm not sure what they mean in the description by ""full speed""...is that USB1 or USB2? Just spell it out. In any case, you'll need USB items with their own power sources, since the keyboard does not have enough power to run even a small USB drive. The keyboard barely tilts - barely enough for cables to squeeze under.With that said, I do like the key action and audio controls. It is a fairly comfortable keyboard for extended use."
2,Gaming G11... fair,"The basic functions work well. Programming game keys and the audio control was a feature that I could not get to function. In addition, the keyboard is much bigger than I anticipated... no room for the mouse.As I never could get the volumn controls or gaming keys to work... I returned the unit."
2,A bit disappointing,"I thought the book was a nice overview of the Golden Retriever. However, there were no specifics. I was looking forward to reading the section on housebreaking and it was ONE paragraph long. The book was pretty short and pretty basic. I will be getting another book for more information."
4,"The Guide to Owning a Golden Retriever : History, Selecting,",This book gives an in-depth understanding of the golden retriever- from practical information to care and love any owner should nurture. The title is comprehensive of what this book is all about.
3,For younger readers,"I just couldn't give more than 3 stars to this thriller. Basically a story about a new quantum energy source discovered by an American scientist but stolen by a Russian industrialist billionaire. The convenience of much of the story was too much. For example, The ring switch and the digging up of the parking lot. Everything fell too neatly in place. Since when do trained Navy Seal snipers allow sun reflections off their scopes to be seen? I think with a little more time, Tom Grace can come up with a better written novel. Older teenagers will enjoy his books.Recommend...Library"
3,Complex characters elevate this above standard action fare,"Shady Russian industrialists attempt to wrest control of an amazing new energy device from the American scientists who developed it. Tom Grace's story doesn't really add anything new to the techno-thriller genre, but it is nevertheless interesting due to some multi-faceted characterizations: even the featured good guys have some dark secrets and less than savory aspects to their personalities. Good pacing, nicely drawn secondary characters, and a story that doesn't overstay its welcome also help things along."
3,Here He Comes to Save the Day,"RE: AUDIO TAPE VERSION. Scientist/businessman/Navy SEAL and all around good guy Nolan Kilkenny takes on the former Soviet Union's top evil industrialist, its most treacherous commandos, and the 21st century cyber world to prevent an earth-shaking discovery from falling into the wrong hands. It's a mismatch of course. A routine thriller, Quantum does feature a nice twist revelation about the long-dead superphysicist whose work prompts much of the mayhem. You don't need to be scientifically-inclined to follow the story but it helps if you enjoy graphic ninja violence. 3 stars and no more - as in don't buy a ticket, but still rent the video."
3,Some characters not very believable,"Quantum was a decent story from beginning to end. I had a bit a trouble keeping its pace when the story got bogged down in explaining complex mathematical and scientific concepts. A few of the characters were hard to believe. Nolan got shot twice and injured a half dozen other ways, yet never lost a fight, and never even felt pain from his injuries. He also was shooting a dozen people throughout the book, and never once was questioned about being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Kelsey somehow lived through two kidnappings, when her kidnapper killed pretty much anything that moved during the story. I think I could try another Tom Grace story, but I probably won't rush out to buy it."
4,Great Fast Paced Action,I like a book that explores the scientific horizon while telling a good story. Just a good read!
5,Best Comedy of 2010!,Recently saw this film and loved it so much I bought several for gifts; a great way to spread cheer....COMEDY!
1,Profoundly offensive,"As a Jew I was shocked by the bigotry of this piece of trash. It's been a long time since I've seen such crude stereotyping of us. This is not a well-written finely observed comedy. The anti-semitism isn't strident, but couched in a series of lame jokes. At one point of emotional breakthrough, the muslim main character purposefully punches out a rabbi while he is praying. It's hard to imagine that Muslims would be happy with this either, as the main character is certainly made out to be woefully uneducated about other faiths. What a piece of dreck. (Look it up in an Yiddish dictionary!)"
4,NYUK! NYUK! NYUK!,"FUNNY as HELL!! This story is a good example of why people should just learn to make nice and not be so dang touchy about other people's bizness---As Frank Zappa used to say ""As long as it doesn't cause a murder---"""
1,A Huge Yawn For This One,"Don't breakout your credit cards for this book...Karen Chaney's book New England Remembers should be titled New England Should Forget This Book - besides the fact that the book is filled with historical inaccuracies (which raises the question is Karen Chaney a real crime historian?) it reads like a menu at a bad Chinese restaurant - ""same old, same old.""New England Remembers is not insightful and not very thought provoking which translates to - better spend your money elsewhere."
5,This book is brilliant.,"The title is a bit deceptive, as forgiveness is one of 7 ""humane virtues"" discussed in depth in this book. It's beautifully written with a lot of heart and depth. I plan to read ""Intimacy and Solitude"" next to get more of her writing."
3,Kindle formatting hampered readability,"This book, written from a Christian point of view, offers good advice for protecting your marriage from failure. However, the Kindle version contains many quotes that are inserted as graphics, which means you need to scroll back and forth to read each line. This made it very difficult to read the quotes that are included throughout the book."
3,No Love Today,"Having owned this album I am very excited to see its issue on CD, now if Amazon had only included a title list to see the other rarities. One other reviewer did mention the inclusion of No Love Today, which indeed, would make the price of the CD worth it on its own.No Love Today was actually released as a single, and I ought to know since I own a copy of it. Sadly, the song never charted, but certainly deserved to. One other mention of note is that the track was the title song to the Bill Cosby movie Mother Jugs and Speed. A real beauty of a song and a strong testament to Michelle's vocal prowess."
1,horrible product & waste of money,"just stick down the adhesive and slide the plastic part over it! your problems are solved! WRONG! i followed the directions 100% and within one day, water had gotten under the guard and loosened the adhesive. super strong adhesive only works if water doesn't get near it, and this product does not prevent water from getting next the adhesive tape. i had to caulk around the entire bottom of the guard to ensure it wouldn't come unstuck again and the product still doesn't work. save your money and don't buy this!"
2,shower guard,Looked for a shower guard for kids. Doesn't fit any of our showers. Has a square corner. All ours have curves where there is grout and corian.
4,"It's stinky and sticky, but does the job...","Very good at keeping mosquitos away, which is obviously the purpose, so on that account a very satisfactory result. The price to pay, though, is that it has a very strong insecticide smell that will permeate your clothing, bed, etc. Finally, there's the stickiness. Once on your skin, it's impossible not to feel it. I guess it can be compared to sunblock, not the ideal physical sensation, but necessary."
2,"works, but has an unpleasant smell","i bought this insect repellent to take with me to Palestine, where mosquito bites are a fact of life. this product has a distinct odor that is unbearable. this product works, however, i used this product twise and then i simply perfered the maddining mosquitoes to the smell of the repellent."
4,I GUESS it does the job,"Mosquitoes love me. I don't know what it is about me. I guess I have rich blood. However, I don't let this fact prevent me from doing the things I like to do outside, especially at dawn and dusk, such as fishing. I apply unscented Off! Insect Repellent whenever I know I'm going to be attacked by bugs. Supposedly, the Deet ingredient is the magic ingredient that repels bugs. I must say (and I've noticed other reviewers have pointed this out) that it seems like over the years the effectiveness of Off! has diminished somewhat, as if the manufacturer is watering it down, if you will. I remember when this product seemed more powerful and effective a couple of decades ago. It's either they're making it less powerful, or bugs are liking me more and more despite wearing Off!This product is unscented, which I prefer a lot more than the scented kind.I give this product 3 1/2 stars, rounded up to 4. If I was reviewing this product 20-30 years ago, I'd give it 5 stars."
1,Terrible,"This product destroys plastic. That means your watch, your sunglasses, your bike helmet. Everything. I will never use this product again. Just terrible."
3,always an easy read,"Always liked the Dummies books. They are not a complete subject matter book, but easy to keep reading and helpful. This book is no different, it will get you going in the right direction, but you will need more in depth books if your going to get serious. I do recommend to anyone, even though this is a bathroom reader in my house."
3,Thin book with glossy photos,"The writing is not very good - more like a stream of advertorials. There is overwhelming praise of Chanel's work - flattery more like it - without any criticism or analysis. However the pictures are good if you are collecting photos of Chanel's clothing designs over time. ""Chanel and Her World"" is a better book - it was put together with more thought. ""Chanel: The Couturiere At Work"" is just a thin book - more like a magazine, with insubstantial prose. Get it used."
1,It's in French,"... I understand English quite well (well enough to know to capitalize it) and I also know French. However, just because the title is written in French would in no way make it obvious the book is written in French as well. After all, the Ya-Ya's used French in their conversations throughout Ms. Wells' first 2 Ya-Ya books.It would seem to be a good idea if Amazon and other Web sites would tell the consumers this book is in French."
2,only Daniel Harding recording not to love,"I relish every Daniel Harding performance except this one. Some of it is the over-reverberant ambience that makes Beethoven sound more distant and grandiose than intimate. The orchestra sounds more romantic than classical. The tempos are too slow, and the phrasing is not sharp and to the point. Beethoven is never languid.Feh."
3,"Okay, for the price...","I was grateful that the packaging was strong because my deliver threw it over our 6' cast iron fence and it didn't break!!! However, as one other reviewer said the clear is actually foggy. I even let it set over a week to see if it would settle; it didn't :( . It is still cool but sometimes, even after it has been on for hours, the wax stays in the bottom and wont move and then when it does it stays in a long line and gathers too much at the top. It arrived 5 days before the estimated and I had free SSS so that was a plus :)"
1,Lousy lava lamp,"We received a larger lava lamp quite a few years ago as a gift that continues to work beautifully, so we didn't expect any problems with another one. This was purchased as a gift for our teen son. It worked well the first day only. The waxy substance clearly warms up and just sits at the bottom of the lamp. It may swell a little, threatening to release a blob, then settles down and does nothing. If my charming son had not thrown out the packing material the day he opened the gift, sure he would love it and have no reason to return it, this would be going straight back."
2,cheap design and material,This is not the same Lava lamp we grew up with. This is a capped bottle of liquid with a cheap base. Bulb was replaced on day two and the wax never flows correctly.
1,Horrible Product,"The light-bulb is very low voltage, the ""lava"" is very poor quality, and the water is cloudy. Don't make the same mistake I did, I thought that there was no way Amazon would actually allow the selling of such a defective product, but I was wrong. These lava lamps are horrid in every way, as evident from their horribler and cheap manufacture from China. These are not worth $14. These are trash."
3,Great Price- get what you pay for!,"My 16 yr old daughter wanted a lava lamp for her newly re-decor'd room.We both liked the black liquid and the silver lamp, and I was shocked to find one for $12.00! So, I ordered myself one as well. We got them so fast, which was awesome, mine was bent which was an easy fix, I just re-formed it. But the one thing I can't change is the murky,completely unclear water that the lamp has.But........ for 12 bucks, hell, what do I expect? Overall happy with it, but if your looking for clarity, this isnt the lamp for you."
1,FOGGY LAVA LAMP,"ORDERED LAVA LITE BLACK LAVA/CLEAR LIQUID ALONG WITH TWO OTHER COLORS.THE BLACK LAVA LAMP WAS SO MILKY WHITE INSIDE YOU COULDNT SEE THE LAVA.RE-ORDERED ANOTHER ONE ,IT CAME IN JUST AS BAD.I WOULD NOT ORDER ANY MORE FROM TIS COMPANY."
2,Came Back Cloudy,"I was very excited to order my lava lite. It came in within a reasonable timeframe and it was all in one piece, however, when i opened it, instead of the liquid being clear it was very cloudy where I could not see the ""lava"" I tried every means I could find when it came to fixing it, to no avail. I'm disappointed and want to order another one but am concerned the same thing will happen."
1,Lava Lamp,"I have always been very pleased with the products that I receive from Amazon. Unfortunately, I am very unhappy with the Lava Lamp, Lava Lite Black/Clear lamp. It had residual black smudges all through the lamp. It was very disappointing and it is all on the inside so there is no way to try to clean it up. Heating it up was no help, so it was basically a waste of money."
1,WOW,"Lava Lite 2116-4002 Classic Lava Lamp, 14-1/2-Inch, Black/ClearThis product that i received in the mail was not black and clear it was black with murky water so dense you could not even see the wax"
1,"Cloudy, of course!","I wanted a black lava lamp with clear liquid. All I have is a yellowish, putrid murky lava laml with black lava.. or at least I think it is? you can hardly see the lava, the solution is so murky! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!I think it would be worth the hassle of making your own lamp. So Im going to do just that."
1,to small after 2 days it finally tried to work,Buying this is not your 70's lava lamp. it's to small and the colors are not strong enough. If your looking for a real lava lamp this isn't it
1,IT DOESN'T WORK !!!!!,First it came not in a good condition (some scratches on the glass and other things). second you can not see anything inside and I tried to concentrate with no hope. It was a big waste of money specially for those who order it overseas. I m really disappointed
2,cloudy,it came cloudy and never cleared up. So not very good can't see the purple wax and i bought it for my wife :(
1,Didn't work at all...wasted money,The item did not work. By the time I payed for shipping again. It would be cheaper just to buy it from a store where it can be easily returned.
1,Not like the original,"We bought a total of three of these units, in different colors. All become cloudy then after several hours, most of the inside stays at the top. The picture shows a clear liquid, however this is not the case. We contacted the mfg, but never received a reply. What you see is not what you get."
3,Works well but the water is foggy.,"I had read reviews about the water being cloudy in other lava lamps, but bought this in hopes that I would be one of the lucky people who got a nice clear lamp. I was wrong, although, not completely disappointed. The water is murky in my lava lamp, but not so much that I can't see the lava move. I have read views and watched YouTube videos where you can change out the water solution to make the water clear in the lamp, but I don't have the time or patience to attempt a water change, nor do I think I should have to pay for a DIY project. The lamp works in every other way you would expect a lamp to work. It takes about 30 minutes or so for the lava to get heated and start moving around, and once it is warm it moves around for hours of viewing pleasure. The light is dim enough that I can leave it on as a night light and not be disturbed while I sleep. If it weren't for being murky I would be 100% satisfied with this product."
1,Cloudy Water,"The description says the water is clear, but the water is quite cloudy. It is disappointing. The kid that I purchased it for tore apart the package immediately making it impossible to return. He doesn't even want it now."
1,Does NOT work,"I had bought another lava lamp from Amazon, and this one seemed like a wonderful addition......sadly there are just two blobs of wax on at the top and one at the bottom sitting there. This was a waste of money alright."
4,Lava Lamp Does What It Should Do,Lamp works great and looks like everything a lava lamp should look like. There is only one bad thing about this and that is that the liquid is not clear at all. It's not clear/red it's red/red. I probably would have bought a different one if I had known but it's still a cool lamp.
3,Not everything I wanted.,"I purchased this lamp as a present for a friend. The lamp arrived in a timely manner, but after that, things went downhill. It took several tries over a period of multiple days to get the lava to function as it should (ie, not lay stuck in one large clump at the bottom of the lamp). Also, the solution the lava is in is very cloudy which means it's not very nice to look at. However, the customer service department at LAMPS PLUS is very friendly and really helpful."
1,Poor Quality,"First one arrived and the water was very cloudy whether cold, or plugged in for a few hours...milky not pure clear like it should be. Sent it back, 2nd one wasn't much better. Metal ring at bottom floats around and hardens in sight after it's unplugged.Poor Quality."
1,Does not work,"We purchased this for our son's birthday (on request!). Arrived in fine condition but does not ""bubble."" We are returning it for a replacement. If that works will update the review."
1,Lava Lite Very Cloudy,"Not happy with this item. The water in the Lava Lite is very cloudy making it hard to see the lava. The Lava hardy moves, I think the lamp is old. Lamp also leaked on shipping. Not worth the money."
3,Lava Lamp Blue/Clear/Silver,"Just the lava lamp in for my kids for Christmas and the ""Clear Liquid"" is actually a white color. That makes seeing the action of the blue wax a bit hard. Other than that we are very pleased with the product."
2,Not as happy with performance of Lava Lite as I expected.,The Lava Lite takes a long time to heat up enough to move at all and then just a couple of large ball like lava wax globs rise slowly and singly to the top. I am use to a more active Lava Lamp so this one is a disappointment. I guess I will have to shop locally to purchase a good Lava lamp and not depend on internet orders to satisfy my electronics/home decor needs.A very disappointed child of the '60's. Christine Simpson
2,Wrong color...,"I got the wrong one, was suppose to get a blue base, but got the silver base. There was a REASON I order the blue base, but I guess Amazon knew better for me. I hate it when that happens!"
4,"Looks great, fun to watch","I've had mine for about 9 months. It looks great, very dynamic and active. The orange color casts a nice warm light in the room.The downside is it takes almost 2 hours for this thing to get started. The instructions warn about this. It think it may vary a lot with the temperature of the room, and I keep my house pretty cold."
3,BETTER PRICING ELSEWHERE,THE FIRST ONE I RECIEVED WAS CLOUDY AND I HAD TO RETURN IT. THE SECOND ONE WAS BETTER BUT STILL IS NOT CYSTAL CLEAR. BETTER TO PURCHASE THIS AT WALMART WHERE IT IS A BETTER PRICE.
5,Gift,I bought this for my year old daughter and she loves it.I would buy this product again and would recommend
2,Had to return,Cheaply made and stopped working within a week. The gel started to get really gross and lost it's deep red color plus it stopped flowing through the lamp. Didn't bother with a replacement.
3,Small Lava lamp,This was certainly a very inexpensive lava lamp so I can't complain too much. It is a very small lamp and the bulb is not very bright. Otherwise it is a lava lamp. It is hard to tell if the lamp is even on.
1,Foggy Lava Lamp,Lamp came totally foggy. Seems like Lava Lite quality has hit the bottom. Not worth the time and hassle to returm. I bought 4 lamps and 3 were foggy.
4,"Cool, blue light","This lava lamp arrived 6 weeks before I expected it, allowing it to be a Christmas gift for our 15-year-old. She had been wanting one for a long time. The low cost was a plus. Overall, this is a good value and appears just as described. Well packaged and easy to assemble."
3,Its alright,"It is ok, the only flaws are that it is kind of hard to see the white liquid and that it takes a while to heat up compared to other lava lamps. I think that it is an alright lava lamp though and I don't regret buying it, You could probably find a better one though."
3,Read for cloudiness issues.,"I see a lot of people complaining that their water is cloudy, and a lot of people complaining about those people who are complaining that the water is cloudy.After a bit of research, I have learned that the cloudiness is actually due to a manufacturing error, which caused huge batches of Lava Lamps to have cloudy water.They then unloaded all these screw-ups on to amazon to sell for cheap. Supposedly they have fixed it, so newer batches should not have this problem. The fact of the matter is this: it is a lava lamp. Mine is cloudy, but it works as a lava lamp should. They are cheap because they are screwed up. Save your money for a better one if you want to guarantee that it's not cloudy, or buy a cheap one and have it likely be cloudy. I wish I had read the reviews, because this lamp would be SO cool if it was nice and clear. But oh well."
2,Red/Clear means Red/Cloudy,"The picture shows the Red/Clear as being clear as water. It's clear as dirty water. I thought it would settle, but it hasn't. Still works fine as a lava lamp, so I gave it an extra star for that."
3,Attack of the Blob,"My lava lamp, when it gets warmed up, tends to have all the wax stay in one lump at the top of the lamp, rather than circulating in smaller lumps to create the typical lava lamp look. A little disappointing."
2,Not really that good,"I purchased this lamp as a present for a friend. The lamp arrived in a timely manner, but after that, things went downhill. It took several tries over a period of multiple days to get the lava to function as it should (ie, not lay stuck in one large clump at the bottom of the lamp). Also, the solution the lava is in is very cloudy which means it's not very nice to look at. However, the customer service department at LAMPS PLUS is very friendly and really helpful."
3,too long..,It takes about an hour to heat up and start working even at room tempature thats why i rate it a 3
3,"Retro, lava lamp","These lamps have to warm up for 2+ hours before they start to do their thing.They get VERY warm, even through there is only 1 small bulb.I wouldn't recommend this for small children , or for leaving on extended periods of time."
3,Not very clear,"What ever the fluid in the lamp, it is not clear at all. This is the slowest of my 3 lamps to start. Not my best purchase."
4,"Fun ""Black"" Lava is awesome!","I bought this lava lamp for my 11 year old son for Christmas. Boy, does he love it! The ""Black"" lava (really more of a deep purplish, but still cool) is really awesome, and unique. The liquid is clear and really shows off the lava. Takes a while to really heat up- a couple hours- but it's fun to watch."
1,Disappointed,"The lamp got here fairly quick but the ""lava"" doesn't melt or bubble and the liquid is foggy. I had to throw it out and order another one."
2,Cloudy Fluid,"We ordered two of these. One in red and this one in black. They seem sturdy enough, but the liquid on the black one is so cloudy that you can hardly make out the lava inside. The red one is also cloudy, but not nearly as much. I'd say you have a 50/50 chance of getting one thats just plain useless."
2,Very Cloudy; Read the ratings,Very cheap quality.VERY VERY cloudy.Liquid is not 'clear' as advertised. It is almost YELLOW and it is very cloudy and murky.NOT worth 20 dollars.
1,Foggy due to improper handling,"It's a good-looking Lava Lite lamp, they are products that should be handled with caution, but as many others, it's foggy and I'm pretty sure it's like that because of the improper handling of the package. We all know that this ""foggy"" thing happens when the lamp have been abused, shaken, etc. Now, returning it's not an option because it's a pain and it's trouble instead of a solution. I paid for the product and for shipping and handling, this time, they didn't do well with HANDLING, but did do well on CHARGING. What we need is that everything we buy should be handled with caution and respect, they are items that we paid for. Nobody like buying things that are either broken, defective or not working as they should."
2,wrong lamp,While I must applaud the rapid delivery of my order - the Lava Lamp in the package was not the one that was listed. I ordered a Black / Clear lamp I received a purple / cloudy.The lamp I received works fine -it's just the wrong one.
2,Bulb Burnt Out When First Turned On,"The title of this review says it all. The moment I turned it on, the filament in the bulb blew. On a positive note, mine doesn't seem to be cloudy like many other people are experiencing, but I'd just like to actually USE the lamp. I can tell already customer service through their 800 number is going to be a dead end...It's been a day since I left a message and no call back yet. Also their ""infomaster@lavalite.com"" e-mail address get's returned. It's really too bad that such a classic product seems to be in the hands of incompetence. One look at the ""official"" Lava Lite site and it's pretty obvious whoever is in charge doesn't seem to care...it's a mess, and looks likes it was put together by the current owners 12 YO son."
5,Oh the memories!!,"After hearing a lot of negative feedback on these types of Lava Lamps, I must say that I am quite happy with it! It works great! I've used it several times, wouldn't change a thing. It brings back memories of my teenage years. This lamp was so inexpensive, far less than on other sites. It's fun to watch! I'm going to buy one for my niece and granddaughter too. Thank you very much!"
1,crappy lava lamp,"i received lava lamp within a few days, but it was all foggy, tried to see if it would settle and it didn't. Big disappointment."
3,A little thin...,"A little on the ""sheer"" side, and even though I bought the largest they had, the little toes don't fit completely over my size 12/13 toes!Still, reduces blisters!"
5,Great Socks - Great Price.,The price of these socks was much better than the Japanese ones. They fit as nicely as the Japanese ones.
2,The humming noise is terrible!,"The charger works, yes, but so does every other kind you could get. In reality, there aren't too many bad things one could say about a charger. However, this one you can. It humms so loud that I can't have it in the bedroom at night and since that's where I charge my phone, the charger is useless to me. Maybe I'm paranoid, but electronic devices that hum when they aren't supposed to, make me think of fires... Again, not something to look forward to."
3,"Flax seed oil, wonder labs","I......think i lost these. Had i NOT lost them, I would probably recommend, as flax seed is a beneficial supplement."
1,A Wolf in Sheeps Clothing,Yee uses the usual victim arguements.What about the LT he slept with while still married.What about his endorser for Muslim chaplains who was also giving money to radical muslims.Yee shame on you. You got caught and now are making money.
4,Darkness meets Angel meets Gentle Giant,"Upon listening to this, I now know who the lead singer of the Darkness was primarily influenced by (except he does not have the range or differention of this singer).Instrumentally, if you like the progressive pomp of Angel and the intristicness of Gentle Giant, you will like this Cd.Only giving it 4 stars because 2 of the middle songs are a bit lacklusterBy the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves, thus the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"
3,Alexander the Pretty Darn Good!,"For what it is -- an hour-long 1960s TV pilot -- this ain't bad at all! Productions values are okay, and the outdoor locations, though recognizably the American West, are nonetheless spectacular. John Cassavetes and Joseph Cotton turn in fine performances, and Shatner (who never looked better shirtless) shows why he became a worldwide star; he's a more charismatic Alexander than either Richard Burton or Colin Farrell. (Adam West's role is too small to register.) The story is fictional, not historical, but typical of the kinds of yarns that have been woven about Alexander in many lands for many centuries, a mini-melodrama of treachery and wartime intrigue. If only they had gone ahead and made a TV series...but then Shatner would not have made Star Trek, and West would not have played Batman! The bonus featurette, ""Hollywood's Epic Films,"" is essentially a 40-mintue compilation of vintage trailers. All in all, this dvd is well worth the modest price."
2,Shatner is Alexander and......Help!,"William Shatner, as every young actor does...has to start somewhere. ANd although his youth is no excuse - his performace has the Greek icon 'Alexander' is strong.It's just everything else is week. His fellow cast is light on the seriousness of the part and the production value is a little scary.Although if your a fan od Shatner, you might want this for the pure excercise of seeing the begingings of Shanter's often satarized 'acting style'. You will see his dramatic appraoch to anger and greed.Overall the film is slow and weak, but I believe the only reason it was made available was because William Shatner is in it! 3-26-09."
3,Robert Nathan's first book was a failure,"This book should be read by all of Robert Nathan fans because it was his first book. The original printing was for 1000 copies in 1919-1920 and all of them did not sell. It was considered a failure and there weren't any more printings until recently. After this failure, all of Robert Nathans books took a marked turn toward fantasy. This book is a semi-autobiographical fiction book. This is the only book of Robert Nathan that I don't own though I have read it twice."
3,Starting off on the wrong foot,"This was Robert Nathan's first novel and not like his later short fantasies. It's a coming-of-age story (also semiautobiographic) about Kindred, who goes to Exeter, then Harvard, falls for some crazy socialistic ideology, meets Joan, and marries her. They decide not to have children by not having sex. That lasts awhile - then she gets pregnant, but the baby dies. Nathan makes the mistake of choosing a topic (himself) that he finds interesting (naturally) but then fails to make interesting to anybody else. Fortunately he decided to go in another direction with his fiction, to much better relults."
3,Not good for college chemistry course,This book is not in depth enough. Many times I just turned to the web to find the information I needed.
1,This book sucks,"This book is absolutely terrible. It either explains a difficult concept very quickly or explains an easy one in great detail, only to later give problems that do not correlate with the explanation in the book. Once I'm done with chemistry this semester I am going to burn it."
4,Great for serious learners,"Just as the seller described it. Just a few marks of age in the book, and some highlighter ink on it, but it doesn't interrupt reading. It's an easy to follow book overall, perhaps it could be better if they avoid making the student come back to a previous example, instead repeating the pertaining data in the new example, so the student doesn't have to go back in the book to look for it.Aside from that, good General Chemistry book."
2,Not Happy,"My unhappiness isn't with the games fault by all means. I bought this game way back when it first released, and loved it couldn't get enough of it. Then over the years lost it and of course upgraded PC's and such. Saw the picture again while i was browsing one day and was like ohhhhh yes i gotta play that game again, and so i found it and bought it but to my dismay the game won't work on my PC:( I wish it would though cause its a super fun addicting game. So some advice for others before you buy the older games, do some research and make sure you can play these older games or are able to before you buy:) happy Gaming"
1,"Looks fun, if you knew how to play it","The game looks really great, the only downfall to it is I have not discovered a MANUAL. I couldn't find one in paper form, nor in pdf form on the cd. I contacted Jowood who wrote the game, and didn't get much help at all."
2,"Good materials, but design lacking.","This rest is made of quality parts. I did not like the design for two main reasons.The rest attaches below the seat, which means that the back rest will not rotate along with the seat when turning. This I found to be a problem when playing, as the back rest would restrict elbow room.The hardware is bulky, adding about 8 inches to the back of the throne. This made me need to move my whole kit and pushed it out a decent amount. This also means there is a decent gap between the back edge of the seat and the back rest that results in less firm of support. There is a way to push it out further, but not bring it in much."
4,Love on first listen,I have loved this song since first hearing it a few months ago when I bought the album. Excellent upbeat production with sexy lyrics. The Cottonbelly and Rudimacan mixes also make this single a must own for any Esthero/music lover.
3,"Good points, bad points","My kids liked the pictures, presentation. They have the three other books in this series and enjoy them. We were all puzzled to find, though, many common birds that my children specifically looked for were left out."
2,Waste of time,"While this movie tries to make you care about the characters, it just devolved into the usual ""we're gonna try to scare you by not showing you anything and just making people disappear during scary music"". The ending just sucks eggs through a straw."
2,Ending is a Dud,Plot had great potential but the suspense ran out half way through and was almost perdictable. Ending was very dispointing and story line left viewers in the dark. Would not recommend.
2,more funny than scary,"As expected, this was a pretty bad movie...but that's why I watched it. The acting was definitely sub-par, especially by the lead males, and they did plenty of dumb things at every turn. One of the biggest problems, though, was the special effects/costumes. The humanoids looked more funny than scary. (Seriously, pause the video on their bodies, and you can't help to giggle). They tried to make it scary with quick camera work, but there were just to many holes...and those creatures are so dang funny."
3,Alright,"Not really much to it, they go on a trip and bad things happen (well everyone dies). But Jesse McCartney is in it, that was pretty cool."
3,Another in the long tradition of atomic disaster movies,"Using a small cast and a largely empty setting, this movie provides the promised scare in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock. That is to say, the tension created not so much with what is shown, but rather with what you do not see but is implied. It is fairly late in the movie before you actually see any ""monsters"". By that time, it really does not matter how convincing the special effects are. You are ready to believe."
3,A decent horror flick ...,"I am not a huge connoisseur of horror flicks, but this was one that I had looked forward to seeing as I have read articles about tourism in the Chernobyl disaster area and how the environment has adapted to the high radiation levels. The movie started out very promising and had a lot of potential but seemed to just peter out in the end. It would have been nice if the movie had a more concise conclusion, but for a horror flick it was entertaining and fine."
3,Predictable but Entertaining,"Chernobyl Diaries is a bit predictable...an unorthodox tour that has some unexplained events turns into a government's secret nightmare. Although nothing special or extraordinary, the film does keep you engaged and on your toes because you never know what may jump out at you next. There is a bit of gore, so if you don't want to see bone out of skin then definitely skip but if you have the spare time and love anything that goes bump in the night or bump in the abandoned town of Chernobyl then not a bad way to spend your time."
2,Terrible Storyline,I am typically a scaredy cat... I don't like movies that even look to be scarey but a friend talked me into getting this movie. There was nothing at all scarey about this movie or even creepy. The plot was horrible and the movie never really went anywhere. I'd save yoursef the money and not purchase this movie.... move on to the next.
1,horrible,it was horrible Bc everyone dies. someone should have lived. I hate movies where no one survives. other than that it was ok but I really don't like no survivors
1,If I could only rate it less...,"Lame, boring, stupid...when did this movie first come out? Late whenever they started using special effects and/or plots? What a waste of my $3.99 to rent this garbage. Hills Have Eyes is a 5 compared to this."
1,chernobyl diaries,sorry this was the worst movie i have seen in a long time esp with the name paranormal activity any where around it this movie wasnt scary the best parts of the movie was in the preview watch it and save ureself 5 dollars they had such a great idea and then turned it into the bigest suckfest of this year but i am glad i only rented it and didnt buy it so if u just have to see it wait for it to be on prime where it wont cost u extra or it to b on cable
2,Great premise!,"But not a great film. If you've seen the trailers, you know the set up, and it's a GREAT idea.However, something just didn't work for me when I saw it in the theater. I think the first 20 minutes are pretty good--and there's a nice cast and they can all act and it was well shot/directed. Maybe it was that there simply wasn't much story to tell, and the last 30 mins it seems everyone was running and screaming, running and screaming.I had a sense that the writers/directors/producers really DIDN'T know where they were headed with the story and the rushed and disappointing ending confirms it. I see this release as an alternate ending, which, to me, means that the crew didn't have a real complete vision in mind.And it's NOT found footage, but it IS hand held camera."
2,low budget,"Had a lot of room for improvement, could have been taken anywhere with this basic plot, but went pretty much no where. When are directors going to stop using hand held cameras? It's shaky, and signifies that the movie is guaranteed to be bad. Stop making these out of focus trailer park trauma's!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!,"It would have been a better movie without the B movie cast. God awful!!!! The Idea of the movie is ok, but it needed more!"
1,What a colossal waste of time and money!,"This movie can possibly be counted as both the worst waste of my time and money ever. I am so sick and tired of the screaming, jittery camera with no lights scenario in movies such as well as Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch Project."
2,Mediocrity imitates art,"Do you remember how other networks tried to imitate the feel of ""Lost"" and how you felt duped out of hours of your life that you would never get back after indulging them by watching? So some kids with a camcorder really liked ""Cloverfield"" and felt that anyone could do it. Sadly, not."
3,Not as expected,Movie was majorly overrated. Most of the movie was outlined in the previews. Story line was well built but not deprecated very good. Overall movie was a waste of money. Ending sucked. Felt as if it was done before. Just like all the other movies like it
3,Fun but comes up short. Worth a rental IMHO.,Convincing atmosphere for the most part. There's only so many places a movie like this can go and we've all seen them. Still had a few surprises and goose bumps.
3,"Good suspense, although overall predictable","This movie was okay. It has some good suspense scenes, but the dialogue is very weak and overall the story is predictable. It was nonetheless entertaining to watch."
3,It's ok. Along the production quality of Paranormal Activity series,"Good for a few chills and jumps and some good gore. Very predictable actions, but the acting I thought was above average for these actors who jumped whole heartedley into their roles."
2,Awful ending.,Of course we didn't think it would be a real positive ending but we were still pretty dissapointed with the end.
2,uuug,"too short, bad plot line poor execution. i was not scared or even tense at any point in the film."
2,boring,"nothing unusual here. no surprises. no real shock or scare value. i felt it to be poorly made. i don't think i'd ever watch it again. okay to be honest, my sisters wanted to watch it and i fell asleep halfway through but from what they told me, it wasn't worth the purchase."
1,horrible movie,THis movie was aweful. I don't expect oscar caliber performances from zombie movies just zombies in more than the last 20 minutes of the movie.
4,Mutant Mayhem,"In the theme of documentary style horror, this movie has you going ""oh no, don't go in there"" a lot."
3,An entertaining horror flick,"While not ground breaking in its premise, its standard horror flick that will most likely leave you at the least entertained. There are some creepy moments dealing with children which always freaks me out bit but overall a fun horror movie which I recommend to any genre fan."
2,Stupid,"Nice way to waste 2 hours, fun to watch but has no purpose or even slight meaning.Just a time waster using a different medium than usual."
3,Its a little lame,The story line was a good one but the movie was low on spooky and high on not so god acting. It could have been alot longer too.
3,Slightly Disappointed,"Could and should of been better. Great idea that just didn't deliver. Not enough development, not scary enough, and the acting was average."
3,OKAY,"It was not a great movie, but not a bad one. It was pretty predictable. I would say if you have nothing else to watch give it a try. Not scary at all."
3,Horror lovers will like this,"Horror lovers will like this movie but for mainstream viewers it may be a bit ""B"" rated. But I really enjoyed it."
3,"Diaries, what?","This movie ended up to be one of the least expected movies to end just like the American movies, predictable."
2,Just another bad movie,For a home rental the price is fine but the movie itself is just bad. Acting and character development just dont exist in this movie. Save those precious minutes from your life and do something more benefiting.
1,At the end,"they all die. It wasn't a good movie, it was gimmicky and created more shock than actual fear. OH MY GOD A BEAR! HOLY CRAP A PERSON! boo to you Jonathan Sadowski."
2,Could have been better,"There were many predictable moments in this movie, it was like I knew what was going to happen right before it did. There were no suprises here which is sad because the premise has potential."
2,not bad...but very predictable,"Not a bad movie. The fact that a creepy place like Pripjat could indeed work very well as the location of a horrorfilm seems to have evaded all sorts of moviemakers for the last 25 years. So it was about time that someone took notice. The problem here is, they could have done so much - imagine this abandoned city, perhaps mutation of animals and nature through radiation from the reactors, or maybe a cover-up story by the government etc. but no! I'm not gonna spoil who or what the villains are, but I have to say this: if this is really all that the filmmakers could come up with, man, my dead grandpa would have had more imagination !If there wasn't this terrible lack of originality, it could have been a truly great movie. But there are lots of films that are much worse, so if you are able to look beyond the (very) average storyline you might still enjoy it. At least the setting is perfect."
1,Awful,"Boring, generic, nothing special, nothing new; another misleading commercial. Take my word for it and don't even waste your time or money, skip it completely."
3,Amazing Atmosphere -- Not Much Else...,"CHERNOBYL DIARIES is not the worst movie you'll ever see - the atmosphere is chilling and creepy, the acting is adequate and there are a few genuinely scary moments. However, beyond that, it's totally by-the-book and there are no surprises whatsoever. I checked it out because I love the Paranormal Activity films (though this one is not found footage). I don't consider my time wasted, but I probably won't re-watch it any time soon."
3,"Needs alternative ending, to make it great!","Good production. Nice directing. And, actors were pretty impressive.. Does such a good job of keeping you intrigued... They COULD have done SO MUCH MORE with this story-line. This is when I wish I were in the business of editing films!! Had the ending been different, this movie could have been on a whole new level...!!! I could have given it an end that would have risen it's rating by,a minimum of, 2 or 3 points!"
4,Old time suspense+ fast pace= fun movie watching!,"This was refreshingly fun for the often old, predictable and tired zombie/monster genre. My husband and I did not expect much...keeping our remote control close! But, it was a good old fashioned, well timed monster flick. We liked the fast moving pace, and the fact that they did not try to make this a CG overloaded monster flick. The movie relied on a lot of suspense and anticipation for the next step. We thought it was a fun watch!"
2,A bust.,It's a film that you have seen before just with a different story line. I should have known better and would not recommend.
3,Not much to say ...,... your typical 'Foreigner in for something they never imagined' type movie. Not a lot of gore - in case you have squeamish people with you.
2,Snoozefest,"All of the potentially scary moments were shown in the trailer. This flick had more running around than I thought it would have. It needed more creepy ""what's that in the shadow"" scenes to be scary."
1,Boring,"Since it begin I just tough it was so boring, no good actors not a good story only rented I'm glad"
2,could have been much more,The movie could have been awesome if they mixed hill's have eyes with dawn of the dead. Mutant living cannibals with intelligence and social skills. So they invite you to dinner not to eat but be eaten. This is my intellectual property.
1,Cherynobyl is still spewing crap 26+ years later,They could have done so much more with this movie plot but really blew it.Don't waste your time or MONEY with this....
2,"Not worth your time!! Don't bother, stinks!","It seems like any or all of the so called ""good parts"" were in the TV commercials/trailers. The movie seemed to drag on & if your looking for a ""scary movie"" to watch...this is NOT the one..felt like we wasted a night watching it & have warned all of our friends not to rent it. I'm actually being kind by giving it 2 stars, but don't waste your money..its predictable & just plain boring & not scary at all..more ridiculous than anything.."
2,Warning: Contains too many TSL characters,"Wow, too many characters making incredible stupid mistakes (TSL=too stupid to live)... I can't tell if the creator of this movie is so dumb or they think the audience is. Do not PAY for this!"
4,Enjoyed it!,It may not be the best frightening movie out there but I loved it anyway! A little bit nailbiting entertainment.
2,BIG LETDOWN,"This movie was a big disappointment. The suspense built up to a big letdown. None of the ""things/people"" were every really revealed and the storyline fell apart as no explanation on where the ""things/people"" came from or how long they had been there. I wasted my money on this one."
2,chernobyl diaries,"the quality of the movie was bad. it started and stopped constantly throughout the showing. as for the movie itself, i would rather have been there at chernobyl during the disaster than sit through it."
2,Bore!,"This movie was disappointing. With a long wait for dvd release, this was a let down. If you must see it, get ready for a comedy!"
3,Fun no thinker...,Interesting premis. I liked the perspective of the camera as sort of a silent videographer shooting a documentary. A little slow to get the fun started. The ending - really?
1,Don't bother.,"The only interesting thing about this is the location shoot. Not scary, characters are downright stupid and unsympathetic. Don't waste your money."
2,Really?,One of the dumbest endings for an overall good movie. Everything looked believable until the ending. Yes it's a plausible ending but they could have done a lot better.
2,Disappointed...,"This film had the chance to be scary, but fell short of the mark.My daughters and I are horror film buffs, we were excited from what we saw in the trailers.To say the least the trailer was better put together than the film.Great concept, short on execution."
2,Didn't Deliver,Seemed promising at first but lost momentum fast. A quarter of the way it started to remind me of The Blair Witch Hunt but sadly it didn't deliver. All the characters start dying off and the story ends up nowhere with a very poor ending. Don't waste your time or the $3.99.
3,Not what I thought it was,"Not what I expected. I thought it was suppose to be a ""haunted/paranormal"" movie. All it turned out being was a ""The hills have eyes"" but at Chernobyl."
1,If only I could get my money back,"I did not read the description that well. I thought it was a documentary on Chernobyl, was bummed out when the opening scene had two dudes talking about girls/dating/yuck. Who would take a hot chick to a mess like that.Attractive women like walking on the beach Duh."
2,Didn't really like it.,"There really wasn't much of a plot line. It was too predictable, it could have been so much better if they would have had more of a story line."
3,Better movie than I expected,"This movie was better than I expected but the digital quality was poor :( In the scenes where it's dark, which is most of the movie, the film was grainy and pixellated"
2,Predictable,The movie was alright i just found it all to be just a little to predictable to the point of it being boring.
2,lame,"this story had a chance to be a great movie. The screenplay was believable and the actors were decent,just seems like the director and writers had no idea how to put in action.Highly disappointed."
1,Horrible movie,"Was pumped to go see this in theaters. Now I just want to add another one star review to help people stay away from this garbage excuse for a horror flick, you have been warned..."
3,Real or not!,"I visited Pripyat soon after. The movie wasn't even shot there. That's how flawed the movie is. Come on! At least shoot the scene at the ferris wheel on site. If you want to see my adventure, type in ""Decay is headed your way! (Pripyat)Thanks"
2,Everyone so far has given bad review:,So they want $24.95 for this before it's even released? Sounds like a bummer to me because I saw it in the theatre and was a bit surprised but it didn't really have enough of a story line or action and I had heard that it was based on a true story which apparently is not the truth. It's sort of a zombie type picture at the end.I don't think that price justifies it though since I only paid 4 dollars to see it in the theatre.
3,If I had to do it over again would I rent this movie?,"That is a very good question. The movie is neither good nor bad. Nothing groundbreaking but nothing really awful. The acting was pretty good and the movie was shot pretty well. Storyline was predictable and the virtually invisible ""boogie men"" was certainly not very original.Yeah, if I had to do it over again I would probably rent this movie."
2,Horrible ending!!,"Movie was ok throughout. Ok graphics, ok acting. Fairly realistic for scifi horror. Horrible ending. Wouldnt recommend to pay money to watch. Ok for free prime membership"
2,decent,"movie had a plot which is good for a horror movie, but very tedious at getting the point across. 2 stars for effort."
3,Not bad,"They did a really good job recreating the Chernobyl area, it looks just like the pictures show. As to the movie itself the acting is just ok at best and the movie is pretty predictable. Not bad but not that great either."
1,dumb,This was one of the biggest wastes of time.... The lead character was pretty cool but the infected were dumb and the story line was suuuper predictable. Thanks but no thanks.
3,Ending left me wanting,"Starts off promising. It's interesting to see Pripyat and see the effects of Chernobly. I'm surprised they got permission to film in the area. It's still dangerous grounds. Anyway, the first half of the movie is all that. Then you realize group of tourist who paid for the tour are not alone in the town. Dun, dun, dun.... Actually, it's not that spooky."
2,disappointed,"All I can say is I'm glad I had free video credits and didn't spend money on renting this, I really only got it to watch with my brother who was over at the time. I hoped it would be good but it was disappointing and predictable. My wife even laughed at some and it wasn't made to be ""funny"" so far as i could tell."
2,bad story line,i expected something better the movie started off good and scary until the point where you know whats the main point and its no longer scary
4,Chernobyl or how I spent my Russian vacation...,"Good low budget film and textbook case on how to use natural lighting to convey the story, Really recommend this anyone that likes good scary movies. Kind of reminded me of a Russian ""hills have eyes""."
3,Must see for all S.T.A.L.K.E.R.S,"If you spent as long as me playing Call of Pripyat as me you'll like the scenery. After looking at Pripyat on Google maps and youtube I could see places Id 'been' and knew the buildings. The plot is fairly old and tiard and the 'monsters' look like people with stockings on their heads. But not a bad effort, considering some of the other crap out there."
2,Nuke this movie,Eh! It was ok. Good thing I popped some popcorn and buttered it up. If my fingers weren't do slippery I would've taken the remote and turned this off.
3,Different,this movie was a little different than what I expected and the end was even more than I expected. It was an ok movie
4,Chernobyl Diaries,Great movie for any of those horror junkies. Good storyline with some suspense in all the right places. Not too gory.
2,CHERNOBYL DIARIES A DISAPPOINTING DUD,"When PARANORMAL ACTIVITY stunned Hollywood with its phenomenal financial success, writer-director Oren Peli was propelled into the world of write your own paycheck for future endeavors. CHERNOBYL DIARIES is one of his latest efforts.Starting with its misleading title, the movie is a rather tedious, uninspired film. Although there are a couple tense moments, the movie limps along to predictable set pieces, with a nebulous and unsatisfying conclusion. And ask yourself: if you were touring Eurasia, would you really want to take a side tour of a radioactive deserted town? Not me!CHERNOBYL DIARIES is one of 2012's biggest financial misfires and certainly not a prominent entry on Peli's resume."
1,Typical,"Most of the ""horror"" is created by the characters stupidity, par for the course for recent horror. Three more words."
1,My fiancee said this movie sucked,"I didn't actually see this, but my fiancee said this movie is terrible. I seem to recall here saying it was one of those ""found footage"" horror movies that are all the rage these days. Don't see it."
1,Waste of time,"Honestly there's nothing worth writing about this movie. Its cliche, predictable, poorly executed. It has one of the stupidest plots to ever come out of Hollywood. Typical shaky-cam with attempts at cheap scares that don't work at all."
1,Absolutely Boring,"Save your money, a teenage sci fi flick. Poorly made and every more poorly acted. Not worth your time or trouble."
2,Dull,"With twenty minutes left in the movie, I didn't know the characters at all, knew what the ""bad guys"" were, the ending was totally predictable, and it wasn't even scary."
2,Blah,"This movie kinda sucked, I would not spend money watching it again. The idea of critter/humans...grosses me out. So good if you like weirdness in a way that is gross and not just interesting or strange."
3,Only if nothing else is on.,"Kinda of Cheesy, only watch if you have seen all the other scary movies, I hope this makes sense. Adding a word."
1,Horrible movie and horrible video quality,"Title pretty much says it all. I will not be renting anymore movies from amazon. Its not their fault the movie itself was bad, but the quality of the video made it annoying to watch! And this was supposively HD too! Wasnt my connection, I know that much, I have 30 MB internet download speed, and wasnt my equipment- I have 1080P projector. Blu Rays play perfectly on my setup, and even netflix non HD movies were better than this one from amazon was."
2,What the- huh?,What could have been a good concept was run into the ground literally. The entire movie all they did was run. What I thought was going to be a really creepy ghost story wasn't a ghost story. Hills Have Eyes type movie set in Russia. Very disappointed.
3,It was ok,I wasn't impressed with this movie...I rate this a 6 out of 10. It flipped flopped around and the best part was the ending.
2,Chernobyl,Not the best horror flick but worth a rent. Typical don't go in a scary place scenario especially in a foreign country.
3,Chernobyl Diaries,"Don't waste your money. B movie, wait until it hits cable. Looks good, but a total waste of time! Bad story."
3,Worth a look,If you are a fan of this genre then you'll probably like this one. It does a very good job of setting a bleak tone and mood and the location really helped out with that.
2,not good,"I was excited about seeing this movie - the previews for it made it look really interesting. However, I felt like it was quite predictable and boring."
3,Chernobyl Diaries,How can you take an otherwise imaginative plot and muck it up? The movie answers this question on its' own. I can see why no big-name stars are in it.
2,Disappointing,"It was full of ""scary"" scenes but the whole movie was very disappointing...especially after paying $3.99 to watch the movie. I definitely would NOT recommend it."
3,Anticlimactic,"This movie could have been a lot better. The only scary part happens at the end of the movie. It might be worth watching, but I wouldn't make it a priority."
3,Pretty Good Flick,"I was expecting it to be a little more, jump out and scare you type scary, but it wasn't. Overal, it wasn't bad. Not enough zombies for me."
3,Not bad,"Decent suspense and has some creepy moments, but came to an end pretty quick. Could have use more action, but for a few bucks, why not."
4,Chernobyl Diaries,My family thought the Chernobyl Diaries was definitely worth watching.It kept us on the edge of our seats.I would recommend it to anyone.
3,Did not like the plot and ending,It was not what I was expecting. The ending was very disappointing and it was a waste of money. There was something missing in the plot.
3,Predictable,"felt dragged out, as they spent so much time running from the mutants,getting picked off one at a time. Bored in the middle."
4,ok interesting,"It was a different movie enjoyable, not special not somthing I would be happy to see at theater or buy"
3,It was ok.,"This movie wasn't as good as the previews showed it to be, but it was fairly entertaining. There a few good scary scenes."
2,No New Information Here,This book is well written but adds nothing to the discussions around Outsourcing and the impact Globalization has had on the U.S. Economy. Not recommended for serious readers familiar with the issues.
2,often wrong but never in doubt,"There are a few authors, Leser Thurow, Jeremy Rifkin, and Clyde Prestowitz who are full of gloom and doom and usually wrong. In the 1980s it was Japan which was going to roll over America, now it is China and India. I expect that in another ten years it will be Brazil which will be the REAL threat. Prestowitz can't even get his quotes right (He has Colin Powell quoted when he really means--I think--Andy Grove). I suggest Tom Friedman's The World is Flat is a much better analysis of what faces America is the years ahead."
5,Nothing Better!,"i got curious and tried my boyfriends razor and trust me it gives the closest shave i have ever got. I used to use the Venus but now i just get the mach 3 blades and use it on my Venus handle, it works. It might be a bit pricey but it's definitely worth it and guys if it gi ves me a good shave imagine what it can do for you."
1,Great Label Information!!,"Gillette Mach3 CartridgeThis is just about the labeling, which is supposed to make it easier to compare unit prices. It says:""Gillette Mach3 Cartridge by GilletteBuy new: $20.10 $12.90 ($7.33/oz)""The per ounce measure really helps compare - I always buy razor blades by the ounce. No other blades at Amazon are priced by the ounce, as far as I can see. I think it's time for Amazon to take a more intrusive role in what its merchants post, since failures like this cannot help but diminish my respect for Amazon."
5,Jus Like any Other Razr!!!,It works like it is supposed to work i guess. Nothing special about it.......
5,Solid Book,"After having read all of David Eddings other books and for the most part enjoying them, I found myself faced with the pleasure of reading the redemption of althalus. This book is by far my favorite of all of his books. the main character is an absolute riot to follow through his many adventures and his supporting cast is well developed and enjoyable to read about as well. It was a nice change of pace to finnally get away from Belgarion. Perhaps the best praise i can give this book is that it has quickly become my favorite from amongst the eddingses publications and i have thoroughly enjoyed them all."
1,Time to rest on your laurels,"Unfortunately I found this book extremely poor. In comparison to the Belgariad which first influenced my enjoyment of reading, to the Mallorean which I enjoyed almost as much, it seems that David Eddings is trying to rehash a succesful formula and pass it on without much thought. A number of the above reviewers feel that it may appeal to the die hard Eddings fan. I hope that this is precisely the people that it will not appeal to, it certainly caused me to struggle all the way through. Additionally people mention the humour and one liners. Good luck to finding a single element of humour in the book not already tried a hundred times in the preceeding stories"
2,Potboiler,"Once again, the Eddings' create a deep, logical, fully realized primary fantasy world in which the cultures and institutions are unique and well-developed. Once again, they populate this world with the same characters acting the same way and saying the same things. Maybe it's just me, but it seems that any culture nominally at a medieval level would not allow its entire system of interpersonal communication to depend so heavily on the phrase ""sort of."" I keep hoping that the Eddings' will recapture whatever flair allowed them to breathe fresh life into the epic fantasy genre with the Belgariad...but it seems that's what their agent is expecting of me too.There's nothing new here."
2,Predictable,"I was a always a great fan of David Eddings and have read every one of his books. From the middle of the Mallorean series onwards, David Eddings started devoting more space to the actual romantic relationships between characters. To me, the redemption of Althalus is something between Belgariad and a cheap Mills and Boon novel. The story is sometimes tedious: the main characters continuously moving around the same house until the story becomes very predictable. The relationships between the characters is entirely on a romantic level and no importance is given to actual companionship.On the plus side, Eddings managed to merge time travel : a sci fi topic , with a classical fantasy which made the book quite interesting.In short, only buy this book if you are an ardous David Eddings fan, otherwise try Belgariad, which is definitely his greatest masterpiece."
2,Not as good as the other books,"I've read both the Belgariad and Mallorean series, and those are some of my favorite books. When I heard that the Eddings were publishing a new book, I thought it would surely be great. But I was wrong. There is no character developement; things just happen. You get the feeling that things are rushed. And everything's too perfect for the characters with the ""doors,"" allowing them to escape any dangerous situation at any time. I might be repeating this from other reviews, but there really is no suspense. Some of the ideas are thought-provoking like the doors and Gher. But some of the good characters really do annoy me when they explain things in such a childish manner. Things are too simple. Definitely not the authors' best work. It was a good plot overall, but not very compelling nor very exciting. I would stick to the Mallorean and Belgariad. Those are worth reading and buying."
1,Garbage!,"I cannot even express to you my extreme disappointment in this novel. I am a huge Eddings' fan and was eagerly anticipating a new book. I adored the Garion stories. Let me assure you -every single bad review listed before mine is %100 correct - ie. bad (oh my very bad) dialogue, bad plot, zero character development, choppy, uninteresting, cloying, etc. Pure stubborness drove me to finish this book but it only got worse as I continued to read.My only solace is that I borrowed the book from my public library and didn't shell out money for this tripe."
2,Disappointing,"I love David Eddings - ""The Belgariad"" series are among the most loved books of my vast collection, and so I purchased this book with frank expectation of a good read.It starts out well - our hero is well drawn and we are interested in his experiences. The other characters are introduced and we become interested in them as well. But somehow it just runs out of steam from there, and by the end I was simply pleased to be finished (I confess I did finish because I am one of those people who perservere unless a book is truly atrocious).Overall I was very disappointed. It is evident that Edding's still has the gift as the characters are well cast and interesting, but the battles are too long, and by the end I didn't care what happened to any of them.Stick to his earlier, far superior works."
2,"If you think the ""Belgariad"" was the finest work...","ever written in the english language, you will probably like this book. If you are like me, and just enjoy the Belgariad, Elenium and Tamuli, you will find it a pretty thin rehash of the earlier works. Their view of human interaction is very one dimensional, and becoming somewhat trite. Still, it has its moments, and will keep you entertained for a while. I would really like to see the writers stretch themselves and take a few chances, and maybe NOT have the main female be so condescending, and the men be so doltish."
1,What is this?,"I have been a big David Eddings fan for awhile and I love the Belgariad and the Mallorean series. So, when this new book came out, I rushed to buy the book and after a few hundred pages, I was so disappointed and disgruntled that I could not finish it. It seems to me that the authors are rehashing their old themes, and this time they did it in a very unimaginative and terrible way. For example, the Arends in the Belgariad and Mallorean series appeared to have resurfaced in the new book as the Arums. Characters are still being led around to do various little things by god-like beings, if not by the gods themselves. The writing, while not necessarily bad, did not keep me wanting to read more. All in all, I was terribly disappointed with this book. I'm probably better off re-reading the old series a few more times."
3,For Eddings Lovers who Don't Like Rocks,"If you have never read a book by Eddings, don't read this one first. His epic series are better as he excels in building characters over the long haul. However, if you like the authors' writing style but are tired and blue and red rocks come read this one. The characters are recycled and the hero still has a ridiculous amount of power to smooth over plot problems but when the characters are as good as Eddings' always are I am willing to overlook it. Even Eddings recycled plot and characters are better than many author's attempts at originality. A good, and for once short, fantasy work but if you're looking for the Eddings at their best, keep looking."
1,Terrible book,This is the worst book of the genre that I have ever read and I enjoyed most of the other offerings by Eddings despite the fact that most of his stories all have essentially the same plot. I had bought all of his other books as they came out but that ended once I read this.
1,What a waste of time!,Ill keep this short not to waste more time. This book ...! It starts well and is interesting at the begining but the story deteriorates quickly! I am suprised it was published! Stay away from this book.
3,OK but I doubt I'll finish it,"I got this book among 5 others for christmas and I was taken in by the ""#1 International Bestseller"" on the cover. I started to read it, and it seemed pretty good, and I kept reading, and it still seemed just pretty good. So I put it down and picked up something else.The character of Althalus is interesting, but something just doesn't click here. I'm just not interested in what happens, and the lovey-dovey talk between him and his pet ""cat"" get annoying."
2,Every character is the same!,"Like many others I was really looking forward to another Eddings book. I'm almost done with it now, but the only reason I'm even bothering to finish it is because I always finish books. Every single character in the book, whether male or female, young or old, immortal or mortal has the same exact personality. They are all the same person. It's so incredibly obvious I can't believe the authors didn't realize it and stop it. I realize they are trying to make it a humorous book - but when everybody constantly makes the same kinds of remarks, jokes, wisecracks, etc, it gets old quickly. It could have been an interesting story if there was more than one character in the tale and if some work had been done on the plotline."
1,Horrible horrible horrible,"I'm a huge fantasy fan and this has to be my biggest disappointment to date, I've never been a big Eddings follower but his books have kept me entertained. Have to agree with a previous review that it seems as if it was written by somebody else.. it's as if another person wrote it for kids learning to read/speak English, having been instructed to base it on Eddings' previous material. The dialogue is lame, lame, lame, the jokes are weak.. the magic is boring ... there is no depth, it's just so damn boring! Sorry about this rant - I would never pull someone's work apart if I never knew what they were capable of, but Eddings treats his readership like a bunch of dimwits in trying to pass this off as a serious work (No. 1 Bestseller?) - I doubt I'll ever read another one of his books, this leaves such a bad taste in my mouth, and I feel sorry for those giving it a glowing report, you need to expand your fantasy horizons a little ... Ugh."
1,So bad it left me hostile,"Other reviews have really said it all. Horrible writing. Stereotyped characters that have the most trite and repetitive of dialog. Boring. Offensively stupid. Glaring plot holes. Ridiculously overpowered, unchallenged heroes. The list goes on and on. I'm ashamed that I read the whole thing. The last line made me throw the book, first against the wall and then away."
2,"Same old, same old.","Straight off, let me tell you that if you've never read an Eddings book before, you'll probably enjoy this. David and Leigh have a unique style of writing, and a wicked sense of sarcastic humor that you won't find elswhere....WHY did Althalus have to be a character so similar to Begarath? Emmy reminds me much too sharply of both Polgara and Sephrenia. The plot (save the world from an evil god through a major battle or two at the end, with the help of some gods/friends) and everything else about this book conspires to have me compare it to the others I have read, where it fails miserably.I never would have thought I'd hear myself saying it, but there is such a thing as an overdose of Eddings humor. And while The Redemption of Althalus may have made an excellent series, sadly in its compacted form it's merely a depthless imitation of David Eddings' previous books.Buy at your own risk, yee readers of Garion and Sparhawk."
1,Dreadful,"I couldn't finish this book. The plot is silly beyond belief, the characterization as thin as the paper on which the paperback edition is printed, and the quality of writing is awful."
2,"David Eddings, Lite Version","This might be a good book to introduce someone to Edding's writing style, it's all there, little bits of humor and all. It's not as intimidating as four volumes, and it spins along at a good clip. A ""seasoned"" Edding's fan will be disappointed though. To shorten the long travel times, a device is used. I call it a ""T.A.R.D.I.S."" which is what the famous time traveler ""Dr. Who"" rode around in. It looks like a blue phone booth, but ""it's bigger on the inside than on the outside"". The TARDIS flies through time and space, as does Edding's version, which is simply called ""the House"". Speaking of time: Two thousand years pass and the kingdoms are still the same kingdoms as before. The general language hasn't shifted, and Althalus can fit right in without any troubles. He doesn't even get lost on roads that weren't around when he was around two thousand years earlier! There are other, quibbling things, but enough's enough. Pick this one up for a quick, light read."
1,I feel unclean.,"Save your time. Save your money.By 50 pages into it and on through the end, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't identify with a single character.Little plot. No tension. No danger. No subtlety.Run, reader. Run for your life."
1,A Shame.,"I don't have a lot of time to waste on this book, so I will make this short. There is nothing new here. There are no new characters, themes, or situations. This is simply a mule we've ridden before, but this time it is dressed up in horse harness. If you are a die-hard Eddings fan, this book MAY be worth the money. I am (or was) a die-hard Eddings fan, and I don't think this book was worth the money. If you simply have to have this book, wait until it is released in paperback."
1,So very bad.,"Do not waste your money of this garbage! It is supposed to be by David and Leigh Eddings. It is not! It is only Leigh Eddings, and clearly she has no talent! I think David has been putting her name on with his just to be nice!"
1,Oh my GOD!!!!,"I have NEVER quit reading a fantasy book but this is an exception. My first ever fantasy author was Eddings and I lived in the great worlds that he created but many years (and authors)on I can't believe he could/would write such childism [junk]!.The book starts off well, good plot/characters but it slowly goes downhill. I wanted to like this book so much 'cause of Eddings other great books but it was like wadding knee deep in thick mud.Anyone who thought this book was even moderatly good is very very sad."
1,Save your money,I hae read almost everything by the eddings. This was a major disappointment. I will never be taken in again by the eddings. This book is not worth the money spent. It is not worth going to the library to read. I am a serious fantasy reader and I have read most of the fantasy books published. This one is terrible.
2,Rehash,"You can pick out the characters from Eddings' other novels in this one. He does the same gathering-of-group, the same group dynamics, the same jokes, the same words. (I'm amazed at the number of times his editors let him use ""peculiar"" in one paragraph, or repeat the formula ""Tom says something off-the-wall. Joe looks at Tom 'helpless' and laughs, shaking his head."")It's worth a weekend read, but certainly not worth buying. And it will probably leave you feeling unfulfilled and cold. Stick with the Belgariad, where his ideas were fresh and creative; this is just rehash of rehash. He tells a good story, but his writing craft isn't very strong, and when he lacks original plot elements, it shows."
1,"If you like Eddings, don't read this book.","I have read the vast majority of Eddings' books and his stregths have always been character development, character interaction and great story lines. This was lacking in all three. You hardly find out anything about any of the characters. The character interaction is shallow. People that rightfully hate each other, quickly fall in love. Everyone you meet ends up quickly married. And for the story line, it has 3 endings and has to restart the story each time. The good guys and bad guys are trite and have no history with each other."
2,"Emmy, Althie, Daddy....for the love of Pete stop the torture","Avoid this book like the plague! I love the Belgariad and the Mallorean. This time, however, Eddingses (their spelling not mine) have really elevated regurgitation to a new level. By compacting all of their previous epics into a 700 page snore fest, the duo may have finally alienated me from their works.Be especially cognizant of the fact that the same bad joke is repeated every 15 pages by any number of characters. Several characters are written completely inconsitently (Gher can't remember people's names, but can calculate supposedly complex temporal theories). Take the advice of other reviewers and reread the Belgariad. Stay away from this manure pile. I'll thank the Eddings to put more effort and inteligence into their future works if they want to continue selling novels on the value their good name."
4,another great Eddings masterpiece,"I'm in the process of reading every book that David and Leigh Eddings have ever writtenI read this book when i first came out and truly enjoyed it .Like most of Edding's books, The Redemption of Althalus uses strong humor and its writing will win most readers over. The book is written lightly, but the villians are as evil as they come. If you are looking for a light, in terms of reading not weight, then I suggest this book."
3,"Can we say ""guilty pleasure""?","I'll keep this short and simple...like the book except that it was longer....i think. Anyhow, I love Eddings. I've read just about everything that I could lay my grubby hands upon (yay!! improper english!!!!). I found the book highly entertaining. Yes, it was predictable and the good guys seemed to be extremely powerful. But that sort of thing just doesn't happen in every book. It's usually the bad guys being the more powerful and by luck or pure strength of character that the good guys prevail. This book seems to do away with that notion. This is a more lighthearted fanatasy unlike the ones you would find in Jordan or Goodkind. In the end, I don't think the type of fantasy found in Redemption of Athaltus would suit me on a regular basis but it's great to read once in a while."
4,what's all the fuss about?,"I guess I don't see what all the fuss is about. Some critics are whining that this book doesn't follow the tradition of writing style set forth by Eddings in ""Belgariad"" & ""Mallorean"". So? It's a completely different novel, and as such has merit all it's own. I thought the plot and character development was strong. It kept me entertained, and that's all I care about in the sci-fi/fantasy genre. I thought the story line was plausible, and enjoyed the ""doors"" theme of distance and time travel. If you're looking for a rehash of ""Belgariad"" & ""Mallorean"", why not reread those books? I reread ""The Hobbit & Lord of the Rings"" yearly."
2,A hash of his previous books,"As I read through the book, I repeatedly noticed compounded elements from every one of Eddings' previous books. Phrases, characters, and plot have been transplanted whole and mashed into a book which, although having its good points, overall drags. Longtime readers of Eddings will be bored silly, as they will recognize every character and half of the dialogue."
2,A let down,"In short, a disappointment. Althalus read more like a child's rushed story than an epic fantasy novel. The dialogue was forced and simple, and the plot was rather unimaginative. The must frustrating part of the book was that every plan they team of heroes and heroines devised always worked without flaw. There was never any suspense created, and the book ended without fanfare and without climax. I would suggest that epic fantasy fans turn instead to Terry Brooks' latest Shannara works."
1,I could only get about half way through,"I'm new to the world of fantasy literature. I am sorry that this book was the first one that I picked up. I read through the first chapter in the book store and decided to buy it. After a while, I found myself struggling to stay interested. There are too many underdeveloped characters. The Eddings seem to throw them at you all at once. Before you know it, you have no idea as to what is going on. I got as far as part two, then moved on to something else. Save your money."
2,Interesting but lacking,"I have read all the Eddings series. I found each exciting and myself rivited to the end. His writings are very visual. I could see each charactor and action as it is carried out. I do not feel the same with Althalus. It is an interesting story but lacking the depth of his other series. I would call it a shadow and a mirror image of his other novels. I found the plot, very Saturday morning serial, the charactors composits of previous charactors. I feel let down by one of my favorite authors."
2,It's like putting on a pair of old sneakers,"Reading this book was like putting on a pair of comfortable old sneakers. The sneakers may have holes in the soles and the laces are broken, but you like them because they are familiar and comfortable.This book did not explore any new issues. (One reviewer mentioned the twist of time travel, but if you want time travel explored, read a good SF novel.) The characters were very similar to other characters in the Eddings' other books in that they have the same anachronistic mannerisms and ways of speaking (""That'll do."" ""Be nice."") and stereotypes (the people from the north are Viking barbarians, the people from the south are vapid nobles).Even so, it wasn't a terrible book because the story moved along at a good pace and reading it was like having a reunion with old pals whose company you enjoy, but whose quirks can sometimes annoy you if you spend too long with them."
3,Good.....Not Great,"I hadn't even heard that the Eddings' were releasing this book i just saw it and bought it.. I have read every title that they have released on average about 6 times each and have been absolutely captivated by them. But I have to say this is not their best work. I did however like it enough to enjoy the book. As was put in another review of this book ""it gave me a fantasy fix without the commitment of a series"". A series would have probably turned out a little better, but with what was done I am pleased. Now if you are an avid reader of David and Leigh Eddings, as I am, then you will more then likely enjoy the book, if not you may end up a little disappointed. But who knows you may enjoy it and if you havent read the others you may decide to read them as well."
4,perhaps we are expecting a bit much,"Yes the charachters are the same, and yes the plot is not one of the most original. However, the book is enjoyable and would have been better recieved if the authors had just used the same familiar names from the previous novels. In all, read the book for fun after you borrow it from your local library."
2,Not One Of His Best,"I picked up this book thinking I was in for a treat. An author I enjoyed and a compact novel, without having to read through an entire series to see how thing ended. What a disappointment! The character of the gods in the stories is really a disappointment. They give humans the abilities to do all of these great things (time travel) but why do that? Why not just take care of things themselves? The evil characters are so stupid as to be totally unbelievable. The other characters are very one dimensional and very much sterotypes. About midway through the book, I simply gave up. I usually hate to do that after I had already invested so much time but I just did not see any benefit to finishing the book."
1,Very disappointed,"Unfortunately, I am forced to agree with those who didn't like this book. I am a BIG Eddings fan and have read (and reread) the Belgariad/Malloreon and the Elenium/Talium more times than I can count and loved them all. I bought The Redemption of Althalus with a great deal of enthusiam and optimism. However, I found the book to be boring in the extreme. The characters weren't the least bit interesting, there wasn't much in the way of conflict, and it really seemed like Eddings was rushing to get everything into one book. I would definitely NOT recommend this book."
2,predictable,"I love david and leigh eddings. However, this book was just annoying. The characters were all one dimensional and their main function was to deliver ""funny"" one liners. The book started off pretty good, but about 3/4 of the way through i stopped reading. It was just very boring and predictable. Don't waste your money."
1,A Huge Disappointment,"I'm a real fan of the Eddings'Belgariad series, which were original and had terrific character and plot development. I was disappointed when the series ended. Then came the Mallorean, essentially a rehash of the first books but still readable and entertaining, however, all of Mr. Eddings books since the Belgariad have gone down in quality and content and this is by far the worst! All the characters from this book are just a rehash of characters from previous books and much too predictable. The sarcastic, trite dialog between the characters has become so tedious it's painful to read. And that whole ""daddy"" thing with Althalus, what's with that? Don't waste your money or your time with this one."
1,Terrible...,"I have also been a huge Eddings fan, and always reference Eddings' Belgariad series to all who want to be introduced to Fantasy. After all, Eddings was the first Fantasy author I ever read - and I've read no other genre since. That's why I am sad at having to agree with the negative reviews posted here. This truly was a terrible book... As I read it I kept thinking ""this is bad"", but I kept right on reading it, hoping it would get better. Half-way through it, however, I put away any expectations I had, and struggled to finish it.I would never recommend this book to anyone. Specially not anyone who has never read an Eddings book. I want to give him a second chance."
1,Belgariad/Mallorean Meets Elenium/Tamuli,"Silk, Vella and Eriond team up with Sephrina, Katlten and the various churches. Well, not literally, but close enough to make Redemption an insult to fans of Eddings prior works.Character traits and politics from both series (Belgariad/Mallorean& Elenuim/Tamuli) were woven into an uneven and lumpy tapestry called 'The Redemption of Althalus.'The new ideas and concepts within Redemption have outstanding story potential that eventually gets lost within the recycled ingredients from the Eddings earlier works. Redemption has no surprises for the reader. Even those few situations that are not completely explained leave nothing that might surprise a reader.New readers are strongly urged to read Eddings other works and old fans are encouraged to stay away. With luck, the Eddings will forget about the world they created in Redemption and move on to unpoisoned pastures in future works.Very disappointing."
1,Predictible,"I am a David Eddings fan. I have read everything he has published. I can't in good conscience rate this book any higher. The problem is that it reads like his other series. The one thing I can say about Eddings was that his characters came alive before me, but this time it reads like a reencarnation of characters from his previous books. I know none of the characters may have the same name, but they have the same personality as previous books; the country may be different, but the terrain is the same; the events may be different, but the obsession with a pattern still exists. The good point about this book is that it seems to be a stand alone novel."
4,Sweet but short,Being a huge fan of David Eddings' novels I knew what to expect from this story. I got everything I expected both good and bad. The good ....the typical Eddings story of the common man (or woman)facing the strugle of good vs evil...the endearing quality of the authors characterizations....the relative shortness of this novel compared to his other trilogys...the acnowledgement of his wife as co-author. The bad...predictability.....the shortness. For fans either of the fantasy genre or the author this is a must buy. This is also a good buy for those NOT SO INTO THE GENRE it has more mass apeal mainly due to its shortness. WELL WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION FOR ALL.
2,Another review for a bad book from a good author,"Simply put, the book was terrible.The hero uninteresting, unlikeable, and makes a miraculous transformation in to Belgarath from the Belgariad series in a matter of a few pagesThe supporting Cast: From eddings earlier series too, nothing new here.The dialogue: Read the belgariad, and find the same dialogue in a much better bookThe plot: What plot?The villians: Who are these evil people. No development, they just appear when eddings needs a bad guy, and dissapear just as fast. They have no real motivation, and are are so undeveloped that you cant even call them one dimensionalThe world: No development here eitherGo Read the Belgariad or Elenium..thier much better books"
4,Good read but I've had better,"Well, considering that this book was written by David Eddings, I would have to start by saying that it is a good read. However, due to the length of the text, it dragged on a bit. Although it is very interesting at the beginning, (when we see the life of Althalus) the remainder of the book is hard to follow. Instead of a straightfoward plot, we are confronted with twists and turns that quickly become annoying. Ok, so the initial consept is great, but it was a touch overwritten.As much as I am picking on it, I would have to say that it is all in all a good read. I recommend it to any Eddings fans, but only if you think you will be able to keep the plot sraight."
2,maybe if you've never read eddings before...,"i found this book incredibly disappointing (and fairly boring... the only reason i finished it is because i was on a plane with nothing else to read)... perhaps if you've never read any of eddings' books before, you might be entertained, but for fans, this book is simply a (very long) retread of previous books. plot has never been the focus of eddings' work; it's the characters and the interaction between them that is the most interesting. unfortunately, every one of the characters in this book is a direct ripoff from a character from previous books, or, at best, an easily recognizable combination... even to the extent where the *dialogue* is identical and some recognizable character traits from previous books are reused. not worth your time."
1,Almost the worst book I've ever read...,I am SUCH a big fan of Eddings work too. I've read everything he's written and found it totally enchanting. But this book just reads like he took his two other major series and smushed them together. I feel like I've already met all the characters beforePerhaps he's just run out of creativity and material but I've never been so disappointed.
1,Horrid,"I gave him another chance. I really did. The first few pages weren't bad. But it didn't get better and soon I was slogging through the completely predictable plot, groaning at the cardboard characters and their cookie-cutter dialog (the same lame jokes, arguments, and coy teasing over and over again) until I finished and reswore my vow to never read another word of Eddings again.This book is a waste of money and trees."
2,Subpar Eddings,"I am an avid Eddings fan, and I was disappointed with this book. It appeared to me that maybe the book was released a bit prematurely. The magic involved was too easy for the good guys, and the bad guys could not do anything right. It was also predictable. The plot was still good, typical Eddings, but the writing was not up to standard. Eddings is a master, I just get the impression that the publisher rushed him on this one."
1,Rehash Redux,"What a cynical book. What cynical authors. Is it possible to plagerize yourself? What an interesting concept, create stock characters, slap new names on them and use them over and over again. The Belgariad was a nice first try, the Mallorean pushed the concept. Changing the names of the characters and barely changing the setting was inexcusable for the Elenium. Redemption though, well this is a travesty. The main character called ""Althalus""-- this time-- is Silk from the Belgariad. Dweia is Polgara. Andine is etc., etc. Each character matches up neatly with one from an earlier series. Geesh, even the dialogue has been lifted intact in some cases from earlier works. Hey, if you are going to recycle characters could they at least change the milieu? Let's throw them on a spaceship next! If not anything else, can they proofread the next one at least? This was just a horrible, cynical, money making enterprise."
2,Oh no not again,"I really wanted this book to be different from the last several that the Eddings's have written. No such luck. The book started well, but rapidly went downhill. The characters were boring, and I really just wanted them all to die, the universe would have been better off withouth them. In all avoid this book"
1,Long and Bleak,"One of the bad books that I read in my life unfortunately. Although I read Fantasy & sci-fi a lot, i never tried David Eddings before. This book made me happy about not trying him at all. Plot is weak, characters are weak, jokes are repetitive, far from giving a hint of smile and there is simply to many of them. Characters are acting like they are running a stand-up comedy show. i hope somebody WILL NOT make a movie of this book. I'll stick with LOTR.I'll read the comments next time before I buy a book."
2,Not Edding's best,"When Belgarath & Polgara came out I bought them in HC first (I had more money then) and devoured them each in one sitting. I was expecting more from Redemption than what I got. The characters are derivative (did anyone else keep getting hung up on Khalad/Khalor?) and the dialogue tried to be sparkling and witty but somehow fell short. Nothing sticks in my mind from Redemption and yet the scene where Ce'Nedra first gives birth still makes me snicker.It's rather depressing because we KNOW the Edding's are capable of much better writing than this. I will be buying this in paperback, perhaps it will read a little better without the fever pitch of anticipation."
1,One star is TOO good for this thing.,"I can't believe I spent money and time on this. I should get some sort of reward for even finishing it.The dialog was too embarrassing to even read. Funny? Not at all. All the characters speak like smart mouthed 8 year olds. The same poor attempts at jokes are used in each chapter by each character. Sadly, they were not even funny the first time they were used.Plot summary: The good guys can go anywhere in time and space and accomplish anything by saying magic words. The bad guys have exactly the same powers but are stupid."
5,Loved This Book. . .but. . .,"As much as I loved this book and it's characters, personally I don't think it's up to par with Mr. & Mrs. Eddings' previous work. I completely respect their decision not keep writing books about the same characters over and over again. I also think that was the right decision. So I am not lamenting that is was not another Garion or Sparhawk novel. I got the feeling this book was ""hurried"" that it could have been more than one volume and they simply ""made"" it one. Perhaps I am being too harsh, I have only read it once and I will again soon to be double sure, but those were my first reactions."
2,This really goes on for WAY too long,"I found myself finishing this one not because I wanted to see how it ended, but rather after 500 pages I felt like ""...I've already gone this far.""Bit of background...I've read all of the Belgarion and Sparhawk novels, as well as The Losers, Belgarath, and Polgara so I know the style. Amusing but sometimes repetitive narration centered around lovable and interesting characters. I was very pleased to meet some new players, and I admire that they wanted to keep it to one novel this time, but concepts are not explored and characters are not developed enough in what could have been at least a trilogy. Instead of wanting more, I was left wanting the novel to just get on with it. This may have been solved with smaller doses (or episodes), because although I enjoyed it, it was simply played out after the first 600+ pages."
1,Not a winner,"David Eddings is one of my favorite writers and I have never been disappointed until this book came along. The names are awkward, the story is so convoluted it is almost impossible to follow, and the dialog and smart-guy comments come right from the pages of the Sparhawk books. No one can crank out a winner EVERY time, but David Eddings comes close. So we can forgive him this dog and hope for better next time."
2,No,"No, this one was not by far what I expected from it. A disappointment, that took to long to read through. After the first 100 pages, you think that it will get better, but it doesn't, at least not much. Ofcourse, the signals of an Eddings novel can be found, but as others wrote before: it is not very renewing,not sparkling and certainly not something you would expect from mister Eddings. I was glad that I finished it, to move on to something better."
5,Highlights,"This is the word I must to say about this book - highlights to the works of Eddingses. The best of. Funny, adventurous, with wonderful characters. What more to want?Great book."
4,other reviewers blow it out your ear!!!!,"I've been reading eddings works since I was fifteen. I loved his work then i still love it including the Althalus book.First let me just say that this is steeped in real myth,and think that those that did not like it probably never read any of the myths from the Far East and didn't understand how the characters interacted with one another as if one had actually read about three hindu gods one a creator,one a preserver,and one a destroyer might.If you look up any of the names, Nagaharesh is the hindu city of demons and Daeva is demon in Hindu."
1,More of the same,"Eddings repeats more of the same kind of plot he used in his other series. As a fan who had collected all his works, I should say that this book is nothing new and nothing interesting."
2,A link,"This book provides the Eddings with a mechanism to link Garion with Sparhawk and that's about all. A House that can link anywhere to anywhere, anywhen.This book has some original stuff, but it's nearly lost amidst all the repetition. However, after 18 books a lot of plot devices, characterisations and outcomes are going to be familiar."
3,Decent,"It seems that old age is starting to wear on our dear Mr. Eddings, or perhaps he's just burnt out after the spectacluar Belgariad/Mallorean saga. He seems to have used up all his good characters there, in any case. In this book we met Belgarath, Polgara, Ce'nedra, and Garion again in the forms of Althalus, Dweia, Andine, and Eliar. The only problem was that our new friends weren't nearly as well developed as the old versions, which goes for all of the Redemption characters. He went into a little depth with Leitha and Khalor, but left the others hanging. Plus, there wasn't really much drive behind our so-called protagonist's quest. I found I didn't really care if Daeva won out in the end, mostly because well, what is Daeva anyway? We're supposed to fear him and his underlings, but Eddings never really shows us why. Also, Eddings throws magic around pretty carelessly here, which is something he explicitly warned against in the Rivan Codex. All in all, a fun read, but disapointing and shallow."
1,Rehashed story line,"The other reviews say it all. Eddings has rehashed his story line, syntax and characters yet once again. Time for him to quit his day job."
3,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~,"The Redemption Of Althalus was fairly good but i would rate it 3 stars compared to other books that he has written. Frankly i found that it resembled the Belgariad series a lot. The story was similar and the characters were almost exactly like the characters of the belgariad. For example, Althalus resembled Belgarath, and Andine resembled Ce'Nedra, and of course Eliar was almost exactly like Garion. Of course they all looked physically different but their personalities were very close. Overall, i liked the book but prefer the Belgariad series by far."
3,Somewhat mediocre.,"I have been a fan of the Eddings' books ever since I read ""Pawn of Prophecy"", the first book of the Belgariad. From there I read the Mallorean and the related books, and then the Ellenium and the Tamuli. I really enjoyed all of those books, so I bought this book hoping that is would be as good. Unfortunately, it was was just so-so. I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't horrible or even bad; it just wasn't up to par with the standards of their previous books. While I don't bemoan the time I spent reading this book, ""The Redemption of Althalus"", I probably won't ever read it again, unlike their other works, which I've read at least 3 times each and will read again in the future."
2,Wouldn't return to it,"I agree with the other one- and two-star reviewers, so I won't go into detail about the plot, or lack thereof. The book lacked depth or solidity, the characters were undeveloped and their problems seemed to disappear instantaneously. The only reason I bought it was because it allegedly featured Emerald the cat. She was fine when she was a bossy little feline, but when she revealed herself as Dweia ... hmm.I'm not a big Eddings fan at all. I've read his Sparhawk trilogy and this seemed like an even thinner, more watered-down version of it. The characters seemed so much the same. (His women are particularly annoying: cutesy goddesses/queens wear out their welcome very quickly.)There was no real sense of peril. Everything was far too easy for the heroes. They need to get something done? Fine, just go back in time with your army, no problem. Or use a magic word. Or whatever. Froth and bubble, this one, I'm afraid."
2,The Mighty have Fallen,"I loved the Belgariad, the Mallorean, and both Sparhawk series. I enjoyed The Losers and High Hunt. I even read the Rivan Codex! And I cannot believe how badly Eddings has let us down with this one. Dialogue attrition (he said, she said, he yelled) in this new book is absolutely shocking. ""He grated out""? Please. Characters are one dimensional, and they have the same conversations over and over again. Poorly thought out, poorly written, and not worth the time it took to read. If you're an Eddings fan, don't bother."
2,What was that,I usually liked Eddings work but this one is the worst I `ve ever read by him. It was like Eddings was trying to break my nerves. After tremendous effort I finally finished this book and I was totally disappointed. Hopefully the next book will be better.
2,Awful,"I was a big fan of David Eddings through the Belgarion Series, but I believe that he will never live up to that level again. This book was very weak in it's story line. It had no build up to the end of the book. The characters are shallow. I wouldn't even recommend reading this book at all."
2,Meh. A nice little story.,"There really isn't a lot to say about this book. I never really achieved a sense of ownership, or belonging to the story or the characters.Weak character development, convenient plot hole fills, and an overall lack of suspense or jeopardy work together to make this tale a colorless, pithy novel."
4,"Okay, lets be fair","So this book isn't up to par with some of Eddings other books, and neither does it compare to George RR Martin... but thats a whole other league! This book, is actually fairly enjoyable, and I would call it a ""light"" fantasy novel, but fun from start to finish."
4,so much fun,"I agree with another reviewer that too many people are giving this book a bad rap! Yes this book is similar to the plot of ""The Belgariad"" but so what!?! God forbid a FANTASY story have the plot line of ""Man and group of friends embark on quest to stop and evil god and his minions w/help from a god god"". I mean if a reacuring plot was a crime half of the greatest books ever writen would be considered trash!!! Yes, it seems worse because Mr. Eddings also wrote ""The Belgariad"", but so what, this book has enough originality to make it good. This book was simply a blast to read. I highly recomend this book to anyone who enjoys humor, action, fantasy, and a lil romance."
5,"Too short, but enjoyable....","I would have to say that I really enjoyed this book. Since starting to read Fantasy's, I have come to enjoy the 'series' of books. Whether there are only three (Dragonlance Chronicles) or nearing a dozen (Wheel of Time)...I have enjoyed being able to follow one or more characters on the journey through life. When I picked up 'Redemption of Althalus' I wasn't sure if I was going to like it because of it being a single book. After I was finished reading the book, I knew I would reread it again in the future. David Eddings made all of the characters enjoyable to read about and with. The witty remarks from all corners of the book made me laugh in many places. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Edding's work or Fantasy in general."
1,A truly sad decline of a gifted writer,"Despite the creation of what is to Mr.Eddings a new universe, the plot, the characterizations, the dialogue all are reminiscent of his previous works. It is time for Mr. Eddings, now joined by his wife, to stop mining an increasingly barren field and strike out in a truly original direction."
4,Thrilling but Cliche,"I must say that Yes! Eddings has done it again! Anyone even the slightest bit familiar with The Bellgariad or The Mallorean will once again be launched into a new and mystical world filled with magic and suspense. However, I must give this book 4 stars mainly because Eddings ""style"" is pretty predictable. You have the mystical object intended to kill the enemy, an evil God seeking the destruction of the world, and a diverse group of companions along the way. It basically follows the same outline of all his other books, so not many new surprises. Anyways, I am sure that all true avid readers of Eddings will enjoy this new addition to his GREAT collection (too bad it's not part of a series!)."
1,I didn't think that David was capable of this...,"and apparently he wasn't. I am confident that Leigh had the lion's share of involvement with this work and is trying to use her husband's fame to elevate sales of this abysmal book. For a first-time reader, DO NOT allow this poorly written excuse for literature to turn you away from David's earlier work, particularly the Belgariad and Mallorean. I have never before been in a position in which I have truly despised a book I bought for myself. Enough vituperations...you get the point."
1,"A painful read, at best","Somehow, I managed to finish this book. I read a lot at work out of boredom. However, I would almost have preferred sitting on my behind, twiddling my thumbs, staring off into space with drool running down my chin rather than read this book. I'm not a picky person, either. Just about anything will satisfy me. But this story just dragged on and on and on and on... the endless dialogue nearly drove me insane. I've never read a book where so many people just talked and talked. I'd say 95% of the book was dialogue, with the other 5% describing how the dialogue was spoken. The only reason this book got ONE star was because this book COULD have been interesting. I liked the idea behind the story... but the manner in which it was carried out -- not so much. Needless to say, I won't be buying another book by these authors."
1,"Sorry, it sucks","Although it has the makings of a good story, I found this book almost painful to read. It starts strong, with an intresting charecter, and an interesting situation, but just ruins every little bit of pleasure in reading this book once it introduces the other charecters. Even worse than the predictable story, is the horribly redundant and annoying dialogue. Although I started out liking these characters, by half way through the book I wanted them dead just so I wouldn't have to read their inane chatter. I really think it could have been a fun book to read, if some time had been spent to develop the characters, and to improve their dialogue."
2,You read it before......,"In all honesty, I enjoyed reading this book but to be equally honest, I read it all before. This book seem to be written in the exact same prose, style and concept as most of David Eddings' works that came before it. I was almost expecting Belgarath or Sparhawk to pop out somewhere but too bad they didn't show up. The plot, the story or the characters were not very original. It seem that David Eddings have lost his creative genius and seem to be recycling his earlier works all over again. Instead of taking several books, he does it all in one this time around. If he was in such a rut, maybe he should write another Belgarath novel or something since he seem unable start sometime totally new."
2,"More David, Less Leigh Please","This book didn't strike me as anything close to David Eddings works. I hugely enjoyed The Belgariad and The Mallorean but this seemed more along the lines of mediocre fanfiction. If I had to make a guess, I'd say this was written more by Leigh, riding on the coattails of famous husband, David. Some slight David Eddings flavors here and there, but overall I thought it amaturish. How sad."
4,The Redemption of Althalus,"I feel for those of you who could not make it through the entire novel. It is my guess that you probably prefer writers like Robert Jordan who write such complex characterizations, plotlines, and descriptive settings as to make me prefer the comfort and reading ease of my molecular genetics textbook. I will not deny that Althalus has its problems. It seems to draw characters and setting from several other Eddings novels. However, it is still and good read for pure entertainment, and that's really what we read for. If you examine the differences between the Belgariad and Mallorean series, and the Elenium and Tamuli series that followed, you will notice that there are many character similarities there as well. Perhaps when Jordan is finished with his Wheel of Time series (likely never) and he begins to develop new characters (the extreme tedium of that) we will see if he deviates from the norm or goes in a new direction not knowing if he will maintain his fan base."
2,Not Their Best Work,"This felt very hurried to me on several different levels. I'm not sure why the Eddings felt they needed to write a complete story in one book. Was it to prove they could? There were several loose ends left, and I think character developement suffered.The last 150 or so pages made no sense to me, why was it necessary to go back and play with time at the end?As far as the charcters were concerned, most of them were rehashes of other characters. I noticed particularly that Andine became more and more like Ce'Nedra as the book went along, right down to her physical size and personality.I enjoy the Eddings' previous works and I hope to see a new fantasy world created by them in the future; but this book will be far down on my reread list."
3,Problems in Redemption of Althalus,"Other reviews have pointed out problems in the predictable plot and wooden characters in this book, so I'll focus on a different problem exacerbated in this book by its length. There is a constant repetition of stock words and phrases throughout the book (and indeed in all their books) that grows quite annoying. Somtimes it appears that each character takes a turn in repeating stock phrases from a list - for example, when an older male character expresses deference to a younger female, odds are the female will say something like ""I just love this man, don't you?"". Cute the first time, tiresome the seventh time. The first third of the book is interesting and well-paced - the rest is a drag."
2,Not even close to what Eddings is capable of...,"OK, so if this was the first book by Eddings you've ever read, it's probably an ok run-of-the-mill fantasy. But if you're a diehard Eddings fan and you've read the Belgariad, the Mallorean, the Elenium, and the Tamuli....this...this is a load of crap.I don't know what happened between publishings, but Eddings' quality has gone down SO much. This and the new Dreamers saga? Crap. All the same tired cliches are used over and over, and all the characters start to look the same. I read this book a while ago and just now decided to review, and what does it say that NOTHING at all stands out about this book? I barely even remember reading it. The characters aren't likeable, they don't have any distinguishing traits, and Althalus is a little too much like Belgarath from the Belgariad/Mallorean for my liking. Can't Eddings come up with another plot device?"
1,"Unimaginative, boring tripe.","Looking for a good book to pass the summer away?Look farther.This book is a compilation of self-contradictions, weak characters, and a really, REALLY boring plot. The writing is essentially weak, the dialogue and descriptions are terrible.The book sounded like it had potential, but it was one of the most worthless and unimaginative fantasy novels I've ever read. Save the time you'd spend reading this book and do something more interesting with it -- like smacking yourself on the head with a hammer."
5,wonderful book,"I love this book! I first saw it several years ago but didn't have the money to buy it. Then I wished later I had bought it (this was before Amazon came along). Thank goodness for Amazon because now I have this wonderful book! It's an ""interactive"" book, with pull-outs like a sample of what a letter from Ireland to the US was like, and a sample of a ticket at Ellis Island. That sort of thing. It's interesting! All Celtophiles should have this book!"
1,Overpriced,Nice book but way overpriced. There is very little content for the serious researcher. Mostly fluff.
5,Walking on clouds,"Well made, beautiful shoes, and extremely comfortable. Don't know how great they are until you own them."
4,"Bought a bunch, one fell smooth apart out of the package as if never assembled",Bought these to use on baseboard heaters. They are 240 VAC and we were tired of the heaters being on the walls year round. Makes cleaning around them easier in spring when you can just unplug them and store them till winter.
4,I liked this product for many reasons. It ...,"I liked this product for many reasons. It didn't feel greasy like a lot of the other sunblocks. The smell was nice and not the same as the usual suntan lotion smell. It did its job, as my face usually gets sun or wind-burned from my job and it didn't this week. I'd definitely buy this product again and would also recommend it to my friends."
5,I had a chance to give the Coppertone ...,"I had a chance to give the Coppertone All Day Sunblock Lotion, SPF 45 a good Test Drive. My son went on a scout campout in the snow and needed protection from the sunburn one can get from light reflecting off snow. He used it on his face and came back with no burn at all; in fact his skin was smooth and soft too. I couldn't even tell he'd been out in the elements for two days. I was also pleased that it didn't cause his skin to break out, because he's at the age where some products do that. We'll definitely continue to use this product by our pool this summer."
4,The product seemed to work well. The scent ...,"The product seemed to work well. The scent was fine. I like to use sunblock most of the time, so I like one that's long lasting. This is a good product that I'd recommend to someone who is looking for an all-day sunblock."
4,Good school,This product snapped together as the directions indicated. It was quick to assemble and adds to our train yarn. Recommended.
3,Wrong Language,"This is the only performance I've ever heard by Europa Galante that I didn't much like, and the first time I've ever objected to Fabio Biondi's ""operatic"" affect. All the flamboyant turns and attention to musical ""surface"", which make Biondi's performances of Italian music so convincing, here seem to get in the way of Bach's deep contrapuntal integration. I especially dislike the two concerti assigned to the oboe, which is odd because Bach made spectacular use of the oboe in many of his best cantatas. One previous reviewer who like the oboe pieces said essentially that it made the melodic line more distinct; perhaps that's what I DON'T like. In Bach, all lines are melodic lines.But after all, this is Bach! Played by very skilled artists! So I can't give the disk less than three stars. I will, nevertheless, resell it."
5,Worked like a champ,Used this to tap out some rusted frame nuts to install a trailer hitch on a Nissan Murano. Saved me so much time.
5,Excellent Bass lessons here,"I am a self taught Bass player. A friend of mine recommended Ed Friedland as a teacher, so I thought I would investigate one of his many books. This is a concise book that beginners and intermediate players will use and enjoy. It is clearly written with easy to use examples that get the point of the lesson across. The CD is really excellent as it demonstrates the lessons and you can play along as well."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this book. I'm just starting to play bass guitar, and this seemed like just the thing. However, I'm not sure they are able to decide who their audience is supposed to be. The book starts with a very basic introduction to music (the basic scale, notes, etc) ... then jumps straight into the bass lines. It's like moving from the 1-level course to a 4-level course in a couple of pages. Couple that with the music, which is represented only in conventional notation, with no tabs. Yes, I know, I can figure out the tabs from the sheet music. However, how much would it have taken for the author to do this?? Well, one day, I'm sure I'll be good enough to actually use it. Right now, just too painful."
4,Fantastic reference for building walking bass lines,"This book is exactly what I was looking for. It gives the reader the bare essentials with no extraneous material to guide the reader step by step to building musical, flowing bass lines. I highly recommend it."
1,Flashpoint Season 2 - less than half the story!,"This will teach me to read the reviews. This is marked Flashpoint Season 2 on the front, and on the back of the box says, ""contains all 9 episodes from season 2"". The problem is, there were actually 22 episodes in season 2. Thanks a lot, Paramount <sarcasm switch on please> for that truth in advertising. Also, it would be nice if Amazon would label this appropriately as ONLY 9 of 22 episodes from season 2 - it might keep others from making the same mistake I made."
5,Best of both worlds!,"Being brought up in Britain, and my husband in America, we have argued about what side of the pond does it better. This series brings the best of both - fabulous acting, realistic storylines, with great emotional impact.In reply to all the comments stating ""there are only 9 of the 22 episodes"" - I have all of the seasons on DVD and the ""missing"" episodes are on the first discs of the Season 3 DVD. And trust me, if you buy one DVD, you will want them all..."
5,Love this show.,Great keep you on the edge of your seat tv series. My daughter and I are addicted to this show cannot wait for the next episode.
5,Exciting and fun show!,This is an exciting and fun show. Not all the episodes aired in the United States so it was fun to see the ones that only aired in Canada. I have both seasons of the show and cannot wait for the 3rd season to be released.
5,Greatest Show on TV,"This show should be on permanently, not as a summer fill. The show is so realistic, from the standpoint of their job and how it intertwines with their homelife.The actors are great. This show desevers a 10 star rating."
2,Flashpoint Season 2,I am a huge fan of the Flashpoint series and am very disappointed with theFlashpoint: The Second Seasondvd set. Like other reviews posted this set only contains nine of eighteen episodes this is very frustrating because it leaves out half the season.
3,"This is only 9 episodes...The title, Flashpoint: The Second Season, is very misleading","As someone who buys DVD series to collect, not to watch immediately, I was very disappointed to realize that this is only 9 episodes of the series. For those of you interested, here is a list of the episodes included:Business As UsualThe FortressClean HandsAisle 13The Perfect FamilyRemote ControlPerfect StormLast DanceExit WoundsI have to assume that the ""Season Three"" now available for pre-order contains the remaining 9 episodes that should be Season Two Volume Two."
1,Incomplete as Second Season - 13 episodes missing,"This DVD set was advertised as ""Flashpoint - The Second Season"". However, it only contains nine of the twenty-two episodes of the second season. [...]Flashpoint is a superb series, and on my ""can't miss"" watch list. Its strong points are its superbly written scripts and the execution thereof. Hugh Dillon in particular renders a strong performance episode after episode.It is just disappointing that the packaging is so blatently misleading."
3,Go With The CTV Release!,"I spend a lot of time in Toronto where the show is filmed and since ""Flashpoint"" is a Canadian based show I have chosen to buy the Canadian version released by CTV. Here you will get the ""Complete"" seasons as they were meant to be!"
3,Caveat Emptor,"The show is excellently done. My gripe, and hence the title of the review, is that this is NOT the full Season 2 of Flashpoint. Of the 13 episodes produced and shown on CBS in the US, only nine are included in this set. The first four episodes, which are important to the story line development, are NOT included."
2,Incomplete,"This season that pulls up listed as complete 2nd sesason, is an incomplete season. It is missing half of the season.I was extremely disappointed. I have to find another website to find the true actual COMPLETE season and purchase it. So basically I wasted my money."
4,great for preschoolers,"The outdoor adventure kit worked great to keep my 3 year old son occupied while his older brother and I worked with the telescope. He now has his ""gear"" and lets his brother work in semi-peace."
3,for a man,"I like it a lot but, its for a man's wrist not a woman's. It took over 15 minutes to get the hook over one of the links so that I could wear it. I would not buy it again."
1,Edition,"I entered the 8th edition when I was searching for the product. This result popped up with all the matched information about the book I needed, but upon receiving I wasnt able to use the book - wrong edition. I was sadly mistaken as the result didnt show edition number."
4,Excellent drumming but NOT Gene Hoglan,"The double bass in this album is INCREDIBLE, however the drummer is NOT Gene Hoglan as stated in the previous review. It is Jack Schwartz on drums. Jack Schwartz also played drums and toured with Holy Terror."
4,Recommended,"This CD is a good piece of thrash metal music and I recommend it for fans of the genre. All of the tracks are good and some definite highlights are 'Welcome to the Slaughterhouse', 'Hell's on its knees' and 'No Tommorow'."
5,Dark Angel were the greatest death metal band ever !!!!!,"This album was good,but not as good as DARKNESS DECENDS. Gene Hoglan is GOD !!!!! If you like alot of double bass and screaming solos along with intense lyrics get it !!!!!!"
2,Just Not My Favorite...,"DARK ANGEL... Just one of those bands that I've never cared for. Why not? I'm not too sure... They are pioneers within the Thrash genre, they are fast and their guitar work is ok... They're just one of those bands (and we all have them) that while everyone else seems to like, I never have. I feel this release is their best (much better than ""Darkness Descends""), but just not one of my favorite thrash bands. I give them tons of credit, but don't dig on their sound much. DEATH ANGEL is much better!"
5,What a useful dish!,"I ordered this too late for this past Christmas season, but I can't wait to put it to use this year! This addition to my Christmas Tree Spode collecion is large enough to accommodate any recipe I would want use it for. The shape is just so pleasing to the eye and easy to maneuver that I look forward to using it for many years to come. The price was right, too, which is always a bonus, especially around the holidays."
4,"Great actors and a good, underdog plot","Faye Dunaway plays Lena, a female Oklahoma wildcatter during the Great Depression. Along with a maginally helpful, drunkard of a hired man (The only help she can afford), and her not-much-help father, she struggles against prejudice, being flat broke, sabatoge, and a deadly villan in her attempt to bring in a producing well. No ERA, Equal Opportunity Employment, or feminista BS here. Lena doesn't need them. This woman has the competitive guts, courage, and determination any man would be proud to exhibit.Saw this film when released in the early 70s. Sure wish they'd bring it out on DVD."
5,"Great movie, good packaging and excellent video & audio quality","There are some that resist this type of media (on-demand DVD burn), but I have to tell you they are professionally recorded and use the same master and quality of reproduction equipment as prepackaged retail products. These DVD's are authorized by the content owner and they supply the master.I love this film and was so pleased to see it made available. The video and audio quality is excellent and the DVD packaging is as good as most single DVD retail product. This is not the burn-on-my-DVD-player quality you may have purchased before from 3rd parties.If you love this film, buy it . . . you will be very pleased. My guess is that you'll see the on-demand DVD burn delivery method used more and more for this type of older film with a smaller following."
1,Review,"Pretty good but is too technical. It is an example of a ""techie"" trying to write about a program."
3,frustratingly unsystematic,"It's the best book I know of on the subject, but that's only because there's not much else. It offers some interesting, random insights, but it's poorly organized and leaves out so much necessary to an understanding of queen rearing. Read it for the haphazard bits of knowledge, but don't expect to draw any cohesive understanding of queen rearing from it."
2,AARGH!,"This is an ok book for a VERY general overview of queen rearing but if you really want to do it for yourself, do not count on this book. There is little of real use in that regard. Stick with the other books on the subject I'd say..."
2,much ado about....?,"I'm an experienced beekeeper thinking quite seriously about raising queens this coming spring. I find much of the literature in the world of beekeeping to be quite chatty and rarely to the point. While this book brings up many interesting concepts, the focus of the book meanders.I get the idea of how queens grow.What I'm looking for, and didn't find in this book, is a step-by-step 'recipe' of the process of inducing The Ladies to produce queens.My search continues."
2,How to Set Up a Craigslist without the Internet,"The book was published in 1998, about a project that was established in the early 70s. It describes in detail how to set up a way for community members to find each other based on learning and recreational interests, requiring volunteers, index cards, card files, office space, and telephones. The title of the book is appealing, but the content -- the NEED for the content -- is obsolete. I'd love to see the book re-written with web tools in mind."
5,Well worth purchasing,"The author relates fascinating stories about the life of the jungle. The book is grounded in recent research by biological, sociological, and anthropological scientists. Numerous myths are exposed. I personally found the chapter on ancient cities in the jungle of greatest interest."
4,More than for just a coffee table!,"I watched the PBS program on television and bought this book for my environmental scientist fiance. We both love this book and find it very interesting to flip through. The pictures are marvelous and the content is an easy, yet very informative read."
1,lack of information,"i was looking in the manual for directions about how to change belts on my a/c,water pump, etc, and it doesn't say anything about something so simple like that.."
3,My Impressions,This does not cover the common All Wheel Drive vehicles. This turned out to be a disappointment as that was where I had questions. Other than that the manual seems O.K. I am surprised they did not have an extra section for the AWD as all the other information is common between the different vehicles.
5,VERY HIGH QUALITY RENDITION,"All the performances on this set of the Beethoven String Quartets are of the highest quality. Particularly outstanding is the performance of Op 59 no 1Intonation, expression, the ability of the players to meld together, and the dynamic range is all superb.One small flaw (nothing to do with the playing)In the very last track, the final movement of the B flat quartet (not the great fuge, but the movement Beethoven replaced it with), there is a continual flapping sound - I don't know where it came from, but it is very irritating, and I'm surprised that EMI let it through."
1,LOTS OF SKIPS & DISTORTIONS,"Purchased this boxed set through Amazon a short while back. The technical quality is terrible. Skips and distortions all over the discs. At first I thought it might be my equipment, but all other discs play fine -- the problem is restricted to these 7 discs. Poor manufacturing quality."
5,amazon service,"This is a fantastic recording at a very good price. It is a pity the original delivery went astray and I had to wait weeks for the second shipment. However, it was worth the wait. What I found disappointing was getting all these computer generated messages about the possible whereabouts of the shipment, which were unfailingly unhelpful. Now that everything is resolved and I have played the quartets, I am a happy camper and will use amazon.again"
4,Great Sound and early quartets,The Berg Beethoven is big and juicy and this suits the early quartets. Their sound and the recorded sound are certainly the best you will hear. The later quartets miss the introspection of some of the other great string quartets.A great bargain and tops in sound!!!
3,Great Performance - Half Price - But Not Complete,"Very nice performances of the early and middle quartets, but the late quartets are missing from the set. This is an annoying bit of false advertising.There are seven disks in this incomplete set of of the complete quartets. You will need to buy four more if you want the Berg Quartet playing all Beethoven Quartets."
3,The Fifth Version,"Without shame I must confess I have eight versions of this CD, Different interpreters, Some Good, Some better but this particular CD somehow has captured my ear. you don't need to go to extreemes like I do, because I enjoy doin it so, but just give this VERSION a shot and judge for your self."
3,Good but not great,"I guess I'm just used to Haydn and Mozart, because these string quartets were just too dissonant and untraditional for me - one who loves the Beethoven symphonies. To each his own, as they say. The recording itself is terrific - great engineering."
4,Excellent book for parents w/unruly children,"This was one of the most thoroughly researched book on children with discipline problems who do not respond to the usual consequences of their behavior. Dr. Samenow has extensive experience with criminal behavior and insight into the thought processes of deviant children. I was very disappointed, however, with the lack suggestions for parents with these children. The efficacy of counseling is implied without advice on how to find a professional with experience in these areas. How to deal with specific, common behavior problems is not addressed."
2,"Good information, no real solutions","Dr. Samenow does a great job of describing the antisocial child, but does not really tell the parent much about how to solve the problems of the antisocial child. There are lot of really good, very accurate examples and stories shared here. For the reader who does not live with one of these children or who needs reassurance that he is not the cause of the behaviors, this is a good read. For the parent who is employing consistant rules, behavior modifications, therapy, a loving environment and is still seeing an antisocial child, this book was not much help. So, the search for answers continues...."
5,book comments,It was just what I needed. I realized i was not crazy or making things up. I finally understood what I had done wrong and what I need to do to fix it.
3,The Antisocial Youth,"I have been a teacher most of my life. Not all students come to you in a mannerly fashion and ready to work. This book compares the traits of the average child to those of an antisocial youth. There definitely seems to be an early behavior pattern to that of the antisocial child.This is a good book for those in education, law enforcement, and especially parents trying to understand why their child may act the way he does. It is stressed that environment may enter into why a child is the way he/she is, but that untimately choice to behave this way belongs to the youth himself.I am only halfway through the book so a few surprises may still be in the last pages.MAC"
4,good cam,"the webcam is pretty easy to use. i downloaded the drivers from the logitech website instead of the CD given the issues with the product. the image is clear... just don't use the low-light help... it ghosts the images. the sound is ok if you sit in front of the mic... apparently if I move too far to the left or right it will cut out but then again you are using it on your computer so i suppose this isn't an issue. face tracking is good once you get use to it... but i have it turned off because it doesn't always do a great job. there is an issue of unplugging the thing... it does not show up on my usb eject utility so i am not sure what to do with it other than to just wait until i shut off my lapop, i have been searching and apparently others dont have this issue. well overall no major problems... just a few issues that could be slightly annoying. im using it on a t61p IBM laptop. fits very well!"
3,Difficult to use on laptop for Skype,"I purchased this to use with my relatively new Dell laptop for Skype. When I use it, there is this background noise that keeps coming up that disables the microphone. I think it comes from the hum of the laptop itself. I've tried using the noise cancellation feature, and even removed the Quickcam away from the laptop, which seems to help a little but even still, the noise comes back occasionally and I have to wait a few minutes before the other party can hear me."
3,You get what you pay for - and apparently i didn't pay for a box.,"We bought 3 of these as gifts and were very disappointed upon their arrival at packaging (or lack there-of): simply a bubble-wrap bag with a camera and a very generic looking software cd inside. no box. no good for a gift.The products themselves seemed to be in working order, but were not without a few minor dings and scratches...after trying out one of the cameras, we quickly realized that we had gotten what we paid for. At $20 each we didn't expect much from this camera, and we weren't disappointed. Compared with my mac book pro's internal camera, this camera had poorer color, lower frame rate, and much lower resolution.bottom line: it's a cheap camera. if you remember that while you're using it you shouldn't be disappointed."
3,great picture quality. the in-built mic is not that great,"I purchased this product from netdirectbargains on amazon.com for half the original price with the vendor claiming it to be new but when it arrived, I felt it was not new but a used one. The installation CD though not an original Logitec CD, I didnt feel any problem during installation!.As for the product, the webcam is good with great picture quality but the mic is not that sensitive as one has to speak louder than normal, So I use a Sony mic.I wanted a webcam with good picture quality and I got it. that's it."
1,disappointment,"I know I paid very little for this item but, since I have a logitech, I was hoping that the quality would live up to its' name.I am so embarrassed by the quality that I will get another skype camera at a higher price"
2,Good... for a slide show.,"I bought this camera when it was on-sale thinking that most webcams were alike. What a disappointment. The camera is extremely blurry and stutters when in low light conditions. During the daylight it works OK, but at night when my room is just lit by two lamps the video turns into a slide show.I previously had a different camera that I donated to my parents so they could video chat with their granddaughter. That other camera worked much better in the same lighting conditions. I tried downloading the latest drivers, adjusting the settings, etc. Either the video is way too dark or it's way too blurry. If you shoot video in non-daylight conditions, I would be weary of this one.On the plus side, the microphone works very well. As good as or better than my standalone USB mic."
3,"Good value, but not the best picture in the world","This camera represents a good value if you are interested in skype or other video conferencing. It will not take very good photos and is blury when there is too much movement. It is compatible with just about everything and includes an integrated mic. I have been using it for several years and only just replaced it with a camera integrated into my monitor. The lens shield is good to give you security nobody is watching and keeps the lens clean.This is a utilitarian camera, not for someone looking for high picture quality.Basic video communication - yesPicture quality - noThe stand works to ballance it on pretty much any monitor."
4,Good for the price,"I just wanted a basic webcam, and that's what I got for the price. The picture is good and adjust to light and dark, but the video is not smooth. It's very jerky. The sound is great though. A friend bought a Logitech 9000 for twice the cost, but his video is much more smooth."
3,Expected More!!,"I did not like too much, it's reasonable well build, but Facetrack Tecnology is just a digital zoom (what means bad quality), Rightlight Tecnology is just an artificial ISO (what means noise). It's good, but I expected more since I used to know Logitech products by quality, buy a cheaper or a better cam, but this one is expensive for what you get."
4,Well Satisfied With QuickCam,I received my Quickcam Stx and I had it hooked up and running in a few min. The brightness was fine. The Audio adjusted very quickly. The only problem I had was I use my earphones and If I unpluged them I did not have any sound in my speakers. I had to download a file for windows XP that solved that problem. I think the STX is a great product. Logitech needs to update there software to solve that problem.
2,"Camera Good, Software Not so Good","I am a computer programmer and am not stupid when it comes to setting up (and even designing) software. The camera (hardware) is great. The software is not only 'klunky' to setup, it is (at least on my computer) not working correctly. I have been trying to resolve this with tech support for over 3 weeks and I cannot get the software to remember it's settings. It wants to setup the sound settings everytime I open the camera software with it's audio tuning wizard. There are several other settings the software can't seem to 'remember'. I don't know if anyone else has the same problem or not.I would buy another camera, not because of the camera, but the software."
4,Works right out the box,"Set-up this camera on 2 computers: laptop XP was much easier than a PC with Vista. The camera itself mounts well and is easily adjusted.A couple of sucessful video calls on the laptop using Windows Live Messenger. I have not tried a call yet with the PC. Purchased at Amazon $42 USD, Jan 2008.Overall this is a good product which helps me stay in touch with my family."
2,"Works, but it is complicated","First off if you are a Mac person don't buy this web cam. This camera works okay, if you like a lot of complication setting it up. I bought this, because I saw that other reviewers said it works with Macs. It does, but you have to download programs and plugins in order to make it work. You are better off getting an Apple supported web cam. Apple has made it so that only firewire web cameras are supported. So you have to download macam in order to connect a USB camera. I am returning it."
4,Decent for the price,"The camera works as advertised, definitely. I'm not sure if this one issue is because of my underpowered computer or the software, but there seems to be a significant delay in the action and getting it on the screen, so I get thrown off by the lack of sync. It's definitely a great camera though. =)"
4,Esta camara es increible,"Compre la camara hace alrededor de un mes y estoy encantado con ella. Trabaja muy bien en ambientes de poca luz. Mi sistema es un Celeron a 533 mhz, con 256 mb Ram y Windows XP Home y la camara hace bien su trabajo. Realmente la recomiendo."
3,Logitech Quickcam Communicate S5500 Webcam,"I like it and it works fine most of the time if you have XP or better. I am having trouble getting it to work some of the time on Yahoo IM. It works great on Skype, but never on MSN IM (don't know why). It tells me it should on all 3 counts, but it doesn't for me. The downloaded toolbar is a nuisance because you can't move it out of the way, only minimize it. Good quality picture, small size, nice webcam. Just wish it would work with all of the places the add said it would. Maybe you will have better luck than me."
3,good,Not a bad way to communicate if your computer doesn't have a camera already. It is easy to use and a good price.
5,"Great for Linux, too","This camera has a good microphone, and outstanding video for a fairly inexpensive webcam. It worked out of the box in Linux (Kubuntu Feisty), both sound and video. Works great with poor light in the room, and it focuses just fine, both close and distant objects."
1,Waste of money,"The software is easy enough to install, and that's the only good thing about it.After a few days of operation the webcam simply froze and would freeze my PC with it. The only way to solve this was to disconnect the USB, which caused the videos I was shooting for business purposes to automatically disappear.I spoke twice to tech support at Logitech who had no idea how to repair this or why it was occurring in the first place. I un-installed and re-installed the software over 3 times, and the webcam still kept freezing.The worst webcam I've ever owned"
4,WEBCAM,THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY. IT IS PERFECT FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON JUST WANTING TO SEE EACH OTHER AND FOR GRANDPARENTS SUCH AS MYSELF TO SEE OUR GRANDCHILDREN.
4,Logitech Quickcam,This product works great! Its just finding the right video communication program that is a little difficult! Thanks!
4,Great gift,"Got two for mothers day- sent one to mom kept the other so she could talk to grand kids. It was a hit. Best gift in years. Picture and sound quility are good, easy to plug and play."
2,workable but not great,"I bought three of these so we can show off our new baby to her grandparents via skype.1. They are quite blurry. It's fine if you're sitting still and talking, but after any kind of motion the picture will be very bad for around a second.2. One grandparent, on Windows XP, managed to install the drivers that came with the CD instead of downloading the most current ones. As a result, she was sending terrible static bursts every few seconds. Upgrading the driver fixed the issue, but it took an hour of painful over-the-phone debugging to discover that this was the problem.3. We often have trouble with the audio cutting out. Probably this is a bandwidth problem, but we all have ""good"" internet service (cable modems or fiber).If I had it to do over again, I would pay some extra to buy something better."
4,Great product for the price,"It works great, sits nicely on our monitor and we are pleased with it. Thanks!"
4,Good... not great,This camera is extremely simple to set up and use. I use it to speak to my brother who lives in Switzerland through Skype. It is real time and works good. You can not make fast movements with your hands such as playing music. It will not pick up the motions. Overall suits the purpose i got it for.
4,Logitech Auickcam Communicate STX,"Advantages: clear picture, very easy to install. Works well with SKYPE.Disadvantage: has to be installed in a USB2. Otherwise jerky movements."
5,Great product!,"This webcam is easy to install, fast and easy to use and is adjustable so it fits on your laptop on any angle you like. I would buy another and recommend it to anyone!"
3,"Good for planning, not so good for transactions","I invested in the mastery system which includes this system.I wish I had read it at my prior company where the emphasis ison financial planning. The values provide the ""why"" and therefore the motivation to complete the plan.I now work in a bank and tried using this with not good effect.Transaction time is much shorter. I'm now revisiting ""Trust Based Selling"" by Kerry Johnson and subliminal selling technqiues that more appropriately fit the banking environment.Bacharach ignores the whole concept of rapport and goes for the close as a way to screen out people. That's great if you have an endless supply of qualified referrals to work from. Also his book assumes people want planning when many times they already have a planner or just want to do a transaction.I'm finding both Tom Hopkins books and Kerry Johnson's a much better fit for what I do and also have bought ""Socratic Selling"" which I believe provides real value to the client."
2,"Good Idea, Could Have Been a Magazine Article","I am a financial planner and am aware that Bacharach's book is often recommended to sales professionals in the financial services industry. I think the basic idea of the book - values-based selling - is one that works and is to be commended to sales people in the business. However, I thought the book never went much beyond the basic idea. To me, it was a ""fluff"" read. The ideas that one needs to take from the book could have been summed in a ten page magazine article, making the book, at $35, not much of a value. I recommend Nick Murray's ""The Excellent Investment Adviser"" and Neil Rachman's ""SPIN Selling"" as more valuable additions to one's bookshelf."
4,Nice razor,This is a nice razor and the blades that come with it are cheaper than the fusion and other modern blades. Provides a clean shave.
5,the best razor by far,I have been buying these since they came out. great handle and amazing blades. This is the BEST RAZOR ever!
4,"Good razor, but not better than my 2-blader.","I upgraded to the Mach 3 from a Wiltech (Wilkinson Sword) two-blade system. The shave is certainly less smooth, but the shaver/blade system feels much safer. I've used it for about two weeks now and have no cuts. The older system used to cut fairly frequently, but gave me a smoother shave. It was way cheaper as well. Overall I prefer the Mach 3 though and will not go back."
1,illegally imported product,"The product I got was not the correct product.1. The product that I received was to be sold only in India. It clearly said Rs. 99/- only. It is illegal - It is shame for such a big seller to be part of an ugly incident.2. The product that I bought clearly said that there would be two cartridges; however, the one I got has only ""One"" attached to the system.Shame on Amazon to let such sellers sell such cheap and illegal stuff.Real shame!!"
2,Not the best...,I find that the Gillette Sensor 3 gives a far superior shave that the Mach3 for no other reason than the head swivels too much. I consider this a waste of money.
2,A Little better than mediocre,"Not much better than a disposable double edge razor.Shick Quattro works much better for me & also allows against the grain shaving. I'm 56 years od with a medium beard that grows staight.2-16-2012: After one blade, now the subsequent blade shaves much better. I seem to remember the last time I switched brands my beard had to ""adjust"".I still like Quattro better & am switching back as soon as these are used-up."
2,claim is misleading,"It says that it has 1 razor and two cartridges. Actually it has one handle and two cartridges. I don't consider the handle without a cartridge a razor. I expected to get a total of three cartridges, one in the ""razor"" and two others. I didn't get that."
5,Solid razor,I've been using the Mach 3 since it came out when I was in college sometime in the early 90's. I don't need anything fancy and only have to shave every couple days or so. Gillette keeps adding things like batteries and more blades but who needs it? Keep it simple and do the job. This is a plus on both.
3,Fair product.,"This provides a fairly smooth shave, but it doesn't do as well as some disposables I've used. C- for blade life as well."
3,Decent,"I think the gillete fusion proglide is better than this, but for the price it's decent. I thought this was going to come with 2 extra razors, but it did not. Weird."
4,Rotation Must!!,"An excellent, concise review of many outpatient diagnoses encountered by the medical professional during rotations. A must for residents, PA's or nurse practitioners."
5,A Hidden Gem,"This book is brimming over with useful nuggets on how to deal with reporters. Stauffer shows how the real world of small and mid-sized media markets operate on a daily basis. Most of his insights are still hihgly relevant taoday, nearly a decade after he wrote the book."
1,Vanity Book,"If you are looking for an instruction guide on how to manage reporters ... you are going to be as disappointed as I was when this book arrived in the mail. The essential message from the author, who tells you he is a reporter on the cover of his book, is primarily that we should talk to reporters. He gives very little real insight on how to deal with aggressive reporters who will do anything to get an ""angle"" on a story. I wish I hadn't purchased it."
4,great for hand eye coordination plus fun,"This is a great way for adults and kids to play together - and for kids to play by themselves. How many toys can say they can do both? I like the design , compact but durable. My nephew, for whom I bought this for his birthday, was excited to have a dart board just like the one in the office of a grownup he admires. This one doesn't require hardware to install and it won't wreck your walls or furniture. And you don't have to worry about poking someone's eye out! Darts are great for building hand-eye coordination, for practicing math, and for just plain having fun! Plus, after the kids go to bed, the grown ups can play, too! Break out the beer and pretzels and it's just like being at the corner pub but your spouse won't complain!"
1,Not exactly as advertised,"Earlier review of this item is wrong. This is not the first three DVD's of the series. This is the Limited Edition Collector's Box II with only Volume 7 (finale). I ordered this item based on description in earlier review as Amazon provided no information on what this item really is, or how many discs come with it. So please, only buy this item if you need Volume 7 and you want the Collector's Box. This box will fit Volumes 4-7 of the series. I hope this stops anyone from making the same mistake I did, as I double purchased Volume 7."
2,not a good story line,weird movie. not very compelling and not a good version of this show. a b c d e f g
1,Save your money,These disks have no track numbers or tracking times and there is no booklet included.
2,"terrible, awful, hideous, lousy","The problem with the ""classics"" is that too many hacks have hacked them to pieces. My opinion of these recordings, for whatever it is worth, is that they simply do not do justice to Strauss's magnificent music.There is a reason they are a ""bargain"". I would avoid this set.Sometimes a boxed set is a good deal, but this one is not. I find the entire set unspeakably dull and literally unlistenable.In any event, this is merely my opinion. The majority of the other reviewers think its terrific."
4,Trophies,I really enjoyed this book... there were a lot of places that they went and I learned alot about the horse world of showing. Very intertaining.
5,Awaiting the movie version !,"This is a fabulously rich read ! I'm waiting for the movie version to be realeased , or at least a six week mini series on TV ! You don't need to be an equestrian to enjoy this very well written story , full of fasinating characters !"
3,"""Original"" price is inaccurate","20 ml Rescue Remedy has NEVER been $37+! The highest price I've ever seen was less than $20. Actually, the ""discount"" price listed here IS the highest price I've ever seen for it. And for the people who think the alcohol content is what is calming, please note that at 27% brandy content and recommended dosage of 2 to 4 drops, that is either a very small drop (or at worst a small drop!) of alcohol....not enough to have any effect by itself."
2,No effect on cat,"Our hyper sensitive vocal (OCD) 7 year old cat (adopted from the pound) is completely unaffected by repeated doses of this Bach remedy. Perhaps it works for others but not our cat which by the way is a tiny little thing too weighing about 6 lbs. We experimented and applied it directly into the mouth and started with small frequent doses and then larger and larger doses and amounts and saw absolutely no difference in our cat's annoying hyper behavior. Yes, she has regular health checks etc."
1,Generic about any business book,"If you are looking for a book on how to do a housecleaning business, don't look here. This book is a cookie cutter version of just about 30 or so other books purportedly on how to Start and Manage a ******* (place your own title) business. If you are looking for any particulars, dont look here."
4,gillette tried then in vietnam,in vietnam we got a box of these and they worked like a charm...my dad even said that they were excellent. you don't know you weren't there
2,Not the best I have ever purchased,Blades don't seem to last as long as those purchased from local store. I can only get one to two shaves out of a blade. I am use to getting at least three shaves.
1,Dull Blades!!!!,"Very dull blades!!! I don't know if these were fake, but they definately were dull. If I had bought these in the store I would have returned them!! I guess I'll suck it up and deal with it."
3,"Became too expensive, even with subscription","These increased over 8 dollars during my Amazon subscription. May as well buy them at Target. The blades work well, though I think they're decreasing in quality over the years since they used to last 10 days each, now only 5-6. Probably we're selling less due to the higher quality, so they knocked them down so you'd need to replenish more frequently. Makes sense."
4,"Not the best blades, but not bad either.","I usually buy the Mach 3 Turbo blades but these were a much better buy so I got them thinking there wouldn't be a big difference. The blades probably last half the time that the Turbo blades do and aren't as smooth of a shave. I shave about every day and one blade is beyound using after about a week to a week and a half. This is about half as long as I can get the Turbo to go. If I was to judge these blades on there own I think I would give them 5 stars, but compaired to the Mach 3 Turbo blades, they just aren't as good."
2,Blades That Didn't Pass Q/A,"I read a negative review complaining about the quality of the blades. This review was for the same product, just the smaller amount of cartridges. I decided to go with the larger amount because the reviews seemed to be better and more consistent. As soon as I used the blades for the first time, I knew what the negative person was talking about. I have been buying Gillette Mach 3 blades for years from my local grocery store. These blades are not as sharp and do not last as long as the ones I get from my local store. I have a strange suspicion that these blades are not of the same quality as the ones from your local stores. Either these blades are the ones that didn't pass Q/A or they are made from a cheaper metal; I'm not sure, but I'm writing Gillette to find out."
1,It really is like shaving with sandpaper,"I had the same experience as the previous reviewers: I received fake blades. It felt like my hair was being pulled out rather than cut. And the ""lubricating strip"" was just a piece of plastic. The blades I bought were sold by Reflections. I would recommend to only buy these blades if they are sold by Amazon."
1,Knock Off Blades,These blades must be knock-offs as they are the wrong color (black instead of gray) and don't last as long as the over the counter models I have used for years. These last 5-6 shaves before dragging and pulling while the originals last 10 or so. Amazon needs to check to see if these are the real deal.
1,blades not sharpened,I was very disappointed in this product because the blades I received had not been sharpened. I complained to the vendor but got no response. When I complained to Amazon they responded very quickly and refunded my money. Thank you Amazon!
1,Chinese Junk!,This is the not the first time I've ordered Mach3 from Amazon but what I received was a first for me. Nonaligned razors that fell to pieces after the second shave. When you first get your package all goes well. Check out your razor after your second shave. PURE JUNK! I will happily return this crap to Amazon with one resounding question. Why????
3,Dull,"I'm not convinced that these are the real Mach 3 razors. They seem dull compared to the ones we get at Walmart. Good pricepoint here, but doubt I will re-order."
4,Great buy!!,If you like mach 3 well then this is the cheapest place to get them. Amazon price is less then wholesale story and saves you a trip out to the store
4,Great blades,Not sure what's up with all the reviews of this being a fake product. The blades I received are the great ones that I usually get in stores.Have been using the Mack3 for more than seven years now. These are the still the best and most reliable blades that I have ever used.
