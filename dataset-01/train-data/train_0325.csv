5,"dont you want it, dont you want it, dont you want it","without a doubt one of the greatest films ever made. so what if the movie wasn't 100% accurate to the book, it's still great. tim curry is awesome and should have got an oscar or at least a nomination. best line "" you all taste so much better when you're afraid."" the first half of the movie far exceeds and overshadows the second half but thats because the children did a better job of expressing their fear. the nicely designed sets, creepy music and special effects all form to deliver a horror experience like none other. anyone who tells you they weren't scared by this movie is full of..."
3,Not scary enough!,"I read the book ""It"" before I saw the movie. The book scared the .. out of me, but the movie just...didn't. There are a few scary parts when Pennywise shows his long and pointy teeth, but generally, he was too funny to frighten me all that much. Plus, the spider at the end was so stupid. I suppose maybe this movie would have been better if it hadn't been made for TV."
5,Now I Know Why Im Scared Of Clowns,I first saw this movie a year ago and it terrified me. I've been scared of clowns all my life and now I know why. I saw the comercials and posters for this when I was little and clowns have scared me ever since.The end wasnt that great because of the cheesey spider but other than that it was great. Tim Currey did a good job as Pennywise the clown. All the other acters in the movie did pretty well to.
3,"""Down here, they all float!""","I was anticipating a pretty good flick, as it is probably the most famous of the Stephen King book-into-movie productions, next to ""The Shining"", but I was disapointed with it. (FYI: I'm not some moron who's going to say the special effects were bad, I don't judge based on stuff that wasn't invented yet.) The acting itself was pretty good, and Tim Curry plays a good It, but some of scenes seemed cheezy after reading the book.As with most King movies, the better scenes from the book aren't included, which is a shame because these are what King is most famous for.I think I would recommend this if you are a die-hard Stephen King fan, or if you have never read a one, and you appreciate a nice ol' horror flick."
4,Don't Watch It If You're Afraid Of Clowns,"This was a very good drama/epic/horror thiller. A group of kids are terrorized by a menacing, crazy, killer clown that unexpectedly appears to them individually to scare them and threaten them. Supposedly, it's a vengeful spirit of a man who worked as a circus clown and was killed. The clown is kind of funny, but is really evil. The kids finally get fed up with it and track it down and assume they have killed it in an underground water facility. But it comes back when they are adults and begins it's tactics again on each person. But now it's stronger and much more deadly than before. So they leave their busy lives behind as they return to their childhood Maine town to reunite and confront IT once again."
1,"""IT"" was ruined by omiting the best scenes!","i was shocked by the first omission of the beginning scene where the little girl was attacked and killed by Pennywise, the clown from hell, AKA ""IT"". we also missed the scene about Georgy and his relationship with his older brother. we also missed where Georgy was sending his paper boat down stream in the gutter where we should have been introduced to that horrible clown and his terrifying pointed teeth, who was in the gutter, waiting to consume small children. a lot of the show was rendered impotent and embarrassingly silly because there was nothing leading up to the so-called scary scenes to add to the tension and making them really scary. Pennywise was still really creepy. i wish i could have seen the scenes that were cut from the original TV movie. i would never have ordered it, had i known it was incomplete. at least, now you are warned!"
2,Movie doesn't come close,"I was in the Halloween spirit and read the book ""It"" and definitely wanted to see it come to life in the movie. The book was great. I watched the movie and it doesn't compare to the book. I thought it would be a full length movie but I later found out that it was a made for TV series. The movie wasn't scary at all. I wasn't looking for another Saw movie but I was looking forward to some terrifying action and it never happened.My recommendation would be, just read the book. It makes more sense than the movie and it is 100 times scarier."
1,Terrible!,"What a terrible adaption of a great book! Even one star is overrated. I was so disappointed. It's not even the actors, it's the way the movie is shortened. I even researched online if i got a faulty dvd, because it just stops so suddenly and leaves the whole end of the book off. It is horror, indeed!"
5,One of the scariest films of all time.,"I first saw this movie when I was about ten years old,and it scared the hell out of me.Clowns have always been creepy.But,when they try to lure little kids into sewers to eat them,that is some pretty terrifying stuff.The acting in this movie is top notch.Both the young actors and the all-star adult cast,that includes actors such as Richard Thomas and the late John Ritter.I've never read the novel before,but I can promise you one thing....this movie will scare the hell out of you too."
3,Where are the murders?,"This movie was really entertaining, not reall scary because this movie was not much of blood and gore. It was a villan that was scary to me when I was a little kid, and I'm STILL ten years old watching this movie. It's a good movie, gives me the chills sometime, and luckily no ""naked"" people."
2,Pretty weak..,"I just finished watching this on cable and, wow, was it mediocre. I made the same mistake another reviewer made and read the book first. While long, the book goes into much more detail which made for a far better story. Although it's tough to bring a long book to the screen, the movie was very corny, especially the ending. Again, wow! What was that?! I can't say that it was terrible and parts were kinda fun to watch but I definitely would not recommend someone actually buying this. Watch it on cable if it's on but save your money for the far better scary movies available.."
2,Urggggggggggggg,"This film really bothers me. I read the book, loved it, and got pumped up for seeing the film. Unfortunately, it was painful to watch. It is nowhere near as good as I would have hoped. They rushed over everything, way to faast, and missed a lot of the point. There was stuff in there that simply did not make sense if you haven't read the book.On top of that, they missed a lot of the point. A large portion of the book was about battling your mind. In the book, the silver bullet works, because they are using it on what their mind made look like a werewolf, and because they believed it would hurt him, it did! The same thing with Eddies aspirator, but the film did not bother to lay these things out.Summed up, Grrrrrrrrrrrrr. Read the book a second time, or even a third. The film is poor!!"
2,Book Reader Outraged,"I saw this movie as an eight year old many years ago and I was terrified for too long too remember. Now, years later, I just finishing reading the book, (The book was amazing, I highly recommend it!) and decided to see the movie afterwards. I was horrified-but not in the way I was expecting!The movie was boring with bad special effects and no regard for what actually happened in the book. I could list obvious errors for each scene, not just things which a Made-for-TV-movie couldn't include, but cases where things go against what is stated in the novel. The characters (mainly Richie, who was always my favorite) do not act the correct way. Henry and his gang are greatly pacified as well as Bev's father and even It. It, the creature, suddenly has new rules for what it can do and what can hurt it. The movie was a horrible disappointment with no knowledge of the novel Stephan King wonderfully wrote."
3,(+ 1/2) it was ok,"i'm a little disappointed by this movie: all of my friends said they are scared to take showers since they watched it. i mean, this movie had its good points: it was scary (at times) and i found it somewhat interesting. but 3 hours and 7 minutes? come on!!! how can anyone stay focused for that long? also this movie wasn't all that scary. at the beginning it was, but i wish they would have left a little more to the imagination. if you want a SCARY movie and you don't have a huge phobia of clowns, don't watch this movie. if you do and want to see it, go ahead. you'll be interested in it for the first hour or so. if you don't, then you shouldn't waste your time. i've heard that the book is better. maybe you should read that instead. hope i helped! (:"
1,"Wow, this movie really sucks!","This movie just plain blows. How can it have a 4 star average rating?? The book is great- I love Steven King, and a lot of movies based on his books are good, but this one is a joke. The acting is the worst part of the movie, it's so bad that's it's almost good. One very annoying thing they try to do is use as many tiny little details from the book, or use the exact same phrases that the characters in the book used. Sometimes that's cool, like in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but it really doesn't work here. Don't waste your time watching it and definantly don't waste your money buying it!"
1,Why does everyone pick on the ending?,"Look obviously most of you have not read the book. The ending in the movie is the same as the ending in the book. They face a giant spider who is capable of shape shifting. And for those of you who think this movie is good, GET REAL! If you want intense characterization, READ THE BOOK! This TV-movie DOES NOT do this movie justice. You get better insights to all the characters in the book. There are things in the book that are not even mentioned in the movie that will scare the socks of you. For scare quality, the book scares you more than this movie. The movie is comical. Tim Curry was the only thing worthwhile in it. It did have a good cast, but you do not get the deep insights to the characters that the book gives you. So people, please read the book. You'll see why this movie is AWFUL! A note to Stephen King: Please stop allowing your books to be made into movies, unless they do it page by page and are at least 10 hours long!"
4,Finally I found it.,"This is one of the hardest movies to find, either on DVD or VHS. It's not played on TV as often as every other Stephen King mini series. Bought it for my son as a stocking stuffer. Yeah, I know what your thinking. He read the book first and I was happy to watch it with him. The seller was honest regarding the condition of the product, it was good and the DVD was not damaged in any way. Thanks"
3,Not too bad for a TV movie,"IT makes for a good viewing, but probably just once or twice. It's good but read the novel if you want to be really scared. The movie has some excellent frightening moments (it could have been theatrical by today's standards) but it leaves you missing something. Check out the book first if you're a King fan."
4,A pretty good movie,"I first saw this movie on ABC in the fall of 1990. Though it was scary, it was rather tame compared to the book (which I *did* read and is more gruesome than the movie). The acting was very good from both the adult actors (huge thumbs-up for Tim Curry as Pennywise/IT) and child actors (especially Ben Heller as young Stanley). I can understand why some Stephen King fans might be upset to see his book ""butchered"" or altered or whatever, but it's a 1000+ page book. The producers and writers took artistic license, and did a good job.This is a great movie to watch on a weekend night, or a rainy afternoon. I really recommend it."
3,IT,"Well if you are afraid of clowns then dont watch this... I hate clowns and it made me cry when i was like, 8... Hell, I'd still probably cry if i saw it now.... If theres anything as scary as it, its ronald mcdonald...The films got a good storyline like, but if it wasnt for the clown I'd give it 5 stars..."
5,An 11 year old who saw it,This movie is far the best but it was still very scary it was all good except for the part that he`s an alien spider thingy it would be better if it was just a physco clown
3,"Great Book, Acceptable Movie","Firts of all, let me say that I've not yet finished the book, I'm on page 600 and advancing, but I've seen the movie a couple times.Ok, that's real, It's sometimes not a good mirror of the book, however I think it is quite good, I'm 18, and I saw it for the first time when I was 15, and every time I went to my room, I've to run for the light before feeling the clown's presence, I mean, I was scared to hell with it.Tim Curry is great as Pennywise, I discovered it was him jus a few minutes ago, because I had never seen the movie credits before, and now I admire him a lot more than before.I've already ordered this item, and I recomend both, movie and book. If you really liked the movie, read the book, if you really liked the book, think it twice but see the movie."
1,Junk,This is another movie based on King's books that really stinks. It is a total joke compared to the book. Don't waste your time on this garbage.
1,IT-THE MOVIE,"I just want to start this off by saying....CHECK MY REVIEW FOR THE BOOKI loved the book, so i had my wife buy me the DVD off of EBAYI couldnt wait to watch it. After watching this movie, i am truly scarred. This has to be one of the most HORRID things that has ever been put on film. How can SK let this be created?Are they kidding me, with this movie? was it supposed to be a joke?My wife said for that we will just sell it on EBAY, i said NO. I could not let another human being go thru this torture!!!So i took the DVD and casing, went out in my backyard, and burned it with lighting fluid!!!!!THIS MOVIE IS BRAIN POLLUTIONGO READ THE BOOK....THE BOOK WAS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER READ!"
3,It,"I only watched one side because I didn't realize it was two sided. The Side I watched was when they are older. It was ok, but I've heard the other side is much better."
1,Could be the worst movie ever made.,"Why can't I take stars away from this movie? (minus one star) This could be the worst movie ever made. I did not read the book It is based on, so I can't compare the movie with the book. But this movie has everything: wooden acting, absurd dialogue, clumsy direction, cheesy special effects, idiotic plot, silly ending, bad cinematography. The only question is whether it is so bad as to be campy. This may be the only movie ever made that is just bad, bad, bad. I've seen home movies of a kid's birthday party that are more entertaining and suspenseful."
3,One of the better comedies I've seen...,"Was this supposed to be scary, because I laughed during most of the movie.Guessing the book was better because this movie was just plain silly."
1,stephen kings it.,it's as scary as it looks....Very intense.And the clown is just horrifying.I wouldn't let no kids watch this.it scared me.
2,BUY THE BOOK!!,"There are some creepy scenes and the child actors do a good job acting. I also find Tim Curry's acting enjoyable. Besdies that,it also has too many plotholes,flashbacks,stereotypes & cliches done to death by Stephen King. Tim's overacting is so unbearable. Even Angus Macfadyen acting as Komodo in Warriors of Virtue wasn't that over-the-top. The stop-motion is poorly done. Some of the cast are cruel to each other for no good reason. The balloons are NOT scary. I seen scarier things on MAD the animated series. Overall,this movie stinks. I give IT a 2 out of 10."
5,Awesome! can some one help me find Part 11 to this movie.I love it!,"This movie is past being good,its Awesome!the freindship the bond and the comitment between the freinds is just Super! can some one help me find part 11 to this movie,I have to fiind it.dobrown76@ymail.om"
1,what the hell happened?,"this is the worst stephen king movie ever! the book is my favorite out of all books and i've read it a thousand times, maybe that was why i was so disappointed in this movie. when i first saw this movie on tv i was horrified, tim curry was the perfect choice for the clown, and the first part (with the children) was ok, but the directors left so much out and changed so much, i felt betrayed. i've seen it once more lately to see if my perspective had changed, but i'm still saddened by the lack of respect for the greatest book i've ever read. maybe if it hadn't been a tv movie..."
5,Great Horror Film,"My friend, her cousins, and I watched this movie at her birthday party. We accidentally watched part 2 first, but it was still really scary. I usually don't scream, but I must have screamed 30 times throughout the movie. I haven't read the book, but I loved the movie! Tim Curry does a great job as the ever scary Pennywise the clown. We were so freaked out the rest of the day and the next day. I would recommend this movie to everybody."
5,in the top 5,"this movie was great. i watched it once as a kid and was terrified beyond belief. now i'm 23, and i still cover my eyes on some parts. stephen king has been the master of horror all the way back to the christine days. he really did it this time though. this movie was intended to give you the creeps more than anything else. for instance, the atmosphere of the town was always wet and gloomy. plus, pennywise appears in the weirdest places like the shower room and graveyard scene, which adds to the scares. it is a very unique movie. it's make you develop a phobia of clowns that will stick with you for quite a while. i only wish they could have included tim reid in the final parts of the film (him being one of the main chars and all).one last thing, the gas station scene has to be the creepiest scene i've ever watched in a horror movie."
1,The worst movie that I have EVER SEEN,"I read probably 600 pages of the Stephen King book. The book was good and captivating but after 600 pages, he lost me. It was just way too long. And now, the movie. WOW! It's absolutely.... TERRIBLE!!! This is by far the worse movie that I have EVER seen and I wasted 3 hours of my life on it. It cuts out most of the book just to make it PG and what there is is horrid. The movie is SO BORING and the clown isn't scary at all. Whenever the clown would appear, I would fall over in laughter. The book actually gave me chills and was a freaky and scary book. This movie is anything but scary. I laughed nonstop because it was so terrible. The movie is about a group of people that regroup to kill a crazy clown that they thought that they had already killed. The movie progresses very slowly and is therefore really boring. And the clown is stupid. And not scary. So, if I were you, don't do like I did and save 3hrs of your life!"
1,Dislike Amazon,Not to satisfy I havent recieved my movie I bought twice from this same website and nothing have I been returned.
1,What the hell . . .?,"That was a peice of corn. Seriously! The only good parts were Tim Curry as Pennywise (I LOVE TIM!) and the dog in the jail cell who ""killed"" the guard. One reason why this movie sucked, was because it was produced by Tim Curry's evil chinese impersonator: TIM BLURRY! Yes, Tim Blurry looks exactly like a chinese bum they found off the streets, unleashed maggots on his face and hair, fed on his flesh. Tim Curry is a schizophrenic, and Blurry is the outcome. That is why the movie sucked. DON'T LET BLURRY FOOL YOU! BURN HIM IF HE COMES NEAR! Remember that hairspray makes him stronger, bu nail polish remover takes away his strength. I know cuz my friend is a pyromaniac and we had a little burning ceromoney, where we burned Tim Blurry. TIM CURRY RULES! DON'T FORGET TO SEE CHARLIE'S ANGELS! Which Tim Blurry also co-produced, well only the part when he dies . . . DON'T LET BLURRY FOOL YOU! BURN HIM, BEFORE HE MAKES YOU FLOAT!"
1,THIS MOVIE TOTALLY SUCK,"If you compare the original Stephen King's it with the movie, you'll just find out that the movie isn't nothing but a cheap crap. The book is a masterpiece and I am reading it for the second time right now, no mind the 1039 pages of the book. The movie is a totally crap. The actors suck, the plot suck, the direction suck, everything suck. It's the most rediculous movie I'v ever seen. I hightly recommend to read the book first and then after you've read the book then watch the movie. You'll see what I mean......."
1,horrible...,"Ok, get real. This movie is just as boring as the book. I'm a Stephen King fan, but It was just bad. Even the book couldn't keep my attention. After reading 200+ pages, I realized nothing happened and gave up. That's also how I felt about the movie. After the first four hours, you realize this is boring. And the ending, in the sewer? WOW, it was so bad, that I actually enjoyed it, because I got to laugh."
3,Dissapointing .......if you have read the book,"Now ""IT"" is my favorite novel, and when i heard there was a movie out i was really exciting and as i am watching this i realize there are so many key parts that were in the book that got left out of the movie so if you have read the book you probably won't enjoy this maybe you will but thats just my opinion, now if you haven't read the book and just want to watch a good movie this is for you and the one good thing i really liked was how john ritter(R.I.P) played my favorite character Ben and he played him well. So i believe there to be alot of pros about this movie and tons of cons so watch for yourself and you be the judge"
1,IT SUCKED!!!!!!,A T E R R I B L E H O R R O R M O V I E! I E X P E C T M O R E F R O M S T E P H E N K I N G.
2,IT,"This movie scared me outta my mind when i was young.... Now it just put me to sleep. I read the book (which was also long and boring) then watched the movie. Maybe its poor acting or the poor special effects, either way, i was not impressed. I always saw myself as a Steven King fan, but the more I read of his stuff, im finding that im not. I do love the Shining but thats about it."
3,As Good As It Could Be,"I have never been a big fan of this movie, or the novel. I have never thought a clown could be scary, but in this film it almost happens, almost. The acting in this movie isn't bad. I guess it's about as good as it could be. Overall I think it's pretty mediocre. You'll be okay if you see it, and you'll be okay if you don't. That's about the size of it."
1,Horrible movie based on a great book,"I really did not like this adaptation of Stephen King's wonderful novel. The acting left a lot to be desired and the screenplay strayed so far from the book that I almost wouldn't have recognized the story. I don't even think I would have liked it if I hadn't already read the book. I usually like to read the book that inspired the movie, or watch the movie that was based on the book, so I can get a full experience, but in this case I wish I had left the movie alone."
3,Could be better,"The book written by Stephen King was absolutely fenominal, but the movie can't compare. Not that ""It"" is a bad movie, but there were a few too many important details and a few new things that were added in.Now, about the disk itself, everything was okay untill I had to read other review to find out that the 2nd part of the movie is on the other side of the disk.But, all in all, it was worth the price."
4,"The clown ""IT"" By: Stephen King","The clown ""IT"" is a cereal killer. He comes and goes and no one ever knows where he will pop up next. But every time he does pop up he ends up killing someone or something. When the killing happens the person that dies doesn't really expect ""IT"" coming. When this happens something odd happens to them or part of there property. An example would be losing power to there house in middle of the night. So begins the exciting and scary book. I thing that Stephen king deserves all the rewards that this book has won. Children twelve and up should have a copy of this book for there home library because this book could keep you going for hours if you like scary fun filled books."
1,"I'm Sorry, This movie Sucks!","""It,"" is perhaps Stephen King's greatest novel, riveting, horrifying, and thoroughly entertaining. However, this awful production demonstrates the folly of taking a wonderful story and then destroying it with cheap made-for-TV production values, production, and direction. None of the actors rings true to the characters in the book; the players are all out-of-work hasbeens or neverwases working with an extremely lame script that removes all the mature drama and horror from the plot. The special effects aren't bad, but the clown is a bit silly (like something from a bad '80s MTV video) Love the story, hate this movie to the extreme. A really good Stephen King movie has yet to be made, and this sets a very low standard. File under"" ""yuck!"""
3,HELP!,"Could anyone here tell me the difference between ""IT"" and ""Stephen King's IT"", they looks identical on the post, I don't know which one I 'd watched before. Thanks!"
2,Unsatisfactory,"This wasn't an utter failure, but some of the ""scary"" parts made me laugh. Like the scene with Eddie in the shower, and the clown coming up from the drain. I suppose it would have been scarier had I been alone in the house at night or something... but I had been expecting a lot worse after reading the book, It by Stephen King, which remains my favorite book of all time. Perhaps I was laughing out of desperation for some enjoyment in life after this mediocre performance of the book I love. Not terrible, but not really worth it unless you're truly interested."
5,scary?very!,tim curry was awesome as pennywise and there were alot of jump scenes in the movie to like the begining the girl look into clothes hangers and reveals the clowns face and georgies picture blinks at bill and has creepy clown sounds.so it doesnt compare to the book but i must say its scary as hell!
3,IT Was Okay,I Rented IT A While Ago.It Was Okay.But I Didn't Think Of It As A Scary Movie More Like A Supense-Thriller With A Touch Of Horror.But It Was Still Good For A 3 HR. Movie.
5,This Movie Was Totally Cool,"This movie used to scare me when I was 4 and it still kinda creeps me out mainly in the graveyard in tape #2 but the rest doesn`t at all my favorite line throughout this whole movie was probabily ""We all float down here Georgie and when your down here you`ll float too"" MY NAMES KEVIN UHRICH AND I`M 13 YEARS OLD"
4,"Not bad, but does not do the book justice","The movie is pretty good. It has some pretty good scenes and the actor who plays IT does a good job. Compared to the book, the movie over does the clown. In the movie IT always appears as the clown or changes to the clown soon after. In the book IT appears in about 20 different forms. The actor who plays Bill is terrible. The book is mostly what happens when they are kids, and the movie is the opposite. Please read the book first."
5,this is a must see if you are having a stayover!,"this movie is so cool,BUT PARENTS BEWARE!!!!!IT HAS MILD LANGUAGE BUT A SCENE AT THE END OF VIDEO #1 THAT IS BLOODY AND DISGUSTING!but besides that and the spider[which would have been better if it was a 20 foot tall pennywise,]it was great."
4,It was good,"This film had the classic undercurrent so prevalent in Stephen King movies, but maintains greatness. The special effects were lacking, which is understandable, it being not a very new movie. The book was better than the movie, but then, it always is. I thought that Henry Bowers was sadly underdeveloped though."
4,good for what it was,"This is probably the best book to movie translation out there, however its still not exact, and the book is way too long to make it into a full movie. This movie is also one of the only movies that succesfully makes a clown scary. Most clown horror movies are stupid. Only reasons for not giving it 5 stars: it was too made for tv, and therefore, lacked gore. It was also slow and could have probably been made into a lot shorter of a movie. Some of this is alot of time killing if you ask me."
4,"Made in 1990, lets look at the concept","I think that before you buy this movie, you should understand that it is fairly old, and made for TV, which automatically knocks the rating down.I have seen a fair amount of made-for-TV-movies, but this one is by far the best out of all of them. Not because it has scary special effects, or suspensful moments. It is because of the concept. Imagine for a moment that there really was a clown that could transform itself into your worst nightmares, and what's worse, only you can see it. If you can picture that, then you have found what makes this movie horror. It is not because of gore or suspense, but when you are up at 3 AM, delirious from lack of sleep, and staring around your dark bedroom all alone, you will find that the movie was much scarier then when you were watching IT."
4,IT,"Not on par with The Stand, but still a pretty good movie. It was actually a lot better then I had anticipated. Obviously not as detailed as the book - what movie is - but definitely worth adding to your Stephen King collection!"
3,Poor Adaptation,"The DVD of Stephen King's It is a big disappointment. This is one of the best books that I have ever read and was eagerly awaiting this adaptation. It doesn't portray the unbridled fear that the book does and the acting is average. I give this 3 stars, but the book is easily 5 stars!"
5,The eater of children,"This movie was excellent. The clown named Pennywise, also known as ""IT"" is really really scary. When I first saw this movie I thought it would be dumb, then I saw it and I loved it. The movie is about a few kids named Bill, Ben, Beverly, Eddie, Richie, Stan, and Mike. ..."
2,Does little justice,"I thought this film was downright irritating! Not only just because the acting was wooden and the interpretation was anything but dynamic and scary, but also because it does absolutely no justice to the book. I read the book first and was transfixed by it, but the film wanders whimsically from moment to moment with little regard for plot or character development, and completely ignored the magnitude of what IT is, and where it comes from. Trust me, in the book it was more then just a giant plastic spider! Sorry for spoiling the ending, but really, if you watched the film, you wouldn't mind. Conlusion: possibly the best book I've ever read, but an appaling film."
2,"Looks like a ""Murder She Wrote"" episode","I know, I know it's from 1990 and was made for tv... but man!!Some good things: the kids, eventhough not great actors, they at least fit with the characters in the book, Pennywise is pretty scary,....that's about it!AT LOT worst then I remembered, the book is so good that a B-movie (Z-movie) is just not good enough."
2,"Story too long, ending is stupid.","Tim Curry is the best part of this movie. He's a clown that will visit you in your nightmares. But this story is way too dragged out and the ""explanation"" for the killings is ridiculous. It was a huge letdown after watching this movie for hours."
1,it is garbage,"This was the dumbest movie ever. It was not scary at all, it didn't even scare a two year old, I wanted to just throw it in the trash. I would send it back but it would cost me more for shipping & handling than it was for the movie so I have to just take this as a lost."
1,READ THE BOOK!,"I don't know what posseses Stephen King to allow his books to be made into low-budget made-for-TV movies, but he needs to stop. I really enjoyed the book and this cheesy movie does not even come close to doing it justice. Of course, to do the book justice would probably require a 10-hour movie with a huge budget. Stick with the books and don't sell them out for money Mr. King!"
2,Due for the Remake Treatment,"We were all VERY interested, as 20-somethings, that IT was being adapted for film, albeit for television, and to our further chagrin, on the ABC Network; they're notorious for ""adapting"" our favorite works by a salesman's idea of the ""acceptable.""This will be remade. Peter Jackson is the Man. PETER, WE NEED YOU TO FOCUS ON THIS ONE PROJECT FOR NOW, COULD YOU? I know KONG made billions, so you're, um, free? GOOD.GET INTO THIS NOVEL, PETER. It's your next two-part blockbuster.'Nuff said,Bobbo"
3,It- The Movie,"Although packed with a star-studded cast, the movie version of Stephen King's ""It"" fails to deliver a shutter of the suspense, horror or blood colored drama of the book. Turn off the TV, grab the book. You won't be disappointed or sleep or dare go into a sewer where this movie belongs."
4,Best TV adaptation of a King book yet.,"The only time I've seen a better casting decision then Curry as Pennywise is in the recent adaptation of Alice in Wonderand, with Martin Short as the Mad Hatter. I think the man was born and raised simply so that he could pay that part. But back to Curry. He was supurb. There are no other words for it. The rest? I cannot believe any of the older versions are in their fourties. Especially the geek. I can't remember his name right now, and I don't have the book with me. They play the parts well, but the age thing bothers me. The ending was a huge dissapointment after reading the book, of course, but...Well, how could they have improved upon it? I certainly don't have a clue. I think this was the best job that could have been done, and the best adaptation of a King book I've seen. TOmmyknockers? Come one. That was just sad."
4,A Must See!,"I first saw this movie when I was about 5. I've never been more terrified in my life. I've never liked clowns since...ever. I'm 18 and STILL hate them. This movie is amazing, used to give me night-mares in fact. It's a pretty long movie ( 2 tapes ) but if you watch it from beginning to end, you won't be dissapointed. You'll have your share of jumps and shreaks right up 'till the end. Yes, I agree with others, the ending is a ""twist"" and dissapointing, but other than that, I highly recomend you see ""IT""."
3,THE FIRST PART OF THIS FILM IS ONE SCARY RIDE!!,"I'm not easily scared of movies. The only movie that ever scared me was Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Even thats really tame, but the heart of IT is so frightning and especially when I saw it when I was 10 or 11 (I'm 18 now). This movie is a good adaption, but the book is an epic on paperback. Same deal with King's other adaption The Stand. Never does the book justice. I still think the first half of this movie is the best ever filmed for a King adaption. Just see it at least for Tim Curry's over-the-top performance as the outragious Pennywise. Also, the ending is the biggest sham of any hollywood film. A TOTAL SHAM! Hope you agree with me!"
4,the ending could have been better,i have not read the novel and didnt know anything about the movie so found it cheap and thought to watch. the first part was very good and creepy! the middle was still pretty good but the ending...well. i know the effects back in that time might not have been the best but i dont want to spoil it for anyone but lets just say it would have been a amazing' movie if the ending was just stronger. you will see once you watch it but it def is a movie you should see if you like creepy horror like the good ol days :)
5,IT'S COMING OUT ON DVD!,"Yes, you heard right, Stephen King's 'IT', brutally restrained to VHS for 12 years, is finally coming to DVD!Warner are releasing IT on the 8th October 2002 and are set to include an audio commentary by the director, Tommy Lee Wallace.Although it's not yet up for pre-order on this site, DVDFile.com has the specs and retail is set at $19.95Looks like this coming Hallowe'en is gonna be a good'un"
3,"The first half is excellent, but the second half is mediocre.","The first half of this movie is great. The acting is good, the effects are fine, and it is very true to the book. The second half however, is kinda lame. The special effects get cheesy (especially at the end), the acting is not as good as the first half, and it srayed away from the novel. Tim Curry (who looks like he is enjoying the heck out of it) is the best part of the film, it is possibly my favorite role of his. I give five stars to the first half and maybe two and a half stars for the second half."
2,Sucked,I gave this movie 2 stars only because John Ritter was in it. I would have given it 5 stars if Don Knotts was in it. But it sucked anyway!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm gonna be like the two reviewers below and make constant exclamation points!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,an ok horror flick,"i saw it when i was in 4 grade, i was scared so much. now not so much. now i think its a little stupid beacause the clown goes in the sewers. you get the rest. and its about 6 hours. Buy salems lot instead"
1,Worst movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Dont waste your money on this DVD. This is the worst movie ever, its three hours long. During the movie, I strongly considered ending my life. And ending the lives of those around me. I dont know if I Can really put how bad this movie was in prespective. The movie has no real plot, its boring, TERRIBLE ACTING, terrible story, its the worst movie ever. Stephen King should be shot for making such a terrible movie."
4,good but book is better,"when I first saw ""IT"" I thought it was great besides the ending.then I read the book.boy was I wrong.but is worth the price for curry's acting"
3,Not as scary as the book,"The movie was suspenseful, but it didn't startle or frighten me. I liked the scene in the Chinese restaurant as well as the clown. If this had been an actual movie instead of a miniseries, it would've been much better. That's my opinion, anyway."
3,To be fair to the film makers...,"...the ending is what Mr.King wrote in the book and what they had to work with, and the ending was kind of lame in the book too, but because it was just written words on a page you could imagine it/IT a lot more scarier than what the film makers could ever make."
4,"Great nightmarish movie, sucky ending!","I loved It. The It, Pennywise, was so scary! The movie was so nightmarish, like when Pennywise appears in the sewer with big yellow teeth, and saying ""they all float down here,"" that was just really scary. Once again the movie is just really nightmarish, you feel like you are in the nightmare with these helpless little kids being stalked by this nightmarish clown. The ending was really stupid though. Everything is great until the ending comes along. I recommend that you see the movie, but turn the movie off before it gets to the ending. I gotta say, 99% of the movie is really scary."
4,Good Stephen king horror movie,It is a great horror movie. But It drags some in the middle and sometimes gets boring but if you like horror see It.
4,This movie scared the sh*t out of me!!!!!,"This movie is really, really scary. I first saw it when I was little and now I'm scared of clowns! I've tried to read the book but that is scarier. I wouldn't let anyone under ten watch this, it really scared my 13 year old cousin. The best part is when that guy is kissing that chick and it turns out it is Pennywise the Clown. This is a fantastic performance from the great Tim Curry. If you enjoy his performance in ""IT"" I recomand you see Tim Curry in the Tales from the Crypt episode ""Death of some Salesman"". He plays an entire family in that and the father reminds me of Pennywise the Clown. Tim was Emmy nominated for that episode."
2,Crappy ending,"There is a lot of build up in the movie - was very suspensful but then when you get to the end of the movie all I could say is ""what the heck""!!! It was like the writer had a great story but no idea how to end it."
4,My Childhood Movie,"I remember that childhood movie very well. When I saw it on T.V. for same reason the two parallel stories where chronological. I saw the childhood part first then when they are old without flashbacks. I don`t know. When I see it now, it`s better but that`s how I saw it when I was young.A beautiful story of friendship and of the meaning of the loser`s club. I liked the book as well."
3,wasnt what I expected.,"When I was younger I loved the movie IT so naturally when I saw it on Amazon I had to purchase it, but it just not the same."
4,Pretty good,"This was a gift for my Mother. I wathched it with her , and found IT to be quite intersting."
4,please don't compare,"O.K., for the last time : motion pictures DO NOT EQUAL books. Books are bigger effort & time investments that pay off big in intellectual terms. Motion pictures can't possibly capture the detail of a book, but they pay off by stimulating your senses in a way that a book can't. Like a Stephen King novel or don't, like a Stephen King movie or don't, but for God's sake QUIT TRYING TO COMPARE APPLES AND ORANGES."
5,IT!!!!,Love this movie. Glad I found it on dvd. We have been looking everywhere for it and found it here.
4,a really good movie,"Of course the book is better, I mean, what movie have you seen where the book is worse? It's not as good as Halloween or the Exorcist, but it's still a good movie to watch when it's dark out. Annette O' Toole was very good and so was John Ritter. My favorite actor in this movie, though, was Tim Curry. I never imagined Mr. Curry playing an evil clown who eats children, but he plays it very well. Rent this movie, some seens will creep you out."
4,One of the better adaptations...,"The problem with Stephen King is that his books rarely get translated to film very well. Certainly not at the level as something more simplistic, like Harry Potter. But for the adaptations done so far, this is definately one of the better ones, with The Stand also showing that miniseries are the way to translate King's vision to celluloid.IT has a masterful performance by Tim Curry as Pennywise. Although many aspects of the book have still been left out, and some things changed, the story manages to contain much of the essence of the printed page. Certainly better and less cheesy than some of the more horrid ""Based on a story by Stephen King"" material, like Maximum Overdrive or the unfortunately rather B-movie-esque Christine.I only hope than when and if The Talisman gets done, it does a better job than all the rest."
3,Truly Scary First Half is Marred...,"...by mini-series production of the second half. When Curry as Pennywise shows up around the playing children of the town is when the biggest chills come. In fact these scenes stop short of being way too disturbing...maybe that whole 'clowns are funny until they are close up on you' thing is something I have to work on, but I would not reccommend any kid to see the first part. The second 'adult' part has some serious overacting by Anderson, Thomas and Ritter in particular, and it gets marks for the campiness I think fans like (a la Castle or Corman moovys or the masterful ""Dark Shadows"" tv show)."
5,Great Scary Movie,"Alright, I saw this movie about a month ago and loved it. The movie has scary scenes to make it a scary movie. The other part of this movie I liked were some of the comedy parts. I mean the movie doesn't really have any but if you took what they said into something different it is funny. I really enjoyed watching this movie. 50% scary, 50% funny."
2,meh,"This movie was good the first time, but boring after that. The characters are interesting as kids, but are boring as grown-ups. Tim Curry was great as the clown. Definatly the highlight of the movie. It is missing a lot of the most interesting parts of the book, but the book was way too long."
1,Nothing like the book,"The tone is totally off. Major parts of the book have been changed. The ""happy"" music in different parts of the movie just do not fit. Clearly some studio jerk wanted the movie to be more ""happy"" then the story really was. Worst adaptation of a book I have seen. Most of the acting is horrible."
2,Can't believe I used to like this!,"OK... I admit that i did like this one when i was in middle school. However, when I went to watch it again it seemed hokey and kind of dull. People have told me that this movie made them afraid of clowns for the rest of their lives, but i cant really see it. I was never scared because of this movie even as a kid. The ending was beyond horrible. This supreme fear being was defeated by people punching the spider version of IT in the stomach. This really isnt worth it."
2,Won't add PJ Tracy to my list of 'must read' authors,"I was so disappointed with this book. The sales blurb made it sound like one of those books I would read in one sitting; instead I had to force myself to keep going. The characters never became real for me and the narrative didn't flow and was stilted. In addition the whole thing was so unbelievable - even taking the point above about the Twin Towers. In short, I wanted a good read and got a mediocre one. Maybe if I had read the other books first, I would have liked this better. As it is I won't be buying the previous ones."
3,Just OK,"This was my first book by P.J. Tracy and I found it to be just OK. There wasn't anything exceptionally great about it. I did have a problem, however, with the amount of characters in there. It was mind boggling at times. Nonetheless, I would recommend this book to anyone."
3,"ok plot, bad editing!","ok plot, bad editing! they kept talking about how quiet it was but they couldn't hear a huge RV going breakneck speeds on country roads until it pulled up right in front of them? that is only one of the many inconsistencies I found. One must read it all the way through without stopping because if you stop you'll notice these things. also having never read the first two books the characters were completely faceless to me. only harley and sheriff ed pitala were explained in any way gave them 'life'. not bad for an airplane read I guess."
1,Disappointing Read,"This book would have to be the biggest load of feminist talkfeast I have had to endure in a long, long time. Destined for the round rubbish bin under the desk. Only woman can save the world - yeah right!! Truly unbelievable rubbish masquerading as a story line. Yet this is the sort of garbage which publishers are foisting on us mere readers these days. Perhaps we need more Ian Fleming's so we at least get some puerile sexist balance back. Fleming's single advantage over this tiresome novel is at least his books were short."
2,Monkeeing around with credible plotting!,"The latest in the 'Monkeewrench' series is yet another departure from the fresh originality of the first volume. Once again, the atracy's have alternated the focus of the characters, so that we now have Grace, Annie, and Sharon in a 'girls road trip to hell', with the 'menfolk' of the police force left at home trying to piece the mystery together.As a suspense story, this isn't bad, but the 'nerve gas' plot line seems like it came out of an unused Tom Clancy chapter, or perhaps an 'A Team' rerun! The Tracys seem to enjoy coming up with 'improbably probable' scenarios and criminals (see their first two books), but the 'villains' here just seem to have been tacked onto the story because somebody had to behind everything...and because this isn't a 'Friday the 13th' type horror movie, after all!I'm afraid the plot went as far off course as the Monkeewrench crew did...hope they all hitched a ride back to Minnesota in the Mystery Machine with Shag and Scoob."
2,Not worth reading,"Not only was the plot unbelievable throughout the entire book, but the ending was terrible. If the authors wish to write about computers, they should do some research first and learn how computers work.The dual-author thing is strange also. One of the authors is definitely worse than the other. They should part ways."
4,A cracking read!,"July 12, 2006I enjoyed this book...it was a combination of the characters (whom I knew from the previous two books) and the tense plot that kept me turning the pages.I like books that can help me escape for an hour or two...this one lost me for a day!Farfetched plot? Yes, maybe slightly, but then it could be because it hasn't happened yet. 9/11 was farfetched once.If you've enjoyed the first two of PJ Tracy's novels then this one will not disappoint."
3,Read the other two books first!,"With a great premise, engaging writing style, and interesting suspense this should have added up to a great book. My problem was that I didn't know the characters, and I think there was an assumption by the writers that I already did. I didn't read the first two books with these characters, didn't even know there were two others. I picked this up at a store for quick reading while doing some extreme hospital visiting. It was easy to read, and really fun to read, but there were a lot of characters and I couldn't really tell them apart. Sharon was a cop with a past, Grace was an agent with a past (or was she? - one week later, and I have forgotten), and Annie was heavy and wore flowing clothing. While I could keep these separate, events from their past were hinted at but not explained. The male officers were very hard to differentiate, and I gave up trying.Read the other two books first, then come back to this one, and it would probably be very enjoyable."
5,Dead Run is a great thriller...,"However, you must read the 1st two books in the series first to get to know the characters and their past situations. This is only a plus however, because the first two books are as good as Dead Run. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes non-stop action."
1,Failed effort with a foolish plot,"I am constantly searching for new authors who create quality efforts and sadly this mom/daughter team is not one of those. The plots are unbelievable and the characterizations are stale. The cop who eats too much, the computer geeks, the strong yet vulnerable women, the grizzled local sherrifs, etc. ad nauseum. One aditional gripe...no woman who is 100 pounds overweight is sexy even if she ""showed a lot of cleavage and a lot of plump, delicious leg"". This is amateur hour at its best and shows how easy it is to publish bad books today."
4,Good read,"I was looking for a new author & stumbled on ""Off the Grid"" in the bookstore. Liked it so much I went back and bought all of the Monkeewrench books. Enjoyed the characters and the twists are sometimes surprising."
5,This one hits the mark,"I liked this one a lot. The hero must not only find a serial killer, but also keep the parents of his dead wife from wooing his two kids away from him. The scary thing is that something like this could really happen"
4,Retro recipes my grandmothers were probably familiar with,"I'm enjoying the cookbook - reading it is very entertaining. So far, I've tried Barney's Salt & Pepper Steak, and it was a big hit for a home-cooked Sunday dinner. Look forward to trying out some more recipes in the near future!"
3,cute but disappointing,"I think the black and white episodes of the Andy Griffith Show are probably the best examples of American TV ever made, so I was thrilled to order this book. There are no photos at all which makes it tedious to flip through. Also, every recipe insists on having a character's name in the title. It's cute for the first few pages but gets tiresome very quickly. I can't imagine Ernest T. Bass cooking anything and if he did I don't believe I would want to try it. However, there are many, many pieces of dialogue reproduced exactly as they were said on the show and it is delightful to read them! How funny simple American dialect can be... This book is a fun momento of the classic Americana sitcom, but don't expect to cook much from it."
5,aunt bees cookbook,"this product is great, not only do you get some great recipes but if your a Mayberry fan, some great stories from the show. It brings back memories. I purchased a few and will be using then as Christmas gifts. The service was great and I received them promptly. Very satisfied with product."
2,I LOVE IT!!!,You must have this cd to complete your christmas collection. I too grew up listening to the record. Now that I have it on cd I can pass on this cherished tradition to my children.
1,Still waiting!!,"I have been invited to review a product which I am still waiting for after it was scheduled to be delivered no later than Dec 17th.Firstly get your act together and deliver the damn thing, then maybe I can submit a review!!"
5,Old School Holiday Classic,"It was the early 60's when i got my first ""record player"" & the holiday selections Santa provided included Elvis....Johnny Cash...Chubby Checker/Bobby Rydell...& stuck somewhere in the middle was this much loved balladeer i had never heard of. The standard holiday tunes are here along with a very entertaining southwestern number (Senior Santa Claus). ""An Old Christmas Card"" will remind you to cherish what you have now for it will be gone sooner than you realize. I'm glad to say i can remember when country music was more than cry in your beer or MTV grade tecno videos. If you know & appreciate Jim Reeves you will enjoy this music. If you don't but want to remember a simpler time & the joy of Christmas i highly recommend it. His voice has & will continue to withstand the test of time."
5,It Ain't Christmas Without Jim,"I grew up listening to this album. Every year this was one of the main holiday albums that my parents played. Now, everytime I play it, Christmas memories are everywhere. My very young kids are now enjoying this album, and I hope that when they have their own children, they will have great Chrismtas memories too."
5,"thank u, senor reeves","thank u, senor reeves for recording the spirit of christmas in these 12 jewels.i woke up to these songs every christmas. all my friends growing up in bombay(india) did too!i promise my unborn kids...u will too!i was so thrilled to find it on cd!"
1,"Very disappointing, do not buy",Bilibin is a great illustrator but the reproductions in this book do his work a great disservice.The book is very small and the illustrations are only A5 size and most are half that size. The print quality is very poor and combined with the matt paper makes the colours dull and muddy. Compared to the original Russian editions this book looks like it has been printed on newsprint with a very low quality photocopier.So bad I threw the book out.
4,Definitely Worth the Price,"Yes, the illustrations are reduced to a smaller size than one might like and, yes, the colors are flatter than they presumably are in the originals. But for about $10 you get a very attractive, 180+ page, hard cover book with a sample of more than 50 of Ivan's Bilibin's gorgeous fairy tale illustrations, all but one or two in color and many full, or even double page.For the price, I don't think you can go wrong if you're at all interested in Russian fairy tale stories and illustrations. By way of comparison. I recently ran across some Russian editions of illustrated Russian fairy tale books, including at least one illustrated by Biliban, at a Russian gift Shop in Oakland, CA. They were larger format and the reproduction of the illustrations was somewhat better, but the were paperback, only about 32 pages, and cost $29.95 each if I remember correctly."
3,"Nice, but the Bilibin paintings are hard to see","It's a nice book. However I bought it for all the Ivan Bilibin illustrations & for some reason the book was printed on a mid tone, cream stock and so the brilliant Bilibin colours that he is justly famous for, are very muted, almost muddy...much of his marvelous details are even hard to see. His work should be printed a on bright white stock imo. Still glad to have the book,the writing looks good, but what a disappointment."
4,Works very good,Spreads pepper at the same rate you would by hand and does a very nice job.On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it an 8.9
1,Don't Waste Your Money . . .,"After searching high and low for a reasonably priced electric pepper mill, I decided to give this one a try, as I liked the look and the price.I'm sorry I wasted my time and money, as I now have to return this piece of junk, after fighting with it for 30 minutes to try and get it to work.Sending it back immediately. Sigh."
2,You get what you pay for.,This mill feels cheap with all its plastic parts. I was disapointed that the mill often gets clogged or will not grind so that you have to release the button over and over to get amount of pepper you want. One of my biggest gripes is the huge chunks of peppercorn not ground up. My boyfriend argues this point as he likes the bigger pieces better.
2,Not brand new...,"The product itself is lovely and fits the specs as stated, but mine came in packaging that definitely showed signs of prior use. Stickers were ripped out of packaging, and worse still, my mill came half-full of pepper. Not for the faint of heart."
4,I like it,"the peppermill is a good product for the money. It sits on my kitchen table, looks good and everybody uses it!"
1,useless,"I bought this to replace a wonderful product that was no longer available. The old product used 9 batteries. This one uses only 4 and it is not powerful enough. After a feeble spit of pepper, it would no longer grind. Tried taking it apart and cleaning it, adjusting the coarseness of the grind: to no avail. It's going in the trash."
1,JUNK!!!!,"I bought this grinder based on the reviews and believe me they must have been planted because this is the worst pepper mill I have ever used. I am returning it even though I'll lose money because it's completely useless. I'd give it negative stars if I could! It does not grind the pepper evenly. It's more like cracked pepper and the chunks of pepper when you grind it range anywhere from whole peppercorns, half peppercorns, some coarse and some fine pepper flakes. The adjustment knob on the bottom does nothing as far as I can tell except maybe give you a few more or less whole or half cracked peppercorns with the grind. I wanted some coarse ground pepper for a salad and ended up having to put what came out of this mill in a plastic bag and smash it with a mallet to get a coarse grind suitable for a salad so I wouldn't have to bite down on huge chunks of pepper."
1,Completely fell apart,"Needed a one-handed pepper mill for SO who's had a stroke. I put this together - very easy - but the problem is, it won't stay together. The casing over the batteries would not attach, and the whole thing fell apart upon my attempts to use it. I had peppercorns flying all over the kitchen. Back it goes to Amazon."
5,Trudeau Pepper Mill,Had one like this one and dropped it and sadly broke it. Had to order another. Love this one also. Order came timely and well packaged as usual from Amazon on Prime shipping. Can't beat Prime shipping. This handy Trudeau pepper mill is by far the best yet in my opinion.
2,Loved the first one I owned!!!,"I purchased one of these a few years ago. I loved it, and it finally bit it!!! So, I bought a new one here, and it never ran more than 10 seconds!!! I thought it was my batteries. I kept going to the store and buying new ones, but the peppermill never lasted more than 10 seconds, then no seconds. I've never really had a chance to use it and it saddens me, because by the time I pack it up and ship it back, it's about the same monetarily as just throwing it in the garbage!!! Perhaps a different brand may work longer than 10 seconds???!!! :("
4,Great pepper mill!,If you love fresh ground pepper you need this! It's the perfect size. A lot I've seen are too big to handle with one hand and use a lot of batteries. This one only uses 2. The cons are that you go through a lot of pepper! :)
3,Just Ok,I wonder if I got someone elses return as there were no peppercorns in it. It works ok but takes forever to grind enough pepper while I'm cooking. Would be ok to put on a dinner table when you just need a small amount.
5,Awesome Item,"I have tried many types of battery operated pepper mills over the years as I love being able to use it with one hand only. Makes things ever so much faster and easier. This has been one of the best so far (owned about a month, use almost daily). It's easy to fill, doesn't fall apart (many do!)and is very dependable. The last one I tried was a squeeze one rather than battery operated and you had to wear yourself out for several minutes to get a mere sprinkling of pepper. This one works great and seems to be soundly constructed."
1,Worthless,"This pepper mill is a joke. First of all, it is not a stainless steel finish as advertised. Instead it is chrome covered plastic. It took me 1/2 an hour to get the thing to power up after putting in the batteries. Finally it kicked in and worked for about 10 seconds, spitting out little bits of pepper - then it died altogether. I had to wait a few minutes for it to cool down before it would grind again. Worthless product - don't waste your money!"
3,Good little grinder...,"I bought this grinder so I would have any easy way to grind fresh pepper one-handed while cooking. It does exactly what it's supposed to; no finesse but adequate to the task. It doesn't hold a whole lot of peppercorns, but I really don't find that I have to refill it very often. It's easy to fill. Batteries seem to last a long time. It is not a speed grinder either; I can grind faster with a manual grinder. But because of the one-handed benefit, I just don't mind that much. My stepson thinks it's pretty cool and despite my fancy stainless steel hand grinder, he brings this one in from the kitchen to use at the table. Go for it, just don't expect to be stunned by its fabulousness."
2,Pepper grinder,"We had a Trudeau pepper mill for almost a year before it died. My husband loved it so I decided to get him another one. Unfortuately, this pepper mill's motor does not have enough power to grind the peppercorns. There must be some little thing wrong with it as the other one worked great."
4,A well written study guide,"While prepping for the ACT I used many books, however McGraw-Hill's guide stands out from the others (princeton review etc) because it is so well written. There are tons of practice problems in the book which I found extremely helpful. Practice is the only guaranteed technique to improve your ACT/SAT score, and that's where many of the competitors fall short. The Real ACT book by the makers of the test was also an excellent buy."
3,Interview HEAVY collection ..Ringside Tyson has far more content,This is a fabulous collection of interviews and the SPORTSCENTURY show on Mike Tyson which is fascinating viewing. The fight section has 6 fights. The Ringside Tyson 2 DVD collection has 19 fights and an hour of interviews so I give it the edge if you are a Tyson collector you may want both (all 6 of the fights on this are also on the Ringside Tyson 2 DVD set if that helps?)
5,"LOVE HIM OR HATE HIM,BUT HE IS A BOXING LEGEND.","This dvd is cool as it has all new documentries on Iron Mike Tyson,no matter what you say about Iron Mike Tyson,his record as the youngest heavyweight boxing champion in history will take some beating and remains up there as one of the greatest records in all of world wide sports,it is just a shame Mike let money and woman destroy him,as he could have become the greatest of all time."
1,Yikes,"This may be the worst recording I've ever heard. The children are shouting the melodies, the piano accompaniment is pedantic (some of this is poor arrangement); and, just when you've heard an entire song or carol, and expect to be relieved by the next track - why, the kids repeat the entire song."
3,10 AND UNDER,"The movie is based on the idea that ""Treasure Island"" was not fictional. This was discovered by two different people about the same time who battle for the treasure.Randy Quaid leads a group of kooky pirates who have to compete with the inept owner/operators of a kids' camp. The acting is pure ham. The kids are stereotyped into impossible characters. The script is bad and filled with slap stick and low brow humor including a horse with a gas problem.As always in kids movies, adults are stupid and kids must save the day. This film will work well with kids with a low maturity level, say under tweens, but would never be a good movie for teens or adults. Robert Louis Stevenson is rolling over in his grave."
5,[Review Update] After Experiencing their Cult,"I should have posted this UPDATED review a long time ago in 2004.Like any spiritual seeker I was reading many different spiritual books, and Gyatso's books seemed genuine to me as I love the teachings of BUDDHA.In a nutshell, I joined their ""meditation"" group and went further to be trained as a teacher. What happened is SHOCKING.They informed me that I could NOT write my own books!!!!They told me I could not discuss any of the teachings!They told me I could NOT write ARTICLES.I couldn't believe how controlling this cult organization is. They give glory to Kelsang Gyatso - where a true Buddhist gives the glory to Buddha.If you are looking for excellent Buddhist books I do *NOT* recommend this book, or any of the other Gyatso books. I do recommend the books by Eknath Easwaran such as THE DAMMAPADA.I share this with the utmost pure motives and hope it helps you in your spiritual growth."
5,perfect level of spirituality,"This is JC at her best. This little book is not preachy but fresh in its approach on all angles of life, with easy reading in a pleasant format. I bought it for myself when I was going thru some tough emotional times several years ago, and still keep it around to read a page from here and there, just for perspective. More recently, I bought it for someone dear to me who has just gone thru a divorce. It's uplifting and genuine in its gentle message."
2,Lacks important features,"This is overall a good vcr but it lacks some really obvious features. The lighted display on the front tells the time, etc., but it does not tell you when the unit is playing, rewinding, fast forwarding, etc. It does have a record indication, but it is so small you can't read it from 5 feet away. This may seem trivial, but when I am on the couch, I like the visual feedback of what mode the vcr is in when I'm going back or forward through a movie, or when I'm recording. Seems like pretty simple features that it ought to have, and I have always seen on other vcrs."
3,Commercial Advance Needs Some Work,"This model has some great features but they need some fine tuning. Unfortunately the commercial advance needs the most work. It does very well on basic commercials but seems to miss almost all commercials for the network's upcoming shows. It is also quite frustrating if you've recorded say, a Yankees/Red Sox game. It cuts off the final play of almost every inning!! This forces you to watch with your finger on the play button every time there are two outs! The commercial advance also takes a long time to mark the commercials. A basic 1 hour show will take almost 15 minutes to mark. On the positive side... the menu is very easy to set up and use, and the auto tracking is great. Basic features such as rewinding will be difficult to use without the remote(you end up holding down the button for almost 10 seconds); so if you frequently lose the remote this is not the model for you!"
5,Superb book on a majestic breed!,"Here it is all in one place: history, care, selection, and activities of Alaskan Malamutes. The breed history not only includes information on founding kennels and influential dogs but also the expeditions on which they were a part of. It doesn't try to sugar coat ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" of these expeditions. Want to show your Mal? There's a great chapter on this as well, including show grooming information that's valuable to any northern breed owner. The illustrations and photos are excellent, and includes some in color. A must-have for the serious Malamute fancier! Bravo! This is a book I've been waiting for!"
5,Highly recommended guide to a hardy and enduring species of man's best friend,"The Alaskan Malamute Yesterday And Today is a hardcover compendium of virtually everything there is to know about the Alaskan Malamute breed of dog. From the history of this celebrated canine, to in-depth instructions and recommendations for the selection, care, training, and grooming of one's own Malamute, to pedigree and bloodline information concerning the formation of the breed, extensive information to be weighed when contemplating breeding Malamutes, and much more, The Alaskan Malamute Yesterday And Today is valuable as a breeder resource, a pet owner's reference, and a true dog lover's treasury. A profusion of lack-and-white photographs throughout illustrate this comprehensive and highly recommended guide to a hardy and enduring species of man's best friend."
2,Touched by an Angel,I was overjoyed with the product but disappointed when my mother contacted me and said the dvd would not play on her player. I have since discovered that they are region 1 DVD's and Australia is region 4. Now my mother has to purchase a compatible machine. I was unaware of this criteria when purchasing overseas products.
2,Big mistake,I am highly disappointed in this gun.It misfired right out of the box. I've never owned a Grizzly item before and I am sure this will be my only one unless someone can convinced me otherwise. I had 45 sheets of beadboard to put up and I almost have to fire it twice on every hit. Not good!
5,elegant and contemporary,"My sister used these flutes to celebrate her marriage. She loved the silver ring around the edge, which made the very contemporary style simple and classic."
5,Incredible Live Record,Savatage has put out one of the best live records I have ever heard. It hightlights the glory days of Savatage when Jon and Chris Oliva were the frontmen of this great band. My favorite songs on the recording are Dungeons are Calling and Sirens. They absolutely blew me away and are much better than the album versions. Every song is a jem and I could never get tired of this record. Turn your stereo up and prepare to rocked!
5,Just Brilliant,"What a book, all three Timuras in one edition, a must for every discerning fantasy reader. Allan Cole weaves such a magickal web of tales it will have you gripped from page one, i know i was and still am every time i read them. What a stunning book, i can't wait to get a copy of it to stand proudly in my special book cupboard. WELL DONE ALLAN another classic."
5,That's It! - So much more on so many levels,"That's It! Thoughts of Fantasies, Half-Truths, and Outright Lies is a startlingly frank exploration of an incredible range of common emotions and life experiences from a uniquely masculine and African-American perspective. The openess and honesty of this compilation of poems and short stories transcends the boundaries of race and gender to resonate with most readers, who have ever experienced love, loss, the exhilaration of the creative process, and the struggle to connect with a partner as well as friends, family, and community. Written with a refreshingly masculine point of view and with a perspicuity not often captured even by other male poets and authors, That's It! appeals to men by giving an articulate voice to many of the shared feelings and truths of the male experience, while welcoming women to a unique window on the male soul."
4,solid Dave Alvin,"Dave is great, he is in a league of talents that is a small circle. The filming is typical ACL and the sound is good. That's not what this guy is about. He has a sensitivity and way of seeing life in the USA that not many have. His acoustic set is great and the electric gets even better. If you're wondering if you should buy this don't worry, it's money well spent. And don't miss a chance to see him in person."
1,Not for me.,"I once had a job with long hours and low pay and felt very exploited. I hated it, and it went on for several years, until I decided to maybe upgrade my value to society. Music like The Blasters was a way I could make a bad day better, and pretty much every day was a bad day. Not too many people can really play like that, but Dave Alvin is one of them. A song like Marie, Marie could really make you forget how much life sucked. Other than Marie, Marie, the songs on this DVD are of the sort that reminded me of how much life sucked, and thus I hated them then and I hate them now. What a waste of talent! I skipped over every song and filed it away in my DVD case and will probably never put it in a DVD player again."
2,Dave Alvin DVD,"The lyrics are hard to hear because of poor mixing. Was never a big Blasters fan but if you love Dave Alvin you will like it. I am basically indifferent about it; not bad, not real good."
3,Where's the music?,"I have to say I was really bummed out when I opened the book and didn't find all the music I was expecting.The theme is missing,Evacuating London and Lucy Meets Mr.Tumnus were cut in half,and the four songs at the end of the soundtrack took up 2/3 of the book.There just wasn't enough music from the movie to make it worth buying."
2,Terrible!,"I can't reccomend this book. Harry-Gregson Williams for Narnia was excellent, but only four of the songs in this book are acutually by him, and of those, two are cut in half. Tumnus Lullaby doesn't have the same effect on the piano, at least not in this arrangement. Also worth noting is that this book, at least the score sections, are very easy. I could sightread every song. Anyway, I can't recommend this book unless you're a collector."
4,Love what IS here... Wish there was more,"I admit to being disappointed by the songs that are missing from this book. Only the Beginning of the Adventure especially. The fact that a couple of the songs are incomplete wasn't too encouraging, either.BUT...Harry Gregson-Williams is a genious when it comes to music, and these tunes are absolutely beautiful. They are a must-have for any piano-playing Narnia fan. Those who have had enough training (or are born naturals) will be able to fill in some of the missing parts just by having what's here.So I'm not as happy as I wanted to be, but I'm not completely disappointed, either."
2,Steppin,"A college campus springs to life when the local radio station announces the official opening of the step competition season. At UTS, the Greeks rule the campus but the Steppers are the kings of the hill. Step season is underway, and with a big money prize up for grabs the heat is on. As the fraternities and sororities work to recruit the best talent around, dance fever sweeps the campus. The plot of this movie was not that bad but it was very low budget. It does have it's funny moments with guest appearances from Anthony Anderson, Faizon Love, Monique and many others that you may have seen from previous movies. But the movie did leave you wondering at the end. There were some things left out and the timeline was a little off. The quality of the picture was definetly the worst part. Not even worth the rental."
2,Not a good movie!,"Overall, I rate this movie a 2 because the plot was very weak. It was obviously a low budget movie with well known actors and actresses in it. However, these otherwise good actors/actresses couldn't make this movie good at all in my opinion."
1,This Fusion should just Vaporise,"Sounds like John Mcluaghlin?-I don't think so,nor is Larry as imaginative as Allan Holdsworth,or any where near as precise,which is strange considering Allan can play more slowly with better enunciation, or faster with less mistakes.Is this music really a ""Fusion"", maybe not,it is however a long , laborious struggle from go to whoa.Better check some Holdsworth,Scofield,Jeff Beck,or Dixie Dregs,maybe even a little Eric Johnson, then listen again to Mr. Coryell."
1,Gag Me To Death,"This is one of the worst fusion albums ever made. Try The Essential Larry Coryell. Try Mark Isham, the Silent Way Project or Miles Davis, Dark Magus or Tronzo, Night in Amnesia."
2,Marginal,This is a required text for a course in Multicultural Education. I find it to be full of stereotypes and not very informative.
3,It's okay.,"The book I received was not just ""used."" It had been used by many many students. I am confident to say this because there're many many same labels on the cover. But suprisingly, the notes and highlighting/underlining are very limited. Without considering the worn cover, the condition of this book is ""good."" The book itself is boring to read. After last semester, I sold this book!"
1,Multicultural Education in a Pluralistic Society (8 ed.),"This text book is totally unacceptable! It is in poor shape and should include a CD, which is missing. This book will be returned as soon as I replace it. It is needed for a class which begins December 31st. The description for the book was the reason it was ordered, but I am completely dissatisfied with the purchase!"
1,My Condolences to the Reader,"""Multicultural Education in a Pluralistic Society"" was a required textbook for a graduate class. I particularly appreciate when an author of a book at least attempts to disguise their bias in an effort to offer a more balanced approach. However, the author of this textbook failed miserably."
2,Not too great,"I am having to read this book for a multi-cultural teaching class, on my way to become a teacher. From the 1st chapter, I realized it is really a book all about bashing our dominant culture, here in the U.S. The only reason that I give the book 2 stars rather than 1 is because it is so badly and erroneously written (so much is taken out of historical context to bash the US) that it is forcing me to really look at our history and find out what really happened, because the book is definitely not an accurate depiction of the world."
3,Incomplete,I bought this book used to use for a college class. The book did not come with the DVD that it was supposed to have. This has caused problems for me because I need the DVD to complete some of my assignments. The condition of the book was just ok not good and was stated when I purchased it.
1,-9 Stars,"We should be able to rate items with negative stars.According to this book, white people...""see themselves as superior to persons and groups of color""""take no responsibility for society's racism""""have little or no experience with discrimination""""have no experience of knowing or feeling racism""""are really not interested in eliminating racism because they never recognize it or choose to ignore it""The list goes on.The authors state these assertions as absolute fact. How ironic that one of them is a white woman. They constantly write about white people stereotyping others, and yet they are stereotyping whites with no evidence for their claims. I emailed the authors to ask them for some proof of their ridiculous statements and received no response. I had to spend $80 on this book for a GRADUATE level education course. This book isn't about being a successful teacher of diverse students, it's about smearing the ""dominant, privileged group."""
3,Good textbook,"Eh, the textbook is for school, no real pleasure reading. Good information. Makes you think and expands your knowledge. Good for teachers."
1,cruel & unusual punishment,"Certainly, the assignment of this book in a graduate level course must be covered under the Geneva Convention. Not only is it poorly written, but it is intellectually shallow -- nothing but an assemblage of hackneyed cliches about how horrible the ""dominant culture"" in America is. I cannot believe that I have been assigned this trite tome as the sole text in a GRADUATE level course. What's even worse, it provides virtually no guidance for current or prospective educators about how to effectively teach a classroom full of students of disparate races, cultures, religions and socio-economic backgrounds. What a shame that is, since this is such a very real need in education today. Thank goodness this is only for a 4-week summer intersession. That this book is in its 5TH EDITION is simply beyond comprehension."
2,Biased!,"While this book may contain some good information on multicultrual education I find it difficult to get past the bias presented in it. Based on statements like""A crucial fact in understanding racism is that whites see themselves as superior to persons and groups of color, and as a result exercise their power to prevent people of color from securing the prestige, power, and privilege held by whites.""and""Whites go through a developmental stages as they develop their racial identity and abandon racism.""The authors seem to presume that all whites are racist, power hungry, pigs. Knowing that such a generalization is patently false how can I trust the content describing peoples of other cultural backgrounds."
1,Waste of time,"While I can't imagine anybody buying this book unless required to for a class, let me warn you away just in case. It's bad. I mean really bad. The writing is completely without any sort of character or flair. It's only point seems to be that white men are all super lucky and they suck. Personal agenda by the authors, perhaps? Anyway, if it is a required text for a class, complain to the instructor. I wish I had."
1,The book is one sided,"I was required to read this book for college. I was excited about the book until I realized how one sided it is. It mainly talks about problems african americans have. Doesn't talk about native americans, asian americans, or hispanic americans much. It also isn't politically correct. They call different culture groups native americans, asian americans, hispanic americans, african americans and white. Although sometimes it states european americans instead but the authors should have stated european americans from the begining since they did for the rest of the ethnic groups. It was also one sided on the role of women. It made it seem like growing up to be a ""girl"" was a bad thing and a stay at home mom should feel bad because she's not in school. In my opinion, this book is one sided, biased and a waste of time. I am reading the 8th edition and cannot believe it got this far."
1,Boring,"Overwritten, boring, politicized. I had to buy this for a class and I immediately resold it at the end of the semester."
2,Yawn,"Both books of hers are OK, I guess. It seemed to me that both books pretty much stated the same stuff, nothing different. I was looking forward to more on the scene stories.....oh well, she was great on CTC...."
5,A Must Read !!!!!!!!!,"How many times have you wondered what if? Dr Amatuzio has truly given the world a gift in this book. It reads quickly and leaves you asking for more. If you are in the healing professions you must read this book. If you have ever lost a loved one you must read this book. If only we could all open our eyes to what is happening around us the way Dr. Amatuzio describes in this book, the world would truly be a kinder gentler place!"
1,Not all there,"The book was very interesting except, it was factory flawed. There were 4 disc and the second and third were the same. They didn't have another to replace it. But they did give me a full refund. From what I listened to it would have been a keeper. Just the information I was looking for."
2,Forever Ours not worth the read,"Nothing new here. Same old, same old. The stories oft told of ""feeling a presence"", innocuous happenings after the death of a person leading one to think they'd been ""visited"". Nothing that would persuade a thinking person that the soul survives the body."
5,Freedom From Fear of Death,"You'll know the secret after you read Dr. Janis Amatuzio's comforting book.Remember, if you never had loved, you never would have a need to grieve. Love connects you to others and love, as an energy, may transform, but never dies. Proust adds this wisdom: ""The path to wisdom is not in seeing new vistas, but in having new eyes.""""Forever Ours"" gives you the courage to have new eyes."
3,Interesting read.,"This seems to be a popular topic right now. I enjoyed reading, just not a favorite of the many books I have been reading lately."
3,Mixes Spirituality into the Realm of Science,"There are a number of moving stories in this collection, all of which are senstively told. While the author is a scientist -- a forensic pathologist -- she stresses the spiritual elements of death. Most interesting are those who experience near-death experiences and are resuscitated. All report leaving their bodies and looking down on themselves and then ascending to a bright light with new colors and smiling loved ones who have previously departed. Also interesting are the many spiritual signs of death -- visits from long departed when one is about to die and then visits from the recently dead to the grieving in the form of dreams or visions.But what about the vast majority of us who never get any signs or visions? The book, for that reason, provides limited comfort. However, the author's ability to accept spirituality with her science is admirable."
3,Enlightening,"I have read many books of this type before, having suffered grief, and am always looking for a different slant on the afterlife. Because the writer in this instance is coming from the aspect of science, I found it all the more believable. The book is well written and and I did enjoy reading it but I didn't really learn anything I already hadn't read about. I would still recommend this book to fellow seekers."
2,34%*(65)*&##354*#(76^7)(216)=,"Exactly. This is what the book looks like if you go to a store right now and open it. This book is virtually a math book although physics is about 60% math and 30% science information, this book is like 95% to 5%. Not only that the explainations for some of the problems are really bad. The reason why people think physics is hard is b/c of books like these that make it hard. THEIR are even mistakes in the formulas they use and they dont round numbers to significant digits. Im the top of my class in physics only b/c i like science, this book can change your mind real fast. The book does not explain who and how which is vital in learnig and passing any science test. For example Isaac Newton proposed the law of gravity. It just tells you concepts and terms that came from nowhere. The only good part about it is webassign that lets you practice problems online. d."
5,Aaron Neville - Warm Your Heart,Excellent musical mix. Done by one of the finest vocal performers today.
1,A one-song CD,"I bought the CD for his rendition of Randy Newman's ""Louisiana 1927"". Nice. Rest of the CD is a snooooooozzzze"
5,Battery,This battery was purchased for a red dot gun scope. The battery must be silver Oxide to work in the sight. This battery worked well.
3,Very nice but get ugly quick,"Hi, my sandals are nice, (blue color) but what I didn't like is the fact of the pad is made of satin, so no matter how clean are your feet or how you care when you walk, it gets dirty and dull (when you try to clean it)"
1,disappointed,"When I ordered this, I was led to believe it was video karaoke; however, it seems it is only a CD and you have to read the lyrics from the included folder."
4,"A fun, mathy record...","Coalesce is one of the tighter math metal groups I've stumbled across lately, in the vein of the Dillinger Escape Plan, but less dissonant in their harmonic approach, and using much more low-tuned riffery.Some of the riffs bring to mind Led Zepplin to me, actually; I'm not sure what it is about them, but they have a sort of Jimmy Page vibe going on.The only complaint I have about this disc is the band's vocalist. He takes a very throaty (as opposed to gutteral) approach to tough guy growling, and sounds very fake in my humble opinion. But, the vocalist quit anyway, so it's alright I guess."
1,5 stars to the previous reviewer,"I'm up all buzzed and stuff and I just want to say that calling disturbed and staind fake metal is one of the mose righteous things I've seen in this Amazon review zone. right on man, right on."
5,Terrific Jewish songs for kids and parents,"I will admit that I listen to this CD in my car even without the kids! Beautiful harmonies, very accessible, I have had it for 5 years and am STILL listening!"
4,More Bear adventures!,"This won't be an in depth review, so I'll keep this short. And this won't be much of a review of Bear Grylls as an expert on surviving in the wild. But, I will say these 10 adventures are entertaining, and it shows us parts of the world that aren't too explored....television wise, that is.Also, there ARE English subtitles for this season. So, to anybody complaining about the lack of subtitles/closed captions on previous seasons, Discovery does it right with this season. I'm not sure if there are closed captions however, but there are English subtitles only.Another thing, be prepared, like always, for a strong stomach for at least some of these episodes. Some of what he eats is just awful."
4,Doesn't half taste good,"I definitely enjoyed the season. I was hoping that the episode with Will Farrell was going to be in it but to my dismay, i will have to wait for the next season. there was a little bit of stagnancy in the situations Bear had to face. a lot of the situations that were left for him didn't pan out as unexpected. must say that the bee-sting in the face on the salt pans was a test of endurance. made it through just as the WILDMAN always does. this season is definitely a good addition to the collection."
1,Bear is a fake,"First of all, he has his own camera crew... secondly... the first thing he does when he gets in the wild is search for food... It's sooo fake! And he DOES NOT sleep outside at night. He goes back to the hotel. That is a known fact. I would not waste my money on any of his stuff!"
5,I love Jeff Bridges,This has to be one of my favorite movies of Jeff Bridges. It is also a great racing movie. I give this film a 10 out of 10.
2,The Last American Hero (hard driver),"Not the actual movie I was looking for, but an ok 70s flick. It was a good 'B' flick. Seemed drawn out though."
3,A car movie,"Jeff Bridges is a likable actor, and likable in this movie. I don't think it was a stand out performance, but as I collect DVD's that have car racing, chasing, crashing, and the like .... I needed to add it to my collection, and it was a nice addition. If you like Jeff Bridges .... and auto racing, car chasing, and auto sports, it's a fun movie.The bonus, was Valerie Perrine. Not the greatest part for her, but she can always attract me to buy an inexpensive film, with her in it. She was so hot! Playboy nude or not .... she while not the greatest actress of all time, in my opinion was one of the most attractive .... and she did an adequate job in this role.Overall, not Jeff Bridges best, but with Valerie Perrine, and lots of cars chasing around .... it is an enjoyable flick."
4,the last american hero,"Being a nascar fan I had pleasure following the career and familiar ways of the ""hero""..."
3,A hope to get the movie,"Had hoped to get a copy of this somewhat classic movie, but it was sent in dvd zone 1 format and zone 2 was not available. However I was not charged for the item."
2,Marf Droppings........,"That's what this book is. in case you are wondering, marfs are crocodile like beasts in this book. Anywhoo the plot is actually a good one in this book, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. The HEA ending fell flat, but I will say the heroine in the book is a good solid, strong female character. But, Erotica this is not. The euphemisms in this book for womens parts are not good: 'tender thorn'/WTH??? One reviewer says this is 'prose'- I don't think so.All these good reviews MUST be the authors friends, but GOOD friends should be honest..................."
4,Provocative,"The highlight of this book is chapter 9 as he discusses ontology, i.e., the nature of what truly exists. He talks about the present as always changing into the past and the future. In other words, the present isn't really present. To illustrate how change occurs he mentions a piece of meat as it is cooking. If left unattended, when will the meat cease to be meat?In places he gets bogged down in jargon and complexity. He starts by discussing education in general, noting that in addition to English, a student should study French and Latin, that certain things can only be known though the original tongue of the author. Overall this is an insightful collection of essays."
1,"With shipping, price doubles","I was going to purchase this wax. But when I went to check out, the $15 purchase price nearly doubled because shipping and handling was nearly $12. Not my idea of truth-in-pricing."
5,Easiest Install,"Eveything was easy, pretty much plug, n play and your good to go, all bose speakers, sub, tweeters, good to go, highly recommended!"
2,Backpacking for the Obsessive/Compulsive,"While this book has a few good tips it can't make up for the irritating tone of the author. This book takes a very simple activity and turns it into an obsessive pursuit. Get a copy of Collin Fletcher's ""Complete Walker III"" and learn to create your own style instead of having it force fed to you. While lightening the pack is always a good idea for enjoying the outdoors there are safer ways to do it than are outlined in this book. Plain and simple, I just didn't like the book."
1,hippy dippy blowhard,"Ray approaches ""the ultralight philosophy"" like a recovering alcoholic preaching about the evils of ""demon rum"". The one thing all these ultralight writers have in common is they once carried ridiculous loads like sherpas, and finally saw the light. Who was ever that idiotic? Most of us figured out long ago that lighter is better, and I've never seen anyone outside of a paratrooper carry 60 plus lb. loads. He reminds me of a kid I knew in 5th grade that maintained he invented the word (insert common racial epithet).Jardine brings nothing new to backpacking, except for the digusting habit of hiking in biking shorts. For the most part his book consists common sense tips on lessening the load, interspersed with egomaniacal psuedo-spiritual diatribes. Other highlights include some incredibly stupid thoughts on giardia, mosquitos and food.Save your money, buy Colin Fletcher's book. He's a good writer first, backpacking guru second."
1,I can't believe I wasted my money on this,"After hearing of Ray Jardine's hiking exploits (AT, PCT, CDT), I decided spring for his book. This book is full of Ray Jardine's personal opinions that are packaged as ""facts"". In particular, his outright slander against all commerical food borders on the absurd, and he provides no evidence for most of it, other than referencing some obscure books by guys who probably wear tinfoil hats. And, the Ray Way is apparently the only way to hike (so says Ray).Don't waste your time or money. There are far better guides out there that cover lightweight backpacking."
1,Do it your way!,"Condescendance and a zealous behavior are not the way to present something different. Though Mr.Jardine displays a few practical ideas, his tone and manner are quite disturbing in this book.... Sure, I can see in a few instances where his practices would benefit a long distance hiker, but recent general concensus from Backpacker magazine has concluded that the vast majority of backpackers are uninterested in Jardine's obsessive approach. Nevertheless, there are a few that revel in his ways and it's safe to say many of these people take greater pleasure in obsessing over pack weight than actually being out in the wilderness."
1,Waste of trees,"Soon after starting I found myself paging ahead in hopes of finding something worthwhile for my backpacking quite soon i was at the end: i got up and threw the book in the trash; I NEVER throw books in the trash..........A pointless waste of innocent trees, living things died to make the paper for this, sad, very sad.Vacuous opinion, little to no useful advice. Buy Fletcher or another, but anyway choose an author that actually wants to help rather than merely pontificate emptily."
2,Idealism gone afar,"Though I did find some useful practices in Mr.Jardines book, I find this man to have a personality like a religious cult leader. He presents his ideas and beliefs as though they are scripture and that we are the flock of sheep(mindless followers) he seeks control of. Remember: backpacking is a very simple activity, not a race to finish the fastest or most efficiently, we have enough of that in society. After all, anyone with common sense knows a lighter pack is easier on the back. I do agree with Jardine's point of people falling into the marketing traps of gear makers. So in that regard I feel the book is worth reading if your looking to shed a few pounds by making your own gear. Aside from that, Collin Fletcher's ""Complete Walker III"" is a nonzealous, practical and the most informative book to backpacking I've read."
3,Light weight backpacking guide,"This book is in large part outdated from the available commercial equipment point of view.However the book is very well organized and very well written, regardless howopinionated it is.The material is written for a chronic light (no) weight fanatic, not an enthusiast.I am an advocate for light weight bacpacking, in most part because I am getting older, but without crossing into the field of being anal about it. The appropriate title of this book should be ""Beyond Minimalism in backpacking""."
3,Idealism cycling through,"Though many of Mr. Jardine's ideas are effective to an experienced backpacker, his in you face elitist mentality is a bit abrasive to conventional backpacking practice. No doubt, a lighter house on the back makes a more enjoyable experience, but when he presents it in an arrogant and scriptural like manner it gives me the feeling he covets to become some revolutionary leader. Though his approach and accomplishments are efficiency based, he by no means is the founder of lightweight backpacking as he slyly insinuates through the book. People with common sense from the begining of time have known ""simple and light"" makes easier travel. He clearly saw a controversial topic and capitalized with a zealot approach. Hitting the multi-million dollar backpacking industry nerve was just too easy, considering the sheep had followed it all too long. Nevertheless, it's worth reading, but use common sense when applying ""Ray's Way""."
5,A wonderful companion to the DVD.,"This extraordinary book on the last hundred years American cinema is an exceptionally well written, edited and researched document of the film, without any of the usual scholarly classroom didactics or conceited Hollywood self-congratulatory posturing. Scorsese's humble voice is evident throughout, and it is one of self-confidence, clarity and enthusiasm. The book is a wonderful companion to the DVD."
2,It's kind of corny,"I was reading it to find out some tips, yet it was a corny book. I didn't like it."
2,HUGE dissapointment,"I wanted a reasonably priced CZ princess stud earring that wouldn't turn my ear green. Eve's Addiction products are dependable and durable, but they were HUGE. I mean almost 2 carats each. They should really specify the size because i wouldn't of thought they would be so over-the-top big. So now they'll be costume jewelry or given away."
3,Still pretty convincing...,"This DVD may present a more skeptical view of Noah's Ark, but it still creates a fantasy world of possibility where mystery is more important than fact and satellite imagery only shows what we think might exist. People love mystery and hope is always present. I think this DVD is actually more interesting from that perspective and there are some ideas for how a worldwide flood could have occurred. Fossils are shown and if you enjoy reading biblical accounts, a story is played out to give you a sense of how long it would have actually taken to build such a large vessel. Tests are employed to see if such a vessel would sink under extreme conditions and the problems of how the animals could have been cared for is also addressed. Many different people, from archeologists to those who claim first-hand knowledge and sightings are interviewed. This is a good introduction to the mystery of the Ark if you are fascinated by this topic.~The Rebecca Review"
3,Not an accurate reflection,This movie was put together well however it is not at all an accurate reflection of the bible or events of Noah's life. I was disappointed in that aspect. I did like the injection of comedy in this story. I would not recommend this if you want something that mirrors the bible.
3,Wrong Mountian?,"They were looking on the wrong mountain; the one referred to in Genesis is in modern Armenia, not Turkey. Other than that it was enjoyable entertainment."
1,Dissapointed !!!!!!,"Very disappointed, I was looking for a Movie type story.This was more a Documentary with photo's.I wasted money on this, but am still looking for theReal ""Played out"" Movie type.I know it's out there,it was on a tv ,movie channel,not to long ago. If anyone knows,where it is,or where tofind it,Please post it on here. OK."
2,Hasty,"i'm going to ignore the Korngold here, as i don't particularly care for him, but mostly just a short note on the Tchaikovsky VC..why does it have to be so hasty? i know it's a bit of a crude statement, but i've always appreciated the slower, more luxurious feel of her earlier recording of this and was hoping to hear something similar, as i lost that cd a while ago, but this is just.. rushed.. as everything these days seems to be.. from beethoven symphonies to working..Everything must be done quickly, and this recording seems to follow suit.Is this because the age of the 'romantic' conductors has come to a close, and the new generation has to do something else to be ""original""?No, i can't say this recording did it for me at all..oh well, there's always her von Karajan recording"
4,Everything I expected,"I heard that this movie was in production a while ago, checked back in on it a few times, then forgot. Then to my surprise saw it in a friends DVD collection today and gave it a watch.Pretty surreal at times, sort of attention grabbing. Theres some really interesting characters, the ending is sort of cliche, but all in all worth the hour and a half of my life spent watching it.Probably going to watch it again later (and I don't do that often) but yeah, the characters could have had a little more development. Usually I love Steve Buscemi, but I wasn't really that into him in this flick. Hes not a main character though, so I guess he did a great job in not being too attention grabbing.Couple absurd moments, feel good ending, will probably buy this DVD and nag others to watch it."
3,Unusual film,For the cast involved I was surprised that this is such a strange movie. Not enough Tim Roth for me. Not a movie I'd watch over and over.
2,Meh...,"2.5 stars, actually.Somehow, this movie is just quirky enough to get you watch it through to the end, and just humdrum enough to make you think of other things you could have done with that time instead."
2,Tony Moran let's me down a bit here...,"Some popular hits (maybe too popular) are broken up by some unimpressive filler. Nothing in the way of exclusive or hard-to-find remixes, no hidden gems of peak hour vocal anthems, and the mixes are all relatively short. Track times:1. I want you for myself (4:30)2. Nanga (4:05)3. Irresistible (4:18)4. pressure cooker (4:42)5. Don't leave me this way (5:53)6. That look (6:22)7. muzikum (5:52)8. the hum melody (5:36)9. die another day (5:26)10. dark beat (5:49)11. I don't want you (7:50)12. if you love me (6:58)13. snake charmer (4:40)14. let it go (5:59)"
3,Rare Find,"This, as far as I can find, is the only combined recording of all six serenades of op. 104(duos 1,2,3) and 109 (duos 4,5,6)This alone makes it rare but that it is out of print and unavailable altogether makes it extremely rare. It is definitely worth owning if it could be owned. I'm glad I was able (with some trouble) to get a copy years ago."
3,"Good enough for the price, but . . .","As the other reviewers have commented, the handle design is poor. It does not attach well to the mower, resulting in a flimsly operation with the lower handle frequently detaching from the base. As others have done, I performed my own ""fix,"" drilling holes and affixing the handle properly. The Briggs & Stratton Engine started easily and ran smoothly. The engine is designed to run at a constant speed and cannot be changed on the fly. The front wheel drive does not have a solid feel and is only a single speed. It works well enough, though. I have only used this on the ""mulch"" configuration and the cut was very decent without much visible residue. This is not a high end mower and should not be named ""Pro."" It's good enough for the price (when on a decent sale) and Briggs & Stratton did their fair share on the motor, but Poulan could have made a more solid machine."
4,quality for the price,this is a great mower and practical. no complaints on the moweronly problem was the shipping. the packaging is poor and ups had to repack the mowercheck thourghly the package contents when recieved
2,Never Received a New Machine!,"The first machine I received, within one minute of using it the part that controls the drive fell out. Amazon was great to exchange it, however they sent me a refurbished machine because the machine was delivered and it had oil in the tank. The oil leaked inside the box. So, I think it needs to be clear that are not buying a new machine but a used or refurbished."
4,By the Fire Holiday Music,This CD has nice calm holiday music fit for listening by a crackling fire.Beautiful guitar strains take you away to a pleasant place. It is short--so put it on replay. Enjoy.
5,The Definitive Guide to ATL Server,"This is an excellent book on the definitive technology for VC++ developers wanting to write web applications. ATL Server is the evolution of ISAPI; better, faster and much easier to write. If you are comfortable with C++ template programming and attributed Visual C++, you will find this framework a joy to work with. Just like ATL, ATL Server is streamlined, high performance and easy to extend.Written by the ATL Server team, this book will guide you through the different parts of ATL Server, giving you not only reasons for why certain design decisions were made but also real-world examples."
5,masterpiece,Its why they call it Masterpiece. Its perfect! Who knew Oxford was such a dangerous place? And its free with Prime!
5,So good and in Blu-ray,"Treated myself and happy are the results.Other posts have spoilers so readers should go there.More Lewis please, don't stop the series. Always full of surprises, excellent cinemaphotography and sound, music right on for the moments, characters unique, plots so unique.Such a very long tradition going back to the first Morse so many years ago."
3,Review of The Dead of Winter,"Although I am a fan of British detective films, I can't seem to forget that Lewis played well as a bumbling sergeant to Inspector Morse, whom Morse constantly needed to berate, and, perhaps, this is why I see him now in his new role as a somewhat placid, not altogether bright Inspector in this series. The existence of his sidekick Sergeant Hathaway, who seems bright, adds to this impression. This episode begins with the discovery of a body of a man whose head was beat in with a blunt object. Lewis and Hathaway have to figure out how he got on a bus when he was killed some distance away in a church. The film has several murders, several improper sexual behaviors, a missing woman, and discord between Lewis and Hathaway."
5,Inspector Lewis Masterpiece Mystery collection,"I now have all the Inspector Lewis collection bought with Amazon. They are of the very few CD's that I like to watch more than once. The three main actors are great and the plots are never just simple dective stories. I also enjoy seeing the beautiful campus scenes and the elegant and traditional banquets and manners. Beverley Blount Owner Director Christa McAuliffe Montessori Schools, Mexico City"
5,Excellent,I personally enjoy the story writing but this is another fantastic season between Lewis and Hathaway on there efforts to clean up the town. They have so many different twists but the cinematography is topps
4,Beautiful British Countryside and Crime,"If you enjoy Midsomer Murders, you will probably like this series. I am hoping to see Inspector Morse which is where Lewis started."
5,Inspector Lewis 4,Season 4 is wonderful! The writing continues to be superb and will keep you guessing until the very end of the episode.
1,Tedious and contrived,"The first episode in this season is among the worst that they've produced. Tedious, contrived, and B-O-R-I-N-G. The writers seem to have lost their edge. Inspector Lewis deserves better."
5,Nice detective work,Maybe should have been only four stars; but only when compared to 'Inspector Morse'. Perhaps an overabundance of deaths in most episodes but usually nothing too gory except in the telling. The combination of the erudite Hathaway and the journeyman Lewis is fascinating. As always real acting is always refreshing and entertainig.
5,TR review,Great service. I would not hesitate doing business with this seller again. Absolutely first rate service!!
2,An advertisement for 1-800-wedding,"This ""planner"" has more advertisements for 1-800-wedding's financial services and other vendors' products and services, and less helpful information than most of the other planning books that I've seen. The questions that are listed for various vendors are helpful, but are also available in most other wedding planning books. Compared to other books, this was a waste of my money."
2,Not a high quality bag,"I sent this bag back the second day. When closing the bag my cornet barely fit inside and the zipper around the edge was so tight that I was afraid it would start bending the bell. It also had no hole for a mouthpiece inside (let alone a second mouthpiece). This is a really good idea for a bag with the shoulder strap but Gator should have invested some more thought and quality into it. Sadly, my old school semi-beat-up student style hard case does a better job than this and that's why I sent it right back."
5,FOGARATE!! love it but how come this CD is not sold anymore?,FOGARATE!!! Amazon please bring this album to your online catalogue. I was a teen when this album came it and I had a blast dancing these bachata songs in the 90s good old memories
5,The Real Deal.,This is the best band of this kind of genre that exists today. The Misfits were great but they have since turned to dust. We will always have their records. But its up to bands that are still around to carry the torch like Groovie Ghoulies and Blitzkid. This cd is great. As a horror fan I totally dig all the songs on this cd. Hellraiser and Candyman are bad ass and you can tell that Blitzkid are horror fans too. Dying Day and These Walls too...Its all good. I'm not going to review Traces of a Stranger b/c its just as good as this one in all the same ways. Melodic Punk Rock with drop D guitars. The best 30 minutes you'll get listening to music. enjoy
1,The Horror Continues!,"Aargh,I made the mistake of ordering this along with Trace of a Stranger without listening to em' first. This one is slightly more listenable due to the afformentioned a.f.i. element being less noticable. More songs about lame 80's horror films. Candyman?!?!? These guy's score some more annoy points by not knowing whether they want to be a metal band or a pop-punk band. I'm open to alot of different music but this closes the door on blitzkid for me. Buy The Misfits:Satic Age, The Cramps:Songs the Lord Taught Us or T.S.O.L.'s:Dance With Me instead!"
3,Bowls don't travel well,After trying 2 times to get these shipped to me I decided to forgoe the shipping and find something else. Two of the three bowls would make the trip but one was always broken. They were beatiful and felt very good in the hands. I wish I could have gotten tnem all here at once without being broken.
4,"Good season, not the best DVD transfer","My comments are about the DVD transfer, not the show itself. A warning to anyone who does not know the winner: don't read the back of the package! As another reviewer commented, they don't come right out and tell you who won, but you can figure it out pretty quickly. The editing for DVD seemed far more sloppy this time as well, especially at commercial breaks where you get to hear Heidi say the exact same thing before and after the cut. There are also far fewer extras than in previous seasons."
4,Wheres the fashion tryouts?,"I purchased this season, hoping that it would be like 1,2,3... They didn't put in the fashion tryouts, I was hoping to see the people trying out for the show, and seeing some of last seasons, big-wigs.. coming back.. That is the only down side to this season... Please Project Runway peoples.. don't leave this out of your DVD's there is a lot of people out there like me that enjoy that part of it!Holly"
1,You get what you pay for,"I ordered my copy from Bottom Line Logistics. I only paid $9.99 and what I got were for CDs in the mail, no box, not even not the regular CD box with Klum on the cover, I mean NO BOX. Just 4 CDs. Haven't watched them yet, but . . ."
5,The Night Shift... great company,The Night Shift was one of my favorites on TV... I'm glad that i now own the entire first season on DVD. It's great company for a General Hospital fan. The storyline is not based on the show... but includes some of the same characters which is good. I like though that they interlope it at the end.
5,i enjoyed watching NS but hate what they did to my faves,"I have given GH's Night Shift Five stars because i love the characters,Patrick and Robin . I dislike how poorly they were written and how their characters acted. But I Love GH and I did enjoy watching NS just to see what the heck was going to happen next and i really want to see a season 2 ( hopefully) they will learn from season 1 and finally give my couple a good storyline. I also enjoyed the storylines of Lainey/Cody and Kelly and the hunky anetheisologist. i couldn't stand the three student nurses (especially the Leyla character) but I hope for better character development and better storys for the future. But I truthfully have to say even though i disliked what they did to Patrick/Robin I liked the fact that there was a spin off to GH with them in it and that it was their own show."
1,Say No to the Night Shift,"I went in so excited for this show, that was supposed to revolve around my favorite daytime couple, Patrick Drake and Robin Scropio, but was instantly dissappointed. It depicted them as totally different character and the story change half way through was a disasterious idea. The forced pairing of ""nurse"" Leyla and Patrick was nausiating and lacking in any chemistry. It was so horrible i stopped watching after acouple episodes."
1,Guza's folly,"After being billed as a show case for the Patrick and Robin characters, this series completely trashed the character of Patrick, gave us the chemistry black hole that is Patrick and Leyla (an abomination that bled over to GH, unfortunately) and was generally a kick in the teeth to fans. NO WAY would I buy this. Its only due to the overall awesomeness of Jason Thompson and Kimberly McCullough that this couple was not ruined beyond the point of repair."
1,Terrible waste of money,"Please save your money! This series was horribly written, and the production quality is that of an amateur. The writers could have taken some pointers from online fanfiction authors. I am embarrassed for those involved with this show. I wouldn't waste my money!"
1,Stick to GH,"If you are interested in Night Shift because you love General Hospital, you should probably just stick with General Hospital. I wish I didn't have the Night Shift stories clouding my brain. Some of the stories were acknowledged on GH (the Killer Nurse and her sister, Nadine). Others were not acknowledged and were actually impossible on GH at the time (Maxie needs heart procedure, Jason performing community service while he was in prison on GH...). See other reviews for the Jason/Robin issues. The only thing worth seeing the series for is the CG skyline. Who knew Port Charles was SO big (skyscrapers, etc.), considering how quickly people walk from place to place?"
2,I CAN'T STAND IT BEYOND DISAPPOINTMENT !,"I have to send it off to a friend, that likes it , General Hospital shouldn't even be on it ! it leaves alot to be desired!The Charge nurse is a disgrace, The Dr, that thinks he knows everything, needs to go somewhere and think about how to act , he was a loud mouth ass in Rocky 5 and he is a jerk in Night shift! Now why in the blue blazes, would you put someone like Billy Dee as a clean up man ? The person that was the Charge Dr, should be Billy Dee's role and the one that was a jerk should be cleaning! The one you chose for charge nurse needs to be in Security. She has got a loud enough mouth! I didn't want to see Robin in the shower! She played back up in General hospital, she should of stayed that way, Too many new faces! The only good thing that happened was the bomb! VERY DISAPPOINTED!My Son could do better and he is 16! No wonder it didn't last, I wast'ed my money!............peace Georgette"
4,School Book Report,We purchased the book so my son could finish a summer reading report for school. The library didn't have enough copies for the students and it was hard to get it completed in a short amount of time. Renewals were not possible. It accomplished the task we had.
3,It is a book full of facts which makes it kind of boring.,The book was informative and it got the point acorss but it was a bit boring.
3,Black Like Me,This book was very monotonous. After awhile it was the same thing over and over. I liked the idea more than the book. It just wasn't very interesting. I think it would have been better if they'd made the whole story up. It tells you the things you already know. It's just a black man walking around doing nothing interesting.But it is classic. So I suppose you should read it whether you want to or not.
4,Great Book,This book was very informational on how the race situation was in the south during the late 50's. It was a real eye opener into the emotional side of racism back then. The book was important in that it really showed both sides of the story. One of the weak points of the book was when he started to struggle with not being emotionally attached. Also towards the end it got really repetitive and boring. The strengths of the book was how well researched and accurate it was on both sides. I think that every one should read this book. Whether or not you have racial prejudices or not it was a great read and look into our not so distant past. It also is a very good example of how words and actions can effect people.
4,Pretty Good,"I feel like ive read nearly every book there is on racism. It is rare for me to feel as if ive read something of that nature with a new angle, but this book suprised me. What I love is that Griffin writes with little to no favortism, the style is very objective. A minor classic."
5,oh wow this is unforgettable!,"This book was recommended to me, and i bought it and it sat on my shelf for a time. I got it down the other day and started reading and could not put it down. It was amazing.I was brought back to so many memories of the deep south and the attitudes, (that still are now today) prevailing in that time.I admire this man's courage so much. I despaired at the attitudes the white people had tword him. The look, the tone of voice, the lonliness.When he looks into the mirror for the first time, he is greeted by, himself yet a stranger.To walk in another man's shoes is indeed a gift of God, and to be able to have compassion for that experiance is great.This will be one of my fave. books along with Watership Down and several others i have read over and over again.This would be a book you could read over again and get more and more from.Amazing book."
4,Lost in everyone...,"It's sad that we are not requiring this as a summer read to be discussed when high school evaporates the pools and even sadder that it exists as only a blip in some required psychology class. John didn't become black. He was black. He did get the ""hate-stare.""This is an excellent example of when everyone gets lost in everyone."
4,Courageous!,"This man is a real pioneer! He ventured into the unknown,at a time and place where anything could've happened! Even altering his skin tone,not really knowing if it was going to be reversible or not! Have we learned anything out of this? Will we ever? I read this once while in high school,and again 28 years later....Riveting,poignant,bold.........dare to read it!!"
5,"A life changing, eye-opening observation of U.S. racism","I read this book for the first time as a teenager in the 70's. As a young white boy living in the south, I don't think it would have been possible to come close to understanding the fear and hatred that blacks experienced on a daily basis without this man's book bringing it to life for me. For those who have made racial comments of hatred concerning this great work, I (and many others) can simply pity their ignorance and pray that God will grant them the enlightenment that could change their lives forever. I recommend this book to people of all color."
5,My insight for the first 60 pages of the book,"The intro of this book was quite slow, but the pace started getting faster as it got into the experiment and the problems got harder for this author. It is so realistic how this is the only way to learn about another race. That is if you actually become the race."
3,Interesting,"This book gives a reminder look at civil rights history.It is amazing that the author was able to ""pull off"" his unusual experiment."
3,Knowledgeable and Moving,"Nobody can deny the social importance of Griffin's novel Black Like Me. Nobody can deny that it is priceless, a first-hand historical account of what it's like being black in the Deep South--by an outsider, a white man turned black by artificial and deliberate means. This book is about suffering, so I cannot say that I enjoyed it. I am, however, glad that I read it. The major downfall, however, is that it is in diary form at not as poignant and moving as it could have been."
3,Sad that it's true,"This book was hard to get into. I was surprised at the difference in how people treated him when he was white vs. when he was black. I think it is so sad that racism is still alive. I know we don't live in a perfect world, but I just don't understand how people can continue to treat certain people with less respect only on the basis of skin color.This book was recommended to me by a professor from my graduate program. I think everyone would benefit from reading this book and taking time to reflect on your own beliefs, attitudes, and actions."
3,Good Book,"This book was very compelling read, it really helped me understand what it was like to be black in the 50's. Anyone who has difficulty understanding how the black race was treated needs to read this book because it is wonderful and very accurate in telling of how people were treated in that time. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone!"
4,How Far Have We Come?,"Many years ago, as owner of a bookstore, I added this title to my inventory and of course read it. Growing up in Wyoming we saw no Negroes so the book was an eye-opener. I was aware of the discrimination and had strong feelings about it but no experience. As I look around at our society now, I wonder that we have come from that mindset to the election of President Obama. I applaud the courageous beings who have pushed for the betterment of all mankind. Black Like Me will certainly bring up emotions and maybe give some insight to how it was and how it really is improving even though it doesn't seem like it sometimes. My husband is now reading the book and I can hardly wait to hear what he thinks about it! I would certainly recommend it."
5,Very Interesting...,"I have never heard of this book but when telling others that I was reading it, it seemed like I was the only one on the planet who didn't know anything about this author. I would have loved to have seen him in person in both black and white. The book was a page turner and I really respected his views. I always respect a person who doesn't write books off of statistics and will go out of his way for personal experience...and ma-an, did he go out of his way!"
5,A Great American Classic,"I am amazed how much has changed since Mr. Griffin did this experiment , & yet so much has stayed the same ! I live in a ""rust belt"" city , & white , ignorant , un-educated people still think they're superior to the black population ! It just baffles me ?? The book itself was fast reading , you could taste the food , smell the odors , ""see"" New Orleans as if you were there ! A sad commentary on the times , but it was a start.............Mr. Griffin is a true American hero , anyone seeking out the truth as he did is..........even if you fail , at least you tried , that's how this book makes me feel , I WILL try , never say die , very profound effect on my life.....read the book , you won't be disappointed ! Don ""G"""
4,Black Like Me,"The book I read was called Black Like Me, By John Howard Griffin. This book is about a white, middle aged man who darkened his skin. He wanted to see what it was really like to be a black man in the Deep South. So he is basically under cover going to experience the treatment and life of a black man in the Deep South.To me this book was pretty good. The only bad part about this book was in the begining it was kind of confusion, because they were talking about how the plan was going to work, and it was kind of hard to understand.My recommendation for this book would be to peole who like to learn about history and how things were back then. If you are a person who doesn't know much about how things were in those rasis days, then this is a book for you."
5,Brave,"I read this book a while ago. But even now, I still remember how good of a read it was. Griffins way of showing how it is to be black in those days was a major leap in trust. Not many well-liked white men would dress up as a black man to show the injustice in america. I would have a hard time changing my skin color to become a black man. I think that showing the injustice was just as scary as almost anything you could imagine. Throwing yourself into a world that might kill you, and all the while gathering information to show the rest of the world was daring and gutsy. I admire Griffin for his ability to do that. The plot was a gripping one that kept me reading and wanting to know what was goint to happen next. I would recommend this book to anyone."
5,Black,Outstanding book. Recommend it be read by all citizens including Yankees and Southeners. Book had yellowed some but otherwise was perfectly readable.
5,This book is AMAZING,"To really, honestly, see the world through another person's eyes is something that's incredibely rare and is difficult to do. Griffin darkened his skin and changed his life to be able to see what it was really like being a black man in the segregated South. The things he heard, felt, and saw are things that will forever be impressed upon my mind as a reader. The way he told his story was very simple and straightforward, which almost seems to bring the messages home even harder. You can easily see him struggling with concepts that were everyday for the people he encountered: segregated restrooms, segregated water fountains, sneering, baiting, hatred, and disdain. If this book doesn't make you want to cry, then you don't have a pulse."
4,A compelling story about the cruelty of our human nature,"How far would you go in order to see life from another person's perspective? Of course all of us would change if it meant that we would have a better life, but how many of us would put ourselves in a new lifestyle that would station us at the bottom of the social and economic system? John Howard, the author of Black Like Me, did just this. He found a way to change his skin pigmentation so that it was dark. He went down to the deep south during the late 1950's. This was a time of great oppression, humiliation, and segregation of colored people. This book follows his life before, after and during his life changing activities. We see people who are sympathetic to blacks and we see people who are ready to kill every last colored person alive. This book was truly moving and yet it was saddening. I suggest this book to anyone who thinks they have a grip on reality, because this book is sure to shake them up a little bit."
2,Answers are extra,"The book is good, but certainly not up to the other reviews I read. Surprisingly, it's purportedly used as a school text. That's surprising because there's absolutely NO theory inside this tome. It's strictly network by rote.Especially frustrating were the Exercises and Case Studies *without answers*. Want answers? That's extra-$19.95 for the CD _after_ sending the publisher a ""legal release form"".My advice-get a serious text, with extensive explanations (not just lists), good, tough questions and the answers in the back (right where they belong)."
2,Old stuff,"I bought this DVD a couple of weeks ago in Luxemburg in a store as a special bargain, but i have to say that it really wasn't worth the money. All crashes are known to everyone that watches car reaces on tv. Nothing special,only old stuff."
5,"Simple, Safe and Secure",This device is awesome. Lost my cellphone once and the 700 contacts in it!!! NIGHTMARE!!! Never again. This thing is SO simple and if I'm on the road and add new contacts I can back them up without the need for a computer. This is the greatest favor you could do for yourself or someone you love.
2,Not so great,"I thought from the description that this would interface with my Outlook contacts, but it doesn't. Just allows you to fill in the boxes on your PC. Probably a little better than using your phone, but not much."
1,Didn't laugh,"Gave up at minute 43 (under halfway thru). Wanted very badly to laugh but didn't. Didn't even smirk.Cuts to the audience didn't show much laughter - suspect that what there was was polite laughter because the cast was trying hard.Reminded me of skits back in my college days where people thought it was enough that they found the subject humorous, but failed to show the humor in the situation."
1,Unbelievably Vapid and Inane,"Amazon needs to find a way to allow reviewers to rate a product with negative stars -- if only for the sake of Embedded Live, a work whose psuedo-intellectual pretension is only outdone by its utter lack of artistic merit (indeed, to use the word ""merit"" in connection with this ""product"" is to devalue the word).I imagine Mr. Robbins thinks that because he can read headlines from the NY Times that he has the credentials to speak of Leo Strauss and his political philosophy. One need only have a passing familiarity with the works of Strauss to know that Robbins's understanding of the man and his ideas is as misconceived and misdirected as Mr. Robbins's artistic abilities -- which is nil.My only consolation after experiencing this unbelievably vapid and inane product is that this play, as well as the ideas (such as they are) behind it, will soon be as dated and irrelevant as Mr. Robbins's acting career itself."
4,Good Quality Made in USA But Does Not Fit,"Upper hose, nope. I entered my car info correctly and the website says this will fit but it is nothing like the upper radiator hose on my 1990 BMW 535i. UPDATE: This is actually the LOWER hose.Gates is good, made in the USA quality so I am glad that at least one hose from this order is the correct one for my car."
4,great stuff!,"Man, this made hot tub cleaning easy and made it look like new! Definatly recommend! great stuff! Best Price and fast service!"
3,good recipes,"I chose a 3 rating because I liked the book and gave it as a gift, but was disappointed that it had NO pictures of the finished products."
5,A Consistent Go To!,"I purchased this cookbook for my husband (who is from Finland) a few years ago and we use it all of the time - in fact it doesn't go back in the cabinet with the majority of my other cookbooks (I'm a cookbook addict!).What I love about this book is the stories and explanations before so many of the AUTHENTIC recipes. I feel a little closer to my husband and his culture after reading the recipes and stories and then tasting the dishes too! And the ""flat bread"" is so unbelievably easy and delicious there is no excuse for not having fresh bread at any time!"
2,Pretentiously pretending,"To think there was a time when I equated Stewart's pretentious moaning with emotional sincerity and the band's clunky compositions as unhinged indie makes me sadder than hearing poor Chapman's ""Fast Car"" butchered past exploitation."
5,No One Should Follow Blindly,"I am one who has followed blindly and this book sure opened my eyes. It is well written. Dr. Koren sites all of his sources and also has a list at the back of other books on this subject. He also talks about how vaccinations are voted in and it is practically a conspiracy! His book was written in 2000 and so it is up to date and current. It is also easy to read and follow, not a lot of huge words that no one understands. GREAT and EASY read!!!"
4,All parents should know this!,"Dr. Koren's book does an excellent job of educating parents about the truth of the vaccination hoax which has been perpetuated by the medical and pharmaceutical companies on the public. All parents deserve to know the truth about vaccinations, before forcing their children to submit to these unproven toxic substances."
2,"Some good info, but poorly written","As someone who has done a lot of reading and learning related to vaccines, I found this book to have some good info, but it was presented poorly. Many things are just brushed on the surface and not explained well enough and it seems to jump from one thought to another without connecting the dots. Not a good book for people looking to explore the ""other side"" of vaccination."
3,Beatiful singing - but where are the Swedish texts?,"This is an excellent collection, the best available overview of a great tenor.This would get 4 stars but has been marked down for only supplying token texts and translations in the large booklet. It is understandable (sort of) that the Italian opera excerpts don't merit texts and translations as (apart from the Callas recitals series) EMI generally doesn't provide texts with historical issues. However the tempting inclusion of a dozen or so texts to the Italian and Swedish songs makes one all the more aware of the miserliness of not providing all the texts."
3,Good collection of alto cantatas with some shorter pieces,"Rene Jacobs (counter-tenor) and Akadmie fur alte Musik Berlin. Recorded 1989 in coproduction with the then East German label VEB Deutsche Schallplatten.The main works on this disk are the secular cantata ""Tirsis am Scheideweg"" [20'07""] and two church cantatas ""Nach Finsternis und Todesschatten"" [10'58""] ""Meines Bleibens ist nicht hier"" [13'15""]. Total 59'56"". Full texts and Translations."
1,Not very helpful,"The CD with this book has one speaker that sounds exactly like Peggy Hill (King of the Hill). A male, probably native speaker, speaks so fast you would have to be pretty fluent to repeat what he says. I agree with the other reviewer: save your money."
1,very general book,if you are looking for a very very very basic book its good. i didnt think it was comprehensive. I am in dental school and i was looking for more detailed descriptions.
3,Not bad...,"This film kind of had a made for tv feel about it. It was okay but needed a little more meat to it-seemed like it was somewhat contrived-even though it is based on a true story. Good performance by Bernie Casey and a very good performance by the late Ron O'Neal considering what little he had to work with-unfortunately his part in the film isn't long enough. After his departure from the film one misses him, and the film loses some energy. Music by Taj Mahal is depressive but in keeping with the film's theme."
3,Some good stuff here - Some is total nonsense!,"Robert Harley is a ""high-end audiophile"" and you need to keep that in mind when reading thru any of his books. In ""Home Theater For Everyone"", he provides a lot of useful information. But he also supplies a lot of ""hokum"" as well. That is, there is much in this books that he states as fact when infact it is nothing more than his own (often erroneous) opinion.If you are already well-versed in audio/video equipment, you'll know when Mr. Harley goes ""off-the-wall"" with his crazy statements and conclusions. But if you're new to the world of audio/video, I say ""buyer beware"". If you follow all of Mr. Harley's advice, you will end up spending thousands of dollars on overpriced equipment and unnecessary frills.Buy the book for the great general information Mr. Harley provides. But be wary of some of his conclusions and advice. One area where I strongly agree with Mr. Harley is when he advocates to do your own shopping and make your own judgements."
3,nice introduction,"This book is nicely written, I read most of it in 3 nights. However, throughout the book the author discusses THX certification. Coincidentally, the forward is written by the ""inventor of THX"". Conflict of interest? Also, a book revised in 2000 should not include 8 pages on laserdisk. Some details such as distortion and interfaces were not discussed in depth. Otherwise simple and informative."
2,Will date quickly,"These authors were brave trying to write a lasting hardcover on technology that dates faster than sliced bread. Sure, the information is comprehensive and tries to cover all technologies, but in such a general way that those of us with more than a skerick of knowledge will get bored quickly."
2,NOT for Everyone,"I purchased this book as a requirement for a new job. I recently left the practice of law and went to work for a company that designs, sells and installs home theaters. Having graduated from law school, one would think I could understand just about everything. Wrong. This book touts itself as one that is for the masses - the everyday schmo who is looking to do this themselves. While extraordinarily well written, it is NOT for everyone. It is overly complex and technical for the everyday guy and is more apropos for electrical engineers or experts in the field. finally, the issue I received was supposed to be a recent edition and, if it was, it's already painfully out of date and needs revamped."
4,Soft and Comfy!,I love this snuzzler. The cloth is soft and 'skin' friendly. It keeps your baby's head in place.
3,Just O.K.,"I wasn't as satisfied with this product as I thought I'd be. It's really bulky when I used it for my newborn in her bouncy seat, and it really just made her slouch forward more because of the bulkiness. It's like there wasn't enough room for her head! I hardly ever use it, but I will try it again, since it's been a few weeks. It's very soft and I think the idea behind it is good, but I just use my old carseat liner that I bought at a department store."
5,A MUST HAVE!!,This is SO great! It is SO much better then those head rests that they give you with the car seat. Those do nothing but make the baby more uncomfortable! This truly a must have and a great present. I am now pregnant with #4 and buying another one. I wouldn't leave the hospital with my baby without one!
5,A MUST HAVE FOR NEWBORNS,"I received this as a shower gift and can't believe how much I used it. It was perfect in the infant seat, baby swing and bouncer seat. My daughter just looked so content and secure no matter what seat we had her in. She is now 7 mos. so I don't need it in her seats anymore but I do leave it in our car and put it in the highchair when we go out to eat. My only regret is that I didn't buy more than one."
5,Great Purchase- Worth It for Us,"I bought this on sale for my third baby and I wish it had been around when I had my other two children!My infant weighed a nice amount as a newborn and this car seat insert provided him with a lot of cushioning and support even though he was robust. I recently passed it on to a friend with a very small newborn and she raves about how much support it gives her baby as well.This item is easily adjustable and easily can be taken out of the car seat and transferred to a stroller. When my son didn't need as much support in the car seat I kept it in the stroller. It cradled him nicely and kept him warm on cold days.If your baby is average size for a newborn, you will probably use this item for 2-3months, if he/she is smaller then you will need it longer."
5,2nd time mother,I'm making sure I get all the things I should've had the first time and didn't. This is one of them. Very nice product. It makes my Evenflo car seat much more comfy.
4,Works well for infants in outdoor swings,"I bought this to use in our outdoor swing, which is a bit big for our 3-month old. The pillow is great support for her head and prevents her from slipping around on the plastic."
1,Product not recommended for use in car seat,"Warning! This product should not be used in a car seat. The extra padding that is placed behind the child causes more slack between the child and the harness straps. This extra material will compress in a crash, and the child could slip out of the car seat, causing serious injury or even death. It is fine to use the snuzzler in a swing or carrier, but not in a car seat."
4,Didnt get the color I ordered but like the color I received.,The color I ordered wasn't in stock but the terry and cream was and this is nice also. Thank you.
2,Watch out for the Velcro Straps..It bends.,"I don't usually take the time out to write product reviews but I had to for this snuzzler...I was initially happy about the snuzzler..It gave enough support and cushioning ...The problem came when we went for a long trip.My baby was sleeping in this for couple of hours..when we tried to take her out from the car seat,the Velcro of this snuzzler was struck in baby's hair..we couldn't take her out from car seat..we were very tensed,and baby was crying....we made her sit in the car seat,gave her milk,and then tried to take the Velcro strap out of her hair very slowly while she was drinking her milk.....luckily we could take the Velcro out of her hair without much injury to her back of her head..The Velcro straps are not firm ,it bends..So be very careful abt this..."
4,my son likes it,"My 4.5-month-old-son is quite big. He looks like at least a 6-month-old, conservatively speaking. That being said, this works very well for him when we take him for a walk in the back seat of our double stroller. It adjusts to his height and head shape and he has never rolled to the side of the stroller while in use."
5,A MUST HAVE,"This item is a must have!! My baby and I love it and I recommend it to anyone I know having a baby or as a shower gift. It provides the support and cushioning my baby needs to her fragile backside. I can't imagine putting my baby in her car seat without it. It washes nicely and stands up to constance use. It also looks nice, there is a cool side (blue) and a warm side (wool-like)for all weather. I plan on using it in her stroller when she is big enough."
1,disgraceful,"it can give your infant a heat stroke if you are not careful , they should make similar with natural fabric"
1,Voids safety ratings for car seats,"I was told at the hospital to never use any product with a car seat that was not specifically approved by the car seat manufacturer. Their safety tests are based only on the car seat and they cannot make any claims about your baby's safety if they never tested using items such as these.I got one of these for my shower and returned it. I agree it would have been nice to have for my newborn who tended to flop around in the seat for a few weeks, but I wouldn't take the chance."
5,Love this support,This is an outstanding all over support for baby. I have bought one for my baby's car carrier. Now I'm purchasing one for his stroller. I may even get one for his swing too. I love it because it supports the whole body and not just his head. My baby tends to contort himself and this just keeps him more comfortable. I suggest it to anyone and my suggestion is get more than one. You'll want it for everything.
4,Easy to use!!,"Our son was so tiny when we brought him home, but luckily we had a Snuzzler, and he was nice and snug in his carseat and swing. It was so easy, we just pulled the straps under the headpiece and buckled him in! The fleece side was great when it was cold outside, nice and warm. The Snuzzler is well worth the money!"
1,This product is NOT safe for use in carseats,"This is a great product for use in infant swings or bouncy seats, but I wish the labeling was clear that it is not safe to be used with infant carseats. Use of this or similar products with a carseat can make the straps of the seat unacceptably loose."
4,My newborn was too big for this...but great for my neice !!,my baby girl was 10 pounds at birth and did not fix in to this infant body support ...so i gave it to my sister who had a 7pound baby and she fit perfect ...the body support kept her head in place and supported the rest of her body ...the body support is firm but soft very and easy to clean just popit in the washer and dryer
3,Very soft material; offers great support,"This is great for support in a stroller or bouncy seat for a newborn. Love the soft fabric. However the velcro constantly became exposed right below the headrest and would scratch my daughter's neck. If this one design flaw were fixed, maybe with snaps instead, I could highly recommend it. However this one flaw is enough of an issue not to recommend it. I was disappointed as I thought this was the answer to being able to put my daughter directly in the stroller without the carseat. The Boppy headrest from Pottery Barn worked much better for this purpose though not it's not quite as cushy."
4,Perfect in the car seat and the stroller!,"After I received the Snuzzler, I had my doubts about whether or not I would actually use it. I put it in my car seat carrier and my son was snug as a bug. It is a great alternative to head positioners because it not only helps keep the head from slumping over, but also gives the newborn baby the security of being snuggled (which any mom will tell you babies love). I only gave the snuzzler 4 stars because I found that I used it in the car seat for only a short amount of time because my son got too big for it relatively fast. I do, however, use it to this day in the stroller for my 4 month old because he is too little to sit up straight, and it gives the stroller some extra padding."
1,Not good in car seat,"There is a reason not to use this and it is simple, if the unthinkable happens and you are in an accident and your child is injured or god forbid killed you have no recourse whatsoever because you have voided your car seats warranty. All car seat manuals specifically state that the use of ANY after market product, which this is, voids the warranty of the seat. Just something to think about, it doesn't matter if there isn't any padding or anything else, simply by using this product in the car seat you have given up any legal recourse you might have if for some reason the seat fails in an accident even if the snuzzler had nothing to do with it because you voided your warranty and went against the specific instructions in the manual which clearly states not to use any after market products in the seat."
4,Warm & Cozy,"You definitely don't want to use this during the summer months, because your baby will be sweating. I used it during the winter and it worked great for my preemie. The only downfall is that the velco part that attaches the head rest to the body rest is so big and rubs against baby's neck. I had to put a small towel to cover it."
5,Another great product by Kiddopotamus,"This was a necessity for my newborn- in the car seat, the stroller, the swing... it had so many uses, I bought two! It is so nice and soft, helped my colicky baby sleep (he only slept in the car seat or swing), made him feel more secure and snug, and kept his head from hanging at weird angles. He is 11 months old and I still use the pads for the shoulder straps on his car seat to keep his neck from chafing!"
5,Made carseat travel possible,Our daughter hated being in a car seat and car for the first 4 months of her life. I hated everyone who would suggest taking her for a ride to fall asleep bacause every ride was a screamathon for us. Anyway we found the snuzzler when she was about 2 months old. She didn't change her attitude completely but it was definately a marked improvement. I think she felt much more secure in it than she had before with just the infant head rest.
5,Very supportive,"I didn't put this in our car seat for two reasons: I'm not sure if it would affect the warranty on the seat, and it doesn't really fit our seat anyway. I really bought it to use in the stroller and carrier. For those, it works great! It really snuggles my baby so he doesn't flop around (he's three weeks old and is just starting to get some head control when he's awake). It's also adjustable, so it will grow with him for a while."
5,Love it!,"This is my third child so I've been through many products trying to find something that works with the babies in the car seat. This is the only product that ever worked perfectly the first time! And my daughter loves being all snug in her car seat. She doesn't shift at all or slide down. Her head still flops forward every once in a while, but there's really no way to stop that. We have used this since the day she left the hospital. I definitely recommend it!"
1,Nice but hospital made us take is out of car seat before they would allow us to take baby home,"It looks nice and cuddly, easy to install, etc. But be aware, that some (if not all) US hospitals WILL NOT LET YOU USE THIS to take your newborn home. The nurse that checked us out on car seat safety/use insisted that we remove this before letting us take our son home. She claims they have been poven unsafe.If it's unsafe like the nurse claimed, then why does everyone seem to use them??I was unable to return ours which upset me even more."
3,"great idea, but...",This is not meant for a car seat at all. it pushes the tots head forward way too far for it to be safe.I did however use it in my son's stroller and it worked fantastic! it was my favorite go to piece. in addition I would lay it out flat on the ground and it made a great mat for him to lay on.
4,Great for newborns,"I bought this to use as my newborn would slip down and have very poor head support in his car seat. Gave him great support and kept him snug, perhaps too much occasionally!"
5,Fabulous Product,"This product made our careseat (Regal Ride) usable for our 8lb infant. The care seat is rated to 5lbs, but it was way too big for our little baby, and our baby hated it until we got the snuzzler. Now he actually fits the lowest shoulder strap and appears comfortable. I plan to use this in his Snugride as well as his swing! And it is machine washable."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!!,I thought this was the perfect gift for my Sister-in-law at her shower...we set it up in the carseat and it was sooo cute!! Weeks later at the hospital they wouldn't let her use it--it doesn't physically attach to the carseat so in an accident this could actually make the seat more dangerous by slipping or being thrown out of the seat....WASTE OF MONEY!!!
3,Cute but...,I could not put it in and have it lay flat like the picture shows. I am concerned this may cause discomfort for my baby (due in thirteen days) but we will see when we begin using it.
2,Callas or Tebaldi or Sutherland,"To the critic who wonder why Tebaldi was a rival with Callas probably have never heard Tebaldi. Tebaldi had one of the most ravishing sopranos of our time, along with great stage presence. But for the full glory of the human voice. Dame Joan Sutherland's cd ""The art the Prima Donna"" remains the greatest coloratura recording of all time. Callas is excellent here, and she was the greatest singing actress of all time, but she is no Sutherland in the vocal department!"
3,Callas is no coloratura...,"Maria Callas, though wonderful on stage, has no coloratura voice. She has a unique voice and technique that I can admire, but being a coloratura myself, I know she is not one. If you want to try to listen to some good coloratura, listen to Edita Gruberova or Sylvia Sass!"
1,No definition to her coloratura,"Maria Callas should not have strayed toward the bel canto reportoire. I find her coloratura to have no definition. Why not listen to the new superstar Sumi Jo. If some people find Sumi Jo chirpy, maybe they're being closed minded. Her voice is far more lovely then Callas' ugly, ugly sound, and much more expressive than Sutherland's liveless one."
4,Great product!!,As other reviews the picture isn't that great.. but the watch is absolutely gorgeous .. not that big and not that heavy compared with other stylish watches .. not suitable for teenagers but for a grown women!
3,They changed the ingredients at the end of 2012,I have always bought this produce because it used to contain 2000 mg of arginine. Now it only contains 1600 mg of arginine. Just a heads up on that for those who did not notice. This change occurred at the end of 2012.
3,Sitting on the fence.,"This is actually a pretty well-written book on President Polk. It seemed to me though that the author, who wants to be complimentary of Polk and his presidency, has a difficult time being consistent with his appraisal. I am not sure that he has convinced himself of the compliments he pays our 11th President. And while it is admittedly focused on the time spent in office, I would have liked more of Polk's pre-presidential years."
1,Not Good at All!,"1. Amazon Description gives the impression that it includes the frame. But it does not and it will cost you over 60$ to get that separately. It must state clearly that for this item you need to buy the frame separately or it will be worthless.2. The cover has total of 3 cheap buttons to fasten the front (instead of a zipper or at least more buttons!) and dust can easily migrate into the cover!! Which defeats the purpose.Unfortunately none of the comments included this information and it seems I am the only one who was dumb enough not to know what I am getting or dislike what I got.If you want to protect your clothing, get something else. I returned this product."
5,Garment Rack Cover,Very crisp and sharp look to cover messy clothes!!! I like this in combination with the rolling rack!
3,Cover Won't Close - Front Panels Too Narrow,"I have four of these garment racks, in which all of husband's shirts, suits, slacks, and blazers are stored. (European house; no closets.)The racks are excellent - very, very sturdy; the covers are made of heavy canvas and are quite durable.I'm knocking two stars off the rating because the front panels are too narrow, so I can't get the covers to button. If I only had one rack, I'd write it off as an isolated mistake. Four non-closing covers indicate a production problem."
3,"Great Idea, Poor Execution","I ordered this for my Whitmor Supreme Rack. It is easy to get on and fits perfectly.However, given the cost of the product, I was really disappointed in the quality of the cover. The product buttons up the front to close. There are five buttons. Two of the buttons did not match up to the button holes (not even close---about 2 inches off). I had to remove the buttons and sew them in the right spot. Two of the other button holes were stitched for the button hole, but the center wasn't cut out, so I had to do that as well. At the end of the day, it wasn't worth the effort of taking it off and sending it back for a replacement, but for $27 I was pretty mad that I had to do the extra work to make it functional. Clearly it was a miss in some quality control.Overall, the product is thick and covers the product very snugly. Aside from this issue, it was a great purchase. I'm hoping this issue was an isolated incident!"
4,Good Quality,This cover makes the rack disappear into the room. It adds a little style to an otherwise bare but functional metal clothes rack. The cream/offwhite cloth cover (muslin?) is very sturdy and is held in by buttons. Some people may prefer a zipper so I thought I'd mention that. I'm very happy with the quality and it shipped quickly. It fits the matching rack perfectly -- be sure to get the correct whitmor rack. I will review the rack separately.
4,Great Product!,"Nice Neutral Shade, good quality Canvas. Button Closure (zipper might have been nicer). Fits quickly/easily over the Garment Rack. Well-made."
4,"nice, neat cover","This is made of heavy, substantial canvas, not at all like a sheet, which I was fearing. A neutral linen color, and fits like a glove on the Supreme Garment Rack. Unlike other folks, I am not overly fond of the buttons, as it takes longer to undue them than a zipper, and if you leave them unbuttoned, the front gaps open a bit (if there were overlap of the fabric, that would take care of it) . With it buttoned, however, it looks quite attractive. Not a big deal for my purposes, as my garment rack is behind a screen in the corner of my room anyway. Overall, I am very happy with the combo of garment rack and cover."
3,Supreme Garment Rack Cover,The cover for the supreme garment rack is spectacular. It makes the rack look very fashionable and like a piece of furniture. I love it. It has solved my lack of closet space.
4,"Nice, but wish there was a bottom","Was very pleased with the sturdy fabric and so easy to put on. I wish it had a way to have an attached bottom. Of course, if I had brought down the top shelf, it would probably reach the floor. It is not self-containing."
3,My Mistake,I thought I was ordering a clothes rack but it was the rack cover so I've never opened it. It looks to be in good condition and I'm sure it would have been fine if that's what I actually needed.
3,Great quality but..,"It wasn't what I expect.. I needed something else so I had to return it, but other than that it's a great product, just make sure you also buy the rack to cover.."
1,Disappointing,The picture shown for this item is extremely misleading!! It gives the impression that the price includes the garment rack (which is sold separately).
4,Wonderful Songs and Content with One Caveat,"My almost 3 year old loves this video. It is professional, visually and musically interesting. He asks for it frequently (it competes with fire trucks, no small accomplishment!).The caveat is that the brochos are all said with HaShem's name - no elokaynu and no HaShem. If that troubles you, like it does us, it could be a problem."
5,Don't even think twice . ..,"Must buy all of these DVDS!!!! I never write reviews but I have to say that as a mom, I never get sick of watching all of their DVDs and believe me, we've watched them over and over and over again. Each time we put it on, my now 20 month old gets so excited - especially when he hears Dayenu. It's a great present for new parents as well . .. I just wish they'd make more!"
4,Great songs and fun product,This is a fun product and highlights some basics in Hebrew and Jewish traditions. I often turn the DVD on in the background without the video so we can listen to the songs while playing.
1,oy baby 2 DVD,Not worth it I wish that we had not bought it the cds are really good the movies are really bad
2,"My kids adored #1, wre bored by #2","Not sure exactly why, but my three kids (5, 2 and 2) can;t get enough of Oy Baby, but have virtually no interest in Oy Baby 2. It seems less fun, although it was nice to actually see the singers."
3,"The message is still potent, but the text is well shuffled","It goes without saying that this book remains a landmark in the history of AI research: a sobering antidote to all the research hype.But what a patchwork it has become. Every ten years, the book has a new section and a new introduction bolted on to it. But not just bolted on to the end, or on to the beginning.No reader is given an easy path through the text: neither the reader who is new to the material (and who wants to read through the text in chronological order), nor the reader who has read the previous incarnation of the book (and who wants to pick up just the new parts).The message of the book, too, is unfortunately weakened by its subjective stance, and its invocation of the personalities from the debate.However, the book still remains a refreshingly different contribution to the world of AI research, an important warning, and a greatly worthwhile read."
4,Convincing Critique,"Berkeley Professor Hubert Dreyfus assesses the predictions and subsequent failures of artificial intelligence from its inception in the 1960's with innovators like Turing to the present day with a detailed and honest account of why higher level AI is impossible. After evaluating the history of AI's minuscule progress, Dreyfus provides a compelling analysis of human intelligence, drawing on the philosophies of Heidegger, Wittgenstein, and Merleau-Ponty in order to demonstrate that higher level cognitive faculties are not reducible to computational representations. This book is an important reversal of commonly accepted assumptions within the cognitive sciences, from linguistics to psychology. It is also an important example of why the cognitive sciences would benefit from paying greater attention to the achievements of contemporary European philosophy."
5,They are shoe laces,"They are shoe laces and they are yellow. If you need yellow shoe laces, these will do the trick. I used them in conjunction with a pair of Adidas I also bought on amazon in order to replicate a pair of Zissou shoes from the movie Life Aquatic."
3,meh.,"ok, great item when mixed with cisco proprietary DB-9/RJ-45 adapter and works well with the older laptops running XP or newer OS....terrible USB support on Vista and neither Belkin nor Dell offer a driver. Oh, the pic is outdated on this listing, it's a bit more modern now and features link activity LED's and a more attractive package. This product gives me just one more reason to hate MS Vista OS... :/J.BSystems Engineer"
3,"Great, as long as you have XP","On my XP laptop, this adapter works flawlessly with a wide range of serial devices. On my 32bit Vista desktop, it is unstable and unpredictable. It's useless with 64bit Vista (no drivers)"
1,Wrong Cable,"I ordered the Belkin F5U257 cable specifically for Windows 7. If Amazon had sent, the correct cable that would have been perfect and I would have rated it as a 5. However, they just threw some junk USB to Serial adapter in the box and sent it to me. The customer service rep argued with me and said I got what I ordered. I had to escalate in order to get the problem resolved.Just another story of pathetic customer service, that seems to be pervasive in all industries today."
5,Belkin FSU409-CU does work with Windows 7!,"First, this is a Belkin FSU407-CU, not a FSU409V1 as stated in the tech specs. Amazon should correct this. Anyway, when I received the adapter, I tried to install it on my new Win 7 64 bit laptop and the driver supplied did not work. I researched the web and kept getting responses that said there were no Win 7 32 or 64 bit drivers for this adapter, not even Vista drivers. More research however turned up this website - [...] Copy and paste this into your browser and you will find a link to a downloadable driver from the Magic Control Technologies site. Download and install their U232-P9 driver package and after restarting your computer the darned thing will finally recognize the adapter and configure a driver for it! Haven't used the adapter yet but I'll bet it works fine."
3,"Corny, but stll a good date night film","A dream come true for marriage counselors as this couple suffers from.everything! A few good laughs and some awwwws from the ladies means it works, despite some cheesy lines."
1,Not the best of Susan Johnson's,"Susan Johnson tries way too hard with this book. In her effortto make Prince Stefan look like a terrific catch that everywoman wants, she gets way too carried away with her descriptivephrases and exaggerations and makes the Prince sound like aperson I wouldn't even want to meet. Her descriptions of thePrince are downright laughable. There isn't a man on earth thatcould act the way he does and still have the women like him.But it was interesting reading, though I consider the book adud. I own over a dozen of this authors books and this one ison the bottom of my list."
2,Disappointing,"As an avid inkwell collector I was very excited about a new book coming out on the subject. The last books I got on inkwells were the Badders' books from 1995, so I was ready for an update. Wow, was I disappointed! First, the book is not organized in any way. It seems they may have tried to organize by subject matter (lion, girl, etc.)but this system is erratic. Secondly, they have obviously not taken into account the market fluctuations due to online auctions. I have seen mint inkwells sell for $250 where this book estimates values at $300-$500. On the other hand, I have seen an estimate of a $200 inkwell selling for $400. These examples are not a ""one time"" situation, they are consistant. I realize that this is probably a difficult factor to add into estimating, but if you are going to call yourself an expert and publish a book about it, you should consider all factors."
4,Not Just Seasonal-,"Not being a 60-something soccer grandma, nor more than 1/4 Italian, nor hailing from the Garden State in the 1960s, I am somewhat at a loss to explain my affinity to this music.It must be the 4-part harmony.And the fact that Joe Pesci was their first manager (no kidding)(how is that funny? Do I 'amuse' you?)and Jersey Boys was actually quite good."
1,bad product,Received discs and started playing and on both there were scratches or something that caused the disc to skip and repeat.
5,Memories,I had forgotten how much I liked the Four Seasons until I saw Jersey Boys. This collection brings back all of the good memories. Wonderful!
5,Love Franki Valli,"Love, love, love this CD (actually 2 CD's) It has all the Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons songs on it that you would want. I recently saw the play, ""Jersey Boys"" which reignited my love for this music. I play the CD constantly when I'm in my car. It's well worth buying."
4,Four Seasons,"This is a great collection of almost of the Four Seasons hits . They did an excellent job for the most part remixing this it sounds pretty good . I was somewhat dissappointed that they included mono versions of a couple there best songs which were ""Dawn"" and Rag Doll . Got hooked on this sound after seeing Jersey Boys "" . If you get the chance see this great Broadway play."
3,SO BIG!!,I bought this for my husband for Christmas. We both liked the appearance of the watch but the face is so large that he looked as if he was wearing an alarm clock on his wrist. We ended up returning it for a smaller blue faced watch by Citizen.
3,stethoscope diaphragm,"Thank you for your speedy response. It did arrive middle of last week. I am not sure if I was mistaken as to the Classic II or III or if I really have just a Classic Stethoscope. The diaphragm did arrive, it doesn't really look the same as I had. Mine didn't screw on to the stethoscope. I had a lot of difficulty put it on. I am not sure I actually did get it on correctly. The diaphragm itself looks much thinner then I had. I will try this one for now."
4,good quality!,"I ordered this on a Saturday night. I had it the following Saturday morning. I would have liked to have seen it ship sooner. I think it would have shipped the next Monday, however i believe it was on Wednesday when it actually went out. My only reasoning was I am a paramedic and needed my stethoscope back in service as quick as possible, therefore i ordered 2 just incase for the next time. Quality is top notch and the diaphragm works just as the original did (light pressure for high tones and firm pressure for deep tones). It would have been 5 out of 5 stars if it shipped on Monday!"
2,NCAA Reversible Tote,This item looks so cheap it does not as seen as picture. Do not waste your money I bought it as a gift when I see it was snock. It is just 5 dolar produck if the turnig procude was not so long I will sent it back but already trash its box
5,Great Book,This is one of the finest books that i have ever received and will greatly help us in the care and feeding of our new hoirse
2,Far from complete,"This book covers a lot of topics, but none of them in any detail. I've been taking lessons and leasing a horse for several years now and am considering taking the leap into owning a horse, and I was hoping to find a book that would give me a realistic idea of the expenses and responsibilities involved with actually keeping a horse. This is not that book.This book might be fine to give to kids who just need a cursory understanding of horse care, but is not useful for anyone seriously considering buying or keeping horses."
5,Superb,I love this book. Covered everything. Lots of info and pictures clearly explained. Best book I've purchased so far on this subject. Great buy.
2,Maybe if your a Child,"This book has some useful info but for the most part anyone over the age 15, or anyone who has pretty good horse knowledge, will find this book to be pretty annoying. Full of beginer ""how to's"""
4,An Overall Look At Horse Care For the First owner,It gave good one-one instructions using pictures as aids. It gave good charts on nutrition. It was easy to understand.
5,Great Book-I loved it,"The book covers all the things you need to know about horses, from feeding, to blanking, to stabling,to riding, to training, to caring for a ill horse. It tells you how to measure for tack, how to put tack on, and what tack you need for your horse. I have read this book from cover to cover and would definately give it 5 stars! Great book, I would highly recomend it as a gift or for the horse person wanting to learn more about horses!"
4,Good book for someone looking for a broad range of info,"A lot of information in this book. It covers just about everything. I was hoping for a little more information on feeding, but overall a good buy. One note: if you are looking for tack and riding info, this book focuses mostly on english riding. There is very little reference to western riding."
4,horse care,The book is very helpful. I had no idea on the plants that would and could hurt my horse. It is well written so that I can understand it. I would recommend it to every horse person. The book is well worth the price...
1,This company should be put out of business,I have not received the book I ordered or heard from the company. I ordered the book on October 28 and it is now the afternoon of November 30. This is shameful. Don't use this vendor
2,Couldn't Wear It,"I have a slightly wider than average foot for a woman, and that affected my ability to wear this splint. Although the splint is nicely padded and has nice straps to hold a foot securely, it doesn't leave enough space at the ball of the foot. I traded in plantar fascitis for pain at the ball of the foot. After several nights of waking up with what might be called bunion pain (but I don't have bunions), I gave up on this splint."
2,Not as advertised,"The one shipped to me was not the one as shown in the picture, nor in the written description. I wanted ""the variable-speed auto-walk system"" (as described), and I was sent one with a single speed. I has a bail lever and not as the one in the description. If you investigate further, Poulan Pro makes or has made several drive variations on this same mower. The manual that comes with the mower describes several. Amazon customer service did a great job with the return and credit, however."
5,Great value and performance with this basic keyboard & mouse!,"I was very pleased with this purchase. I wanted a keyboard and mouse that connected via PS/2 (old style plugs) instead of USB. The keyboard is well constructed and attractive without all the ""bells & whistles"" that I would not use anyway. The mouse also performs well and feels very comfortable in your hand. I have had good luck with quite a few Logitech products. If you want an excellent ""no frills"" keyboard and mouse which utilize the PS/2, plug type connection to free up your USB ports for other peripherals, I would highly recommend this product. It gets ""two thumbs up"" from me!"
4,Pretty good for the money.,"The keyboard is lightweight but works well. The mouse thumb wheel is great for scrolling. The only thing annoying is that the cursor sometimes disappears and ends up in remote areas of the screen - not sure why this is, 'though I suspect it has something to do with the light-sensor on the mouse."
4,Keyboard and mouse,Logitech 967973-0403 Internet 250 Desktop Vista Keyboard and MouseVery good for the price. I needed a keyboard and mouse for a computer going to a kids daycare center and this is perfect or them. I bought two so I would have a spare set.
1,Good Deal IF Vista would recognize it,"I tried just about everything.....downloading drivers off the internet, rebooting, checking my device managers, and still could get Vista to recognize the keyboard and mouse. Actually ended up throwing the keyboard and mouse in the garbage."
1,great album if....,you enjoy long walks on the beach. Boring music with out any heart. Oh my god does this kinda music suck. This so boring how do u people sleep at night.... Probally pretty well if u listin to this crap.
1,I wish zero stars was an option,"It is a joke that this awful album has been given a five star rating,as it should not have got anthing more than one star.This over rated group only had two good albums(self titled debut and Brothers in arms).Dont buy this if you like good music.get albums likeMETALLICA-MASTER OF PUPPETSMETALLICA-AND JUSTICE FOR ALLMETALLICA-RIDE THE LIGHTNINGAC/DC-FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCKAC/DC-HIGH VOLTAGELED ZEPPELIN-PRESENCETHE BEATLES-ABBEY ROADTHE BEATLES-THE WHITE ALBUMTHE ROLLING STONES-STICKY FINGERSBLACK SABBATH-PARANOIDBLACK SABBATH-MASTER OF REALITYIRON MAIDEN-POWERSLAVESLAYER-SEASONS IN THE ABYSSPANTERA-FAR BEYOND DRIVENMEGADETH-COUNTDOWN FROM EXTICTIONQUEEN-NEWS OF THE WORLDQUEEN-LIVE FROM THE BOWL."
1,JUNK,"I really despise dire straits whom i always felt were one of the most overrated bands of all time.making movies is one of the worst albums ever.dont buy it.buy albums from Pink Floyd,Led Zeppelin and the rolling stones instead."
5,one of the greatest albums ever,"I'm totally in love with this great album. it has some really great songs. I think Mark knopfler does Tunnel of Love really well and it is one of my top 5 favorite songs of all time, and it is really really lovely. please play it at any party. Romeo and Juliet is a great song too, great lyrics and music. But my other favourite one is Espresso love. I think Knopfler does that one really well too, and so for Solid rock and Skateaway. This is one album every rock fan must listen to. I want more and more and more of this album. I love it. Please buy this right now."
5,wonderful to hear once again,"Brings back some ""old"" memories. LOL. Enjoyed them when and still surprised to remember most of the words.Good job of remastering or what ever you call it."
5,Great follow up album,"I have the first two CD's by Dire Straight and I think that you are either going to get Mark Knopler or you aren't. I enjoy his work but I would imagine, like most of his fans, I realize he doesn't have a great singing voice in a traditional sense. However, the way he works that to his advantage is what is so interesting about his work. Plus, he's a maestro on the guitar. I think that if you like the first album, you'll like this album and vice versa. I think I like ""Skate Away"" more than ""Sultan's of Swing"". ""Solid Rock"" is real spirited rocker and I don't think I will get tired of that one. All the other cuts on the second album are enjoyable if you can appreciate Knopler's clever songwriting. But, if you don't, he always has some nice guitar work to latch onto. But, if you don't like tasty guitar licks, then you probably won't enjoy Dire Straights."
5,Timeless,"This warm, lush recording of Dire Straits third, and to most fans, best album, is an almost continuous wall of beautiful music. Mark Knopfler, probably all of 30 when he penned this classic, plays guitar and writes songs that will break your heart. I suspect that most of this music was recorded live, with little dubbing, so powerful and moving is the sound. The lead song, ""Tunnel of Love"" is a bittersweet ode to love and loss. Most of the other songs have love story elements to them. I think I was 15 when I first heard this music; it's as moving 21 years later as it was then. Buy it."
4,Deserves Attention,"Less well known than other Dire Straits recordings, this album contains some gems."
3,Good but not all that great,"This is a good album from Dire Straits, but not the best. The great songs are classics Tunnel Of Love, Expresso Love, & Solid Rock. But, I get tired of this album really easy after 4 because I realize that this CD is a little slower. Try to get American Idiot from Green Day, it rocks harder and it is noisier and better than this. But I still love Dire Straits, they have talent and make great music."
2,a bit overrated,"This is it, only 2 good songs but then they are still getting old. I recommend go get an addiction of On Every Street, and Foreigner 4, and Guns N' Roses 3 insted. This is just as overrated as GREEN DAY."
2,One of the most boring records ever,"I'm sick of this...people really love the most popular Dire Straits and they suck. Making Movies is just as bad as Brothersin Arms and has some of the worst songs in 'Hand in hand'. It's just a dumb one. This deserves 2 because 'Tunnel of Love', and 'Expresso Love' are the great. Go get Love Over Gold or Metallica Black Album insted.1 more thing, overrated."
2,Love over gold is better than this!!,"Making Movies was a pretty overrated album just like the debut.What I think is that the 2nd song on the album, ROMEO AND JULIET,uhh, this song is a bit overrated. It is not a song about love either. I think Foreigner's Waiting for a Girl Like You is more lovely than Romeo and Juliet because of the lyrics and nice vocals. I think Love Over Gold is better because of the heavier power. I can think of 2 maybe 3 good songs on Making Movies but the rest of the songs are crappy. Even a Guns N' Roses and Metallica CD/LP is better than this! Ignore this and the debut and get Love Over Gold insted."
2,?,Yo. Brah...Dire Straits is not a good band. Never. Ever.This is stuff for like office workers who cut it wild at happy hour and then need something sweet to drive home to.Dude.You can do so much more with your life...Fight the feed!!!!!Fight the feed!!!!!But I have to admit. When I was 11. I didn't know better and probalby played this album 30 times...well...not the whole album...Please people. Stop.
5,Awsome CD!,"If you are into Hip-Hop or Barney music, you may not like it. If you are a normal person who has good taste for music, you will love it!"
5,Best CD Behind On Every Street,"This is definately the best by On Every Street. My favorites offthis are Tunnel of Love, Skateaway, Expresso Love, & Solid Rock.Others I like are Romeo and Juliet. Les Boys is their worst songthey ever made. If you have a plan, or if you are a straits fan,go ahead, buy this cd and save money for On Every Street.Albums to Buy in addition to this one.ON EVERY STREETON THE NIGHTLOVE OVER GOLDSULTANS OF SWING"
5,The Great!!!!,"This is one of my most favourite albums from Dire Straits,Dire Straits are amongst my favourite bands of all time, anywayhere's how the songs are on this CD.Tunnel of Love 10/10 Excellent song, one of my favorites.I really love this song.Romeo and Juliet 8/10 Kinda week but the On The Night versionis so much better.Skateaway 11/10 Love love love!!!! I love this song this isamongst my favorite song on the whole album. Last night I wasstaring at Skateaway girl listening to this song on ITUNES.I love this song, I love this song I love this song.Expresso Love 11/10 Love love love!!!! I love this songamongst my 2nd favorite on the album. I love it.Hand in Hand 7/10 Ok, but not the best. Still not my favoriteat times.Solid Rock 10/10 Great, great great!!! Really great songa must repeat.Les Boys 9/10 Great song.Buy this CD along with the great GNR greatest hits today."
5,Knopfler's masterpiece,"When I'm asked what my favorite album of all time is, my answer is often Making Movies. I had heard ""Skateaway"" on the radio for years and loved it, but I didn't know any other songs on the album. My lukewarm feelings for ""Brothers in Arms"" kept me away from Dire Straits, but the day I finally bought this was a great one. The first three tracks, ""Tunnel of Love,"" ""Romeo and Juliet,"" and ""Skateaway,"" are flawless. ""Tunnel of Love"" allows Knopfler the time to build his intricate guitar work and showcases the piano skills of a borrowed member of the E Street Band. ""Romeo and Juliet"" is a love song...of sorts. Knopfler's fingerstyle acoustic is impressive. This version leaves the Indigo Girls' subsequent cover in the dust.This is what made me a Dire Straits fan. And if you like this one, check out their first album as well."
1,Door won't open.,"I will not buy from this company again. Cheap for lite-on means doesn't work. The door to my Lite-On DVD/CD rewritable drive (manufactured 10/2006) doesn't open. It stays stuck. I finally have to trash it and will buy Toshiba again which has worked reliably for years and years. This was a 2nd drive in my system, and has always gotten stuck on occasion. Now it's permanently stuck. Disappointing."
1,Cheap!! Crap!!,"Don't buy this mine worked for a day and then crapped out.... I tried new batteries and everything. Didn't bother returning. I wish I would have now but I thought i could get it to work, no such luck. Spend your $$ on something else."
3,Nice,This is an enjoyable book that doesn't add any more stress to my life. But about halfway through I hatted the female main character. She kinda redeems in the end.
4,A Perfect Stranger,Raphaella marry's her fathers business partner John Henry when she is 18 years old. When John Henry becomes incapacitated Raphaella does not give up her duties as a wife. Even when she meets a man who falls in love with her she remains loyal to her husband whom she shows great respect.This book was fab. well recommended.
3,"Great characters, ruined by repetitive storyline","I have read every book by Ms. Steele. She is amazing in her characterizations, you really feel as if you know her characters .The story itself was pretty engrossing, but the repetitions of leaving and going back got to be too much. I almost wished poor Alex would have left HER for a change."
2,"Written in 1981; not her mature plotting, but nice in parts.","The setting and much of the characterization are great, and parts of the action; but the logic of the plot is awful--three likable people behaving irrationally and giving each other years of anguish through not talking about important matters that they would have been half-witted not to discuss openly. But DS was just finding her feet in those days, so we can forgive her! And there are parts of the romance that are charming, to enjoy anyway!"
4,A book for all occasions,"This book reveal beautiful safricies & giving that teaches us how to share our feelings & thoughts with the ons we love unconditionally.Raphealla is a great example for a woman that reflects beauty from both inside & out, her tender heart shows throughout all her relations , & how she faces life challenges with pride & dignity.Danielle brings out the divinity of wonderful relationships between all the book characters."
3,Good but not Great,"This was a typical D.S. book. I have read a few of Ms. Steele's books and they always leave me satisfied but I'm never passionate about her books. This time was no different. If you want a nice, laid back read - this is a good book for you. If you want passion, excitement and fireworks - skip it."
1,LOUSY,Build instructions consisted of a few random pages on tuning plus a photocopied blowup schematic of the carb. taken from Holly's original manuals. The photocopy was so poor that it could not be read.Box contained the wrong power valve for the carb.
4,Wonderful but....,These stone coasters were great. They perform well and look great... but... I wish they were a little more vivid. The are really neat but just a little quiet. Some people may like them that way but i wanted them to be a little darker not particularly in color but in depth.
3,OVERCOMING THE ODDS,"THIS WAS DEFINITELY A HEARTWARMING AND TOUCHING STORY ABOUT LETTING GO OF THE THINGS AND BELIEFS AND TRUSTING SOMEONE ELSE. FOXX HAD A HARD TIME TRUSTING CONSIDERING HER PAST, BUT LOVE WAS DEFINITELY JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED FOR THIS PERPETUAL WORKAHOLIC. THE BOOK WAS DEFINITELY BETTER THAN THE MOVIE ADAPTATION."
5,Superb,"All I can say is Mrs. Green has done it again! I read this book in two days! I hope that there will be a sequel, as there are so many questions that can be answered. This is definitely a page turner and once you start you will not be able to stop!"
4,A beautiful love story!!,"I really enjoyed this novel by Mrs. Green. I 've read almost all of her novels and I haven't been disappointed yet. Van was so adamant about keeping his relationship with Fox strictly professional. Howevr, things turned out to be the way they were supposed to be."
3,good for use with book,"Although this is quite a good source for Upton's Sinclair's The Jungle, I will be the first to admit that certain aspects are not fully revealed here. I having read the book and the cliff notes version, can whole heartedly recommend that if you do have paper to right upon the subject, the distinctions made in this book, about certain symbolic references that may not really viewed to the naked eye alone, is great and granted to get you at least and A. I would definitely recommend this book as a source to go along with the actual text. This is most certainly helpful, but on its own, it is left wanting and one will most certainly not receive proper recognition with this alone."
5,Organ Music from France,"This may be the only recording of the Durufle Suite No 5 for organ available. I've had the original vinyl since I started organ and I've still never tired of listening to it. It's very dazzling stuff, yet incredibly beastly to play. This is GREAT organ music. The Durufle performance alone is worth the price of the CD."
1,Typical garbage from Publish America,I'm not sure why Amazon.com sells books from this publisher. All the ones I have encountered have been awful. This one is no exception. There is just no reason to purchase books from this publisher.
1,idiots,"d'nb is the uk's answer to hip hop?i have never heard a more stupid statement in my entire life.people who know nothing about d'nb and it's history should just shut up. this disc sucks. it's overmixed and redundant. adam fused to put out some hard-step, stomping stuff in the late 90's,but hasn't done anything decent in a long time. check out somemoving shadow stuff, tech itch, dillinja and high contrast way before you buy this."
4,pretty good mixes,"just a couple of correctional notes here to the comments made prior to mine. first of all adam f produced most of the tracks on these cd's. His label Kaos is the reason these tracks exist, second of all whoever recommended something produced by moving shadow.... moving shadow is a label that produces drum n bass. otherwise, slammin roughneck business rinsin fo real. big ups to both djs keepin the worldwide circuit hot. drum n bass is the uk's answer to hip hop, and these mixes are tha gap bridgas yall, respect and bigupyaself for reading this"
1,MIlo,This stuff is okay for what it is. But if you are a Aussie this is not Aussie Milo. I guess I need to get my dad to post some more :-)
3,Good product bad service,We were lucky that this arived in time before my daughter left. From the time we were notified that the order was recieved until it shipped was 10 days. Thats badThe produce was great. Nestle always does good.
3,"dvorak rocks, but what about the New World Symphony?","Great intro for any beginnner,but there was one piece that was missing and that was the New World Symphony. It would have gotten more stars if it had it on the cd."
3,Not so good,"I have had serval pairs of New Balance shoes. They look decent and are very comfortable. But this pair of shoes are not so comfortable, and do not look so good too."
1,very disappointed,"im really so disappointed with this new balance , its really hard to wear it for long hours , my feet hurts, now i dont know what to do with it , i probably just gonna throw it on the trash , i wasted $38 , dont be fooled by false reviews , i have the same 574 but i bought it from a local store and its really good , the reason i bought the next one from amazon because it was hard to find the EE size at local stores , i should have a refund for this ,i know amazon dont return worn shoes , but i was expecting same comfort as the one i bought from a local store , iam very dissappointed"
1,39.99 on Selected Colors and sizes a lie.,"Only one color is available for the sale price, and not even in all sizes. It should read ""Sale. $39.99 on selected color..."""
1,nada contento,"el producto aun no ha llegado al lugar de destino, tiene mas de un mes de retraso y aun no ha sido despachado para recibirlo en mi local..."
2,Even the wides were not very wide,"I loved the shoe itself, i.e., the quality of its production and the colors, and in general have had great experiences with new balance in the past, but I ordered the wides and they were not really wide at all.If you are not a wide foot like myself, then this will not really apply to you, and you should read another review."
4,NB 574,"The folks at New Balance seem to have me in mind when they made these. There Comfy, functional, & Stylin."
5,Superior comfort,I would rate that shoes more than 5 stars.It is extra light.Very comfortable for walking.Excellent value for the money.I have paid 250$ for New Balance Men's MR2002 Training Shoe & it is less comfortable than 50$ shoes!!
3,New Balance,These were represented as Gray and Navy. They are SILVER and Navy Blue. Luckily they are running shoes for my son and color is not as important as fit. He is very happy with them. They are true to size and very comfortable.
2,slip-in insoles PITA,"Nowhere does it say this shoe has a slip-in insole. I HATE removable insoles so I'm returning. Also, the box came sealed like new shoes, but one shoe had been laced - rather sloppily leaving twisty creases in the lace - a clear indication this was a return or a store second. Not sure I'm guaranteed a factory-fresh shoe when I buy thru Amazon, but that's what I expected. Wouldn't you?"
2,Stretched Out In Under a Month...,"First, these shoes look amazing. The navy suede over the silver really stands out. The N logo on the side even shimmers in the sunlight. So in that regard, they were perfect.As for comfort, they're as good as any Airwalks or Vans I've ever worn before. The insole isn't super thick, but it offers some protection from the rocks and whatnot.The durability, unfortunately, doesn't seem to be working out for me. One of the shoes, the tighter of the two when I tried them on, has stretched out at least half a size in under a month. It went from rubbing my big toe a bit to my heel suddenly slipping out of the cup. I tried new insoles, that didn't work. I tried the heel lock lacing, and that didn't work. It just seems to be too big for my foot now, a little over a month after the purchase.It's very frustrating, as I loved the shoes originally, but now my heel is sore from rubbing against the back of the shoe."
2,New Balance shoes,Bought these for my husband and was wondering why they were so cheap. We love New Balance. But these were made in China!! What's up New Balance? We love you cause you're made in the USA!!!
5,Great Shoes,I love these shoes and will continue to order these wide shoes and I absolutely love these comfortable shoes. They are also long lasting and durable for all occassions.
5,Well made classic,I wore these to school (as a teacher I am on my feet all day). Best shoe I have bought for school and at a reasonable price. I have bad knees and need something with cushioning and support. At the end of 4 days my knees hurt much less than usual and these shoes breathe enough so my feet weren't sweaty.
2,"Too small, used","Both of these were smaller than any 13 shoe I've ever worn, especially the right shoe, which is too small to even wear. The silver finish is worn off around the edge like they'd already been used. Not a good purchase"
1,Defective left shoe,"Defective product, left shoe too tight and a bit short! I have had three other pairs of New Balance 574' s with out a problem."
4,Good shoe at a great price.,"I've never owned this brand before. But, I liked what I saw in the picture... They simply looked comfortable. And I was right. Their light weight, style and color was just what I was looking for.From my experience with these great shoes, I would buy this brand again."
3,Not good for anything involving jumping.,"I gave these shoes three stars because they are comfortable and good for just walking around. However, I would not ever do anything that involves running or jumping in these shoes. The aharp edge on the bottoms make it difficult to land safely. I've sprained my ankles three times in these shoes playing volleyball (went up for spike, came down with the worst sprain I've ever had), basketball (sprained while trying to cut while running; foot sideways and my ankle gave), and once just walking (walking along a sidewalk, I stepped on a tiny pebble. my foot went sideways, and the edge of the bottom cause my ankle to go out instead of helping my foot go flat. minor roll, could've sprained). I'm prone to sprains, but I've never had this many issues with any shoe before. Here's hoping it doesn't happen to someone else, though I'm sure it has."
1,left one of pair is warped.. I wish I didn't make this purchase.,"left one of pair is warped.. I wish I didn't make this purchase.if you don't see and touch anything you want to buy, do not buy it."
4,really like then,Shoes arrived quickly. Great shoes. Even came with white and grey laces. I thought that was cool. If you've stoen NB before you won't be disappointed
5,Good Shoe,"IDK why there is such a price variation between colors, but this color scheme was at least $20 cheaper than the others without looking fugly. I've been getting a new pair of 574's every year or so for the last 5 years, and I'm always happy with the fit and durability, considering I wear them daily. This is the first time I bought shoes at Amazon, but only because I know which size will fit. They also have a good selection of sizes available too, which is great."
3,It's my style,It is so good to me. and size is also perfect. but one is error. good has scratch in logo 'N'
3,"good, but little bit small for me.","I usually wear 11.5, but it was a bit small for me.The product was good, so i will try 12."
4,Surprising good for a first timer,"Very good album from Chely Wright however she released this traditional country album when country music was beginning to go more mainstream and modern contemerary direction.Probably why this album didn't do much for Ms. Wrights career.Very well done.""Let Me In"" is her best album."
4,Moon Light,"Woman in the Moon, Chely Wright's debut album, is her most traditionally country album. It gets a healthy 4 stars as it's good music. I'm not the biggest fan of the traditional genre, so I didn't feel it enough for 5. But it's of doubtless high quality. Here are songs:Till I was Loved by You - fast and livelyHe's a Good Ole Boy - humorous. Chely gives away some guy on condition that he can't be returend. This one is fast and lively tooTill All Her Tears are DryGo On and On - fast and livelyWoman in Moon - the man in the moon is indifferent, so Chely turns to the woman in the moon for adviceSea of Cowboy Hats - very energetic, excellent honkeytonkin' tuneI Love You Enough - quintessential country tuneNobody But a Fool - excellent faster country songHe Don't Do Bars Anymore - Chely has won guy away from barsLast Supper - Chely sets the supper table real nice as a send off to hubby who's running around and cheating."
3,Not enough detail,The training was OK - I wanted it to be fabulous! I have been using Acrobat through the last 4 versions and wanted more in-depth training than the CD set provided. I did get information out of the training but wanted MORE! I think for $170 the training should have been more in-depth.
3,"Money, money, and more money","If you ever wanted to know how a department store got it's conception, or how New York City became the money city of the U.S. this is the book for you. From what I read in this book, it was really interesting but it can get so boring with all the details. If you are an economics major - this is the book for you."
1,Disappointing,"I thought this book would have a lot more to offer. Is not at all interesting, but rather wordy and heavy to follow."
5,One of Callas' greatest late recitals,"Each Callas recital offers some exquisite beauties and fascinating insights. Yet her early Verdi-Recital in 1958 fulfils the promise her complete live recording of Macbeth brought to life. Callas sings the Lady's arias with fierce ardour while being a regal and moving Elisabetta. There are several great Verdi-Recitals, among them the sublime Verdi-Recitals by Montserrat Caballe but this one will always be special."
1,Smooth slippery bottle makes this a very ill designed produc,"The stuff inside seems to work great, but after the heavy smooth jar slipped from my damp fingers ( hey, it's an after shave?) hit my sink on it's tumble to the floor, each impact producing a thin, sharp,sliver, one of which I found the hard way, I have to say that the marketing genius who designed this bottle ought to be dope slapped with a cow liver.This is the first glass jar product I ever bought from Nivea, and I guess my last, at least for an after shave."
4,Great for kids,"This is actually a darling little book - perfect to give to young owners. Hints on housebreaking, training, etc.And, as a bonus - 4 detachable post cards at the back.I'd buy them now while they are available- will really be a neat collectible in the years to come."
3,Not the right author,"I have to agree with another reviewer that person who wrote this book does not seem to have a deep knowledge of the subject. I picked up this book in order to study for GRE CS subject test and it was just a general refresher and was not complete so i had to use my networking book from college. If you just want a quick rewiew of some concepts, then it is a right book for you, but anything semi complex is not covered or covered with not enough datails in this book."
3,MORE INFO,I think the author lacks a graduate degree(at least an M.S.) incomputer science or electrical engineering. Schaum's could haveselected an Accademic to produce a better Networking book thathas examples of Protocol computer code and Sockets.
4,The book will haunt you!,"Morrison's heart wrenching novel tells the story of an entire town from a child's perspective. Morrison mixes elements of racism, poverty, and human fragility into a vivid tragedy. The child's voice becomes the consience that the society appears to lack. Morrison resists simplifying the characters or creating villains and heroes. We think this book should be taught to more mature students in high school."
5,the best book,"of all of morrison's books, i like this one the best (though it seems to be her least read one). anyway, the tragedies that pecola breedlove suffers opens the readers eyes to the true darkness of hopelessness. this is one of the saddest books i've ever read, but it is one that everyone should read."
4,Very Good.,I had heard so much about Toni Morrison and decided to read The Bluest Eye. She did a wonderful job on revealing the double marginalization of Black women. And how they in their pain and despair cannot help but inflict pain upon their daughters. The Bluest Eye displays the impact of slavery on the Black individual. Absolutely Wonderful.
5,The Bluest Eye,"It is the story of a young girl who wanted more then anything to have blue eyes. She yearns to have the feelings of the all-American blonde haired blue eyed white girl who has a priveledged life. Pecola is a poor, homely, black girl living with her parents in the south. She has alwyas been treated less tehn everyone else in society, even other black girls because she is ugly. This story is of the nightmare at the heart of her yearning and the tragedy of its fulfillment.I loved this book. I recommend it for females over the age of 13. It will touch your heart and make you feel sympathy for the characters. You will get to know them so well, and you will feel their pain, suffering, and cherish the moments with them. You will want to help them perservere and triumph over the rough times. Please, take my word for it, this is a great book that everyone should experience."

5,A True Classic,"I remember reading this book my senior year in high school; my teacher kept reminding us that this was Toni Morrison's *first* book. It was hard to believe then and still is. Although Ms. Morrison has gone on to write many more beautiful and powerful books and win the Nobel prize, this one is still my favorite. I think it is because of the characters -- the four young girls who make up the juxtaposed visions of what is beautiful, what is good, what is desired. It is also simply a powerfully moving story. Part of what makes it so good is the insights we see of ourselves as individual people and as a people. Pecola Breedlove haunts us still, and perhaps she always will."
2,Down and out,"...Frankly, it would be hard to find a more hopeless, depressing, dark novel. There is no redemption here for any of these afflicted characters. There is only sorrow, nihilism, and desperation. As a portrait of such it is well written, but yikes. I don't mind a book being depressing, but I like to find some shred of hope for change or life affirmation even among the suffering, and I do not find it here."
1,MEDIOCRE,I guess that I am just not a Toni Morrison fan. I have tried without success to read and enjoy all her books. This book is comparable to Beloved in that they both are slow paced and fail to capture the heart and soul of the reader.
1,Well-- reading their own press,"Toni Morrison must be reading her own press. This book is terrible. No plot,no characters of note. Just meandering with her own words pontificating. Come on. This isn't writing, this is self-indulgence."
1,don't believe the hype,"I tried giving this book a chance but was sorely disappointed. It just made me feel guilty just cos I'd been born white. You know, I know blacks have had a hard time in this world...I'm not naive...but there's a right and wrong way to tell us about your problems. This book is an example of the wrong way. To me it came off as preachy and heavy-handed. And I don't care how many awards a book wins...that doesn't mean I should automatically like it."
4,EXCELLENT--MUST READ!,The Bluest Eye is excellent--definitely a must read. You will laugh and cry. Feed your soul and food for thought.
5,Great,"This book is heart wrenching. It truly makes you reflect on yourself and your values. The setting is simple, but the characters grab you in to the story. This book confronts the issue of racial identity and pride, as well as how beauty is perceived. This is definitely a must read."
3,"Not my kind of book, but maybe yours....","I thought cause it was Oprah's favourite and because it was one of the book club, it would be a good book. It is, but if you're native language isn't english like me, than you will have a hard time with the slang words etc. Next to it, you have to want to read about the past, racism etc."
3,OOOOOPS Toni - This one missed the mark,"I am glad to learn that this is Toni's first book because, quite frankly, I did not like it. I am sure that my lack of intellectual prowess contributes to my dismay. Nonetheless, I wish she had not written this book. Maybe over time, with some luck, I will gain some intellect and as a result better understand why Toni elected to pen this disaster.Nothwithstanding, I do know that the "" White- queen-goddess"" was hoisted upon the Black race through slavery and can understand why Toni may want to address that misnomer in this tome. But, that is the only thing I can think of that she may have had in mind that would be of any literary value. The fact that she somewhat apologizes, to some degree, later in her writing career for this book, makes me feel justified in my analysis.(...)"
5,A tragic and beautifully written story...,"I read this book in college many years ago and loved it. Although I am a white, middle-class woman, I could relate to the story. Everyone wants a happy ending, and I think Toni Morrison is able to show the gruesome reality of hatred and abuse within the family unit and in our socitey. It made me take a look at myself and others in a different way. In a way, it taught me to appreciate my perceived ""ugliness"" and turn it into something positive."
3,Interesting and Insightful,"The Bluest Eye, by Toni Morrison, is a novel that takes place in the early 20th century. Morrison writes the novel through the eyes of a young girl who yearns to have blue eyes to fit in with the ""beautiful people"" of the era. In the girl's eyes the beautiful people are the white people around her. In addition to the young girl wanting to fit in, the novel tells shows the lives of the people around her to give the reader an idea of how life was at this time. Although the novel is perceived to be easy reading, the reader has to somewhat read between the lines to get a full understanding of the novel. Overall the novel is very interesting and insightful."
2,Depressing book,"Morrison writes well, but why she chose to use her skills to write this hopeless bummer is beyond me. Harsh reality, sure. But why read it if there is no hope, no concept of hope, no reason for hope, none whatsoever?"
2,Disappointment In The Bluest Eye,"I was very disappointed in this novel. I found it incredibly depressing, or perhaps it was the fact that my class read this novel right after September 11th. I felt bad for the main character, Pecola, and the incredible pain and sorrow and suffering she endured throughout the book. However, I feel Toni Morrison *overdid* the pain and suffering a bit. One thing after another after another kept on happening to her, resulting in one of the most depressing works I have ever opened and read from cover to cover. I cannot see, nor do I believe I will *ever* see how this was an award-winning novel. Sorry Miss Morrison, but you flopped on my list."
4,Beautifully written,"I bought and read The Bluest Eyes yesterday at the bookstore and today it was announced as Oprah's new pick. I have read and enjoyed Toni Morrison before so I was anxious to read this short story. I was not disappointed and did not go to sleep until the book was finished. What struck me in the story is that beyond the prejudice of color the characters lives are all touched by some element of ""being looked down upon."" All the characters face the pain of not being respected and treated decently by others. Pecola unfortunately happens to be the one that is at the bottom of the heap so to speak. This story touched me because so often people look for the ""ugly"" in others to make themselves feel better and don't stop to think how deeply hurtful that is to others. Haven't we all wished for something to make us more beautiful, more loved like Pecola who dreams that merely changing the color of her eyes would change the direction of her life."
4,"Okay book, amazing author","This book is okay...personally, I would recommend something else by Toni Morrison. It has a lot of sexual scenes in it, and some swearing, which might be offending to some people but to most is really no big deal. The author has an incredible writing style, awesome way of describing things, and is just over all brilliant. I actually thought that the last page and the afterword were the best parts of the entire book, because it made me appreciate the book more and made me realize that it actually was a really cool novel. I have never read anything else by Toni Morrison but I would in a heartbeat. Give this book a chance and see what you think."
3,Educational....,"Our book club picked The Bluest Eye to read because Oprah had said it was her favorite book club pick. I really did not enjoy reading this book but was forced to finish it because of my book club obligation. Although this book made me extremely uncomfortable, I am glad I read it. I have read a few of Oprah's picks and they always depress me but they are stories that I would not normally pick myself and they always show me a side of life that I have not experienced. It was very moving book and has left a deep impression in my mind. Our book club has come to the determination that that is Oprah's goal to open our minds and show us what is going on outside our protected lives."
2,Much ado about nothing,"Morrison is a gifted spinner of words, producing works that bring beauty and unforgettable imagery to the reader. But in ""The Bluest Eye"" it was, for me, all for naught. Because for nearly all the novel I alternated between being disgusted, confused, or simply bored (who is Soaphead and why do I care? Who is talking here? Where is the narrator? Not more urine!) I feel that the story was as much Claudia and Freida's as Pecola's, yet, sadly, in the end I cared nothing for any of them."
4,Excellent novel,"I needed to read this book for an College English Course on 21st Century Writers. Although, I was provided with a hard copy of the book for my course, I elected to purchase it on CD so I could listen to it during my work commute. It was excellent, however it is an abridged version, therefore the narration does skip parts of the novel. Overall, I thought it was great :)G. RileyTennessee"
4,Deeper than descriptive words,"""The Bluest Eye"" strikes me (almost literally) with the true ""ugliness"" of ignorance and in doing so, clarifies the utterly ridiculous nature of considering someone (of any race) ugly for genetically-derived physical features.Morrison's words assault the reader with the fact that life during the 40's in poor areas was dismal. Her work is filled with harsh realities and gritty descriptions of everyday life. The characters do not get the happy ""Hollywood"" ending. But her story of Pecola is not nauseating.It is society that is guilty of brandishing such hurtful ideas. And in this story, we are shown how it destroys the life of a twelve year old girl."
2,Can you say confusing?,"Picked this book upon hearing good things, only to discover a story that is poorly weaved together and disturbing at times. Definitely would have been better if Morrison had focused on one point of view, but instead jumps around, making whom is speaking difficult to dicipher."
3,"not her best, but important for Morrison fans to read","I'm surprised at the hostility towards Morrison's first novel. I've read and taught almost all her later novels (Song of Solomon, Sula, Beloved) which are much better, but it's worth reading the Bluest Eye to see where Morrison has come from and where she was going. In fact, it's one of the more interesting projects for any author/s: read their later masterpieces and then go back and read their very first published work. One can at least see the power of her writing and her vivid descriptions which come back in a much more mature form in Beloved. Morrison has grown a lot since 1970, and if you read her own feelings about the novel (posted in the critical reviews), you'll see that she herself would probably only give 2-3 stars to this book. Still, as an early novella and certainly her most accessible book, read it as an introduction to her later and better works."
4,Disturbing,"If there is any novel that is a kaleidoscope of emotions: pain, love, hatred--this is it. If there is any novel that is exquisite and disturbing, it is this novel. It is the story of a little girl that doesn't know how to love herself and is therefore uncapable of loving. Her environment is one of violence and pain and longing. She longs to be loved. I found myself wanting to actually reach out to her and hug her, to show her what love is like. It is a shame that she is never aware how truly wonderful love can be and how it can make her feel--how it can make her self-hatred and low self esteem evaporate. The language--as I always find in Toni Morisson's writing--is beautiful but subtle. The plot is not hard to grasp and stretches itself wonderfully throughout the book. Truths are told; things that society needed to hear then and still need to hear now. But I warn you: this book will rip your heart out."
4,Another Masterpiece by Toni,This was a great but simple read by Toni. It was moving and captivating. I found it easy to follow and passed it on to my teenage daughter. You would want to read this one on the porch swing.
4,Touching,"This book was interesting. It draws you in, and you yearn to know what happens with this little girl. I thought this was a really good book."
3,not morrison's best work,"I chose to read the book, The Bluest Eye, by Toni Morrison, because I had read her short story, Recitatif, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The Bluest Eye was well-written, creative, and thoughtful. However, I thought it was a bit hard to get into. There was so much stuff going on, so many different perspectives to take into account, that at times it got a bit confusing for me. Although I would recommend this book to others, I don't think it is her best work."
5,One of My Favorites,"I read The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison in one sitting. I was hooked from the first page by the author's beautiful prose, a sing-song melody of the written word that I have never before or since experienced from another author's work. Then came the story, a heartbreaking tale of a young black girl who wants to be someone she is not, blonde haired and blue eyed because of how she sees herself, how others talk about her ugliness and worst of all, how she is violated by her own flesh and blood. I was so moved by this book; the words stayed with me long after I put it down. I highly recommend The Bluest Eye to anyone with a taste for beautifully written prose, something unlike anything you've ever read before and a tragic, all too realistic tale. This one goes at the top of my list."
4,Sad,"The Bluest Eye made me sad. The cruelty and injustice embedded in Pecola's world was difficult to witness. This child had no where, except her fantasy, to turn for the reaffirmation we all seek. I think it is one of Toni Morrison's best works, but it still makes me sad, probably because it echoes reality in all too many instances."
2,Where is the redemption?,"I've just read MANY of the reader reviews for this novel. Why does no one mention the terrible beating poor Pecola got from her mother because her father raped her? I think that beating had as much to do with Pecola's ""losing her mind"" as everything else she suffered combined. In essence, she was raped by both her parents. I don't disagree that Ms. Morrison writes with a marvelous style about compelling life themes. But I find no redemption or healing in this novel (nor in her others I've read). Evil is not overcome. The conclusion is dark, lacking in hope. I'm an idealist, and thankfully, I see life filled with redemption and healing, even for horrendous circumstances. I only read Morrison when I have to (and I read this novel for a book club). I regret her view of life in so many of her novels is so overwhelmingly negative, especially since she's such a powerful and influential writer."
2,Written Child Porn,"It has been a while since I read this book, but I recently was involved in a discussion about this Toni Morrison novel, so I've decided to write a review:The book has some brilliant moments, no doubt. But all and all this novel reads like a fifth-grader wrote it, and contains an extremely graphic rape scene between a man and a little girl. This novel, just like The Catcher In The Rye, is nothing but an attempt to write a story for people who love to see negativity and pessimism glorified. A play for that ""woe-is-me"" crowd of ""LEFTIST"" morons. An easy target to shoot for. If you want to become a famous novelist, just use the Lord's name in vain, over and over again, or describe how you hate the world because it has let you down.Like I said, there are a few parts of this novel I think are great. But there is so much more of it that is just disgusting, whining, and needless complaining. Toni Morrison is the most overrated writer in America today...www.therunnninggirl.com"
1,"Come on, Oprah...","This book was a waste of my time. Oprah had me believing this book was about a black girl named Pecola and how she thought that if she only had blue eyes, then everyone would love her. Instead, I read about incest, domestic violence, prostitutes, alcoholics, nasty-behaving white racists, and home after pathetic home with not a trace of love anywhere. This book is depressing and confusing. Maybe someone should tell Oprah to lighten things up a bit...and no more Toni Morrison!"
1,Endured rather than read,"Granted I am a guy, a white guy at that, but a relatively evolved and enlightened one (or so my wife says when not pummeling me with a rolling pin). However, when assigned to read this for a woman's literature class in art school, I began visualizing forms of torture I would rather endure than finish this book. Call me a simpleton, but bare minimum, a book has to have a PLOT! If there is a guy out there who can choke down this book without bleeding from the eyes, the first round of medicinal post-read bourbon is on me. Sorry...for what it's worth, though, I loved Fried Green Tomatoes and Joy Luck Club"
4,One of the best books I read.,This book had kept me wondering what the next chapter would be.At the end of a Chapter I had gathered all my Information on that one chapter in a part of my head to get ready to read the next amazing chapter!This Book should go to a mature teenager and is a Good book for older teens.And Yes i do like to randomly capitalize Words =)
1,The Bluest Eye,"I thought The Bluest Eye was very boring & hard to follow. I tried reading it in large print because that was all the library had when I checked it out. It took me 2 weeks to read half way through it and I don't remember anything about this child wishing for blue eyes. Half way through I gave up on it. I have never read any other Toni Morrison novel, and if this is her best book, I am not interested in reading them any of them."
1,what people see vs. what was written,While people like to make themselves seem intelligent by over-analyzing the book and reading things into it that Morrison never intended. What is actually between the covers of the book is 150 pages of the gross aspects of sex and femine hygene. That is not what makes brillant writing.
4,You don't want to miss this one...,"This easy-to-read novel, The Bluest Eye written by Toni Morrison, grabbed my attention only five minutes after I started reading it. The descriptive manner that Morrison used to tell the story is very touching.It is a story of 11-year old Pecola Breedlove who is faced with hatred and racism everyday. To others, she is considered ugly and looked down upon because of her dad's past. Her only wish is for blue eyes, so she too can be beautiful."
2,A Major Disappointment,"I was anxious to read this book, I know Oprah loved it and I heard alot of great reviews. So I started it and was disappointed right away. This book, like most books, didn't get my interest right away. It also didn't hold my interest like other books. I found my mind wandering so I would have to go back and reread certain passages. Then when I finished the book I was disappointed. What was the point of this book? I read this whole book and didn't get anything from it. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone and will make sure I never read this book for a second time."
3,It invokes emotions,"The plight of a black young girl, pieced together by a few characters appeared to be the central plot in the book, but the whole story was so much more than just that. It was about the culture, the history, the prejudices in Africa. It gave an insight on how these had affected the characters¡ feelings, emotions and behaviour. The book was beautifully written but at the same time so intense that it invoked in me bitterness, sympathy and sadness."
4,Lyrical Poetry,"The language of this book engaged me from beginning to end. The story is about humans becoming. Peccola is merely the recipient of all that has been handed down - her ugliness, her self loathing. I found the different points of view challenging. She draws the characters as complex beings, rather than one-dimensional monsters.If your looking for a happy ending, keep looking. Though Ms. Morrison admits to some faults in her afterword, the story moves and teaches, the most we could ask of any story teller."
1,The worst book I have ever read!,"I don't know if its just me, but this was simply the worst book I have ever read. I normally enjoy the ""Oprah's Book Club"" selections, however I found this selection disjointed, uninteresting and hard to follow. Knowing that this was the #1 paperback at the time that I purchased the book, I continually forced myself to keep reading the book because I thought that it would get better. It never did! I was so frustrated by the end that I had to tell someone about it!"
3,A Response,"Of all of Morrison's novels, The Bluest Eye is not one of myfavorites. However, The Bluest Eye is a compelling novel that forcesthe reader to examine how they feel about issues no one wants to face. Thank goodness for Toni Morrison, a woman that isn't afraid to write what needs to be written."
4,A Beautiful Book,"I first read this book a few years ago and was surprised by the power and beauty in Morrison's words. After reading the book again, I am again struck by how much she can say in this little book. Pecola is a pathetic figure that makes one truly question their place in the world. The idea that to be beautiful one must look a certain way is an idea Pecola struggles with every day in her search for ""the bluest eyes"" as many of us in today's world also struggle to be happy with our identities. I enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend reading it."
3,A Response,"Of all of Morrison's novels, The Bluest Eye is not one of my favorites. However, The Bluest Eye is a compelling novel that forces the reader to examine how they feel about issues no one wants to face. Thank goodness for Toni Morrison, a woman that isn't afraid to write what needs to be written."
2,Powerfully depressing,"I have seldom felt as depressed as I did the day I finished reading ""The Bluest Eye""; not because I was sad it was finished, but because it is simply an overwhelmingly depressing book. So, if you are fond of books that make you feel this way, you will love it. Personally I hated it for this reason, but I give it an extra star because at least it made me feel at all."
2,She won for this book?,"A novella or a collection of vignettes? No plot, just a theme, incestuous sexual abuse among unfortunate African-Americans in the mid 20th century, and childhood anecdotal reminisces, didn`t satisfy me. Though filled with wonderfully creative metaphors and similes that were worth applauding, poetic writing simply does not suffice for story. Maybe one day Pecola, Claudia, or Pauline might be fleshed out and made the heroine of a novel with beginning, middle, and climax, which will intrigue with its complexities, but 'Blue' was more like reading a writer's notebook containing sketches of potential characters for future novels. I've read other books by T. Morrison that were hung on a plot... like The Song of Solomon and Paradise, which I would recommend to readers who want more."
2,not the best deal,"Book was in good condition as the seller stated, but the pages are yellowing from age which makes me think I payed way too much for it. It also took forever to be delivered. I ordered several things off Aamazon that day and every seller managed to get me my orders within a week in a halfor sooner, this order took over 3 weeks. I needed this book for a class, and barely got it in time."
5,The unbelievable first effort from a modern master,"Nothing can evoke our sympathies like an abused and alone child. The Bluest Eye investigates the effects of racism and poverty on the most vulnerable and the most impressionable. Morrison here is at her psychological best, keeping her focus on the life of Pecola, while conveying the brokenness of the child's world view. As a result, The Bluest Eye is among the most accessible of Morrsion's long fiction and an excellent introduction to this national treasure."
3,The bluest Eye...the Bluest Voice.,"I was amazed at how quickly I was drawn into Tony Morrison's The Bluest Eye. I found the characters interesting and educational... as I have never read a book from a poor black childs point of view. This story's core lies with the western worlds ideoligical view of beauty and acceptance. More so, how the two must be interwoven for one to have a successful life. It was when the protagonist (a little black girl talking about blonde-haired blue eyed children) stated ""What made people look at them and say, ""awwwww,"" but not for me?"" that I realized this goes for most of us.I, however, did not like reading about a father having sex with his daughter. Further, I did not like how the author described the rape; the rape was almost justafiable through the fathers eyes. ..or shall I say explainable."
4,Not just the colours of ya face but ya soul,"This is the first work of Toni Morrison i read after experienced her Noble acceptance marvellous lecture:the dancing mind. The bluest eye is truly inspiring and moving but without ridiculus pro black arguments. Morrison burns the racist in everyone of us, for each one of us are black in a sense. But going further,this is a literary piece of art. Through a child eyes, Morrison takes us by the hand to the most inocent and perverse thoughts every human being has. Origins of violence and dispair, the bluest eye make you think and feel. It is not sentimental it is sensous and bright. As her writer.Read it please.She's the greatest american writer alive. By far."
4,Unforgettable,"I read this book for a class in college. Ms. Morrison is amazing in that she had so many layers in this book, so many things that are hinted at and almost unseen. Also, the racism portrayed in this book also hit a strong point in me-- as an Asian American, I know what it is to have that much self-hatred at such a young age. It is bitter, without hope, and depressing, but it wakes people up and hopefully makes them think ""why"". I read this book two years ago and it has not left me since. The language is beautiful, and although the layout of the chapters was harder to understand, the history (and hence depth) of the characters make the whole book understandable."
4,Mental Mishaps,TBE was a well written book. Toni Morrison did a wonderful job conveying the sad happenings that unrealistic standards set by society can have on young African-American women. I give it four stars because the morals of the book could have been conveyed without the [violation] of Pecola and the other mental mishaps that the other characters went through.
5,Easily one of the best books I've ever read!!,"Ms. Morrison is pure genius! She can capture the spirit of a human being like few others. I am always in awe of what she writes. I loved ""Song of Solomon"" and ""Love"" also, but ""The Bluest Eye"" will always hold a very special place inside me.Cindy Boydauthor of Letting the Dog Outwww.lettingthedogout.com"
1,Disturbing book,"Let me begin by saying that I am an educated caucasian woman with a masters degree. I live in a town that has many African Americans, many of whom are close friends of mine. I was forced to read this book in an undergraduate literature class, and since then I have never been able to get this disturbing book out of my head. Bravo to Toni Morrison for being such an excellent writer, for a bad writer couldn't have stirred up such horror in me. I do not criticize her writing talent as much as I do her subject matter. It was horribly graphic and left me with a very disturbing feeling every time I read it. In fact, we were instructed to write a paper on this book and I refused. I spoke with the professor and was given permission to write about another book. Again, Toni Morrison is a brilliant writer. However this book left me with nothing but hurt."
2,Depressing,"It was my first time reading something by Toni Morrison, and was sad to say that this book was very depressing, it jumped around alot, and she was overly descriptive. I wasn't sure if I was reading about snow capped mountains or the wicks of candles, when she used to convey different things about the way a person appeared, it was very distracting. The moral of the story was true to life and sad. I would not recommend this book."
3,The Bluest Eye,"In the novel The Bluest Eye, by Toni Morrison, the text evadesmany themes that develop throughout the book. The novel does a goodjob of developing the themes, such as hope, racism and coming of age. Pecola Breedlove, an 11yr. old girl, grew up in a neighborhood where racism was much more vigilant that current day racism. Pecola encountered many grotesque experiences throughout her life. An abusive father that raped and empregnated her was just one of the many examples of the coming of age theme. Pecola would pray and hope for blue eyes everyday of her life.The text dragged at various times in the book but still kept my attention by the use of depression description of the book. Personally, I thought that the novel compared to the novel Avalon. Both books similarly give specifics on the theme of hope. Pecola hopes to gain the acceptance of her society and the book Avalon describes the hardships of struggling family trying to find the perfect place to stay in their new home, America."
1,too depressing to finish,"i always finish reading a book, even if it's rubbish. but i quit a third of the way thru. i didn't need to hear any more sexual abuse descriptions. otherwise i felt it was a well written book.not anti-white. it highlights important issues.thanks for listening."
3,good,"I think this is my least favorite of Tony Morrison's books. I like the simplicity, but it seems to lack the layers that I love about her writing."
2,Not As Good As Expected,"I guess it's the hype of being an Oprah book that caused me to make the purchase, though I first read the online reviews to determine whether it was a worthy read. I am not black, but I do have blue eyes. I understood the story as it was written, but I was disappointed with Oprah's choice - that this novel was another black history and oppression story we have to read about again. Let's move forward."
1,Displeased,"Have read many of Oprah's choices for book of the month and thoroughly enjoyed almost all of them. This was not one of them. The book was redundant, repeating the same story, through different people's lives, yet providing very little insight into those lives. With the constant changing of viewpoints, the characters remained undeveloped and vague. I wanted to know more and yet less also. The book was a disappointment with lots of potential, just too much garbage. Much preferred ""What looks like Crazy, on an Ordinary Day."" The content was also sad, but the characters found inner strength and persevered, unlike Morrison's character that goes insane."
2,Very Disappointing!,This book was a complete letdown! I have read and thoroughly enjoyed all of the other books by Toni Morrison but this one din't do it for me! I had a very hard time getting through to the end. Do not reccomend it to anyone! I only give it 2 stars because of it being written by Morrison. I am so glad she matured in her writng style as years went by.
2,Bleak,"Wanna get bummed out? Read this well-written but hopeless downer about racism, rape, vomit, and suffering, with no redemption for anyone and no possibility of change. Ye gods."
3,Well-wrought,"The Bluest Eye is a very well written portrayal of a child who is without a semblance of parental love, goodness or guidance and the vagaries of the community within which she lives. This black child focuses on the attainment of blue eyes, evidently society's standard of perfection to her, as the ""passport"" to all she so desperately desires in her arid life. The reader is introduced to many well-conceived characters while getting to know Pecola. This book left me thinking about the many kindnesses we all do and do not demonstrate to each other in this world...and how much the smallest kindness is treasured by the recipient. Toni Morrison makes her readers think and feel, and that is always the sign of a first-rate author."
3,Worth the effort,"One of Morrison's best novels, it is worth the effort. If you take the time and think about the messages and meanings of the book, how it deals with society's view of beuty and what that means to each of us, then it is definitly a treasure.Morrison's style is difficult for many, her naratives tend to fly around and it takes work as well as knowledge that she will tie all the ribbons together by the end. But this is one of her most clear books. Her easiest, that I've read, is Song of Soloman. Once you figure out her style her books become very lyrical and extreamily mentally rewarding."
4,The idea of beauty,"I really enjoyed this novel. Morrison creates many interlocking stories that join together to create a masterpiece. Pecola's idea of beauty and her desire to be beautiful through having blue eyes creates a powerful message about the treatment and class of blacks during this time. She is considered ugly by everyone above her, and she feels the only way to change her ugliness is to have something all of the others have: Blue Eyes. This compelling story brings tears to your eyes from the treatment these young girls endured. I really liked this book."
2,"Lofty message, but the delivery falls short","This first novel is a brave attempt to describe the longing for happiness through beauty, as perceived by a black child in miserable circumstances. Miss Morrison links this longing to the disadvantage of race, but I think it is a desire that is universal. Ugliness, misery, poverty, and incest are not limited to a specific race. The fragmented thread of the story unfortunately took away the power of the author's message.However, Miss Morrison more than compensated readers with subsequent works like 'Beloved' and 'The Song of Solomon'."
4,Scattered emotions!!!,"When reading this novel, 'The Bluest Eyes' by Toni Morrison, my emotions became scattered like the structure of the book. I kept turning the pages waiting for the hope that would come, but never did. The beginning of the book sets you up for the devastation to come, but when it finally hit your outraged twice over. The tragedy comes and there is nothing you can do to stop it and you feel helpless. I think that Toni Morrison left you with no hope, because hope is something that you have to find on your own. You can not sit around and wait for it to come to you. You have to search and fight for hope or you will end up like Mr. and Mrs. Breedlove with no hope and unfulfilled dreams to hand down to your children."
4,The cruelest emotion: Self-hatred,"Although the writing was not as strong as some of Morrison's other works; i.e, Song of Solomon and Beloved, The Bluest Eye is thematically very strong. The main character deeply suffers from extreme self-loathing and Morrison carries out the effects of racial discrimination to the ultimate degree. The book resonated in this reader's mind for days afterward."
2,This book was more than awful,I read this book and was so upset. It had a very hard and painful theme and should not have been touted so highly. I really was sad and depressed after reading this so called novel. Why so unhappy and painful?
1,Perverted -- yes. Literature -- no.,"I taught it one year in my AP Lit class because the teacher before me had already chosen it. It is not literature. The only reason it received its accolades is because our society mistakes ""shocking"" for ""profound"". The two are not the same. Graphic descriptions of children being incestuously raped does not make a book profound or deep or meaningful. It can make it perverted, however -- especially when the relativistic message is that we should all come to understand and empathize with those poor rapists, hookers, and sexually perverted preachers, etc. It's all stereotype and cliche, not at all well written. Sorry, I'm interested in real literature."
1,Sell Out,"I feel that this book, although written before Oprah started making millionaires, is still part of the big Toni Morrison sell out story. She's given up what's made her a great writer to be popular, and that's sad."
1,this book is garbage,white bashing at its best Im sick and tired of whites being blamed for blacks behavior start taking responsibility for your own peoples actions this book is trash I would rather clean the toilet than suffer through another morrison garbage read
2,Depressing,"This book is well written, in that it gives an uncompromising portrait of a sad life of poverty, racism, and rape. But that's all. There is no hope here. None. Not a scrap. We might as well all give up. What good can this book do for anyone?"
4,reply to the april 15th 2002 reviewer,"I'd just like to advise the person who thought that T.M. can't write to please take a good look at his review, and tell the world how one can be so stupid as to enter such a piece (for everyone to read!!), criticizing and insulting a writer,but not noticing that he is ridiculing himself by misspelling every second word!! Maybe that explains why Tony M.'s great writing can not be appreciated by this person."
1,MOST REPULSIVE BOOK EVER,"I had to read this book for 9th grade english. It was so terrible. Half the time someone is having sex or being rapped. I never saw any of the good things about this book, and when I told my english teacher about the book(she has never read it) she told me to write a letter to the school board to have them remove it from the list. So thats what I am doing. I cant believe how much sex was in this book. Dont give this book to people under 16! Its sooooooo dirty!"
1,I'd rather clean my bathroom........,"I have read other books written by Toni Morrison, and they have all been really good stories (Sula was awesome), but this one.....not so good. I felt that the book was a jumbled mess. To me, the story seemed not to be about Pecola Breedlove, but more about the other characters. I understand that each character, in relation to Pecola, had a story to tell, but I never got to KNOW her. Soaphead Church did not deserve to have a whole chapter written about him, when he ONLY had a few lines of dialog with her. I must admit, though, that Ms. Morrison's use of description is superb and it allows a reader to form the story within their head. Oh, wait, one more thing, I found the book to be a wee bit boring. The first chapter grabs you, but after a while, it's a chore to read the rest. I hate to say, she is such a good writer, but this book I would pass on."
4,sad but true,"Morrison's novel may be dramatic in the approach of this issue in recent readers' eyes because in today's society, but it is true that during the time that the novel was written that many young girls went through the issues described in this novel. The issues presented in the novel are presented both eloquently and accurately. I have noticed that some people believe that Morrrison is soley blaming white americans for the problems that the main character is experiencing, but in my opinion that is not the case. I believe she is advidly pointing out the idea that society has deemed more superior. This is a fault of both blacks and whites in society. So I do not feel that anyone should be offended by the author's words because they do not lay blame upon one race of people, but with society as a whole. On a different note I feel that the novel is very well written and the characters really reach the heart of the readers."
2,Not ...,"After reading ""Beloved"", I tried really hard to like this book, but just couldn't. I was so relieved when it ended. As other reviewers suggest, it is disjointed, boring in parts, and simply not a very good read. I'd encourage readers to try other Morrison books though, she has come a long way since this one."
2,Disappointing,"I read this after hearing wonderful things about Toni Morrison's writing and knowing that she had been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. I was very disappointed.I found very few redeeming qualities in the book and I had to consciously force myself to finish it. That is rarely the case with most books that I have read, and I only continued with it in the hopes that the book would start getting better. It never did.I did not find her story telling very compelling, I formed little interest or emotional attachments to the characters, and the crafting of words was nothing special. All in all, not a very memorable book.I do not know if this book is representative of Toni Morrison's entire body of work -- perhaps it is not. But, if it is, then I can honestly say there is little chance that I will read anything else by her again."
2,Nothing Earth-Moving,"I must admit, I truely wanted to believe Morrison's book would be a good book. Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed. Other than Morrison's poetic nature, I didn't see anything that unique or profound. It was simply OK. This was the second chance I gave Morrison in winning me over. The first attempt at reading Jazz was a horrific undertaking. (Even Oprah doesn't try to defend it.) But still, I wanted to enjoy her work and tried The Bluest Eye. The only difference was that at least it was coherent and I could follow the plot. Personally, I find her interviews much more rich and fascinating. She should try writing a non-muddled autobiography."
1,did not understand,"i thought that this book was pretty much ok, i liked her use of words, but i didn't like her style. Overall i was very confused as to what the plot was"
5,GOOD,This book was really sad but really good this is the first book i really liked by Tonia Morisson this book is about a young girl named Pecola Breedlove who wants blues eyes because she is discriminated against from other people . she thinks if she has blue eyes her world will be all perfect this is a really good book just a warning though it will make u angry and it will also make u cry ......but it is really worth reading...
1,pretentious pornography,"Yeah, I really wasnted to read a pretentious, unrealistic book that culminated in a drunk guy raping his little daughter and the girl getting pregnant and going insane. Toni Morrison has no mastery over ther stream-of-consciousness technique, therfore, everything she writes sound fake and contrived. I'm not saying all books should be clean, or that they should all have clear plots and a classic narrative structure, I'm only asking that ifa writer deviates fromthe norn, they od it for a reason other than making themsleves look smart. Morrison has, to usea cliched but accurate phraser, the subtlety of a sledgehammer, whcih makes a less-than-bright reader feel smart and sophisticated when the can figure out the symbolism of an insane balck girl walking around flapping her arms. Hmmm, does she wish she could fly? Gee, I wonder.This is a stupid, rpetentious book, which may be why it has done so well on the bookclubs."
1,Not my cup of tea,This was my first venture with Toni Morrison. I have heard so much about her and people love her or don't. I am in the don't category. Her prose is too wordy and doesn't enhance the story.
5,Love this book!,"This is book is great and easy-to-read! My favorite have-to-read book for school, for sure. Though uncomfortable at times, I love Toni Morrison's writing style."
3,"Good message, but could have been stronger","In the past, I put off reading Toni Morrison because of her style of writing. I think that during the time, I might not have been ready for her style of writing since I was fairly young. But, recently, after hearing praises of it, i decided to give The Bluest Eye a chance. I must say that it was not as difficult as I thought it would be. As a matter of fact, it was fairly easy. The message of a young, black girl's struggle for beauty in a modern society was a common one, but I agree with a reader that mentioned that Morrison failed to emphasize on plot. Most of the story involved background information that was not really relevant to the main character, Pecola. I wished that Morrison would have revealed to the reader more of Pecola's thoughts to give the novel a stronger message. Nonetheless, Morrison is a gifted writer and the powerful message at the end of the plot is evidence of her brillance."
4,"Intelligent Book, Sensitive Subjects","I chose to read this novel for a feminst class that I had taken. I absolutly loved it. I enjoy how Morrison used the seasons of Pecola's life to document this story, it shows how children look at the important times in their life. I found this novel so interesting, but also sad. I think that Morrison writes in such a way that you can feel compassion for all the characters, even Cholly. I understood why he was so dysfunctional but it does not excuse his actions. The whole beauty theme is so important in our society today, the lenghs that young women go to be beautiful are both dangerous and unessasary, they can also destroy you. I also appriated the fact that Pecola did not really have a voice in this novel, everything we knew about her came from mostly Calduia. I wish for Pecola's sake the ending could have been different & she could have overcome all the obstacles in her way, but I know that would have defeated the purpose of this novel."
3,Serious subjects,"The Bluest Eye is a realistic account of what could happen to poor black children living in the deep south in the early 20th century. Toni Morrison includes many details, which are necessary to make the reader feel like he is in the setting. The subjects the book deals with are very serious and mature. I believe the book is overall a decent book as far as plot structure, description, and basic story imaginativity. But as far as liking the book, I didn't enjoy how everything was so sad, and depressing. But I am the type of person who likes more adventurous and exciting books. I am not sorry I read it."
3,The only Morrison I've been able to finish...,"Toni Morrison tends to get too wordy for my taste. She tends to loose me in her need to be artful in her writing. If this is her ""less mature"" writing, I prefer it. It was a really nicely written book about many sad characters. It was not a happy book in any way. It was a portrait of a time and of the people caught in that time. It was a very dark story- sober by design- and not something one would read at the beach for a little entertainment. If you are interested in issues that faced the black community then(and maybe still), it probably has some historical significance. A thought provoking, but clearly-not-for-everyone read."
5,Highland Lakes Book Club,"Our newly formed book club selected ""The Bluest Eye"" as our first book and, without exception, our members gave this book 5 stars. This is a powerful book that makes the reader examine their own hearts for their definition of what is beautiful. Comments from book club members include:""The main lesson I learned from the book is to focus on people and look beyond the surface layer.""""The beauty of the language was the one thing that kept me most involved in the book. Morrison is a true poet.""""The true magic of Morrison's writing is her ability to create memorable characters.""It is my sincere hope that our future selections will be as thought provoking and beautifully written as this book. I am certain that we will read more of this author."
5,A powerful story,"The Bluest Eye, the story of a young girl's tortured life, is not a story you can ""like"". It reads like your worst nightmares, very disturbing and very graphic. It takes a strong stomach to get through this novel. But, this is just what makes the book a masterpiece, that Ms Morrison can draw such powerful feelings from readers. Toni Morrison has grown as a writer. But this book, her first, takes you to a world most didn't know existed and evokes almost unbearably strong emotions. A must read for lovers of great literature. This is not a book you read for pleasure. It's a book you read for the power of the written word."
4,beautiful and/but very sad,"Like all of Morrison's work, Bluest Eye is beautifully crafted. It follows a more clearly linear path than most of her more recent writings. But (as is appropriate for its subject matter) it doesn't have the sense of redemption or spiritual uplift that graces much of her other books, especially Song of Solomon. Read it, learn from it and appreciate it, but don't count on it to cheer you up."
3,touched but not moved,"I so wanted to love this book. Oprah spoke of it in a way that I could not wait to read it. I started it a day that I was alone and I had the entire day to relish it. I must say I was disappointed and confused. I felt that the book told of too many characters and not all of them connected to Pecola. The character Soaphead Church disgusted me and I see no need for him in the story. I wanted to feel her desire for ""blue eyes"" but it seemed to just be grazed over. I was touched by the lives of these little girls but I was not moved by the story. I felt that there was alot of the story missing and I was yearning for it by the end of the book. I felt left hanging and sad with many questions unanswered."
3,The Bluest Eye,"Toni Morrison's book, although difficult to understand, is good.Oprah put it on her list and gave it a lot of attention--otherwisethis story may have been overlooked. I didn't particularly""enjoy"" this book; I don't care for the writing style and itmade me feel uncomfortable--but it did teach me a lesson. I seePecola in the mirror everyday, and more importantly, I see her in myclassroom. When are we going to realize beauty is not determined byeye color or the color of our skin or hair? It is not about whatclothes we wear or the size we fit into. This story did not have a""happy ending"".... And finally, it's a tremendous work ofliterary art, with Morrison hitting all the lyrical, indignant,sorrowful, scarifying notes as though this were her fifteenth and notfirst published work."
5,A Beautiful Novel with a Really Big Punch,"I am so tired of people bashing (and school boards banning) this novel because of it's graphic potrayals of incest, rape, and abuse and so called ""racial vulgarity"" (whatever that means). This book was published in 1970, when racial uphevial and tension in America was still very much a hailstorm sweeping the nation. It's a real portrayal of some very real problems in America.This novel is supposed to make you sick to your stomach; it's supposed to incite feelings of disgust, anguish, anger, and desperration. That's the whole point of the novel: to be a slap in the face; a sort of wake up call.The social problems protrayed in this book are very real (racism is still prevelant in America; anyone who thinks differently is walking around with their eyes closed), and banning books like this will not make the problems go away. It is books like The Bluest Eye that allow for dialogue to happen between people.It is a magnificant novel."
2,Not up to Small's standards,"This book opens well enough, but approximately two thirds of the story is sex and repetative explinations of why Rosamond and her lover cannot marry and why they are in San Lorenzo. Which in and of itself was of no real purpose whatsoever. To be honest, when the two are separated, I felt no anguish, as the relationship and characters during their love affair did nothing but have sex. I will say, that the last few chapters of the book picked up in intrigue and historical detail. These are the two things setting Small apart from other historical romance writers. Unfortunatly, this book for the most part lacks those elements. I am an avid reader of Small, and hope she returns to her earlier heights of historical romance writing."
3,"Good writing, but amazes me how the point of view is flawed","No one can say Small isn't a good writer, but...how does she manage to keep breaking point of view rules? I'd love for her to answer this, as I can't believe that she doesn't know differently. Flying into all the minds of the character in one scene is dizzy. As a result, I find the characterization weakened and I'm vaguely disappointed. I also didn't buy the whole first meeting scene...sorry, not real enough. Contrived. Cliched. But please, this is just one opinion, and no one can deny her talent. Maybe she DOES know she's breaking basic writer rules and doesn't care because she is who she is??"
2,Not one of Beatrice Small' s better books,"I love Beatrice Small's books but I can honestly say that this book is an exception. I felt that the heroine Rosemunde was a shallow character. She supposedly had this heart stopping love for Patrick Leslie and as soon as an osbstacle comes between the two, like loss of memory, she splits. Whatever, happened to that love that was going to last forever for Rosemunde, obviously she wasn't in love with Patrick Leslie that much. The guy she winds up finally marrying is a narcotic stalker. Definitely,not one of her better books."
2,Too Predictable,"Unfotunately, reading about Rosamund was like reading about Skye O'Malley all over again. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the O'Malley saga, I'm experiencing a certain ennui in having it repeated all over again. The descriptions of clothing and food in the ""Friarsgate"" series are practically verbatim those of the previous novels. I was looking forward to a refreshing new story line, but I've been disappointed by the obvious predictability. Perhaps Ms.Small will surprise me and excite with future sequels."
3,Not the best Bertrice Small has to offer,"In the sequel to Rosemaud the heroin falls in love with a much older man. (I will save the ending for those of you that did not spend $14 on this book.) She also is being chased by a man that needs to realize that it is not romantic to chase a woman that prefers anyone over you, that it just seems kind of desperate. The story did have some of the flair that I have come to expect from Bertrice Small, but the whole time I was reading this book I was hard pressed to find any part of the plot that felt like it really worked."
4,Until You Book 2,This was a great sequel to the firt book (Rosamund). The book was in good shape and I did not have to wait long for it to arrive. Maybe later I might get the next book in this sequel.
2,No More Leslies! Please!,"Having enjoyed Rosamund, I was looking forward to this sequel. However when the male love interest in the book turned out to be the oversexed Patrick Leslie, I threw the damn thing against the wall. Is it too much to hope for a fresh male character in a new book? Must characters like the Earls of Glenkirk be recycled ad nauseam? If you haven't read other books by Small, this might be fresh and fun. But if you've read about the Leslies as much as an avid fam would, you might very well throw the book against your own wall."
5,Couldn't stop and I haven't even gotten it yet...,"When I went to Wal-mart, I noticed this and checked it out. In the end I spent 15 minutes listening to 3 20 second clips over and over again! In love with Ireland and didn't know how cool Celtic music was. You can imagine someone singing this around a campfire and it's so soulful. Be honest, in some parts the accent was so thick I didn't have clue as to what the women were singing, but it didn't stop me from attempting to sing along! Awesome price, and good music when you want to just think about something. Highly recommend this. What am I saying? Buy this and spend as much time as possible enjoying it! My personal favorite was Maid Who Sold her Barley."
2,"Good, but slow","I've listened to a lot of celtic music throughout my short life, and my preference tends to be something more upbeat. The songs on this album are all excellent, but there are only a few that are not long, slow ballads."
4,Experimental dark metal,"I have to admit that it took a couple listens for me to get use to Rebel Extraganza. This album is far different from any of Satyricon's previous releases. The conceptual themes of past albums ""Shadowthrone"", and ""Dark Medeval Times"" are no longer present. Rebel is much more stripped down sound while maintaining a dynamic sound that sets Saytricon apart from it's Black Metal predecessors. My favorite songs would have to be ""Havok Vultures""( w/ a cameo from Ferniz or DarkThrone), ""Prime Evil Renaissance"", and the blast beat rythms of ""Supersonic Journey"". Rebel also includes a couple of subtle interludes in between songs, allowing you to rest before your senses get pummeled again with Satyricon's brand of Dark Metal. Most fans either hate or love this album. This albums an aquired taste.I myself listen to it with a sense of awe, as one may listen to symphony or orchestra music. Does it rock? Hell yeah! A must have for open minded metal fanatics."
4,Better than expected,"I will admit, I got into the whole ""black metal"" thing because I was dating a chick that was into it. She is gone. But the discs stay. These guys do have talent. It is apparent that they put some real thought into this album. The lyrics are more sound effect than anything else, but this works. The percussion is hyperactive, but, again, it works. The tempo shifts are a predictable as a Lake Superior gale, yet again, it works. My point: this album contains all the most predictable elements, but still is a total original blast. That requires talent. It is like a good sonnet, you know the structure ahead of time, but it still satisfies."
2,not to impressing,"this album is not to impressing. i bought Nemesis Divina, and didn't think it was the greatest. when i heard this one i was even more disappointed. all it is is really fast blast beats and crunchy riffs. the majority of it sounds the same and there is little atmosphere. much less than Nemesis. there are a few decent parts, but in a whole the album isn't great."
2,Turned awry,"This is definetely not a match for a great talent of Satyr. I am the greatest fan of their first works, especially ""Dark Medeival Times"", which is on of the best Black-Metal albums ever. This, however, is rather Death than Black. Gone are the nordic spirit, the darkness, the greatness."
1,More musical,"once again, another bad album from a band that once sat on top of the ""black metal"" world....dont waste your money....yeah its fast (if mindless speed impresses you more than quality...)and there are some great parts, but for the most part, the album is a blend of all sorts of parts meshed together with little concern if they fit or flow, good or bad, etc... dont waste your money"
2,It made me sick.,"I got this when I lived next door to a smoker. It did help clean the air but not immediately as the neighbor was smoking but it cleared the air much faster than it would have if I wasn't usint the unit.It was quiet and it had no filters I had to replace but if I left it on long enough this God awful metallic smell would come from it and it made the air feel heavy to me. Even after I'd shut it off, it still had an odor to it.I would not recommend this unit. For me, it seemed bad for my health, just by the way it made me feel after it had been on for awhile."
1,DON'T BU,"bought from local store. within 30 minutes the cleaning light came on. followed instructions, worked for 10 minutes, clean light again. tried several times to no avail to clean device. washed blades and dried them, still problems.. cleaned the ""ionizer wire"" with a cloth (as well as the apparently USELESS cleaning lever), same deal. This thing is junk, I wish I would have read the reviews on this wonderful piece of ... equipment before buying it. I'll stick with my noisy yet cleanable IFD air filter."
1,Rip Off,"Purchased 3 Ionic Pro Turbos. Within 2 months use 2 didn't work at all and one made horrible hissing noises. Cleaned them according to manufactures directions. Finally called customer service and was told for just under $80 a piece I could ship them back to them (at my expense) and they would in turn send me 3 reconditioned ones (again at my expense). When I asked to speak to a supervisor because I thought this was by no means a warranty, the rep, who spoke very broken English to put it kindly, told me it wouldn't do any good. That is Ionic Pros warranty. Have written letters, and tried to speak with a supervisor to no avail. Have already paid around $550 for the 3 machines and will certainly not be sending them another $240 to replace machines that should be covered under a real warranty. A rip off at best."
3,DISSADISFIED,"I USED IT ONE WEEK . THE ROOM I HAD IT IN WAS ONLY 12X14 AND I DID NOT GET A WIFF OF FRESH AIR. I GOT A VERYSTRONG ODOR . I GUESS IT WAS OZONE. THE ON SWITCH WAS ON LOW, BUT I HAD TO TURN IT OFF WHILE I SLEPT. I THEN RETURNED IT FOR A REFUND. IT COST ME $16 TO SHIP IT BACK, AND $15 FOR SHIPPING IT TO ME."
4,I works!,"Hi;Bought this item ""Ionic Breeze"". No problem with set up, just pull it out of the box.It really does make the air fresher. And, you can feel a cold breeze from the unit when it is on.Clean up is simple enough. Wipe the blades. Mine did start to rust with slightest bit of moister. So, clean it often.Good LuckL. Spencer"
1,I can't Believe No One Has Complained About The Smell!!!,"If you can stand the horrible smell that this machine creates, I'm sure it does a fine job cleaning the air. Had to take it back to Bed Bath and Beyond.I don't think it is this specific air purifier that is causing the smell. I think it the type (Ionizing) that is causing it."
1,Ionic Pro Turbo-- Wast of Money,This Type of Air Purifier is a Joke on Everybody Who Buys One.Save Your Money and Forget About it. The Wolfman
4,Less Ozone; Great blade access; A good buy,"Since the recent media coverage on the negative effects of ozone inhalation dangers, it looked like ion air purifiers were on the way out. This is one of the new generation (like the new Ionic Breeze) which vows to eliminate that danger. Of course, you can still smell a hint of ozone, but it isn't nearly as pronounced as the brand of another, ozone generating ionic that I've owned. Collection plate cleaning on this one is a breeze. And, as for the effects of eliminating allergens for my wife and I, it's A-1. She doesn't snore anymore. America sleeps better. Cheers."
1,It is a lemon,"I have 7 ionic air purifiers. Three are ionic pro where the collection blades are top loaded. They have been working daily like a gem for over a year. The frequency of cleaning depends on the amount of dust and allergens in the air. Our house is fairly clean - no smokers, etc. and I clean every 2-4 weeks. I also have two of the Ionic pro turbo which are front loading and they have been lemons since the beginning. They continuouly turn themselves off. If they have been sitting off for a few weeks, they will run about 24 hours when first turned on, then with each subsequent turn on, they run shorter and shorter periods of time..... down to just minutes at a time. They are Junk. My other two are top loading Ionic Breeze by Sharper Image and they are great also..... much like the top loading Ionic Pro."
2,Replacement blades not available,"I really like the Ionic Pro Turbo. It does well at keeping the air clean, with very little ozone smell. The weekly cleaning is easy, although waiting 24 hours to dry is a long time. I have looked all over to find a replacement blade set so I can swap them out while one is drying. I cannot find them anywhere. The ones made for the Ionic Pro (not turbo) do not fit in this air cleaner. So, great air cleaner, but replacement parts are not available."
1,Buyer Beware,"Ionic Pro Turbo - Buyer beware. Unit worked OK for about one month, and then cleaning frequency increased until we were doing a Deep Cleaning daily, as the unit would just sit and squeal. Contacted Customer Service, which is really an oxymoron, because there was no ""service"" involved. After days of sitting on hold, leaving messages trying to get a hold of a Customer Service Rep, as they never returned calls, they authorize the return of my defective unit for exchange. Now for the warranty, it does not cover the cost to return the unit to CA, which I could accept under protest, but then upon receipt of the defective unit you need to call them and provide them with a credit card to cover their $39.95 processing fee ...excuse me ... I have to pay additional costs for a defective unit? Unit is made in China; the product probably costs less than $39.95. I'm cutting my losses and dumping my unit in the trash, I'll find a real company and a unit that actually works as advertised."
1,Do yourself a favor and shop around,"The Ionic Pro Turbo worked great for about a week. I don't have pets or an excessively dusty house. I followed the directions to the letter, but it continued to make the buzzing sound even after being cleaned. Now it won't work at all. I've had it about 2 months. I've cleaned it several times (not that there is anything to clean) and now as soon as I turn it on it immediately tells me to clean it. It's not in a large room either. I am extremely disappointed in this item and would not recommend to anyone. I read in one review that they had luck with top loading purifiers, but I won't buy from this maker again."
1,Quality Issues - stay away,"The Ionic Pro Turbo requires very specific cleaning instructions that are a pain. Nonetheless, I followed the instructions to a T. The unit buzzes loudly if it is not cleaned. In my case, no matter how much I cleaned it the unit began to buzz nonstop after 6 months. The manufacturer told me tough luck. They would replace it for $60 and I had to pay shipping to send the old unit back and get the new one. So the total cost was going to be $80. I decided to pass and look for a higher quality better unit. Stay away from products from this company. They are unreliable."
1,Don't bother to buy this item ...,"I recently purchased a total of five of these Ionic Pro room air purifiers. Out of those five, I already have issues with three of them. One doesn't stay on. I have to keep turning it on. One makes a loud hum noise, so I have that one turned off and one stopped working all together. HORRIBLE ITEM AND EXPENSIVE. I would definitely not recommend or purchase again. I bought one from one seller and the other four from another seller. The sellers were both great ... it is the product that I would not endorse or recommend."
4,Works great!,"This product works great for me, I'm very allergic to many things and this helps me deal with that. I bought this product over a year ago and used it when I first started acting up... due to sneezing. It eventually went away and I haven't used it till now again. I just bought a dog and started getting itchy. After using this I finally got rid of the itchiness and am back to my normal life.This product can only be used in one primary room, it does cover a lot of space though. Easy to clean and not that hard to figure out.only problem is that it releases this weird smell sometimes like some sort of mist, but I guess you get used to it.HEPA filter thank you!"
2,Terrible product!,"Same as another reviewer, this only worked about 1 and 1/2 months for me...supposedly too late to return! Same issue with constant cleaning and then not turning on at all. What a waste of money."
2,"Worked ok, now slowly failing...","I don't normally post reviews, but wanted to validate and confirm some of the other reviews for this product.I did read the reviews prior to buying, but thought I'd give it a try anyway.It worked ok for about 5 months, then began to shut itself off after an hour or two. I also experienced the cleaning light coming on a day after being exhaustively cleaned-according to the directions.I've contacted customer service, and have yet to get a reply; given others' experiences with the customer service at the company, I'm fairly skeptical.I expected more from the amount paid for this piece. Don't bother with this item."
5,Works great at removing cigarette smoke,Works great at removing cigarette smoke. I bought it for use in a large one bedroom apartment. The tenant chain smokes and doesnt open windows. The smoke has stained everything. After painting I installed this machine and it completely removes any odor or trace of smoke from the air. I'm a non smoker and can smell even the smallest amount of smoke when present in the air. This machine does the job to remove it from the air. It does need to be cleaned about every 2 weeks. Not a problem because you just wipe the metal blades clean with soapy warm water to remove the gummy cigarette smoke. silent operation & costs pennies a day to operate.
2,I have both. Ionic Breeze is my choice.,"I thought I would save money buying this product. I also have an IONIC BREEZE that is 3 years older. The ionic breeze collects ""considerably"" more debris and has worked trouble free for over 3 years. Both produce a sound if they need cleaning. I clean them routinely, usually before any sound is produced. After three months the Ionic Pro Turbo started to produce the high whining sound it is supposed to when needing cleaning, but it will not go away.The IONIC BREEZE is a more robust and reliable product, and if the collector blades are any indication, the IONIC BREEZE removed ""considerably more"" particles from the air in the room.I wanted to save $150.00 and went with the Ionic Pro Turbo and it was a mistake."
2,Sadly Disappointed,I ordered 3 units. They arrived on time. But I had to return 2 of the units. The cleaning light came on and stayed on. The third unit seems to be working fine. Although I would have thought the light to notify me to clean the blades would have turned on by now it still hasn't. I'm just keeping a eye on the dust collection and cleaning the unit as needed. I can tell you this unit does do a great job of cleaning the air. I use it in my husbands office where not only he spends his day but our pet dragon lizard and large gerbil are housed. Since using you can enter that room and not know as soon as you walk in that some sort of pets live in there. Also extremely quiet to operate. One other bonus it does take out the pollen that has been in the air the last 4 weeks. You can actually feel the difference breathing in that room compared to breathing in the other rooms. B Russell
3,Maybe a solution for the common problems,"Mine worked fine for almost a year, then it started with the common complaints...bug zapper sounds, & the red clean me light. I cleaned it with a vacuum, & cleaned the collector plates so you could eat off them. Turned it back on, blue OK light for about 3 minutes, then red light. Tried several more times, same result. Last resort, blew out entire unit with my garage air compressor. Lasted about 5 days before red light came on. Bug zapper sound continues. This is from dust collecting on that wire running top to bottom, that the slide cleaner on top is supposed to clean. It works well for a while, but it is a plastic disc that runs around the wire & it starts to wear & is less effective. I now clean the collector plates once a week & I wipe the wire with a micro fibre cloth, & its been over a month, no red light, no zapper sounds at all!"
3,Best on the market - and cheap!,"First of all, the music's not very good. It ranges from soft country to overproduced schmaltz. On the other hand, this is Johnny Cash..... Anyway, recorded 1963-1980 for Columbia Records. Best songs: Christmas As I Knew It, The Christmas Spirit, Christmas With You (with June Carter Cash), I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day, and That Christmasy Feeling. This imported CD has 20 tracks, whereas most domestic collections have 12. Track listing:1. Blue Christmas2. The Little Drummer Boy3. The Christmas Spirit4. I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day5. Away In A Manger6. Joy To The World7. Silent Night8. Christmas As I Knew It9. Ringing The Bells For Jim10. Here Was A Man11. The Gifts They Gave12. It Came Upon A Midnight Clear13. O Come All Ye Faithful14. Little Grey Donkey15. The Christmas Guest16. Hark! The Herald Angels Sing17. The Ballad Of The Harp Weaver18. Who Kept The Sheep19. There'll Be Peace In The Valley For Me20. That Christmasy Feeling"
4,Education and Community,"Dr Dianne Gereluk has written one of the clearest and most scholarly books on the topic ofEducation and Community. Of the many books I reviewed, Dr Gereluk's work is oneof the few that probes deeply into the issues and philosophy at stake.I am using this book in a doctoral level class and I recommend her work."
4,Works Great!,Bought this to replace my Hunter fan switch that broke in less than a year. Problem was the slide tabs both broke off.Who designed this? It was obvious the tabs were not strong enough. I hope this Lutron fan and light controlwill last longer. The tabs appear to be made stronger but only time will tell.
2,Repetitive and defective!,"The video and audio quality are outstanding. The interviews a little kitschy. The problems are that if you bought the first series DVD, which was an overview of the whole series, you already have half of the tracks here. Also, might just be my copy but the video/audio don't sync for the Woods/Sanborn tracks."
3,Bulova watch,"The watch overall is beautiful. The shipping was fine. My issue is with the sizing of this band. Im not sure if it is a manufacturers defect, but this watch is EXTREMELY difficult to size. The band came very large and very stiff. The pins that hold the links together are near impossible to remove! My jeweler broke 3 tools trying to pop any of the pins out! I own a half a dozen watches and NEVER had any issues sizing like I do with this one. My jeweler was not able to size it more than one link as I needed a total of 5 removed. He actually has it in New York having another jeweler look at it.Again, overall, I love the appearance of the watch...but I would have sent it back if I knew it would be this much trouble to try and wear!!"
4,"excelent, Excellent, EXCELLENT!","I absolutely loved this book! It was completely different from the movie, but i find it better. It was a little slow but it still kept me turning the pages in antisipation. But the movie is a MUST SEE! It's a little gory but it keeps you on the edge of you seat and biting your nails the whole time!"
5,The best overall resource for the training professional.,"This is an encyclopedia in one volume for the training professional -- one you can't do without. In clear, concise language the Eitington provides the concepts and ideas to prepare the learning environment, involve the participants, deliver content, and evaluate the learning experience. You won't find another book like it anywhere!"
4,WOW!!,"First of all, I bought this outfit for me as much as for her. I it a nice quality very sexy outfit. Outfit maybe way to big a word for it. It's a little skimpy, but if the wearer doesn't mind a lot of skin( I know I didn't) very attractive. Things are covered so you must use some imagination, but that has to be part of the allure of any kind of clothing like this. Price is right and it will turn you on in all the right ways!"
3,Good idea - poor design,"This is a cool little gadget, but I found it difficult to use. All of the operational buttons are on the back of the unit and are in an awkward circular layout. You have to turn the unit over to find the correct button, then back again to see the display. Even if you memorize the layout of the buttons, they are flat, and have no tactile feedback. You find yourself hitting 2 buttons at once quite often. And if you're trying to set the timer in the dark, forget it. The backlit display is nice, but it only stays on for 3 seconds at a time. Not nearly long enough. I`m surprised that this is the second version of this unit, and is still so awkward to use. It's obvious that whoever designed this thing doesn't use one."
5,Definitely not for the closed-minded,"This book is, arguably, the funniest thing I have ever read in my life. Seeing these ""normal"" gay guys (and girls, too) has helped me face my own homosexuality. This book can (and should) be enjoyed by mature, open-minded readers of any and all persuasions."
4,really great indie pop,"This will probably go out of print sometime soon due to the lack of promotion behind it, but the Owl and the Pussycat put out one of the year's best records. Lois and one of the members of the Moore Brothers combine to make some really great indie-folk-pop with some really cool harmonies. I would recommend it to anyone that has heard either of the two artists that are part of this group. If possible, try and download Tigers before you buy the record to get an idea of how good the album actually is."
3,Just fine :),"The cover was a bit marked up, but it serves my purposes just fine. No problems with the actual disk, and that's what really counts."
1,Bad quality,This item is very bad quality! Stopped working within 3 days. The inset keeps coming out of the sides where it's supposed to be stuck in. Flimsy product and terribly overpriced at over $10 and shipping. Will not buy again. And it was only one wheel!!
2,Ok but needs improvement,Had some parts cut out but was still ok...the big disapppintment was the song. They changed it and its not right the original song ia Entre El Amor Y El Odio by Angel Lopez...great song!
5,Couldn't be better,"This telenovela passed in Brasil, and whe I saw it in Amazon, I knew it sholud be mine! I saw all the two discs in only one day, because I really loved it. All the scenes I loved were in the box, except one in the end, when Ana Cristina discover that she's pregnant... But, it couldn't be perfect!!!"
2,Didn't made sense,"story had noooooooo coordination editing didn't make sense, saw full version a lot of crucial parts were left out."
3,No Chemistry,Good concept but I was disappointed with the lack of chemistry with the leading characters.
2,dabdruff remover,"I ordered this at the request of my husband, as he remembered it from his youth. However, he didn't like it due to it having oil in the mix, so i reordered a bottle without the oli."
4,better live,"i heard these guys a few months ago at a live show, outside of prague, when they played after the former members of LCP. they were much better live - seemed to enjoy the audience groove and the feeling of just surrendering to the reverb. it probably didn't hurt that LCP had just put on a *rockin* show and that the audience was primed for a great next set. if you like the sounds of this album, but want that extra oooomph that you got the first time you listened to OK Computer, and thought wow - that's how my mind works - you should check out the new LCP (liberation du culture populaire) album, out april 25th in europe. i think matador has their US release rights. but this is a good start 'til you can get it!"
2,Interesting but not much more,"The lyrics present a collage of imagery that is intriguing at first, but every song is written in the same style, which gets annoying after a while. The same can be said for the melodies. These sound like assembly line songs all packaged in the same wrapper."
1,"Hartz Flexa foam dog ball Not as pictured/described, nor depicted","My dog is hooked on these balls and has had one since August 2008 (from a friend in MN) so I was looking for a replacement (was worried in case we lost it), found these on Amazon & was ecstatic. That was short lived-the color of the new found balls came in a red & green (hmmm) okay we can live with that, but within two weeks neither ball squeaks anymore and only one has any partial bounce at all, altho there are no tears ect. The ball that is over a year old has more bounce than the new ones and more squeak too....what a dud, don't waste your money like I did!"
5,Favorite toy,My dogs favorite ball. He even sleeps with it. I bought 6 so when they wear out I have a new one on hand.
3,"Ok ball, not great...",This ball squeaked for about 10 minutes before it was broken and no longer worked. When it did work you could hardly hear it. It does bounce around in different directions so my dog still likes to chase after. I would say this ball is ok but if you want a squeaky toy I would go with something else.
4,Favorite at our house,This is my dog's absolute favorite toy. She will play fetch forever with it if I let her. It has to be replaced regularly though because it loses its bounce. I buy them at Walmart for under $3. The squeaker part also tends to start poking out and it doesn't squeak well then (which is fine by me because I get tired of that noise but the dog loves the squeak). If your dog isn't a chewer you might not have that problem.
5,Dudley's favorite toy!,"My Westie, Dudley, is wild about this latex squeaker ball. Not too hard, not too soft, but just right for him. The squeaker doesn't last long (none do with Dudley), but this is the only ball he wants to catch & chase. Still have to replace the ball with a new one every few months- Just wish I could find them in local stores... I order them 4 at a time thru Amazon."
3,This was cute but not great,"The idea for this book is cute. In the story a family decides to visit the art museum (presumably for the first time) and the book follows their visit through the museum with complaints and good times. Even though there are complaints in the beginning, everyone is glad they visited the museum in the end. The book is very low on actual content. The writing is done through the bubbles of each person speaking. There is no real information about the art or a museum and how to visit one. Since I have worked for art museums most of my life, I would have like to see something with more helpful information or some educational content along with the fun conversation between the family members otherwise when you have read it once, there is no reason to ever pick it up again."
5,"I still remember it, years and years later","I grew up looking at the pictures in (and later reading) this book. I loved it so much, and I still think about it at age 20! Definitely got me very interested in art and I'm still an artist today!"
5,.....of St. Thomas's Leipzig (Bach predecessors/successors),"This disc features 12 cantors at St. Thomas from Seth Calvisius ""Unser Leben wa:hret siebzig Jahr"" to Erhard Mauersberger ""Die Heiling des Blinden von Jericho"". Very interesting pieces here performed 1989 by the then cantor Hans-Joachim Rotsch. Timing 55'36. German texts only.Incidentally if you want to find more Capriccio releases on Amazon, search Classical by record label and you will find titles of c.540 releases that do not show on artist searches - including a lot of German choral rarities. (You'll have to guess at the artists and exact contents)."
4,Essential for John Lee Hooker fans.,"I loved this C.D. On no other C.D. will you find 40 John Lee Hooker songs (including; Boom Boom, Dimples, and Boogie Chillun) for only 15 bucks. This is also a good C.D. if you wanna' try out John Lee Hooker. You might say, ""I wanna' John Lee Hooker C.D., but I don't wanna' pay an arm and a leg for it. Also, I wanna' C.D. that has a lot of songs on it, that way if I do like it, I'll have a bunch of songs!"" Summed up, you gotta' buy this C.D.!"
1,Candles-,"They look nice but they are very,very easy to break seal where they screw to turn on - so then can 't use them w/the batteries. Was disappointed w/them and glad only got 1 set."
1,Orange!,"The flame color of these candles is very orange. Will not look good if you are using white lights elsewhere. I could tolerate yellow or golden flame, but these were too orange. Base very cheap and lightweight."
2,Doesn't come with gloves!,"this costume did not include the gloves, which is why i bought it. very dissapointing!"
1,Can't Stand the Scent,"The Nivea face wash, face scrub, and protective face lotion all have a mild scent. This mild version of the balm has a strong, overpowering scent that reminded me of Old Spice or Speed Stick deodorant. I now have a bottle that has been used once, and won't be touched again.The subdued scent of the other Nivea for Men products is not a problem. I'm tempted to try the sensitive skin unscented version of the balm."
3,Not live up to Intel's name,"We have been using AMI(LSI)'s Raid card for quite a while. This time I want to try something else, so Intel was on top of the list, and I was lucky to find it @Amazon.com. The card is relatively big, but one of the problems is that unlike AMI/LSI's solution, it won't share IRQ with some card, so I have to move around the card in order to let it work. Another disappointment is the performance is about 15% less than the AMi/LSi's solution, and that is you set the strip size to max(128k), other than this size the performance will degrade dramatically."
2,Close but no cigar,"I'm all for Spanish foreign films and I was really looking forward to seeing this one since I love to be at the edge of my seat covered in suspense. This movie however, when it was near to becoming a real riveting thriller just took all the wrong moves. The characters can be likable but they're not giving a lot of development that its very easy to stop caring for them. Worst of all, the film takes a turn for the melodrama that doesn't fit in and isn't at all very successful.The cast is fine and the premise is more than interesting, but when it comes to the parts that are suppose to be shocking, scary, and disturbing it just comes off weak and, dare I say it, almost boring."
3,"Quite Good, But a Little Dragged Out","At the end of volume 6, we find that Boy #2, Keita Iijima, has finally found boy #19, Shinji Mimura, and Boy #12, Yutaka Sato.We then flash back to one of Shinji's previous experiences with Keita. After he lost at an arcade game, he went to buy them drinks as part of a deal. Shortly after, Shinji gets into a fight. Keita comes back and witnesses the fight, but hides. Unfortunately, Shinji saw him. Ever since then, Shini could never trust Keita.Yutaka wants Keita to join them, but Shinji doesn't trust him. This little quarrel may actually turn deadly and threaten Shinji's plan to blow up the school.in conclusion, this was a pretty satisflying volume. Some moments may be dragged out, but it only adds to the suspense. Not my favorite volume, but an exciting action-packed installment nonetheless."
3,Edited Versions?!,"This is not a review, but rather an appalled question. I see several reviews talking about these being edited versions... first of all WHY?? It says ""complete__Season"" if they are edited, then it isn't complete!! How do you know they are edited? And are the first four seasons, (which I already own) also edited episodes?"
2,dum da dum dum dum....,This is a really dum season the rest of the seasons are funny but this one is a complete waste of money
5,Last season including Barney,"Everyone in our family is a fan of the Andy Griffith show, and this is a great season with many classic episodes. It's also the last season to feature Barney Fife and to be in black and white. There are lots of laughs with the return of Ernest T. Bass and the Fun Girls, a lot of good episodes with Goober, and Barney is at his best as always. I don't think you will be disappointed with it."
5,Andy Griffith For All Seasons (1-8) *249 episodes,"I would also like to thank Paramount for finally bringing the Andy Griffith Show (seasons) to us on DVD. I have read many reviews and agree with most of them. Once Barney left the show there was a void that could never be filled by Warren (Barney's replacement), However seasons 6-8 I mostly can not wait for. There are so many great episodes in these seasons. I spent three years of my life recording these shows on late night TBS and other stations. I finally got all 249 episodes in that time and have waited YEARS for these DVD's. One of my all time favorites is ""Dinner at Eight"" where Goober messes up phone directions and causes Andy to have to eat 3 spaghetti dinners.(Goobers, Howards and Helens). Everytime I see it. I just have to have spaghetti. I can go on and on naming great episode after episode, but I will spare you all. So I say if you aren't a fan of the ""Color"" years...just give them a chance. You will be!"
5,GREAT SHOW,"VERY fun, family friendly and think it should return to TV so kids can watch it after school instead of some of the shows that are on now... I know it's on in the mornings, but kids are in school when it's on TV"
3,"To Buy, Or Not To Buy?","I have not made up my mind about buying this set. I was so excited a while back when TAGS finally made it to DVD season by season. But like many other major fans of the show, I have been so disappointed with Paramount's offerings. One the one hand, I am grateful to have my favorite TV show on DVD season by season. On the other, I do not want to through my money away on these less than complete versions, only to get hit with the price of buying the ""remastered uncut versions"" somewhere down the road. Why can't they just get it right the first time?I will probably go on and buy this 5th season (one of TAGS finest). I will be the shmuck, because I love the show."
2,Andy Griffith series,These shows are great. A reflection of a better time in our country when we could watch TV without a lot of bathroom/bedroom conversation passed off as humor but really reflecting writers so void of creativity they have to resort to the usual trash.
5,A delightful read,"There are lots of technical boating books out there and they are easy to find. This book chronicles one couple's own adventure on the ""Great Loop"" in their first cruiser, a 40' (wow) trawler. I loved the writing style--great humor and sometimes romantic descriptions of the goings on (Mr.'s descriptions of Mrs., their married kids' near ""marital conflagration"" on deck, the story of the chocolates, cruising with the senior ladies. The descriptions of the travel are very well written. The experiences aboard will be appreciated by addicted boaters and non-boaters alike. This is an adventure story. When I finally retire and head for the Great Loop in my cruiser, I will think often and fondly of the Stob's and this delightful book."
5,"Great Book, Fun & Informative!","Honey, Let's Get a Boat is a must read for any boater or ""Armchair Sailor"" who longs for that ""Great Adventure"". Ron and Eva have beautifully captured all the fun, laughter, trials & tribulations of leaving home and hearth for a year and following a dream. This book combines the best of cruise guide and travelogue with a little comic relief thrown in for good measure."
5,Delightful and Informative Reading,Live the great cruising adventure vicariously through Ron and Eva. This book is fun and funny! I lived each moment with Ron and Eva as they picked up their new treasure and attempted one of the great American dreams--going crusing. Ron is a delightful and descriptive writer. A good read for anyone but particularly for anyone thinking about a change of lifestyle. Cruising is not for everyone and as Ron points out different ages need different comforts. Read this book if you are THINKING about cruising and give it to anyone who might possibly be entertaining the thought. The spouses will thank you!!
4,"Honey, Let's Get a Boat","Very intertaining, as well as being very helpful if one decides to do The Loop. A must read (for any type of boating) for boaters."
2,Good if you're rich. Not a book for commoners.,"I really hope to do the loop someday and the Stob's book is a great guide on how to do it if you have tons of money and own a big yacht. I plan to do it in a working man's boat (23 ft sail/trawler) with limited funds and will write a book on how the average person can do it affordably. Like I say this is a good ""How to"" book for the rich... not much for the common man."
2,BUYER BEWARE - Incorrect Track Listing,"The tracks listed on Amazon.com currently (Jan. 2007) are not correct -7 tracks listed here do not actually appear on the CD set. They are:Ray's Rockhouse, Body And Soul, Helpless, Love For Sale,Down South Camp Meetin, Sing Moten's Swing, and Stompin at Mahogany Hall.In their place are 4 newer songs from 1997-2006, along with Popcicle Toes,So You Say (Esquinas), and Why Not (Manhattan Carnival).For me, the loss of Body & Soul and Ray's Rockhouse (both among their 15 ""Greatest Hits"") made this set a throwaway. Hold on to your old 2-CD box ""Down In Birdland"" from Rhino."
4,review of The Bridge Builders,This is a very good book written by Rudyard Kipling and gives you the way life was in the olden days. The way of life in India is shown through the writing of this book.
1,Love Glove Grooming Mitt,"I purchased this to groom my cat based on reviews. Looks ok, but every time try to use it, he runs away, not as gentle as I would have liked. He is not use to being groomed. I do better with a comb. Can't recommend."
4,Easier than a brush,My husky/g.shepherd doesn't like being brushed but she tolerates the mitt very well. No dropping it or getting it tangled in fur. Great for dry brushing or scrubbing a dirty puppy during bathing. Two paws up!
2,keep looking...,This mitt could be better if there were more center rubber material and less fabric. There's too much fabric and the material is like a perforated fabric that gets the fur stuck in it. I spent more time trying to remove cat fur from the glove than brushing my cats! Keep looking cause I know there are better ones out there as I used to have one.
2,Doesn't work very well,"Use your money and buy a comb. It doesn't work any where NEAR as good, and it's very hard to get the hair out of the mitt."
4,Great for cats. Mediocre for hands.,"I bought this to replace the harsh, metal brush I was using that snagged my cat's fur and made yer yelp and bite. Not only is this product gentler never irritates her, but to my surprise, it picks up much more hair as well. The rubber prongs seem to attract the hair like a magnet. No complaints in that dept.My only problem is with the design.It doesn't fit my hand very well and tends to shift around. The thumb pad is totally extraneous, and its hot, and tends to make my hand sweat. I would definitely buy a product that had the same brushing surface but on a stick instead. In fact, I may take this one apart and make on myself."
5,"Stupid Name, Awesome Product","I was doubtful when I first opened the package, but everyone of my cats starts purring instantly when I pet them with the glove on. And it works better for getting rid of excess hair than any brush I've tried. I'm so happy with it that I'm about to order a second one so that I can always have one handy if the other is in the wash. I highly recommend it."
2,Didn't work for me and my mastiff,"I was very disappointed in this product. My mastiff has short hair, and I had read that this style of grooming product worked well. I ended up purchasing a Pet Zoom which works well. I found that this glove doesn't pick up as much hair as my brush, fits too loosely on my hand to be comfortable, and is difficult to clean. Sure, clumps of hair will shake off easily, but most of her hairs (along with whatever dirt or skin particles there are) remain on the glove. Unfortunately for my dog, this was a waste of money."
4,Love the Love Glove,"A kinder, gentler, more effective dog groomer. Mine loves it and hops at the chance to get combed."
2,Works great. Norman doesn't like it tho.,"Owner review: 5 stars. Easy to use. Doesn't look like it would work, but it does! Especially good in conjunction with a brush (to get deeper).Norman The Cat review: 1 star. This thing scares me. When I see The Giant put this on, I jump out of his lap!Bottom line: If Norman doesn't like it, I can't use it. I brush him at least once a day and this is a ""brushing session cessation device"". I don't think it hurts him...I even ran it through my hair to see if it pulled (it doesn't)...I just think he doesn't like the Purple Hand of Love or something. Just one more thing not to understand about a cat."
4,My bunnies love it but I wish the nubs were slightly longer,It's easy to trick my bunnies into being groomed with this glove (they usually hate brushes) but I wish the nubs were just a little longer since it doesn't really get into their undercoats. This glove is good to use with a real brush but definitely not instead of a real brush.
3,Wish it came in a smaller size,"The surfaces (nubbly size for brushing your pet, and velvet-y side for wiping furniture) of this glove work well, I just wish it came in a smaller size. Even though it has an adjustable velcro wrist strap, I often find my hand cramping up trying to keep the mitt steady while brushing my dog. Otherwise, it works well. If you take a piece of masking tape and pat it on the glove afterwards, it removes the hair to clean the glove easily after use."
5,works as good as advertised,I have a persian cat and this thing took quite a bit of dead hair off. I still use a comb and brush most of the time. this is good every once in a while for getting rid of extra hair. the cat likes it but persians seem to like any kind of attention.
4,The best,"Pet while you groom. One of the best inventions ever for cat lovers. This glove is better than the others. One has teeth that aren't firm enough, the other has ineffective bumps instead of teeth. This glove's spacing and the firm, rounded teeth are perfect. They pick up the loose hair, bring out the oil in the coat and, according to my cat, they feel great. I deduct a star only because I wish they made a left-handed glove."
4,Good addition to grooming routine,"With two himalayans and a Maine Coon I have found this glove to be a great addition for my grooming routine.I can use the glove on my longhaired cats every other day and still maintain a smooth, unknotted coat. They are not fussy at all (on the days I use the glove) but on the off days I use the matting comb they quickly want to be done. My 4 pawed children enjoy the massage effect from the ""nubbies"" on the glove.The hair is also very easily removed after use. This is a great addition for any pet lover. Makes life easier for the pets AND the human."
3,"Great for pets, not as useful on furniture","The glove is great for grooming my cats. Gets the fur off and doesn't send it flying. However cleaning the fur off the glove isn't as easy as I'd hoped. Also, it takes a lot more work to clean off the furniture and sheets than the other glove I had."
3,My cat loves... to attack it,"It's become an entertaining chewing toy, so there's use for it, but really, as a grooming product, the little fella doesn't like it at all, can't stand it for more than a few seconds and either runs away or bites it. I was surprised, considering how much she loves petting."
3,Meh,I thought it was going to hold more loose hairs than what it actually does. Not the greatest grooming product I've bought. Make sure to use it outdoors because all hairs fall to the floor.
4,Great reference,"A good solid reference for anyone wanting to look up the gods of ancient Egypt. Very thorough, including minor as well as major gods, with summeries of the myths about them. Could use some more citations to help the reader find more in-depth information. A bit too much for the average person to own but well worth it for those interested in Egypt or basic comparative mythology."
4,Wiltse is Top Shelf,"Very puzzling to me that David Wiltse is not much better known in the Mystery/Crime Fiction genre. Everything I've read by him thus far has been very impressive, and this novel was no exception. I really think he belongs on the top shelf of crime fiction authors. John Becker, the FBI agent who features in this tale (and others in the series), is a fascinating, memorable character, and Wiltse weaves a mesmerizing, addictive plot into the mix. This one has plenty of political intrique, an international angle, and some horribly grisly crimes. Skillful plotting ensures that you will read this novel very quickly, caught up in both the crime angle and the endearing elements of Becker's character."
5,"Awesome Tool, Easy Integration","I had been looking to add Luther's Works to My Logos Libronix Digital Library System for some time. Truth be told, it was the reason I went with Logos Bible Software in the first place. The cost seemed prohibative at $250 until I found it on Amazon.com for $169 with free shipping! I read one review that said it was difficult to integrate with Libronix. I was nervous for that reason. However, it was NOT difficult at all. In fact, it was so simple, I wasn't sure I had done it right! This is an awesome tool, to have Luther's Works at your fingertips, to go from the index directly to the volume and page you need in a split second. Awesome! Thanks."
3,Assessing Luther's Works,"Downloading program from CD to my PC hard-disk went smoothly. But when I tried to copy part of text to the clipboard, it went smoothly for the first time but if I did it second time with other selected text the program gave no response - I had to exit and then reran and repeated the process again. Also when I searched for particular word or phrase it displayed the results without showing correct page number and it bypassed footnotes. In short the search engine is not too user friendly."
1,That's Tough,"""That's tough"" was once an expression commonly heard when you were expected to put up with something disagreeable. ""That's tough"" is the answer that I have received thus far from Logos software and Augsburg with regard to this product. I purchased an HP computer, a few years ago already. I had already been using this product on my old computer. When I tried to install it on my new computer, it would only install a tiny portion of the program. I have communicated with both Logos and Augsburg, but they've been no help. That was many months ago. I haven't heard from them since. They haven't even bothered to find out if the problem has been resolved. I won't be buying a product like this again. You may be able to install it on your computer, but will you be able to install it on your next computer?"
4,A Great Linguistic Reference,This book is chock full of linguistic information about the many diverse Amerindian languages and has an excellent bibliography. My only regret is that it includes almost nothing on Amerindian sociolinguistics. It would probably be difficult and dry reading for people not already interested in linguistics; most of the book is fairly technical.
5,The Languages of Native North America,This comprehensive introductory text is strengthened by a bibliography that will point the reader to detailed studies of American Indian linguistics.
3,good enough,fine dusts clogs it quickly. Ended up installing it with a separate drywall bag for concrete grinding. All said it works amazingly.
5,Beyond the Textbook,We have just finished our unit on the Civil War. The projects in this book are fantastic. My eighth graders used many of them to create a Civil War museum. They then presented their museum to fourth graders using their artifact to teach a key aspect of the Civil War. Even my most reluctant learners did an exceptional job. I highly recommend this book to any teacher of American History and/or any student

3,Not enough fizz,"Somehow, this novel seemed a bit flat to me. It needed an injection of fizz. This was the second novel of Trollope's that I read, and I thought that the characters in ""The Spanish Lover"" were not as fleshed-out nor as believable as those in ""Marrying the Mistress.""Or perhaps I just should not have read two of Trollope's books in a row. Maybe I expected too much of this book.The author uses the device of grownup twin sisters to compare and contrast their lives. The two women, Frances and Lizzie, are very different. When Frances takes a married Spanish lover, the book becomes not just the story of her romance, but the story of how Lizzie deals with it, and what happens to her life as a result of her twin's affair.The ending was a bit too pat and predictable, but all in all, the novel was fairly enjoyable and quickly read."
3,Entertaining light reading,"The plot device of writing about two very different twin sisters was Trollope's way of contrasting differing ideas of femininity. Frances and Lizzie are quite distinct. Their lives carry you along, but the plot at times borders on the unbelievable. Some of the events were a bit contrived (the near dissolution of the 'perfect' marriage) and the end of the plot was predictable. It was the kind of entertaining reading for a weekend away, or when you don't want to tax yourself too much."
5,great product for women,"I am in my forties. I've been suffering from dealing with aging process such as irregular menstration, low energy level, weight gains, etc. I've been taking this for 4 months now. I noticed immediate improvement in overall health condition. Try and see it for yourself."
4,Space Marine COmmander,"Excellent addition to any space marine army, lots of extra parts to customize other sergants and honor gaurd ect. Good product for its value."
4,Tons of bits! Only one model,"This box is packed with unique or rare bits for Space Marines. The downside is you only have one model to play with. For the price it would be nice to at least have two options for torso, legs and backpack. However, there are lots of extra bits that you can use to customize your Sergeants or veterans. And once again, being able to utilize magnets will help get your moneys worth out of this set. The are some nice weapon choices and you may not want to have your Captain stuck with just a bolt pistol and chainblade forever."
1,samples withdrawn; buying not,"The insanity of the music industry is revealed here. Once there were samples, now there is now way of telling whether to (like) buy this or not. Am NOT."
4,"Great Series, poor realeasing method","Love the series. Outstanding TV for the whole family. The problem is the way it is released. I like to buy a whole series, at once in one collection. The split series means more postage and other costs unless you wait long enough to get it at one time. That is a big disappointment."
2,Least favorite,of this series so far. The story lines just aren't as deep as could be. Personal views keep me from agreeing with the shows attitude so I couldn't like it these dvds. Touched by an Angel was one of the best shows out there even if it was a bit cheesy sometimes.
1,Cancelled my order today!,"A big thank you to all the Amazon reviewers! I pre-ordered SEASON 3 back in October 2005...wanted to be the first to get a copy because some of my favorite episodes were in SEASON 3... and after reading your comments/reviews, I find thatParamount Home Video is releasing the show into two volumes. No thanks! You are taking advantage of the fans and I am cancelling my order today. I advise everyone to do the same to get the message to the suites that made this decision. What a way to ruin an image of the best show on TV. People should be outraged!"
4,I care,"Yes, I have the right to voice my opinion on this season coming out in more than one volume. As a consumer, this is frustrating because I don't want to have to wait months at a time for a new volume to come out.This does not mean I do not like this series.It was my FAVORITE and I WILL buy it regardless of it having volumes."
1,DON'T BUY SPLIT SETS----RIP OFF!!,The only way to stop the companies that produce split sets is to NOT BUY THEM. This is a nice series and should be selling in the $ 35.00 range for the WHOLE SEASON.
5,natural alternative to Albuterol,"Doctors are prescribing albuterol inhalers for bronchial congestion and tightness. I opted for this natural Ivy Leaf extract - which is safe for kids, too. Found it helpful for a cough that was lasing for months."
5,history repeats itself,Are we going to win in Afghanistan? NO. Why? Read about the real reason. History repeats it self all the way back to the 17th Century.
2,A taste of Strawbs,"This album did not meet my expectations. I have a double vinyl album called The Best of Strawbs that is actually kick butt. I hoped this 5 cd compilation would match that, but it does not. Many of the songs are acoustic or other recordings of their songs, and for the price, way overpriced. Wouldn't buy it."
1,Bad product,If you plug the ringer futher than 10 foot it won't work. When it does work you can't hear it more than 10 foot away !!!!!!!!!
1,Piece of junk,"I wish I had gone to Amazon first - I bought this in a store, and it fails if you have aluminum siding - just does not connect. The instructions say to mount on a half inch piece of wood!! The sound level is also much too low."
2,dissapointed,barry did more talking than singing. seems like the dvd was more about promoting the girl group because they had more performance time than him. i don't recommend this particular dvd if you want a descent barry white performance.
2,Easy Read ... for a Reason,"When I picked up this book, I quickly discovered that I'd overlooked something: It is designed for adults who are learning to read. With that caveat in mind, Jesse James and the Civil War in Missouri is an interesting glance at the influence of the Civil War and Quantrill's Raiders on the infamous Frank and Jesse James.Given its goal of being a easy-to-read book, Dyer decent a good job of describing the divisions between Unionists and Confederate sympathizers in Missouri and the rather limited role the James Brothers played in the Civil War. All in all, the book mostly whets one's appetite for more information, but there are some good photos and basic information that might recommend the book, particularly to younger readers who are interested in the Wild West or the Civil War."
5,ahead of its time,Anyone who doesn't like this album is slow or lacks a sense of originality.This was a very original cd with a little bit of everything on it.My favorites include funk gets stronger 1 and 2and the title track.The influence of this album is heard (especially the horns and drumline of funk gets stronger)in a lot of rap music.If you have any taste or sense of originalitybuy this album.
2,Quick and Dirty,"This little book originally sold at a cover price of $1.50 - I'd say that's about what it's worth today (2013). The text is brief and most of the reproductions are in black and white. I see no reason to buy this book when much better coverage of Davis, one of my favorite artists, is available for free on the Web. I made a mistake buying it - probably not paying enough attention to details about the book."
2,Magical Adventure CD,We own a majority of The Wiggle's collection and this is the first time we were truely disappointed. The CD is just over 36 minutes long and a good part of it is insturmental. So much for sing-a-longs in the car. My two year old son enjoys singing with them not with instuments. He'll even tell you to go to the next song until you get to them singing. Eariler works have proven to be much more enjoyable for our family. I really felt like this CD was not up to the quailty of The Wiggles past work.
2,Not like the others,"I hate to say this because we are such big wiggles fans here but please do not buy this cd, it is not like any of the others. We bought this cd thinking it was just like their others but it isn't in fact it is a soundtrack to the movie. It repeats many of their other songs and ALOT of the music is instrumental. My son will not listen to this cd, it was a total waste of out money. The wiggles are great but if you are looking for a good cd from them try Wake Up Jeff, Yummy Yummy, or Let's wiggle not this one."
2,Stick with the other wiggles CD's,"Alot of this cd is instrumental or music on other CD's. We love the wiggles and unlike their other cd's this one just doesnt cut it as a kids music cd. My son would rather listen to the others so this one just collects dust. The wiggles are awesome and so are their cd's just stick with some of the other ones instead. My son's (18 mos) favorites are Yummy Yummy, Wake up Jeff, and Let's wiggle. Buy one of those 3 instead and your little one will be pleased."
5,Tommy James & The Shondells Definitive,"This is actually all their greatest hits. The only one miss is Gone, Gone,Gone, which I believe was one of their earlier songs, and may not have been a top 40. But this is without a doubt all their greatest hits, on 1 cd instead of 2. I really love it,and I hope you will too.Most of the songs are really great and, and for me bring back great memories. Previously, I had to purchase 2 CD's to get the songs I wanted, which are now all on this CD. It's a keeper, for sure."
1,Touching but funny,"I think it's hilarious that, in defending her father against Mr. Whitt's crticism of his poor grammar and spelling, Ms. Ross-Ryan uses words and grammar that are unrecognizable as English and do, indeed, make her father look like a literary genius. The apple really does not fall far from the tree."
4,"Well drawn, kinky, explicit graphic novel.","Both my fiance and I enjoyed this well drawn, erotically charged graphic novel. Containing several separate stories, this book has something to arouse both males and females. Realistic watercolor and graphite b&w images depict a variety of sexual scenarios definately on the kinky side. As an artist myself, I can appreciate the skill and time that must have gone into this book. As a sexual being, I responded to the eroticism. (v.2 has been published as well)"
5,TRACK LISTINGS,"BOULDER BLUFFIT HAPPENED IN SUN VALLEYWHEN JOHNNY COMES MARCHING HOMEIDA!

LOUIS BLUES MARCHAT LAST"
2,Very disapointing,"I am very disapointed by this book, I sent it back to Amazon for refund 10 minutes after having opened the book. The content is poor, it mainly deals with techniques like hammer-on, slide, shuffle,I-IV-V etc. All this information can be freely accessed from the Net. There is nothing about what the blues really is and how it works (the first chapter dealing with the blues scale is...the appendix, can you believe that?). All examples are with open string chords, you want go farther than the 5th fret, which is IMHO a very bad approach. All in all the book may be worth the money only if you never ever played guitar and want to start with the blues."
2,More fun for the adults,"I bought Butterscotch for Christmas for my 5 year old daughter. Although I was incredibly impressed by the quality and features of the toy, after the initial excitement wore off (about 1 week), my daughter hasn't touched the horse. I think the fact that it doesn't walk or move (other than the head), is a disappointment for a child who wants a ""real"" horse. Butterscotch is well made and interactive (and easy to assemble), but I think it's more entertaining for the adults who've never had this type of toy growing up. I REALLY wish I didn't lay out all of the money I did for Butterscotch."
5,Butterscotch was a huge hit,Santa brought this to our niece for Christmas and it was the hit of the holidays. The pony's reaction to voices and touch is really amazing. It is worth getting the separate accessories set as our niece really enjoyed getting Butterscotch set with saddle and bridle.
2,FurReal Pony,"We purchased this pony for Christmas. When it arrived, it would not turn on. Amazon was great about getting another one to us but it was difficult to get it back to them since the head would not come back off. The other problem is that the second pony that we received does not work right. When the pony starts to animate, it makes a noise like a motor running but does not cannot catch. Sometimes it will do it what it supposed to do and other times it just makes the funny mentioned above. My four year has noticed it several times. The pony definately too expensive to have these kinds of problems."
3,Very noisy movements,"This toy was bought for a Christmas gift for my five year old daughter. She just loves horses. She was very disappointed in the jerky movements, and the noise that the horses head makes from moving from side to side. I as well was disappointed since the noise that the toy makes is hard to drown out, and the simple fact that after spending alot of money on this toy, my daughter does not want to play with it. Great concept, and great toy if you can get over the gear noise. I hope that in time the company will be able to improve on the product."
5,Pony for the Princess,"Butterscotch is super cute and extremely interactive. My daughter was wishing on stars for years for a real pony, which we just could not accomodate. :-) Well, this is certainly the next best thing. Santa brought this to her this year - she was thrilled beyond words. She ""rides"" him, feeds him, grooms him, and truly acts like he's a real pony - she's five. So, we've been happy. It's a bit pricey, but still cheaper than a barn and horse feed."
3,buterscotch has a weak neck,"We have had this pony since Christmas. My daughter is horse crazy but so far this little pony has charmed her for not so very much time. It isn't played with very much for the 270$ we paid for it. Now I found the neck floppy and moving around. I have three kids and maybe my son did something to it, I'm not sure. Now I have to contact hasbro or where we bought it to see if someone can help me repair it or take it back. I expect problems in doing so. I am very disappointed his neck was so fragile.Sad from Chicago..."
3,Extremely disappointed.,"This pony was way too much money for what it does. Whenever we asked our three year old son what we wanted for Christmas, he'd tell us ""Butterscotch the Pony."" Now that he has him, he's played with him for probably 30 minutes tops. He doesn't do much. Honestly, for as much money as he costs, he should walk or at least do more. We could've bought a real pony for the price."
4,Butterscotch Pony,"It is exactly as I expected. I saw one before I ordered them for my great-grandchildren. The moment I saw ""Butterscotch"" I knew they were a perfect gift for my great-grandchildren one boy and one girl. Don't know why the box only mentions that it is a gift for girls. Boys love it too!!"
5,FurReal Friends Butterscotch Pony,"Wow! This pony is amazing! It is very realistic and the kids have really enjoyed figuring out what it can do without looking at the instructions (eats a carrot, turns it's head, whineys, makes galloping sounds, etc...). It is the next best thing to a real pony, but it can be kept inside! We love it!"
3,Butterscotch review,"This is the second Butterscotch that we have owned and my daughter just loves it. I would recommend this friend, just have to be careful with the head. My daughter turned the head of both of hers while it was not turned on and now neither one of them will turn on there own anymore."
2,Cute but not what I expected,"This horse is cute and my 4 year old was very excited upon seeing her standing under the Christmas Tree this past Christmas but it did not live up to my expectations. Assembly was easy. Be warned, the horse arrives without its head being put on. And the quality of the product is very good.My daughter played non stop with ""Princess"" for about a week. Now she hardly touches her. I think part of the problem is that she can't get on her by herself. But I also think she wanted a horse that would move and this horse doesn't move except for its head and tail.Had I to do it over again, I would have bought an old fashioned rocking horse."
1,There are better rideable stuffed ponies out there!,"WHY on earth would a child need all the electronics in this thing? My girls' grandmother has a sturdy, large stuffed pony that probably cost at least half what this does. That pony does everything this pony does AND MORE - WITHOUT batteries! It's called IMAGINATION, people!!! The very first time anything goes wrong or breaks with this pony, it's ruined. Grandma's pony has far fewer things that could go wrong with it, and probably could be repaired by anyone with an upholsterer's needle and a thimble. Do your child a favor - buy one like Grandma's, and spend the rest of the money on REAL trail rides, pony carousels, and hay rides. You and your child will have a lot more fun."
3,Cute but overhyped,"My daughter has wanted Butterscotch for too long. Now that Christmas has come and gone, so has her interest. Butterscotch is durable and fun, but the horse movements are only entertaining for so long.[...]. I wish it actually moved forward or something!!Oh well, live and learn!2012 UPDATE: Three years later and we still have Butterscotch. He has moved around the house and is used more as an odd chair once in awhile than a plaything. I cant seem to part with this because of the top $$$ I paid, but Butterscotch goes down in our family history as, ""remember that horse you wanted soooo bad but never used?"""
4,Cute!,"I bought this for my daughter at the last minute because it was marked down to [...]. It's pretty life like but it's pretty hard to get it to fake gallop. It's only done it a couple of times. It also has trouble recognizing the direction it's being called. Overall it's very cute. I'll admit that it hasn't gotten much play time, though. It's just one of those things that's purchased for the shock value on Christmas and played with a few times after and that's about it."
3,A toy for horse lovers,"My 2 year old plays with this every so often for a couple minutes. The rest of the time we have a 3 foot tall stuffed horse sitting in the living room.We dressed it up for Halloween and it was a big hit for the treak-or-treaters.You have to weigh the ""how much is this really going to be used"" vs. ""how much storage space do I have"". Not like you can just stick this thing in a closet or toybox to take out to play."
3,Not a reliable toy!,"We got this for the Granddaughter last Christmas and it's never worked correctly. I had to keep it at the dance studio because my daughter in law was so afraid it would get broken the first day. The kids there have had a ball with it...WHEN it works, which isn't very often. Now something is VERY wrong with it, because instead of the loud noises it made before, it makes a HORRIBLE sound like a death rattle! This upset the children so much that we had to remove the batteries and tell eveyone that Butterscotch is SLEEPING. There is NO customer support from the manufactuer, so forget that! When it does work, it's great company, but when it doesn't, it's very sad! It's better for kiddos who UNDERSTAND it isn't real, the six to eight year old group!"
3,IF ORDERING FOR CHRISTMAS BEWARE,Caution: IF ordering for Christmas be aware that Amazon ships this in it's ORIGINAL box with HUGE PHOTO. ARE YOU KIDDING ME! It was left at our front glass door in full view....as a result the largest surprise for Christmas was officially ruined! The product itself is great. Amazon's shipping in original box with huge photo not good at all! Horrible experience.
1,Hasbro didn't give me my money back for defective toy,"When we went to put this pony together on christmas eve, the neck made a horrible noise and lilted to the left. It was horrible. We had to give it to our kids like that because there was no time to fix it and I thought we would be able to replace it. Hasbro said that they were discontinued so they couldn't replace it and they didn't send me the price I had paid for the pony, but the price it was on clearance after christmas. It was a horrible experience, and though a hasbro rep said she would refund the other 100 dollars, she never did, and they made us send them the head of the pony and dispose of the body ourselves. My kids were sad and it was a really bad experience."
5,Love this CD,"This Cd is great. It has all the La Bouche hits plus some other ones.Melanie Thornton had a wonderful voice and I was fortunate to hear her perform in person just months before her death.She actually sounded as good if not better in person.I do not know what the previous guy was thinking,but LA Bouche was definetly one of the better dance groups to come along."
5,Been enjoying them for years!,"This is by far, hands down, my favorite candy of all time. I've been eating them for over 40 years and never grow tired of them. They're a little hard to find here in Ohio, land of forgotten opportunity in general, so whenever I can find a website or feel like traveling 60 miles, I get them. The centers are smooth and creamy, and the caramel exteriors are just awesome. You have to be careful regarding the freshness, however, because this is definitely one candy that HAS to be fresh. You'll wind up needed jaw surgery if they're stale! LOVE these guys, highly, highly recommend!"
3,A Family Favorite!,"I haven't had these in awhile, but I grew up on them!Since the weather had been a bit too cold for me to goout, I needed a little something extra to put me overthe $25 total that was needed for FREE Shipping, andthanks to Amazon's Add-On Program, I got Goetze'sCaramel Creams! These were my favorite candy as achild, and I was happy to find them here on Amazon.The only negative comments I will leave is that theweight of the package was NOT large enough to equalONE POUND and the product was STALE ... The Sellerwas NOT happy with my 3-Star Review. I was being100% honest and saw no valid reason to change it.(The Customer is NOT always right with this Seller)"
1,AWFUL,"yuck, yuck, and yuck. I ate about three of them and tossed the rest. Don't even want to subject my tricker treaters to this GRAINY caramel! They are just weak and sugary....no sense of caramel at all!"
4,works as it should,I use the shopvac for my car and the filter pretty much keeps the vac's motor from dust and particles. I 'm sure it won't rank with a hepa filter but who cares when using it for cars or water pick ups?
1,Just horrible!!,"I open the box and the smell almost knocks you over it's so bad, and it doesn't go away either. It's in the rubber but even un-opened and still some plastic wrap on it, it's so awful you can't stand it.It smells like raw bug killer and makes you sick just having it in the house. I have to send this product back it's so bad, and I never send anything back.The part that bothers me is that they HAVE to know this, and send it out anyhow."
5,Good Price Fast Delivery,"Not a lot to say about a filter, it fit, was a good price and delivery was very quick.Should be ready for another one in about 6 months. Make sure to use your sleeve."
4,Fine Replacement Filter,"It's a filter folks, no much to say...it arrived quickly, fits, traps dirt, and is just like the original and cheaper from Amazon!"
5,Great OEM Shop Vac Filter,"I noticed that my Shop Vac Hang-Up Pro had stopped sucking very effectively. After cleaning out the hose that my teenage son used to suck up paper towels, I also noticed that the filter was FILTHY! I don't think I had changed it since I've owned this Shop Vac, so I came to Amazon and found this filter on the cheap. With Prime shipping, it was here in 2 days."
4,Funny. Definitely a fun vacation book,"I started reading this book during my vacation and once I started, I couldn't stop. It is SO entertaining! The characters are very vivid, they make an exciting bunch. The story is so hilarious that I found myself laughing out loud. I even made my husband read it and he was laughing too! This book will not make you smarter or give you some great insight in life. It will definitely grab your attention until its finished with you (or you're finished with it). I imagined there must be a group of friends like this in real life, and I wish I was a part of it. How exciting!! And yes, the ending does make you feel all warm and cozy. A necessity for a fun book.This is definitely a fun book to read while sunbathing by the pool."
5,Great Book,"This book is a great read. I found it thouroghly enjoyable from start to finish. If you aren't open-minded enough to hear about gay relationships I would not advise you to read this book. To everyone else, enjoy!"
1,Save Yourself!!,"If you want a book that completely makes no sense this is the one. The authors had a good topic to write about but none of the characters were fully developed. At certain points throughout the book you thought a great story was about to develop then the subject was just dropped. Too much detail was put into miniscuule things such as carpet or armchairs a bigger story could have been deve3loped in these situations but unfortunately all you had the pleasure of reading about was a ""lip-shaped chair"" I actually got this book for a ""bargain"" price but I truly regret it now. If you feel impelled to buy this book please just check it out of a library."
1,Wow; outdated or suited only for saddle seat advice maybe.,"Kind of funny actually. See page 17. Yikes. I had this as a kid and even then my instructor tried to throw it away on me. Just because one can ride one English discipline absolutely does not mean one has business giving out advice on ""English"". The authors should have stuck to saddle seat and there might be no issue."
3,A good start,This book is a good starter book that has a lot information for the new rep as well as for many factories that should read the book.If the new rep pays attention to many of the important points that their factory expects from a rep organization they will be ahead of some of the more seasoned rep firms that have been around for awhile.It is worth the small investment you will make and the ROI should be large if you follow most of the suggestions and ideas in the book.I would like to see the organization that wrote this book do a more up todate version as this book is at least 20 years old.
5,"Honesty, charity, and clarity!","Mark Shea is one of the most talented writers of Christian apologetics on the scene today. While this is more of a personal journey than a scholarly study, Mark is forceful and honest in his assessment of the evidence and compellingly clear in his presentation and arguments. After reading his work you either have to agree or disagree -- there is no room for ""Gee, that's nice"".A great read for anyone who is either considering the Catholic Church's claims or is convinced of the truth but struggling to explain it to others.Also recommended are Mark's ""Making Senses out of Scripture"" and ""By What Authority"". He can be found as a regular contributor on EWTN or on Catholic Exchange's website (where he does a regular PodCast)."
4,funny,"just a plain funny show.when you like the old tv shows as I love Lucy, you surely will like this show too."
2,GET RID OF THAT SAXOPHONE!!!!,"The saxophone on most of these songs ruins what could have been great country songs if they had been produced in the traditional vein. I especially like the last cut ""A New Love"" and wish it had been released as a single. This is strange because I don't usually like Reba's fast songs but there was something really neat and catchy about this one. ""Walk On"" is good too except for that Saxophone!!!"
3,A mix of C&W and more 'sophisticated' tracks,"Apparently this album charted highly about 10 years ago, and it is reasonably easy to see why. The early tracks are very much country and western in the Tammy ""Whinette"" style but the later ones are in a more contemporary style, all bound together by Reba's powerful delivery and those stretched vowel sounds. In the sleeve Reba describes this as a coming of age CD and it does contain a mix of styles in terms of tracks. Worth buying at a reduced price just for the very cleverly adapted and performed ""Cathy's Clown"" track."
1,A MERRY-GO-ROUND THAT MAKES YOU DIZZY!!,"Reba vascillates a lot with this one. If she is analagous to a sixteen year old with this effort then she hit the nail on the head because most sixteen year olds I know are very wishy-washy in all aspects of their lives. This CD is representative of that. We start off strong, then things quickly take a turn for the worse. I don't know from one minute to the next when I will be able to disembark from the merry-go-round of mixed up material here. I hear a saxophone sometimes, a steel guitar sometimes, a fiddle another time. SOme of it is good. Most of it is not!! I've heard better from McEntire!!!!"
3,HALF AND HALF,"They should have titled this album ""Half and Half"". Its half country, half pop, half the songs are good, the other half are just there to complete 10 songs. The good ones: Cathy's Clown, Til Love Comes Again, Walk On, It Always Rains on Saturday and Little Girl. The others are quite bad but the worst is the cut ""Say the Word"". I've never heard such an ugly tune in my life!!! Yuck!! I give this CD three stars but it really should be 2.5."
2,THERE ARE SOME GOOD SONGS ON HERE BUT SHE'S DONE BETTER!,"Reba has done way better.....(For My Broken Heart...the prime example). This is an album that contains some good songs....""A New Love"" (one of the few uptempo songs I like even though this one could hardly be classified as country, ""Walk On"" which would be dandy if it would have had a bluegrass arrangement and ""Cathy's Clown"" which features Reba in one of her most endearing performances. I also enjoyed thoroughly ""Til Love Comes Again"" and ""It Always Rains on Saturday"". I did not like ""Somebody up There LIkes Me"", ""Little Girl"" ""Say the Word"" or ""Am I the Only One Who Cares"". Two stars is enough."
3,"Nice, however not yellow","We wanted a true ""yellow"" bulb, this bulb is very bright however it is not the true yellow, it isyellow coated but when on it shines a light yellow and more of a white/chrome color. Item was shippedfast and we are using them however we will try and locate true yellow fog/driving lamps when these bun out."
2,Unhappy,"I did not like this CD at all. Very dissapointed with the song selections, so I returned it. I do not recommend that anyone purchase this CD. GRA"
5,iPod 4-in-1 is great!,"I recently purchased the iPod 4-in-1 super charger, and have used it regularly since. It provides four ways to charge your iPod (ac outlet plug, auto cigarette lighter, usb direct to computer, and 9 volt battery)all in one unit. I have used all but the 9 volt battery power input, and they all work quickly and easily. It is a great design, with even the power ac plug folding into the unit when not being used. I would strongly recommend this product to anyone considering its purchase."
1,Didn't work,None of connections worked when it arrived so i had to return it. Wishful thinking on my part that it would work for the price i paid.
1,Charging Plug Does Not Fit iPod Touch 5th Generation,"The description said that this item fits ""iPod 1st thru 5th Generations."" Not so! Imagine my surprise and disappointment when my daughter held the charging plug up against her new, 5th gen iPod Touch and showed me that the plug was too long for the iPod. It does fit earlier generations (at least 2nd gen). So, I gave the device away to a niece who has a 2nd generation iPod. I suppose one could buy an adapter to convert the large, 30-pin size to the smaller size of the latest generation iPod. But that sort of defeats the purpose."
1,"Seems OK, but. . . .","According to the product description, this is a replacement power supply for my HP zv6000 laptop. Unfortunately, my laptop will not work with this particular power supply. The problem could be with my computer, but I tend to think it isn't putting out enough juice. I've ordered an adapter that specifically mentions the 120 watt output.That said, I placed my order on Friday and received the product the following Wednesday - nice job."
4,Worked perfectly!,I was hesitate to order this power cord on line. I just wasn't sure if it would fit my laptop. I was pleasantly surprised that it came on time and worked perfectly. I will definitely be ordering future items from Amazon.com.
5,Excellent for the price...,"I bought this to replace the adapter for my wifes aging laptop. The price was awesome, and we have not had a bit of trouble out of it. I would highly recommend these for anyone needing a new adapter."
4,Great Music from the 50's and 60's,"If you are a fan of music from the 50's and 60's, particulary doo wop and rock and roll, you will enjoy this CD. Included are 25 songs that are sure to be remembered from this time period. However, I believe it is stretching it to entitle this CD ""The Millennium's Greatest Hits volume 1"" since it limits songs to the 50's and 60's. In order to live up to the title it has it would have had to include a number of George M. Cohan and Irving Berlin songs as well. You may not agree with all the songs that make the cut on this CD, I don't, but with a list of 25 songs I would choose most of them. This CD is a strong four stars and close to being five stars."
4,Probably the best oil cd,I have listened to this CD consistently since it came out and I haven't really gotten sick of it at all. I hope the next generation picks it up and comes to appreciate the musicianship and songwriting of one of the best 80-90s bands.
1,Weak Studio Session Effort From Distracted Band,"This is obviously just a studio album so the band members could fulfill a contractual obligation with the record company, or something along those lines. By this time in the band's career, some of the band members had other things going on, so they really didn't put out a lot of effort and practice and labor for this album. The songs are not fully fleshed out. The only time the band even remotely sounds like their old selves is the chorus of the song ""My country right or wrong."" Otherwise, there is not much here. They clearly had spent themselves in their first five amazing albums. They were awesome when they worked hard to be awesome.I bought this used for very cheap, and I still think I overpaid. I played it twice. I can't envision ever playing it again. I might play frisbee with it, that's about it."
4,Love it but...,"It's a great phone. I think all DECT 6.0 phones are great but this one take sthe cake. Uses regular AAA rechargables. I will not buy a phone that uses a proprietary battery. Crystal clear voice and the range of reception is outstanding.Two minor problems. If you answer in this phone and someone picks up an extension, this one disconnects. I have the base and one extension. The other problem is very minor. If the time a call is received is between 10PM and 10:59 PM, the time is shown in hexadecimal notation as 0a:00 thru 0a:59.They have told me they are working on a fix for the disconnect problem."
3,Bad Internal Clock,"Hi:I've been using this type of phone for a period of five years. It works fine except when I have to set the time for the alarm. The clock varies a lot each day, I don't know the reason but it is very annoying. For the rest of features has a good perfomance."
1,very bad service,"veru bad service, they only sent me 1/2 of the products, and i dont can do nothing with they,the item they sent me, doesnt works without the other part, so i lost money.I wrote them, but they didnt answer me."
3,siemens S45,Bought this phone after extensive research. Wanted a DECT phoneGood product. The clock is always incorrect! Delay of few minutes every day
3,Mediocre phone not worth the money,"I purchased this phone because my other cordless phones have static issues related to my router. In this regard, the Siemens S45 DECT 6.0 performs well and I have yet to have router issues. I also like the long range I get with this phone. I've got a two acre yard and can go almost anywhere on my land and still get a decent signal. On the down side, the handset's battery runs down rapidly. In addition, the voice volume changes erratically while you are having a conversation. Like another review noted, the party you are talking with doesn't appear to notice the changes, but they are annoying nonetheless. Also, the phone's clock looses a few minutes every week. I'm constantly having to update the time on it. It makes me angry that I spent more than $100 on a phone with such major flaws. My advice is to avoid this DECT 6.0 and try your luck with another brand."
1,Don't buy this phone!,"This phone is ridiculously expensive and it's been nothing but problematic since we bought it last December. Siemens has replaced our phones (we're still waiting for the last one), but now it's a new set of problems. At first it was an issue of the thing keeping time (you have to set the time, unlike many other phones that get it ""magically""). Now the phone is beeping at random times and the company is slower than molasses to resolve the issues. Defintely save your money and buy a cheaper phone!"
2,I Returned This Phone System,"The graphics are lots of fun and my kids loved the intercom. However, the call waiting does not work at all. You have to hang up on the first call to take the second call. And I couldn't get the message light to work on any of the three handsets I had to let me know that I had received a voicemail message. These are basic functions that an expensive system like this should handle well. I also fund the system to be over complicated. Too many steps to review the call log, add phone numbers to the stored list, etc."
1,Terrible features,"Try getting a list of folks who called, its impossible. The memory gets full for caller ID gets full ( very quickly) and doesn't let callers leave messages on the machine..very disappointed with the Siemen engineers, what were they thinking!"
2,Missing pieces,We got this for our 6 year old son as a Xmas present.It was missing about 5 pieces of which 2 were critical for building the car. The car never ever got builtbecause of the missing pieces. My son was very disappointed in the Jeff Gordon car. Jeff Gordon is his favorite driver.Now he did like the little Jeff Gordon guy with his little cool racing helmet.
1,AGAIN ... WHY???????????????,"This is exactly the thing that begs the question WHY????????????its no different from the other karaoke tribute albums to coldplay, the worst being ""metal tribute to coldplay"".Other than to milk more money from imbeciles who spend money blindly... this is the worst form of imitation... reducing coldplay's music to elevator muzak (see all the so called tribute albums listed on amazon)sigh"
1,Who ARE these people?,"I've never heard of any of the acts performing the songs.I'll stick with the real thing, thanks!"
1,Too bad to even be funny.,"This is simply awful. Its so bad it flirts with funny, but the badness crushes any humor that could be found in it. You know how professional wrestling is funny for about 15 seconds, and then its just pathetic? Well, this has that same quality. Listen to the samples - then feel your skin crawl - and that's all you'll ever need from this album. I wish it had that unique quality of badness (like Bloodsport or Roadhouse or something) to give it a better ranking, but it doesn't. It's worse than bad karaoke. It's worse than herpes."
1,I'm embarassed,This compilation is an embarassment to the artists who compiled it with such banal unoriginality.
2,If your looking for some unique artist interpretations...,"Im a hugeee coldplay fan since the begining, and i've been watching for anything coldplay related, esp a dvd or trubute, when i listened to this cd, i was unimpressed. I was hoping for some unique artist interpretations of coldplay's songs. Coldplay's music is i admit hard to top, but artist renditions should be more creative, I wouldnt recommend this cd."
2,What's up with this album?,Is the music label so desperate to cash on Coldplay music as much as they can? Or maybe these artists on this album are friends of Coldplay? Whatever it is Coldplay is such a great band so there is really no need for anyone to do interpretation of their music at least not yet. Forget this album and get the real stuff from Coldplay.
2,Why settle for something inferior to the real thing?,"This CD is full of exact covers of original Coldplay songs. The artists that perform on this album don't put any spin on the songs really, and all of the vocalists don't compare to Chris Martin. Stick with the Coldplay originals."
1,Why not just get the real Coldplay CD's...,"Allright, seriously. I have the String Quartet Tribute to Coldplay where they take Coldplay melodies and sort of rework them in a new interesting way. That stuff is good to listen to for studying or something where you don't want words. But this: the songs are pretty much just covers. They sound like Coldplay songs, almost the same, but simply not as good and not real. Its a bunch of crap, really. Do yourself a favor: buy Parachutes and Rush of Blood to the Head, but stay away from this crappy tribute."
1,No comparrision,"These are horrible covers. I would much rather listen to Chris Martin sing. Do not waste your money. At the very least you'd think they'd do something original, or make the song their own, but no. Same songs but with annoying vocals. Painful to listen to."
1,Truncated version of original release,When this recording was 1st released in the late 70's it contained an appendix of Milnes and Cossoto singling the arias from the 1847 version that were replaced in 1867. During the 80's these were omitted in a re-release so that the opera would fit on 2 vinyl discs. There is plenty of space on these CD's for the missing material to be restored. As far as I know the missing arias have never been released on CD. Shame on you EMI for leaving out material from the original release. This one more instance of CD releases of older recordings with edits and missing bonus material. It's one of the reasons I'm forced to hang onto my original vinyl pressings. It just shows that the Music Industry has precious little regard for the recorded heritage they hold in stewardship for future generations.
1,crap,lasted 7 months lifting 225#. relunctantly bought a replacement and it did not work at all out of the box! crap. do not buy!
5,Good cable for zip line,This is a great zip line that will be used for my grand kids in my back yard. It is a great product at a great price. Thanks
4,hi ho silver,was glad to purchase this as a new lone ranger fan haven't watched any episodes yet but will soon i especially love the tin box it was the main reason i purchased the item. My only complant is that one of the disc was out of the sleeve when i opened the box but other than that it's cool.
3,La serie de mi niñes,"Muy contento por tener algunos capítulos de esta gran serie de hace muchos años, por fin vi la génesis del Llanero Solitario (lone Ranger). Buena imagen, sonido y por supuesto historia que muestra que el bien siempre debe triunfar sobre el mal, sin que el héroe tenga que matar a los malos. Lamento que esta serie (y ninguna del mismo personaje hasta donde yo se) no tenga subtítulos en español. ¿Cuándo se le ocurrirá a alguien producir esta serie y otras más pensando en el público de habla hispana?"
1,"Night Fever that isn't quite ""night"" and isn't fever at all.",I could make better compilation from my old cassettes.It doesn't sound like Enigma at all - some garage-made mixture of not-really-great songs. Very disappointing...
3,Kulture Kids,"An exhaustive (and exhausting) cross between a fan-rave and a dissertation examining the history and pop-ological intricacies of the brief but very influential rod-and-custom period in America.Although it is chock full of details and insights into the subject one wonders who exactly it was written for. It often seems much too highbrow and academic for the average kid or gear-head, and I'm sure most academes wouldn't be seen reading anything with so many ""purdy pichures"". You're left with the impression that it in fact began as a scholarly defense (always check who the publisher is) which, once it appeared to have legs, was tricked out with some chrome and kandy kolors to help find it's way onto American coffee tables.Still it is well worth having to glean ( for practiced speed readers ) ever more minutia about an era that always spawns endless nostalgia for fans, and eventually, a true sociological and anthropological exegesis for 22 century rustmites."
1,bad,"I got this thinking it was a hip hop type workout that would really get my heart rate up. I did all 4 workouts (which are maybe 10 minutes each) and I didn't even break a sweat, and I definitely didn't get my heart rate up. So if you are looking for a workout, dont get this"
1,Too Repetitive To Be Enjoyable,"Completely disappointing. The mustachioed Carlos Llanos leads about 15 people through the same routine from the warmup about 1000 times.The warmup acts as a primer/foundation where the steps for the workout are taught and mastered. The music is great. It lulls you into false hope.Once the cardio begins you wonder if your DVD is broken. It's the exact same thing as the warmup. It is agonizing getting through it because everything is re-taught as if the warmup didn't exist at all. In addition, in between each repetition of the same routine there is an absurd amount of pointless marching. Due to this marching, it was impossible to keep up a good heart rate.The moves had great promise and the music was great. But even the dancers seemed bored, and I lost interest completely. It's cheap, but you get what you pay for."
5,"All that is edible from a bee hive (& more), it's here","I think this is an acquired taste, quite intense and flavorful but fortunately sweet.As for ingredients: Royal jelly, check. Raw honey, check. Bee pollen, check. Propolis, check. Korean ginseng, check.Korean ginseng is on the Warm side of the Chinese qi system and that alone should give you more energy. That's why I normally consume American ginseng which is on the Cold side. But the former is probably better for winter months."
4,excellent customer service,"when first receiving the product, the plastic bottle was damaged during shipping, I guess it's because the packaging wasnt that good.Then I called the customer service and got a new bottle shipped to me without any problem, very excellent customer service, will do bussiness with them again!"
1,Deluxe Alphabet Stamp Set,It comes in a nice packaging with a wooden tray to house the loose pieces. Unfortunately the letterings were too big for my usage.
3,Melissa and Doug Alphabet Stamps,"I bought this for my 8 year old daughter, thinking that she would spend hours using this stamp set. She likes to scrapbook and decorate. But unfortunately, she has only used it twice. But her preference is stickers over stamps in general because stamps can be messier. I like the quality of the product and how both capital and lowercase letters are available. It can also be used as an educational tool to help children practice spelling. But I also feel that the price is slightly higher than I would've liked to pay."
4,Good quality wooden stamps,"We like the stamps a lot but they do not come with a lid, so once they are opened and the plastic film is removed there is no cover to keep them all in the nice wooden box. Wish they would have a plexiglass lid that slids in from one side."
4,"Nice, but the packaging leaves much to be desired.","These stamps are great. Awesome quality, perfect size, easy to use. However, the packaging leaves a lot to be desired. The box itself is fine, but doesn't come with a lid. It's also IMPOSSIBLE for little (and big) fingers to get the stamps out. I had to dump them and then re-arrange them back in the box once my daughter finished with them. If they had given a tiny bit of extra space on the sides, it would work out perfect. As it is, it doesn't and I had to knock of a star for that.Our stamps are now in a plastic bag."
2,Very small stamps,"Stamps are about the size of a small ice cube and could cause a chocking hazard to children that put things in their mouths, box has large empty space under cardboard logo card. A little small if you ask me."
4,Kids love it!,"Good quality stamps. I just wish the box had a lid of some kind. Overall the box is just a weird design, but the product itself is good."
5,Creative purchase!,"What can I say other than Melissa and Doug have done it again. Are they known for making a bad product? My son & daughter are getting hours of enjoyment with this stamp set. My daughter is of 4 yrs of age and beginning to sound out words, learn to spell and is always asking me to spell words. Instead of practicing penmanship she is stamping the words. Great way to build motor skills!"
3,"Good idea, but a bit impractical for storage","I purchased this product for my 5 year old, thinking she would love making words from the stamps, since she is enjoying learning to write her words. I do not buy many electronic toys and value the quality of Melissa and Doug products, and have purchased many of their toys. Unfortunately, this one sits in a bin of toys, unused. She liked it for a day or so, but I think it might need to be a toy that she uses with a little bit of supervision. It has so many stamp pieces that if not taken care of well, they can be easily misplaced. Depending on where it is stored, it's probably best in a ziploc bag or box. I love the idea, and perhaps she will use it at some later point."
4,nice toy,"I love these stamps for my 2 year old. He loves them too. They are sturdy, made of solid wood with a durable rubber mold. The stamp set allows us to teach our son uppercase and lowercase letters and a few punctuation marks as well. My only problem with these stamps is that they are laborsome for a 2 year old to take out put back into their box. There's really no good solution for this problem though considering there are 56 different stamps. The positive about this perceived problem is that it makes him work more on his fine motor skills, and his patience, as well as his dad's patience. haha."
4,Great product...but ink pad could be better.,"The product, as a whole, is great. My daughter enjoys creating cards with it. Just one complaint...the ink pad is not that great. It has very little ink (or has dried while waiting for us to buy it)."
3,Two things I would change...,My kids like this stamp set however in my opinion there are two minor product flaws. The first is that the stamps are too difficult for my kids' little fingers to get out of the box. We have to dump them all out each time they want to use them. The second is that the box does not have a lid which makes storage challenging.
4,Nice stamps,"I like this set of stamps because it comes lowers case and upper case letters. The only thing I don't like or makes it difficult for my daughters and she gets frustrated is when she puts the letter back on the box it is hard, it becames a mess beacuse the space it's tiny and difficult to out them inside the box..mommy need sto do it for her."
3,"Much fun for the kids, not so much for the parents",The children have fun with the stamps. The parents not so much because the colour is not only on the paper. It would be useful if a sponge would come with this set in order to clean the stamps from one colour and use another one.
5,Beautifully played by the inventor of the string quartet,"I can not stop listening to anything recorded by the Takacs Quartet lately, and these cd's are no exception. I do not own the import double disc, but have the two separate discs with 1-3 on one and 4-6 on the other. That may be cheaper than this disc. I'm not sure. Anyways, as far as the music and recording goes I don't know that it gets much better that this. Like I said it seems to me anything the Takacs' touch turns to gold. The are extremely great players with a very intense sound. If you are a fan of Haydn I would seriously look into getting these quartets. They are arguably some of the most beautiful quartets written. Although I don't really like to compare music like that. But just listening to these pieces puts a smile on my face."
5,Outstanding Neopolitan Baroque,"Francesco Durante was both a product of & a teacher at the great music schools of Naples, which was for a time to music what Florence had been to painting & sculpture centuries earlier. Durante was one of the leading lights of Naples, but because he wrote mostly religious music, no operas & little orchestral music he has been all but forgotten. So much of Italian music of the mid 1700's has a certain sameness to it. These concerti however are outstanding. Both joyous & deeply moving, they seem, when compared to the music of his contemporaries, to be strangly futuristic."
4,Good Starter Book,"Gene Sloane has wrote some great repair books and all of his books are packed with history, practical advice, and personal andecdotes.This book is a good all around introduction to cycling that will last you for several years. It is NOT the Last or Only book you will ever need (or want) on Cycling, but it is better than most. I have a collection of Gene's books and they are easily superior to Rob VanDerPlas's series (RVP tends to miss a few things in his books and can be too general in his coverage). Having copies of Gene's books over the years is like having a private library of the history of modern (1960s-2000s) bikes and the evolution of their design.He also tends to include gearing tables, sizing recommendations, metrics to english conversion charts, etc."
3,Historical Value,"If you ride vintage steel, you'll find this very informative. If not, not. And yes, he's pompous. Buy it as cheaply as possible. (I own an earlier edition.)"
1,25th edition not worth the money,"Don't buy the 25th Edition!!! I have the 1974 edition and just purchased a used copy of the same edition for a friend. Mistakenly I also purchased the newest, 25th edition. The 25th edition is a poor quality publication that appears to be compiled by amateurs. The photos are all grainy and the additional text provides no new information."
2,WiFi doesn't work,This printer prints ok through the USB connection but the wireless part does not work. The wifi indicater does not light up at all and my router doesn't even see the printer. I had to call Lexmark and they determined after having me do several things that the wireless part is defective. Lexmark is sending me a brand new free upgrade to the X4550 model. I would NOT RECOMMEND this printer if you want to use the wireless printing. Do yourself a favor and get something better.
1,Hardware + Software Problems,"Just tried to install this on an Apple (box says it's compatible). I ran into two issues.Software Issues:Problem one is that when hooked up via USB it acts like it's printing, but pages from Word/Excel come out blank. Test pages print out OK. Other programs such as Adobe Reader & Preview shut themselves down automatically when I tried to print from this printer.Hardware Issues:Wi-Fi is regularly defective with the Z1420 (regardless of if you're running a PC or Mac). When talking to technical support about this issue they didn't take too long to tell me, ""to be frank with you, a lot of the wireless cards are defective in the Z1420"".When the wireless card is defective they have a common practice of upgrading to the X4550, which is an All-In-One...If that works well I'll be happy with Lexmark the company, but still be annoyed with the Z1420 printer."
1,What a nighmare!!,"I originally purchased the the Lexmkar Z1420 after reading many positive reviews. For the first 4 months this printer worked great, but then randomly one day the wireless connection went. After about 3 painful hours on the phone with technical support they decided that it was broken and decided to send me a new upgraded printer. When that arrived a hooked it up and everything seemed fine, until I tried to print!! The new printer did not work!! I am so disgusted wiht Lexmark I will never buy their products again. In addition the guy at my work who does all of our computer stuff said their products really are crap. So please please do yourself a favor and spend the extra 20 or 30 dollars and get a better printer. I would not want anyone to go though the miserable experience I had between faulty printers and poor customer support."
1,Wireless Worthless,This printer was a dud. After installing and removing the driver seven times including a vista update twice it never printed anything meaningful and no response from lexmark support service so it was duly returned for a refund.I'll be avoiding this brand in the future.CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!!!!
1,Don't buy Lexmark Z1420,"The Z1420 will only allow you to use Genuine Lexmark cartridges (no refills) and their cartridges are twice the price of 'compatible cartridges' for other printers. Lexmark Tech Support confirmed. If you dont mind exhorbantely high priced ink costs, then this may be your printer!"
2,Not at all what I thought it would be,I was very excited to be able to print WIFI! I received the printer and was able to print with the USB cord but it would not connect to my router (belkin) I called Lexmark and they said it was my router to call them.. I called Belkin they said it was Lexmark... This went on for 2 days.. just as I was giving up I decided to connect the router to my laptop and try again. With the router plugged into my laptop the printer was able to connect to it. I don't have a desktop and am very disappointed that the only way I can print is to have the router connected to my laptop... this defeats the purpose of wireless!!!!
2,"WiFi doesn't work, but...","The WiFi on our unit does not work. The light doesn't even light up. We can only print through the USB. Called Tech Support, they're upgrading us to an X4550, no charge and very little hassle (apparently this is a problem they're used to seeing). If you don't mind dealing with Tech Support, give this printer a shot. Either it will work fine (the print quality on ours is okay, not presentation quality) or they will upgrade you to a better model that does work, for free. Can't beat that."
2,NO Workie on Toshiba Satellite Laptop,"after 4-1/2 hours with Lexmark tech-support... they could NOT get the printer to function wirelessly on my Toshiba-Satellite 1905-S301 (WinXP-sp3)(btw: printer setup & workd flawlessly on Dell-4600 desktop (WinXP-sp3)Print quality is average for documents. Speed is very good.Color images ..just OK .... ... This is NOT a Photo printer...so ,,, make your own conclusion.chat support 5 ***** for efforts/w design -1 star for impementation... as always .... YMMV ..( if buy ... confirm return / replacement priviledge."
1,Poor Service,"I ordered this product for it's color and Wifi capability. It arived with a crack in the body, would not print and could not be installed on my wireless network. Amazon is charging me to return it."
1,Bad product,"Had to return this printer. Power button was defective, wireless connectivity was unusable, and the included color cartridge was defective. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,This product should be withdrawn,"1. WI-FI in Z1420 did not work. The WI-FI light was lifeless.2. After several attempts to setup Z1420 as network printer,I ended up calling Lexmark supportSaturday , 10/4/2008 , Service call - 11204244333. The tech. informed that this is a known issue.4. They replaced Z1420 with Z2420Hassle in this process was to call support , repack , setup new printer again. But I was able to setup new Z2420 without any problem.I hope noone else goes through this hassle"
1,Printer review - problems with set-up,"I bought the printer because most of the reviewers found it easy to set up with their computers. My daughter has a mac book laptop. We were not able to set up the printer wirelessly. We were able to make it print for a while using the wire, but then that stopped too. I had to pay a computer specialist to download some extra software to make the printer work with the mac book."
2,"DIDN""T WORK",I was excited about the whole wireless printing concept until I received my printer and spent 3 hours of my precious time with technical support. They said I have a faulty something and there sending me another printer...ok
5,Solid wireless printer,"The Lexmark Z1420 has proven to be a perfect wireless printer add-on for my lakehouse wireless network. Established communication instantly with my Netgear wireless router, and all wireless PCs on the network linked up with the printer first time. Printer speed and print quality is fine, especially given the low price I paid for this product."
5,Setup of Z1420,"I just recently purchased 2 computers; one Mac and one Dell; to add to my existing WiFi network. I had been using an HP all in one and wanted to be able to print with all of my computers on it through the WiFi network. I purchased a Linksys print server and ended up with a day of frustration. The Linksys software crashed both my new Dell and my old computer and it was worthless with respect to the Mac. I ended up returning it for this Lexmark printer. The setup for this printer was flawless. Not only on the PCs, but the Mac as well. Total time was about 20 minutes. I don't know about how the printer will last over time, but I would recommend the folks who don't have WiFi printing as yet (HP and Canon) to copy the ease of setup."
1,lexmark z1420,"product was defective on arrival, however lexmark replaced the unit with an upgraded model x4550 that works awesome. lexmark has excellent customer service that strives to satisfy the customer. very happy with the x4550 model. easy to set up and very good copy quality. do not buy the z1420, for 20 dollars more on amazon get the x4550 which has print, scan and copy along with other features that make it a much better buy."
1,It is ethically questionable to take money from a person for this product.,"This printer is an absolute atrocity. Even when I put only a single page in the tray, the likelihood of ending up with a complete, undamaged piece of paper with legible print in the end is extremely low. Two or more pages in the tray at once is impossible; you are more likely to end up with origami than a printed document. As an added bonus, the driver constantly told me that my ink was low(in a voice louder than any other sounds at a given volume, for some reason) despite no issues with ink. The wi-fi is iffy.I'll give it a star because when I pounded it with my fists, all the pieces stayed in place."
1,the worst printer i ever had...,"I just decided to throw it away after months of hassle. it seemed to me as great solution to go wireless but it never really works. i have it connected to an imac. difficult set up. every time i need to print, i need at least 3 tries until i succeed. i dont have the patience anymore. never lexmark again."
1,"WiFi failure right out of the box, poor support","Was excited to get this printer, set it up, it has a hardware failure in its WiFi access according to Lexmark support. Typical offshore tech support, everything takes longer as communication is more difficult, don't know state abbreviations used in addresses (since I already provided a zip code you would think they could decode city and state without needing me to spell it slowly...). Needed me to fax proof of purchase (from earlier this week!) but could settle for forwarding copy of Amazon invoice. Hassle, hassle, hassle. Now I wait...."
1,"Misleading product listing, terrible design","I purchased this printer because I needed a wireless printer that would fit into a tight space: on a bookshelf that is eight inches deep. Amazon's product listing reports that this printer is 7.8 inches deep, which was the primary reason I picked it.I just unboxed the printer and placed it on the shelf. It fits beautifully... unless I want to plug it into the power. The way the power works for this printer is that you have to plug a big power brick into the back of the printer and then plug a power cord into the the back of the brick. All of this adds another 4.5 inches to the depth of this printer.Someone at Lexmark should be fired for this idiotic design.How well does the printer work? I have no idea... first I need to install a deeper shelf before I can actually use the printer."
1,would not work for me,"Would not connect to network, mfg. replaced with another one that also would not connect to network?"
1,A major disappointment,"I'm a recent owner of the Shop Vac Hang Up Pro with the 4.5HP motor. There's virtually nothing on my garage floor (dry) that does NOT clog up this pathetic little (in diameter) hose. I'm incredibly frustrated and disappointed with this purchase. Stay away from it. Naively, I thought that the motor was the most important component and didn't even think about hose diameter. Stupid me. Stupid Shop Vac. Idiots."
3,Small and compact - good but not perfect.,"I like the small size and simple design of this unit. It also has enough power for most things. Biggest problem is the small hose. It gets clogged VERY easy, and is difficult to clear. My Dad has a craftsman version which has a hose that is one size larger and he does not have these issues.If your primary purpose is cleaning your car or occasionally sucking up some dirt this is a great unit. I would not recommend this for a workshop where you are trying to pick up lots of sawdust or other particulate that clogs easily."
2,weak for wood shop,OK for general dust collection but noisy. Clogs easily on wood chips. I was pretty dissapointed for my application. Might be Ok in a garage for cars but overall not very powerful for all the noise it produces. Look elsewhere
4,"Great suction, short cord!","Living in a forest and with 7 indoor cats, I needed a shop vac that could really suck up the constant fur shed, scattered dry catfood, and the leaf mold that's always being tracked in. This little vac is handy, compact, and works great at getting up everything in its path. I'm very pleased with that aspect. However, although the hose is quite long (a bit too long; it's rather unwieldy at times), the power cord is too short. If the hose and cord lengths were more equal, the vac would be perfect. Still, for the price and power, it's a good shop vac and does the job I need it to do."
3,Noisy operation,"The vacuum works great as far as the suction, mounting and supplied accessories and was a good value in those regards. However, even though the motor itself is not overly loud, when you attach the long hose it creates a loud high pitched whistling sound (with many of the attachments) probably caused from the air pulling through the corregated hose. This makes it irritating when used for any period of time."
3,weak hose,This vac does not have as much of suction for a 4.5 hp.Also 18 foot hose is weak and seems it would break easily.
4,Not a bad vac,"Bought this to take the place of my 5-gal Rigid that stil works fine, just wanted to free up some floor space in the garage. Not a bad vac for the money and Amazon was a lot cheaper than the other stores I had shopped. It does what it says it does. It sucks! I think most folks will like it."
5,Shop-Vac Wall Mount,"This is working great. I needed something light weight for the pantry, laundry and walkway, so I could vacuum when needed. The tank hangs in the corner and I can easily reach all the areas I need to clean up, just carrying the light weight hose around. This is great!"
3,a little dissapointing,I have been using this shop-vac for a couple of years now and I have never been very impressed. It feels cheap and the motor sounds like it may come apart at any minute.
4,Good except for two things.,"This unit is good. It would be great if 1) the hose never clogged and 2) adapters for mating the 1"" hose to 1-1/4"" and other sizes were readily available. Those cut to size adapters don't work - wasted $10 on one."
4,"Good Power, Portable, But Very Loud","Been using it to vacuum up dust on a big painting job. The power is great, the long hose means I sit the canister in the middle of the room and easily reach all the spots I need. It's got good suction for when my basement floods too, although at 5 gallons it won't pump out a lake. My only complaint is that it's very loud. If I use it for more than a few minutes I wear a headset. Still, I consider it a great buy and would buy it again."
1,Not a good choice,I bought this vac at Lowes. it is very underpowered. The hose clogs with small debris in my small garage shop. It is very loud.Do yourself a favor and spend more for a better machine.
4,Small but powerful,"I bought this vac because I only have my 2 car garage to make sawdust in so everything must move aside to get the cars in. What a great vac in a small package! It's out of the way on the wall yet the hose is long enough to reach anywhere I need it. I'm sure there are more powerful vacs available but when you consider price, size and ability this vac is quality at a value price"
3,"seems to work okay, but . . . . .","This thing arrived today and I was a little suprised when I opened the box. Guess I was expecting it to be a little more similar to the shop vac I have owned for over 10 years now. Quality of materials and design is in no way comparable to my old machine. The included accessories are a little on the junky side. But it does do its job and it is a ""Shop-Vac"". We'll see if this one lasts 10 years trouble-free, as the old one has. Guess it's just a sign of the times. Costs have to be cut to stay competitive in our ""throw-away"" society."
3,"Convenient, but loud and hose is prone to clogging","I've had this little vacuum for 4 years now, and it has been up on the garage wall for 2. I use it mostly to clean up the sawdust around the miter saw. It does a great job with that. The convenience of having it out of the way and up on a wall cannot be overstated. But it is loud (I use ear protection when it's running!), and the hose does clog often when e.g. I am vacuuming bigger things such as leaves, pieces of paper."
3,wall mount vacuum,"Excellent product as far as portability. Love the wall mount feature, long cords also making using it an ease. Suction tube is too narrow and is susceptible to clogging. Otherwise an excellent product."
2,important accessory not included,"My unit did not include many of the accessories shown in the Amazon product page photo. To hook the vacuum hose to a table saw, think you will need to purchase an additional accessory (I burned some gas to visit the local hardware store)."
1,HAS NO SUCTION POWER,"I bought this shop vac hoping to use it to sweep up bird seeds, cat & dog hair. It really doesn't have the suction necessary to pick up more than a few feathers! I was very disappointed and I can not get help from Amazon making a return so I must be stuck without a refund!!"
5,Low Kick & Hard Bop,"This cd is hard to fit into existing genres, although there are quite some similarities with Solex 'Low Kick and Hard Bop'. Imagine samples from the mono-area somewhere down in the fifties, think be-bop and rock a billy. Think Yonderboi with balls, think cracky old grammophones without the cracks, sampled and supported with traditional instruments (drums, bass, guitar, organ) Think mono-retro, think about cajun music, think avant-garde jazz, in a chaotic manner, think drum 'n bass unplugged, in mono, played by jazz musicians. This is not mainstream music, it's more like a dusty road through a mangrove landscape. The title of Solex' album pretty much describes Kaada's music in it's best: Low Kick & Hard Bop. Go for it if you're into something completely different."
3,Interesting but somewhat lacking,"I read several reviews on this album and decided to pick it up just to see for myself. This is a very creative and interesting album indeed, yet one I will probably not listen to very often. The songs are fun, but just is something lacking; perhaps substance. I do really like 'No You Don't' and you can find its video on Ipecac's website (the label). I like the surf vibe in 'Mainframe', but I still think he could have did more with it. Some of the songs are just annoying or boring though. The cut-n-paste feel reminds me of Eat Static's 'Crush and Burn' ablum. I can't say I wish I did not buy the album because there is some decent stuff on it. Hopefully, his next album will be more developed."
3,More attempts then triumphs,Some interesting ideas and a few bona fide masterful tracks do not keep the majority of material here unable to transcend DJing roots. A few songs which effortlessly merge Motown vocals with the experimental beats stand out amongst more half-composed works which still offer enough interesting background-for-thought to make the work stand out.
3,a few really cool songs but.....,most of this album is either fairly mediocre or really pretty repetive and boring. and I can't say I'd recommend buying it at full price or anything.
1,Incorrect translator - BEWARE,"This is NOT the Burton Raffel translation. This is actually the Francis B. Gummere translation. Indo-European Publishing is actually an e-publishing house. Their website tells you all about how you can have your own book published, but I don't see where they actually sell books (like this one) on their website. I paid $16.95 for this illegitimate Raffel translation when I should have bought the Signet version for $4.95. Worse than that, though, was that my son struggled all summer trying to trudge through this Gummere version, when the Raffel translation is a much easier read. Be careful purchasing books issued from unfamiliar publishing houses!"
1,"The End of the ""Queen of Disco"" and the beginning of a born again Christian","This is a sad record... Gloria Gaynor became a ""born-again"" Christian shortly before doing this album and changed the lyrics of ""I Will Survive"" from 'I took all the strength I had not to fall apart' - to 'Only the Lord could give me strength not to fall apart'. Ironically, the ""Queen of Disco"" had fallen a prey to the brainwashing campaign of the conservatives (e.g. the Reagen revolution) who made ""disco"" a dirty word and turned their backs about the multiculturalism and liberalism of the 1970's in an attempt to bring back the 1950's. Gloria Gaynor's last great album was 1981's I Kinda Like Me... she would never be the same after that..."
3,Love The Rack - Not Happy with Amazon's Description,"This rack is a different color (brownish color) instead of black.My vehicle - Red & Black with a black rack, one black sprocket rocket and a brown one - i think not - Returning the product back to Amazon."
5,A Great Way to Learn and Practice Ericksonian Hypnosis Language .,"The authentic Zebu Cards as Robert Anue first published them. As a NLP Practitioner and Trainer, I use these cards in my seminars to support and expand on the Milton Model language skills. A great fun and portable game that will get you thinking, speaking and influencing in a whole different way."
5,Great quality product,"The pattern is not an easy one, but the kit contains very detailed instructions useful for begginers, the threads are perfectly organized and the key color schemes are easy for the eyes to read. It's not a big one, but very beautiful. I would recommend it both for beginners and experts."
5,The true man at last-not some pious pseudomonk,"This must ,by far, be the best writing of Merton.It is intense, it is heart-rending and it is REAL!His illict love affair carried on whilst suppossed to be under vows of celibacy and obedience show that Merton was after all like us.Had the same struggles as us and got himself into the same shameful muddles, as we do.If you want a book you can't put down- buy this journal.If you already have problems of your own this book could help you to logically find your way through those tangled feelings"
5,"Petey Weetstraw, R&amp;amp;B's son -in- law!","This album is the bomb! I've been a fan of L. Young aka Petey Weetstraw ever since I caught him at an L.A. club doing an open mic night that soon turned into his concert because no one wanted him to leave the stage. There is a song for every one on this CD. It is truly some of the best writng and production I've heard in R&B for years. My personal favorite is Come N Get It this week, but every song on this album is so infectious that it'll change next week. No, I'm not L's publicist or personal friend...just a geeky white boy who is a fan of good music. This is a definite stocking stuffer!"
2,Sexual Healing,"I purchased this book to help me with a sexual problem that most likely stemmed from a former relationship. After reading the full book as is recommended by the author, it was then that I discovered the book is really meant to be used with a partner. Well, if your problem stems from getting a partner in the first place, then this book is really only somewhat useful. It can achieve relaxation techniques and proper breathing exercises but that really doesn't go far in treating the problem for which I originally purchased the book. I am now considering enrolling in a Yoga class for even better relaxation and try to leave my love/sex life in the past where it was before I read the book."
5,Outstanding,"this is a great novel about the American Civil War. Powerful and authentic, it deal with many issues that were present during the war. The characters are fully realized, and the situations gripping.What is incomprehensible is how the publisher allowed it to sink without a trace. This could have been a big seller, if not a best-seller, and is the kind of book that should be taught in our schools."
2,SOME SONGS ARE GOOD BUT I WOULDN'T BUY THIS!,"There are some songs on this one that are o.k. But they'll never come close to being ""classic"" country songs like ""How Blue"" and ""Somebody Should Leave"". I did like ""I'm a New Fool at an Old Game"" and ""Silly Me"" but for the most part, I wouldn't have bought this if I had known what was on it."
1,TURNING POINT FOR REBA ..SHE LEFT TRADITIONAL COUNTRY.,"In her own words, ""I want to what sells"". Obviously, traditional country wasn't selling enough for Miss McEntire so she compromised what made her so appealing and released this CD of POP songs. She began the turn back to the traditional movement, got tired and and turned to POP which is the same venue she has continued in since she released this CD in 1988. I remember when I bought it, I thought, ""where are the fiddles? Where are is the steel?"" Look for none...you won't find any here. Some of the songs are o.k. but not as good as the traditional work which is what Reba does best. Nothing she has done since (with the possible exception of ""For My Broken Heart"" can top her traditional era. Sadly, I don't think we'll ever see that from her again."
1,I KNEW WE WERE IN TROUBLE,"WHEN she started off with So, So Long...a terrible song with nary a fiddle or steel on it. Then she went into ""Sunday Kind of Love"" which is a torch song which Reba simply cannot do!! Crystal Gayle could have done wonders with this one! Reba failed miserably. I did like ""I Know How He Feels"" and ""New Fool at an Old Game"" but the rest of it is just pop fluff...like stale cotton candy. The worst of the lot is RESPECT!! Awful!!"
2,THIS ONE BROKE THE REBA MOLD,"You've heard the saying, if it aint broke don't fix it?? Then you'll understand why I'm giving this album only 2 stars because all of the songs here broke away from Reba's traditional country music stance, a stance she pioneered and led people back to when they were straying away from country. Then she turned around and did exactly what those people who were straying were doing. In doing so, she broke the mold that made her who she is. Nothing here on this album can justify that. There are a couple of good tunes on this but for the most part, it leaves a sour taste in your mouth."
1,REBAS ENTRY INTO POP FORUM MISSES ALL THE WAY!,"This CD marked the end of Reba's traditional phase which was a sad day for country music. Everything she has done since then has missed the mark in my book. ""So, So Long"", the first cut has a terrible melody. ""Do RIght by Me"" sounds like it came out of the 1960s girl group. ""I'm A New Fool"" is o.k. ""Sunday Kind of Love"" just downright leaves me quesy. ""And Still"" is borring!! The rest ...I won't even mention here. Sadly, this CD was just the beginning of more lackluster CDs to come from this talented lady."
1,BAD MOVE,"When Reba ventured into the pop field with this release she said in her autobiography that this album did not lend itself to steel and fiddles. It would have been far better if it had. I can picture and hear ""New Fool at an Old Game"" or ""Silly Me"" or the other ballads with new production in a traditional vein that would have made these songs stand out!! ""Respect"" is a disaster.......a true insult to the Aretha Franklin classic. Reba needs to stop trying to cover other people's tunes. This album marked the end of ""Reba"" as true country fans knew her and loved her. It was never the same after this."
5,In one word.....amazing,"If you are in a depressed, feel sorry for me now kind of mood then this one is for you. Most of the songs on this CD are slow and only 3 or 4 that have a more punk vibe to them. The absolute perfect CD to play for that first kiss, or after your girlfriend/boyfriend just ripped your heart out.Favorite song: Out of Reach"
5,overall : great cd,"anyone that gives this cd less than five stars should be kicked in the teeth.....Its soo cool, and they mix emo and alittle bit of punk even....great band , great cd, 4 minute mile kind of sucks though"
3,Tape it Off of a Friend first!,"This album is a total L-E-Tdown! The music is rhymthic and flowing (that's why I gave it a 3), but they need a new singer or he needs to revert back to his old yet BETTER ways of whining like a REAL emo-core singer does! Tape it off of a friend first and then buy it if you like it for some really strange reason!"
3,ok,"It's not a bad album. It has to many really mellow songs, however some are really upbeat. I guess this is just how an emo-punk album is supposed to be, but i'm not really into it. I liked the cd at first, but after a while it just gets depressing and boring"
1,I would give it zero stars if I could,"Kiddies, this is garbage. The Get Up Kids = Depressed Blink 182"
5,It couldn't get any better,I can't stop listening to this album. The two extra tracks not found on the american version are great. What else can I say. The only thing better than this is seeing them live.
5,easy listen'in.,"This C.D. is a very good one. Irecomend it to everyone that I meet. I say, ""hey, my name is T-Money you should buy The Get Up Kids cd Something to Write Home About"". It reach my high standard for the cd's I buy. So if you don't have it go get it. peace,love and T-Money"
4,OH MAN SUCH A GOOD CD,"i must say i was a little skeptical about tguk when i heard on a wire, but this cd is definately so much better, very emo music but SO SO good. standouts would have to be ""valentine"", ""red letter day"", and ""i'll catch you"" (oh man such a cute song)... pick up this cool cd, give it a few spins, i promise you, you'll never take it out."
5,I LOVE THIS CD!,Oh my gosh I love this cd! My friend got me hook on it when I went to visit her and Like I totally love this CD! I recommend everyone should get this CD! Every song on it is really good!
1,what happenned,"the get up kids have completely changed, and not for the better. can matthew pryor whine anymore, all you new sellout trendy emo fans go out and buy this album, think it is the greatest thing ever, and then go back and listen to your limp bizkit. A must buy for any trendy emo lover."
1,Who told these guys emo-pop was cool?,"This is by far the most disapointing album ive ever heared...the get up kids used to be one of my favorite bands..however...this has since changed...this album is pure sellout emo-pop...they sold there souls for a tour bus...another point...my girlfriends cd collections consists of: all the backstreet boys albums, nsync, savage garden....and this cd....WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?"
1,This album doesn't suck,"I haven't been this excited about an album in a while. This one is worth buying right now, instead of waiting for it to show up in the used bins. I just gave it one star so you'd read this (I know I only read the bad reviews). Its definately a 5 star album.Also, I just saw their show in SF, and it was amazing."
3,Its ok,"The Get Up Kids are great band who deserve alot of credit, just not for this album so much. Though the guitars and the drums change on every song it sounds like the vocals are all the same. Talking about breaking up and how hard it is. This is a good emo album but could use more topics of disscusion. I know your heart is broken because someone left you, but we are spending are money, or our time downloading you, so we want to hear something diffrent. Some of the lines are heart felt the first time and second, but when I hear them the 84 time over I begin to become board. Emo is a hard place to be because your songs are suppost to be emotional but you have to be careful not to bog them down. This isnt a record I suggest you play if you are sad, and not if your extremely happy because it will make you sad. It's an ok album but if they want to step up to the true emo like TAKING BACK SUNDAY, or SOMETHING CORPORATE, they need to stop wining and just play some good music."
1,definitely something to write home about,"this actually deserves 5 stars, just 1 star was given so it'll stand out from the rest of the 5's... if you really like Weezer, RiverFenix, J.E.W., and the Ataris combined, then this is the result."
5,Same Riff?,"Same riff? That's BS, I play guitar, and if you listen at all, the songs are completely different, it's just a cop out to say, ""Oh it's all the same."" It's one of the best CD's I've ever heard, enough said."
3,the get up kids,"do yourselves a favor and go buy four minute mile if you have not done so already, Four minute mile is without a doubt a much better album, and if you like it then buy something to write home about. This cd fails in comparison to the other."
5,"whoa, what's wrong with you people?","alright, what the hell? just go from song 3, to 4, to 5 and you'll hear such a difference. Am i hearing impaired? Or does Red Letter Day sound ABSOLUTELY NOTHING like Out Of Reach (best song). This album is definitely awesome. If anything, Four Minute Mile had songs that sounded the same. Anyway, buy it. its good."
5,I should be using this space to tell you how great this is..,"but, I feel I must comment on something more important. And that is, yes, I am a sellout. This is the first ""emo"" album I've ever bought. And yes, I bought it at a MAJOR CHAIN record store! Yes, I am a fan of Limp Bizkit and KoRn. And most importantly, yes, I LOVE THIS ALBUM! Now, I know what you maladjusted, ready-to-turn-on-your-band- as-soon-as-some- ""trendy"" -kid-likes-them morons will say: This isn't half as good as (insert early to mid '90s release here). You'll say that they've changed. I'll agree, because that's what a band is supposed to do. Evolve, stay fresh, and most of all not get boring. And the Get Up Kids are far from boring. Sure, it's not innovative musically, and yes, it's unbelievably catchy. So what? It's still a rockin' album, and that is all that needs to be said. If you like music, you'll like this album. If you like complaining, you'll complain about this album. But if you're smart, you'll give it a listen."
4,"Difficult to classify, easy to listen to.","The Get Up Kids have put out another album that will satisfy long time fans, as well as attract new fans of any rock genre there is. Is their music difficult to put an exact classification on? Yes. But doese that make it hard to listen to in any way? No. The Kids' overall sound bounces around and covers all different kinds of rock throughout, as the CD carries no repetitiveness. They will play some driving Pop-Punk w/some keyboards, heartfelt Emo, and some mellow soft/acoustic songs as well. I must warn you though, if you buy this CD thinking it is going to be a complete Emo or complete Pop-Punk CD, you could be dissapointed. But if you go into it just expecting some quality rock music, fans of both Emo and Pop-Punk will enjoy the album. Stand out tracks are, Action+Action Valentine, Holidays, Red Letter Day, 10 Minutes, and Long Goodnight."
4,Definately worth the money,"This CD is a very very fine CD, it appeals to most. When I first heard this CD I thought that it was garbage, but about a year later I rediscovered The Get Up Kids and realized that their music was actually good. Now this is true emo, there is much confusion about emo being alkaline trio, finch,etc. all that is not, THIS IS EMO. But you really dont even have to be an emo fan to enjoy this. most music fans will. So no matter what your into just look around and give these guys a chance."
3,Whoops!,"I actually wish I didn't buy this LP. I'd heard of them from ""Punxploitation"" with ""Action And Action"" and thought they sounded not half bad. Then ""Kerrang"" put them in the top 50 punk albums, so I thought ""why not?"" Now I know. It's not punk. It's pop gone semi-acoustic. What a pain in my wallet!"
4,My first dive into the Get Up Kids,"this is my first experience with the Get Up Kids. I must say, i'm very impressed. haven't heard any of their older stuff... yet, but from what i've heard... i like. I heard they were EMO, but this album isn't really very EMO, with the exception of maybe ""valentine"", and ""Out of Touch"". I do have a few complaints though.... some of the songs are a little too mainstream california 90s punk for me. Any song that begins with the words ""ten minutes to downtown"" is treading on thin ice with me-Way too corney. However, The Get Up Kids more then makeup for this with a solid 75% of an album. A cross between Weezer, and Sunny Day Real Estate. Bottom line-a great purchase for me, and probably you too."
1,"Wow, it was a big let down...","I used to love the get up kids. I am pretty disappointed when I heard this cd. The quality of the recording is sub-standard. The songs are just OK. Some are good, but NONE are great. Their frist Ep, first CD and the 2nd EP are much better. They have become the emo goo goo dolls."
2,getting there....,"The Get Up Kids continue to write ""gut-wrenching"" songs about becoming famous, being fresh faced kids on the road away from their loving girlfriends, and whatever else it is that is their limited point of reference. It's undeniably hooky and has some good rock moments, but once you get past it, you realize that they're not saying a damn thing. Add in the STALE keyboards and what you've got isn't the freshest or best tasting thing on the shelf. They should be paying Jimmy Eat World royalties, except Jimmy Eat World does it right and writes songs with maturity. If mushy love songs with no spine written from a 12 year old perspective sounds good, go for this. If you want maturity, purchase something by Jimmy Eat World."
2,BBBBBBBBBoring,"This album is a real waste of money. There is about Two or three good songs, but all the rest are bland and samey. It might be worth copying it from a mate, just because the first song on the album is one of the best songs I have heard for ages. But unfortunately it is the only shining light on a disappointing album"
3,A mediocre substitute for Cornwell's Sharpe series,"Being a great fan of Bernard Cornwell's Richard Sharpe series, it was with great enthusiasm that I started with Howard's stories of Alain Lausard, a French Dragoon. Alas, while interesting, the novels just are not as good as Cornwell's. The main character, a nobleman disguised as a commoner (the opposite of Cornwell's Richard Sharpe)is difficult to identify with. Of the four novels there is less action in this one than the others. The Battle of Austerlitz forms the background of the story with most of the combat taking place in the last 3rd of the story. All of his companions from the 1st novel are amazingly still with him. A passable read till the next Sharpe novel arrives."
2,Formulaic war fiction with little originality.,"Having just finished reading my second Richard Howard novel(Bonaparte's Sons), I was once again struck by the authors sheer audacity in transposing whole scenes from Willi Heinrich's Cross of Iron. I can also identify shades of Sven Hassel, in so much as the narrative largely focuses on a cavalry unit made up of convicted criminals. All in all, a poor attempt to cash in on this ever popular genre."
4,Very Cool Merchandise....,"As good as expected, just a bit of more inforamtion regarding the material would have given you the 5 stars."
3,Puma Esito-not too bad,"I use these shoes for my school and they work out fine, my only problems with them are that the synthetic material that the upper is made out of doesn't give me a good touch and feel on the ball and my shots are not as good as with my v Konstrukts (great shoe if you can afford it). There is good heel protection in the back and the shiny parts on the upper seem to hep out your touch a fraction. Overall a good shoe for training but not really for match play."
2,hard to see,"Nice looking watch, good price, but it's hard to see gold hands on a gold dial, too inexpensive to return, will go in the junk drawer."
4,chemical magic,"I am a professional magician working on an elementary school assembly program. I needed a way to have liquids change colors. This book had exactly what I needed. It also had a lot of other chemical effects that could certainly be used by science teachers covering a wide range of chemical topics. It is easily understood, and even gives ideas for the presentation.good book"
3,no much to say,"Typical book but the bad thing is that many chemicals (at least in Mexico) are hard to find, unless you have a permit from the Army due some chemicals are used on explosives.Also, very thin book."
2,Proceed with Caution,"This book gives lots of chemical demonstration ideas. However, some are entirely too dangerous to do. You must use a lot of common sense when considering doing any of these demonstrations. Some are not safe at all. Mercury and CCl4 are EPA regulated. It's not advisable to put ethanol in your mouth to spit out in front of students... This only demonstrates bad lab techniques. Make sure you do the first experiment in the book outside or in a fume hood. It releases a strong odor and an acid vapor. Definitely not something you want your students breathing!"
4,A fascinating book of (almost) homebrew chemistry!,"Ford's ""Chemical Magic"" is a book which harkens from a past era when chemicals probably were more easily obtained than today. The reading is quick and fascinating, and his summaries of why things work are very nicely done.The result of passing time is that some of the materials used in some experiments may be difficult or even impossible to procure. However, you shouldn't allow this to dissuade you from getting this book - the experiments you <u>can</u> perform will provide you quite a lot of enjoyment.Caution, however, is in order: Some of the reagents used are corrosive, poisonous, or even explosive. I'd advise ensuring that an adult is present to supervise if you care to attempt those particular experiments!"
5,Excellent for science teachers,"The activities in this book are not intended for home use; however, they work great as class demonstrations and/or student activities. There are a lot of excellent attention-grabbing results which, if not utilized as part of a core curriculum, certainly provide a memorable ""hook"" that can be used to teach essential National Science Education Standards topics."
5,Excellent,Highly recommendedMost of the experiments are possible in the backyard with spectacular results - challenge is to get the basic ingredients which were more easily accessible in pre 9/11 times
5,Excellent,"This DVD is amazing! I was in the arena watching the songs and the talks live back in 2006, and although nothing could come close to being back there in Nashville again, this is the next best thing. The shots and the quality of the actual DVD are excellent.If you're not familiar with the Passion movement, I should also say that the talks are definately worth the cost of buying this DVD. Moore, Giglio, and Piper are amazing teachers who stay close to the Word and Breath of God. This is life-changing stuff."
5,Excellent,I'm a pastor and a couple of months ago I ordered several worship videos to play before and after services. This is the hands down the best worship DVD I've seen! I was hoping Passion had another one out.
5,not so scary,"I bought my first Oil's album (Diesel and Dust) when I was 16 and terribly naive. I was almost too scared to buy it after seeing the cover for Head Injuries. Ten years later I own all of their albums, and Head Injuries is one of my favorites. Peter Garrett's vocals are filled with a sense of urgency (note the scream in Stand In Line), and the classic sound the Oils produce on this album truly ""rocks"". I also appreciate the spiritual tone to the lyrics. (I'm glad I went ahead and bought it!)"
2,It read like a doctoral thesis on polygamy...,"I was expecting to be ""inspired"" by the story of courageous pioneer women who lived this principle, but I found it to be devoid of a feeling of any kind. I admit I only read about 200 pages because it was like reading a technical paper. Ick."
5,Cookie Monster,"This is a great cookie book and I should know because I am a ""cookie monster"" and love cookie cookbooks! Wide variety, beautifully presented. Like all Reader's Digest books, this is a good quality book - well done in every respect. It is a large book but not ""hulking"" as the editorial reviewer said; it's just one of the large-size cookbooks of which there are many. This one is not freakish or anything, just large because there are so many great recipes. Terrific photographs and instructions.Easy to read. Some reviewers of its counterpart,Cakes, said the print was too small to read but that is NOT true at all. Both of these books are VERY easy to read - unless you require extremely Large Print books or something. These are just normal size print. A great buy for cookbook or cookie lovers!"
5,Fantastic Collection of Recipes,"Great collection of recipes. Didn't even know Reader's Digest had published this. Consider it a fantastic find for me and my personal collection. The recipes are great as reference material and they are sorted according to type (meringues and macaroons, sugar, chocolate, etc.). Haven't had a chance to try more than 2 or 3 of them yet but, all I've tried have turned out well. Reading and scanning the book's contents has also introduced me to some recipes from other countries that I had heard of and had been dying to try out."
4,Cookies....who knew!?,"I have spent a lot of time at home lately after an injury that occurred while I was mopping my place of business, Uncle Joey's Mashed Potato Bar.I needed a hobby that I could do around the house while I recovered. I decided that baking would be my new hobby, and cookies would be what I would specialize in. With the holidays coming up, how could I resist?Well, this book is wonderful, it taught me how to make all the holiday cookies that my mother and grandmother used to make.Do I miss working at my place of business? Yes...Will I return when I recover? Maybe not. I just might become a professional cookie maker after reading this. WATCH OUT MRS. FIELDS! Musicalgenius Jeremy's Cookie Hut might be the new hotspot in the food court!And when my new cookie business takes off, then I can finally take over the world."
2,The Dark on the Other Side,"While I much admire Ms. Michaels writing, I really don't think that this is one of her best. It seemed rather messy and unresolved. The ending was just not really up to her usual mind-boggling style. All in all though, it was an entertaining read for a gloomy afternoon."
3,Not her best,"I am a big fan of this author, but probably would not have been if this story was the first of hers I had read. Usually, I devour her stories and find them difficult to put them down. This one was okay, but more wordy than she usually is; especially, within the first half of the book. Also, the story was a little less believable than her others. I agree with the previous reviewer in that the reader is to decide what was really happening and even after finishing, the reader determines what they want to believe. But I do not agree that this is Ms. Michaels best."
2,AHHHHHH. Not you Mrs. Michaels!,"I am a huge Barbara Michaels fan, yet when I read this book I was higly disappointed.The characters are tranparent and the story line was completely tiresome. I have read mostly all of her novels and I can honstly say this is the worst one she has ever read. If you want to see Barabara Michaels at her peak read SONS OF THE WOLF, VANISH WITH THE ROSE, or STITCHES IN TIME. They will give you insight into the genius of Mrs.Michael's, not this book."
2,Bored all the way though,I have loved each and every book by Barbara Michaels and could not wait to get into this one. I am very sad to say it was not at all up to the degree of writing I have come to love in Barbara Michaels books. It really was a difficult read. It was slow and I struggled to continue reading it hoping it would get better. It didn't get better.
2,AHHHHHH. Not you Mrs. Michaels!,"I am a huge Barbara Michaels fan, yet when I read this book I was higly disappointed.The characters are tranparent and the story line was completely tiresome.

1,User. Experience,This product did not work for me and also gave me a minor stomach ache. I stopped taking it after almost finishing the first bottle.
4,Dose Info,"I've taken Quercetin from various brands for about two years. My problem was occasional outbreaks of hives, rather than seasonal allergies, but I do think it has helped. I've noticed that mosquito bites now disappear in the same night or next morning, rather than lasting two or three days. Anyway, I thought others might want to know the nutritional info on the bottle.In my 200 Tablet bottle, 1 serving is 1 gram Quercetin per 3 tablets, so 333 mg per 1 tablet.3 tablets also contain:vitamin C 646 mgmagnesium 50 mgbromelain 300 mgquercetin 1 gramSome other reviews have indicated that you can't take too much of this supplement. However, I've read about side effects and drug interactions with bromelain, so it's a good idea to read up on those before taking bromelain."
5,Basketball rim,The item was exactly what we ordered. The description was perfect and exactly what my son wanted.
1,a disappointment: -5,"Probably not a good choice for me: this was my first vibe purchase. The vibrations were too weak even turned on to max. The vibration speed control wouldn't stay moblie and kept shifting on/off. This product hurts if you insert deeply and try to thrust. I actually got it stuck. I don't think a woman designed this product because the little bottom ""wave"" doesn't fit. I definitely will not order on-line again. I think seeing the product up close is a better idea. The price is cheap but you get what you pay for."
1,Seriously?,I would have to say this product was probably an awesome item for women who need a large instrument. This barely made it inside my girlfriend and almost didn't make it back out. Avoid it if you are built small down there.
2,Yikes!,"Double yikes; this thing is huge! I couldn't even get it near me, and the vibrations aren't really that strong. 2 stars because it's pink and soft, but I won't be using it again!"
5,BEST KEPT SECRET IN MEN'S COLOGNE SSHH.....,"After using Armani Mania for years, a friend gave me a sample and I had to have a bottle. Although Armani is still a favorite, this cologne is the best. Unique scent that does not overpower, but is long-lasting.You will not find this in stores. Amazon always has a place, and the price is great (about 1/2 of cost of Armani). Shape of the bottle is unlike any other cologne, which makes this an unforgettable product.Chicks love this stuff!"
4,short story saga,The hype for his most recent Tenth of December release prompted me to visit CivilWarLand. While some stories are poignant and revealing others just sit there. This volume is far less developed and mature and far less satisfying than Tenth of December. It does provide a guide to later development and the surreal environment that Saunders often likes to play in. Reviewing this work provides a clearer picture of the author's place in the firmament.
3,Overrated by NY Times,"Bought this for my Kindle solely on the NY Times book review as well as recommendations on the Morning Joe show on MSNBC. Wish I'd previewed it before clicking 'buy', Yes, the writing is good but the unrelenting negative tone of the stories made me stop reading them. Won't finish this book."
3,Up and Down,"Decided to read George Saunders first book after reading the recent bio of him in the NY Times. Some interesting stuff here, but certainly not as earth shattering as people make his work out to be."
2,Magazine Fiction,"Saunders is a writer that is working on a single theme, with singular energy. This is not a problem for a writer if he brings something fresh to the theme each time he tackles it. Saunders will sometimes do this, but more often than not, he fails. That is why some of the stories in this collection are brilliant, while others seem like derivatives of those moments of brilliance. Rather than bring us a fresh insight on the problems of fiction, Saunders seems content to simply reiterate. Saunders is the archetypical writer of magazine fiction: in between the slick covers of The New Yorker his work is a bold standout, but when you set his stories alongside each other in a volume, the record skips."
5,A great book to turn friends on to...,"This is a fantastic look at a future America that is not quite a nightmare yet; however it is a fevered night-sweat full of tossing and turning on sticky polyester blankets.George Saunders has created a world solely his own, where everything is a scam and the hucksters are everywhere; from the wave-pool to the museums to the theme parks. Everything is for sale and the price is reasonable. Just don't look too closely or you'll notice that the merry facades hide some sinister secrets.This is one of my favorite books of the last several years and is at the top of my recommended reading list; but beware, this is the type of book that people tend to forget to return. I'd suggest purchasing several copies and, with the holidays approaching, give them as gifts. Trust me, it'll be appreciated. Ray Schmitz III"
4,Theme parks of the damned,"Saunders takes the misfits of society and places them in nightmare worlds of corporate double-speak, psychobabble and unthinkable tragedy. All the ills of our society become magnified in his visions, particularly in his novella, set in a United States where disease, pollution, prejudice and greed have done the work we thought the H-bomb would do. In most of these stories, the heros find some kind of redemption, even if it's the redemption to be found in death and the afterlife. A strangely Calvinistic look a the world. I couldn't put it down"
5,Must read,"Gives a voice to the world you might assume is on the fringe of society until you realize it is society. Every sentence worth reading, some will burrow in your head for a long time to come."
4,The meek shall not inherit the earth,"The title story is the gem here, about a ""passive flake"" who works at an historical theme park. Saunders isn't a complex writer, but he has a wonderfully ironic, almost deadpan, style. These aren't exactly uplifitng stories, and clearly go against the grain of our current American optimism.If I have a criticism, it's that a few of the stories seem redundant. I would like to see more by Saunders, but only if he has something more to say. It's hard to imagine he could express his world-view any better than he's done already."
3,Mixed bag of tricks,"An interesting debut collection. Most striking is Saunders's style - concise, terse, with wry humour and cleverly weighted comic dialogue. Some of these stories, especially the Novella, Bounty, tend to sag a little and come across as a little cliche hysterical realism, but there are also sections of fine comedy. Best of all, I reckon, is 'The 400 pound CEO' about an obese office gimp who ekes out a tragic existence in a nightmarish corporate scenario with a sadistic boss.Saunders has something of a cult reputation. He deserves a larger audience."
2,What drugs was this guy on?,The stories were boring and terse. I think he was hitting the ... and making the ... up as he went along. The 400lb CEO was supposed to be the best story in the bunch and it was weak. I did not finish this book.
3,To hard to find good information.,I was interested in the meditation and techniques used in Tummo. After reading the first couple of chapters I was left with a lot of Buddhist ideas but not sure how to still progress. I would recommend Becoming the Iceman if you want to lean Tummo.
2,a book that cannot stand on its own,"I do not like it when the book you are reading tells you ""I will not go into this because I have explained it elsewhere."" It seems impossible to get a good understanding of tummo (the inner fire) without reading Lama Yeshe's other books. The reader is redirected to other places to learn about the most essential information like specific mantras to complete the practices mentioned. We have lots of philosophical ""good stuff"" in this book, but when it comes to practice, oops! you need a flesh and blood guru, or better, another book by the same publications."
4,Shortcut to Bliss,"This book is thought-provoking; yet, it's very aim is to move beyond thought.I'm trying the techniques gently with mixed success. It appears they work best for me after yoga when the body and mind are naturally more in tune.It is not well-written - but it is very well intended. The translation is not perfect - but the book is quite understandable in terms of the suggested practices.If you prefer chakra energy exercises, this might provide useful insight for you. Don't expect miracles, it takes practice!The fruits of the practice arrive when you least expect them. I think it opens you up to awareness of bliss and you more readily accept it into your life. Like the Christian notion of grace, you can't create it - you can only prepare to accept it! May bliss find you!"
4,Great book,"Ive have just read through this book and i think that it is really good. i teaches u techniques that helps u when practicing tummo. and at the same time,it also teaches u on becoming a better person."
4,Matt Munisteri is a Fun Cat,The eclecticism of Matt Munisteri never ceases to amaze me. He is a guitarist who often thinks outside of the box.
4,Worth the look - full of great detailed information,"This slender book is very deceiving and I was a bit disapppointed when it first arrived. But after I got into the details, I was very pleased. This book has a wealth of information to help you plan your trip to the Grand Canyon area, with information on everything from climate to lodging to side trips to canyon excursions. This book helped us choose a wonderful-looking cabin right on the rim of the canyon and I am looking very much forward to our trip this fall."
5,Husband loves it.,I bought my husband a Dremel for Christmas and after reading the reviews on several websites opted to buy him this attachment. He loves it and immediately knew what it do with this piece. In my world buying awesome power tools for my hubby makes me sexier lol.
4,No issues-did what I needed it to do,"Quality is good, works as intended, Condition and workmanship as advertised. No surprises good or bad, so no issues with this product."
5,Dremel 575 Right Angle Attachment for Rotary Tool,Great product exactly as described Very Fast shipping from supplier. Dremel sets the standard for precise tools. Recommend this product to anyone wanting high quality tools Thank You Amazon..
5,easeir cabinet and drawer repair access.,"I purchased this product as an added precaution, since we have some cabinets at home, that get heavy use, the way the bolts were originally installed require some tinkering and maneuvering to be able to reach, so they unfortunately stay loser then what we would like, this attachment game me good access to the bolts and i was able to do repairs much easier."
5,Where have you been,This should prove to be a first class item. When working in cramped areas this is better then the Flex Shaft since you can get the whole tool in where you need it. Plus the quick installation is so useful.
4,Handy for small spaces,"I bought this unit to get into a small space in the rear of my engine compartment and it fit the bill. I was drilling out some broken bolts in an exhaust manifold. Using the diamond point tool and the tungsten carbide bit I was able to dimple the bolt enough to use a right angle Ryobi cordless to do the real drilling. Be careful using real drills as the speed is excessive to drill in steel. Cutting using drills in steel requires much slower speeds, and while the Dremel can go slower, it does not develop enough torque at those settings. Be sure to use the collar lock in the attachment and not the spindle lock in the Dremel tool itself or it will break the internal shaft.I also used it for cutting off the stub of the bolt, and found the right angle attachment allowed me into spaces that the tool would not go otherwise.All-in-all a good Dremel attachment but with the same limitations of the basic tool. Use for smaller jobs."
4,Great tool for tight spaces,Great tool for getting into tight spaces. I needed to drillholes for shelf-support pins in a very narrow kitchencabinet and this worked out well. Keep in mind that thisis not (nor is it meant to be) a heavy-duty power tool.It seems to be reasonably well made and the price isright. An excellent addition to most any Dremel tool kit.
4,Should have bought this 5 years ago,"Makes the dremel tool fit in much tighter spaces. I just leave this on the dremel, I don't see a reason to ever take it off. Only thing is you can't use the shaft lock on the dremel tool anymore to tighten the mandrel in the chuck or you risk harming the 90 attachment. They should have provided a shaft lock on the 90 attachment but instead they say jam a 1/8"" mandrel in a hole on the attachment."
4,Dremel right angle attachment easier on the wrist.,"I bought this to covert my Dremel into a mini angle grinder for sanding small areas on the carousel ponies we are making. Dremel doesn't sell small hook and loop sanding discs, so I made my own out of thick leather and velcro. Sanding in this manner with the Dremel alone was awkward, and this attachment made all the difference. It creates a bit of gear noise though, making me wonder how much added stress it is putting on the machine, and how long the mechanism is going to last. That's why I gave it only 4 stars. It seems to be solidly built of metal gears and bearings and is easy to attach and remove. Overall I am quite happy with it."
3,Hunting Stories,The book was not what I expected. It arrived in good condition and in a timely manner. I wanted it for a young hunter and I don't feel it served it's purpose
4,Great gift,Bought this book as a Christmas gift for my husband. He has yet to open it (it's only December 7) but I'm sure that he will like it. It's a great book for the hunter in your life.
5,Excellent Carver,I have owned several Chicago Cutlery items for years and wanted to add to my set. This is an excellent carving knife and the wooden handle gives it classy look. I would recommend this knife to everyone.
5,GREAT carving knife,I broke my old Chicago Cutlery carving knife (my fault - hammer hit) and figured I blew $30 - $50. I was amazed the replacement was so inexpensive and it arrived very quickly. I love their knives and can only find them online.
5,Carver Knife,Just tried this knife on a port roast the other nith and it cuts and slices really well and it is American made--bonus! Reasonably priced too.
2,Didn't love it,"Not as dreamy a photo as I wanted it to be, the contrast is a little harsh, it's just okay. If I find another one I like better I will replace it."
4,"If You Don't Enjoy This Music, I'll Double Your Popcorn Back","In his short life, Bellini was a major innovator. He was the ONLY composer that Richard Wagner praised whole-heartedly (and deliberately imitated in his ""long melodies""). The plot of IL PIRATA is about as stupid as any in all of opera, but its music is out of this world. Here and there, one hears passages that remind us that this is the person who composed the far better-plotted and, rightly, more famous opera NORMA. Forget about IL PIRATA's plot and immerse yourself in this amazing man's music."
5,ionic brush,"I have gone through two battery powered sonicare toothbrushes this deployment. This one is simpler, and hopefully more durable. I had one years ago and it worked fine. The newer version has refinements, to include a battery power indicator and improved brush head."
1,not the best choice,"I am a practicing dental hygienist ( for the past 9 years ). One of my patients asked my oppinion on ionic toothbrush, so i decided to try it. I red all reviews, it sounded good enough, so i purchased it. It sucks. What a waist of $25. It doesn't do anything. Even a manual toothbrush does a better job. If you want great results, use Oral-B or Sonicare. Yes it is more money, but so worth it."
1,Save your money and buy a Sonicare Flex,I did try to believe that by just placing my wet finger over the little metal plate on the brush handle magic ions would clean my teeth and make them all better. I really did try. Finally though the silliness of it all just got to me and I got a Sonicare. Now I don't have to pretend and it is doing wonders for my teeth and gums. Seriously. If I could give it 0 stars I would.
4,Makes mouths happy!,"I feel extra clean now. My tongue, my teeth, my gums -- this toothbrush has amazingly soft bristles that work extremely well. I don't understand ""ionic"" stuff that well, but this things leaves my mouth all fresh!"
1,Dream Hunter,I enjoyed this book though not as much as the Dark-Hunter series of novels. I love the other worldliness of the stories in both series and the way they are the protectors of the human race. This novel is not the usual type of Hunter book but I would recommend this one and all Hunter books to my friends. I have read and reread all the Hunter series and will keep rereading them. Keepers for sure!
2,Very disapointed,"Like others have said, I use to love, love the dark hunters series but Kenyon is getting this story line way to complicated. This book doesn't have meat to it. The story begins when the hero is in love already but he's selfish, weak and pretty dumb. Kenyon then starts to tell you about how they got to where they are, so you have to back track through all of the past before you get anywhere.Also what is it about all of these characters and everyone having so much freaking power???I really hope for a good DH book again, please, let's just get back to what made us love you Kenyon!"
3,It's O-K,"Well I must say I agree with most folks here. I was wondering why I was struggling with this book and then I read the reviews. It wasnt just me. This book just felt thrown together to me, like she isnt quite sure where she wants to go with this storyline. The love scenes were not SK quality. There was no heat between Geary and Arik and it was hard to assume it was there. They werent tied together well to me. I found myself just trying to get through it.I love the DH series and this author. I am hoping she will pull it back together with Solin's story if it gets that far."
2,Extremely disappointed.,"Once again disappointed but I sorta knew that I would be. While reading this, I felt that Sherrilyn was too hung up on getting herself and the fans ready for Ash's book that she took a potential good story away from this story as well as the last one. She spent too much time on other characters as well as adding scenes that really has nothing to do with this particular story. It wasn't well written and if you actually remember the storyline of the other books, there's alot of stuff that does not add up. The transition was not smooth at all. Thank goodness this wasn't released in hardcover."
1,"Hey, the boat blew up. Let's go to dinner.",Ms. Kenyon owes me the time it took me to read this. The only minor positive things were the references to Greek Mythology - but I'm not sure they are correct. The sex encounters were fairly well done and one wonders where she gathered the material for those. The plot development was poor at best.I'm happy to have this behind me. It was a struggle to slog through it.
1,What did the readers do to deserve this?,"I had to skim this book after reading the prologue, which just sucked all the pleasure I had with my life out of my soul. The heroine is a typical nerd/hot girl with daddy issues who meets the unbelievably sexy but SUPER ""bad"" hero who isn't so bad after all. They go through exchanges of we can't be together but let's shag anyway, insane bouts of misunderstandings, and endless amounts of self torture and self pity.That's the whole book, I swear. I got this from just looking at a couple of pages and now I wonder where that hour went. And the only thing you have to do since the book doesn't let you think for yourself is to figure out which girl our homeboy Acheron, leader of the Dark-Hunters from Ms. Kenyon's other series, is going to end up with. Will it be the nerdy yet innocent Tory, or the beautiful yet childish Thia?Seriously, borrow this one from the library. The money you save can buy a better book."
1,At least it wasn't hardcover this time!,"Wow, what a disappointment. I was not really thrilled with the last Dark Hunter book, and was hoping this one would get back in the swing of things. So far I've had the book a week, and still have not been able to get through the whole thing. I'm almost done though, so maybe the last few pages will get better.I think SK has fallen into the pattern that a lot of series seem to fall into. After a few books, a major, tragic hero emerges from the secondary characters, and everyone wants to read his story. But once that book is done, the series is over, so the author stretches things out to keep us buying, dropping little hints of his story to tantalize the readers. Unfortunately, in the quest for Acheron's story, SK seems to have run out of good material in the meantime."
1,The Dream Hunter,I hated this book. I did read it and it took me a Whole month to get through it. Dumb. I usually read one of the Dark Hunter books in two days. This one not so. Hated it.
3,Just not that good,"I like Sherrilyn Kenyon books a lot. But I don't like this one and I wasn't thrilled about the last one. The Dream-Hunter as a novel just seems strained. No infant/breast fixation jokes, please -- where did that come from? Sherrilyn is often funny and clever, but the humor in this book was not funny and not clever, but just plain ol' juvenile.The interactions between several of the characters are too contrived to be interesting. Granted, this is fantasy, but you still need to believe in characters motives and behaviors and this just misses. Read it if you must, but you might be disappointed if you're looking for a really good read."
1,Not a Sherrilyn Kenyon winner,"Like most of the reviewers here I was less than impressed with this book. I had the book an entire month before I could bring myself to finish it. Not typical of me and a Sherrilyn Kenyon book! I normally finish them in one marathon sitting. If you have never read Kenyon, DON'T start with this book. Read any of the Dark-Hunter series and you will not be disappointed. Read this one and you will never read another Kenyon book, thus depriving yourself of some of the greatest reading experiences ever."
1,Buy It Used,"I can't give a complete review of the book because I didn't finish it. I normally love all her books, but they have been getting weaker. I got half way through this book and didn't have the desire to finish it. I skimmed until the end, only reading the parts with Ash. I'm hoping the stories improve, if not I may have to pass on the rest of the series until Ash's story finally comes out."
2,Not up to her usual.,I'm a big fan of the Dark Hunter series and I looked forward to this book. Unfortunately this book doesn't live up to her previous standards. It was boring and hard to get through which has never happened to me with this author before. I seems like the dream hunter idea hasn't been completely fleshed out yet and isn't quite ready for publication.
1,Waste of time!,"First book of Kenyon's that I've tried to read, and it will be the last. Forced myself to finish this book, hoping that there would be some salvageable romantic storyline to make up for the boring plot and poor writing. No such luck. Please read the majority of the 1-2 star reviews and don't waste your time or money on this."
1,Really really bad,"This book was so bad it was cringeworthy. I've brought all of her books even though the last few have been just bad. No more, this book was just too bad. A thick female and a hero I couldn't bring myself to care about."
1,I Am Waiting for Acheron's Story...,"...and that will be it. I do not know what happened with this series. I think back to characters like Julian of Macedon and Vane Kattalakis and their stories - stories that made me go out and purchase just about every word the author had published. Unfortunately, the stories and the characters (especially the recent spate of heroines) have been leaving me absolutely flat, so I will wait for Ash's story to end the saga for me."
4,Dream Hunter,"I liked this dream hunter book. It was interesting, not the most out of all of Kenyon's series but still enough happening here to capture my attention. Worth the read. :)"
1,Dream Hunter,"I have read MANY of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter books. The first few really captured my attention. Not so much with the Were Hunters and especially not this first Dream Hunter for me. I just cannot get into it at all. Boring boring, and definately not what I expect out of SK. Same story, different names. I say she should leave well enough alone and quit trying to just make money off of the series. I'll stick with the Black Dagger Brotherhood instead."
3,Didn't love it,I am just not a Dream-Hunter fan. I read them for the Dark-Hunter storyline but if it wasn't for Ash I would skip them all together.
3,Lost that Loving Feeling,"As a Huge SK fan, I was hoping that this book would regain my enthusiasm for her books but I was disappointed again. I don't know what is going on with SK. The last three books have just fell flat for me. It seems as though someone else has started writing for her and just can't seem to get it right. The characters in Dream Hunter were boring and lacked the depth that we as SK fans have come to expect. This book was just OK for me, nothing more. It took me five days to finish it when I usually read one of her books in a day, two at the most.I so desperatly miss characters like Zarek, Vane and Kyrian and if Kat is going to be Ash's heroine in a future book, she is going to need some serious character development because I just don't like her. She doesn't seem worthy of Ash.For anyone looking for some HOT, SEXY vampires, try J. R. Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood series. (And I do mean HOTTTT!!!) But be warned, the brothers are addictive."
3,Did not meet my expectations,"This book is not as good as I would expect from this author. I couldn't connect with the heroes and I felt no love between them. I really didn't like the time limit, and the way he went about winning her. She was so reluctant at first, but once she found out he only had two weeks as a human she suddenly decided she liked and wanted him. I had problems with the hero's initial bargain. OK, I know he wasn't supposed to feel, but to trade the heroine's life for two weeks as a human? I don't know... Then, the love just didn't develop. First it wasn't there, then it was there. What about falling in love?All in all, I wasn't very impressed with this latest effort by SK. But I'm still looking forward to reading more of her work."
3,To Each His/Her Own,"I enjoy Sherrilyn Kenyon but sometimes her story line zigs when it should zag. The Dream Warrior series I like because when they are referred to in the Dark Hunter series, I was curious to know what there stories were. They are entertainment. No one has to write a dissertation on why they don't like them because that could be the very reason someone else DOES like them and won't recommend them out of fear of sounding stupid. The only complaint I have is the same as one other reader. There is so much going on in her latest books that I start getting really tired and have to put the book down. She needs to keep her characters memorable."
2,Dream-Inducing (not a compliment),"This book didn't do it for me. I love Kenyon's Dark Hunter series as a whole, but this, the first book in the Dream Hunter series was boring. I didn't care for the hero and the heroine was annoying. The premise was truly intersting, but the execution just didn't work for me. Pity, really."
2,Extremely Disappointed,"I wait anxiously for each new book but, alas, this book was VERY disappointing and fell way short of her usual mark. I hope her next Dark Hunter book is back on track."
1,One of the worst I've read this year...,"This is one of the worst or the worst I've read this year. I read an average of 7 books a week and this one I couldn't even finish. Read about a third then went to the end. I wasn't even interested enough to look of the parts that had Ash in them. This was put immediately in the ""Get it to the used book store quick before they get so many they won't take it"" pile. It was RUBBISH. I'm so disappointed in the last few SK books that I won't be buying anymore."
2,Leave the Closet Closed,"I like Ms. Kenyon's work usually but you can tell this is one of her earlier novels that they pulled out of the closet and published. It may be its first time in print but that is because the sex is bad, the characters flat and the plot uninteresting. I liked a couple of the secondary charcters much more than the main ones. I think she like the secondary charcters more as well because she went on to publish some really good books. I wish this one had been one of them."
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of the Dark Hunter series and looked forward to this release. However, it was very dry, no spark. I only finished it because I enjoy the series. There are a few minor references to Acheron and the DH's (he says something - again - that sets Nick Gautier's death in motion). Hopefully this is an aberration, I enjoy Sherrilyn Kenyon's other work, it is innovative and compelling.FYI, this book is set in the 1990's, that's why there were references to Zarek, etc. that were resolved in previously published books. If you're going to do that in an established series it really should shed some light on the current mysteries. The only interesting thing about this book was the allusion to Kat's parentage (Ash's presumed love interest)."
1,As good as JR Ward.... Please,"This is my first Sherrilyn Kenyon book after previous postings equated her with JR Ward. I was excited to find a new author since it will be forever before the next BDB will be out. This will be my last Kenyon book. While I enjoyed the Greek elements, it was too confusing trying to separate the gods from the demi-god from the half-breeds from the Dark Hunters. It seemed like she was trying to fit too many story lines into one book, esp since I had no previous context. And the storyline overall was weak - characters, love story, etc. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing."
1,Not very dreamy...,"I'm disappointed. Sherrilyn Kenyon's books used to be great. I love the historical romance ones as well as the Lords of Avalon, but the Dark-Hunter novels have progressively deteriorated and now this Dream-Hunter novel, one that I was looking forward to, was not so great. It took me a LONG time to read it, when it usually takes me little time to read a book. I had to put it down when I grew frustrated that the story line was stagnant. Other parts I had to skip over just to get through it. What's going on with the novels? For the first book in the Dream-Hunter series, it wasn't very good. Didn't feel any love between the characters- one minute they were strangers and the next they were in love. Where was the progression?"
1,Dream Yawn,"I have really enjoyed Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter series, but Mother of Pearl, what's with these boring spin-offs? I had to yawn my way through pages of repetitive text making me feel as though I was on a circular read to nowhere. I laid it down, I picked it up, and finally finished it two weeks after purchase (I usually finish one of her books in an afternoon). I found the characters unappealing (Arik, the ""Dream-Hunter,"" was nothing more than a voyeur) and I fail to understand why SK's mythological deities always use American slang and colloquialisms. It's not as bothersome when her novels are set in the States, but in Greece and Atlantis? The Dream Hunter series was aptly named since it is guaranteed to put you to sleep."
3,Dream Hunters,I was really dissapointed in this book. I wanted them to get to Atlantis and have a look around. That was her dream after all. It is an ok book but I had a hard time talking myself into picking it up to finish it.
1,disappointing,"As an avid reader, I was interested in this book on the back cover synopsis. Reading 50 or so pages into this book, I hoped it would get better, but it crashed and burned. The plot was weak, the editing was horendous and the characters predictable. Don't spend your money, this book is a true waste of time."
3,Ok,I absolutely love the Dark Hunter series but this book was dry. The relationship between the story's main characters was poorly put together. I felt like I had to push myself to read it. I did enjoy the insight into Katra and how Kenyon did some back story into her idea of Atlantis. I love Tory and I hope Kenyon develops a good relationship between her and Acheron in his story. I suggest reading this book only for insight in further books but do not hope for a good read.
2,SO boring,This book was poorly written compared to the dark hunter books. The story line about dream hunters was silly and working in Acheron felt forced. It bothered me that I couldn't figure out how to pronounce the heroine's first name the entire book. I didn't believe she loved the dream god. Skip this.
2,"Hate to say it, but I was disappointed...","If this is the first book branching off in a new direction, I would say that I will not be reading that series. It actually hovered on the dull side, and I found myself skipping ahead to bypass certain parts. That's the kiss of death for a story. I will check out the next one to see if it has improved, but otherwise, I'll be sticking with the Dark Hunter series."
4,Hot Chocolate!,"Megeara's quest for Atlantis and fantasies of chocolate and Arik hooked me. Meg is realistic and lovingly drawn, while Arik is a walking fantasy making deals with the devil. Great action scenes with an occasional drag in the plot, you'll keep reading just to find out what happens with Atlantis and Arik."
1,This Dream is a Nightmare,"I have read most of Sherrilyn Kenyon's ""Dark Hunter"" books and have enjoyed them. This isn't ""Great Literature,"" but I have come to expect a good story and likable characters. The characters in ""The Dream Hunter"" are not likable, or even admirable on any level. The situations are cartoonish, and I felt the novel was written in a hurry, with no real thought behind it. I would give Miss Kenyon another chance, but only once."
2,Not a good representation,"I am so glad I am not the only one that thought this book was well below the usual standard for a Sherilyn Kenyon book. I almost put it down. My reading time is valuable and I hate to waste it. When I realized that was how I felt I was almost sick with it because I love the Dark Hunter series.To read the dark hunter series you really have to believe in the characters to buy into the plot and imagine their world...the two main characters in this book are never, not in one scene together, believable.The only thing that brings this book up to two stars is the banter between Arik and Solin as well as the scene between Hades and Persophene. I continued to the end believing the whole time that there would be some payoff that would make it worth struggling through. There wasn't. Well, maybe I care a little bit about Solin now, but I don't know if I would buy a book about his story without seeing reviews first."
3,Verdict is still out on Dream-Hunters,"I love Kenyon's Dark-Hunters and shape-shifters but I'm not completely sold on the Dream-Hunters idea. While Akris was all yummy scumptiousness, I couldn't get into the whole living through people's dreams vibe. Also, Megeara wasn't particularly relatable as a heroine. The depth of feeling seemed lacking. Eeh, we'll see..."
1,Embarrassing,"Sherrilyn Kenyon is a new author to me, and, as with all new authors, i took a risk in purchasing this book. This book was not a winner. everything seemed so, so, predictable, even the romance. The whole story is based on Arikos, a demi-god cursed by Zeus to feel no emotions, who makes a selfish decision to trade one women's life for two brief weeks of pleasure. early on in his alloted time, he, predictably, falls for the woman whose soul is promised in the bargain, and realizes his mistake. the book seems amateur in that none of the characters seem real. The humans are constantly shifting on their deepest held beliefs/quests/morals, and the gods seem shallow and cant settle on a distinct speech pattern (ancient and powerful god, Whiny 21st century teen) .I couldn't decide if the characters were supposed to be comical, or were just poorly written. The plot seemed as if it was there to provide a background for the unrealistic sex. This book was a waste of a good ten bucks."
4,First time reading Kenyon,"I thought this book was pretty good. I have only read a short story of the dark-hunters, so the order this book falls didn't bother me. I am waiting for my shipment of dark-hunter books and after reading the reviews of this book, I am glad I read this one first. There were a lot of characters in this book, however, I think it lent to the story more. Have you ever been reading a book and wonder where everyone was? This book was rich with detail and I read it in less than two days. I loved the unique spin on greek mythology. This book flowed with what made me turn to Sherrilyn Kenyon in the first place."
1,Is this Serious?,"Or a joke? They murdered, the songs, horrible, don't waste your money on this CD!!! I don't need a 1000 words to say it's awful!They should be embrassed, this CD was even made!"
5,"Finally, a band worthy of 5 stars","Yes, finally a band worthy of 5 stars comes along.The Secret Machines' are simply awesome. It is true that they are better live, but their CD is just as amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone who like 70's-ish krautrock or progrock. Brandon's voice is beautiful, Ben plays a wonderful guitar, and Josh on the drums...wow."
4,"Buy this album, then go see them live!","This band is a small army of 3, and they deliver the real shock and awe. The album is loaded with great hooks, plenty of atmosphere, and terrific musicianship. It's not all thunder though, with a number of moody mid-tempo tracks balancing the record out very well. Live, they will nail you to the nearest wall, and you will love it! Forget all the inevitable comparisons with other groups and listen up.... these guys have their own sound, their own vision, and I'm predicting they are going to be great.Full length debut albums seldom are as impressive as ""Now Here is Nowhere"""
5,This is the Good Stuff,"I stumbled into this band from an indie website. I wasn't looking to be blown away by anything there; just looking for interesting new stuff. And then I heard Secret Machines. The hair stood up on the back of my neck. My throat tightened, and my saliva got thick. OMG, I thought. Can it be? Have I really stumbled onto a band this good? The answer is, YES. It's not often that I get the opportunity to be totally blown away by a chance listen, but this is it.Do yourself a HUGE favor: Buy this album and turn all your friends on to it. You'll never regret it. Five HUGE stars. Wow.(I don't normally gush like this. Sorry. But these guys are the best thing I've heard in a long time...)"
4,Excellent Psychadelia,"saw these guys open for the yeah yeah yeahs in providence, and i immediately downloaded their album from their website. good stuff..."
1,Not Good,Was looking forward to hearing this on the back of their impressive EP & the globs of press they are garnering right now. To say this album is a disappointment is an understatement. This album goes absolutely nowhere from start to finish. It is just flat out boring & the same riff/bass line/melody are used on three of the same songs. They attempt to ape The Flaming Lips & Interpol but it all ends up sounding forced and just plain amateurish.
4,One of the best releases of 2004 & 2005,"This reminds me of Flaming Lips ""Hit to Death in the Future Head"". It's sonic, rockin, catchy, trippy, and flows together nicely."
3,Great sound,"Maybe it deserves more than the 3 stars that i give them 'cause i've heard the album 2 times and for a definitive point of vue i need to hear albums 3 times...i can wait to see those 3 Englishmen comin' in the center of Europe...I've heard somewhere that somebody compares them to the Pink Floyd ...i don't see any connection with the floyd. They music can be called progressive rock but this is not a reason to compare them to other progressive band. Kula Shaker ,Beta Band, or the Kingsbury Manx are influenced by the Floyd but not Secret Machines...oh it's time to leave the cybercafé is closin'...i reccommend to people who love this album something a little different, another British band called Kasabian ...their even cult in UK now only one month after the release of their first album who became number 4 in the UK charts! Townshend and Daltrey (the who), the Gallaghers(oasis) , Mani(primal scream,stone roses)etc... are real fan of this band!bye"
1,Utter Crap,"About 2 months ago, myself & at least 2 other individuals rated this piece of crap 1 star & then all of a sudden our postings were deleted! So once again, do not waste your time with this snooze fest of an album. Their attempt to ape Interpol & The Flaming Lips is downright comical. Of the nine or so ""songs"" on this album, three of them have the exact bassline/beat/melody...did these guys just run out of ideas? Utterly disappointing, especially since their EP had some promise."
1,Don't believe the amazon hype,"I think the bands' immediate family must be writing reviews listed on Amazon. I intended to purchase the latest Modest Mouse CD (a great album and a great band) and got sucked into buying this CD based on an Amazon recommendation. What a mistake. Horrible, derivative, uninspired crap. Really. My big mistake was not listening to the samples available on Amazon. Take if from me--if you listen to a sample--any sample, you will not buy this album. Not going to waste any more time on this mediocre album--just hoping this prevents others from making the same $10 mistake I made."
3,"It,s Cool","I'm goin' to be honest with you, this CD doesn't suck, but it won't blow you away either. In fact, the only good song on the whole album is ""Nowhere Again."" But they try hard to be a good band, so I can't disrespect them to much. And the drums are amazing, I mean if that's the kinda' stuff you go for buy this. And the sounds are good, but not as good as Pink Floyd by any stretch. Lyrics is where this band trys to hard to blow your mind like they're Lennon or somebody. But I would buy this CD 'cause it's cool."
3,First rate toppings,"SM provide quality-esque, Lips-like alterna-pop with plenty of mysti-sheen production smothered on to elevate much of the writing past its derivative nature into something way more background-savvy-sexy."
4,Even better live,The reason I only give this album four stars is because these songs were that much better live.
5,absolutely amazing,"in my opinion, secret machines are no where near pink floyd, but i think you can compare the two, because they sound similar, and not many bands sound like this. i think that this album is astounding, i cannot stop listening to it. and if you are a fan of pink floyd, you would most likely me a fan of secret machines. who knows, if they keep it up, someday, not likely, but someday they might just be able to be compared to pink floyd for better reasons than just similar sound. i highly reccommend it."
4,good gun,"This is a pretty good gun for a sidearm. The other guys who left negative reviews have too high of expectations and were probably throwing the guns at each other, because its plastic that will hold up if you treat it right but if you bang it around of course it's going to break. Its like all the other plastic airsoft guns and I recommend it as a cheap gun."
3,Airsoft Enthusiast,"When I rated this a three I looked at it from my nephews perspective, that who I got this gun for. He's 12 and just starting to get into the sport. He loves the thing. I'm going to go out on a limb and buy him a WE gun, so he'll forget about this one, but for a begginner this really is a good gun for the money.Oh and he had the same problem with it breaking, except that it's kinda better now, it doesn't blowback, but it is now fully auto. That's helped him tag me a couple of times."
1,yep... it's a piece of junk...,"You know the old saying ""You get what you pay for""? Well, that's the case here... It's cheap, it doesn't work well, it doesn't even really look that good once you get it... It's just not worth it."
4,Great book,"Kymlicka's Multiculturalism well explains about the importance of cultural pluralism and how to equally treat and respect each distinctive group in the multi nation state such as USA and Canada. This book is not so entertaining, rather it's more like scholastic text book, however the book was very knowledgeable and helpful to understand and accept the reality of multiculturalism in the United States. There's no doubt that Kymlicka's argument and examples to support his thesis were impressively logical and reasonable. Because each typical group is very clearly categorized and precisely explained, it's not so difficult to understand. Recommended for people who're interested in Philosophy, Law, Politics, Sociology etc."
