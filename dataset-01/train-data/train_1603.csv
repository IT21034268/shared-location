3,Amazing Luck..,"***Spoilers***** This was my first James Rollins book and for the most part it was a good read. What I had a hard time buying into was the amazing luck the characters seem to have. Always seemingly on the brink of destruction and then an amazing rescue. The ending seemed a little ""sappy"" to me, but maybe I was looking to hard. All in all I enjoyed it."
5,Excellant THRILLER,This book was great! It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Excitement non-stop! I love this author except for in a few of his earlier books he makes the military guys either bad or look like ding dongs. He seems to have gotten over that which is definately for the better! I have read EVERY book by James Rollins!
3,"Rollins is good, but this isn't his best","James Rollins writes the non-stop action thriller like no one else. Amazing discoveries, unpredictable plot twists and action sequences (including some that kill off main characters) define his writing. The problem with Ice Hunt is that there isn't enough of a change from his previous (and better) books. A discovery underground reveals a new type of creature, that's scientifically interesting and extremely dangerous at the same time.I hate technical inaccuracies, and unfortunately Rollins overdescribes some of the battle scenes. It would not hurt the story if he left in generalities rather than incorrect specifics like a 50mm machine gun.Overall still a pretty good read, especially if you haven't read his other books and gotten bored with the style. I would recommend reading excavation and sandstorm before this to see what Rollins is really capable of."
4,Ice Hunt,"Action packed from start to finish. There were a few spots that were confusing, but overall the book is a 4 star read."
5,CHILLING!,"I have read this book twice. When I saw it as an ebook I couldn't resist getting it. I LOVE this book. It is exciting, scary, riviting, and filled with all kinds of cross stories that intertwine to make an exciting ""can't put it down"" story. My only complaint is the language. I think Mr Rollins could delete some of the ""foul language"" and still have a great book."
2,killed by cliche,"At first I found it sort of interesting, but when I got to the part where the guy meets his ex-wife I threw the book down in disgust.You see, I had read another acton-thriller called ""Quicksilver"" (by Garfield and Judith Reeves-Stevens), in which the hero and his ex-wife try to stop the bad guys from destroying the Pentagon. That book was filled with scenes where the hero and his ex snipe and bitch at each other, and it was *SO* annoying that I nearly didn't finish it.That left such a bad taste in my mouth that when I found the same situation in ""Ice Hunt"", I chucked the book immediately, not wanting to risk reading the same kind of crap that permeated ""Quicksilver"". Maybe I was too hasty, I don't know, but better safe than sorry!"
1,TOO-TOO-TOO MUCH!,"THIS IS NOT THE FIRST ROLLINS WORK I HAVE READ, BUT IT SURELY IS THE WORST--HANDS DOWN!I JUST FINISHED IT AND I'M EXHAUSTED. COLD ARTIC STORMS, FALLING AIRPLANES, CHASES AD NAUSEUM, ONE CALAMITY AFTER ANOTHER--AND JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE--OH MY GOD HERE COMES ANOTHER. MONSTERS REBORN, CRASHING COPTERS, SINKINGS SUBS AND THE OBLIGATORY NUCLEAR THREAT- OH HORROR OF ALL HORRORS.BUT THROUGH IT ALL, LOVE WILL OUT AND OUR HERO AND HEROINE, SOMEHOW MIRACULOUSLY SURVIVE.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!HOESY"
4,"Very good thrilling sci-fi, although a bit error prone","Ice Hunt is my first foray with James Rollins, and I'm generally impressed. I liked the multi-prong story with all of its unusual twists and turns. While I did like the apparant research he did regarding the pre-historic man-whales, I felt that it would have been better is he had a more realistic understanding of the US Military. Other than that, I thought it was a very enjoyable page-turner."
5,Mr. Rollins does it again!,"This is an excellent adventure novel mixed with science and history. You have to cheer for the lead characters... or do you? The plot has many twist and turns that you are not sure where you will go next. Get ready for a great read, find your favorite chair because you will not want to put it down."
2,A Gathering Snowball of Disappointment,"The book starts out very well---as many novels do. I was tremendously excited and thought I was in for a great read. But about a third of the way through I began to detect serious warning signs of deterioration. The plot becomes labored, the situations redundant, the willing suspension of disbelief more difficult, the characters more cartoon-like. And those Grendels---after a while they're simply silly. I became bored. It kept getting worse until I finally, sadly, angrily threw the book in the trash.The book contains a fair number of errors a decent editor should have been able to catch.Rollins has considerable potential, I think, as demonstrated by the superb first part of the book---before the scene shifts to the ice island. Keep trying, buddy.Dog lovers will appreciate his marvelous descriptions of dogs' behavior and the love and respect he clearly feels for them. No wonder: Rollins is a veterinarian."
4,the new Dirk Pitt of action stories,"This was a fun book, with a twist at the end which is unexpected, but possible, given the the government's propensity for double dealing and ""the end justifies the ends"" mentality. However, the author needs to bone up on US Navy ranks, as - referring to the Captain of the nuclear submarine, he mentions the Captain ""receiving his Captain's ""bars"". US Navy captains are the equivilant of Army bird colonels, they wear an eagle. A naval lieutenant wears two silver bars. If you want an on the edge of your seat read, then this is the book for you."
1,Rollins's reach exceeds his grasp in Ice Hunt,"There's no shame in not understanding the details of modern naval telecommunications, or the aerodynamics of flight, or how flight control systems work on aircraft, or the physics of modern weapons, or small-unit military tactics. They're all complex subjects. But why would you showcase those details when you hadn't done the research to write about them in an authentic way? Why would his editor not get someone to review these technical details? I had to drop this book about 75% of the way through it because I couldn't take the inaccuracies any longer. What a disappointment!"
1,"Not just unbelievable, ridiculous!","I really wanted to like this book, but after the first 5 or 6 times the heroes got themselves into impossible situations and then got out of them in comically, ridiculous ways, I started to fade. Then, after the author delves into why the United States is just as bad as or worse than any totalitarian regime, I couldn't stomach it any longer. He stretches so far in his comparisons between Russian, Nazi and US atrocities; it is obvious that he doesn't have the slightest understanding of degrees, exponents and collaboration."
3,Ice Hunt goes cold,"The first two thirds of Ice Hunt was intense and interesting. However, the last third became a tiring, endless series of unprobable circumstances waiting for a movie to be made. Actually, it became boring."
3,book review,"This was the third Rollins' book I've read, and I was a bit disappointed by the walking killer whales. It was like an animated scene from a bad cartoon. If you can get past this, the book still lives up to the suspense and unexpected climax."
4,Constant action!!!,"This book is constantly got you turning pages just to find out what could happen next. I only read before bed. It makes me want to get to bed earlier just so I can read more. Rollins ties in at least 3 story lines from different perspectives and melds them. He takes you places outside the norm. In some cases, places you are glad you're not going. He turns normal people with their baggage and turns them into heroes."
5,Ice Hunt,"This book reads fast, like the rest of the series. Rollins provides page-turner action with just enough terror and intrique to keep your attention. I would not recommend starting this book unless you have some time blocked out to allow total immersion in the story."
1,"New tubes, complete with holes!","Both tubes have leaks in them! Gee, thanks SO MUCH!!! Not worth sending them back to be replaced. VERY disappointed..."
3,Review,I purchased this item and had no issues. The product was what I expected. I have no complaints. That means I will not have a problem purchasing items from this vender in the future.
2,Disappointed,"I was largely disappointed because they had so many facts wrong. They would show pictures or photographs of one tank, and claim it to be another. It was apparent after watching half of it, they didn't bother to do any serious research. The only upside was that they included some rare photographs and footage, much of which I hadn't seen."
2,Hey! I have seen this before????,"I can't say what this was called originally, but its just a new voice-over an old show! I guess it was OK as a ""bargain"" purchase. But, I would not recommend it as you might already have it......"
2,Not too happy w/ this product,Didn't last very long. I have yet to find a mug that you can use in the car that lasts more than 1 month. This one broke after just a few weeks. I was extremely dissapointed.
3,typical colorforms,"I thought my daughter would have fun with this, but she rarely played with it. I bought it for her when she was 1 1/2. I think she found it a little boring moving around pieces of plastic."
1,bows I would like to sell you,"unbelievably transparent marketing attempt from Mr Grays archery company.The book is essentially his internet page in hard copy, plus a couple of extra photos.The text is two dimensional and the bows featured are solely those sold by the authors company, an utter waste of money and very very dissapointing.Save yourself the money and just look at his web page , I would write the address but I dont want to encourage you to give this man more easy money."
4,hkigjkhg,I would have preferred that the transformer had U.K. style outlet receptacles instead of U.S. style.
3,does the job,The product does the job. Although it seems to heat up and buzz more that I really expected. Nice compact design.
1,Do not buy this transformer,"The transformer ""blew up"" when it was plugged in for the very first time in Prague (Czech Republic. It is very heavy (8 lb) and takes a lot of weight from your luggage, especially if it is proven useless."
1,Buyer beware,"I bought one of these, and it is nice, and works fine with one major disappointment. The picture clearly shows TWO US current outlets. The unit I got only has one plug. SO I thought I was saving money, but now I need to buy another one. Its really false advertising! If I knew it only had one US current plug, I would have bought a different unit. Very VERY VERY disappointing"
2,"Spend more, it is worth it","The euro style plug on this box is not grounded, therefore, when it is operating, it is a fire hazard and unsafe and will shock you if you touch it. I also cannot figure out how to get it to operate at the voltages advertised besides going from 110 to 220 or 220 to 110. Says on the box it will do 120V, but I don't think it actually does. This is an issue for picky US appliances that expect exactly 120V. I wish I had just spent a little more and got a quality transformer that I didn't have to worry about burning down my house."
1,stay away,it started off with a weird smell during the first time use. Then smoke came out after using it two times. Stay away from this product.
4,Chunky machine,"Product works fine. Noted that some people complained there wasn't detailed instructions. It is that simple you really don't need them so don't agree with people on that.Only downside is that this is a chunky, heavy box however in a sense this gave me some comfort that is was well made and wasn't about to explode. However difficult to move around if you want to use it in different places in the house."
2,Step Up & Down Transformer,"I have purchased one one Ebay for my X-box 360 (American) I looked at the fuses carefully and noticed they were cracked or blackened which means they got blown out.On top of that when I finally bought some fuses at a nearby store and plugged it in, after 20 minutes it started smoking.Now correct me if I am wrong, as I might be.I live in Germany so I set the input-voltage (on the back) to 220, I plug in my xbox 360 into the 110v output section on the back?I am thinking there is something wrong with the product or something to that effect, help??"
5,Amazing..,I read this as a child and thought that it was so intresting.. to have this point of view about the evoulution of man and animals. Tuaght me so much in my years of growing. Read this!
2,unimpressed..,"i've read a dozen or so outlines in this vien. this isn't very good. sorry don, but your books weak."
5,Extemely insightful and complete.,"This book is all you ever wanted to know about espresso and more. From bean selection to recipes, this book is complete from A-Z. A must have for all coffee lovers."
5,Just what I needed,This book was and is exactly what I needed to learn what it takes to make the perfect Latte or coffee drink....now practice will make perfect. My order came just as it was said to be and in a timely matter. Thanks.
4,Espresso Drinks / Italian Sodas,Excelent book for someone interested in making/consuming 'unique coffee drinks' or Italian Sodas.Very user friendly but not for someone who is just starting to experiment with flavored syrups.
3,The best recipe reference ever written,"We have used this guide as a base reference for making drink recipes for the past 4 very successful years. Our best selling drinks are from recipes in this book. I would recommend the book to any new coffee shop owner, unless you're a Starbuck's (aka Mcdonalds espresso bar)"
2,Not a Very Good Reference Guide,This is one of the worst guides that I have in my collection of specialty coffee books. I rarely pull this book off of the shelf because it is just so poorly laid out. Some of the beverage recipes are good but for the most part I thought that this book was a waste of my time and money. Most syrup manufacturers will give you free recipes that are much better than the ones presented in this text. There are so many other well-written texts on the subject that if I knew then what I know now I would have skipped purchasing this book and saved my money for one of the better guides.
1,this book sucks.,"for anyone attempting to learn about espresso drinks, go somewhere else. This book will insure that you perpetuate the practice of making lousy coffee which has become quite popular in this country. There are some very well informed books out there, and this is not one of them. Save this one for the starbucks crowd."
1,Warning,"Do not purchase.The company advertises that the price includes free website access. Once you purchase the book, the company responds by asking a list of personal questions when you attempt to access their site. The book includes an access code but no password. They refuse to give a passcode until you have answered personal questions.What if you dont want your personal info in someones database? Thats too bad. Apparently the web site / software isn't quite free once you have purchased the book. Boycott this book until they stop asking personal questions that are none of their business. Their excuse is that they need this info to list a student in their database. Do you really think college students should be bullied into giving up personal data? If sales falls off, perhaps they can figure out how to create a unique number in each book so that account numbers are unique. This would mean all a student would need to do would be to choose a unique password and sign on the web site.Do Not Purchase"
1,HELP!!!!!!!,"I am in a beginner physics class this semester and this book is the required text. So far it is like trying to read Greek. I am a relatively good student with the ability to figure out problems but no matter the wording used or the examples given, this book is just plain confusing. The problems at the end of the chapters are rediculously hard and don't seem to be covered in the least little bit within the chapter. The author's attempt at explaining the Pythagorean Theorem was even confusing, shouldn't that be one of the easier ideas? I think I'm in big trouble!!!!!"
1,A Waste of Money,This text book is a waste of time & money! In class we ONLY use it for the questions and they are sometimes incomplete. The class has also found several mistakes in the answer key. Even the answer key sucks! We don't really care about the answer it's how they got the answer that interests us.It's confusing and long winded and terrible. It takes the fun out of physics. Oh wait there is no fun in physics. Damned MCATs!
1,"worst, hardest physics book. waste of time","worst physics book i've ever encountered!!! not enough examples, and the problems are so tough you spend hours doin your hw. your professor probably won't even give you questions that hard on the exam! waste of brain power!! >("
4,Just because the material is hard doesn't mean the book deserves 1 star!,"I am a student who has now been using this book for a semester. The book covers a wide range of topics, moves very quickly, and is by no means simple! Most of the bad reviews are by people who are not able to understand the book because i) the concepts are really complex or ii) they are not supplemented by classroom help. By no means is this book great, but considering how terrible some other physics books are, the new edition of this book tackles complexities in a fairly readable manner."
2,Many better choices,"My daughter is taking high school AP physics with this book. As a former teaching assistant in physics (grad school), this book is terrible in that the chapters give little insight to the information needed to work the problems. Without significant, and excellent, supplement by the teacher this book should not be used."
2,phys. manual review,Bought the manual to help me through the questions step by step but it only has the work/answers for the questions that are indicated after every chapter not all of them.
4,good,The solution guide is better than the text in many respects. I just wish that more solutions were included in the guide. I would recommend it for use with or without the text.
1,Incredibly useless,"I feel sorry for anybody who relies on this book to get a good handle on physics. I am an A student, but I am spending obscene amounts of time trying to comprehend the material. This book (and the accompanying solutions manual) do a lousy job of walking you through the steps to solve many of the problems. The one I am particularly frustrated with is Interactive Example 3.7 (page 66), which tells you at one point to solve for time by using the quadratic formula. They do not bother to show you how they got the answer! The appendix to which it refers you for this particular example, is seriously not helpful. I am spending upwards of 25 hours per WEEKEND studying for physics, and this text does NOTHING to elucidate any of the concepts. I cannot wait to give my input to the department at the end of the semester."
2,Book is cluttered with technical jargon,As a student who is forced to use this book in my Ap Physics class in High School I find this book extremly hard to understand. I also think that this book assumes the reader knows more information that is not known by many readers including all the kids in my class.
3,class book,it's just an other book I needed for school. I even had to get it twice because I did not know I would have to use it in an other class.
2,Who was this written for?,"It doesn't answer all the questions from the questions it covers. The questions it does answer aren't detailed enough to explain much of anything if you don't understand what's going on. I'm pretty disappointed, it is fine if you don't have anything else, I do use it, but that's just because I have nothing else to use. It probably isn't worth it."
1,Worthless,Only has answers to very few problems from each chapter. Explanations of said problems is poorly written and more comfusing then helpful. NOT worth your time or money.
2,Horrible Book,"I have done allot of the questions, and they are poorly written, i would not recommend this book, IT SUCKS :)"
2,Semi Helpful,This book only has some of the solutions for the College Physics book. Not every answer is given; only the answer and solution from the book problems with square around the number. I'd recommend not buying this book and looking for answers online instead.
2,I did not enjoy this book.,I have read every other book by Romano. Had I bought this one first I never would have read any more.
4,Nice read on a winter day...,"His musings on fishing a small local brook, something I am very fond of myself. It was a nice tonic for the winter blues and I enjoyed it very much. It made me just that much more eager for spring to arrive....."
5,Alright! A new edition!,YES! Lonely Planet continues to show us the trail others have blazed! I have used Lonely Planet guides extensively while traveling the interior of West Africa. I have always found them to be candid and accurate pertaining to lodging and dining accommodations. The backpacker's Bible! Thanks for keeping up to date with the rapid changes taking place in W. Africa! See you on the trail......Johnny Connelly
1,Get a West Africa Rough Guide,"Absolutely inadequate to the journey. The guide's too small, completely out of date and really, really not worth its price. The equivalent Rough Guide was just so better."
3,looks good,looks good for the price although I've not used these bits yet and wouldn't expect hex ends for something of this price...and am sure not going to pay 40 bucks for three fuller bits
3,Not a lot of info on Nigeria,"I bought this for a recent trip to Nigeria, and it has a lot of useful general information about West Africa, however the section on Nigeria is not very big. In their defense, there really isn't a lot of tourism in Nigeria (since I spent a month in the country (Abuja) and never saw a single bumper sticker or t-shirt the entire time I was there)."
3,not always accurate but handy to prepare your trip,I used this book going from mauritania down to ghana. Handy to prepare the trip (ex where to go and what to do) but not always accurate for the adresses/phone numbers. An updated edition would be welcome.
1,SMEARED BY DEROGATORY PHRASES,"Indeed, this book (""Lonely Planet West Africa"") did a good job in outlining many of the popular tourist attractions that are located in this Sub-Saharan region of Africa. I also appreciated its details on several tourists' trails, accomodations, means of transportation, and so on. However, I was very disappointed to note that (just like the ""Lonely Planet Africa on a Shoestring"") this book is full of discouraging comments. Some of the phrases Lonely Planet used in this book are quite offensive.For sure, most foreigners who travel to (West) African countries are not expecting to see a paradise, but that does not mean that there is no better way of presenting real and imaginary negative thoughts. This book is smeared by terms and phrases, which I consider derogatory to both (West) Africa and (West) Africans. As a result of this, I will never recommend it to anyone until there is a change of heart by Lonely Planet in subsequent editions."
2,nice cord but...,"I bought the cord to go with a specific religious pendant. The religion is not important here. It is well made, but is too fat to fit through the loop. In order to make it work, I would have to bend the loop of the pendant and make it much rounder. Since it is sold by the same company that I bought the pendant from at the same time, I expected it to fit.If you are considering it, email the company first and ask them if it will fit!"
5,Get this one,This atlas offers you the complete body parts. You will never miss even just a single detail of the part you are looking or studying at. This is the best to use together along with Rohen and to compare with the real human structures for better understanding. Because real bodies are far more hard to understand compared to that of idealized drawings.
1,Accelerated Shipping is Fraud!!,"Accelerated Shipping is Fraud!! They say that anything under $400 can be left, and they charge you twice as much, but then don't leave the book...which means I couldn't give it as a gift (which was the only reason I ordered it accelerated delivery!!!!) DON'T USE IT!!! Afterwards they'll tell you that the ""guarantee"" is covered for anything!"
3,question,This is not a review it is a question. Is the cd rom in windows format or Mac format or both ?
5,Anthological performances!,"As I have stated in previous reciews, the pianism of Gyortgy Sandor, featured by its ferociusness, acidic percussiveness, hellish textures and powerful fingering without falling into cheap exhibitionism of simple technique, has simply dissapeared from the approach of most pianists in these days.His magisterial fingering obeyed to a whole conception of the thematic material. An integral artist who lived and grew up hovered by a febrile commitment of surapssing himself everyday.This set will capture you since the first bars. Admirable expressiveness, loaded with amazing vitality and exuberant flair, conform an album absolutely extraordinary which I wouldn't hesitate unique among the annals of the music.In my personal collection, I've got every album released by this magnificent pianist, and so I can give you blind faith of my affirmation. Buy it before it becomes unavailable."
2,"Bea Lydecker's ""Seasons""","I ""met"" Bea Lydecker online in (I think) a healing-related Internet forum in the early 2000s. For a religion-oriented person this book may be appealing, but her frequent reference to ""God this, God that, God-God-God,"" is distracting to me, so I did not read very far into it. I would gladly DUMP the book at a resale site, only they're SO cheap (often under a dollar - see Amazon's ""Marketplace"" list) that it's not worth the bother to package and ship it. I can just give it away instead, to one of my 'religion' neighbors - they may be delighted with it.No offense to the religion-oriented folks anywhere. My mother was an atheist: Roman Catholic-raised, (terrorized/abused) drop-out/runaway, so we did not get the religion-indoctrination in our home -or- the god-programming routine that seems to compose so much of our species' ""permitted"" (trained) ""belief"" systems."
4,Learning from Choices,"Stories in which 9-12 year olds get to make choices and learn from their choices is invaluable. This modern day story/stories deal(s) with issues that this age group faces on a daily basis. In addition to seeing how others deal with an issue, the reader gets to be a part of the process. This book, similar to the choose-your-own-adventures in structure, also adds an element of how some choices can lead to good things and other choices can lead to not-as-good things. Fortunately, God can work with each situation. Readers, who love fast-moving, plot-based stories, will enjoy this book."
4,A great book for the aspiring polo player...,"A excellent volume on the game and its rules. Lord Mountbatten presents to the reader all the basics (from riding, horses, mallet swings, et.al). For a beginner like myself, it is a classic worth having."
2,"Maybe The Wrong ""Kline"" Cited","I can't discern the precise purpose/audience of this volume. Not a how-to for either teachers or researchers. Nor, I fear, an orientation introduction for generalists. Probably useful as a generously-deep historical survey from the author's own standpoints. He cites the important work of S. J. Kline on ""conceptual foundations"" of integrative work (1995). But he seems (I may have missed it) to overlook the book Interdisciplinarity by Julie Thompson Klein (1990). I would strongly recommend that semi-standard reference (along with Wm. Newell's edited anthology Interdisciplinarity: Essays From The Literature) as much better orientation and starting points for a ""familiarization tour"" of the complex field of interdisciplinary endeavor.The above is only my ""considered opinion."" True, I studied both anthropology and literature, then wrote on interdisciplinary endeavor, then taught it in college. Still, only my opinion--well, let's say ""reasoned judgment."""
1,last song diferent then listed on cd 2,"I waited a whole month for this cd,and they have change the 8 and 16 song on cd #2. It is not (Picture) anymore, it is (Who wouldn't wanna be me) by Keith Urban. Need to have the correct songs listed. I wanted this mainly for one song and I am very disappointed."
2,all of the bells none of the whistles,"I purchased these gloves based on a working persons review of them.I thought that maybe I've finally found a pair of gloves that can withstand the abuse that I dole out. What a joke, I can't imagine what type of working conditions these were meant for. I do a lot of handyman work that covers a broad spectrum of various jobs including carpentry and yard work. All of the gripping surfaces on these gloves have exposed seems that are vulnerable to everything that is handled thus giving way to immediate thread ware. Needless to say once the thread wears the glove falls apart.If I had three months of use out of them I might not have given such a bad review however, these gloves began falling apart after about two weeks. I paid more for these gloves than any pair previously. If you are planning to use these gloves to do any chore requiring gloves, instead buy two or three pairs of the cheapest gloves you can find."
3,Not quite what I thought they would be,"Bought these for yard work. About 3 1/2 hours into the first day, hula hoeing and raking, the seam on the cuff blew out. Luckily I have some industrial (heavy) duty thread from another project that I used to sew up the glove. By the end of the day my fingers were bleeding from the seams rubbing in the cuticle area. I don't know if I just got a bad pair or if this is par for the course since this is the first pair of this brand I've bought. Sand spurs and prickly splines from our desert weeds go right through the fingers offering no protection. Honestly the cheapo $9.99 leather gloves from Home Depot do better. They are well padded and they fit true to size. Maybe they'll do a better job protecting my knuckles when I change out the steering stabilizer on the Jeep today."
4,Great glove for general yardwork.,"So I have another pair of older youngstown gloves, and they've been great. This new pair has held up well to several weekends of land clearing.Pros:Kevlar lining gives you a small advantage when playing with bladed objects.Palm material wears very well in abrasive use.Velcro tab is easily operated while wearing gloves.Terry cloth material thumb is great for wiping sweat.Foam ""padding"" stays reasonably warm when soaking wet in 5 degree weather.Cons:Kevlar lining really won't stop BIG slicy things. The rating is midrange.Glove stretches MUCH less than their non-kevlar models.Grey back of the glove is not very abrasion resistant.Velcro tab is stiff and won't stick at lower temps.No wrist coverage, at least on me.I would give them 5 stars, but the backs of mine look like hell already. They're still functional, and look like they've got a lot more to go, but they certainly aren't very abrasion resistant on the top."
2,Find for Work Gloves Only.,"I was expecting these to protect against cutting while using a chainsaw. However, the inside label says that it does not protect from cutting, piercing, or heat. Then why call them Kevlar gloves?"
2,Great fit - Poor quality control,"Ordered 2 pairs of XXL - 1st arrived today, skipped stitches in 2 stress points before wearing. I don't anticipate that these will last long. They do fit well, and the price on Warehouse Deals was ok. If I'd paid full price, they'd be in a return box already."
5,Great Gloves,"Use these gloves for all types of housework from pruning roses to changing the blade on my lawnmower. I wouldn't operate a saw and stick my fingers in and test the gloves out, but it definitely protects my hands from any minor cuts / scrapes.Very easily to clean and keep clean as well. Highly recommended."
5,Youngstown Gloves,"These gloves and the scraper I bought were sent together. I was surprised at how fast they were delivered. She totally loves them. I just wish I had paid a little more attention to the size. They are a bit big, but they feel wonderful on the inside, I was told."
4,great gloves,"These gloves are great for every day use! They feel bulky at first but when you put them on your hands they are very flexable, comfy and super light weight! As for the cut resistence, I can not comment and I hope I dont need to. I work on a Navy ship dealing with engines, valves and tons of piping systems. These gloves help a bunch and I have no negitive comments currently. I would definitely get these for friends of mine here."
4,Youngstown Glove 05-3080-70-L General Utility Lined with Kevlar etc..,"Good fit. Arrived with a bad stitch on one finger, recvd a 20% standard rebate from AMZ, sewed by hand the bad seam. The warning label in the glove reads ""Not Cut-Proof, Puncture Proof,Fire Retardant or Heat-Resistant. Do Not Expose Near Open Flames,high heat, Sparks or Arc Zones. Do Not Use While Operating Power Machinery"". One might ask what these gloves are good for. I dunno.. 4 stars because they fit well and have a good grip, and for the price they better wear well. I assume the Kevlar will be a plus factor handling brush and old lumber. UPDATE 5/09: Wundaful cleaning up the Raspberry patch!! No problemo messing with thorny canes. UPDATE 12/3/09: After nine months of gardening, fire wood sawing and stacking, hard use in general, no sign of wear on the work surfaces of the gloves. Usually a lessor glove that I have used for identical applications, would have worn out the left hand glove."
1,youngtown CUT resitance glove 05-3080-70-L,"the very first time a accidently TOUCHED this glove, for a split second, to the band saw blade, the blade cut right through the protected thumb and cut my thumb. Thanks to very quick reflexes, I STILL have my thumb. Don't believe ""cut resitance""."
5,Stopped splinters and cuts,"My hobbies include building furniture and using copper for artwork. I was always picking splinters out of my hands and putting band aids on cuts. The gloves have stopped this. They allow good finger dexterity but no glove makes picking up small screws & nails easy while wearing them. They fit well and are comfortable.I hope no one thinks that Kevlar gloves will protect their hands from table saw blades, drills, etc. The human brain can do a pretty good job on that."
3,"Asia-Alpha, perhaps not....","I had doubts about purchasing this album based on other reviews. I recently saw them in concert and decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I did. It isn't as good an album as their first self-titled album, Asia, which truly was their alpha album, but it isn't a bad follow-up. Really, how could they top their monstrously successful first album?! I would have given it 4 stars, but the recording isn't top-notch. I had to to some tweaking in i-tunes to even get any volume out of it.P.S. Steve Howe is in his 70's and still plays guitar better than many guitarists today. I was amazed with his skills in their recent Phoenix tour!!!"
5,Alpha Review,I had this DVD before only lost it due to a B&E. It's great to have the music back again. I listen to it almost constantly. I'll probably wear it out. What can I say? I like most of Asia's music.
3,Worth A Listen,"In some ways ""Alpha"" is better than Asia's initial release. A lot of this album is soft and syrupy, but that's not a bad remark. Every song on here is good. ""Don't Cry"" is great; I remember hearing this song on the radio years ago when I was a kid. ""Never In a Million Years"" sports some great trademark Asia backing vocals. ""Last to Know"" and ""Open Your Eyes"" are also pretty good. I wish this album would have been a little heavier, but hey, Asia was never very heavy to begin with. Worth a listen."
4,"Good, but not as good as their first","This is a good second part from their debut album, the music style is the same.I recommend this CD but dont expect more than the Asia first album (a masterpiece).It was the second and last release from the original line up: Wetton, Downes, Howe & Palmer."
4,"The smile had left their eyes, but it's a good 2nd effort","Not as focused as the first ASIA. Yet it contains their 2 best songs of their career, Midnight Sun and Open Your Eyes and for those 2 gems it should not be overlooked. The band was breaking up and you can here it in the stale arrangments, but It's still very good 80's pop rock."
5,Classic Arena Rock,"Asia's second album continued the style and sound of their first. Provided you like their first album you will enjoy this as well. Alpha was Asia's last strong release that featured their strong, in your face, brand of progressive arena rock. The songs are catchy and the musical talent of all involved is something that needs to be heard to fully appreciate."
5,Don't believe in AMG's review!,"When I first time listened to this album, I didn't like it a lot because it sounded boring. Later, I listened Alpha again but still it didn't sound any better than last time. Third listening time told me the truth! This is a exciting and reflexing album. You won't maybe love this when you listen to Alpha first or second time, but you should continue and find a real Alpha's heart. Asia's debut is classic and it is difficult to be not compering Alpha for it. In opinion, Alpha is almost as good as Asia. Sounds has changed dramatically and some people won't like these new and fresh sounds. All Asia's musicians have still excelent skills to play interesting music in their own way. Downes and Wetton duo have written 10 songs which are simply fine and shine songs. My favourite tracks are The Heat Goes On, Never In a Million Years and Open Your Eyes. The end of Open Your Eyes song is one of the Asia's best and it shows clearly their unbeliable musicial skills."
3,Barnegat photo book,"Great old photos of Barnegat and several people, some probably relatives, have been identified. Would have liked more text with additional facts & history."
2,Attractive but flawed,"This tissue holder is very attractive and matches other bathroom items that we have. It works particularly well if you have brass fixtures (e.g. faucets) in your bath. However, it is important to note that this is a COVER for a tissue box, not a container. The holder has no bottom. If someone reaches to pick it up, the tissue box stays on the counter and they have only the holder in their hand. What is even more important is the fact that if you slide the holder across your counter top, it will scratch the counter. (We have Corian) The scratching occurs because the metal edges are directly on the counter since there is no a base on the holder to elevate the metal edges."
2,not for in the car,"The CDs only contain Japanese, which makes them frustrating to listen to unless you already have the meanings memorized or if you have the book open in front of you. Definitely not for learning in the car."
1,"""... LIFELESS Language Complete Courses....""","As a language teacher, I was extremely disappointed with the enclosed textbook and CDs. The book consisted of a series of vocabulary lists, short, decontextualized phrases and grammar lessons. The audio CDs were one person simply reading through the vocabulary lists and phrases. The course was not structured in meaningful ways to help the learner retain the language or communicate in Japanese. The addition of some authentic dialogs with audio recordings would have improved the course significantly."
5,Author practices what he preaches,"I know Jon and can tell you that his ministry reflects the fact that he is giving youth a compass to guide them in life. In my experience with youth pastors, he has developed more young people to understand, appreciate and accept a personal-call in their life for ministry. In this way Jon's ministry extends itself in exponential ways. In addition, Jon teaches Youth Ministry at the University where I work."
4,Thunderbirds of World War 2,"The box set of two discs covers the spitfire,the hurricane,the stuka and the b-17.The history of each plane is exzamined along with old trainning films and gun camera action,worth adding to your world war 2 collection."
5,I was there,"This is a brilliant book. As an extremely minor player in the drama of the '76 Republican Presidential race, I have an intense interest in the subject. Mr. Shirley has done enormous original research, and he has done a masterful job of explaining the historic context and ultimate impact of the Ford-Reagan race. Thank God for ""amateur historians""."
3,"Good CD, So-So Sound Quality","Brings back lots of high school memories, but I wish the sound was better. I listened to this album on cassette for many years, and though it's great to have the convenience of the CD version, both sound almost the same to me.Thankfully, the songs are still enjoyable to listen to. BONUS: You can finally find out what Jack Hues sings on ""Dance Hall Days"" because lyrics are included. Same with ""Don't Let Go,"" which I loved for years and just recently learned what the second verse's lyrics were.Though the drums and synths are pretty much out of date, this CD is a testament to an earlier era of MTV pop, circa 1983 - 4, before American artists like Huey Lewis, the Boss, and Mellencamp stormed the charts to take back the flag. Wang Chung had the last laugh, though, when they scored two smash singles in 1986 - 7 from their ""Mosaic"" LP, which is also recommended."
3,Has quality but not their best,"Probably my least favorite Wang Chung album. My fave is ""Warmer Side Of Cool"", which I consider a remarkable and practically timeless album. I got this because I wanted to check out all their stuff. Aspects of this seem dated in an '80's sort of way. Performance is fine, but the writing and arrangements don't compete with WSOC. This is not a BAD album, but it doesn't grab me. There might be a few tunes better than the rest of the album. I would recommend this only to super fans or the very curious. I might listen to it again a long time from now. Usually within 2 listens I pretty much know what I think forever, and I did give it 2 listens."
5,A Timeless Classic,"20 years have come and gone, and yet Points on the Curve still stands the test of time. The combination of Jack Hues (vocals), Nick Feldman (bass guitar), and Darren Costin (drums) make for one of the best bands of the 1980s. POTC is an excellent collection of pop, dance, and new wave music, with just a hint of rock in it. From the #1 dance hit ""Dance Hall Days"" all the way through ""Talk it Out"", this is one of the few albums with strong material all around and which you just can't stop listening to, over and over and over...-RoMo37--DECEMBER 19, 2008"
2,"The disc arrived well, but ...","The disc arrived without damage, but the little box they sent me the CD was broken and risked damage the disc. Also, I expected the CD come with the original box and documentation provided by the manufacturer, but it was not."
4,An enjoyable read,"This is the first book in the ""gaslight"" mystery series. I already read books 6, 7 and 8, and enjoyed them, so I went back to read the first book. Thompson has 2 interesting protagonists in Sarah Brandt and Frank Malloy. The story line moves along and there are some surprises along the way. Set in New York City in late 1800's this book has the added touch of history. Not heavy reading, just a good quick book."
2,Underlying theme is sex,"I received the first three books in this series as a gift. As a lover of Victorian era mysteries, I thought I would love these as well. Although the stories are pretty good, the underlying theme of all them is sex. Incest, sex-for-favors, abortion, ... It's not explicit, thankfully, but I have no desire to read book after book about sex. I cannot give it more than two stars for that reason."
5,First series,"This is the first in the Gaslight Series and a fun debut it is. Sarah and Frank meet and begin their unusual relationship. It's fun to follow their adventures, and the mystery is well written as well. Wonderful read."
1,BORING BORING BORING,I picked up this book in the hopes of finding a new historical mystery series along the lines of the John Fielding series by Bruce Alexander. I could not have been more off the mark. I can't begin to explain how BORING this book is. I continued to read it hoping that the action would pick up. Don't waste your time on this one. Pick up 'Blind Justice' by Bruce Alexander.
3,"Good story, but not original","I've read all of Anne Perry's Victorian mystery novels and was looking for something else when I picked this up. If I wasn't familiar with Perry's work, this would have been a great book, but unfortunately, swap London for New York and it's almost identical: crime-fighting aristocratic nurse, hard-bitten cop, death in the posh part of town. Substitute Sarah & Frank for Hester & Monk and it's the same old setup, only not told quite as well. If you haven't read Perry's novels, I'd recommend them over these, they have more depth, but this is Thompson's first story so perhaps the rest of the series gets better. I haven't decided yet whether to continue reading them."
4,Love the genre and the talent,"Victoria Thompson has captured my heart. Found this, her first book by chance - read it in an evening and went out the next day and bought the next 5 books of the series. The 1900's is a favorite time period of mine - and Ms Thompson's ability to capture and own the reader from the get-go is amazing. The ""profession"" of her heroine is fresh and historically possible. And her protagonist, the cop Malloy, is not quite curmudgeon nor is he easily likeable. No - Ms. Thompson has reached into the depths of these characters, flawed them and wrote a plausible story line to introduce them - to the reader and to each other. Great and rapid read."
4,My favorite kind of mystery!,"I admit it -- I love books where the author blends little known facts with her plot, and Victoria Thompson has done exactly that with her first mystery. Not only does she give us an intriguing story, but she also laces it with fascinating details about turn-of-the-century New York City.Colorful characters who come alive, a true-to-life setting and an interesting plot -- what more could a reader ask? The only flaw I found were a number of grammatical errors, notably incorrect homonyms, that the copy editor should have corrected, but those were minor and shouldn't stop anyone from clicking ""add this to my shopping cart."""
3,Tough call,"If the purpose of a murder mystery is to surprise the reader with the identity of the killer and the how and why it was done, this book didn't pass the test. I saw the ending coming like a T-Rex down Broadway. On the other hand, as a novel, it satisfied me enough. The characters and their situations were well-drawn, and intriguing. While you knew the relationship between Sarah and Frank would intensify, it was fun watching it develop. I liked the book well enough, but the ending let me down.Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points"
4,Good reading,"I'm a fan of historical mysteries and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's easy to read and the pace moves fast enough without excessive dialogue and characters. I liked the way she weaved details about life in that era and of course, the love-hate chemistry between Sarah and Frank. I was dying to read her other books and to my utmost disappointment, the libraries in Singapore only have this one. I'm gng to buy the rest of the books and add them to my book collection!"
2,Kinda boring,"I'm 4/5 of the way through this book and I'm still waiting for the wow-suspense-factor.Maybe it'll come at the very end. Still, slightly disappointed."
3,I enjoyed the characters but this book isn't for everyone.,"My comment is exactly in line with Rocco Dormarunno's entitled ""Touch call"". I enjoyed the book enough but the story was not even close to being original. By the 5th chapter, the book has 14, I could tell how the book was going to end. So basically the mystery in the book was useless but I enjoyed the development of the two main characters. I enjoyed it enough that I will purchase the next book in the series to see it the mystery is better and to see the progress of the two characters. It would be hard to recommend this book without knowing the type of reader that wants the recommendation. If you want an in-depth well developed mystery then it's not for you. If you're like me and enjoy the character but don't really care about the mystery then you'll enjoy it. Judging a book is very subjective so to help you better understand what I like to read: Massie Dobbs, Mrs. Pollifax, and Bruce Alexander's John Fielding books."
4,Good Old-fashioned Mystery!,"The Gas Light Mysteries series with characters Sara Brandt and Det. Frank Mallory were true mysteries. I've read the entire series in order. It was much better that way. The setting was particularly dear to me as I am a native New Yorker and have been to many of the places described in these turn-of-the-century books.Victoria Thompson's newest book in this series - Murder On Sisters Row, June 2011, Berkley Hardcover. I've already pre-ordered it.If you love New York history, check out these books on Amazon.com:New York Then and Now (Then & Now Views) [Paperback] - Edward B. Watson (Author), Edmund V. Gillon Jr. (Author)New York Then and Now (Then & Now) [Hardcover] - Annette Witheridge (Author)"
5,Looking for a good book---this is it!!!,This is Caleb Carr and Anne Perry rolled into one. Victoria Thompson writes a brilliant suspense and places it perfectly in old New York. I've fallen in love with the characters and can't wait for the next book!
2,Unecessarily sordid,"I must admit I'm picky, but I don't read mysteries for the gory details. This had some interesting characters but contained too much detail on emotional and physical cruelty. It could have been far more subtle and much more compelling. I also guessed most of the solution halfway through. If the author had focused more on exploring the emotional interplay it would have been more sophisticated and enjoyable."
4,First of a great historical mystery series,"Light mysteries with lovable characters. Set in New York City during the 1890's, a midwife born to the upper crust but making her own way...with the help of an Irish police officer."
4,Astor Place,"I enjoy reading mystery books. I will be reading more of the Victoria Thompson mysteries, as I found them easy to follow.Fun to read the book because of the city and history of the area."
2,Too loose with the facts for a documentary,"There are spoilers below. So read no further if you care about such things.On a technical note, unlikeHelvetica, which I also watched on Amazon's Video on Demand, this film sound was plenty loud enough on my laptop's built-in speakers.My main complaint is that the movie makers falsely injected drama into the story by playing loose with the facts, as a little post-movie research revealed.The film repeatedly showed a graph of the Donkey Kong scores with Billy Mitchell's 1982 score at the top. In fact, Steve Wiebe beat that score in 2003, and when his taped, million-point score was rejected, he was still the official Donkey Kong record holder. Moreover, when Mitchell submitted his own tape, beating Wiebe's new record set at the FunSpot event, it was initially accepted (as shown in the film) but ultimately rejected (omitted from the film), leaving Wiebe as champ.I like niche documentaries, but this one didn't measure up."
5,..and Billy is such a Bi@%h!,"This is the best moive I've seen since The Departed...I just wish I had taken the time to see it in the theatre.The characters that fill this movie are incredible (from lowly bottom feeders to ""Class Acts""), you just can't make this stuff up....and please, of please, if you live in Florida - DO NOT EAT at Billy's restaurant. I hear he pisses in the hot sauce."
5,Steve Wiebe is The Man!,"I was told by a friend who's movie opinion I usually trust to watch this movie so I did, albeit reluctantly. I mean seriously a movie about Donkey Kong records? Who gives a monkey butt, right? Well, watching the delusion that some of these record holders have and the lengths sham officiating orgs like ""Twin Galaxies"" will go to to keep people they want on top and keep others down is enthralling. Let's just say that Steve Wiebe is the King of Kong and more. HE's cool. Twin Galaxies is a self-serving sham."
4,Steve Wiebe Rocks!,"I first caught this doc on G-4 with my husband (who thought it was one of the best doc's he had ever seen), which caused me to purchase a copy of the dvd for him. He's watched it several more times and enjoys it each time. He's even considering a trip to Billy Mitchell's restaurant just to make a Steve Wiebe proclamation. I have to admit it was a very entertaining movie. It just boggles my mind that people are so intense on arcade games. And if you don't walk away hating Billy Mitchell for being the biggest a** and then laughing hysterically at how you just route for Steve Wiebe until the very end! A must watch!"
5,"Not a fan of documentaries, but this was awesome!","I grew up in the 80's. I played arcade games. I went into the Army and got over the games. I still love them but I moved on. Obviously there is a subculture of people that did not. If you like exploring different worlds (climbing Everest, Dirty Jobs, cave diving) etc. that you have zero chance of entering then this is a great film. If you do not stay away. Like others I thought I would only like this movie because of my past affiliation with Kong, but I think it's more of a journey to anywhere attitude you must have to enjoy this film. As in most of these types of adventures it comes down to enjoying the characters personalities as much as what they are doing. A great rent. Special features are awesome too."
4,Good Doc,"Ok, pretty doc to show people so into video games, classic gaming. So, what's up with Billy Mitchell's hair??? Is this doc taped in the 80's?? I believe Steve addressed any doubts anyone had on his record breaking score and was done in person. No matter what, Billy Mitchell was given the title because he submitted a video tape. ..something which Billy Mitchell didn't believe in and he said nothing is official if not done live at Twin Galaxies.Doc...4 starsBilly Mitchell's hair. . .ZERO star"
3,INTERESTING DOCUMENTARY IS OK TO WATCH ONCE!,"Running only 70 minutes, it's hard to call this a movie. It's a documentary about world record holders for old classic video games. While I found it mildly entertaining, I can't see ever watching this again.......and I like video games! It's OK and certainly worth a look. Billy Mitchell comes off as some delusional geek that thinks he is some sort of god! OK, OK, it's very hard to do what he did, but in the end, who really cares? ......maybe a couple of thousand geeks...that's who! I remember playing video games until my fingers were deformed and had many incredible scores myself, but that was then and this is now. Let it go boys.....let it go!To each their own, if they still get a charge out of playing 'Donkey Kong' more power to them!"
2,I don't understand the hype!,"This movie has a lot of hype surround it. Can't say I get why it is so hyped after seeing it.The ""hero"" in the documentary Steve Wiebe is worth cheering for. However, I didn't like any of the other people in the story. This documentary is weird."
5,Great book for frustrated parents!,"I was having problems with my two daughters, 5 and 3. They were fighting constantly over anything and everything and my 5 year old was becoming aggressive with her sister and me. Biting, hitting, kicking... I was so frustrated at the end of everyday. Time outs and loss of privileges just weren't working anymore. I ordered this book out of desperation! I am so glad I did! After reading and implementing some of these common sense approaches, our house has been so much more peaceful. This book was helpful in redirecting my energy to encouraging good behavior rather than punishing the bad behavior."
2,Good jumping off point...,"I this book would have been much better if it had more creative ideas for rewards and not as much common sense. I found that a lot of the ""ideas"" that were displayed in this book were things that I had already learned just by observing my kids. I think trial and error got me further then this book did."
3,Not very many reproduceables,Although I did somewhat like this book because it describe the methods to use with each of the rewards. The bad thing was that I expected there to be way more samples for us to copy.
4,Great resource - Hard to reproduce charts - Needs a CD,"Overall, great book. I just wish I was able to reuse some of the charts."
1,Not what I was looking for,"Bought book based on the title, and once I received it, it was nothing what I expected and didn't even use it. I ended up donating it for a silent auction. It was too complicated and was just way too much work. I wanted a basic but worthwhile reward system for my kids, this wasn't it."
2,"It's ok, if the conditions are perfect.","I've purchased this to replace the Nikon 885:pros: small, fast start up, two memory card slots, great portraits shots, 5mp for 400 bucks!cons: system error, average customer service from Konica, low light (dawn, dusk) conditions there is not enough light, can't handle action shots, movie mode, only 30 sec and can not use zoom when taking a movie, but there is audio while nikon does not.my ex-nikon 885 can hadle the cons of the Konica, but it is not small, the start-up is too slow.KD-500Z is a prefect camera if you don't use it for low light and sports.I am checking out the Canon A70 next!"
2,poor service,"I had this camera six weeks when the battery charger quit. Konica's solution was for me to pay for tracked shipping and they would repair and return within 3 to 4 weeks! I find that totally unacceptable for a brand new product in this price range. I will never buy another Konica product, although I like the camera when it works."
5,"Good quality, features, and price","We are very happy with your Konica KD-500Z. The pictures are sharp and we like all the features, especially the ability to film short videos with sound. Our last digital camera download setup was a nightmare of fire wires and software. Setting this one up to download couldn't be easier!"
3,ehh..idk about it,mine didnt come with the stopper to keep it from sliding down the shower head. so it really isnt all that useful. AND its cheaper at meijer.
3,Sturdy and compact,Exactly as shown and certainly fulfills my needs. Disappointed that it arrived slightly damaged as the arm of the top shelf was not connected to the base. As the price was very inexpensive I did not want to deal with returning it but glued it myself and so far it is holding up.
1,Poor Description,"This is a lot smaller than it looks. It's no wonder that the picture used for this listing is as small as it is- to keep it vague and limit your imagination. It says that there's suction cups included. I definitely did not receive it and without them, the caddy slides back and forth and you have to properly balance the items on it so it doesn't lean to one side. It's otherwise great for what it is used for. I just wish that the seller was more honest about what the buyers get."
3,It's Ok,"The caddy is kinda small, but that's ok. Mine didn't come with the suction cups that hold it to the shower wall! So now it's not secured, but it still works."
5,Borrowers Afloat,"A very enjoyable read, fun for all ages! What fun to go back and read about the little people again. Wish there were more books about them, I would buy them. My grandchildren have enjoyed having me read this to them as well."
4,Very good book,I liked this book alot. It kept me very interested. There were some funny parts but mainly exciting adventures. This is a good book for a second or third grader. I am in second grade.
3,The Borrowers Afloat,"One time I saw a movie it was called The Borrowers. I thought it might be a little bit like the book. I thought it would be about borrowers who were on the river in a teapot. The cover gave a large hint. Borrowers are tiny people only about six inches high. Borrowers can not live without people. A family of three borrowers are living inside of a cotige wall,then the owners suddenly move out. There is one place called Little Fordham where borrowers live so they set out to find it. There were some parts that were slow but it got better toward the end. If you like books with little people mabye you want try it?"
3,Very Clinical,"While there a number of recipes included in the book as well as an excellent description of what Candida and how to identify it. It is a little too clinical, and hard to wade through all of information."
2,not up to date with modern cuisine,"I ordered the book hoping to find some good recipes to use with my candida diet, which has been working really well. I tend not to cook on this diet since most recipes contain some ingredients that are not allowed. The reviews were favorable so I ordered the book. The recipes though are not appealing to me and seem to be really out of date. They don't reflect the almost 20 years since that have been such a renaissance for the culinady field. It Doesn't make use of any of the new, varied, ethnic ingredients that are available now. The look if the book is also not appealing. It looks like 1989 (or earlier) in the oldfashioned typsest and hideous cover, althought I know it should not be judged by that alone. Food publishing has come so far though, that it is hard to get excited by this book. If anyone knows another book that is more current, I would love to know!"
2,OK,"I bought this book because my doctor put me on this diet. I did learn some thins, but I was somewhat disappointed. There does not seem to be a ""standard"" for the Candida Diet.This book disagrees with what my doctor told me I could eat.I should have paid more and bought the book ""Eating Your Way to Good Health."""
2,Simplistic recipes that leave out steps,"I like the information in this book, but most of the recipes don't work well if you follow them as outlined in the instructions. There are either missing steps, such as tenderizing chicken, or instructions that are just plain wrong, such as making sauces (you need some liquid!) or reheating a dish that has ""homemade mayonnaise"". I don't think many of these recipes were actually tested. If you are new to cooking, don't buy this book because you'll be frustrated when things don't turn out."
5,Great Guide to better health,"Found it very helpful in teaching me how to eat well. Receipes were great and I have enjoyed the ones that I have tried so far. It gave me a great guide on how to live this new way of eating to get me back to feeling well. In fact, better than ever."
2,Buyer Beware,"Being desperate for ideas as to what to make my 13 year old son who is on a Candida Diet, I thought I had found a gold mine on discovering this book. I was disappointed, however, when I checked with my naturopath regarding the safety of vegetable glycerin, and was told that it could cause diarrhea and/or dehydration, and he suggested that I look for an alternative sweetener. I have had some success using Ms. Burton's recipes substituting stevia. But thanks for trying, Ms. Burton, for so many of us this is a recurring problem."
5,i am soooo depressed,that none of friends even knows about this song...think i am gonna dump them all...
3,Who You Are Is How You Parent,"This book helps parents take a closer look at who they are and how their personal style and temperament influences the way they parent. The 3 step approach offered in this book helps parents increase self-awareness, gain a better understanding of the cues given by their child, and make parenting decisions that are responsive to the child. I found the authors' examples to be very helpful and often applicable to many different situations. The questions to the reader, offered in each section, tended to interrupt the flow of the book, but are great points of discussion for parents. Overall, this book approaches parenting with a true sense of respect, both for parents and children."
5,"The Go-To Mom Gives ""Bringing Up Baby"" 5 Gold Stars","Wonderful book and very insightful for the new parent. I like how the authors encourage families to take a look at their past to make connections with the present and how they parent. A must read.

5,THIS IS THE TOTALLY #1 BEST BOOK HE HAS EVER DONE!,"This was by far the absolute favorite of mine because of the cute and funny content. This also has a good ending moral value of what Christmas really is. This book is traditionally read every year during the holiday season at my house. It is a book for everyone! My favorite part is,""He turned around fast, and he saw a small Who! Little Cindy-Lou Who, who was not more than two. The Grinch had been caught by this tiny who daughter Who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water. She stared at the Grinch and said, Santy Clause , why, Why are you taking our Christmas Tree? Why?"" Dr. Seuss is a wonderful author and illistrator and has really touched me with his simple book of morals, funny characters, and intresting plots. He is number one in children's books and especially his work in,"" How the grinch Stole Christmas."""
5,GREAT STRINGS!,"After growing tired of broken strings and the overly bright tone of GHS Boomers I switched to Dean Markley NickelSteel seven years ago, with my last set of strings lasting over 5 years. I'm not even changing them because they broke, but rather the pungeant odor that developed after years of playing with the same set. They also sound great. The added nickel mellows out the tone very nicely, giving them a WONDERFUL balance of highs and lows perfect for Metal, Hard Rock, Alternative AND Blues. Oh, not to mention they've got a price that supports my stingy ways."
3,any idiot knows the details in this book,"Upon receipt of this item and a browse through I immediately decided to return it. The information contained within is basic info and person that has traveled more than once in their life as an adult will know. There was a lot of information about travel in general and very little about actually traveling solo. But, if you are looking for general travel info the book is quite complete."
2,Low Quality,"We bought this for our 10 yr old son, he loved it the first few days...then we had to take it down to mow the yard. After several times of putting this up/down the plastic stakes began to bend and break. Now we are stuck surfing the net to find replacement parts and I've become very creative as to set up, but not having any luck finding reliable support."
2,Nice at first,"We bought this for our 12 yr old and 9 yr old to practice in the off season. It was great the first few days. Then we had a storm and the wind broke one of the poles. We repaired it with a new piece of PVC pipe. Everytime we had to take it down for wind, mowing, etc. it got a little more flimsy. Now we cannot use the net now at all."
4,"Raid 5 for $200, not bad.","I've been using this card for over a year now and it's been solid. I have the card paired with a EnhanceBox E8, which is an 8-bay esata port multiplier enclosure. Most of the video I do is in 1080p and I never experience any hic-ups. If your are looking for an alternative to some of the more costly HD editing setups, I highly recommend this system. I now have three of these setups."
1,Rocket Raid Crash on Mac OS 10.6.2,"Rocket Raid for a MacPro Tower. Downloaded latest raid software, driver, firmware could not be located for Mac. Loaded driver and raid software-crashed computer. Contacted support-no solution. Removed driver and raid software & cleaned up machine with TechTool. Reloaded latest software and driver--crashed machine on startup twice, then started ok. tried a restart, crashed machine on shutdown.I returned the product--standing policy, if a new product can't provide up-to-date software for Mac OS it goes back."
2,Unreliable Sata Card/Zero Customer Support,"Very finicky sata card. Seems to work with external RAID housings...card usually recognizes and mounts drives. If I only used external housings, I give it at least four stars, but I have a Sata Drive Dock in the mix and this is where it fails miserably.I'm using a Thermaltake BlacX dock on a Mac Pro 12 core. When a drive is inserted into the dock, the card only recognizes and mounts it 40% of the time. Very frustrating. To get it to mount, you have to launch the web interface control panel software (slow) and do a bus rescan...and another...and 4 more. And then, if you're lucky, it may mount. Such a time waster.Contacted Support and they said the card was never tested with Thermaltake. Unfortunately, there isn't a list of compatible docks, so, roll the dice!Unfortunately, I gave this card too many chances to work and the Return Window has shut. Bottomline: If you're not using external drive docks, go for it. Otherwise, avoid the hassles."
2,Shipped without a working Battery!!!!!,"I have just received this phone, charged the battery for the recommended amount of time and the battery STILL does not stay charged!!!Panasonic customer service is HORRIBLE! I spent 1 hour on hold with them and they would not replace the battery!I will never deal with them again."
2,Misguided,"As a professional forester in Appalachia, I was enthralled by the historical perspectives presented in this book, and appalled by some of the statements the author made. The obvious and uninformed anti-logging approach to the national forests of Appalachia sounds really good, but come to the Daniel Boone and you will understand what devastation this has brought us. Uncontrollable wildfires, outbreaks of insects that threaten whole habitats and species, and economic hardships on an already depressed area. Management of our forests for multiple uses is essential. At the same time, the author interviews and praises the wife of a logger who brags about diameter limit cutting, which is just a fancy name for high-grading, which further degrades the forest.If this topic interests you, read the first couple of chapters, and then move on. The rest of the book is the same old droll that the public is barraged with on a daily basis. This book sure had potential."
3,The politics of photography,"No man can write out of his bourne of time and space,but the author clearly displays his contemperary trendy left wing biases to the point that his essay on the art of looking at photographs is somewhat occluded.His illustrations are not irrelevant, but his neglect of photography within the last 15 years or so is difficult to justifyAltogether well below the usual high standards of the Oxford Companions"
5,The Photograph by Graham Clarke,"While no criticsm can be complete, this book offers one of the best points of departure for anyone trying to understand the history of the photograph. It is at times outdated in its thinking, but it is always thought provoking. If you're serious about looking at photographs, you must read this book."
1,Avoid This Book,I found this book hard to read. The writing style of the author is overly wordy and he does not seem to develop his ideas in a readable manner. I would suggest that a potential purchaser looks elsewhere first to see if they can find a book that fulfills their needs better.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CHAIN,"Ok, So I bought this chain for my motorcycle. It look cheap and then I read online somewhere, that cheap chains are only coated with harden steel, So I took my 4ft bolt cutter and cut a link off, and it went through like butter, I DIDNT EVEN TRY HARD AND THESE BOLT CUTTER ARE OLD AND BEAT UP. After I cut the link in half you could see how the chain was plated, so after all that I went and bought a Onguard chain,, MUCH BETTER"
4,Pretty good book,"This is a good book (even though it is fairly old) for learning the basics of BASIC (no pun intended). It assumes that you have had experience in algebra and geometry, and focuses more on the mathematical aspect of BASIC as opposed to creating games with it. You won't create complex programs but you can create simple programs to solve equations and complex math problems. Also read ""The absolute beginners guide to programming"""
5,Book of Poems,"I ordered the book because Robert Service was a relative of my Grandmother. So, it was kind of special to me to have a collection of his work"
1,disney's princess magical dress up by disney interactive,"I got the disney's princess fashion boutique and unless they have upgraded substantially, it is NOT WORTH THE MONEY,,,I took the boutique back twice and it never worked correctly. They said I could send it to the company...and they might replace it. ...so as far as I am conserned I will NOT be buying any more disney games for my 2 little girls. Thought you might like to know."
4,Perfect for my little Princess,"I got this for my preschooler for Christmas and she is loving it! I love the fact that she can design the princess to look like herself or a friend or just about anyone! Designing the dress and jewelry is her favorite part, but she could go all day if I let her! This is definitely a gift that won't lose its appeal soon and also one that will grow with her!!!"
2,Kinda boring...,"I bought this game because I love the Little Mermaid and seeing Ariel on the box made me very happy. Sadly, there is not much Ariel in the game. The most you can do is put your princess model into Ariel scenes. I was hoping to put my model into Ariel's mermaid costume, but sadly, there are not many Ariel costume options (just the wedding dress and a pink one that she wears when she is human). All the costume are the classic 'ballgown' princess style, and most of them are ugly, as a matter of fact. I enjoyed putting my face onto these models, but I was disappointed that there were no costumes I really liked to put myself in. A waste of time; if buying this, like me, because you are a fan of Ariel, don't waste your money. Buy 'Ariel's Story Studio' or 'Little Mermaid 2 Activity Centre' instead."
5,So Much Fun!!,You can design your own costumes with different patterns and styles and wear them to the castle and search for more accessories and all sorts of unique items. You can even customize you characters appearance and even add your own face to the character. Then you can add your character to the storybook.
4,Disney's Princess Magical Dress up,"I purchased this game for my daughter, but because it had already been registered once I could not use the product. My husband was able to get into it some how for her to play it 1 time and she really liked it. but was very sad and upset when we could not get the opportunity to use it again. It was a total waste of my money. and apparently you can't buy it new now either it is outdated. Very disappointing."
2,"Not an EMT-I, but with this text I might (not) be!","For a variety of reasons I did not attempt to get my EMT-I certification; however I bought this book before that came about. The text is adequately written, and the layout is good for first time users. As emergency books go, I would recommend you pass, and see what your course instructor has assigned as a text."
3,Pretty good ... :),"Not great ? ... nope.First things first ... I used one of these guides for my very first trip to Europe in the 80's when really there was nothing else around for the budget traveller.Things are different now ... Lonely Planet and a gazillion other publications make Let's Go one choice among many - but it still has that 'poor student' backpacking mentality and for that it's still unique.My main gripe ? ... piss poor editing from one year to the next. Thanks to them I actually missed Tivoli Gardens in Denmark - they did not bother to check the actual dates running and we got there one weekend too late. It had just closed. Boo.Oh well ... still a good guide and for bargains, very good.(except not *everything* is teeming with seedy sensuality !)"
3,Just take what you need,"The maps in the book are ok for planning a little but pick up a map from the tourist office when you get in to you next city to actualy find your way around. The book is cheap enough that i didn't care what i did to it so i just cut out the cities i was visiting and brought the pages instead of the book. Good for lightening the load. The info was mostly accurate but some prices were out of date. Especialy transit and shuttle prices in a few places, but never more than a little change. I still think i prefer my lonely planet books."
1,Almost useless for travelling,"I used this book in Europe. Although I found a few good Internet cafes by using this book, finding historical places is often very difficult because there's no pictures of the buildings it refers to. Also, don't believe the prices stated for a lot of the places. It would make a world of difference, if its topics were supplemented by pictures to give a clearer understanding and find places a lot easier. The maps in this book are horrible. You can get lost by relying on them alone."
3,Back to his best,"This is a great improvement on his ""Gods & Generals"" which suffered in comparison to his father's ""Killer Angels"". Now he is writing at the same level as his father and this book makes a fitting conclusion to the Civil War trilogy. The sketch maps throughout are most useful in following the action."
4,"Not as good as Gods And Generals,","but worth reading. The first 5 or so chapters were kind of hard to follow, because it seemed as if Mr. Shaara was trying to hard to get into the minds of the main characters. Eventually, it seemed to flow easier and was rather enjoyable."
4,Last Full Measure,"If you are a history buff, you will love this book! It gives you the story from more than one character."
4,"Great story, great telling","If you liked Killer Angels, you'll enjoy this book, too. While I found the book's 570 pages a bit long, I also found myself dreading that the book would soon be over as I neared the end.I found the book to get better as it went along. It actually turns into a real page turner as the Feds are racing to cut off the Conferderates as they try to escape from Virginia at the end of the war. I found the author's account of Chamberlain to be especially interesting. Of course, we all know the end of the story, but it is enjoyable to read the accounts again."
4,Great Civil War fiction,"The conclusion to the father-son trilogy does not disappoint. ""The Last Full Measure"" follows the characters from the aftermath of Gettysburg through the end of their lives. The reader feels the desperation and hopelessness of the Confederate Army as it runs out of food and men, as well as the determination of Grant and Chamberlain. Overall, this book is a fitting capstone for the trilogy as it carries on the tradition of putting the reader on the battlefield in a way that's clear and meaningful."
3,"Good, but more winded than the others","Loved the other two by Jeff and his Dad. This book, although it moves well at most parts, seems to have that ""Stephen King Stall"" in a few places. Overall though it was very engaging and gives great closure on the trilogy."
4,Almost,"Jeff Shaara is not his father, but considering that fact, he did a good job in completing the trilogy. Any book about the Civil War's last days is sad, and Jeff Shaara has done the best fictional work on that time period. I think Killer Angels was more novel, which made it come alive better, and The Last Full Measure was more historic, with less fiction: some people like it better the more accurate it is, but to me Killer Angels really made it easier to understand the different characters' points of view. That does not mean that The Last Full Measure is not an exceptional book. I just can't think of it as a continuation of the matchless work Michael Shaara started."
3,"Author doesn't give his ""last full measure""; book suffers.","It appears that Jeff Shara did not give ""the last full measure"" to the writing of this book. His first effort, Gods and Generals, was well written. As one reads this last installment, you begin to get the feeling that he waded into a longer story than he intended to write. The final clash between Grant and Lee was very complex and a comprehensive retelling even in dramatic form would warrant two full novels. Instead, we get detailed accounts at the start and finish, with very a rapid and shallow recounting of events after the Wilderness leading up to Lee's evacuation of Petersburg, as if he had to hit an internal ""fast-forward search"" button. This attempt to remain comprehensive yet brief hampers the story. The narrative becomes choppy and disjointed. It remains a good read, but is not at the level of his first book."
3,The least of the three.,"The son's inferior writing abilities truly hinder this book. The characterization of Grant is weak, Lee starts to become a mystical figure. The battle descriptions are not as good. Only when the author covers the last campaign running to Appomattox does the book start to measure up to the first of his, but neither holds a candle to The Killer Angels and this one makes that painfully obvious."
4,Highly enjoyable for those interested in Civil War history.,"I found the Michael Shaara / Jeff Shaara trilogy very enjoyable and would highly recommend all three books to anyone interested in the period. I found the novel format to have much more impact in relating the human-emotion element of the Civil War, from both sides of the battle lines. I have always wondered at the conviction of soldiers that could march in file into the muzzles of rifles and cannons. I think these books have given me a better understanding of those soldiers and their time."
3,Worth reading to complete the series,"If you've read ""Killer Angels"" and ""Gods and Generals"", then read this book. After all, you've invested time and money on the series. Isn't it worth it to finish the series? If you haven't read either of the first two titles, then my advice is to read ""Killer Angels"" and forget about the two bookends by Jeff Shaara.Why? There are huge stylistic differences between Jeff and his deceased father. Killer Angels was a masterpiece. Jeff Shaara is to his father as Salieri is to Mozart.Unfair to compare father and son? Maybe. But when you propose to write a prequel and sequel to your father's finest work, you're inviting the comparison. Let's be honest here. If not for Michael Shaara's Killer Angels, nobody would ever have heard of Jeff Shaara."
3,Too drawn out...,"I did like this book and I did learn a lot about the Civil War. The last 100 pages are VERY slow and the reading did get tedious. All in all, I enjoyed the novel. I think, however, that ""Gods and Generals"" was better."
2,Got it Wrong,Among the Civil War generals you find the most overrated general in American history--Robert E Lee and the most underrated--U S Grant. And here Shaara falls into the same rut of idolizing Lee and dumbing down Grant. A great injustice has be done to Grant through large swaths of American history and Shaara ham-handed treatment of Grant in this novel is more of the same. For a fuller and more accurate portrayal of Grant (non-fiction) try Jean Edward Smith'sGrant.
1,The last full measure of mediocrity,I still cannot understand how this fellow should be allowed to cash in on the genius of his father. The Killer Angels is a masterpiece work. If this is the only way the son can make a living-by cashing in on the brilliance of his father to write these pale cut and paste forgeries-then God help us as readers who waste the twenty dollars. Why can't we cherish the great work as opposed to being subjected to the K-Mart selling of the TRILOGY. There is no trilogy. There is only the KILER ANGELS from this family.
3,I really wanted to love this book,"Although Jeff seems to have inherited his father's ability to accurately portray the agonies that the generals of the Civil War endured, his grammatical abilities interrupt the story. He is able to convey some of the emotion and momentum from The Killer Angels, but does not do nearly as good a job in describing battle.Further, his overwhelming use of ellipses to describe pauses in conversation may work in screenwriting, but they are tiresome in fiction. He also insists on stringing long clauses after single subjects in a way that begins as efficient, but later makes for labored reading."
4,"Exciting, Imagitive","I am a ten-year old, and I condemm Shaara for writing this extrodinary novel. I really like the way he uses such detail, but for a ten-year old, some things are a bit to . . . well let's just say to intense. But still, I think Jeff Shaara deserves a very good honor for writing this anominously liked book."
3,"Three Fourths of a Measure, at Least","This is the second of Jeff Shaara's books I have read. Even without a cover, I could spot his work anywhere. Jeff does tell a good story, especially his battle sequences. I have a bit of a problem with his style. I would forgive the occasional run-on sentence, but I think Jeff goes to the well far too often. His stacked phrasing can become destracting. Sometimes I catch myself counting commas instead of following the story line."
4,"Great, but many typos","I downloaded the Kindle version of this book. I'm enjoying it a great deal, but the number of typos is astounding. Do editors even exist anymore? The chapter ""Changing Their Mind"" is written as ""Changing Thier Mind."" Not kidding. There are also missing periods and commas throughout. Maybe this seems like a minor issue, but it's pretty glaring.Anyway, I enjoy the content of the book, so I'm still giving it 4 stars."
5,"Totally awesome, but not for the young","I love this pop-up book , but it is not one I would trust children with. This is one of my favorites that Robert Sabuda has done."
5,More Art than a book,My sons got this book along with The Jungle Book for Christmas. These books are works of art. They combine amazing pop-up art with a good story. My kids love these books. I plan to give away copies of Robert Sabuda and Matthew Reinhart's work to other folks in the future. Makes really memorable gifts.
5,Encyclopedia Prehistorica: Sharks and Other Sea Monsters,"Robert Sabuda always does a fantastic job and this is just another example of an exciting, educational pop-up book."
5,Amazing pop-up,The densest and most interesting pop-up book I've ever seen. Not for small fingers...
4,I love the shark!,"I bought this because my 3 year old loves to read ocean books, and I knew he would love the pop ups. The pop ups are very detailed and beautiful. I am happy with the book."
2,Concerning the Stuka portion of the DVD,"I was dissapointed by the Stuka portion of this DVD. Firstly, there were historical errors. For example, the Ju87B series aircraft did NOT have two machine guns in the rear gunner's position like the DVD stated. Secondly, the video clips used in this DVD were used multiple times throughout the DVD. Furthermore, a large portion of the clips had nothing to do with the Stuka at all and showed Ju52s, He111, and Bf109s instead. For the most part, the Stuka video on this DVD seems roughly and quickly patched together, with the most positive aspect of it being a few short clips of first-hand information from WWII Stuka pilot veterens. If you want an accurate picture of what the Stuka really was, find a good book on the subject instead."
4,A Kit Clayton #1 album,"The best thing about this album is that it's on Scape, which is Pole's label. And Pole are the original clickers and cutters. Scape has put out some amazing work, especially this and the Jan Jelenik album. People rave about Burnt Friedman, and sure, it's good stuff, but this and Jelenik are not talked about enough.Let's talk about Kit Clayton more at parties.This album is glorious. It is similar to Vladislav Delay, full of dub niceness, and slow pitch cuts and clicks. The quality is very dry, like a wine or something. Crisp. There are details on this album that are like expensive things I can only imagine owning.It might be Clayton's best work. I expect that Vladislav Delay gets all the hype, for his album Anima. But Anima is not as good as this.I listen to Clayton while I read the new James Kelman, Translated Accounts, the IDM of novels (how cruel to say, but it's a good book, and it is quite different and advanced in terms of its language)."
2,great but outdated british book,"I cancelled my order as soon as I visited the Cambridge University Press website, & looked more closely at the content of this book. Although it appears to be a great, extremely helpful book, being based on the chief, presenting complaint, the problem is twofold for American users. First, it uses American Heart Assoc. 2000 guidelines, not 2005, despite being published in 2005, and the AHA guidelines have changed significantly. Second, the book uses British units of measurement (for ex, cm of water, rather than mmHg for blood pressure). This book would be wonderful, a blessing, if it were up to date with current AHA 2005 guidelines & written for U.S. users. You can probably still gain value from it, but should be very familiar with American standards of measurement & current AHA guidelines before reading it, so you can read with discernment."
5,Strong Work,"I have found this work an excellent introduction to emergency medicine, and should be first reading for any new student interested in Emergency Medicine. Dr. Madhaddevan and Dr. Garmel should be applauded for this work. Strong work Gus and Maha."
5,Great for EM students,"As a fourth year med student interested in EM, this is a great text. You can't finish it over one rotation at over 700 pages. But if you're taking 2-3 rotations with externships, this is a great text plod through.I'm only about halfway through, but I like to read a chapter and then review the material in Secrets or Pocket Emergency Medicine, sometimes adding to the latter (in VERY small print) from the great material in this book."
4,Golden Age of EBM,"Gone are the days when EBM is this sparse, and yet still solid, dark, and hard. The arrangments primarily consist of drums, bass, one sequence, one lead line, and vocals.NitzerEbb also show that a ""pop"" song can be beefed up to EBM status. All these songs are memorable, and have lasted the test of time. Highlights include Captivate, Hearts And Minds, and Control...I'm Here.Clearly alot of todays contempary bands/artists have this CD in their collections."
1,terrible terrible writing,"There are so many typos in this book; very unprofessional. A writer should know the difference between ""there"" and ""their""! It is filled with short, choppy, unnecessary sentences and also amateur run-ons. It seems as though it's written by a middle schooler envisioning what a relationship would be like. I tried to ignore the details and read to find some good in the book, but I couldn't even get through more than a few chapters...I would like my money back."
2,No Time for Julian Barbour,"I would tell you what I thought of the book. But since the author's point is that time does not exist, how could I have been expected to have the time to read this book. And pulleaze don't tell me that I could have assembled a whole bunch of consecutive moments because I swear, no pun intended, I will clock you!Like I say, no time to read it."
2,Disappointed,"I read this after reading Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe and was hoping to get more ideas about how recent physicists view time. I found this book much less clear, much less informative, and it seems to represent a minority view among physicists as it largely ignores recent work on string theory. I give it two stars only because I gave up after about five chapters and may have missed something of value."
2,Science Fiction Not Science,"I found this book rambling, difficult to understand, and not particularly well written. The main thesis that all that exists is NOW (see the other reviews for more detail) was not proven in the book and, as far as I can see, cannot be proven empirically (mathematical proof without experimental proof is not adequate). In my opinion this book's theories belong to the realm of science fiction. If you want to let your imagination roam, anything is possible. Maybe everything is an illusion. Maybe I am the only thing that exists in the universe. Maybe there are all sorts of simultaneous universes that are constantly breaking in on each other. Etcetera. If I tried hard enough, I could probably support each of these ideas with concepts from quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity.I don't think it's unusual for theoretical physics to cross the line from science to conjecture: This book is in that tradition."
2,It would have been a great book.,Bummer presentation with no pedagogical structure/path. Just not presented well. But a very unique and riveting hypothesis...
1,Parmenides and Zeno resurrected,"I am always looking for a physics book that will enable me to evolve my perception of reality. This is not one of those books. Mr. Barbour makes an unconvincing attempt to convince the reader that a priori concepts such as causality and time are just an illusion. In the preface he states that he knows that most of the readers will not be able to finish the book, but if you read it to the end then all will be made clear. After suffering through the first 5 chapters, I skipped to the end and was convinced that he is wrong, and that time and causality are not an illusion."
1,Don't Buy It!,"I read a variety of books on Physics, Astronomy and other topics. This book is rambling, and poorly written. There should be something a reader can take away from a book but this book has little real content. I hung on to the end to find out what the bottom line would yield. It wasn't worth it. I tossed it in the trash as soon as I finished."
1,This book goes into the recycling bin.,"Shame to Julian Barbour for publishing a book that has ""physics"" in the title, but not one single equation! Where are the new ideas? Not in this book, for sure. Save your money!"
2,Too revolutionary!,I didn't like it because I didn't understand it. If I ever get a significant IQ boost I'll try a re-read.
2,"Confusing the beginner, dissapointing the specialist","I would like to know in person Julian Barbour. His narrative is very good, and he definetively motivates the interested reader. However, my impression is that he took good care of the first chapters of ""The end of time"", whereas the last part of the book dedicated to quantum gravity and DeWitt equation was written quite fast and without care.The beginner get confused. And if you are a physicist, or engineer with some knowledge of modern physics, you cannot grasp the essence. It is too qualitative.It would be interesting if any of these guys that claim to understand relativity and field theory target a book to a regular exact science professional.Nevertheless, I recommend the book to the reader interested in physics; it is motivating."
2,Put on your thinking cap.,"The newspaper reviews led me to buy this book. It is far beyond my novice capability to comprehend. I think four years of college is not quite enough education to grasp this theory. Not a ""Physics for Dummies"" type of book."
1,Time itself was never so convoluted,"This book was one of the worst I have ever read in my life. It's lack of coherent structure and awkward style unnecessarily complicate and frustrate a potentially profound and already-difficult topic.No matter, however, for in the end, there is no real conclusion that is arrived at anyway: the roundabout path has led nowhere and Time stands nonplussed."
2,It all sounds the same,"He's got potential, but all his material sounds the same. Most of his stuff sounds like a take off of Melissa Etheridge's ""Come To My Window"" or ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"". He's a great actor, but a so-so musician. He needs more ""hooks"", more diversity, give me something that really rocks, along with the ballads."
1,Don't waste your money......,"Oh my... this had to be the worst purchase I have ever made.I met Bradley and found out he was an actor and musician.I thought I would buy a CD to see what he sounded like.What a waste of money and what a waste of breath for him.It's not my style of music but it even made my Mom, Boss,and Sister cringe. I haven't seen any acting of hisbut I sure hope it's better than his singing. Absolutely dreadful times 10!!"
4,good for its size,These are good speakers if you are looking for something small. They are a little bassy at higher volumes.
3,"Moody Blues ""Lovely to not see you again""",I'm sorry folks but I love the Moody Blues and have all their music and their DVDs. This show is an indicator that its time I think to retire with some dignity here. Sound quality is good and Video is supurb but the voices are so weak.
4,Still kickin' it,"Another very good performance from a legendary group. Even without one of the original members this dvd is definitly worth the money. Crisp, clean, and clear like always the band just keeps on kickin' it."
3,Could be better,"I've been a fan of the Moody's for longer than I care to admit and I seen them play at the Greek before. I disappointed with the quality and mix of the tracks on this CD. Yes, I know a live album is different than a studio album, but this was recorded just a few years ago, not a re-mix of old 70's live tapes. It should be better."
2,"Not So Lovely To Hear You, Again","I'm a big fan of the Moody Blues and have been since 1972. That being said I was let down with this BluRay. No complaints with video and audio, which were great. As good as, or better, than the 1992 performance, ""A Night at Red Rocks"".However, the vocals were heart breaking. They just didn't perform with the range or dynamics they had even just a few years younger; and that was back in 2005. Based on this performance, I wouldn't bother listening to any performance after 2000."
5,The Moody Blu's!!! The best seat in the house for less than the price of one concert ticket!!!,"This is a great blu ray disc!!! Like having your very own Moodies concert in you own living room, It's just like being there at The Greek Theatre in Los Angeles!!!a great 20 song concert,with a nice interview with the boys in the band as a bonus!!! Much cheaper than even one convert ticket!!! Very recommended!!! A+"
5,Moody Blues: Lovely to See You (2005),"This is a very good DVD disc. I am actually a big fan. They play and sing wonderfully and show that they enjoy playing live, you can just see how good time they are having them selves and the audience and that is a part of their charm."
2,Uninspired,"I grew up listening to the MB's a lot. Some of their stuff was uniquely creative and inspiring. So it was with great anticipation that I opened up this DVD.From reviews, I thought the absence of the orchestra in this would be fine, but I find the concert missing elements - it seems hollow and relatively uninspired. There just isn't energy here. Too bad, because the material - the original songs - are truly great. They could take you places, but the original tracks are better than this concert.There are maybe 2 dozen 'must-have-in-library' DVD concerts out there (Diana Krall, live in Paris, Pink Floyd, Pulse, U2, Vertigo, Norah Jones, Live in New Orleans, Peter Gabrielle, Secret World Live, Bela Fleck, Live at the Quick, just to name an eclectic few that are special)- this is not one of them unfortunately. Worth renting though!"
5,Moody Blues Circa 2005 An Absolute Timeless Treasure for the Ages!,"This current line-up puts on an exciting and energetic performance that the past band memebers would certainly be proud of. Funny how times change and some things just stay the same.Forty years later its as refreshing as the first day you heard it... Who'd a thunk?To the reviewers who are not so positive, I hear theres a new internet radio station for you... three weeks of moody blues and one week of rag time, you should definately check it out."
1,Good performance; bad filming,"This is the kind of filming made by amateurs or people who do not know anything about music. The Moody Blues (without founding members Mike Pinder and Ray Thomas) perform all their great songs in a 2005 show. The problem is elsewhere: without any purpose, the camera is moving almost all the time and can not concentrate on a single thing. The editing is excessive as well: each shot last just about five seconds (see for instance the intro for ""Isn't life strange?"", with about ten shots from various angles only for the opening flute solo). It is impossible to concentrate on a singer or a chord progression. I can not imagine a worst scenario for such a good performance spoiled by too much technique and useless visual effects. Undoubtly a very good performance by the Moodies; but a very bad filming creates a mess."
4,Still Going Strong,"I've been a Moody Blues fan since the late '60s and have seen them in person three times. This is the first video I've seen without Ray Thomas and I was all set to be disappointed, but the woman flutist is outstanding.This DVD hasn't got the symphonic sounds of the ""Red Rocks"" DVD, but there are many more of their newer songs featured. In addition, this is the first DVD of a concert where I've actually watched the ""Interview with the band"" segment and it is great. These are genuine people who love making great music and who, I believe, truly appreciate their fans. You do get some insight into their personal lives and it's nice to see how ""well-grounded"" they are, unlike some of today's ""talent pool"", most of whom will never last 40 years."
5,Great companion to the DVD.,"I loved the DVD purchased earlier and desired to hear this music in my car, as well. Great music, great quality."
5,great,what a great video all there greatest hits and Norda is a great edition to the band hope she stays with them for another tour
1,Was not able to review because can not access the DVD,Please let customers know that this HD/DVD can only be played on specific media. I need to send this back for an exchange...thanks
1,"It has been 5 weeks since it was supposedly shipped, and I still have not received it!","I would love to share my thoughts about the Moody Blues dvd, but I have waited 5 weeks and it still has not arrived. This is the first time I have had trouble with an Amazon purchase with a vendor."
1,WHAT THE DUECE?!,"I am a fan of these people and their music for almost 40 years. This is one of the most horribly produced cd's I've ever heard. The sound quality and production is akin to someone getting the approval to market their own recording that was made with a cheap cassette recorder. Whomever mastered this recording did a really, really poor job. The box is nice though. No justice was done to this group."
4,Moody Blues in the right mode,The best Music DVD I have seen for this Classic Group. Up Close and Personal in High Def Sound and Video. Justin Haywood in Fine form. If you have HD DVD this is a must for your Music Video Collection.
5,Classic Moody Blues,"Lovely to see you is a great live recording of the Moody Blues. The album seems different without the orchestra, but the vocals were great."
1,Moody Blues Review,"As much as I love the Moody Blues, this DVD was disappointing ...performance seemed as if they were bored or exhausted..friends watching with me felt same"
3,their best DVD ever....but still not that good of a show...,"I am a huge Moody Blues fan....and therefore I've owned every DVD release they have put out. This is by far the best effort on DVD they have ever released. I am disappointed they didn't bother to incorporate some orchestral backing on a couple of their bigger oldies....Justin Hayward's singing still lacks passion as in every other live show I've watched him perform...he appears as though he is just singing the routine tracks for the fans out there....collecting his paycheck and going on to the next venue.The sound quality is much better on this DVD than any of their previous concerts, however it still lacks the clearity that I found watching ELO's latest DVD release.All in all...a decent version of one of their live events....but not the overblown masterpiece some of the reviewers make this DVD out to be!I'm just keeping it honest here....if you love the Moody Blues...you are going to enjoy this new DVD release."
3,good but not the same with ray thomas,"this dvd was a lengthy concert with many songs played, particularly when compared with live at prince albert hall, but i thought the musical arrangement was lacking. The quality of the music was not clear enough, and without the benefit of a whole orchestra behind them, this dvd lacked pizazz i thought. Also, I thought the singers voices were a bit horse, and they seemed a little like they were going through the motions at times. Norda Mullen the new floutist to substitute for retired bandmember ray thomas gave it her all, but all the band members were in casual wear but she was wearing this evening gown which just seemed so out of place as she jumped around on the stage with the flute or tamborine in a strapless black gown with high heels. Just didnt fit in. but it didnt impact the quality of the music she was responsible for."
4,A great time,We had a wonderful time watching the DVD. It never fails to remind you that truly great bands survive the aging process. The baby boomers know how to enjoy their music. You will see some of them dancing in the aisles or on the seats. The music is grand and the Greek Theater is a perfect place to relive your youth.
3,Concert Great* Seller delivered broken product,"I very much enjoyed the tracks that worked, but the DVD was defective. I cannot view 3 of the performances."
1,Barely appealing,"Same-old-same-old recycled fare with a few additions. Just what the Moodies need, another compilation piece. Yawn. The only worthwhile offerings included 'Higher & Higher' with an energetic Graeme, whom I haven't seen move about like that since the 60's, plus the bonus interview of the three remaining members, sans make-up. As far as the quality of the shooting, it was high school direction and photography at best. Most footage was sloppy and 95% of it was of Justin. First time Justin appeared the least bit interested in his performance (as he has for the past twenty or so years looked like he was just punching a proverbial clock with a let's-move-on-to-the-next-venue-and-get-that-over-with-as-well attitude) while John seemed bored. As a loyal, die-hard fan of 40 years it brings me no comfort to enter this harsh criticism. This is the one time that I can say without hesitation, the guys are no longer aging like fine wine."
1,Totally bad,"My wife loves music videos and we have a collection, however, the sound quality on this dvd is not worth listening to!Don't bother with this one....."
1,Could not play this..!,"Unfortunately this bluray disk would not play for Me. Thank's to Amazon for allowing Me to return it.Because I have not seen it, can't give any stars...! But Amazon forces Me to give ONE STAR..!!!"
5,Superb .........,"I didn't realize how astonishingly talented these guys were and I grew up listening to them. After watching this on a tv special at only one hour I bought this dvd and watched the whole performance. They are talented beyond belief, writing all their own music, being themselves all these decades and certainly in a category few occupy these days. No wonder people still relate to their music. I'm sorry I didn't pay more attention and appreciate them before now. But I'm so glad I bought this dvd and it's very obvious from the audience reaction that this group hasn't lost their magic ---- they are still great. Wish I could see them in person and up close. Maybe one day I will."
4,"good enough, worth the price","These are replacement paper filter bags for a vacume cleaner used to clean computers, printers and copiers. Since laser toner and printer toner can be hazardous to breathe, it is important that the dust is collected and not allowed to float around.These bags are not quite as good as the original that came with the vacume, but they are good enough for our situation. They are certainly a good value for the price, so I would buy them again."
1,Not the correct bags,I ordered these bags for the VM-6BS500 vacuum. They are NOT the correct bags. These particular bags are 6x6. The bags that SHOULD be advertised and that fit subject vacuum are the 4x4. Someone needs to correct this!
1,Metro Bags,"I should have listened to the other reviews that said these bags are to small. I ordered them anyway and they were right, the bags are way to small."
3,Data Vac - Suction isn't that great,"Yes, I would recommend, but the suction is a little weak. It is worth the price. Try it and see if it works for you."
1,Pete,Brought a Metro Duster and this was advertise as needed with the duster. WRONG not needed ! A waste of money !!! Got a duster not a vacuum cleaner. Trash soon.
2,"Good reviews, bad performance, much regret","I read the reviews and thought this vacuum cleaner would be a convenient, powerful tool. It doesn't even pick up the dust and dirt from the carpet in the car, much less in the corners and crevices of a house. If i could return it, I would."
2,Nice to have them back but ...,"Nice to have the wacky racers back, all the 34 episodes in one DVD. Nonetheless one comment : on the back cover it states that this DVD is ""standard version presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of their original television exhibition"" I'm not that sure as after viewing the entire dvd all the cartoons seem to have been trimmed a bit on each sides of the screen. This is very unnerving for a ""collector edition"", so much for quality..."
3,Wacky Races Review,"The Animation was pretty good for that era. The races are fun to watch and had a lot of Tom & Jerry like slapstick. The only thing wrong with the show is that Dick Dastardly ALWAYS lose. I know he cheats but still,he has to win once in a while. I think that's one of the main reasons why this show only lasted one season. The Predictable Dick-always-losing ending. At least on Yogi's Space Race,the villain from that show won even if it was only 2 times. The other thing wrong with the show is that it's also riddled with stereotypes like Penelope Pitstop(The Southern Belle),Luke Bear(The Hillbilly),The Ant Hill Mob(1940's Mobsters),Sgt.Blast(Loadmouth Sgt),Pri.Meekly(weak & scared private) and last but not least Peter Pefect(The Proud Showoff). Overall despite it's flaws,it's still a pretty good for kids to watch. I give this series a 6 out of 10."
4,Great! Is Penelope Pitstop coming next?,"""The Wacky Races"" was my first favorite cartoon as a child. I anticipate getting a chuckle out of this collection, but what I would LOVE to see is ""The Perils of Penelope Pitstop"" on DVD! Both are cult classic Hanna-Barbera non sequiturs, like nothing they had done before or since. These eclectic toons seemed to almost give up on the idea of narrative altogether and just relied on bizarre design and great voice work by the likes of Paul Winchell, Paul Lynde, and Mel Blanc at their best. Pockets, get out the DVD player!"
5,Wacky Entertainment,The Wacky Races are an excellent series of vintage cartoons from Hanna Barbera that feature fun and quirky characters that compete in races throughout the country. The zany plots of Dick Dastardly and Muttley to try to cheat and win each race provide interesting twists and turns in each episode. I highly recommend this DVD for highly entertaining and fun viewing for the whole family.
4,What a buzz....,"As the intro starts, it brings back all those memories. Penelope Pitstop ( did anybody else notice she dials - hair, but the robot does her lips) Peter Perfect, the Professor and others start the next wacky race. There are 34 episodes ( it always seemed to go longer on TV) on the 3 discs + plus some extras.As much as watching the DVD, being able to reminisce about times spent watching on TV. A great trivia question is to get the friends to remember the names and numbers.My two boys ( six and four) have taken to watching them, with us choosing who will be the winner ( however my suspicion is that they have been fastforwarding the episodes to find out who wins - before we watch them :-))Just further proof for the boys ( and me) that good animation doesn't have to involve people turning into monsters, using magic or violence to be entertaining.I still cheer for the 00"
2,Wacky Races,Very repetitive as every episode is a slightly different theme for racing. Not my favourite. Great quality though
5,Way out Wacky Races,"Wacky Races is still the greatest cartoon ever released and now that it is available on DVD it now lives on forever as a classic toon!! Such lines as from Dick Dastardly ""Drats and Double Drats"" and Muttley's snickering to the Convert-O-car of Pat Pending and the pristine Penelope Pitstop, Peter Perfect etc. are relived on this 3DVD set. Get yourself a copy, highly recommended, and you too will become a wayout Wacky racer!!"
4,Interesting Bit of Trivia...,"If you assign 3 points for the winner of each race, 2 points for the 2nd place finisher, and 1 point for the 3rd place finisher, the all-time Wacky Races Champs are the Slag Brothers."
3,Fond Memories of this Classic Cartoon,"I loved this show as a kid. Something about all those characters, all those cars, and the slapstick humor of it kept me coming back for more. I was very excited to hear this classic show was coming to DVD as a complete series set. Yes, the animation is more in line with the Hanna-Barbera output for TV from the 50's and 60's, but that's the time it was made. And, yes, the film could have been cleaned up a bit better (the colors are nice, but you see the occasional scratch and such go by). One the flip side, the extras are very cool - both the look back at the series and a look at the spin-offs (both which I hope make DVD too).Recommended for older fans and young kids."
4,Good old clean fun,Kids at our youth meeting love watching snips from this series before we start the evening program
2,The same thing over and over again....,"They go to a new location, race, a few win, they move on.Warning; The episodes have been edited for DVD release and some of the music cues and narration have been either altered or deleted all together."
3,"happy,but sad",i bought the series thinking they would show the entire series including the break between episodes when every1 is tuning up their cars 2 prepare 4 the next race. the biggest disappointment was that they didn't put in dave willock's end piece @ the end of the show.
1,Flimsy Product,"After mounting this Post Lantern, it is so floppy it will sway in a breeze. I had to modify it to get it to stay rigidly upright. Do not buy this product. The shame is there is not a brass lantern of this size that is of good quality."
4,Note:,"There are TWO editions of Volume 4 of Kyo Kara Maou. Please note that this version is the single edition, and does NOT come with the Art Box."
4,Interesting Narrative,This book may have been written a long time ago but much of its principles still hold true today. His narrative is quite different from what you would normally expect (first person POV) but it makes for a fascinating read. I highly recommend it for ANYONE in game design.
3,Not too bad,"The pictures often have nothing to do with the positions/descriptions they are near. The layout was more distracting than anything. Descriptions and quantity of positions are pretty good, though."
5,Simply the best,This is the best Rocky movie ever.You can really relate to the human side ofRocky and not Rocky the superstar.Stalone did a great job shooting this movie.
3,Dignified finale,"Although the news of Rocky's return was good for some laughs at first, I have to admit Sylvester Stallone managed to create a dignified finale for his boxing alter ego. Eventhough we have seen the same movie 6 times by now, Rocky Balboa's strength of being the underdog in every fight still works. Too bad part 5 of the Rocky series cannot be erased from everybody's minds forever. Rocky Balboa should have been part 5.(SARR)"
2,Should hold you off till Rocky 7,"Having never seen any of the Rocky movies before this film, I can rate this movie objectively.Obviously, story is rare in extreme sport movies, boxing, football, and the like; let alone in third sequels - this is to be expected. Rocky Balboa doesn't even attempt to draw us in the story, and I'm glad for it. Story or not; the movie has roughly five characters, your typical moral comeupance, and paints a good picture of a boxer's prime in the aftermath. The first half an hour has Rocky walking around saying ""hi"" and signing autographs to random people, the second act has Rocky eyeing a cute girl and her son, and the last half has some of the cheesiest boxing sequences availabe via camera.The movie is not an aim for success, but another in a big trilogy to bring us into Rocky's interesting world and I respect the film for it. However, if you've seen the trailer, you've pretty much seen Rocky Balboa in it's entirety."
4,Thankfully a Lot Like the First One,"I liked the feel of this one from the very start. It is at times openly repeating Rocky I, which lends this movie it's progenitor's integrity, while still throwing in homages to the later movies without being tainted by their cheaper hooks. It's an emotional walk down memory lane with Rocky that quickly culminates in one bone-crushing fight.Stallone deserves credit for bringing this character to us, and this movie showcases all his talents (he wrote, directed, and starred in it) richly.No surprises in this one, but if you like the best the Rocky series has to offer, this film offers the chance to experience it again."
5,"Good message, safe to watch","Rocky Balboa is a good movie with a good message and is safe to watch (free of nudity and sex scenes, plus violence is reduced to the sport)"
3,Win by losing?,"This movie is about 'heart'; to take it and still fight back.Boxing is a bad metaphor for it as the current legalsituation is a financially mediated joke with three recognized champions.Most people have turned to things like kung fu, karate or kick boxing:even women's boxing has more draw than a fixed or fixated heavy weightfight. So why do we still see the hopes of the fighters assomething we will watch? Am I spoiling it by saying Rocky loses?But he also delivers his message of heart and courage one more time.I can't give it more than three stars because itis the same old same old...with a new younger woman for love interest."
4,The Comeback Kid,"One of the biggest surprises in recent cinema, ""Rocky Balboa"" recaptures the heart and spirit of the 1976 Oscar winner. The 16-year hiatus adds graceful poignancy to the aging Philly underdog - a quality lacking in the previous sequels. Sylvester Stallone delivers an affecting performance as the iconic boxer who defies skepticism by taking on the current heavyweight champion (Antonio Tarver) in a Vegas exhibition match. As writer-director, Stallone bounces back from the pitfalls of sequelitis by making a detailed character study that gives his famous creation a stirring finale. Against all odds, ""Rocky Balboa"" emerges as a minor triumph."
5,"If you loved the original, then SEE THIS FILM!","This will be short: This film is only one micro-millimeter away from being just as good as the original ""Rocky"". It is poignant, well-written, very well acted, and, if you'll forgive the boxing terminology, it packs quite a punch.Folks, when I first heard that Stallone was doing yet another ""Rocky"" sequel, my first response was, ""He's GOT to be kidding, right???"" I just couldn't believe it, and I thought that it was a sure sign that Stallone's career really was over. I was certainly sad to think that, because I've always been a big fan.This is one of those very rare occasions that I was well and truly wrong about something. This is a very good film, and deserves to be given credit as being what it is: The best of the ""Rocky"" sequels. Stallone's writing and acting, as well as his direction of this film, haven't been this good in some time.If you loved the original ""Rocky"", and you haven't already done so, SEE THIS FILM!You'll thank me later."
3,pretty good closure,This is a movie you can sit back and watch and appreciate the series and finally have closure. Good Effort by stallone But really not award winning acting either. My fiancee watch this movie (and this being her first rocky film that she has watched) enjoyed it.
4,Elegy: Good to see Rocky Balboa one Last Time,"ROCKY BALBOA is a bit of an endearing film. It was good to see Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa, Burt Young as Paulie and Tony Burton as Duke (Rocky and Apollo Creed's trainer). Rocky had to give it one last shot and get it out of his system. It was well worth the elegiac journey. Rocky's fight scene in this Blu-ray edition should look fantastic since that sequence was shot with digital cameras."
5,"""Sly's Great Rocky Finale!""","Sylvester Stallone directs and stars in this 2006 drama.Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa returns to the ring to fighta young heavyweight champion. Sly did a great job andhe proved that even at 60, Rocky could still get backin the ring one last time. This dvd has nice pictureand sound plus cool extras. I recommend this."
4,Great Movie and Good Blu-ray transfer!,"This is a preview of the Blu-ray version. I can tell you that the picture brightness is amazing on this DVD even on 101"" projected image. Colors are nice with a little blue tint. The only issue I have is the high level of graininess of this DVD especially with night and indoor scenes (big part of the movie). There are many extras and many are shot in HD. In fact some of the extras displays a more perfect Blu-ray picture than the film itself. The Movie is great and very realistic. Sylvester Stallone at his very best, but he appear much older in this movie. Again Great Movie, Great extras, Good Transfer, but for $27 the high level of picture grains really bothers me."
4,Well done Sylvester,"Having watched the actual movie in a cinema I was more than pleased to purchase the DVD. I purchased the DVD to ""go back"" and enjoy specific sections of the movie. Especially where Stallone talks with his son about ""expectations"". A VERY insightful piece of forthright frankness that ALL persons should watch and especially listen too. My only problem was that the DVD took three times the estimated time for arrival from the supplier - NOT GOOD and must be remedied to save your customers"
3,Suprisingly Good Rocky Movie,"While it's completely unrealistic that a 60-something ex-champ could fight competitively with a 20-something current champ, Rocky Balboa turns out to be quite a good movie. Rocky is back in his old hard scrabble neighborhood dealing with the facts of aging, the death of his beloved wife, and his estrangement from his son. When a computer generated match between Rocky and current champ Mason Dixon touts that Rocky was the better boxer, Dixon's management stages an exhibition match between the two boxers. Rocky accepts despite some thinking his crazy to do so.Rocky Balboa is true to the original movie and evokes a lot of nostalgia. The writers did an outstanding job of living up to the theme of the original Rocky - the underdog who through heart and courage exceeds expectations. It is a fitting end to the Rocky saga and a surprisingly enjoyable movie given the silliness of last few Rocky movies."
3,Rocky,"Here he is again!Rocky Balboa is getting back in the ring. One might think he is too old and too slow , but he is going to try it anyway. Sylvester Stallone is back in his sixth Rocky movie."
2,Big Rocky Fan,"I Own and repeatedly watch the entire Rocky set. The only movies I repeat watch... Even named my boxer dog ""Rocky"" as a tribute to this set. I couldnt wait for this last episode to be available....I wont share the details cause if you're like me you are gonna buy it anyway. If for no other reason than to complete your set. So you can just check it out too....Having said that, I find myself thinking if this is the best Sly was going to do, I would rather he just left the set as it was, without this movie. This movie seems to be thrown together just to say it was done. I only gave it two stars for the great previous efforts. On its own, this one deserves to be ""Minus 4.5 Stars""."
3,It's Over,This is so depressing. This has to be the last of the Rocky movies...Stallone is just too old to be playing this character after all these years. The most excitement is him back in the ring for a fight.Stallone needs to move on to other things...Rocky is done!!!
4,"dubmest rocky ever ""NOT!!!!!!!!!!!"" way better than V","better than rocky V, 3 i sitll liked the one in russia but again this was one of the better ones"
4,Stallone delivers,"When I first heard about this my reaction was to groan. Having seen ROCKY BALBOA I have to admit my fears weren't justified. This is a very entertaining film that bring the Rocky saga to a satisfactory conclusion -- far better than ROCKY V 16 years earlier. His son is an adult, Adrian has died and become a therapist to Geico cavemen, and Rocky finds himself drawn into another improbable contest. Still, the formula still works."
4,Fun Follow-Up,My 7 yr old LOVES the Rocky films and was very pleased with this one. Looks like it will be a constant order for us in the future!
4,Real (?),"It seems odd to write this, but one of the best things about this movie is the acting. I thought Stallone was amazing. The lines are great. The script is very, very good. That courtroom scene where Rocky argues for ""the pursuit of happiness"" and following one's dream, is to me one of the best statements I have ever seen in a movie, about what America is about and should be about (being able to pursue one's dream, and why should some arbitrary bureaucrat take that away ?).The boxing is amazing. I felt like I was watching a real fight.It seems odd to even write this, but I thought the film not only had good acting, but I loved the script and I loved the fight itself."
3,Rocky Balboa,"If you are a true fan, you need to see this movie.The movie itself is not the greatest ever, but if you are a follower of the Rocky series you will need to see this episode if for nothing else than closure.Without giving away the movie, it actually kind of sets the clock back to zero as if nothing ever happened. From underdog to champion and back again, this actually felt like the real final chapter.Don't get me wrong, nothing is lost. Rocky has been a big influence in my life since day one. You can do whatever you set your mind to. ""It's not about how well you can hit. It's all about how well you can take a hit."""
4,A great farewell to the Rocky saga,"I grew up watching Rocky movies on TV. I really liked all of them, except the fifth movie. To me, that movie was always a bad way to end the great Rocky saga. Thankfully, this movie was made, and it brings a lot of heart with it. The movie was emotional, and without spoiling too much, gave a decent conclusion to the character we all love. Thumbs up!"
3,Rocky Balboa,Ok conclusion to the Rocky series. In this film after a computer prediction that Rocky would beat existing champion Mason the Line Dixon if there were to fight at their peak) Rocky decides to fight again. He trains for a 10 Round exhibition fight with the champ. The film is ok and is more like the first two films than the other ones. The ending is predictable but still inspiring.
4,A little goodbye from an American icon,"Rocky is back in his 6th and final film. The first half of the film moves a bit slow as the audience is updated on Rocky's life since we last saw him 16 years ago. The most obvious change is the absense of Adrian (Rocky's wife), who has passed away. An emotionally damaged Rocky revisits the past, hoping to fill the void (of Adrian) in his heart. This eventually leads him back to his passion of boxing, which serves as the ultimate symbol of his determination.So how does Rocky get back into the ring (for a title shot) at 59 years old? Well, it's the same old Rocky premise: Current champ is seen as a fake by the public and fights Rocky in hopes of gaining the respect he thinks he deserves. However, it's a premise that works and true Rocky fans embrace time and again. Sure, I wasn't completely happy with the ending, and at times Rocky gets carried away with his moronic one liners. But, Stallone delivered what he promised: a sweet goodbye from an old friend"
3,"Decent, nothing new here","Truthfully I was expecting more. More boxing, more action, more something. It was kind of boring and was quickly sold at auction."
4,The Best Since the First Rocky,"I enjoyed this one a lot. Stallone returns to his humble roots and tells a satisfying story to bring the saga to its final conclusion. This is Sly's finest acting next to Cop Land, First Blood, and the original Rocky. I hope he continues to write and direct more projects of this nature. I am looking forward to his Edgar Allen Poe biopic."
3,"Hello, old friend...sort of.","Well, compared to the tragedy that was ROCKY IV and V, ROCKY BALBOA plays like an Oscar winner all over again! But I suppose ""all over again"" are the key words here.When watching ROCKY BALBOA, you can't help but enjoy it as a guilty pleasure because it reminds you so much of the original ROCKY of 1976, with all of its heart, soul and drama. But the fact is, is that when it's over, you've only been reminded and taken back to the spirit of the original film ""all over again"". If that's all the sixth installment of this franchise has to offer, then you're better off watching the original best picture of 1976 all over again; it was the best film in the series and it always will be."
5,Solid and Reliable Introduction to Ethnicity and Religion in Contemporary China,"Gladney's Dislocating China is an excellent introduction into the ways in which ethnicity and religion intersect in contemporary China today. Although many of the chapters deal with China's Muslims the book as a whole is more wide ranging examining ethnic representation in Chinese cinema, ethnic 'culture parks' and in popular culture. One of the central themes of the book is Gladney's contestation of ""Han"" as a legitimate ethnic group. The book while theoretical is highly readable and a good introduction for anyone who wants to grapple intellectually with the People's Republic of China's policies towards its Muslim population."
2,"elegantly condensed, not practical","Physics major from Purdue U.Author fails to have enough examples worked out as well as solutions to exorcises. Without feedback from the book, one is required to waste a great deal of time confiming solutions.A detailed solution guide would complete this text, if one existed! I encourage anyone to write one."
3,Advanced,"I took a course in Analytical Mechanics my junior year and I found this book to be very advanced. If you touch up on your linear algebra, differential equations, and know a few tricks with Taylor series expansions and a few trig identitities, you should be armed with a decent arsenal for the exercises in this book. Exercises take a lot of time and energy, and examples provide little help. There are also supplementary sections which solve problems using Mathcad and Mathematica. These are helpful, but only if you've used the software before. The text wastes no time in teaching you syntax. Be prepared to expend extra energy re-reading sections of this book. It sometimes lacks clarity."
4,This book is a highly technical look at mechanics,This book is being used at the University of Wisconsin Platteville currently for the Applied Mechanics class. Strong foundations in Calculus and Differential equations are needed to understand the material covered. The questions are very difficult and little answer are given
3,rarely to be heard works,"This CD covers some rarely performed works. I bought it after a concert by the Swiss Carmina Quartett who performed the Quartetto Dorico. Their performance was definitely superior to the one recorded here, but you can live with this one quite well if you can put up with a quasi-orchestral sound. Complete your record collection with this work if you like such works as the string quartets by Gian Francesco Malipiero or Ildebrando Pizzetti. Until quite recently, this was the only CD available that had the Quartetto Dorico, which is quite surprising because this is an interesting, easy-to-understand and impressive work."
4,Don't hate the player,The thing that I like about the movie is that I like the music that jimmy Cliff. The other thing that I like of the movie is that Jimmy began to do drugs and he began to sell the drugs to get money.The thing that I didn't like about the movie was that it didn't have a lot of action. It didn't have good girls in the movie.
3,Price,Who is responsible for this price.?? This is way too much to pay for an old 30 year old movie. This overprice has eliminated potential buyers.
3,Singing was the best,The movie that I saw was about a black guy named Jimmy Cliff. He was so poor that he needed money and he started to sale drugs. The movie is about stealing and drugs. He was a fames guy because all the police wanted to get him and he was fames too because he sing a song that eveybody like it. The thing that I like about this movie is the songs. Another thing is that they put the real thing about poor people. I think that this movie you should rent it because is good and intresting. In my opinion I think that little kids sould not see this movie because it about bad guys stealing things and saling drugs.
3,the harder they com,The thing that I didn't like abut the movie was that how the people talk and the jobs they had selling drugs and also where they live.The thing that I like about the movie was the music they have and how Jamaica is..
2,?Cult Classic?,I bought this because I heard it was a cult classic. Not the greatest but it did hold my attention even though the dialogue was a little hard to follow. I wound up using the closed caption. The sound track is the best thing about this movie.
2,Rent it - don't buy it,"The good things about the movie are that the reggae music is good and they show a lot of pot and they showed realistic poverty and they filmed it in Jamaica. The bad things about the movie are the bad poverty and too much gun violence, and the actors had nasty dreadlocks. They should rent it not buy it."
4,Ivan's plight as relevant today as it was 30 years ago,"Poor country boy Ivan tries to make good in the city. Gets robbed a few times in a few different ways, falls in love with preacher's daughter, turns to violence. Gets killed. Ends up immortalized in Clash song lyric, but that's not in the movie, of course. Great soundtrack."
5,you can get it if you really want,"this is a great movie and a great story.the movie is about ivan who came from country after his grandmother passed,and finds life very hard with no work,so he goes for making a record and by the time his record is a hit and famous, the police is lookin for him because of a guy that turned on him, and sent the police on him,too much to tell, but buy it you wont regret it, it is a great story about hard life and struggle in jamaica and really teaches a great deal."
4,A singer finds that infamy is fame just the same.,"A cascade of misfortune and abuse blurs the ambitious vision of country boy Ivanhoe Martin (Jimmy Cliff) who migrates to the city to become a star performer. Combined with the current socio-economic hardships, exploitation in the music business, and the flourishing drug trade, a once harmless dreamer becomes a much publicized criminal/folk hero. Set to the bubbling rythms of reggae, with performances by Toots and the Maytals, this is a story of fame and success no matter what the cost."
2,They changed the product,"Or so it seems anyway. I always liked the original and used it for many years, but this product does not work as well. It's too gummy and heavy."
1,Product has changed dramatically regarding the smell. It is horrible and unusable now.,The product has the same name tho now comes in a new-look packaging. There is an awful chemical/dead-animal smell to it now which makes it completely unusable. The ingredients have changed only slightly but enough to ruin a once great product.
1,Not quite the same,"I ordered the KMS firm hold because I couldn't find it here in Miami, FL, but when it arrived I knew immediately it was different from the KMS I normally buy. The texture was clumpy and it had an odd odor. I don't know if it was do to heat or extreme cold exposure in shipping but I returned it and Amazon refunded my money."
3,Save your money,"There's nothing exactly WRONG with the book, but there's no real reason to buy it either. It's like a hardcopy of the online help available with your development environment. If you WANT a hard copy, then you're looking in the right direction. Otherwise, save your money."
5,North & South - complete collection,This was probably the greatest civil war movie ever done. The cast is phenomenal and the story line awesome. I highly recommend this movie. Collection was in great shape and seller was prompt.
5,North & South,This was one of the best movies that I have ever seen. It captured the time period perfectly. I would recommend this series to anyone that enjoys historical movies .
2,unhappy customer,"Collection was to have 6 CD,s--only 5 were included. First two were fine; next two have consistently hung upin the player and for this reason I am very displeased with the purchase. Have not tried the last one yet."
5,NORTH AND SOUTH ON DVD!!!!,OH MY GOD THANK YOU SO MUCH ALL 3 BOOKS ON DVD AT A REASONABLE PRICE. IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS TO BE ON DVD FOR SUCH A LONG TIME. I WAS BEGINNING TO WORRY MY VHS TAPES WERE GETTING WARPED FROM WATCHING THEM TOO MUCH. THANKS SO MUCH. THIS IS THE BEST TV OR EVEN MOVIE IVE EVER SEEN.
5,One of my favorites!,"These miniseries (Books 1 & 2) are two of my favorite of all time. Book 3 (which is included) is awful. The characters do things that are out of character for them. But Book 1 and Book 2 are wonderful. This is the story of two families, one from the north and one from the south. Orey and George meet each other on the way to West Point and become best friends for life. The war is looked at from each side and you feel for everyone in this horrible situation. I would recommend this dvd collection for anyone that has the time to invest in watching this great mini series."
3,"Good but abridged,","It seemed quite abridged from the original version and too many parts left out, though not indicated as such. That part was disappointing."
1,waste of my hard earned cash!,I had not seen this movie when it came out on TV but it was blatantly obvious that a lot had been cut from it. It left you wondering in so many parts of it. It would be an excellent movie if they hadn't cut it.
3,Good series,"I bought this because I remember watching it when I was younger. It starts out good, but gets a little boring at the end. The last cd was pretty boring, I didn't even watch the whole last part, but the beginning and middle parts are really good with lots of drama."
5,A GREAT SERIES,"1 OF THE BEST EPIC WAR TRILOGIES OF THE 1980'S. 2 BAD I'LL HAVE 2 BUY THIS AGAIN. NO THANKS 2 WARNER BROS., THEY REMASTERED THIS FAMOUS TRILOGY AND PUT IT ,THIS TIME, ON 8 1 SIDED DISCS. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT MADE 5 ADDITIONAL SPECIAL FEATURES WHICH I'M SURE ARE VERY INTERESTING. MY POINT IS, I HAVE THE ORIGINAL RELEASE THAT ONLY HAS THAT 1 SPECIAL FEATURE. WHY DID'NT THEY DO THIS THE FIRST TIME AROUND? ALL THEY DID WAS WASTE ADDITIONAL MONEY AND TIME ON THIS WHEN THEY COULD HAVE PUT ALL THAT ON A SERIES THAT HAS YET 2 B RECORDED AND RELEASED ON D.V.D. THANKS ALOT, DUMMY BROS."
3,North and South,"The majority of the mini series was really great, a lot of action and suspense. However, the ending seems anticlimatic like something was missing."
4,Good but not great,"Loved this series when I saw it on TV, the DVD was good quality but it kept skipping and freezing not sure if it was the DVD or operator error but the quality otherwise was really good"
1,The Completely Inoperable Collection,"I too am a victim of Amazon shipping defective material and refusing to stand behind the product. This was a Christmas gift to me from my mother. Amazon has given me every policy dodge in the book including first asking whether it was a gift then refusing to accept the return because I didn't order it! What a run around.This isn't the first time we've had problems with Amazon and the ""it's not our problem"" attitude. We are done with this on- line company. Anyone interested in starting a new one that understands customer service?"
2,Abridged???,I saw this miniseries on television when it aired for the first time. Sadly this version has been edited beyond recognition and many wonderful parts have been deleted producing large gaps in the story line. Very disappointing.
2,Packaging broken,"I love the series, but the DVD package is broken. It is a multi-disc set, so I have DVD's kinda floating around."
4,North and south,It was a great movie and i would want others to see it as well. It is very long but wirth it.
1,Horrible DVD product!,"I loved the series and when I saw this boxed set, I just had to buy it. What a MISTAKE that decision was. This DVD set is horrible! The picture quality is so grainy and it keeps freezing on screen, no matter which DVD player or TV I use. I cannot watch disc 3 at all!"
2,disappointed in quality of product,"I am another customer who received a faulty product. It is really disappointing to buy the series and than find that you cannot even watch it because of all the problems with the DVD. In book 2 both sides A and B have skips, freeze ups, breakups of the picture. In fact on side B I cant even get it to play the last several parts of the episode. Like the others I am out of the return date even though this is my first viewing of the set. It sure doesn't seem fair that the company or Amazon doesn't make good on a faulty product. The series itself is great but the product is inferior. I waited a long time to get this series and it sure is frustrating not to be able to get to use it due to a faulty product. Is ther no way for someone to make this right? I really feel cheated."
3,missing parts of the movie,"i watched this movie when it came out on tv back in the 80s,however the dvds i bought doesnt have alot of what was in the tv show, very displeased and upset."
5,Norht &South. The complete collection,the merchandise received within 2 weeks .New and reasonable package. Did not open the DVD yet .because I bought for a gift collection.In general it is good and very delightful with the Company
4,Melissa,"I read the North and South series and was intriuged to see the trilogy in picture. Sure it was filmed sometime in the 80's but for the most part it stays true to the books. The costumes and sets are a bit outdated and lacking real effects but the acting is pretty good. I would definitely recommend this for someone who is a real fan of the books. For everyone else, you may want to stick with more modern movies about the civil war."
5,One of my favorites,"This has always been one of my favorite movies,i also like that it came with all the disc in one case."
4,North and South,"Very good, just like I remembered when I first taped it on VHS TAPE. The story is a classic..."
2,NOT the complete collection!,"I ordered this ""complete collection"" from Amazon for my wife this December, 2010. We immediately began watching the series on our new DVD's. To our dismay, many scenes have been eliminated that were present on the series as presented on VHS -- important scenes. An example is Episode 4. The scenes presented on VHS have been eliminated in almost its entirety. Snippets have been retained, but for all intents the entire Episode 4 VHS tape has been eliminated from the DVD series. Other eliminations are present throughout the series. This is disgraceful, especially when the DVD's advertised are touted as ""complete."" Rest assured, they are not. This is a great mini-series. I just wish it were all here!"
3,Wish Book 3 had been left out,"I remember watching North and South when I was younger and I really enjoyed it - I haven't read the books. Seeing it again, however, left much to be desired. Though I really didn't expect it to be a historically accurate portrayal of the Civil War, this movie was so soapy that I found myself fast forwarding through many love scenes and could not bring myself to watch the entire Book 3 DVD because of its extremely far fetched beginning. Personally, I prefer the fairy tale ending of Book 2 to the addition of another book."
4,Civil War Tie in for Middle School Students,"Great aide for Middle School (Yes, High School and Elementary School will also get something out of it!)Civil War Students.Helps them visualize the circumstances, integrates facts, connects the issues and time lines and entertains...."
4,Book One and Two Superb - Skip Book Three,Book One and Book Two were superior. Terrific Civil War saga. Book Three is should be skipped. James Read does a fine job. Lesley Ann does too although she does show her age. Most of the other characters from Book One and Two are gone which is a shame.
5,North & South the complete collection,THis came right on time but I still haven't received my other order - I will be sending a complaint email on that. But this was great!!
4,North and South - DVD,"As is typical with sequels, faces change and you just have to accept it. Books 1 and 2 are masterpieces, even though book 2 gets a little too much on the romantic slant for my taste.Book 3? I have no idea where this came from. Might as well gave it a different name altogether. A few faces are carried over but the story makes no sense in connection with books 1 & 2. Book 3 is the only reason I don't give this whole series 5 stars."
4,Great Mini-Series,If you a Civil War buff this is a very good movie. I bought because I like to watch mini-series without having to be interrupted with commercials. Would recommend.
3,2 out of 3,"the first 2 parts were decidedly better than the 3rd. in fact they were excellent. in the 3rd, where did Orry's brother come from? Old characters gone and new ones introduced. a sad and bad finish."
3,North & South,"On the whole we enjoyed it, but towards the end found the story a little long winded. However it was easy to follow and happy to have it in our collection."
5,I am soooo haaapppyy this is here!!!!!!!!!,"I bought all 15VHS Tapes. The Heaven & Hell Tapes were hard to find but I found them on Ebay!This series I saw when I was 12 years old and I loved it! Mother made me sit down and watch it and I was hooked! I was a little disapponted with Heaven and Hell with Orry getting killed off the show and in the second set Book II adding a new Billy Hazzard, but I learned to live with it.I love these so much, I bought 2 DVD sets, one I can play over and over again and one to save after I wear it out from playing it over and over again!!!!!!!!!!!get this DVD set Baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,more Patrick,"This is Book 1-3 of ""north and South"" I think there might be more to it there are parts missing that i remember watching before. Is there more to it then just Books 1-3?"
5,North & South Books 1-3,This is an outstanding set and would recommend it highly. We had books I & II for years and did not know there was a book III.
4,"Great Series,Flawed Product","The series was better than I had hoped--good to great acting by all. Pleasantly surprised to see number of of superb actors in minor roles. Interesting to see Robert Wagner and couple others as ""bad guys"" plus Lincoln was disconcertingly short...but strong A re stars and script was fantastic. Only true negative was flaws with DVDs--hard to remove, couldn't readily tell when some episodes were on other side and one was either scratched/not made right so almost wouldn't play. Finally got it to play by FF at 4 times speed/stopping and then FF again...skipped some things but able to view 85% with difficulty. Would have returned but deterred by poor weather. Again greatstory/actors/scenes/music/all fab except for actual discs."
2,Stop watching after book two,"Well, this will be a short comment. We enjoyed the first two books of the series, even with it's shortcomings. However, they should have stopped at that point. Book three was a little over the top and all over the place. Resurrecting Bent was simply silly. Besides that, Madeleine and George becoming an item was a little disturbing."
4,historical epic from three novels,"I've only read the first novel in the sequence,but I thought that the movie was better than the book in this case.It did drag on some when it felt like nothing interesting was happening,but there were enough battle re-enactmentsfor any action junky.It might have been a little too clean ( washed people and all) for the times?I liked the result and American history students could gain from watching this."
5,North & South,"The movie was one that my wife has searched for over the past several years. The story deals with the effects of the Civil War on two affluent families; one from Pennsylvania and the other from South Carolina. Their struggles, beliefs, and tradegies are presented in a way as to create a deeper understanding on how one nation could split and be at odds with the other over political views. It further exemplifies the erogance of power hungry politicians, who expect the general population to bend to their wishes. An excellent movie!"
5,North and South,"This Emmy award winning complete box set collection of the epic North and South is worth every cent and will not fail to please. Patrick Swayze is brilliant as is Lesley Ann Downs,James Read, Kirstie Alley. An all star cast too numerous to mention.Seen on Tv about 30 years ago & now available on dvd. The picture quality is superb as is the wardrobe and locations. This lavish, extremely well presented production is the story of the lives of the Mains and the Hazards and their families as they struggle through the war between the North and the South (Civil War). It will have you gripped from the beginning. It is a story of love, passion, hatred, prejudice, greed, war, friendships etc. There are more twists and turns in this explosive tale than you can imagine.Brilliant ******"
4,Book 3 is AWFUL,"To say Book 3 is ""unwatchable"" is an understatement. I didn't believe it until I started watching it myself. After about 10 minutes, I found myself fast forwarding. Then I gave up about 30 minutes into it. AWFUL! I won't ever slip it in to my DVD player again! Book 1 and Book 2 are AMAZING though. I will rewatch and rewatch."
4,not sure,have not had a chance to watch it been to busy but was packaged well and arrived before it was scheduled
3,disappointing miniseries,"I wouldn't recomend this to any miniseries fan. The acting is terrible!! The costumes and set pieces look very fabricated and cheap. I enjoy watching miniseries on the weekends (all kinds), i didn't bother finishing the second book it was so disappointing."
1,Good Books Quick -- really bad,"""Good Books Quick"" is really bad. I never received my DVD. I just hope I get my money back!"
1,SUCKED,North and South - The Complete CollectionI bought this item and had to exchnge it twice because the same disc was defective. Amazon was great about exchanging the products but I find it unacceptable that I got a defective product twice. Moreover; it was the same disc in both packages which shows me there is a lack of quality control. I'm sorely disappointed in the quality of care Amazon shows its customers.
1,north&south,the dvd is defective/audio and video are distorted/scenes are so dark that the imsgesare indiscernable/the dvd was purchased from Amazon.
3,DVD,As far as the DVD's I am happy with everything. My only one thing I am not happy about was the shipping. Got in email saying its been shipped and the packaged arrived 3 weeks later even though I paid for expedite shipping.
3,Cult Classic vs. Great FIlm Making,"True Fiction. Even the character portrayals are historically inaccurate. John Jakes' storyline has been embellished, too, approaching the cheesy. Everybody is a general or a national hero. All the characters have plenty of expendable income and are attractive human beings -- even the ones who are poor and/or downtrodden. Jakes never wrote the stories this way.The acting and production didn't warrant any Emmys, either, by the way! A little over-acted, I'd say, complete with a truckload of bad accents and women's costuming that closely resembled 80s era prom dresses and/or something you'd find at Vicki's Secret.Yet, the first two miniseries in the saga, ""North & South"" and ""North & South: Book 2,"" are cult classics. The all-star casts, alone, are enough to coax even the toughest critics into sitting through them."
5,Love this movie,"I loved this trilogy and had all of the six books on video when younger. All except the last 30 minutes of the last book!! I have watched the whole thing a dozen times, but never seen the ending. I am dying for it to be released on DVD, because all we have is a DVD player."
2,North and South,"A big disappointment. We had seen the original HBO series. This volume skips over much of the original and leaves the viewer guessing about ""what just happened"". I don't recommend the purchase."
1,This Stinks!!,This whole series stinks! The manufacture had to be an adolescent who made it up in his garage.
4,Don't watch Book 3!,Books 1 & 2 were worth the wait for this mini-series to come to DVD - but don't bother watching the third book. It is pathetic!
1,Do not buy this collection!,"The North and the South was originally an epic series. Unfortunately, when they changed it from VHS to DVD, they saw fit to leave out HUGE sections. They have named it the ""complete collection"" which is totally bogus. No one should spend the money on this thinking they are getting the whole story."
3,North & South,I recently purchased the dvd's. The first and second were terrific. I was glued to the television. Even my husband who hates historical romance loved it...until we got to the third in the selection. It would have been much better to have never written this. It did not in any way follow the story line. It was as if you were watching a different movie.We were VERY disappointed in the 3rd part of the dvd.Patrick Swayze was NOT even in this 3rd part. Should have left well enough alone and dropped it after the 2nd part.b elenniss
2,North and South - The Complete Collection,"I received the North and the South - the Complete Collection. IT is a good quality product, and I enjoy what is there, however, there is a lot of the movie missing. It is advertised as the complete set, which includes all 3 books, but it lets out so much of the movie and drama, you miss much of the story lines. If it would not have been for seeing the movie beforehand, I would have been lost on much of the drama and stories of the individual characters. I think the advertising for the complete collection is very misleading, because of the omitted scenes. I would not recommend this to anyone! I will be cautious before I buy another movie from Amazon.com."
4,NORTH AND SOUTH THE COMPLETE COLLECTION,"I REALLY LOVED THE FIRST 2 DVD'S, BUT THE 3RD DVD IS ONLY THE FIRST PART OF THE BOOK AND IT REALLY LEAVES YOU HANGING. I WISH THE 3RD BOOK HAD BEEN DONE COMPLETELY. THAT WOULD HAVE REALLY BEEN A COMPLETE COLLECTION. I ADVISE ANYONE WHO WANTS TO KNOW THE COMPLETE SAGA READ THE THIRD BOOK."
5,North & South: A series to be remembered,"Before, during and after the Civil War, two friends George Hazard a northerner and Orry Main a southerner despite their beliefs, remain friends at a time when the north and south was divided with the problems of the nation.An excellent script, cast and music. A movie that made me appreciate history . I learnd more from the series than I did from the textbook I had when I was in school. I own book I & II on VHS. I want the DVD version."
4,North & South: The Complete Collection,"Book 1 & 2 were great, started to watch Book 3 & I thought hey, this is taking away from the first 2 books, they ended good, I may have to wait awhile befor I can watch the last book, if I ever do."
4,North & South,Was impressed by the quick delivery to Australia. Excellent quality and very enjoyable. Can really recommend.
4,An ancient epos - allways suspenceful and educational,The story is really exciting - after all the years i've seen the motion picture the first time - the revealed DVD collection is perfect in its quality regarding sound and pictures. Just the double-layer pressing isn'tvery comforting.
5,North & South - complete collection,"i really loved this epic. book 3 was not as good as books 1 & 2, but it was good."
5,wonderful entertainment,"Several years ago we watched North and South again after having seen it on TV years ago. It brought back many memories of quite a few enjoyable evenings. When Amazon offered it for a reasonable price, we could not pass it up. It arrived in perfect condition and has been a nice addition to our movie library."
3,North and South,"Good story, but not all of the disc's played. Some were supposed to have episodes on both sides of disc. They didn't. Very disappointed JosieBear1951"
1,North and South book 1 episode 6,This movie is the ONLY movie we have rented/bought that keeps pausing and skipping. Awful reception and terrible playback. Great movie but can't really watch it if it's out of sync.
5,North and South,Excellent series. I had seen this on television when it was presented many years ago. Have enjoyed watching it again in it's entirity.
3,Could be so much better,"This story was created with the intention to ressemble 'Gone with the Wind'; a classic in its time. I expected considerable less 'soap opera' narrative and far more authenticity to the struggles. As for the DVD rendition, very nice."
2,Disappointed,"I'm quite disappointed with the product, many chapters were left out and the ending has nothing to do with the original show. It was totally changed."
5,The Conquering Family,"I purchased this series of books by Costain many years ago. I loved it and re-read it often. Over the years I lost things during several moves. I am now a very happy History Buff! I am buying books I've longed for. If you love History, especially English History, your collection isn't complete without these books. I would urge anyone who loves the topic to enjoy this series."
2,Not all there,"The people that gave this one star must not have seen the original. This DVD is a mess.The disc change leavs out much of what has transpired. Bent survives a horrific fire,and the story leaves it there leaving us thinking Bent is dead. Then disc 7 and 8, ""Heavenand Hell"", have Bent alive and killing Ory Main. It's a mess of uncontinued story line,and people ""coming back from the dead"", and people reuniting without telling us how.My wife quit watching it when it got so bad. The book ""Heaven and Hell"" is just a tryat the author trying to take advantage of what was a good book, but a very mediocrevideo. ""Heaven and Hell"" is not worth watching It could have been great without all the discontinuity."
4,the semi-complete collection,I saw the original on tv years ago and decided to order this complete collection. It should be called the semi-complete collection because of the many missing parts! Books 1 and 2 were great even w/the missing parts but 3 was ridiculous. It definitely felt like it was rushed through. I'm trying really hard to ignore book 3 so that's why I gave it 4 stars.
5,north and south,"North and South is undoubtedly the best mini series to ever grace the TV screen. It is right up there with the likes of Gone With The Wind. It will be one of those rare movies that will endure for years. I would give this a 10 star rating if possible. It is loved by all members of my family, and they all want their own copy when it comes out on DVD. So Please, Oh please don't make us wait. By the way it would make wonderful Christmas presents."
1,north and south complete dvd collection,"this is a fantastic series that no one should miss out on. turn back the clock to a time whenlife was beautiful and harder at the same time...a true rendition of the family life and lossduring the civil war days....you will love not only the story and beauty , but fantasticactors, including the late patrick swayzee."
1,change of address issues,"When using the one touch feature on Amazon....I didn't realize that my old address was listed as shipping address. I immediately contacted them to correct this and was informed that no change would be accepted.....that it goes against Amazon policy. Since the product was sent via regular post without tracking, I was'nt able to have it forwarded. I was told that once the package is returned to sender...I will then receive a refund.......All this time wasted and still no product and waiting for a refund! I'll wait to see if I actually receive my refund.....Extremely DISSAPOINTED"
2,Disappointed!!!!!,The first two books of this version are a shortened version of the original North and South mini-series. If you didn't see the original televised mini-series you may still enjoy this but some scenes have been deleted and it affects the flow of the story. This version leaves you wondering what happened and how they got to certain points of the story - just leaves the viewer with too many unanswered questions! Don't waste your time/money buying this version if you're looking for the original mini-series.
2,North and South: The complete Collection,"I must say that this collection is not working. Book 2 does not play the last 3 chapters of each episode. I have ordered numerous things thru Amazon.com but because of these problems, I'm not sure I will order anything else. I cannot return this idea due to it being over 30 since I ordered it."
2,North and South,"I have waited so long to purchase this item, but it was always too expensive for me to justify its purchase. So when I saw Amazon.com had it at a reasonable price, I purchased it. However, the DVD that I received had so many viewing defects in it that it did not make it enjoyable to watch; and that was only viewing Book One! I haven't even gotten to Books Two and Three! I love North and South, but the item I received needs to be returned and replaced by Amazon.com. The item was brand new, not second hand. North and South deserves 5 stars, but the DVD I received deserves 2 stars or less."
1,Missing episodes -- a waste of money. NO stars!!!,"I saw this on TV years ago, and looked forward to sharing it with my family. What a disappointment. About every otther episode was eliminated, making one wonder what happened in between one episode and the next. I was lucky enough to find a discription of the eoisodes online, otherwise I would have been completely lost. I filled out the necessary paperwork to return it, but then couldn't find the DVDs. I suspect one of my family members got tired of hearing me voice my disappointment and tossed them in the trash."
3,North and South TV Series,I remember this when it first was aired on TV and it has some big TV stars for that time period.
2,Buyer Be Aware,"There are two different versions of this epic. One of them has 1212 minutes that is put out by ABC and the other has 1392 which is put out by Warner Brothers. I bought the epic that was 1212 minutes and was very disappointed. It was heavily edited to where it rendered the whole epic butchered. I watched the entire mini series in the 80's and love it. But, when I received the current version and started watching it I realized that a lot of the love scenes were missing. It had been heavily edited to where it didn't make much sense in places. It made the whole story line disjointed and you wound up having to guess what was going on between the actors. That is something I do not like doing. It ruined what was a terrific mini series for me. It was in my opinion a complete waste of money. I feel like I was sorely had by the company that put this travesty on the market."
2,Warning! this is NOT complete!,"While reading through the reviews I've seen that many of you are missing parts and find this collection incomplete. I do not own this collection my self, I only got the first and second book, because I found the third to be very disappointing. Now after reading the reviews it made me curious, so I went ahead and checked how long my DVD collections are. Well, together the first and second book are 1080 minutes and I noticed the third book is 262 minutes (this makes 1342 minutes). The ""Full collection"" here with all three books is 1212 minutes, so knowing that, it's pretty simple to figure out that they must have left 130 minutes out (!!!!!!!). That's over two hours!!! Crazy! I am SOOOOOOOO glad I got the first and second book seperately, because I don't want any scenes missing. I don't understand why they do this to DVD collections, do they think the viewers won't notice? If you want the WHOLE thing, don't buy this collection, buy each book seperately."
5,"Life, Love and Loyalty","North and South was a historically based production that brought the happenings of the 1840's to 1861 to life and I feel was one of the, if not the best learning tool of pre-civil war times. It was historically sound and followed the historical events as the writer of the books, John Jakes did. It brought life alive in that historical time and for me, gave me a much better understanding of what went on in the pre-Civil War years. I feel that having this all-time Mini Series in DVD format will open the doors to many more people and I would hope that in its production that both Descritive tracks and closed circut could be added for those who are blind/visually impared and the hearing impared."
3,Kylie is sure to bring you a smile and make you wanna dance.,"Kylie Minogue may not be the best singer, and the songs may be formulaic and fluffy, but songs such as _Hand On Your Heart_ are catchy and surgary enough to make you forget your troubles for a while. If you're into catchy, fun, and melodic pop tunes, then Kylie Minogue delivers a nearly perfect set for you."
2,Kylie The Pop Puppet,"Minogue's debut and biggest selling album (Album of the Year 1988 in UK). Starting with Number One single ""I Should Be So Lucky"" which was written in ten minutes and recorded in 30 minutes, the album is full of catchy Euro-pop tunes, including 3 UK Number Twos and 2 Japanese top 5 hits (6, out of 10 tracks, became international top 5 hit singles!). All the songs were well written and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman, the most successful producer trio at the time, except for The Loco-Motion, but there is no Artist Kylie but Kylie The Pop Puppet, and the fact that sound of this album does not differ so much from the ones of Jason Donovan and Sonia whom Stock Aitken Waterman also produced sucks."
4,Would Have Made A Great EP,"This album (originally a double-LP) would have made a great seven- or eight-song EP. Half the songs are either good or fantastic (such as ""King For A Day""), and half are, well, sort of half-baked. While this album is very inconsistent, the good stuff is worth the price of admission."
3,"Too many weak songs, too much noise","This was the first XTC album I ever heard and I'm glad I persevered. There are too many weak songs, too much pop psychology, and too much noise. Oranges and Lemons needs squeezing. The whole things sounds overdiluted and curiously indolent"
3,One of the weakest of XTC's albums/CDs,"I found this a mediocre XTC cd. I bought it right after it came out and have only listened to it a handful of times in its entirety.If you're looking for a great intro to XTC, whatever you do, don't start here. Start with Skylarking, English Settlement or one of their older CDs like Drums & Wires."
5,Brilliant and yet...,"still not a Top 10 l.p. or Top 40 single. I Lived in the L.A. area and ""Mayor Of Simpleton"" was routinely played on the Top 40 station KIIS-FM as was the follow up ""King For A Day"". This was at a time when Tears For Fears were riding high with ""Sowing The Seeds Of Love"" so it seemed as though the time was finally right for a big XTC breakthrough. Bad bet. Despite the most perhaps inadvertenly commercial release yet, and the major market city airplay, pop and alternative, XTC couldn't quite breakthrough. That being said it was thier biggest (American) hit since ""Black Sea"" and delivered the only American Hot 100 hit of their career (""Mayor of Simpleton""). Further disputes with their record company Virgin would follow (They originally rejected off of the tracks for the follow-up ""NonSuch, which would turn out to be the only product released by them for the next 10 years) and the ""Little Express"" soldiered on."
3,"moments of genius, but...","This album has some very fine XTC moments, but coming from a band that can put out brilliant ""beginning to end"" albums it's somewhat of a letdown. XTC fans will like it, of course, but I don't think this holds up as well as previous and future efforts from Partridge & Co."
3,"Badly recorded, a few good songs, the rest, forgettable","tracks 1,2,3,6,8 are worth keeping. Junk the rest. They should have hired Todd Rundgren again. The CD sounds like it's a Phil Spector abortion. I hope the remastering improved on the sound... probably not."
5,and I'm not even into this kind of stuff,"I won't pretend to be the most knowledgable xtc person on earth. Hell, I only have three of their cd's - Skylarking, Nonsuch, and Oranges & Lemons. I found Skylarking interesting enough, but was a bit put off by God and the Don't Want to Die Like You song. So I went into O&L; with a bit of warryness. At first, it really did'nt move me, but I gave it another listen. Then another, and another. Soon, I was looking forward to slapping in my walkman as I rode the bus. I would say my favorites are Cynicla Days & Miniature Sun.If you're on the fence with this album, give it a couple more listens, and see which way you fall."
1,Lacey should focus on the royal family,"This is a very misleading book about a man who was so much more then what Lacey actually claims. His sources are very questionable, especially Lansky's crippled son Buddy. It was well known that Lansky's family had caused him much heartache and his son Buddy especially. He made some bad business decisions and his health kept declining each year. Lansky decided early to keep his family far away from the criminal world so if you wanna know about Lansky Mr. Lacey, investigate criminals, FBI bugs, trial transcripts etc. etc.All of Lansky's friends died wealthy and you know why? because that was Lansky's own damn money. Robert Lacey doesn't get it. Avoid this book."
4,"Well written, well focused","The book besides giving a clear account of the gangster life he had, it is also well succeded to show his family laces and how they ended giving the reader a broad view of his life as a whole"
1,Criminal revisionism,"I can only assume the applauding professional and amateur reviewers were swept away by Lacey's evocative descriptions of Lansky's surroundings and cultural background. Lacey's detailed study is, I will readily admit, finely wrought, but this book should have been sold as fiction. Besides totally whitewashing Lansky, ""Little Man"" is peppered with countless factual errors (e.g. Joe the Boss Masseria was not waiting for a late lunch when he got hit in 1931-- he'd already eaten a huge lunch), many of which bolster the author's fantastic characterization of his subject. Where is there any discussion of Lansky's operation in Covington, Kentucky? Why is Murder, Inc. mentioned only three times in this book when Lansky was crucial to Siegel and Lepke's killing-for-hire enterprise? I certainly understand a biographer's decision to lionize his/her subject, but this exoneration of a well-documented monster is criminal."
5,Love my Nokia HS-5 Headset,"After my original hands-free headset bit the dust I was frantic to find a replacement. My Nokia flip phone, I am told, is now out of date and my service provider no longer sells the same type of headset. They so kindly suggested a new phone! As if!! I was thrilled to find what I needed on Amazon, yet skeptical about getting this one. But at such a great price I figured it was worth experimenting. I find it works just as nicely as the one I purchased a couple of years ago at the Cingular retail store. I'm as happy as can be. It was a little hard to fit the connecters into my phone but after a time or two of removing and reconnecting, it works like a charm. I would absolutely buy another one were the need to arise. I ordered from A1 Accessories because another reviewer had given them a thumbs up. I agree! My new headset arrived in my mailbox just a few days after ordering and was in perfect condition. $4 with A1 compared to $21 plus shipping from Nokia....I pick $4."
3,Love for Alaska still shines through,"Megan Mallory Rust's love of both Alaska and flying still dominates this second novel. She weaves a beautiful tapestry of the land and the skills required to survive as a pilot in its unforgiving ruggedness. However, while her heroine seems competent in the air, her invesetigative skills still leave much to be desired. The red herrings were not quite as obvious as they were in the first book, but the villain was apparent to anyone who reads a lot of mysteries. Rust relies on dropping the solution out of thin air, so to speak, instead of creating investigative acumen in her character. Here, it's the heroine impulsively walking into the one store in all of Anchorage where she could find the answers she needed. Still, it's a fine second book. I love regional and small town mysteries, and Rust delivers with her vivid descriptions of Alaska. She improves with each new book. I see she has a third one on the way. I can hardly wait."
3,Not as engaging as I hoped,"I read both Red Line and Dead Stick and while I liked them I found them both missing something I enjoy in mysteries and similar books. The storyline is interesting and plausible in both cases, and the writing is skillful, however the character development is lacking. Taylor Morgan, the main character remains two dimensional as the stories progress. I didn't feel as though I knew her any better at the end of the second book than I did when I opened the first one. I really enjoy stories set in Alaska and I've read everything by Christopher Lane, Sue Henry and Dana Stabenow so I was hoping for more engaging characters."
3,Did not inspire me,"It is true that this book describes the life of any youngster nowadays: divorced parents, loneliness, etc. And, to me, this makes it a very ordinary story, with a very ordinary ending. To me, it was not interesting, nor inspiring. On the contrary, it left me with a feeling of emptiness and a feeling that, unless a lucky event hits a youngster nowadays, his destiny is to become mediocre and unhappy. But I rate it with 3 stars and not less, because it is well written, and very realistic."
1,"be aware, product contains LEAD","I bought the product based on the information posted on amazon and other web pages. None of them informed that the product containes lead. what a surprise, once received the product has a small added label indicating ""proposition 65 warning: this product containes lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects and other reproductive harm""I did search on the wen and YES, in July, 2012 there is anotice of violation of california health and safety code.I am not even opening the cans..."
2,broken after 2 trips,"The part where the water comes into the pump consists of several small plastic rings and clips etc that are not durable at all. The whole thing fell apart after just two short camping trips. We could still pump water after it broke but it became a two person job (one person pumping and the other one securing the tube by hand) and the pump became very inefficient, spraying water at the broken interface instead of putting it in the bottle. I still have to check if there is any warranty on it but I'm not sure if I even want it replaced. I might try another brand that doesn't have flimsy parts at crucial places."
1,I dont know what everyone else is talking about . . .,"After researching water filters for a few weeks i thought i found a real winner with this one. I bought it for a week long canoe trip to a pretty untouched place with very clear, clean water. There were 8 of us on the trip. After three days and only about 10 or 20 gallons pumped, the pump was getting very difficult to pump. After 4 days, it was completely impossible to use and we had to use iodine. I am very careful with my gear, so i know this was not abused. The water we were filtering was clear and we stayed far away from any sediment or sand that would have clogged the filter. I am switching back to chemical treatment."
4,Refreshing,"I used this on a long backpack trip in the Idaho Sawtooths. It was hot and dry, and the snow melt was dwindling. It worked extremely well. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because it took a little longer than my last water purifier to pump the same volume. I was cooking for 5 and pumping more than 1 1/2 gallons at each meal was tedious. I will get another one before my next trip to speed the process."
3,"Works great, awkward to use.","This was the first water filter I've ever purchased, and it has treated me well. The only issue I have with it is that you need 3 hands to use it. It takes two to pump, and unless you're on perfect level ground, a third hand would be nice to hold the container you're pumping into.After I went backpacking with a friend that had an MSR Miniworks, I realized how unhandy this filter is. With the MSR filter, a Nalgene or Camelback actually screws to the bottom of the filter, allowing you to pump without worrying about knocking over your bottle with the plastic tubing, especially on unlevel ground or while balancing precariously over a stream.I would not recommend this filter due only to the awkward design, it has performed flawlessly otherwise."
2,Can't get Charcole Specs to purge...Even with Clean Water,I purchased this Water Filter to go in my backpack so I didn't have to carry water which is extremly heavy. After following directions and purging a couple of liters and watching the initial carbon black junk come out....I can't get the speck of carbon to stop. I'm using Clean Tap Water and have used 10-15 liters of water to purge. The water going into it is cleaner than the water coming out of it...I have contacted Katadyn to see if they will send me a replacement filter cartrage...waiting for their reply. Steve from Oregon
5,The Best Jed Marum CD,"We love this CD! We first saw Jed with Kimmie Rhodes in Dallas and loved his set so we bought his first two CDs at the show. We really liked those so we bought this one on-line and we love the whole thing. This is a great album. We're looking forward to the next one!The Soul of a Wanderer has a good mix of Irish, Scottish and American songs. The liner notes tell why he sings the songs, and where they came from, just like he does at his shows."
3,"Good, but ""Dissertationy""","Luther D. Ivory's thesis is that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. radical theological thought has an enduring, yet under-appreciated legacy. Further, King's radical challenge to the ""triple evils"" of racism, poverty, led him to espouse a ""democratic socialism"" that was a profound challenge to our system which neglects the egalitarian ethos. Though Ivory's thesis is well-stated, and his evaluation of King's thought a sound one, the book reads like a dissertation. As an evaluation of King's thought, it is weak on the compelling biographical events of King's life, which are equally gravitating. Recommended to those with a prior appreciation of the drama of King's life and activism, and in interest in an academic review of his thought."
4,A dry read but Radical Ideas,Ivory is not the most exciting writer. The book can be very dry. But what is worth the read is learning about King's theological framework. King's belief in a personal God that wants to transform society is like an early liberation theology. This book challenged me to be much more will to pay a cost to help change the world. King is a real inspiration.
3,Just Okay,"I wouldn't really recommend buying this one, it's not as hot as I was hoping. The bra part offers no support so you don't get any lift. Granted I don't think any guy will ever complain about a girl wearing this, I would spend your money on something else."
3,conjunto para una noche,"es unitalla y hubo ciertos problemas al momento de usarlo, pero la idea fue buena, puede ser de mejor calidad, pero esta ok."
4,Brief history of Lutheran theology and thought,"A nice little book of then neo-orthodox Missouri Synod History Professor Jaroslav Pelikan. (Pelikan later moved to the ELCA, and then to the Eastern Orthodox church). Its contents include: Luther, Melanchthon and the Confessional Generation, Rationalism, and the Nineteenth Century.Pelikan has an engaging style, and despite a deep content, is an easy read."
2,Nothing Great,"I bought this book as requirement for an MIS class. The book has good graphics, but the authors have tried to cram in a lot of information. As a result, things have'nt been explained systematically. One has to move to a later chapter to look for things discussed earlier. The quality of writing leaves much to be desired. In a nutshell, the book is only ordinary. It is much like a glossy story book for children, certainly not worth the price."
2,A high school level text book,"This book was part of the reading list for my It University studies (Copenhagen). I was much surprised to open the very large book and find, that is is much more a high school level textbook, than an acedemic book. I does introduce a large number of it-vocabulary terms, both concerning it-managemet and it-governance; but this I could have found just as easy, and cheaper, on wikipedia. Not a great fan of this book, sorry."
4,A very good album,This is the 3rd album by Bruce Dickinson and it is very good. The compositions are really very good and it is a kind of music that you can hear any time. I read some reviews that the sound is not very good and i have to agree. There is no bass but once you overcome this fact and get into the scene that this album provides you will surely like this album. The vocals of course are great.
3,Weak expanded version,"Everyone has to agree that ""Skunkworks"" is subpar to the rest of the legendary Dickinson's catalogue. That's why I assessed it with 3 stars only. It pales in comparison to gems like ""The Chemical Wedding"" or ""Accident of birth"".The additional tracks don't offer any improvement, frankly speaking. The production of such tracks is fairly lousy.I suggest you start on Bruce by listening to the expanded version of ""Chemical Wedding""...This one really rules!"
2,It's not traditional heavy metal,"The material on ""Skunkworks"" is not outstanding in any way. When Dickinson released his first solo album the songs had character and were built upon classic heavy metal, and they were over all much better. This time, it seems Dickinson haven't put the same energy into the song writing and even if it's not bad it's certainly not good either. I would say that apart from ""Headswitch"" there's not much to be excited about. But if you're way into modern metal (Soundgarden, Alice In Chains etc.) you might find this album enjoyable."
2,Bruce goes bland...,"This CD is Bruce's version of Halford 2wo project. This is an alternative-metal mess that goes nowehere fast. It's not really bad, but it's in NO way good. It's not even good for what it is. The production is top notch and the performances are quite good but the record lacks distinctive songs and catchy melodies. It's not quite the sell out as many have made it out to be but it's not lacking in strong, epic songs. The alternative influence is not a terrible thing overall but it doesn't help this record find a unique voice.Pick this up if you are a Bruce fanatic - it may have some gems for you but for the rest...it's just not worth it. Nifty booklet though."
3,Inconsistant,"I read the other review and as a result bought this thermometer. But when we used it there was always inconsistancies. You can take a reading one after another and they would differ by up to five degrees! So when my nephew was sick we didn't know if he had a fever or not because the readings kept coming back different. It does have a cute bag and is nice that you don't have to have the ear probe covers, but is not worth it. Also the directions aren't very helpful. We took it back and bought the Braun and have been very happy with it. It has excellent directions and a trouble shooting guide and help line number."
4,"Good book, but seen better","This is a good introduction to electronics. It teaches the basics about resistors, transistors, and stuff like that. However, I've seen too many books like that--there isn't enough practical up-to-date information, such as microcontrollers, or a good listing of parts, or projects. Its too much like a text book, and not enough like a hobby do-it-yourself book. There are a few great books that I'd recommend over this one--one being Practical Electronics for Inventors."
4,fast and dependable,"These are good quality cards that perform well in my Canon D-60s and Digital Rebels. Try to avoid buying from Adorama, they advertise new cards then deliver used ones. Had an experience with one of their ""New"" cards that almost cost me an important photo opp. Always check your storage media before a shoot, just basic photography and I should never had assumed the card was empty just because it was supposed to be new."
2,"Not the best, but not the worst...","My advise is that you CAN get this tape.... it had somehelpful tips... but not a lot. It's not really worth it. It goes over what we all know. And the ""How To Pose"" is a joke. It should be changed to ""How To Look Constipated."" You'd be better off getting a book about modeling. Don't overlook modeling school!! I am currently in a school and I have learned A LOT! That's the best information that I have ever found!"
2,rather dull,a rather dull acccount of a guy's life that no one remembers. interesting to read to realize how meaningless life is...you can write a book and think you've done something amazing and 70 years from now no one will care less.
4,Great product,"This was purchased as a gift and came in a timely fashion as well as the ""good fashion"" of the Under Armour! I would certainly continue business with this vendor anytime!"
3,Not the Almighty's best,"After what I consider to be one of the best albums ever ""CRANK"" I was very excited to get my hands on this release. To put it nicely I was very disaapointed in this album. I have been a fan of the Almighty since the beginning and I believe this is their worst album."
2,Reliability problems,"There are many features of this laptop that I like. However, it appears to have some serious reliability problems. In the four months that I've owned it, it has already had to be sent in for repairs twice, once for problems with the wireless card and once for a dead LCD monitor. Although it is covered under warranty, this still means being without it for over a week each time and paying almost $50 each time for the special shipping to send it to Dallas.I would not buy this laptop again."
1,Gateway as good as they were,"For the price, this is a well loaded machine and an excellent desktop replacement."
3,"Good history, mediocre writing","I had to labor through this book, rather than devour it. Still and all, I gained quite a bit of history. It was worth the effort."
4,"EASY READ, ACTION PACKED!!","These is a really good manga series. It has constant nonstop action. The action pretty much almost never stops!! I gave it for stars because its good, but it is not as good as Death Note and Naruto, but it is still good, just on a lower level."
4,Just the right spirit,"Dorati the orchestra builder shines in this recording of Dvorak's ""Slavonic Dances"". With his knack for working with ""lesser"" orchestras, he gets the ensemble to play their hearts out. The Bamberg Symphony is not exactly world class, but Dorati absolutely gets the most out of them. Their sound actually adds to the rustic nature of these pieces. It doesn't replace Kubelik or Szell, but I would not be without it. A little pricey for an old Vox, so you will have to decide what you will pay. A fun CD."
3,"Badly needed proofreading/editing, but story is compelling.","Arretta's story is the story of many women--young, vulnerable, taken advantage of by abusive men, she remained strong. Her circumstances growing up during the Depression and as an adult are heartbreaking--yet she survived with an amazingly positive attitude. This story is worth reading, even though the editing and proofreading badly needed work--spelling and grammar errors abound. This may be due to the fact that Arretta had a very limited formal education, but someone should have done a muchbetter job of working with the manuscript before it was printed."
1,Ultimately an offesive book.,"Humans are not animals. To suggest that they should be bred like animals is truly offensive. If this had portrayed women as it does men, there would have been a cry heard throughout the land. That there wasn' t is very sad. No one, male or female, should be allowed to take such a fascist stand and remain unciticized. And considering Tepper usually does a good job, this book is quite a disappointment. Please, Ms. Tepper, no more Hitlerian anti-male tirades."
1,Horrible anti-woman.,"I refuse to believe that women are so weak and in such need of rescue that we must enslave men in order to not be enslaved ourselves. I refuse to believe that we are such sniveling cowards that we must resort to the tactics of the worst of the patriarchy, or that a strong and good man is one who completely rejects the fact that he is a man.This underlying thought poisons every part of the book, making all of the women who are supposed to be strong into weak hysterical creatures who I am disgusted by.Or they would be if there were any redeeming characterization, but they come out as wooden puppets to preach her agenda. There is nothing real in this book."
3,subtle homophobia,"Though I agree with most of the other reviewers that this is a good example of feminist sci-fi that is balanced in its approach to dealing with men and women, her subtle homophobia put me off her writing for ever. How a feminist author can examine the roles of men and women in a divided society and still force everyone to be exclusively heterosexual is beyond me."
3,Interesting & entertaining despite leaps & gaps,"Someone recommended 'The Gate to Women's Country' to me in my quest to find an author in the vein of Margaret Atwood. I mentioned 'feminist science fiction' and Tepper's name came up.While not really Atwoodian in any sense, I enjoyed 'The Gate to Women's Country' nonetheless. The concept was interesting and most of the characters were engaging. While it definitely had feminist themes, Tepper did not allow the novel to get lost in the typical 'women=good & peaceful, men=evil & power-hungry' dynamic that could have easily won out.Though there were gaps in the story, some under-developed characters and much (in my opinion) that was left unexplained, the novel is pretty good. Grab it from the library or a used bookstore and enjoy some light sci-fi reading."
5,My Favoriate Book!! Five Stars!,"I was so lucky to happen to come across The Gate to Women's country! From the moment I began to read it, it took off. Sheri S. Tepper's ideas are so original and her characters are so well developed you can not help but to keep reading. There are so many twists and turns throughout the book and the ending is jaw dropping. I've seen alot of bad reviews from men that are borderline hysterical, stating this book can ""ruin the world"". It's a work of fiction and it is excellent, it has anything one could wish for in a story, drama, love, war, lies, suspense and on and on. The only negative comment I would have is that I wish it was longer."
2,"badly written, unsympathetic characters, unlikely plot","A heavy handed polemical work, this awful book has no sympathetic characters, (the protagonist is an idiot!) and a plot that makes you wonder if Tepper has any respect for the intelligence of her readers"
5,Excellent book!!!,"Love this book. Have been a fan of it for years, have lost multiple copies from loaning it out, and have finally remembered to order another copy. I am so glad I did. It is engrossing and quite the cautionary tale. Very good read!!!"
5,A book that makes you think about the roles men and women play,"Like all of Sheri S. Tepper's environmental sci-fi book, this one challenges fixed ideas. I've read it several times and always gain something new out of it. I bought this as a gift for my step-daughter who lives in Washington DC and she enjoyed it as much as I did."
3,Awful Editing,"The editing in this book is terrible! I don't know if it was because it was the Kindle edition but there were ALL kinds of typos - I saw ""she'll"" written as ""shell"" many times.The writing is clumsy and even bombastic at times. The saving grace of this novel is the story line, which although not well executed is an excellent idea, at the very least."
5,This Book Will Make You Think,I love this book. I read it years ago and have thought about it so many times. I just reread it and loved it just as much!
3,Alright-better than the others,Not nearly my childs favorite book that I had hoped but it still is decent. She likes books with more involvement - sounds/ color/ touch to it. She is my first child so hopefully the next ones will like it more. The sleep book is a little cuter than some of the others like it...
3,This was Chers' re-entry into music after 5 yrs,"This cd heralds a few choice cuts. They include ""We All Sleep Alone"", and ""Dangerous Times"". Here Cher is moving and dramatic. Her second two lps on Geffen were superior though, and ""Skin Deep"" and ""Working Girl"", are compositions that should never have been selected. Cher has improved as a singer since this cd.Some will love it for the hit "" I Found Someone"", penned by Michael Bolton, origional version by Laura Branigan. Cher cut the hit though.Not a bad listen but Cher can be better.Chers first version of ""Bang Bang"", is much better in its' Sonny Bono Harold Battiste production. This one is garish and hard."
5,A great comeback.,"I think this might just be one of Cher's best sets. It is very diverse with love songs (Hard Enough.., Main Man), power ballads (We All Sleep Alone), rockers (Dangerous Times, Give Our Love...), and even a dance number (Skin Deep) and a diva fest (Perfection). A record that can be listened to forward and backward."
3,Another Cher rising,"This album, surprisingly, holds up a decade after its release. Cher proved she had quite the vocal prowess to stand up to strident electric guitar power ballads. After a decade of looking for a musical direction, Cher found one with this set of emotional rock ballads. From the hits 'I Found Someone"" and ""We All Sleep Alone"" to the stunning ""Main Man"", Cher pushed her vocal range and came out a winner, for the most part. What holds the album from greatness are the attempts at upbeat dance (""Skin Deep"") and a depressing re-make of her mid 60s hit ""Bang, Bang"". Another memorable comeback from an artist full of surprises."
5,Superb Optics; Outstanding Value,"The vortex razor 8 x 42 are amazing field glasses. My trusty Nikons were stolen and I wanted to buy some Leicas or equivalent. After a lot of research I found this binocular. I bought for < the price of the German brands. Resolution is as the name implies razor-like. The low dispersion glass gives an almost uncanny 3-D feel to the image. Low light color resolution is fantastic. In fact looking through these I can see more color at dusk than without them. I could not be happier with my purchase. If you have older binoculars and want to upgrade, I highly recommend them, but beware when they arrive it is addicting to look through them, so budget a some time to go to your favorite birding spot and just enjoy looking around if the birding action slows."
4,Good card,Great card. Plug and play compatible for windows XP. Installed it and it does exactly what it's supposed to. Didn't work in my PCIe x1 slot - but I'm not sure if my hardware is at fault or the card. Works in my PCIe x4 slot though and gave me four more USB ports!
3,Stick with the Breeds Books,The second book in Lora Leigh's Wizard Twins series lacked something for me. Although it was better than the first these books do not read as well as her Breeds series
3,Could have been...,"This book had a good premise, and wonderful potential. I liked the storyline and the Lead Males but the Heroine was boring and whiny so she came across somewhat annoying. It's almost a rehash of the author's previous book of the Wizard Twins: Menage a Magick. Different sister, same annoying flat lead female character. There were a few intriguing subplots that sets up the reader for sequeals. It seems the leads into the stories are great but after that, all pretense for the storyline falls. The love scenes with regards to menage a trios: its pretty steamy but not as sensual or well written as her other books, but it still gets a girl hot and bothered. ~_^Overall its good for a simple read but don't expect anything really unique or to get really wrapped up into this book."
5,Wow!,"Unicorns, wizards, sorceress, magick and hot sex! What a story! I have no idea how Lora Leigh comes up with this stuff but what a gift she has. I hope she writes more in this series."
3,Lost Not In This Book,"Whatsisnames friend Aaron is a computer genius who has discovered a way to travel time with the use of the school computers.The 1st half of the book was interesting but the 2nd half not as great.It's Okay though,worth a look."
3,beginner level,This is a good book for beginner wood turners. It covers the basics in easy to understand language. Good photos also.
1,Nearly useless,"I checked this book out from my local library, and it took me about an hour to go through the entire thing and learn almost nothing. It's like he wrote a decent introduction to each of the chapters, and then moved on. There is not enough information given to actually *learn* from. The table of contents looks great. He just didn't flesh it out in a meaningful way. I got a lot more out ofTurning Wood with Richard Raffan."
3,Learn to Turn,"This book was recommended from a fellow turner. I was looking for more of a basics type of book. There is some basic tool and other information, however there was just a little to much on turning pens and things of that nature for me. I would say it was helpful but I was expecting more. I am trying to turn legs for Windsor Chairs."
2,Not really about Learning,"This book read more like a guide to equipment, a place for the author to self-promote and to (what seems like) promote products he seems like he has some personal interest at stake in. If you're looking for a book to really learn from, this isn't it. I purchased another book by Raffan, I think called turning wood, which was substantially more useful as a turning neophyte.Turning Wood W/Richard RaffanI think you'll find it more useful (I should have read the reviews!!)"
4,Good for beginers,Large detailed photos. Printed on good quality paper. This book could be recomended to those who are just curiouse about turning to the beginner just starting out.
3,"Good book, but not everything you need to get turning well...","This book is enough to give you a fair idea of how to do woodturning. And I am learning a lot from it. But then again, I am learning from watching the JET Shopclass Series videos online, as well as doing projects with the guys at my local woodturning club. I rate it a 3 only because I think somebody might think a rating of 5 would mean this book is all you need to learn.Simply put, this book is simply one of the resources you will want to dig into as you start woodturning."
1,Mostly a project book,Let me save you a few bucks. This tells you to how to set up your tool rest and then practice using your tools. That's it. The rest of the book is projects. They spend a ton of the book on using burls to make bowls. There has to be a better instructional manual out there. I learned a lot more just surfing the web for free.
1,crapps,"Makes a good Coffey table book, lots of nice pictures. Would be lying if I said I did not learn some thing from it but then as an absolute novice I had to pick some thing of. The projects suggest were rather advance for the beginner - just leaves out a lot of things for which i was looking for answers"
2,You'll probably learn more from the internet,"I bought this from Amazon after reading the reviews... I'm not an expert turner, so I had high hopes that I'd learn some useful, practical tips. It really isn't such a great resource. Spend your time on YouTube and other net sites and you'll proably learn much more."
2,Not what you'd expect,This book doesn't teach you anything other than the names of your tools and a vague description of when and how you'd use them. It came in my package as a deal but wasn't really worth anything to begin with. not recommended... Unless you really don't know anything about wood or woodturning.
2,Disappointed,New to woodturning and even I knew most of the topics in this book. You are better off learning the basics from woodturning websites and look for a more advanced book.
1,A waste of time,"Having seen the trailers and knowing something about Danny Boyle, I bought ""Sunshine."" Mistake. The film was arguably THE worst sci fi film I've ever seen. Confused storyline, incomprehensible plot, stock characters (and one who appears from nowhere with no explanation of how he got onboard the Icarus), ""standard"" special effects, woefully inadequate (incompetent?) editing. A total waste of time, except for Cillian Murphy's performance, but even that couldn't save this cinematic disaster.There is no chemistry between actors/characters, and the idea that the film delves into ""philosophical dilemmas"" is laughable.Save your money. Save your brain. This flick is on a par with ""Battlefield Earth."""
1,"Boring, Unbelievable, and Poorly Written","Do not believe the reviews that are flattering about this movie. As a Science Fiction fan and a movie fan I still cannot give it more than one star. It is poorly conceived, disjointed, boring, and has those kind of camera shots that flash rapidly because they did not have the money to make decent special effects; so instead they use flashing camera gimmickery such that you cannot even tell what is going on. The writing is worse than the cinematography...all in all it does not get much worse than this. I wasted my money on this film...I hope you will not do the same."
1,One of the worst films ever made,"I read these other reviews and wonder if they saw the same poorly acted, poorly shot, incoherent film that I own. Awful quality in every way, especially the grainy, blurry visuals. I wonder how a movie like this ever gets made when independent film makers with something to say are so routinely rejected by the major studios.Best to borrow this one first before sinking your hard earned cash into it, I would counsel. I found it unwatchable."
1,Great Movie Awful DVD Transfer,"I was eager to see this movie after reading all the reviews. I am not really a great fan of thrillers but this one had me on the edge of my seat. The directing is wonderful and the movie is really excellent, so from that perspective I was really pleased.So why the 1 star?The DVD transfer is probably one of the worst I have ever seen (and I have a LOT of dvd's). The pixelation/artifacting is so pronounced that it really detracts from the viewing of the movie and creates a real distraction to any real enjoyment. Almost every scene has some form of really pronounced mpeg artifacting and this really should not have been released as it is.The DVD just feels like is was rushed into production with so so quality. I can't speak to the quality of the BD version but the DVD version is really terrible."
4,"Great movie, but some versions won't play on Sony Blu-Ray players","I like the movie, but I have to give the Blu-Ray version only 1 star because it won't play on Sony Blu-Ray players (both stand alone and PS3). It used to work but Sony shipped firmware to add 3D functionality for other titles and it broke the ability to play this disk. When you play the movie, the video commentaries come up picture in picture style and you CANNOT disable the pop ups. It has been broken for half a year now and despite two firmware updates from Sony it is still broken. Don't buy this disk if you have a Sony player until Sony fixes this.Update 01/19/11: Fox has fixed the issue (unknown if it was actually Fox or Sony's problem, but Fox fixed it.) I received a free replacement disk. Make sure if you buy this and you have a Sony player, you get the latest version of the disk which has a UPC code ending in ""82"" and not the broken one ending in ""80"".Broken version gets 1 star. Fixed version gets 4 stars."
4,Great Film - Not PS3 Ready!,"This is one of my favorite Sci-Fi films. Great visuals, great story.. love the film and cant say enough. !!MORE IMPORTANTLY!! I purchased this blu-ray to experience the enhanced 1080p experience. My only player is my PS3. I have now come to find out this blu-ray will not run on the most current firmware update of the PS3. The PIP(picture-in-picture) commentary cannot be disabled. This for me makes the film unwatchable. I say again, if you are planning on watching this on a PS3 with the current firmware you will not be able to disable this most annoying special feature! ( Approx 10 times during the film a window will pop up with a some video of behind the scenes stuff. This will play over the movie, and for me ruins the experience.)You have been warned!Dave C."
2,I've got a real problem with this movie...,"So, (spoiler alert) the sun is going out and the people on the spaceship are going to restart it and save the earth. They have a lot of challenges to overcome like in any movie, and then they overcome them. But here's the thing about the movie that you won't believe: no one ever looks really serious and says ""It's daylight saving time.""Not one character. No one says ""It's daylight saving time."" In the entire movie. I know you don't think it's possible, but if you watch it you'll feel like you wasted 4 hours of your life (time moves slower when you're waiting for someone to deliver an amazing line). What were the writers thinking!?"
4,"better than most other so called ""fun summer movies"" in 2007,","Is this movie flawed=yes, is it still an exciting and well made movie=heck yes!Not sure how this film will translate when it goes to DVD (you are going to need to watch it on a big widescreen TV) but in the theatre it was beautiful to watch. The film makers stretched their limited budget and made a picture that has some amazing images.The 1st and 2nd acts of this movie had me thinking ""wow-this could be a classic"" but the film does stumble in the 3rd act and what could have been a great film is turned into a good film. Yes, the film borrows/steals from the best but the images along with very good acting from the leads helps lift it above these weaknesses.Watch it on as Big a Screen as you can and enjoy what I consider one of my favorite summer popcorn movie.In Short - much better than most other so called ""fun summer movies"" that came out in 2007"
5,This is a Great film! (Spoilers in my review),"This movie was outstanding! it was slow to start but it was so Visually stunning that I never took my eyes off it. I did have one big problem with some of the people. To be earth last hope and the best we had for the job they certainly became stupid fast. To use a movie line, ""The needs of the many out weight the needs of the few."" No way do I buy that the smartest people in the world would take a chance the last chance there was to ave the world and blow it because they felt the need to rescue a few people. Yeah they justified it by saying they needed the other package but the underline thee was to save the crew from the other ship. So that was my biggest problem with this movie. So that being said the picture redeemed itself in the last half, with suspense and action! I enjoyed it tremendously! And yes as others have said the ending will blow you away!"
1,Fix the PIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,As many others have already said the film is unwatchable. Unlike the others I have a Panasonic blu-ray player and it still will not let me turn the PIP commentary off. Disc is now coaster.
3,70% of this movie is AWESOME,"Great special effectsGreat plotVery good actingand then - this movie goes off the tracks in a manner I have never seen before. I will not spoil it and I should say I still watch it every once in a while until it pretty much becomes a ""Halloween"" type movie."
4,Gift,I brought this movie for a friend who first saw the trailer on a movie that I have in my collection.
4,Surprise find on some cable channel. Excellent.,"Nice film I never heard of. Like premise, special effects, actors/characters. Would recommend for SYFY fans. Action, sort of. Did have a problem with one specific bad-guy character but other than that. Worth a look. Not a date movie unless GF, wife, into SYFY. Recommend."
3,Just watch the first 3/4's.,"This review is strictly for the uncut, cable-tv version. I do not have any of the DVDs or Blu-Ray.Sunshine is a pretty good movie up until the last thirty minutes. Then, it becomes quite predictable, silly and kind of unrealistic (even in a sci-fi way), which is too bad, because if they had just kept tempo Sunshine could have ranked as a cult classic right up there with Pitch Black.. One aspect that doesn't disappoint is the soundtrack. Very topnotch and appropriate. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to exist outside of the film."
2,Expected more from Danny Boyle,"Here's the problem with Sunshine: it just wasn't that good. It wasn't bad but, when you're used to Boyle creating things like 28 days later, Slumdog and Trainspotting, serving up a warmed-over Solaris-meets-2001 falls below the standards you expect from him.There were plot holes large enough to pilot the Icarus through such as:* Who was the baddie? The Icarus I captain gone nuts that no one noticed entering the Icarus II?* Why were they able to breathe in the payload area? What a waste of oxygen.The tried and tested formula of captain-dies-first was used yet again. The table scene was ripped directly from Alien and so on.I wanted to like this movie but the characters were so underdone, I had a hard time caring about any of them.One to rent only methinks."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The perfect example of a failed film, Sunshine offers many interesting and well-imagined scenes and scenarios in its first half before finally collapsing under the weight of a ham-handed subplot with poorly-grafted on religious undertones (apparently the writer and director had competing visions); watch it if you like sci-fi, but expect a flawed product."
3,Gripe time,"1. I hate CGI- BRING BACK MODELS! they have mass and look ""real"" ie 3D-CGI looks fake,has no 'mass', and looks 2D2. Why do directors feel the need to add the 'rumble' of a space vehicle as it goes through space-no air in space=no sound;3. Even more annoying why do they foley in a ""woosh"" when something close goes by: ie: the comm towers,the title BRAVEHEART, going in throught the window at the very start of LES PACTE DES LOUPES, STAR TREKs bottle of Champagne etc etc etc. juvenileWhat a great team of actors wasted in a remake of EVENT HORIZON"
4,Beautiful showcase of Blu-ray,If you liked 28 days later you will like this movie. The cast does a great job of setting the mood and none of it feels lame or B-movie-esque. The special effects are top notch and you will be amazed to see what Blu-ray does with it.
5,Stunning HD experience,"As a film Sunshine has some brilliant and wonderful moments of sci-fi goodness.... and devolves into a shoddy horror flick at the end. Nevertheless, with so little high end science fiction in existence, this is pretty much a must have for any aficionado.I originally saw Sunshine in 4k digital projection. The exterior CG sequences were absolutely mind blowing! And this beautifully done 1080 Blu Ray is nothing less short of stunning. You can sit 4 feet in front of your TV and marvel at the detail - it takes me right back to that 4K projection. Very little digital noise and blocking, incredible sound. Definitely a WOW piece for your Blu Ray home theater."
2,A poor effort,"I like good sci-fi films, of which this is not one. I found it vague, incoherent and in places rather silly. Moreover, I found it uninvolving, in that I really couldn't care less about the fate of the astronauts. It has some nice FX, but, as in ""Star Wars"" I-III, all the FX in the world can only make a poor film more visually impressive. There needs to be more. There wasn't."
1,Broken special features make the movie unwatchable,"Do not buy this product. The special feature called Picture in Picture inserts a picture in the frame that offers a special look at the set of the particular scene. The problem is, this feature cannot be turned off. So, for about 12 scenes during the movie (more than half the movie) the audio is not audible because of the picture in picture. It is impossible to watch the movie because nothing can be heard. Until this glitch can be fixed there is no reason to buy this unless you've already seen the movie and don't mind not being able to hear it."
4,PIP issue FIXED with Amazon copies!!!,"PIP issue is fixed!!!Originally I bought a second hand copy of the movie from ebay which had PIP issue with my PS3. Fox Searchlight was unable (and rather unwilling) to fix any issue with the old copy, which I understand since it was a second hand purchase. The rep stated that they do not make this movie any more, and that any disc on sale (even Amazon ones) are OLD as well. Extremely disappointed, I took chance and purchased a brand new copy with Amazon. Playing the movie RIGHT NOW, and it doesn't have PIP issue... I'm so happy. FINALLY!"
2,"Interesting at first, then completely falls apart for the last 45 min.","Great soundtrack and sound effects. Ultra-clear blu ray quality. The first 2/3 of the movie are interesting and create a good sense of dread, but the last 1/3 of the movie seems to have been spliced in from some random 80's horror flick and it completely ruins the movie. I would rent it at most. Not a buy."
3,"Had possibility, neat looking","Looked great, had some great ideas that left me thinking a little, but the horror tropes got in the way of what could have been truly amazing. I'm not sure I have any specific ideas about HOW that could have been done, but then again I'm not a director.It's not bad at all, I liked watching it, it just sort of lacked something, despite it starting out as really incredible IMO."
4,Surprisingly decent film,"Visual effects were pretty well crafted. This movie did not have the usual ""big name"" actors (big deal). So if you are one of those losers who are looking for overpaid actors or some deeper meaning of life to be revealed through a sci fi movie then don't watch it. Or if you are the type who will over analyze a movie instead of accepting it for what it is (A MOVIE...... NOT THE PATH TO INTELLECTUAL EUPHORIA) then find something else to watch. If your desire is a simple enjoyable movie with decent effects and a plot twist here and there, then its worth the 1 hour and 48 minutes."
4,I thought it was pretty good,"It did a great job of bringing you into the story, had some amazing visuals and quite a few unexpected plot twists that kept me on the edge of my seat. The odd mixing of campy horror and hard core sci-fi did feel a little out of place but overall I dug it. Very good movie."
2,Excellent Picture Reduced to Freddy Kruger in Space. Sad,"This was one of the best science fiction films I had seen in years with great writing, good acting, super visuals but no!!!!! they couldn't leave it on that level. The last 30 minutes are a heartbreak. I don't know who made the writers or director change the ending, I know this can't be what they had in mind. This film bordered on truly great but as soon as the mad slasher was thrown in to the plot I started thinking about supper or what I was going to do the next day as I lost all interest in the film. What a waste with an ending so bad that you feel you had been sold on a great car and it turns out to be a lemon after you bought it. I expect Friday the Thirteenth movies to be boring, predictable, for teenyboppers so I am not disappointed. This film had so much promise so the junk at the end disgusted me with the extreme trashing of talent. Pathetic."
2,Sperm fertilizes egg,"Reviewer Altman comes closest when he asks ""where does their gravity come from in this 2001-look-alike spaceship?"" but when 2001: A Space Odyssey was released, at least somebody picked up on the sperm-appearing Discovery swimming in space. Sunshine's imagery is much more explicit, but a search among hundreds of Amazon reviews (and Ebert is clueless) for a hint of recognition fails. Perhaps viewers are too distracted by the numerous logical and fundamental scientific flaws in the plot and script to see the core concept."
3,You might get sunburned with Sunshine . . .,"Imagine if you will you are part of an elite team of astronauts on a mission to save the Sun from extinction to perserve the fate of mankind, would you honestly believe that boarding the spaceship christen the ""Icarus 2"" will bode well? You will see what happened to the first crew of first ""Icarus"" ship who had gone on to the ""save the Sun mission"" seven years prior to this one.Sorry that was a bit of a spoiler, however the cast Cillian Murphy and Michelle Yeoh and company deserved a better script. The cgi is done beautifully, however there is just something missing to this film that prevented me to give it a four star rating. I would suggest that you view it as a rental (digital download) before purchasing the film."
2,Unreliable Human Pilots,"I don't buy the premise of this movie. Why would so much resources be expended to create a pleasant and spacious crew area when they're not needed in the first place? Send a remote bomb. In order to save the mission, the crew always goes with their first solution (which usually entails somebody getting sacrificed).Other problems: there is no sound or gravity in space. Why would a modern sci-fi movie forget this?It also rips off better films like: 2001 A Space Odyssey, Outland, Silent Running, Solaris, Alien and Aliens.Good special effects (if you can follow the action).[DW]"
3,Sunshine,"This movie has a decent premise, excellent special effects, an average acting. Speaking for myself, this equals a three-star review. If you like,2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)orAlien Quadrilogy (Alien/ Aliens /Alien 3 /Alien Resurrection), orThe Nightmare on Elm Street Collection. You have a chance of liking this movie. However, I thought the last 20 minutes was bad, or should I say, cheesy. This film is not brilliant, what it is is an updated version of 2001 with a slightly different plot, and putting today's technology to use. So, that's where you get the better special effects."
1,"Really, really bad","This may have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm actually surprised that my husband and I didn't shut it off. This is probably because this movie was the only thing we had to watch in a world where Tivo makes TV viewing so darn efficient.This movie has serious identity issues. Is it Armageddon or Night of the Living Dead?I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I garnered no deeper meaning or even a moral in this tale, just a bad storyline and bad acting.Sometimes movies are just bad. This is one of those times."
2,More Fizzle Than Sparks in Journey to the Sun,"It really is hard to find a good science fiction film isn't it? Most entries are actually fantasies. This film purports to be a bit more technically believable than most; a mission is sent from Earth to reignite our dying sun. People old enough to remember the Skylab missions from the early '70's might find something rather familiar about the interiors of the ""Icarus 2."" Speaking of historical notes, it's symptomatic of the declining importance of Hollywood to the film industry that all American allusions are missing from this film; fifteen years ago, that obviously wouldn't have been the case. Half of the crew seem to have been recruited from Asia, the other half from feuding twenty-year-olds on a reality TV show. Though the film has many gloriously golden views of the sun, it ultimately degrades into another gory kill-fest. Too bad; it had potential."
3,"Intriguing, but what is with the ""creature""?","Sunshine is a sci-fi movie with promise. A team of astronauts and scientists are sent to ""restart"" the sun. A previous mission failed, so humanity's hopes are dependent on this mission being successful. The closer the ship gets to the sun, however, the more perilous the assignment.Then strange things begin to happen. And in a strange plot twist not even necessary to the tension and drama of this movie, the director and writer adds a weird and bizarre element the the plot. Fr me, that gums up an otherwise interesting and ""credible"" sci-fi action movie.I always wonder what happens in those back rooms that allow these types of production decisions to be made."
2,Amazing visuals...worst movie iv seen in a while,I just got a new HD tv (Samsung 4771F) and this is far and away the best blu-ray i have watched onit yet. Its almost worth watching this movie just to see how amazing it looks... but thats it! Im a big fan of sci-fi and this movie was just not well done. Clearly all the budget was put into special effects and not the script or good actors.
4,a little mixed metaphor ain't a bad thing,"I'll make this brief.If you liked 'Solaris' with George Clooney, you will likely enjoy this picture alot...And vice-versa.This is a science fantasy drama, a vehicle for metaphors about the Sun, and a collection of character sketches. It's about Icarus falling into the Sun. And the danger of ""Staring into the Sun"". The ensemble cast perform their parts with grit and seriousness.. the sense of danger and of isolation is palpable... the sets, effects and music are on point.As a mood piece, it excels.As serious 'science fiction'? Maybe not... but hey- is there really any such thing, anymore? We're a scientifically jaded culture, now that science is big business. Yes, jump starting the Sun w/a theoretical fusion bomb is silliness.. but that's just the vehicle to examine these characters- that's what this film is about."
1,AWFUL!,Don't waste your time. This movie is not well written and the actor's talents are wasted (except for the one pilot girl....they could have done with her fake doe eyed face). An awful movie.
4,Good time at the cinema,"[SPOLIER] it was surprisingly good, keeping tension and mystery constant throughout. my only complaint is that if felt like it ended abruptly, with most of the crew dying within the last 10 minutes. other than that, sci-fi at its best, with a particular emphasis on the ""fi"". oh, and for the reviewer who gave it 1*, ""irregardless"" is not a word, unless you really meant to say ""not without regard"" or ""with regard""."
1,UNWATCHABLE!!! Read before purchasing...,"This Blu-ray disc does not work with the PS3, which I would have known if I'd read these reviews. It's awful, unwatchable. Wish Amazon would make a note of it somewhere prominent. Unbelievable!"
1,This movie sucked . . . .,Started out good but quickly degraded to a 3rd rate horror movie - evil undead captain killing people with souped up butter knives. Saw this movie with smart thoughtful people who all agreed - no deep meaning here other than NEVER go onto the ghost ship and avoid butter knives.
1,SUCKS!,One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Cheaply made junk movie with lousey actors. Don t waste your money. don t take it for free!
2,Not Recommended,The film has no romance & no music (or very little) which would have made me care about the characters.
1,Sunshine - BD,"Heard much about this flick, but just want to know if the PIP issue is fixed for the BD version of this movie?"
5,My favorite film,This film is my favorite film ever. The emotion you feel during watching is like nothing else you will ever feel while watching any film. It is true art.
3,IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN SPACE?,"OSCAR WINNING DIRECTOR DANNY BOYLE HELMS THIS AMBITIOUS SCIFI THRILLER. A CREW OF 8 IS ON ITS WAY TO BOMB THE SUN TO CREATE A NEW STAR TO SAVE A FREEZING EARTH. SEEMS THE SUN IS SORT OF BURNING OUT AND A BOMB THE SIZE OF MANHATTAN WILL BE LAUNCHED..BUT THIS PLAN GOES AWRY.A TALENTED CAST LED BY CILLIAN MURPHY, ROSE BYRNE, CLIFF CURTIS, CHRIS EVANS AND MICHELLE YEOH ARE EFFECTIVE AND THE VISUAL EFFECTS ARE EXTRAORDINARY.BUT THE FILM IS BLEAK TO SAY THE LEAST AND ITS FINAL THIRD SEEMS FORCED AND INEXPLICABLE. A BITTERSWEET ENDING OFFERS HOPE.A GOOD FILM THAT SHOULDVE BEEN MUCH BETTER."
4,Probable Cult Classic in the Years to Come,"This movie is a character study. It's not an adventure flick. Think The Fugitive or Alien rather than Star Wars. In the Fugitive and Alien, the audience had just enough backstory to be able to empathize with the characters' decisions; so too with this movie.The cinematology was worth the rental price. A wonderful early foreshadowing scene showed the sun morphing into an eye as the ship was silhouetted against it. Such touches will keep folks watching the movie in the future, much as folks watch 2001, A Space Odyssey.The acting was competent, though I agree with other reviewers who noted how little interpersonal relatonships contributed the the character studies. I think the movie suffered because it didn't work in more of such human pathos. The end of humanity should have pathos, after all.One disappointment. The writer and director elected to add horrific elements near the end, elements that I didn't feel belonged in a character study."
4,So close,"Amazing director taking his hand at sci fi. As with nearly all science fiction movies, it doesn't live up to the imagination presented in the opening. It deteriorates into a quasi-horror movie, abandoning the sci fi premise for a standard ending. If you saw Slumdog Millionaire, watch 127 Hours (just eat and hydrate first). If you want brilliant sci fi, watch 2001, Never Let Me Go, Blindness, Blade Runner (Director's Cut), 12 Monkeys, The Fountain...."
2,Sunshine- disoriented,"One gets the feeling of Alice in Wonderland, where Alice really doesn't know what's going on, but wants out! I get the idea the director wanted to do a ""2001"" but got lost in the script and special effects. Not my favorite sci-fi film."
4,Recharging the Sun,"4 of 5 stars for this exciting and suspenseful sci-fi movie. An unusual storyline with solid action and sci-fi special effects. A bit far-fetched (traveling to the Sun to explode a bomb to re-energize the Sun), but hey, its Sci-fi. Very dramatic photographic and editing style with extreme quick cuts during the action fight scenes. This is a great movie! Frankly, I am surprised I'd never heard of it before now. Highly recommended. Oh make sure your sub-woofer is cranked-up!"
2,Good start - Hollywood ending,"Dropping a payload on the sun to save the Earth is a difficult enough task. However, the film-makers thought it necessary to add the typical plot line of evil undead captain sabotage. Hence, the movie went from interesting to mindless mediocracy. The only saving grace was the deep space visual cinematography."
2,Why Bad Things Happen to Good Films,"I was enjoying this film up until the last 20 minutes or so. We have an enjoyable , intelligent science fiction space drama with some real moments of suspense as the gallant crew attempts to complete their mission of ""re-igniting"" the dying Sun, when ... WHAM!...out of left field comes this inane, confusing slasher flic finale. What a bummer! It's like the director took ill before the film was finished and handed over the end to his insane nephew who had his own vision of what the film should be.A real waste of time, folks. File this under ""When Good Films Go Bad"""
2,Sunshine fails,"I just watched this movie, twists and turns? Saw them coming. I found some of the movie hard to follow, unbelievable and just plain boring. Fifty years ago we started into space and we are to believe that this is what space travel will be in Fifty years? I didn't care for the actors, or their characters. This movie reminded me of Event Horizon but never got that good, just when you thought something was going to happen, it doesn't.Rent it, watch it, forget it."
2,Moonshine,"Sunshine needed a monologue before it decides to assume the mental capacity of the viewer. It lacked that and jumps straight into the film without giving an account of what's going on. Like everyone else, I would like to think of myself as a man of above average intelligence, however, there were many a times while watching this film that I felt that a lot of things weren't explained. Sunshine truly doesn't deserve the celebration it got, not to me. And I don't think it was because I started watching this is at midnight, it just for varied reasons, didn't manage to explain itself that well. The film was also a little eerie but I never quite understood who's making the sacrifices and when. The movie just felt short of being taken quite seriously."
1,Shame about the Ending,"Great premise. Great cast. Nice atmosphere, suspense and effects. Extremely cool sun. Pity they threw it all away at the end. Just when it ought to get really interesting, they shrug and turn it into a cheap, predictable horror flick. What a waste of talent!"
3,Good Movie,It is worth the rent when there is no football on TV. The acting is better than the plot so just go with it.
2,Um....,"I was excited to view this via Amazon streaming and a ROKU,.But ended up underwhelmed and disappointed.It showed promise for some time, but when it degenerated into a slasher flick with a villain that keeps coming back?!?!?Seriously, this was just silly and out of place. I was not looking for an Alien rehash.Could have gotten a 4 out of me if we'd just abandoned that needless sideshow.I will admit it continues in Danny's tradition of looking at the psychological effects of unusually harsh and unrealistic circumstances (ie: Zombies in 28 days later)But unlike 28 days later, we did not need a monster to pop up in this one. We had a dieing world and harsh environment enough without adding a slasher in the mix.This is no 28 Days later,."
4,For SONY Blu-Ray Players,"FYI - I just contacted FOX regarding their corrected Blu-ray version of Sunshine and they said Amazon's inventory has not been updated with the new version. If you want to buy it now, you can purchase directly from Fox, through FoxConnect.*Update - Oct 2012: The PIP problem with Sony blu-ray players has apparently been fixed on the current batch of blu-rays being sold on amazon. I received my copy roughly 2 weeks ago and the issue has been resolved. The disc was purchased directly from Amazon."
1,Crap-Can't turn off useless commentary,Great movie is wasted. T Here is NO way to turn off the totally irritating commentary picture in picture. have never seen this before on any DVD or bluray Sat down to watch the disk and thought I had screwed up until I did a ggogle search and everyone has this issue!
1,Sunshine Menu is Bad,"I bought this because I kinda like this movie even though it wasn't a big hit. The special effects are wonderful. My complaint isn't with the movie, it's with the design of the DVD interface. I have a Sony player, and when it plays you have the commentary with the film and no way to shut it off. I checked on the internet, and it said the disk is not compatible with some Sony players. Really? How do you make a menu, without the option to turn off commentary? There is no ""off"" button. Very disappointing that the makers of the menu could have been this careless."
3,So disappointed,"***spoiler****I don't think I've ever written a review on a movie before on Amazon, but I just have to vent. This movie is so incredibly amazing until the last 25 minutes. Maybe a top 5 fave for me until they completely ruin the atmosphere, drama and story about people sacrificing for the greater good. How do they do this? By inexplicably going supernatural with the leader of the previous ship sent on the mission becoming some sort of sun burnt sun god or some crap. What a joke. WHY!!! Why do this??? Couldn't he have still been himself, just warped in the mind? Why make him a supernatural creature of some sort. I have nothing more to say really, other than I feel so let down by such an incredible first few acts.Definitely the most letdown I've ever been during the course of viewing a movie."
3,Just Okay,"I bought this andFull Circleat the same time, I guess I was in a martial arts mood. I just couldnt get into this movie, it was so unrealistic and cheesy even for a movie! I loved Full Circle alot thank God, so it made up for it."
1,garbage,"what garbage. Nevermind that the movie doesn't bother to explain the premise (i.e. why are we suddenly in dire need to ""ignite the sun""?) there is absolutely NOO science and nowhere near a bare adequate amount of ""fiction"" in this. the actual plot is incomprehensible. as in... you are not going to ""get it"" EVER. there IS no plot. this is absolute garbage from start to finish. I didn't pay to see this and I STILL want my money back.unacceptable. there ARE no characters. There IS no idea. There IS NO PLOT. just random bits of random 2010 & 2001 quasi-nods. really, its kinda an insult. like do those ""hollywood"" types really think that we (the public) are dumb enough to be amused by this? at all???"
1,A minus 2 star rating!,"This was probably the awfullest movie I've ever seen. There is no plot, the dialog is forgettable (such as it is), the camera work was probably designed to hide a non-existent or low-budget set; besides that, it gave me vertigo; and scientifically, the idea that the movie was centered around was totally absurd.Imagine thinking that an atomic bomb - even one as ""big as the island of Manhattan"" - would have any effect on the sun (if it were dying) whatsoever. Obviously, the script writers had not a single clue about the sun, how it works, how big it is; geeze, that stupid ideas is like talking about a flea crawling up the back leg of an elephant with rape on its mind! Ridiculous!I can only say that I sat through it because I was having a foot massage..."
1,Did anyone else see the face flashing on the screen?!,"I actually thought this movie was mediocre for the first 45 min until randomly, a mans face flashed on the screen very quickly like a subliminal message. Then a few seconds later a womans face, then a different mans face again! I found this EXTREMELY DISTURBING. It didnt seem like it was supposed to be part of the movie although others have said it is. I dont understand why anyone would want to ruin a movie like that. Whoever thought that was a good idea is a moron. I was so startled, confused and annoyed that I had no urge to watch the rest of the movie. After reading reviews Im glad I didnt finish it!Awful Awful Movie."
4,SUNSHINE SHINES,I thought the movie was well done. The acting the direction the writting and the cg effects. If your a scifi fan check this movie out.
2,Sunshine Doesn't Make Me Happy,"Sunshine starts out with a lot of promise...interesting cast, great spfx...but soon devolves into a pointless thriller. I couldn't even finish it I was so bored. No wonder this mess was shuffled into and out of theaters in, like, one week. Shame on you, Danny Boyle. You can do better than this."
4,Glimmers of hope in the worst of circumstances,"It's a trademark of Danny Boyle's films to show humans clinging to hope even in the worst possible circumstances---just think of the ending of Trainspotting and 28 Days Later.Sunshine follows a similar pattern, with seven astronauts and scientists attempting to reignite a dying sun by means of a stellar bomb, thereby saving the Earth. That this could mean their own deaths is something that probably weighs on their minds as much as on the viewer's.The film will also put one in mind of Alien, with the confining space of the ship and the intimacy of a small group. There's even a nod to Silent Running, with the greenhouse/oxygen garden on board.The film might have benefited by the inclusion of some bits of backstory on these people and maybe some transmission from their families back on Earth. Overall, however, it is an intriguing story."
3,"Suffers from ""trailer-too-epic-for-its-own-good"" syndrome","Sunshine had an epic trailer that was impossible to live up to, especially considering that they wouldn't be able to use Clint Mansell's score in the film itself. The film is visually impressive and there are moments of beauty. I love the score. The premise is interesting - this is visionary stuff. Boyle also creates a claustrophobic atmosphere.It riffs offEvent Horizon (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)unfortunately, and the script doesn't make a whole lot of sense. At times where I was supposed to be engaged I was just confused. The director also made some strange artistic choices in the editing room. Ironically when it becomes silliest (crazy Christian pyscho-killer) is when I became most interested."
2,Bluray skipped at the last crucial scene,"I got this dvd pretty quick which I was really happy about, but when I finally got to watch the movie...well at the last part of the movie it skipped!! That was really disappointing..."
2,Save yourself !,"The beginning premise was good, however, the movie took a dramatic turn south during the last hour. In the end, Sunshine is light horror movie mixed with a few 2001 A Space Odyssey moments."
2,Dull sci fi,"This British made sci fi is really dull and boring. The plot: we are in the mid 21st century and the sun is running out of fuel. To prevent it from dying out and thus freezing the Earth to death, a multinational (and strangely all young and photogenic) team of scientists is assembled to be send in a spaceship to the sun, in order to drop a couple of atom bombs that, it is hoped, will reignite the star. Unfortunately, during the mission, many problems ensue. This film was made on an evidently cheap budget - not by itself a problem, if the movie was interesting, which is not. Still, there are a couple of really bizarre scenes here that may well be worth the price of admission - a man literally touching the sun with his hands?"
1,Disc will not play on MANY blu-ray players,I am not rating the movie because I cannot view the blu-ray disc I bought. The disc will not play on many blu-ray players because it contains copyright protection that is so new that some players can't read it. This is a clear case of greedy studios releasing product before the technology is ready to support it.
3,"Great Concept Movie, Thin on Character Development","What this movie's about, the story, the twists, all that I loved. Cool looking scenes, interesting concepts; a real 2001 Space Odyssey feel. Afterward I found myself thinking... none of the characters had any depth to them. They were largely predictable in their roles and unimaginative in their execution. The main character, Capa, hardly says a word. He's got an enemy and a friend amongst the crew and only a few scenes make that apparent. Mostly he seems a reluctant participant in the whole movie."
4,very good sci-fi,"Obviously there are a lot of differing opinions on the quality of this film, but I found it to be one of the best sci-fi movies in a long time. (Even though suspension of disbelief is required in order to believe that our civilization figured out a way to travel to the sun and can't figure out the foam chunk issue on the space shuttle...)"
2,"Too dramatic, too weepy, too bad.","If I had a better grip on what it was like to be a woman during the era in which this was written I would probably like this novel a lot more. But to be quite honest I found it to be almost unbearably boring and drawn out. It simply reeks of the style of the times, which was to so forcefully over dramatize everything that work now seems almost comical. The point of the novel was supposedly to show how Eyre was able to overcome the sexism of her time, but in the end it seems as though she gave in to the sexism and ended up getting lucky. The plot is weak, the characters are unrealistic, and the language is far too melancholy. I won't argue that it was progressive for its time, simply because of the fact it was written by a woman and openly spoke out against the sexism in society, but in our times I'm afraid the message has been lost in its tediousness and extremity."
5,great book,i liked this book very much but im a big jane austen fan so this was right up my alley. the only problem i had with it was the story line was very predictable. but oh well i enjoyed it anyway.
3,Grrrrrrrr!,"This is Howells's study of a family and how the disastrous love affair of one of the daughters (Ellen) affects them all. The major problem is that the characters are all appalling: none of them get or deserve any of our sympathy. Ellen falls in love with a man who abuses her and tries to take advantage of her family. But Ellen can't let him go, and the family refuses to force her to - so they take her to Europe to forget. There she meets another man who loves her. By this time, however, you're so fed up with them all that you hardly care. You just want to strangle these people for acting so dumb."
1,For Latinamerica it doesn't worth it,"The trilogy is a good one, I mean The heretic is a terrible movie but part I and III are really great movies, we all know them. The problem is that the description says Latin as a language so not sure how does it mean, is Latin like Spanish Latin or the Latin spoke like thousands of years ago?. But only part II which is the worst came with Spanish captions, the other two movies are only in English, maybe you are thinking ""but this guy is writing the review in English!!!"" the problem is that I purchased this for my brother... Epic fail!!!"
5,The Exorcist 3-Pack,"A must have for the Excorcist genre film collector. Its digital picture and sound are excellent and the behind the scenes bonuses are well worth it. Having the entire collection in one set is the best way to man your shelves, and having them handy for your entertainment.The movies are classics. Two thumbs up."
4,office 2003,THE BOOK IS VERY VERY USEFUL-EASY TO READ AND PRACTICE AND BECOME ACQUIETTENCE WITH OFFICE 2003 THANKS
3,"OK, BUT.....","The first problem is the booklet, it's not written that well. Secondly, there is a little too much slop in the 'chisel hole' for accuracy, you really have to pay attention to holding it consistently in the same position.Also, there is no indicator on the machine by which you could judge the correct angle of the blade you are sharpening, something that would have been really simple to add on.This is essentially an automated scary sharp system, and it pretty much works as advertised, maybe I'm being too nit picky?"
4,"Loops? yes, Jazz? I don't know...","The title of this by the way very nice album makes you expect something else. The jazz is more in the approach of sound, and in the overall feel. If you're looking for electronic music that's is not about crashing hard-drives (like the overrated Autechre) you'll enjoy this one for sure. Think of Arovane, or the more minimal electronic pieces by To Rococo Rot (or even Keith Jarrets Koln concert...although that is stretching it a bit!).This record is just another good example of the booming electronic scene in Europe."
2,Disappointing,"Oh how I want to like this album. I was intrigued by this album's comparisons to Kid606 and jazz in reviews, and curious what slicing-edge au courant electronica was up to. So imagine my disappointment to find that apparently we're still stuck in 1996, blippin' along quite onanistically to Oval and Mouse on Mars (with -- God forbid -- shades of Amon Tobin). Perhaps this album's subtle advances and generic charms would be more apparent to listeners whose aesthetic electron microscopes are set at a finer discernment than mine, I will allow that. I just find the sonic textures here no more different than a brown noise generator's output or a scratchy CD of ""Soothing Environments: Lightning Storm,"" and the jazz samples sound curiously like the ones bundled with [a software package].As for ""au courant electronica"" that I _am_ liking, I'd recommend Nobokazu Takemura and 4Tek for the adventure and unexpectedly gorgeous soundscapes I was hoping for from ""Loop-Finding-Jazz-Records."""
1,Mediocre 1950s Spanish Film,"This late 1950s Spanish film is a retelling of the Faust tale. This time, a devil with Jewish imagery (Fernando Fernan Gomez) makes a pact with an old lady who is rejuvenated in the form of Mexican film star Maria Felix (whose voice is dubbed by a Spanish actress, except when she sings a bolero by Agustin Lara). Maria Felix is very over-the-top in this film, the direction is undistinguished, and the production values are on the mediocre side (like in many 1950s Spanish commercial films). Worst of all, its boring. This is for diehard fans only and the Vanguard DVD of an old Spanish film is of characteristically poor quality."
2,Bad quality,"The quality is bad, bad. it was merely scanned off a VHS and there are even frames missing from some scenes."
3,mistaken identity,"This version (1956) with Maria Felix is in Spanish and is not the version of ""Customers who bought this item also bought Therese (1986) . . ."" which is the Polish film, Faustina (1994), the story of a nun."
5,Amazingly quick read. I couldnt put it down.,"I have read a lot of books, and this one will certainly rank up near the top of the list of my favorites. This book was recommended by a friend, and I have to say, it warmed several emotions. It was nearly impossible to put down. I highly recommend this, if you like suspense and intrigue."
5,"The Beautiful, Silent, Sentinels of Hawaii","This book, the only one of its kind, is a must for everyone who loves Lighthouses or the Hawaiian Islands!The photographs, both land and aerial, of the Lighthouses and the Hawaiian landscapes are breathtaking. Add to that the history of the Lighthouses and the insets of local floral and fauna, and you have an excellent guide to the Hawaiian Lighthouses or a picturesque, memory invoking experience, for everyone who loves Hawaii.The Lighthouse People, Robert and Sandra Shanklin, have done an excellent job on their first, full length Lighthouse book. I highly recommend it for your own pleasure or a gift."
4,Bought in preparation for Hawaii trip,"Bought for my dad, a huge lighthouse fan, before our Hawaii trip. Was interesting reading for him prior to the trip, but we didn't really use it once we got to the islands."
3,Fair to middlin'...,"Bought from a 3rd party seller & the 1st CD was messed-up (skips in last 5 bands or so). However, I was refunded the purchase price, which made things OK. And what I heard was not so hot. I'm glad that things happened as they did. I was most interested in Frederick Urrey, whom I love, in this performance. He soloed with Princeton Pro Musica when I sang with them in the early '90s...what a fine musician he is. Listen to any of his Bach or Handel! *JTQ."
1,Buyer Beware,"Being one of the most expensive 21-22 inch CRT monitors on the market, and from a highly respected source (NEC-Mitsubishi) I expected a better than average product. What I got...Monitor #1: ""Damaged CRT"" according to NEC tech-support. The CRT had 2 large dark areas on either side of center (4"" x 8""), with an especially bright diagonal area in the middle (3"" x 7"").Monitor #2: ""Damaged CRT"" according to NEC tech-support. This CRT has the same 2 large dark areas on either side of center, and the bright diagonal area in the middle, and they are worse than the first monitor. This monitor also ""flashes"" the entire screen every so often (sigh).Not sure if I will try for a third monitor, try another model, or another brand."
1,HORRIBLE DONT BUY,"I purchased these for my mother for Christmas and she wore them and her neck turned black. They came with what looked like a certificate of authenticity, but obviously if they were real, they wouldn't have turned her neck black."
4,"Inept Police, an insular community ignoring it's problems","Having lived in the N. Idaho/Spokane area for several years in the 90's, I was struck by the fact that the majority of the population chose to ignore the problems of drugs, gangs and more in their midst. So the fact that the SPD handled this case so incredibly badly, doesn't surprise me.Fuhrman's book is well documented and researched, and his detective experience served him well in this case. If only the SPD had listened to his (and the FBI's) suggestions, 9 women might still be alive.Highly recommended."
4,A Tortured Hero,"Mark Furhman may be racist and dishonest, but that does not affect his great detective skills and his excellent writing style. He has a keen insight to catching killers, and he is very observant to his surroundings. This is a great book, written by a not-so-great man, but he still deserves the respect as a good investigator. If you like suspense and action, read this book."
2,"Bad Cop, Terrible Writer","I have been a reader of true crime for several decades. This book was one of the worst written of them all. Redundancy abounds, and it asks more questions than it answers. A person would have to be terribly desperate for a story to waste time with this one. The only prevailing theme is Fuhrman's ego. He was never impressive as a cop, and he doesn't pass ""Go"" as an author. I say pass this one by."
2,Making murder boring,"What could be more exciting than a book about a recent serial killing case in my area? Lots of things. While Fuhrman takes an exhaustive look at the Spokane police and sheriff departments, the personalities in the law enforcement community and their failure to give this case the attention it deserved, I found the book seriously lacking substance. I wanted to know more about the victims and way more about the killer."
4,"Pictures, pictures, where are the pictures?","America's favorite detective, and deservedly so. Is rather hard on the Spokane Police, and plays the know-it-all, ""why doesn't anyone listen to me?"" role rather well. Eventually they DO get their man, but he was only killing drug-addicted street whores, so how much time should the Spokane PD devote to these slimy pigs anyway? After all, that's a dangerous occupation they have chosen, isn't it?But where are the pictures?A true crime case like this DEMANDS photographs; of the burial scenes, the cops, the victims, and of course, the serial killer himself, doesn't it?Still, a pretty good read."
4,Los Angeles lost a fine detective,"As a fan of non-fiction detective stories, I was very impressed by both the true to life shortcomings of the Spokane task force, and the solid knowlege of Mark Fuhrman. One can only wonder how many murders go unsolved because of ineptitude, pre-conceived notions, and politics. And how many innocent get imprisoned because of the same. Ranks up there with Lindergh the Crime and Fuhrman's Murder in Greenwich."
3,Fascinating,"Mark Furhman writes a fascinating account of how the hunt for the Spokane serial killer took place. As a former homicide detective he has some definite opinions on the manner in which the Spokane authorities conducted the investigation. He is highly critical of them and in many cases is probably correct. However, his ego often times gets in the way. Sometimes the timeline gets a little muddled as he jumps around in the narrative. It would be interesting if we had more of the police and sherriff depts points of view. Still the book is very fascinating."
3,Not His Best,A little tedious. I would have enjoyed the readers digest version of this crime. Too much detail for too long. Maybe incorporate where the suspect was in every other chapter. I still enjoyed it. I think Fuhrman was and still is an excellent detective. ...
1,Mark Furman does not belong in Spokane,"Mr. Furman makes clear that he has always longed to investigate a serial killer case. When the task force would not accommodate him by letting him join the investigative team, Mr. Furman chose to ""investigate"" the task force instead. The blistering and unrelenting attacks upon the detectives demonstrate Mr. Furman's pre-ordained objective in writing the book. Unfortunately, Murder in Spokane is short on facts, and long on speculation. It also is replete with Mr. Furman's egotistical ramblings about how he would have handled the ultimately successful investigation. In a bizarre twist, Furman contends that serial killers are extremely difficult to capture, but then criticizes the task force for not catching him sooner. The book is nearly impossible to finish because of Furman's speculative ramblings which cause the reader to nod off. Don't waste your money."
1,Murder in Spokane,"This has to be the poorest excuse of writing I've read in a long time. Mr. Furhman did nothing more than take a chronology of the deaths of these poor women and add his ""monday morning"" quarterbacking. I enjoyed Mr. Furhman's other books but this book was a great disappointment. If you REALLY want to read this, come to my garage sale and buy it for $.25 'cause that's all it's worth. Shame on me for spending a gift certificate on it and shame on Mr. Furhman for ""writing"" it."
1,terrible waste of time,"This book was terrible. Some have compared the author to Ann Rule...what a joke. Comparing Mark Furhman to Ann Rule is like comparing Ed Wood to Steven Speilburg. Actually, Furhman has writing ability but wasted it with page after page of second guessing the Spokene police. Even though a lot of it was with some justification, this is not why I bought the book. Very little was devoted to the seriel killer who preyed on Spokene area prostitues for years before he was caught. The purpose of of this review is not to honor the talent of Ann Rule, although it is considerabale, but Furhman could take a few lessons and do much more reseach into the backgroud of the killer. Perhaps I was expecting too much. I got way too little. Avoid this one."
4,Incompetence or inexperience?,"I thought the book was very good. I have read 2 books now by Mr. Fuhrman. I am not sure if the Spokane PD/Task force was just inexperienced or incompetent. After the first few bodies showed up being prostitutes, my first thought was why the police didn't set up surveillance at East Sprague with decoys also. They also seemed stubborn and afraid to involve other people because of embarrassment. I don't understand how Ted Bundy, The Green River Killer, and the Spokane killer could dispose of that many women before being apprehended. It's incredible. What are the cops doing up there in the Pacific Northwest? It takes 20 years and approx. 49 murders before a suspect is arrested in the Green River killings. The Spokane killer disposed of about half of that himself. Anyway, Mark raises some good points and this case could have been solved much earlier, saving many lives. I enjoyed it and can't wait until the next Fuhrman book."
4,I couldn't put this book down.,"I'm reading backwards...Murder in Greenwhich and the book on the O.J. Simpson murders are in my bookshelf, but I haven't yet read them.Although Mark Fuhrman has the ego of John Douglas, and though he really interfered obnoxiously in the police investigation, his descriptions of finding murder victims set my hair on end. I couldn't sleep the night I read it. I think Fuhrman is an excellent writer. Perhaps it's best he resigned his detective position. His details, research, thoughts were all quite excellent. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in true crime."
2,Not Your Typical True Crime Book,I was disappointed because we never got to know the criminal and the victims. It was all about Fuhrman's dissatisfaction with the investigation. His points were valid but it's not the kind of true crime I really enjoy.
5,Great charger,"Fast, reliable, tough, looks great, plenty of accesories.No better purchase you can do for this price."
1,Not worth your time,This is a recent set of very weak covers. Scratch has done much better work. Don't be disappointed- stick with his earlier material.
1,Learn to SWIM your drowning!,"Time to hang it up guys, the ersatz Pearl Jam/ Sound Garden, Wanna-be rock band is still in the struggling stage and needs a lot of work. By the time they the ever get noticed they will be too old to tour. If they are smart they would quit before they invest too much of their life they cannot get back. I have heard much better bands Magnitue 9(being one of them). By the way; what the hell is one of the band members doing leaving remarks blowing smoke up the fans butt, acting like they walk on water...Please!"
5,Very Cute!,"The tub o grub minus the tub, as ours came without the tub, is still awesome. The food has a nice durable texture and color. I had a plastic canister laying around so I just threw the food inside of there. Got it for my son for Christmas. He's gonna love it!"
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!,"not just ""off"" product- it's specifically ""Tropical Fresh"" scented one!!!!I only use this one even if I still like general off products.I used this(Tropical Fresh one) 2 years ago, and it was GREAT!Awesome! Marvelous! and Incredible!works great! I didn't have to deal with the mosquito bites, and on top of that- It smells AWESOME fresh floral scent! I usually don't like the stingy, yucky smell of the repellent of any kind- but this was just so refreshingly scented!when I used this product- it was orange colored- everything(labels)- not like the picture of this photo(lid's orange, and the label is more like pink).I don't know- it's been 2 years that the company might have changed the design or the color.I, myself, actually have been trying to find this product for last 2 years. However, walmart, target, smith's, drugstore, or any retail stores...didn't have it.I'm glad I could find this at Amazon!I definitely order this product- and use all summer long!!!!!!!!"
5,An introduction to the therapeutic value of story-telling.,I used one of the stories in the book to help my daughter with bedwetting and she was cured in a week. I have always known (and used) the power of metaphors (stories) in my teaching and so it was a delight to find a book that specifically addressed storytelling for children. The examples he gives in the book are great! This is a practical book. It reviews the work of Bruno Bettelheim and Milton Eriksson (the world experts on the value of storytelling) but you don't have to know about them to make good use of the book.
2,old info,"unless you're into pre 1988 autos, you want need this book. it has basic information, but you can get most of it free from wikipedia or a/c websites."
1,THE REAL TRUTH IS....THIS VIDEO IS NOT THE BEST,"Meet the Phonics is very confusing! I have purchase all the Meet the Sight Words videos and we love them. My son has learned a great deal and has shocked everyone who has worked with him. I thought it would compare are even be a better learning tool then the collection of ""meet the sight words"" for my son. It just did not work for us and we are huge fans of Preschool Prep, I rushed and brought both of the ""meet the phonics"" dvd's and I'm very disappointed. Wish I would have waited on reviews."
1,"""Wh"" sound is pronounce incorrectly","My four year already knows how to read and was very upset that ""Wh"" was mispronounced. The remainder of the DVD is well done, just one minor error. Nonetheless, I'm not showing this DVD to my 21 month year old. Complete accuracy is important. I recommend you buy ""Rock N' Learn Letter Sounds"" and ""Rock N' Learn Phonics"" instead, along with the Preschool Prep Sight Words DVDs."
2,Not as good as ~ Meet The Sight Words~,"I love the 3 MEET THE SIGHT WORDS DVD'S. However MEET THE PHONICS is not the best I wish I would have listen to the other reviews for both of the new Phonics dvd's. Meet the sight words was fun and engaging with colors and actions but,the sounds of the blends are pronounced but when you put the word together to make like ""change"" for example it not pronounced. It's a really strange dvd. I don't like it and I'm disappointed. Meet the sight words had such a great impact on my son's learning and reading them I just knew this dvd had to be perfect. Maybe this dvd is for an older group, but it's not working for us. I guess I will watch this one collect dust, because I cannot use it."
1,This book could be fatal to your finances.,"This book ignores the many valid reasons this is probably the worst time to buy a house ever. Of course, the author is a Realtor(TM), so you wouldn't expect a balanced account.For some good reasons not to buy, see http://patrick.net/housing/crash.html"
1,A Book for the Terminally Stupid,"Its obvious from the headlines today that this book is a load of manure. Exactly the opposite of the book's premise has happened. Funny thing is, its happened before and will happen again. Real Estate, like everything else, goes in cycles."
1,Awesome Book!,"Awesome Book! I totally agree with other posters on the historical signifigance. It has the same weight and dark humor aspects as Ernon's ""Code of Ethics"" Employee Handbook from 2000. Aside from the hilarious writing, the best part has to be the great cover illustration of the floating house... It's just out of reach...but maybe with an 80/20 Stated Income I/O loan package we can make it happen! Hooray!"
1,Paid Huckster Drums Up Business,"The question to ask with any advice book is whose interests does the author serve. Here, author David Lereah is employed by the National Association of Realtors. Let's think... whose interests does he serve? Yours or his EMPLOYER'S?"
1,A realtor wrote this book people COME ON!!!,"Anyone who buys a house right now in New England, the West Coast, and Florida is crazy. We are in a housing bubble and its just at the beginning right now. People always pay a price for excessive behavior. Whats fueled the bubble?.... speculators, mania, and relaxed lending institutions giving out crazy loans have fueled this housing bubble. With gas at 3.00 a gallon, interest rates rising, the American savings rate at 0%, and salaries declining, how can real estate go up anymore. It has one place to go and thats down. Don't buy this book and make this creep rich.[...]"
1,Waste of Time.,Yeah yeah. Guy employed by realtors wants you to keep lining realtors pockets.And this is informative how?
4,Good Book For 2nd Home Market Investors,"Lereah does a good job of linking the upside in broad housing markets to Baby Boomer influences. I agree that much of the 2nd home and resort real estate market will benefit from the boomer retirement phase. Boomers transformed every other aspect of American life along their path, so it's not hard to see an upside in resort/retirement real estate too.Easy read. Good financials for novice - mid level real estate buyers. Ignore his promoting of the realtor community. The process is just not that complicated and he overstates their importance/role."
1,Housing Boom did go Bust--guess he was way wrong!,"Let's see, the boom busted, what? Last year, and it's still sliding downhill.Here is a recent quote from Lereah himself from a May 6, 2008 Newsweek article about the housing market:""We're not at the bottom,"" he says. ""[People] want it to be near the bottom, but we're not there yet. The leading indicators are still very bad. Pending home sales are still in bad shape. Mortgage applications are low ... There's still supply out there in abundance ... This thing is going to get worse before it gets better.""And...""We're probably going to end up with a 20 percent [decline], but if I'm wrong it will be even more than that.""Well, since the title of his book is clearly shown WRONG by current events, it would be advisable to skip this boatload of malarkey."

1,Has this Guy (author) Changed His Name Yet?,"Has this Guy (author) Changed His Name Yet?......and moved to a different country? It is Dec. 2008 and we are in the midst of a housing crash unseen since Great Depression. This title belongs with ""Dow 36,000?"" as biggest load of rightwing mallarky ever printed."
1,Worst. Financial. Advice. Ever.,"Had a real estate agent give me this book at the height of the bubble -- fortunately I did not buy a house. This book from the then-National Realtor Association's chief economist remains a lesson in 2 things: don't believe everything you read, and don't follow advice from parties with a conflicted interest."
1,Very Basic Info-Lacks Depth,This magazine contains basic and simplistic info on nutrition you're seen elsewhere. Unless you're a beginner who has little knowledge and wants info at a very basic level-go elsewhere. It lacks any real depth. It also has a very inordinate amount of advertisements that makes up the majority of pages.
2,Disappointed in latest issue,"Like the one-star reviewer, I am not finding much content in this magazine - have only received a couple of copies so far, but the latest is filled with articles urging use of various supplements and extracts rather than healthy dietary plans (an article on how to lower cholesterol in particular completely ignores basic foods known to reduce blood fats). Additionally, an article on massage is accompanied by a provocative photo of a young woman that reminds me of what used to show up in ""men's magazines"". My ""Vegetarian Times"" is way more helpful with health planning. I'll be letting this subscription run out, and if there are many more pictures like the massage one I'll be getting a pro-rated refund."
1,Junk Magazine,"This magazine has very low quality content. The articles in the magazine are simple, anecdotal and contain very little useful information. The stories contain little snippets from books and other articles but never get into anything in depth. They don't seem original at all. The magazine is also laden with advertisements for Hydroxycut, supplements, and other associated junk science items. So much for ""natural health."" I would pass on this magazine."
5,"If you love Celtic mysticism, this one's for you!","The perfect book for all those who cherish their Irish-Catholic and/or Scottish heritage!A look at the ""Auld Lands"" through the stories of various priests that pass through the parlor of a lapsed Catholic woman, who scandalizes her family and neighbors.The stories celebrate Gaelic mysticism, old time religion, and even the die-hard cussedness of the Celtic spirit, shining through the early 20th century.The men hope to re-convert their hostess (while enjoying a sumptuous meal and some excellent spirits!), but she may just be the most cussed of them all. A wonderful period piece that's colorful, funny and sometimes poignant, but never dull."
4,"a classic: if that's positive or negative, it's up to you","This cd is a classic within the EBM-industrial-whateveryoumaycallit genre; The style was already defined, though, and if you don't believe it, just listen to DAF's trilogy, Front 242's first albums or Die krupps' 'Volle Kraft Voraus'; However, Nitzer Ebb helped to give strength to this style of music, a style which has pleased my ears throughout my years listening to music. Tight rhythms, repetitive beats, minimalistic sounds, screaming voice military style,... 'Join in the Chant' or 'Let Your Body Learn' are today considered classic hits in industrial music. In my opinion, Nitzer Ebb, together with a bunch of bands, gave a bit of dignity to the underestimated panorama of the 80's, so loaded with bad bands such as Spandau ballet, Modern Talking... What a pity Nitzer Ebb splitted with just 5 cds. But THAT TOTAL AGE, even if not being their best, still rules!"
4,Good ol' dance classics here....,"""Murderous"" & ""Join in the Chant"" are a couple of tracks off of here that I've heard frequently in clubs, and are definitely classic club songs. I've also heard ""Let your body learn"", but not as much. With catchy drumbeats & pounding bass, this is good to dance or drive to, & MUST be cranked loudly. Personally, as an album, I prefer 'Belief' (the one after this) over this one, but it's still good. Another good idea is mixing these tracks in with other 80's dance tracks to break the monotony a little."
3,Tough album to review,"On the one hand, it has brilliant work like ""Murderous,"" ""Let Your Body Learn, and ""Join in the Chant."" Everything else is double-time and/or crap (as in, it's not danceable or particularly listenable). Nitzer Ebb is a ""must"" band for this type of music but don't assume it's all equally relevant or accessible - it's not. Front 242 is much more consistent."
3,[N][E],"Nitzer Ebb have great energy. Synth with a slightly harder edge. Orchestrated noise with good BPM. This is old school now, but it still is fun. Saw them with Depeche Mode once, cool concert. ""Violent Playground,"" ""Join In The Chant,"" ""Murderous,"" are a few of my favorites."
4,...To the left...to the left...,"Just another title that every industrial music listener should have in their collection. A sound that reminiscent of of Depeche Mode's 'Some Great Reward', and a little early Ministry. Just buy the damn album."
1,not worth the effort,"Well, after listening to a few Nitzer Ebb releases, I decided to purchase one that I hadn't heard. I bought this one. Obviously, there are quite a few people who hold this CD in high regard, but sadly, I'm not one of them. Realizing that this album was recorded in 1987, I had to think of the period of time and the other music being recorded at the time. So with that, I have found that this CD is too minimalistic for my tastes. Compared with ""industrial"" music being produced around the same era, this CD is too monotonous with regards to the speed and the similar synth basslines for my tastes. I do credit Nitzer Ebb with showing a lot of attitude on this release, but it still falls short in my mind for the era."
2,Highly overrated - empty and meaningless,"It just is.I recall when this came out in '87 and it was in all the clubs. I bought a copy and played it to death but then I slowly realized that while other industrial bands had a message and some substance to go along with their beats - Nitzer Ebb weren't really saying anything. It's a bunch of shouting and yelling of words that sound aggressive but they really don't mean much.Compare them to lyrics from Front 242, Laibach, Front Line Assembly, etc. and you'll see that NE were yelling but not saying anything. After a while they get a bit annoying really. I sold my copy a long time ago.Their dance beats on this CD/record get repetative as well. Not that repetition is bad - it's just within the same record I don't want to hear essentially the same tune twice with different lyrics.As for their popularity as ""proof"" of their greatness - Britney Spears was popular too."
5,Lousy sound quality,"Maiden is one of my favorite bands, but this is a lousy CD. The sound quality is significantly lower than that of ""Live After Death."""
4,Iron Maiden's newer material at full force!,"In this album Maiden combine their post Adrian Smith work with their late 80's classics and show that they are still as alive and exciting as ever. Hearing this material live showed me that their new material fits in quite well with the classic line-up stuff, and that they were (and are) still the greatest metal band ever."
1,HOW ??,"How can someone say that this is good ? It has some good songs included (one of them not being the awful WASTED LOVE - one of the worst Maiden songs ever, along with THE APPARITION and WEEKEND WARRIOR - by coincidence, all of them having the hand of Janick Gers on composition...), but the playing and mixing is just atrocious !!"
5,Delicious recipes that cut calories but not taste,"This beautiful duet of menu and music is superb! World renouned spas share tantalizing recipes easy enough for a novice cook to make. I especially like ""Tarragon-Walnut Wild Rice Salad with Chicken"" recipe from the Cal-A-View Spa in California.The CD music is equally ""light"" and sensational piano music composed by Chopin, Debussy, Ravel and Satie. I've tried trhe Milk Toner for Sensitive Skin given in the section ""Homemade Spa Treatments"" and it works. Also, this makes a great gift for a new bride."
1,Made From Cheap Metal from China,"We bought this grill about 3 years ago and yes it did cook very well. Unfortunately, I am now faced with replacing all burners and flame spreaders because of rust and heay fatigue. Yes we use our grill a lot but I have never seen such rust/corosion on any other grill I have owned. In fact, one of the screws that holds the rotisserie in place to the back wall of the grill popped loose. It appeaars that the head of the screw rusted or heat fatigued and it just popped loose. To fix it would require tapping out the old screw and erplacing it.I just priced out all the parts that need to be replaced and it comes to over $300. Since so much has failed on it I plan to pitch and but something that is NOT MADE IN CHINA (if I can).My advice is, although it looks great and cooks well, it will not last. Buy a better brand!"
5,21 oz milled face,i bought this hammer at a local ace on sale.i`ve used estwing in the past.but this hammer really is a different animal.not only do you not have to swing with as much force but once you get used to the feel it almost falls on the nail naturally.i`m used to california style handles so it took getting used to and i bent more then a few nails trying to hammer with my normal force.but once i did i realised i was`nt using my arm or shoulder nearly as much and i could use it a lot longer and it was`nt as tiring as my DEAD ON 21 OZ cali.i let a buddy borrow it for a day when his hammer was M.I.A. and he bought one the next day.only thing i miss is no nail holder for the odd angled shots.i`ve talked to some who HATE these hammers and some who LOVE them.i LOVE mine.but hold it and see if its right for you.the guy at the store that i bought mine let me try it out on some scrap he had and i was sold.
5,Best Hammer I've ever used,I was working on my house and was recommended this hammer buy a firend of mine. This hammer makes it easy to swing and you don't have the arm/shoulder pain that you get from other hammers. The weight forward makes this hammer hit with more force and less impact on my body. I recommend this Estwing hammer to everyone! It's worth the money!!!!
2,Hammer,"I don't like the hammer, it does not have the striking power of other estwing products i have. The balance is just ok, but the impact comes right back to your hand."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"The hammer shown is a square head, which is what I wanted.The hammer I received has a ROUND head.your description is inconsistent with the product you are selling (in the picture)Thanks,"
5,Beautiful harmonies,"The light, lyrical quality in their voices will lift your spirits, and the songs they've chosen mix history, story telling, and the spectrum of emotions. Whenever I play this recording, people ask where they can buy a copy."
2,"Too hard for beginners, not deep enough for experts","This book lacks structure, details and an editorial hand. You can buy better, cheaper."
1,To be very critical... This book stinks!,"The only thing this book is useful for is reference. Even then, it's very poor reference. The code samples are full of errors and inconsistencies. I would not recommend this book. You can get better learning and reference material online."
5,"Great for cracks, crevices, electronics","I LOVE these dust mitts, but I can't find them! Maybe P and G doesn't make them anymore? They're great for cracks and crevices and electronics. I hope I can find them soon!"
3,not as effective as other Swiffer products,"Pros:1) Made from the same highly-effective material that the regular Swiffer dust cloths are made from and they do their job well. They pick up dust particles that you can't even see!Cons:1) If your hand can't fit in between those blinds, inside a vase, and between the DVD player and the cd player, then neither can the mitt when it's on your hand! For this reason, I buy the new ""Swiffer Dusters"" instead. They get EVERYWHERE! If Amazon sold them, I would rate them five stars!2) They are effective on most surfaces *except* I have noticed that they tend to get snagged on rough surfaces such as unsanded wood and my stone fireplace3) They are hard to find, be it in stores or here on Amazon. I'm wondering if perhaps Swiffer even makes them anymore?I am a big fan of Swiffer products, but theses are definitely my least favorite."
4,I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!!,"I laughed, I cried, I was startled and surprised as I breezed through every chapter in Mr. Moore's first great novel.When I reached the end of one chapter, I could not stop and take a break. I wanted to find out what happened to all of the characters.I hope that there will be a continuation to this story in the near future. Mr. Moore has a bright future ahead of him as an author and I have already become a faithful fan."
5,Great View to Learn History of Classical Music,This CD is one of the Music Masters series of classical music history. I highly recommend it. Great value for the money. This will primarily be used for homeschooling.
5,just what I needed for work,"Simple tool for what I do at work. I perform basic lock work, and was looking for this paticular tool at a fair price."
4,For rekeying kwikset in-knob locks its the tool,"This is the tool for re-keying kwikset knobs (i.e. not deadbolts). Getting the cylinder out of the knob is difficult without this tool and easy with it. There is really no substitute for this slim piece of metal when removing the cylinder from a kwikset knob.BEWARE======There are generic kwikset (KW-1) knobs that can *NOT* be rekeyed, even with the tools. The cylinders are fused into the knob and will not come out. These are typically $5 knobs you run into on low-bid jobs. THE ONLY WAY TO GET AROUND THEM IS REPLACE THEM WITH A KWIKSET BRAND KNOB. I've encountered these permanent knobs twice - both were low bid jobs and were installed by the contractor with change keys inserted, then I was called to master all the units. Having spent way too much time on the first knob discovering there was no way to rekey it I re-bid the project.So long as you don't have one of those cheapie knobs you are fine with this tool and a KW-1 knob."
4,Simple tool,"The tool is easy enough to use, although the instructions might not be clear to some people. You remove the center shaft from the handle after lining it up and pressing a tab, and then you slide this tool into the hole where the shaft was. The cylinder falls out.The only question is why they don't include this with the lock sets. It's a simple piece of metal and you need it if your cylinder is upside down. Kwikset will send you one for free if you ask them, and you should get it within days."
4,"The kit worked, only modest skills needed if you watch the video","My silcock leaked massively when it was shut off and I have ordered this kit to solve the problem. I found a video on the Prier website that should very helpful, since there are no real instructions, just a tiny diagram and some notes on determining which model silcock you have. After watching the video the job will be straightforward. (I previously tried to put a link to the video here but to no avail. Try the Prier website (Amazon doesn't allow posting of links) and you should be able to find it.The kit itself worked. It contains parts for both the right-hand threaded and left-hand threaded versions. Obviously, you don't need the parts for the version you don't have.Note that Prier acquired Mansfield, that is why a search of Mansfield doesn't yield any product support websites!"
5,Everything you need is here,"This kit has all the parts to repair a failing sillcock. There are two varieties, and parts for both varieties are here, so you won't use all of them. The diagrams on the back are small and kind of crude, but there's enough info to do a successful fix. Just lay out the parts as you disassemble the stem and replace with matching parts from the kit."
3,Parts fix the drip,Arrived in a week and the replacement parts fixed the leak. Link to video was very helpful. Went together in five minutes.
4,Hydrant rebuild kit,"Good product, fast shipping, fixed the hydrant. All that was needed was two parts out of the dozen provided. Seems a waste to have that many parts left over, especially when you pay for all the extras not needed. Can not find the parts anywhere else. Lowest price that I found though."
3,replacement parts,The parts seem correct and fit right for the faucet as described. Replaced the parts but still have a leaky faucet. Should be 0 stars for the Mansfield outdoor hydrant.
2,sooooo dry,"This series is soooooo dry. It does give plenty of information on the composers and includes excerpts of their music. But even being a degreed music educator, I myself found it completely uninteresting. Way to bore them to tears! There has to be a better series. You might be able to stomach it if you were an adult or older teen but even then only when you HAD to. Works like this are why people think music history is borrow. What a shame."
2,Would Not Buy These Again,"I thought i would try a set of these after using Ernie Ball and Dean Markley for years..not again!These come packed with 2 strings to a sleeve 1&4,2&5,3&6..some way they had a wound 3rd in the pack for the 1&4 string which i didn't notice until they were on and wondering why i couldn't get it in tune.I had a unwound for the 3rd and wound 3rd for the 4th string.The 4th wound string snapped after it was on,a few minutes laterI would not take a pack of these again for free,any string that has instructions and precautions on how to put them on should give a clue."
4,Good substance but wordy,"Epitomy: Wordy, somewhat outdated, but has good observations and advice.Although published in 2001 (the copyright date in my copy is actually 2002), it appears to me that this book was written a few years earlier, perhaps in 1997-1998, and not brought up to date. I found it to be mostly well thought out and historically informative, citing many examples both of successful and of failed business strategies and practices. In my opinion it gives excellent strategic advice to anyone who is an employee or entreprenure in any kind of business -- i.e. it makes good points that should be useful to most of us. It was interesting to compare the predictions made so long ago with the actual outcomes in some instances.Nevertheless, I found the text to be not well written/edited: the style is rather rambling (boring) at times. Although it is a small book (especially considering the list price...), still I found myself wishing that it had fewer words."
4,A stones throw from Hot Tuna.,"If you like blues, and you liked Hot Tuna, this is a CD you want in your collection."
5,"Jorma's first solo release, and possibly his best.","Jorma Kaukonen has long been one of my favorite guitar players/inspirations. He is a master at finger picking the blues on the acoustic guitar. I enjoyed his early work with Hot Tuna, but lost interest in them when they decided to move towards more of a hard rock sound. However, Kaukonen's first solo effort was a return to his acoustic blues roots, and I was immediately won over again. This disc offers an outstanding remastering of that original solo album, and adds some great new tracks. I especially enjoyed the new tunes ""No Mail Today"" and ""Barrier"". If you are a fan of early acoustic Hot Tuna, or Kaukonen's more recent acoustic works, do yourself a favor and pick up this disc, you will not be disappointed."
5,Earthship music,A quite impressive collection of acoustic music from one of the pioneering guitarist of the 60's. Very peaceful addition to my archive of psychadelic music... Farther!
5,Jorma's First and Best,"When Jorma went out on his own, who would have know that he would create the best of his solo efforts first time out! Leaning heavily on the Rev. Gary Davis, Kaukonen turns in an acoustic masterpiece. The gentle music and lyrics will stick with you for years. This is one of my few ""go to"" albums, something I know I can always turn to no matter my mood."
2,Drugged feeling,"I've taken the other LEF dosage forms for melatonin, but this one made me so weird feeling in the morning! Will be going back to the regular capsules."
3,Worth the price for a couple of fantastic tunes:,"""Prison Blues"": Absolute blooooze; very slow, great singing by Chris Farlow with Page doing his usual Page-esque, dirty bends and cramming fills. And the great song ""The Only One"", featuring Jason Bonham and Robert Plant on drums and vocals, respectively.Some can take or leave the other cuts on the album, but bear in mind this 1988 effort featured a theretofore unheard-of collaboration between Page and Plant, and excellent drumming by Bonham's son. Some of you might remember: In the late 80s, this was incredible--nobody thought there'd be a coming-together of these talents again after Zeppelin disbanded."
2,Uneven Effort from Page,"This album contains some fine instrumentals like Writes of Winter, Liquid Mercury and Emerald Eyes that succeed in capturing the power, mystique and musical sophisitication of Led Zeppelin. Unfortunately, these tracks are outweighed by bland 80's hard rock drivel like Wanna Make Love and cheesy blooze rock filler like Prison Blues. Jason Bonham, lacking the subtlety and dexterity of his late father, fails to impress as does Robert Plant in his guest appearance on The Only One. John Miles is a better vocalist than Chris Farlow, but that's not saying much. Worth owning if you are a diehard Page fan, but the casual Zep fan should probably pass."
4,Solo Page,"I first got this on vinyl in the 90's second hand. Still trying to find my musical taste so to speak, but always liked Led Zeppelin, Sabbath, Purple. This is not a Led Zeppelin album!What it is - is a diverse mix of where Page came from and where he was heading - with a few throw backs to the blues which he loves - me too! It's also not like the Coverdale/page CD he does years later.I still play a few licks off this album on guitar which I ripped off and incorporated into my style years back - almost a how to play blues CD!There's a couple of songs that are so so, but for the most part I really enjoy the album. I hadn't listened to it for about 10 years until I got the new CD and was blown away again by how strong the songs and playing are.Personal favs are Wasting my Time, The Only One (With Robert Plant), Liquid Mercury and Prison Blues. Think of Knebworth with Plant/Page - thats a bit what this sounds like."
2,Not happening - For fan's only!,Boring. I love Zep and most of what Jimmy has done but this one didn't end up in bargain bins for nothing. Move on!
1,very disappointing,"The issue with respect to Page's Outrider album is not whether it sounds like LZ, but whether it's any good on its own. Which, sorry to say, it generally is not. Aside from one or two good cuts, it's largely unlistenable. God knows I've tried. One keeps thinking -- is is really this bad? And the same answer comes back every time -- yep. 'tis. There's a reason it's selling for $1.58 in Amazon's used bin. Let me make an analogy. When I was in grade school, they used to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with butter on them. Gross. Why ruin a perfectly good sandwich? Dunno. Why did Page put out this cd when he so clearly is capable of great playing? Dunno. It's inexplicable."
1,turn down the overdrive,"Jimmy Page is all over the guitar here, but the writing stinks. The vocals, the engineering that's like driving nails into your ears--I'd rather hear two gerbils run up and down a Strat with a bent neck and strings about to snap.If you want latter day Jimmy Page, check out ""Live At The Greek"" with The Black Crowes as a backing band or his duos with Robert Plant. There's a reason ""Outrider"" is selling for 3 1/2 bucks."
1,Typical Bar music,"I got this album yesterday only to find it so dissapointing. I love his guitar playing but the songs are terrible. Especially ""wasting my time"" and ""wanna make love"" This is the type of music I would hear in a bar or a classic Rock radio station. The music was sickening, uncomfortable and horrible. page could've done so much better. Him and Plant need to make an album that would blow fans away and they haven't done that. If you're a true jimmy page fan, don't buy this album. it's a waste"
2,"Good guitar playing, bad vocal tracks.","Jimmy Page's guitar playing on this album is pretty good. However, it wasn't laid out pretty well. The vocal tracks on each songs were laid out very poorly. The instrumental tracks were pretty good. The vocalists on this record except Robert Plant were terrible. Robert Plant's vocals on ""The Only One"" wasn't at his best. Jason Bonham's drumming were pretty good. He played pretty much the same technique his father, John Bonham did. The bassists on this record weren't very good either. Overall, this record is very disapointing. If you're a true Led Zeppelin fan, you'd be very disapointed with this record."
4,this album proved there was life in page's veins.,"It had been over ten years gone (presence) since we heard an unadulterated Jimmy Page album. while outrider may be uneven, and some of the guest musicians inappropriate, Page himself was in fine form musically and professionally. this was an assured and masterful return from skid row. we see the fruits of those labors now in the reformed Page/Plant, whose live shows captivate."
2,What Is and What Should Never Be,"This album does show off Page's awesome guitar skills, but with an 80's rock style. Guest appearances of Robert Plant and Jason Bonham are treats, but if you are looking for this album to sound like Led Zeppelin, you are out of luck. Even though this album lacks the Zeppelin feel, one song, Prison Blues, does resemble the classic guitar style Page uses with such songs as Bring it on Home and You Shook Me. A must for Jimmy Page fans, but not a necessity for Led Zeppelin fans."
2,Sinking Like A Led Zeppelin...,"I purchased this cd a few years back, but only got around to listening to it the other day. Why did I wait? I don't know. It was just filed away in my collection. When I finally got around to fishing it out, I expected no less than some great songs and cool guitar riffs. I was to be disappointed. One of the things that brings this record down is the 2 featured vocalists, John Miles and Chris Farlow. Both are competent vocalists, don't get me wrong. Page shouldn't have let them write their own lyrics. I have never heard so many rock cliches on a single album. Most of the songs sound formulaic. Page sounds like he is bored. This cd gets a 2 star rating instead of one just for The Only One. This is a track that features Robert Plant on lead vocals. It isn't the greatest Plant/Page collaboration, but it is the one saving grace on the album."
2,Why Jimmy Why,"I love Led Zeppelin zeppelin, And i love jimmy page, so when i saw this album, I clicked buy in a second.But i can't lie to you and say buy this album, because It really is bad, and very repetitive,Try John paul jones's solo effort zooma, or Robert plant's mighty rearanger for quality.Jimmy has a new album coming soon, Let's hope he puts out some quality music, Like the page we know and love."
4,Great Diapers,"These are the best diapers!!!! Nice and cushy. Only one tiny down fall supposed to fit up to 15 pounds, my daughter is 12 pounds and is already out growing them."
5,Best for any baby,"I had my second baby girl 6 weeks ago. We tried Huggies new born diapers in the Hosptial. After we got back from the hospital - my baby started off with serious diaper rashes. I got Pampers - and the rash disappeared in a day. The diapers are so good that the lining inside keeps the baby dry.For my older kid - I exclusively used Huggies - but now I can see the difference in quality and I would suggest Pampers to Huggies, forget any other local / cheaper brand.Its worth the extra dollars to keep your baby dry, healthy and happy :)"
5,online mama,"I loved these pampers, apart from 3-4 occasional leaks I have nothing to complain. They are soft and nice on baby's skin and the capacity is amazing!"
5,Great Diapers - Worth the few extra Bucks!!,"I have been using Pampers Swaddlers since my baby was a month old and they are the greatest diapers.I had received so many different brands of diapers from my baby shower - Huggies, Luvs, Store Brands, etc. and then I bought some Pampers Swaddlers on my own.The Pampers Swaddlers are so much better in quality compared to the others that it's unbelieveable. The quality of the material is so much nicer for baby's skin and the diapers just offer a more perfect fit than all the others out there. The diapers stretch and give for a comfortable fit - which reduces leaks and messes during those ""explosive"" poopies!I see why people buy the others - they are slightly cheaper than Pampers Swaddlers - but after using these diapers - I don't mind spending the extra $7 bucks per case. Amazon.com offers nice bulk cases and it works out to be only a few cents extra per diaper - and to me it's worth it."
5,Great Value,I received this in 3 days and i can't find this qty. in stores in my neighborhood and it's a great bargain. It really helps on saving diaper costs!
5,"a great place to start, and to linger...","Bill Kauth, co-founder of the wonderful New Warrior Training Adventure, has written an excellent resource for Men's Work. The processes and context presented here far surpass in depth and healing power most of what I was taught in my master's (social work) program. Men's Work is, first and foremost, about owning our Gold and Shadows. I am grateful to Bill Kauth for his long years of effort toward this liberating goal.Anyone who thinks this stuff is too 'touchy-feely' or not worthy of a real man's attention has obviously never done these processes. They reveal our depths, and many men spend their lives trying to run away from the vistas within. Have some balls and take the risk."
5,Mankindproject.com & Shiftmen.com used this book,"Mankindproject.com , shiftmen.com and countless other organizations have used this step by step primer to create safe functional men's groups. The down to earth language that Bill Kauth uses is clear and to the point. As Kauth along with Rich Tossi, and Ron Herring founded MKP, it is no coincidence that men who have completed the Mankind Project's ""New Warrior Training Adventure"" weekend will find a striking similarity with the handbook offered to them to support their world wide community of ""I-groups"" (men's circles).If you want a copy of ""A Circle Of Men"", Google Bill Kauth and let him know that it's time to have an E version of his book on Amazon."
3,Old News,"As a New Warrior entering the final phase of his Integration Group experience, I bought this book to use as a source for group exercises. I was disappointed to learn that there are few exercises fully explained in the book that we haven't already covered in the first two cycles of the I-group. There is a comprehensive list of ideas for group exercises but that hardly seems worth the price of the book. We all have ideas, but what is needed are practical and in-depth suggestions for their implementation. I would recommend this book only to men who are not involved with the New Warrior Training Adventure. If you are a New Warrior, you will experience in your I-group everything this book has to offer, so save your money."
4,Loved it then... wish I had it now.,Got this when it came out. It rocked. Wish I still had it. Good rock songs never go out of style. If you like GOOD '80 rock/metal. Check it out. If you were into the fly-by-night hair bands... forget it.
5,One of the Greatest Albums NEVER Heard!,"Contagious is an exceptional hard rock album that was, and still is, completely overlooked by the mainstream consciousness. The title track ranks right up there with Y&T's best. This is one tight song with thumping drums, crisp guitar riffs and a resonating chorus. Other highlights include Fight For Your Life, a powerfully personal anti-drug song, and Bodily Harm, which flat-out rocks. This album is solid from start to finish. If your looking for some great guitar work, which is a lost art on today's metal bands, then look no further than Y&T. Overlooked, under-rated and unlucky - Y&T never received the credit they deserved."
2,Nothing past the title track,"Look, I'm probably one of the bigger Y&T; fans you'll meet. I have long asked for more of the band's A&M; recordings to be re-released in the U.S., and have on many an occasion considered Y&T; the single most underrated band in the history of metal. But bands put out good and bad albums, and ""Contagious,"" which others have noted is Jimmy DeGrasso's first album and Joey Alves' last with the band, is not all that good.""Contagious"" starts well with the title track, but from then on, there's really not much. ""The Kid Goes Crazy"" is another of those comic tracks, like ""Barroom Boogie"" before it, but doesn't quite live up to the standard. The rest is filler, plain and simple, though Dave Meniketti shows how much soul a guitar can put out at the end with ""I'll Cry For You.""Download the title song. Skip the rest."
3,Energetic and fun.,"Contagious is a cool and listenable album from Y&T. I've had this disc in my collection for quite some time. The album is in a mainstream hard rock musical direction. The musicianship, songwriting, and production are good. Contagious is energetic and entertaining from beginning to end. The guitar work is solid. Dave Meniketti does a lively job with the vocals, also. Ten tracks are included on this album. Almost all of the songs are straight-ahead hard rockers. There's also one ballad (""Temptation"") and an instrumental (""I'll Cry for You""). The backing vocals throughout this disc are cool. Some of the tunes that I like are ""Contagious,"" ""Temptation,"" ""Armed and Dangerous,"" and ""I'll Cry for You."" ""Contagious"" is still a good and energetic song--the guitar riff is pretty nice. ""Temptation"" is an enjoyable ballad, and ""I'll Cry for You"" is an impressive instrumental. Contagious is a solid, fun, and energetic album from Y&T. It's worth a listen."
4,Yeah!!!!,"This album is one of my favorites by Y&T. I enjoy Y&T's earlier releases but this one really is a tasty, album. Dave and the boys do very well on this one."
2,Semi-great Y&T,"Buy it for ""Contagious"" & ""L.A. Rocks."" I give this one 2 stars because these 2 songs are the only good ones on the CD. The title track is one of the the top 5 best songs ever by Y&T. The video for that one was great(wish I could see it again)."
2,what happened to y&t?,"where did dave go? This cd is a hollow shell of a band that used to sound original.This particular album is clearly the product of fancy production and record company b.s! Without their original lineup, they've clearly displayed just how far a band can fall!But hey!,, my dog is getting very good at catching it as his new frisbee! Let's try this one again o.k. boys?"
3,"Extended, but dry","This library reference is very extended, up-to-date and cover every aspects of Python's modules ( string, regular expressions, ...). The division in themes ( Maths, Internet, ...) and in order of usefulness makes it easy to learn and get important information. The index and the table of contents make it very easy to find the appropriate method to perform a particular task. In addition, the style is concise and the presentation clear.Nevertheless, this is only a reference : The examples are rare and insufficient to learn efficiently the language, unless you need'nt examples to learn all about a new language.Therefore, this book should be used as a reminder or a quick finder, i.e. a reference book."
5,coffee beans,I like this company. Fair trade coffee is important to me and I want to deal with a company that believes the same thing. It doesn't hurt that the company is located in the same state as I am. I would strongly recommend this company.
2,I never really got it,"I am a big GG fan and I appreciate that they were experimenting all the time. However, just because something is musically innovative doesn't mean it is enjoyable. I tried for YEARS to like listening to this album because I knew it was clever. It is like trying to enjoy brussel sprouts because you know they are good for you. Sad truth is I try each about once every few years and then remember quickly why it had been a long time since I tried them last."
3,"Muddy Production, But Good Progressive Rock","This release suffers greatly from a muddy/muffled production value [much like ""Nursery Cryme"" by Genesis from the same year], but still manages to have its moments. The first track, ""Prologue"" is the best, in my view. Other tracks are much less melodic -- something that would be much stronger on the group's next release, ""Octopus."""
1,Terrible Gentle Giant CD,I must have been out of my mind when I purchased this CD. I purchased Octopus at the same time and that is an awesome CD. The three friends cd is a little off. Missing Piece is a fine piece of work but it is difficult to find. I don't recommend this CD unless you worship Gentle Giant.
1,I Don't Get It,"-I don't know. I love GG, and many of their albums are perfect.But this one, I can't wrap my head around it.It's too simple, and a big step down from AQUIRING THE TASTE.Alot of people love it, so maybe it's me.But, IMHO there's only one good song here. Not enough to make me spend my hard-earned money.-"
4,Thank God for Rosand,"If Aaron Rosand was not around, I wonder if any of these obscure romatic compositions would ever get their due? Fortunately, Rosand has been out there for decades, championing music that everyone else seems to ignore.Most of the composers on this albums are well-known, but not for these pieces. Some composers, like Goldmark & Svendsen, have unjustly fallen into obscurity. However, just because you may never have heard of the piece or the composer does not in any way take away from the quality of the music or the performance.It helps also that this CD is dirt cheap! When a CD cost so little, it is hard to complain about the sound quality not being quite up to par. Personally, it is something I can live with."
5,Excellent Fighting Reference!,"There are a few things that Simco does as an instructor that *most* others in BJJ don't.He was the first to come out with a book that breaks BJJ down into which techniques worked best for different sports. If you want the Bible of BJJ, go get the Master Text. If you are looking for just the Vale Tudo side, this book is great because it will show you what moves you should be concentrating on for that type of thing.The book is broken down into positions and this makes it easy to reference.The main pictures are large and clear with accompanying exploded versions where needed, he then places all the pictures in the form of thumbnails on the sides of the first page where the technique starts for easy referencing or quick overview.The DVD is also excellent. I have most of Simco's previous work, so I wasn't expecting anything new, I just got the book to check out the DVD, which was worth the fair price I paid online."
1,They don't serve,"They don't serve. I buy these shoes but i'm disillusioned i just used them for 20 minutes and the right one starts to emit a sound like when you open a door ""uink,uink"", don't buy this product. I lose my money"
5,WOW!,"I don't know about the book, but this is the hottest cover I have ever seen! I'm going to buy two copies."
4,Better than its cover,"Arguably this novel has the world's most atrocious fantasy cover painting ever. I haven't seen a cover this schlocky since about 1974.I hope the cover doesn't drive people away from the book, which is really clever, captivating, and funny (without being cloying). There's good dramatic tension between the characters and a worthwhile plot line that builds on (and is really more adeptly handled than) the plot of the first book in the series.I look forward to reading Briggs' next book -- this one was good, and I think she's steadily improving. But, gah, her editor really needs to find her a more appropriate cover artist."
5,Amazing story,Loved it. In fact I make an effort to 're read this series at least once a year. I am hooked.
2,Brahms Educational CD,"We have ordered and used a few of this series cd's only to find that they all have points within the narration where the voice is edited out in the middle of the sentence, making the program incomplete, difficult to follow and nonsensical. The musical aspect is often a nice variety of the composers work but with the incomplete narration, you learn little and leave your audience frustrated."
5,Affordable and Educational,"I bought several of the CDs from this series for homeschooling this year, and they've been an easy non-painful way to learn about composers and to become familiar with their music. They are a bit old fashioned, but not too much so. I have not noticed any spots with edited out narration in any of the CDs, as the other reviewer described."
4,"Great songs, over-busy production.","Another of Dr John's finest. However, a word must be said about John Leckie's production; Dr John's fantastic piano playing is reduced to the far distance on the mix. Pity."
3,One bonus track,"Dr John is an artist with an incredibly original voice. He appears to be immune from the creative burnout that claims so many musicians in the later years of their life. Anutha zone is a masterpiece, but a word caution to those thinking of buying this import the listing incorrectly states the presence of two bonus tacks when in fact a closer look reveals that Look Out is the ONLY BONUS TRACK. Though look out is a great song, many may find its not worth the additional $, therfore I advise purchase of this import only for hardcore dr john fans, who find themselves yearning for more of the soulful gris gris master after listening to the US release."
1,looking for identity,"Dr. John, although a great talent in my estimation, seems to have lost his ability to make great musical and lyrical statements. The ""gris gris"" stuff is old and not as good and original as it once was. Other songs just ramble in search of a place to go but never really hit home. Generally speaking, the songs of the entire album are filler material. Dr. John could use some new blood for musical and lyrical inspiration!"
2,Could be better,"I've had this light for a while. The case is sturdy and the cord is long enough but the clips could be a little stronger. It's easy to knock the light from the stand -- resulting in a broken bulb. Even when not knocked from the stand, the bulbs don't seem to last very long. They're not cheap either! I'm looking around for something better and you probably should too."
2,Music stand light.,"This Manhasset music stand light does not give me the illumination that I had hoped for. Manhasset has elongated the neck of the light so that it's so far away from -- and above -- the music sheet that the light is very faint at best. I suppose they did this in order to accommodate thick music books. It really doesn't provide adequate lighting for me to read my sheet music, though."
2,Shabby,"This did not adhere very well to the trim around our doors.... Even after wiping down around the door making sure not dirt dust or debris, it didn't adhere well at all.... Maybe if you use a stabler along with this product to help stay in place however our doorways are new and didn't want to put staples in it, so I was a bit disappointed ."
5,Good price and easy to install,Installed these baskets for daughter along with slider unit. Good instructions. Easy to install. Slider unit available in different sizes and telescopes to fit. When measuring vertical size of cabinet be sure to allow for minimum/maximum available for slider and width available for baskets. Use a level to ensure unit vertical. Baskets available in various widths and just hook on to slider unit. Simple design and much less expensive than wooden units.
5,I Love this Book!,"I found this book in a Scholastic catalogue when I was teaching third grade. I bought it so that I could expose my students to different poems and poets, and I found it to be truly fabulous! The poems are imaginative, clever, and beautiful. And the illustrations are simply amazing. The poems and artwork delicately capture the harmony and magic of both the natural world, and the world of writing itself. Many of my students, especially my lower readers, bought this book when the following month's catalogue came out. I was surprised just how many kids were inspired and entertained by it. It has become one of my favorite children's poetry books, and I highly recommend it!"
5,Outstanding Place to Start,"Ken Water's text has saved me countless hours in suggesting where to start working up a load for almost any caliber I've pursued. From target to varmint to big game, this volume has quickly become a definitive reference for my handloading. My only criticism is that I wish somehow it could be more quickly updated (perhaps online?) to include new components which are continuously becoming available. Bottom line though, Ken Waters really knows his stuff!"
2,Good Orchestra.... but,"The orchestra was fine... just as Handel would have wanted it. The male soloists were not strong or in the style of this music. The female soloists are far better. The chorus is not balanced at all. Tempos fly all over the place. The music is great, though!"
1,Sparks cartches fire!! Dangerous Dryer!,This is a horrible company. They are producing dryers they know spark and catch on FIRE! Their dryers are a fire hazard & they know it! They make it difficult to return. Charge for shipping and replacements and you pay to ship FIRE HAZARD back! Then the new one does the same thing that is why you see them at marshalls and TJ maxx! Be vary careful! This is a horrible company and they need to protect consumers against Chi!*** Warranty VOID**** if NOT purchased through salon!!!! SO if you buy on here NADA! Really Horrible company!
2,$100 CHI Dryer died after 15 months,"This is my 2nd Farouk CHI PRO GF 1505 and it just died after 15 months. Nothing like being late to work because your blow dryer quits working! My previous one lasted 5 years! Wow, talk about poor quality. I'm ordering a Hot Tools model this time."
4,comfortable,"I love this hair dryer. I purchased it after talking to a few friends that have had CHIs for several years. t gets very hot and dries my hair quickly. My hair is very thick and curly, and I can dry it very easily."
2,great when it works,Price does not mean the product is always good. I sent this unit back to manufactor twice for the same problem and it was repaired for a fee even though it was under warranty. The heating element stopped working both times after about 9 mths.It has now happened again after the second replacement within the year. I got tired of sending the unit back and forth because it cost us the shipping every time. I opened the unit to see if I can at least determine why such an expensive unit would break down 3 times for the same reason. I found that the heating coil is a very thin metal and due to over heating it burns out at the connection near the air output. You would think they would make better connections or a sturdier coil element for such an expensive unit.My recommendation is not to waste your money on Chi-Pro hair dryer.
2,Only lasted 6 months,"I thought this hair dryer was great when I first got it. My hair always seemed less fizzy and more shiny than with other hair dryers I've used. But the motor on it stopped only 6 months after I bought it. And I don't even blow dry my hair everyday. Maybe only a couple times per week. For $100, I would think it would last longer than that."
1,Doesn't last long,"I bought this hair dryer in January of 2010. Now, in December, it only blows cold air. I am not happy. For the price, one would think it should last a little longer. I see a number of other buyers also had this issue, so buyer beware!When it worked, it was fine. Quiet and powerful enough to dry my shoulder length, curly hair straight in about 6 minutes. Only two settings, low and high, so if you like lots of options or a dryer that lasts at least a year, this is not the dryer for you!"
3,Was great while it lasted - Caveat Emptor,I loved this dryer from the day I removed to from the box until the heating element gave out 2 weeks shy of the warranty expiration.I unfortunatley Farouk/CHI won't honor the warranty on any product sold over the web. So I'm without a dryer and out$50.00 more than I would have spent on an average consumer product which would have lasted as long.
1,Our hair is not burned...we are.,"Nice when it works. It stopped blowing hot air in less than 5 months of regular use (twice a day short hair). Chi is VERY picky about what they will ""accept"" as a repair. We got ours new though credit card points and thus we can't get it repaired. The price of this thing should bring with it some reliability...but it doesn't. Do a search on the web under ""chi hair dryer stopped working"" and see what you are in for. They should rent these dryers out at five month intervals instead of selling them. You can do better elsewhere."
1,disappointed,"I really do like this dryer this is the second one I have owned, but my most recent one broke in just over a year and can't be sent back. I had my first one over four years, then the heating part of it went out. My second one had the heating unit go out also but sparks flew out of it toward my hair while I was drying it, it frightened me. I am not sure I can justify spending the money to buy another one even though I really like it when it works."
1,Junk,Bought this for my girlfriend. Didn't even last 6 months. Returned it about 4 months ago. Since then Farouk has given me the run around. Farouk doesn't stand behind their products. I will never buy another Farouk product. Quite possibly the worst hair dryer made. Purchase at your own risk. If I could I would give this product zero stars.
3,Expensive but is it that different? I don't think so?,"I ordered this thinking that possibly it had a bigger motor (like the ones in the Salons that I go to). With the larger motors my hair dries quicker. I like this dryer but the only real difference I can actually tell is that it is quiter than most hair dryers I have used. Hopefully, this dryer will last a long while so that financially I'll feel better about the purchase . . . time will tell."
1,"Good while it lasted, which wasn't very long","I wanted to invest in a quality hair dryer that would last a long time and prevent frizz and flyaways. The dryer worked as expected at first - quick drying time and quiet, smoother hair after drying - but it seemed only slightly better than a regular dyer, with a MUCH higher price tag. Then after a year of only using it 3 to 4 times a week, the hairdryer completely died. As I'm sure you can see from many of the recent reviews, this is not uncommon - for such an expensive hairdryer, this should not be the case. I certainly do not think it was worth the cost, especially considering its short life span. I've used the Revlon Tourmaline hair dryer in the year since, which is a much more reasonable $19.99, and it's been just as good as the CHI."
1,defective won't last over 6 months,"Bought this hair dryer from Amazon seller ""Payless Beauty"" for my daughter for Christmas last year. The button on the dryer that switches it to cool broke after one month. They sent a new identical dryer to replace it..and six months later, the dryer broke again..same problem! I have had no response to repeated emails to try to get it replaced. My advice; DO NOT BUY this dryer...PIECE OF JUNK!(could this be a cheap Chinese knockoff they are palming off as a genuine CHI product? and DON'T BUY FROM PAYLESS BEAUTY unless you like being ignored.Farouk CHI Pro GF 1505 1300 Watt Ceramic Anion Infared Low EMF Professional Hair Dryer"
2,Expensive doesn't mean good quality,"I bought this hairdryer for my wife and it stopped working after 18 months. We bought a more expensive one like this because we thought it would last. Don't bother buying expensive, go for the $35 dryers. They last just as long."
2,Farouk Chi Pro GF 1505 Overrated,"Bought this in Jan. 2009 and was quite pleased until this morning when there was no more heat coming out. A blow dryer that only lasts 1 1/4 years, at this price, is not a great investment. It was never used more than a few minutes every few days. Really feel this was not worthwhile for such a short time. It seems others have had this issue too. Would not recommend this dryer."
2,Is 6 mo good enough for a hair dryer?,"I loved this dryer. While it lasted.I agree with everyone's comments about the performance of the dryer- it dries quickly and leaves your hair shiny and very easy to style. Mine lasted about 6 months before the heating element stopped working. Then you are left with a strong dryer that only blows cold air. Useless. So, if you use it every day for 6 months- that would be approx 180 uses, it cost me $90 at the time, so that would be 50 cents per use. Worth it for a great blow out? Up to you..."
2,"works well, but not for long","I loved this hair dryer for about a year, and then it after that it would only blow cold air. This happened with two different Chi dryers, so I don't think I got a bad one. At first, it really cut my drying time and my hair looked very nice. But I have very thick (although short - not even chin length) hair, which I guess this hair dryer cannot handle. For me, it wasn't worth the price for only a year of use."
1,no heat after 6 months,"This was a great dryer until it stopped making hot air. To get warranty, it would have been a paid phone call to set up RMA and a $15 fee, plus shipping... went back to my old $15 dryer."
2,Not a good buy for the money,"This hairdryer was great for about 11 months. I loved it and raved about it to everyone I know. However, after 11 months the power went to about half. And, 2 months later sparks/smoke came out and it completely died. RIP Chi Pro. I thought it would last longer for the money. I am very sadded by the loss. So, I am trying out a new brand, twinturbo. (recommended to be by my stylist)"
2,BROKEN AFTER 3 MONTHS!,"We splurged on an expensive hair dryer for my daughter only to have it stop working after 3 months! We were then told by Amazon to contact Farouk, who said we would have to pay $15 and shipping to have the warranty honored. Amazon told us to ship it back to Amazon and they paid the shipping and did replace it. Thank you Amazon, but what a hassle. We only hope it lasts longer than 3 months. We like their hair straightener (which has lasted well)but will not buy another Farouk product because of this experience!"
2,Didn't last long,"Nice, quiet hair dryer that we liked while it lasted...but...I bought this hair dryer on 5/6/09 and the heating element in it is already broken...just blows cold air now. That's pretty disappointing for the amount of money spent on this hair dryer and with such light use (used once or twice a day), so I recommend against buying it."
4,Not bad,"Before I bought it, I read lost of reviews on Amazon and was a little bit upset. ;) Well I haven't used it so far cause I am a short hair guy. :-) But wife said she was really happy with it, low noise, well feeling. If she is happy, I am happy."
2,WARNING!!:Did not last,"I purchased this about 2.5 months ago and gave it to my son, a hairstylist. It worked beautifully until a week ago. All of a sudden, he gets nothing but cold air. Too much money to invest to get this result-so quickly! I wished it had a better warranty. I think I would have come out better purchasing directly from the company, instead of Amazon. I just wonder if this was a 2nd or refurbished product."
2,Overpriced - Works OK,"I gave this two stars because it doesn't work any better than a 19.99 dryer from your local drug store. I wasn't worth the effort to return it, but I would NEVER purchase another one NOR would I ever recommend spending so much money, it is a waste."
3,Farouk CHI Pro 1505 Hair Dryer,"The Farouk CHI is too big, too heavy, and comes in black only. I had a nice little dryer, Perfection Compact 1600 Model#H53C-0298 that was compact (with folding handle), light weight, and white. It lasted for a long time.The one good thing about the Farouk CHI is that it is very quiet. I just hope it will also last a long time."
5,"Great Dryer, Great Hair","I bought this hairdryer after my trusty BabyBliss ceramic started sparking and smoking. I loved my old dryer, but it was super loud and pretty heavy.When I first turned the new dryer on I was surprised at how quiet it was and had some reservations about how well it would dry my hair since it wasn't blowing very hard or hot. I was shocked at how fast my hair dried. With the BabyBliss my hair took a solid 30 minutes, and that's if I was rushing. The Chi dried my hair in twice as fast. I was so used to the timing of my old dryer that my hair was dry before I had a chance to style it. The first round my hair did have a lot of static and was a little flat. But I found that I had to adjust to the new dryer- I have to start to style it much earlier, about 10 minutes in, to get good body and curl the ends. Now that I've become accustomed to the Chi's speedy work, my hair looks great and I've got an extra 10 minutes in the morning."
1,Failed after 6 months and mfg. warranty is void if purchased from Amazon.,Purchased this hair dryer six months ago and the heating element failed. Pretty short lifespan for a dryer. Called mfg. and was told warranty is VOID if purchased online (I confirmed this on Chi's website) and they also stated Amazon is not an authorized retailer. Amazon made good on the warranty after a few phone calls and sent a replacement unit.This warranty exclusion applies to all Farouk Systems products according to the mfg. I'm sure Amazon will honor the existing warranties but be prepared for a little extra work if your unit fails.
1,Died after six weeks!!,"I purchased this product late Nov., hoping I bought something that would last a very long time considering the high price of this dryer. The hair dryer worked great at first; then just today it started to die out on me....I noticed the plug was extremely warm. I tried it a few hours later and it was completely dead. The warranty is not valid for purchases made over the internet, so I guess I'm out $80!!"
3,CHI QUALITY,"I'm a professional hair stylist and use a CHI dryer, flat iron, and curl iron in the salon every day. My fellow stylist and myself have found that the QUALITY of the CHI products is not at all what we have come to expect form professional tools. There are MORE REALIABLE choices out there! Save your receipt and original packaging, if yours brakes you'll need it to get warranty service."
4,Silent,"It dries hair well but not faster as the manufacturer claims it does. This drier is very quiet so noise wise it's pleasant to use. Amazon does not honor the manufacturer's warranty which is void if the drier is purchased at any place that is not a salon. So far so good, only l0 days using it. Consumer Reports gives it a good rating. However, they do not justify the suggested retail price of 135.00 for what it does. I got it for 40.00 through Amazon.com because I took advantage of the credit card offer: 30.00 off my first purchase. I only did it because it ended up being a good deal for me. Bottom line: if one wants healthy looking hair a hair dryer is not going to do it. The best thing to do is avoid using it as much as possible. It just doesn't make any sense to use a hair drier and expect its outcome to be healthy looking hair. To me that is just an oxymoron. Marketing can say anything to sell stuff."
3,Okay,I thought this hair dryer would have dried my hair faster but it didn't. It actually takes longer then my other hair dryer I had.
1,Doesn't live up to the hype,"Have been using my dryer for about a week. It definitely is quieter than my previous dryer, but it does NOT dry my hair any faster than other dryers. Also the dryer is heavier than any dryer I have ever used. Not worth the price tag in my opinion. I also hope it doesn't die like many others have reported, not at the price you are charging."
5,Quick + Quite = GREAT!,"I have thick curly hair. This dryer works very well on it. it's quick and quite and styles my hair either controlled curl or straight very easily. No frizz. No ""pouf""."
5,Much better than a standard blow dryer,"This blow dryer was well worth the extra money, which was only about $50 more than a standard dryer. It puts out good heat and does everything the product claims. The best feature, in my opinion, is how quiet this dryer is. My wife uses a dryer every morning and the hearing loss this saves her is well worth the extra money. I expect it to last longer as well, but that remains to be seen. I have seen lower cost dryers that ""burn up"" after a few years so if this lasts longer, it may actually average out to lower cost. I noticed the power is only 1300 watts, which may help to keep it quiet, but it dries hair just as quickly, if not quicker. I tried several other dryers, including the popular Babyliss, but I found this Chi dryer to be the quietest by far."
5,Worth the Investment!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was skeptical about spending this much money on a blow dryer, BUT it is worth every dime. I have very thick, very curly, just below the chin length hair. I literally dried my mop in ONLY 9 minutes! That's unheard of for my hair. I'm usually drying for at least 30 minutes. I use the dryer with the CHI 1 inch flat-iron and my hair looks incredible. Don't hestiate to buy it!"
3,Burnt out on Chi,"I bought 2 Chi hair dryers at the same time, one for home and one for work.13 months after I got them, the first one lost the heat. A week later, the other one started making a funny noise, and then burnt out. I'm going back to Solano."
1,"Plastic case Cracking, COUNTERFEIT?","Ummm, well I have this great very expensive hair dryer. The Plastic is cracking apart after 60 days use. blades are vibrating also.I called Farouk the Manufacturer, they Said Amazon.com is NOT an authorized dealer so no warranty can be used. They said it is mostly likely a counterfeit.NOT COOL AMAZON!!!!"
1,Great while it lasted,"I bought this dryer in Dec 2009 and it stopped working in Feb 2011. For the money that is not long enough in my book as it was not an inexpensive one. It worked great while it did work. It heats up the way a professional blow dryer does and concentrates the air flow so it doesn't blow the rest of your hair around while trying to smooth sections. But again, I just can't see paying this kind of money for something that lasts just over a year. Would not recommend."
3,Great until it broke 18 months later,"Loved this hairdryer. Then, it stopped producing hot air. Now its just a cold hair dryer. Only 18 months of use..."
1,Farouk Chi Pro GF Ceramic Low EMF Dryer,"Just had to have this dryer replaced after only 8 months of casual, personal use only every second day. It still worked but would not provide heat, only cool air. For this $$ a dryer should last a couple years. Farouk will not provide warranty for any Amazon purchases as they could be selling refurbished items apparently, so if you purchase and it stops working properly, Amazon makes good on returns if you return the broken one to them within 30 days."
2,Great Hair Dryer But DOES NOT LAST,"I absolutely loved this hair dryer- it dried my long, thick, hair quickly and made it smooth and shiny. When it died the first time (after about 6 months) I was able to replace it and continued to be happy with the purchase. Long story short - and THREE hair dryers later, I am unable to return the newest drier because the warranty is only 1 year and yet again it has died and only blows cold air. Considering the cost- this is a toss up."
2,"Good product, but only lasted a year.","This was my second Chi dryer to stop working in under a year's time, which is really disapointing considering how much they cost. This dryer worked really well until recently, when it started blowing occasional bursts of cold air. The other day it started shooting sparks (!) and then stopped blowing hot air completely. My mother-in-law bought the same hair dryer 6 months ago, and hers did the same exact thing. Farouk only offers a year warranty, so I suppose I'm out of luck. My next hair dryer will be a T3 dryer, which offers a 4 year warranty."
4,Not for fine hair,"I really like this dryer,..it's quiet, fit's in my hand comfortably, w/good switch locations. It's a great quality dryer,.HOWEVER, if you have baby fine hair, forget it! I read somewhere that ionic dryers are not good for fine hair because it makes the hair more limp. So true. I wish I would have remembered that. Everyone wants shiny, sleek hair, & that's ok if yours isn't stick straight and baby fine. It seems 99.9% of dryers now are ionic. So I am on here today to buy a normal, non-ionic dryer. Like the one I had. So if you have a lot of hair,.this is a sensational dryer."
2,Worked great for 15 months!,"I was very happy with this purchase. I got it on a gold box deal and paid only $79.99. Even that, I considered expensive, but I thought I'd splurge and see what all the CHI fuss was about. It worked quickly, was light and my hair looked great. Unfortuntely, when I got out of the shower this morning and plugged it in, it was dead. I bought it in late April 2007 and this is mid July 2008, so I got 15 months of daily use out of it, but I will have to think long and hard about buying another hair dryer with only a 1 year warranty. I am very disappointed. I rationalized the cost by thinking I would use it for 5+ years."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM !!!!!!,Do not purchase this item if you plan on using it beyond 30 days as the manufacturer does not cover the unit if it is purchased online. I bought this for my wife and it stopped working. The warranty inside the box states that it is covered for one year but that contradicts what is stated in the product description on Amazon.com. I think that this form of coverage is problematic and unfair. If the manufacturer's warranty is not honored if sold through Amazon then Amazon should not sell it. The representative from Farouk stated that they will only warranty the unit if purchased by a professional salon. Good luck if you choose to purchase anyway.
2,only lasted 1 year. Do not buy this product,"The CHI hair dryer was great for exactly one year. I bought it from Amazon and was super excited. Now when I turn it on it blows cool air, not hot air as it did before. I have bought less expensive hair dryers that still work after 6 years. I am very dissapointed!!! There is noone who can repair it and the price you pay for the product is not worth it."
2,Went Cold After 376 Days,"Loved, loved, loved this hair dryer but it just went cold after 376 days. Not acceptable for such an expensive hair dryer."
1,"The Chi Pro 1505 is the WORST, VERY WORST","This is the second Chi Pro gf1505 I have purchased in 18 months. I liked the way it dried my hair and thought that maybe the failure of my first one after 8 months was a fluke. NO, it is a horrible product that does not last. The new one also failed and now just blows cold air just like the first. I work from home and do not even use this dryer every day. It got used about 3 times a week. I would not recommend anyone spend the money on this product. If you research it online you will see that not only does the heating element fail very frequently it is also a fire hazard and the plug will become very hot for no reason. Please beware and warn all you know.This company does not back up their product at all. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS."
1,"nothing special, especially from CHI","I love my CHI straightener, however this hair dryer was a total miss. It is quiet which is nice, but it didn't provide any less frizz, especially in the Florida humidity. My biggest complaint with this product is that the on/off button is exactly where you hold the dryer so during the drying process, you are constantly turning it off...HUGE ISSUE! This was really not what i was expecting and definitely not what I wanted :("
2,Not as good as my RUSK hairdryer,"I've been using this CHI hair dryer for about a month now and really don't like it. It does not put out as much hot air, or dry my hair as fast as my Rusk hairdryer. Sure it makes your hair look better/pretty, but it takes twice as long as what I'm used to."
5,great hairdryer,This Farouk CHI hair dryer is great and I encourage anyone who needs a high end product to purchase this one
3,expensive but much better than the cheapies,"i think its a great hair dryer: its fast, pretty quiet, and its powerful. It may be my imagination (or my justification for spending so much $$ on a hair dryer) but my hair feels softer and smoother. I dont really notice much of a change in the speed it takes, compared to my old revlon dryer...but it definitely is quieter -- I can have a conversation while I dry my hair."
5,arrived quick for Christmas,"My daughter was very happy with this gift, and I was happy that it arrived before Christmas."
2,No Heat,I've purchased 3 of these hair dryers over the past 3 years and all 3 no longer gave off heat. Each of them lasted over 6 months but from there it was downhill.
1,Don't buy it - both mine broke down in 2+ years!,"I bought 2 in Feb 2009, and both broke down recently. So they are great when they work, but they don't last very long."
1,Don't Purchase this Hair Dryer - only last 6 months,"Don't purchase this hair dryer, they only last 6 months or so. After the initial purchase, unit did not heat or work. Returned to mfr. under warranty but costs $15 for shipping and handling. They only provide 90 day warranty on the returned unit. The returned/repaired unit (actually was replaced with a new one) only lasted 6 months and now not working again. Customer service at Farouk Systems - (Chi Hair Dryers) only stated that this unit had a 90 day warranty. Theydid not seem to care that the units stop working or willing to offer any type of replacement or discount for another unit. The Quality of the units vs. the high cost of the unit does not seem to equate to the mfr's review or our expectations. Thought it would last longer than 6 months for an expensive hair dryer like this. Take caution before purchasing these units --- may not be worth the cost."
2,Do not buy this hair dryer!,"Purchased the Farouk Chi GF1505 and on the 3rd day it stopped making heat! After searching the reviews...I see that I am not alone! Numerous complaints on the ""heating element"" burning out within 6 months to a years time. Go with the BabylissPro Nano Titanium Portofino instead."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this dryer because I owned a Chi previously which I loved. That one lasted me for over five years - this one lasted for less than 6 months. For the money I paid, I would expect better quality. The dryer no longer gets even close to warm, which makes it impossible to dry hair."
5,Fantastic hairdryer,"I purchased this hairdryer after reading all of the reviews. I was hesitant only because of the cost but I am really glad I spent the money. What used to take me 20 minutes now takes me 5-7 minutes. The hair dryer I used to have made my hair dry and full of static. This hair dryer somehow does not dry out my hair and the static is gone. It is much quieter, too. It's fairly light and easy to handle and it has a ""cool"" button. I am very glad I made this purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a hairdryer."
2,Great while it lasted.,"I had this dryer for just over a year and a half and used it almost daily. The heating element just went out the other morning.I'm very disappointed because it was the best dryer I've ever owned. It wasn't too loud, kept my hair from getting frizzy and used less electricity than other dryers. However, I've had cheapo dryers from the drug store last longer. I didn't expect and expensive dryer like this to break so quickly."
3,New or Used?,I was a little surprised with this purchase. I have purchased a number of things from amazon and never had issue. This particular item was sold as new but when I received you could tell that someone else had perviously returned. The item was in good condition and works fine but new should be new or the price should be adjusted. I don' t really blame amazon but the distributor they used.
1,Very Disappointing,I've had this dryer for only six months and it's already broken. I use it once a day and about a month ago it started intermittently blowing cold air. Today sparks flew and it went completely cold. Way too expensive for such a short life. Was great while it lasted though :-/
1,Too expensive to last only 12 months,"I really liked this product when I purchased. Lightweight, dries your hair quickly, quiet etc. But after 12 months of normal use, it's a broken hair dryer. It only blows cold air. Really disappointed. I have a few ""cheap"" hair dryers that I've had for years and I was going to give away since I had this one. Luckily I've kept them or I would be w/out a hair dryer now. I noticed that this dryer does get really hot - probably why it dries your hair so quickly but wondering if this burns it out faster than other ones. After reading other reviews, seems like it is a common problem with these dryers and no warranty coverage when you buy through Amazon (other than 30 day warranty)."
1,Didn't even last 2 years!! Heat went out!,"I bought this product in Feb. 2009 and I used it to blow dry my hair every day like normal. I loved this blow dryer until it went out on me! All of the sudden one day in Dec. 2010 it just stopped putting out heat and now it just blows cold air! For how much this blow dryer cost, I would expect it to last longer...It didn't even last 2 years!"
2,Disappointed !,"I bought this hair dryer from Amazon about 18 months ago and finally it decided only to blow cold air as other reviews stated. For such an expensive hair dryer, I really expect it will work at least a few more years. Long story short, after hearing my complain for a few days, my husband decided to try to fix it. He opened it up and found one side of the heating element is disconnected. He reconnected it and now the dryer is blowing hot air again. I am posting a few images to show the process and hope can help others with same problem."
1,Broke after 6 months,I read the reviews and i took the chance. What more can i say? Bought the Dryer July 20th and it stopped working today. The heat just stopped. It now only blows cold air. I've always bought my hairdryers at wal-mart. Just basic $20-$30 dryers and they lasted for years. Unfortunately this one just barely made 6 months. I wouldn't mind but it was the most expensive one i ever bought and no warranty cause i bought on Amazon. I will also add that i never really noticed too much of a difference from the $20-$30 ones i've bought.
1,No hot air after 5 months! Heating element fails.,After using this dryer for 5 months I noticed a hot spot or bright red/orange spot on the heating element. I asssumed it was normal. After that happened for about a week the hair dryer's heating element failed. Called Farouk and they told me that since it was purchased from Amazon the warranty is VOID and they also stated Amazon is not an authorized retailer.
3,Low Wattage for the $$$,"Overall, I am pleased with this hair dryer, but it took a little getting used to. I previously had a small, inexpensive, Revlon hair dryer that put out 1875 watts compared to this model, which is larger but is only 1300 watts. It is quite heavy compared to my old dryer because of the ceramic plates. It actually takes longer to dry my hair than my old dryer. I do feel better about using this model because of its low emf output, but if you are going to spend this kind of money on a dryer, I would invest in a model that has higher wattage."
3,Lasted 1.5 Years,"After I graduated college, I wanted a ""grown-up"" hair dryer that was nice. I put this blow dryer on my Christmas list and got it a year and a half ago. Sadly, the heating element went out on it this morning. As many other reviewers have said, I'd expect this dryer to work for much longer for the cost. I will say that the dryer was pretty quiet and did a great job drying my fine, straight hair. However, my cheap hair dryer that I got back in high school STILL works. The quality of this hair dryer apparently needs to be improved."
2,Should last longer for the price...,"Initially I really liked this hair dryer, it did dry my hair and leave it less frizzy than previous dryers. It is a bit heavy, but you get used to it. I purchased this item 2 years ago and it just broke today. I typically use the dryer about 3 times a week, so it wasn't even used every day. I was in the middle of drying my hair this morning when sparks started shooting out of the dryer into my hair, and the heating element went out. I only had a few singed hairs, thank goodness, it could have been a lot worse. I would love to have left a good review, however if I'm spending $120 on a hair dryer it needs to last longer than 2 years. My last hair dryer was a Conair and it only cost $30 and lasted me over 6 years. Buyer beware..."
2,Not a good selection,The choices of stories in this book are not very good. Some of them are repeats of other anthologies. Others are do not present very original ideas. I couldn't really get into any stories in this book. It's average at best.
4,A scientific/engineering view of natural disasters.,"An interesting perspective of natural disaters. Beginning with basic science and engineering principles relating to architectural and construction considerations, types of natural forces, historic case studies of natural disasters. Really fascinating read, recommended."
2,Eve Rides Again!,"This is another autobiography from the woman who was the subject of *Three Faces of Eve* and later wrote *Final Face of Eve* as ""Evelyn Lancaster"". She lived for many years with multiple personalities and much of the book is about this. I don't take repressed memories or ""cult abuse"" seriously, but her weird story is a lifelong personal favorite of mine. My father met Sizemore during a personal appearance she made in the 1970s; she lived in my hometown of Greenwood SC at that time. (I was a small child and was not invited). Since that time she has gotten involved with people claiming to be survivors of cult abuse and even written part of a book on this topic. Definitely recommended for Eve fans or anyone loving insane tales of...insanity. (Chris, more power to ya! When's your next book coming out?)"
4,Great,Great way to communicate with others. the nly downfall is that it is scraggley with the pager and the walkie talkie. Other than that it is great.David
1,gay,i have a lot of brothers and they like really anything but this watch this watch has so like wow lets stop and look but i dont think this is a cool watch
4,Top Drawer,"If I were to teach a class in C, I'd use this book along with a good C reference (updated from K&R;). This book is not a tutorial but in many ways it reads like one. The most astounding part of it is that one can sit in one's chair, read it, and not feel as if one has to go to the computer and run the compiler in order to ""get it"".A person getting into C coding should buy this one in the first group of books. Doubly amazing is to find a technical book this good for this little money."
5,Excellent Intro to GCC,"Fantastic book for learning the basics of the GCC compiler. The GNU toolchain development process was always a mystery to me, as I've almost always used pre-baked IDEs. Compiler options were always guesses and I'd have a tough time determining what was really happening when reading messages due to (successful or not) compilation. After reading through this book, I have a much better idea of what's going on behind the scenes and I'm now comfortable enough with GCC to start from scratch and integrate it into my own IDE, if necessary. Even though the book is a bit old, it's still quite relevant, especially for those just getting started."
4,Excellent introduction!!,"I just spent the last few hours reading through this. I spend most of my time in dynamic languages, Python mostly, but was wanting to get involved in some C-programming. This intro to GCC really helped clarify the compilation process and especially clarified the ""black magic"" (or so I thought) regarding library and header file dependencies.It is a little old and I did run into a problem when doing the example on dynamically linked libraries. The example uses sqrt(), but in modern gcc, that is a builtin function so running the example does not throw an error as expected. Use the -fno-builtin option to gcc to see the error as shown in the example.This really was the perfect balance of basic examples, and concise and clear explanations. The only reason I gave it a 4 star review is because of being a bit dated and having the builtin function problem I just described."
5,nice intro to gcc,"The book provides a detailed introduction to gcc compiler. After reading this book, compiling a source code and writing script files should not be a problem. Nice intro to using optimizer and other options of gcc"
5,a really delightul and helpful small book,"I've been reading and using this little book for the past few weeks. I'm an experienced C programmer but I wanted to switch to GCC having abandoned both Borland (my version was getting quite old) & Microsoft (messy with a crippled deployment system) compilers on Win XP.This small book, and that is one of its great charms, is perfect. It REALLY helped me make the transition and I have been very sucessfully building code on Ubuntu Linux and Win XP (MinGW) with GCC. Once up and running the more subtle features can be found on the web at the GNU website (an example for me was how to switch off certain warnings such as -Wno-unused).Though GCC is intrinsically tied to Linux the information in the book is readily translatable to the MinGW-Win XP environment."
4,Full of good stuff to know,"I've found personally that junior or hobbyist programmers/developers rely on the IDE to do much of the compilation work without really understanding what the compiler does or what it can do. Which is good because they can focus on programming, not mucking around with the tools to make the programs.However when something goes wrong with the compilation process, or things need to be tweaked, a lot of these programmers would be hard pressed to fix or change the system. They also have a limited knowledge of all the useful features available to them. Reading this book would be a definite help.I would recommend this to developers who wants to know more about the tools they use without going overly in-depth. It covers the compiler, and it's interaction with other tools like the linker, archiver, debugger and the preprocessor. It gives a basic look at optimization and some trouble shooting techniques as well."
3,not as tasty as original orange Emergen-C,"Not as tasty as the original Orange Emergen-C. More like an alkaseltzer taste, without the grainy, medicine texture, which is ok with me, I suppose."
2,can not directly feel the energy,"I just can not directly feel the energy after drinking it. I do not know how to guage its long-term benefit, I do not really want to.However, if one is looking for an immediate feeling of ""surge of energy"", there are much more suitable products out there."
1,Safeworld Spam and Pop-Up Blocker,Pop-ups still occuring abeit at a reduced rate. It refuses to allow any gameplay at all. E-mail service in now sporadic at best. Custumer service is zilch after many e-mails. My advice to try any other product other than Safeworld.
1,Bugs disguised as software,"It did stop ad pop-ups. It also made ten times as many with the ""debug"", ""run time errors"" and other eror messages that it caused. The ""form filler"" pop up is annoying and the start up pop-up interferes with my wi-fi and my gprs start-up. I ran it for a day and nuked it off my system. Avoid this piece of junk at all costs."
5,A cautionary tale,"This book is a page turner. It really made me think about the ramifications of testing and labeling kids. In this case, the school tested this kid endlessly, couldn't find anything wrong, but insisted on labeling him learning disabled, in spite of substantial documentation of his intellectual growth and literacy. It's great for teachers to read, because it can really make you think about our testing practices and their effects on kids. It would also be good reading for a parent of a tested and labeled kid."
1,Streaky & Blotchy,"These wipes left streaks and blotches all over my dashboard. I wiped my dash down and let the product sit for a minute, then wiped the excess off with a clean cloth. What was left behind looked like the inside of a McDonald's bag--tons of greasy splotches. I tried buffing with little luck.Luckily, the streaks weren't permanent. To fix the streaks and blotches, get a bucket of warm water and add a drop of dishwashing soap. Then, using a clean microfiber cloth, scrub down the affected areas. Dry and repeat if necessary.Do yourself, your car, and your wallet a favor; don't buy this product."
4,"Decent Wipes, Leave Shine on Car Interior","I like these wipes for shining up the interior of my car. I didn't experience the blotching that the other review expressed. I use the ""cleaning wipes""Armor All Cleaning Wipes 25-Count Plastic Canister (Pack of 6)to clear off all of the dust and dirt first, before I use these ""Protectant Wipes"" and that seems to work well, leaving the car looking clean for a decent amount of time.My only complaint about these is that they usually dry up before I get through the whole bottle of wipes. The cap isn't the tightest closing lid I've ever seen (and I'm sure the Florida heat doesn't help, though I usually store them indoors).Overall, however, I do recommend these as you can get several cleanings out of them, and they are much cheaper than paying someone to detail your car for you. I also use the glass cleaning wipes for the windows and windshield:Armor All Glass Cleaner Wipes 25-Count Plastic Canister (Pack of 6)"
1,Horrible streaks,"Like others have mentioned, I should have read the reviews first! I thought this would be a simple purchase of a convenient product to help keep my new car clean. I used a wipe as directed, and it left streaks all over the dashboard. The streaky residue was then difficult to remove. Unfortunately, these are going straight to the trash. (I'll recycle the plastic canister!)"
1,Should've come here and read the reviews before buying.,"I bought these at a brick and mortar, and they're terrible. As the other reviewers have mentioned, they leave streaks and blotches everywhere. Gross."
3,"not a whole lot louder than stock, but ok","Bought this for a 2004 F150 Lightning. Have had Flowmaster products before and loved sound from all of them. This was kind of a let down on my truck. Its a little more throatier at 3/4 to wide open throttle compared to stock, but at idle or easy acceleration, its not much more than stock. I was looking for a bit more, but not obnoxious. This was too tame for me, but a good quality product like all flowmaster."
1,a note on longevity,"prior versions were impregnated with iodine and lasted me about 4 years of hiking about two weeks a year - that's a lot!not this. lasted one year, clogged on a mountainside.at nearly the same price as aSteriPEN Traveler Handheld UV Water Purifier(which is on sale for forty bucks today at amazon), the writing is on the wall for Katadyn. UV + backup chlorine tablets = lightweight, dependable, quick and cheap!"
2,Not my PUR filter replacement,Be careful when you order this for an older PUR water pump filter. It does not fit the one I have.
5,Works great!,"Used this on a four-day Appalachian Trail hike, and it worked great. I was with a scout group, and there were two other water filtration products in the group. The Katadyn worked much better than the other two, and we ended up using it to filter water for most of the group. Would wholeheartedly recommend."
4,If the shoe fits...,"I ordered this to replace a used up filter in a ""Pur Hiker"" pump. The pump design is the same as the Katadyn Hiker but the issue of brand name interchangeability was a concern. Well, if anyone else was wondering about whether or not this filter will work in your old Pur brand filter/pump - it does. Also the filter element protector screen... thing... seems like an improvement over the OG Pur filters which were pretty good already (many, many gallons of all sorts of Alaskan water filtered with this system; no beaver trots to speak of and we've got lots of big ol gnarly beavers up here).I only give it a 4 star rating because, well heck, I don't want to just give the fifth one away ...gotta keep 'em trying you know."
3,Works great-for a while,"I bought this to replace the filter in our Katadyn Base Camp filter. This a a great filter, but doesn't last for the 500 gallons it is advertized. Perhaps 50 gallons? Katadyn needs to change the label on this so people know what they are getting."
2,"Overpriced, doesn't last long at all...","This filter will maybe last you for 75 gallons if you are lucky, and that's on the higher end. Knowing this, the price should be half of what it is. If you pay $60-70 to initially buy the filter, you shouldn't have to pay $32 dollars (half the price of the filter) just for a new cartridge that works for less than half its advertised lifespan.I was using it in seemingly clear brook and stream water, not in mud, so I expect it to last a little longer.I have found that putting a coffee filter over the inlet tube on the filter will strain out some of the finer particulate, thereby giving you a little more life out of the cartridge. Although, I think that after spending $60 on a portable water filter you should not have to resort to this simply to get more life out of it."
3,"Works well, just not that long","The hiker pro replacement catridges work since I've used them for years and no one has gotten sick. They do not last nearly as long as advertised though. I typically get around 35-45 gallons out of one filter, which is not nearly the 200 gallons stated. I've learned a few tricks extend the life of the catridge over the years. I canoe a lot, and I always fill up a collapsable camp bucket out in the deeper, clear water. Then I pour the water through a coffee filter and into my base camp reservoir. If you are using the portable hiker pro, you can bring a couple of 2-liter bottles. Fill one bottle and pour it through a coffee filter into the other one. Then pump out of the coffee filtered bottle. Coffee filters gave me another 10-15 gallons of life out of the filter, and their cheap!"
1,The worst mouse of all time!,"Right out of the package the mouse seemed suspiciously cheap; from it's low grade plastic body to buttons that barely click. Even the manual is flawed with numerous spelling mistakes suggesting it was written by someone who barely speaks English. During use, the cursor skips across the screen with little control and when attempting to select an icon nothing happens. Shame on you Inland."
4,Experiential Design,"With the exception of numerous spelling mistakes present in this book, I must say that Tom Peters has done a great job in instilling the importance of design. Now, why design is so important? Gone are the days of product functionality or brand loyalty. Consumerism has evolved over the years, and many consumers are increasingly attached to key product attributes such as brand culture, design, experience, and image. I believe that his focus is how to create receptive yet experiential design in the area of products and services, and most importantly in marketing and selling them.To summarise it, Tom Peter's Design Essentials has brought out lots of reiterative design concepts and ideas which are beneficial in one's business to deliver better and more receptive products and services - Re-design, Re-invent, and Re-market Them!"
2,Great book - but printing quality very poor.,"Well written book and a interesting reading. What a shame the printing quality was so poor, only half of each page had been printed on and the letters so small that they are hard to read....!!!Make sure you dont get that finish."
3,Plant Anchors,These work as expected and hold the plants down in the tank. My only concern was for the health of the fish but it doesnt' seem to effect them at all.
1,Not heavy enough,need to wrap 3 or 4 around the base of a plastic plant to keep it in the gravel. waste of money.
1,what a rip off!,700 words for 6 bucks? I had good faith in the decency of people and am now completely disillusioned! would've been better to give my money to a thief!
3,helpful advice when you are at your wits end,"I had trouble like lots of people getting my kid to bed. And this is like a support book for parents, with recommendations on choices you can make to help sleep patterns improve. It helps you develop a plan, adjust your plan, etc. to improve your child's sleep habits. It is very slow going, and the book did help. However, we never got a full night sleep with my son until I weaned him."
4,A fun read,"Although it's taken me three separate attempts to sit down and read this book, I've finally finished it. It's a fun read, and once you get past the first couple of chapters, really start to feel for the characters. Living in Brisbane, I could really visualise the locations referred to in the book, which made it even better."
2,Not what I expected,"This was one of the first things I ordered through Amazon, and I guess being new I was naive. I was expecting the Disney version and got the Hans Christian Anderson version and there is a world of difference. I felt it was my fault and did not send it back. It came in a timely manner and was in perfect condition."
1,This is not the original story,"If you purchase this DVD expecting to get the original version of the story (which has a sad ending, as opposed to the Disney version), you will be seriously disppointed, as was I. This movie is only 41 minutes long and does not have the original ending by Hans Christian Anderson. It is a cute enough cartoon, but basically a shortened Disney version, and not at all what I had expected."
1,I didn't recieve the original,"I bought this because the reviews visible at the time said that this was the original animated version - the one with the sad ending.The first thing I did when I got the movie was skip to the end to see if it was the right version. It's not. The mermaid and the prince get married, and the king makes a little speech about ending evil pollution.It's probably a good movie, but I'm so disappointed that it's not the one I was hoping and searching for that I can't bring myself to watch it."
2,"Long title, short book","For such a long title it's a very short book. Even if there were only two pages per item in the title the book would be longer when it is now. I already own a book about the Celtic Gods and Goddesses and it has for more pages then this volume does. I hate to black list any book, but I would have been better off not buying this one and saving my money towards something with a little more meat on it."
3,A Little Precaution goes far,"Nice to have the spare parts along. I think it could use a couple of Quick Fill Hydration Adaptors added in. When I bought my Katadyn Filte it came with 1 and a half connectors. ;O}..silly huh? Other than that, cool stuff..."
1,Don'yt buy this one!,"It's easy to review, it broke the first time I used it and Moroso states they WON'T give a refund if it has been used. DON'T BUY IT."
3,Very pretty,We took our old lights out and the base was larger so the hole is way bigger than these lights. We have to figure out something to hide the hole before we can hook them up. The lights are beautiful looking but we won't know how they work until we fix the hole.
2,worth a buck or two,"Well this certainly isnt DC's best work but a couple of songs are ok like ""Now You're Gone"" , ""The Deeper the Love"", "" Judgement Day"" and ""Sailing Ships"" the rest is really bad. As far as the Steve Vai being right for Whitesnake? Well he's a bit shreddy for my taste but I wouldnt fault the guy for earning a paycheck from David Coverdale, as he did a god a job and wasnt responsible for the silly lyrics which really ruin the cd as far as I am concerned."
2,major disappointment,"Probably the worst Whitesnake album. Not only do you have stupid song titles: Kittens Got Claws, Slow Poke Music, but you also have Coverdale impersonating Robert Plant: Judgement Day. Does anyone recall Kasmir? I am a big Whitesnake fan and I think Coverdale is a great lyricist. But this album was written just to sell as many copies as possible. The only redeeming songs are Sailing Ships and Fool for your Loving and that song is a remake from the Ready an Willing album"
2,Dave goes techno-rockin',"""Slip of the Tongue,"" historically speaking, is not a Whitesnake album in the least. Coverdale's blues-metal roots have been peroxcided and babes-with-big-boobed out. Steve Vai, while a landmark guitarist, is not a Whitesnake kinda guy. Flash, sparkle, and glitz. What happened to the band that recorded ""Ready an' Willing?"" Unfortunately, it was all about fame and fortune, not heart and soul in the last days of Whitesnake."
3,Slip of the Tongue not a slip-up,"First off, I have become much less generous with my ratings. So just because I only give this CD 3 stars doesn't mean I don't think it completely rocks. With this album, Whitesnake successfully balance the air of authenticity that their classic rock material has with a late '80s pop metal feel to create something powerful, classic, and accessible all at once. Whether Steve Vai is the right man for the guitar job is another matter. There's no question that the Vai-ster is arguably the technically most proficient guitarist on the planet, but his whammy bar frenzy of a solo on Cheap an' Nasty is completely wrong.Never mind though. With songs as good as these (and for the most part they're excellent), who needs great solos? And when Steve does get things right, he's incredible. Buy this CD, if only for the monstrously killer anthem that is ""Now You're Gone""."
2,poorest album of Coverdale,"Dissapointed line up with unsatisfied album,...I hate this last Whitesnake album,..... the songs are not good anymore,...the only one song I have appreciated , was the deeper the love! I still love and preferring the Whitesnake first line up with Mickey Moody, Bernie Mrshden, Jon lord and Ian paice... This line up is a big mistake! Iwas unhappy,...."
5,Another Exceptionally Great Serpent,"Whitesnake's 1989 album is another winner being a nice follow-up to ultra superhit WHITESNAKE. It is extention of the 1987 album for sure but this time the sound becomes much more classic a bit remnicent of David Lee Roth/Van Halen. Well balanced in soft ballads and straight ahead rockers.The most impressive of the straight-aheads is WINGS OF THE STORM This really kicks! And NOW YOU ARE GONE is exactly the perfect style of power ballad I had been dreaming so long. The last one SAILING SHIPS is pungent with classic hard rock masters, a bit remniscent of Led Zeppelin's STAIRWAYS TO HEAVEN.They are truly the band true rock fans want it back! Essential for 80's melodic rock fans."
3,Worth a listen.,"Slip of the Tongue is a good album from Whitesnake. There is a total of ten tracks included. All of them are listenable. The album's musicianship, songwriting, and production are tight and satisfying. The musical direction of the disc is melodic hard rock. Steve Vai does a really nice job with the guitar playing, and David Coverdale does an effective job with the vocals. The tunes that I like the most are ""The Deeper the Love"" and ""Judgment Day."" Steve Vai's guitar solo on the album opener ""Slip of the Tongue"" is also skilled and sounds really good. Whitesnake did a pretty cool job with this album. It's worth a listen."
5,music review,Very good music and singing. Came on time. I ordered it for my sister so she could get a specific song and the whole tape is wonderful. Thanks!
1,Am I blind or did I miss what the strength of these are?,Nothing printed on the bottle - nothing in either the title or the product description of what the mg strength is.Don't you find that sort of scary?
1,This picture is not what you are buying!!!!!,"This description clearly describes the product as a painted golf bag measuring 8""x5""x5"". Kit includes a corkscrew, bottle opener, etc. Wrong! Kit is a plastic toothbrush tumble containing a very flimsy corkscrew, bottle opener, etc.I called The Golf Warehouse three times prior to purchasing (to confirm that the chiller had a top) and was put on hold in excess of 30 minutes every time. Finally I decided since it was nearly Christmas I'd better buy it.This piece of crap finally came in the mail one week before Christmas and when I called to discuss their blatant false advertising, they said they'd accept the return but shipping and handling were my responsibility and were non-refundable.I do not reccommend dealing with this company because you can't really be sure of what you're buying!"
5,wonderful!,"A sweet little book all about sewing. Written in 1949 it covers a multitude of subjects even how to upholster a wing back chair, make draperies and anything else you can think of even a hat! It's vintage. Basic and sweet illustrations."
2,Absolutely frustrating,"I have to agree with everyone else here when they say that this book is absolutley packed with grammatical and coding errors. I already have a basic knowledge of PHP and a strong grounding in other languages so at first it was easy for me to see the errors and correct them, but now that I'm getting into the more complicated apsects such as file handling, I'm getting super-frustrated trying to figure out why things don't work. It has more errors than a Friends of Ed book. I'm going back to the store and picking up the O'Reilly book. They've never let me down."
2,"Easy to use, but watch out for typoes","I am learning quite a lot about using PHP and MySQL to create webpages, as the title promises, but the challenge is fighting my way through the lackadasical copyediting. When a six-line script has two typoes in it, as does one on page 29, it doesn't exactly fill me with confidence as to the rest of the scripts. Hopefully the second edition will be copyedited a little more closely."
2,Not for beginners,"Overall I found this book to be very frustrating. I have some programming and web experience, but not a lot. This is my first effort at creating a web page from scratch rather than updating an old one. I will start by being positive. What I do like is how the author explains the scripts used in the exercies. He starts at the beginning of the script and says what is happening as the script progresses. Now for the negative. This book is poorly written. Typos abound, including in the scripts. It is very frustrating to spend time trying to figure out why a script won't run when you've typed everything in as you are told. It is also not written very professionally. The language tries to come off as a layman, however the bad grammar and incorrect punctuation makes it come off as ignorant."
4,Fine for a beginner,For a beginner like me the book was just great and I appreciated having the CD so I could easily copy and paste the code snippets.It could have assumed more than just a linux audience as there were one or two difficulties I faced as a windows user.
4,Gorgeous Flatware,"****This flatware is simply gorgeous, unique, and worth every penny of the cost. They are lovely and heavy, the highest quality.However, I have to let you know that they come with an iitala sticker on each and every piece that must be removed--after this the sticky residue that remains cannot be easily removed. I don't have a dishwasher, so I couldn't try that, which would have been my first choice. Instead I had to use Goo-Gone over and over again on each piece and scrub. It took me about a half hour or so to completely remove everything from all five pieces. I was glad I had only purchased one place setting.Other than that, I think anyone would be extremely satisfied with this delightful set of flatware!Recommended, except for the labeling.****"
3,"Great, But...","Everything was just as described, with one exception. The item description indicated this set was made in France. Indeed, it said as much, right there on the box when it arrived. Maybe it's the packaging that was made in france, because each individual piece of silverware had a sticker on it indicating China as the country of origin."
4,Cute,"It's a tweeny movie for sure, but could family fare. The acting is predictable but Bob the horse is beautiful (the Gypsy Vanner breed is highly under rated. They are a smart, gorgeous breed of horse). A good family night movie."
5,So soothing and relaxing!!!,"her warm voice is as beautiful as this young girl looks... ""fly me to the moon"" is one of my favorites. whenever i listen to that it just blows me away... very talented singer!"
5,Absolutely Amazing! Best Band Ever!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the most overlooked band ever! It was a shame to see the music scene change because this CD is a work of art! Nuno is a genius! He and Gary Cherone can sing together so well! I had the cassette but wanted the CD! I bought it and was dissapointed to find there was"" Don't Leave Me Alone"" missing! I am so glad I kept the cassette! The whole thing tells a story and shows the most amazing talented band!It is a shame this is now out of print. I was so excited when VH1 did the special on Bands Reunited! I really wish they would have gotten back together! Anyway this is a must have! All I can say is get it! You won't regret it! I really wish they were still around!"
5,One of my all time favorite albums,"This album ranks in my top 10 of all time. It's not all about the lyrics for me, but the quality of the recording that blows me away. I have rarely heard a better mixed album. A glass of wine..some great headphones, and you are in for a great evening of listening pleasure. I am glad to see they are doing a few re-union dates."
5,Fantastic - Simply fantastic,"I remember back when this album first came out, Extreme was my favorite bands at the time (still ranks in my top 3), and I could not wait for it. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. This is one of the best ALBUMS I have heard in my life because it is an album, not a collection of songs. ""Everything Under the Sun"" is still one of the best songs ever written, and is EXTREMEly (pun intended) underrated.This album must be heard to believe, and everytime you listen to it, you get a new perspective on how special this album is."
4,"First ""side"" is the best","The first six songs on this album are what the guitar players out there want to hear. Nuno, Nuno, and more Nuno. Tasty licks, fascinating chord progressions and inventive, lightning fast scales. The rest of the album gets bogged down in its attempt to be socially relevant. Whereas more desireable than the usual hyper-hormone adolescent tripe peddled by otherwise talented bands, it's not exactly courageous to take an anti-war stance as Extreme has with this album. The point is eloquently made within the first six songs (with tongue firmly in cheek)and they shouldn't have belabored the point for 43 more minutes. But if you want to listen to Nuno, buy it."
2,Disappointed,"After hearing ""Rest in Peace"" and ""Am I Ever gonna Change,"" I was expecting this album to be better. The album is too lite, and has too many songs with pianos, and some also have orchestras. This albums isn't as rocking as ""Pornografiti,"" and is a decline in quality. The only songs I like are, ""Tragic Comic,"" ""Rest in Peace,"" and ""Am I Ever gonna Change?"""
5,"Great Memorable Album, but there is a track that's missing!!!","Great Album from start to finish, however, the track ""DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE"" does not appear on the CD as it does on the cassette. ""Warheads"" is a tough song to figure out if you're a guitar player, nevertheles, I'll be practicing my butt off on that one. ""Rest in Peace"" is a masterpiece itself, followed by the funky cut ""Politicalamity"", Nuno Bettencort pulled some Hendrix riffs on a lot of these tracks like ""Cupid's Dead"" (the Non-Horn version), and Peace Maker Die, the one that touched me the most because they dedicated that to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Overall great album but I still would like to have that missing track on there."
3,Some Great Tunes,"I'm not real big on musicians taking political stances because their opinions on such topics are basically meaningless. This record is anti-war themed, but that isn't why I bought it. I always thought this band was underrated and didn't get the respect they deserved for cranking out some pretty good music. Nuno is a great guitarist and his play is what got me interested in the band. I think most of this album is not that good. The band tries to mix ballads and elevator music into their metal/rock. They show that they are a multi-dimensional band. I was into only 3 songs, which i think are really good. My favorite is ""Am I ever Gonna Change."" Nuno's guitar riffs are awesome in this song. ""Warheads"" and ""Rest in Peace"" are my other favorites. I really did try to be objective in listening to the rest of the record, but I never could get into anything else but these 3 songs. However, they were so good that is why I bought it in the first place."
2,Mediocre,"Ugh. This wasn't that good when I bought it (before the internet, I made many such mistakes), and age hasn't improved it a bit."
4,This remains Extreme&#65533;s most ambitious attempt,"For some reason, Extreme never REALLY became a big name. At least not in Europe. Which is a shame, really, 'cause it used to be a great band, with a lot of musical talent, and a continuously developing style so that you can tell each album from the others!Extreme's most ambitious and most grown-up release was III Sides To Every Story. It is divided, or sampled, into III sections, called Yours, Mine, & The Truth, the last part only containing one long epic named Everything Under The Sun - a composition creating a great final to the album!...and to the band itself. 'Cause what Extreme has released since this one, is simply not worth it. It faded out, it lost the joy.III Sides To Every Story is album telling a story all the way through. It is a great piece of work, with beautiful musical moments. Though I still prefer the band's second release Pornograffitti."
4,"slow to get going, but worth it","Starts off slow, but its worth the effort. There are plenty of good nuggets in this book."
1,"I baled out by Chapter Two, too boring!","I never finished reading the book because it is so full of trite aphorisms. Sorry, but I can not recommend it."
5,Wildflowers of Houston and Southeast Texas,"I had to have this book!!! I really enjoyed the beautiful pictures, even thought a lot of these wildflowers are actuallly considered a weed in the Houston and surrounding areas. I've lived in this area and never really knew the names of the flowers and found this book very helpful. It also will let you know which plant is poisonous and which is edible. And it is about the size of a field guide."
4,Great Fun!,"A great game! A wonderful combination of stategy, great graphics, a variety of interesting playable characters, variable weapons, and interactive scenery! The graphics are the best of any role-playing type game I've seen!My only critisism (but a significant one) is the lack of adequate ""save areas"". If your character dies before completing a level you start from the beginning (all over again) every-single-time. Since many of these levels are very difficult this means you repeat the earlier portions of certain levels many, many times. I confess. I actually went on-line to get the invincibility cheat-code so that I could complete certain very frustrating levels. This is the only thing that keeps this from being a 5-star game."
2,Non-Intuitive Controls Drive Ya Nuts,"If you're looking for something along the lines of Balder's Gate this is not the game to get. The story line is okay, but the controls are not intuitive and hard to figure out. If you are used to using the buttons on the XBox controller then this will drive you nuts. The weapon and shield controls are the triggers which I thought completely ridiculous. And, you can't really customize the controls the way you want. If you want to try it rent it first. I played one night then returned it. Another annoying thing is there isn't enough health potions. Another thing is the turning and movement thing. You can't turn when moving like forward or backward. So, if you're trying to attack an Ogre, and he gets behind you, you have to use the left thumbstick to get behind him and the right thumbstick to turn around while you try and hack him, so then you're hacking at thin air. Overall very disapointing. Decent graphics though."
4,"Everything about it is wonderful, except...","Its frusterating as hell. The gameplay is wonderful, and while the storyline and mid-mission cinematic scenes aren't the best, the overall experience of the game is fantastic. The only problem is that it's so darn hard. Not just that, but there are no mid-mission saves, and so when you are killed, you have to play the whole level again. This is very frusterating. But, when I was replaying the levels over and over again, I just tried to immerse myself in the wonderful gameplay and enjoy the fun and try not to think about it being the tenth time I played the level. The traps, unlike some reviewers said, aren't that bad. Most can be seen before-hand, and the few that can't generally don't really hurt you enough to worry about. Anyhow, enough said. This game is truly entertaining, but I wouldn't recommend it to the casual-just play a little here and there for fun-gamer."
2,Great Graphics....,"First, let me say, Enclave has beautiful graphics. But after playing it awhile, I found myself frustrated by my inability to generate my own character, or to be able to start out with a character of my own gender (female). True, later on, you can select a new character at each level, but after a while, I just found myself NOT caring about playing any further.I prefer games with a little plot and a LOT more diversity at the get go. Enclave just failed to grab my interest."
3,Almost,"They almost had it before outsmarting themselves.Iwas expecting this to be the one but,it's not.I likethe controls and the graphics are sweet but thatswhere it ends.All they had to do was put the gamerin another world and get out of the way.Instead youget foolish missions that serve only to undermine thecontinuity of the game.I never really felt I was in-volved with a quest,just completing challenges.You can'tjust suit up and go out exploring and that ...[ticked]me off.Take a hint from Halo or Morrowind next time and kindlyget out of the way."
2,"It's about as ""mature"" as a round of Donkey Kong","Enclave takes a great story and reduces it to a series of obstacle courses. The levels do little to progress the plot, involve the character, or introduce any new characters (when a new one is introduced, their usually just standing in the middle of a level with no explanation). And, gues what? You get to replay each level over and over until you've memorized where all the ""barrels"" fall. And your reward for completing the insane levels which have no save points? Not even a descent cut-scene. Sound like fun? No, it's really not. For the mature gamer? Ya, meaning your 40 and still enjoy ""Asteroids."" This is not ""Thief"" of ""Thief 2."" They had detailed stories and characters... and mid-mission saves."
2,Rent before you buy.,"Grafix, good artsy goes with the mood. Only good point!Theam and Story, been done to death, nothing new or interesting.Run aorund trying to kill things.Controls, slow and awkward, can't aim at all.Action Combat, There is no combat system at all. Run around swinging wlidly and hope you eventually kill something.Challenge, with out aim or combat system simple weak monsters are potentially deadly, Only cheats may help.Over all, this is two stars worth of game, thats all."
4,"Love it, but some parts are just impossible!","Fun game, great environmental graphics, but framerate a bit slow in some parts when the action cranks up. Overall, love the game, but find the ""god mode"" code from the 'R' Zone section on Amazon to get past the incredibly hard parts. You can always go back, play those parts again in regular mode if you don't like cheating. Trust me, you will need to cheat to keep moving forward in a couple of spots, just to keep playing and interested."
5,Wubb Idol,"If you love Wuzzleburg then Wubb Idol is a no-brainer! Extra long feature with more content then I think ever made it to the DVR. My niece loves Sparkle, Shimmer and Shine and so will you with Beyonce as Wubbzy's musical co-star. Her voice along with the upbeat mood and message of ""Wubb Idol"" will have the whole family singing and dancing. Wow wow!"
4,Cute but long,"Wubbzy is great and we love to watch him and his friends. The movie is very cute also. My only con on this is that the movie is 90 mins long and that is a bit much when you are used to 15-20 min episodes. We all needed to watch it in two parts because our attention span is diminshed. I have a boy and he loved it. I think girls would love it even more, but that's just my opinion."
4,Awesome christian Hardcore!!!,This cd sounds exactly like if rage against the machine went christian. I saw these guys in concert and they were great. I like being able to listen to hard core and not have to hear all of that swearing.
1,Nothing like the other two Spoken CDs,"First, let me say that I absolutely love Spoken. ""Moments of Imperfect Clarity"" is one of my favorite CDs and I never get tired of listening to it. ""Echoes of the Spirit Still Dwell"" also has some amazing tracks. Unfortunately ""On Your Feet"" sounds nothing like the two aforementioned CDs. ""On Your Feet"" sounds more like Spoken trying to sound like Rage Against the Machine. I love Rage Against the Machine, but Spoken isn't as good as Rage, so to me this CD was a disappointment. If you like rap-core that's more on the rap side, you might enjoy this. If you enjoy hardcore, and Spoken's other CDs, then you'll probably want to pass this up."
5,Excellent Collection of Kitano/Hisaishi's Best,This CD is an absolute must have for Kitano fans. The CD includes the best tracks from each of Kitano's movies from the 90s which they collaborated on. Several of the tracks alone are worth the high price. It's worth every penny.
2,Heres what I think of the Songs,Do the Bartman = 4 stars and a half School day = ** Born under a bad sign = **** Lisa Blues = **** Deep deep truble = ***** God bless the child = * and a half How I'd love to see you smile = * Springfeild soul stew = ** and a half Look at all those idiots = **** Sidling Rivolaty = ***
2,Howlingly Unfunny Debut,"While not quite as bad as the Kent Brockman title quote would make it seem, this CD is nowhere near as durable, nor venerable, as the institution known as ""The Simpsons."" Oddly enough, ""Sing The Blues"" remains their best-selling effort, and features the chart hits, ""Do The Bartman"" and ""Deep, Deep, Trouble."" There would be better to follow, with, and apart from the cast, as ""Go Simpsonic"" and Dan Castellaneta's ""Two Lips"" would later reveal."
4,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The CD Was Great esspecially ""Bartman"" , ""Deep Deep Trouble"" and ""Sibling rivalry!!"""
3,Some were good,That tape was okay.The Bartman and Deep Deep Truble were great!School day and Born Under a Bad Sign weren't that great.
2,BROKE AFTER 1 year!,I have been playing with this lightsaber for one year and it broke! I cant get it to light up! DO NOT BUY THIS if you plan on using it for 1 or more years
4,"That logo is Pink, otherwise great product","I bought these to wear for basketball and running and while the headband is comfy, absorbent, etc. However, what they don't say, and what the picture doesn't clearly show, is that the logo on these headbands is pink, which sadly, is not really a color that a big guy like me wants to run around on the basketball court wearing. Oh well, at least my wife got some nice head bands.I'm giving the product 4 stars because they're great headbands, just beware the coloring if you don't want to wear pink. . ."
3,Like DocksLocks but fin cleat screw is too short,"I just got my DocksLocks system today and tried to install it. The system is simple and easy to use; however, the screw for the fin cleat is too short for my fin box. So I tightened the screw all the way and it still didn't hold in place. Like it says, it's a one-way screw so I needed to remove the screw with a vice grip pliers. I wish the screw was a bit longer so it would lock in my fin box. Good thing is I have a leash plug so I guess I'll be using that to lock my board. Other than that I would say the DocksLocks system is a good one."
5,High Fashion at a very reasonable price,This bracelet is uber-hip and very well made. I have it in green but might have to get all colors :). I really love this company (and their mission) and their stuff makes great presents.
3,Pyrotechnics,"The standard complaint about Vernon Reid is that his playing is full of empty pyrotechnics. I saw him live with James Blood Ulmer, and he blew me away! I picked out this disc almost randomly, and I have to say, recorded, he doesn't do much for me. Yes, on a technical level, he's an amazing player, but none of this moves me."
2,Contents,Seems Amazon for to include the contents so you'll find them below. Its a ok DVD but if you have the Ultimate Silly Songs then you have the better version of this..Veggie Tales Sing Alongs: Doo the Moo ShooLove My Lips [2:04]Belly Button [3:29]Endangered Love [4:15]His Cheeseburger [2:58]The New and Improved Bunny Song [4:23]Gated Community [1:55]School House Polka [2:29]Do the Moo Shoo [2:22]Larry's Blues [:49]Share of Friends [4:10]
5,"Does its job, good value","Im doing this reveiw through my parents account (just a note). I used this to upgrade my 333 imacs ram from 96 to 160mb and it works beuatifully. My brothers (2 out of 3 anyway) agree that its much faster. Next step is a 7200 80gb hardrive instead of the 4500 6gb standard drive so i get enough room to upgrade from jaguar to panther, if you want to do this remember to make the 1st ie the system partition smaller than 8 gig. Im going for 7 to be safe. Hoping to squeeze 3 more years at least out of this system but im sure i can do 5 or more with some cooperation from the users and maybe even a 10k rpm drive. Bottom line this ram worked well for me. Sorry for documenting the ""imac 333 upgrade saga"" just sharing."
1,SO DIMM PC100/PC66 comes in different sizes (height),"Do the research before buying.PNY 128 MB Notebook SO DIMM PC100 SDRAM Memory will not work with Dell Latitude CPi D300XT. Save the money towards the new notebook instead!Five Stars for Amazon Return Services, they are quick and easy."
4,great value,"this memory was originally purchased for my dell laptop but will not fit due to it being a full sized dim, however it did fit and work flawlessly in my friends compaq 1700. I have always had great luck in compatiblilty with PNY modules. just make sure your laptop can take a full size so-dimm"
2,Glassy,"If anyone thinks this is an acceptable recording of Beethoven piano sonata, then s/he has not listened to Emil Gilels, Annie Fischer, and Kempff perform these sonatas.Anyone who mistakes this for Pollini or Horowitz is obviously not an experienced listnener."
5,Well written and entertaining,"This novel is set in a fictional police state- a sort of Austro-Hungary in the tropics. It follows a lead character's brush with the authorities, and a deepening entanglement with the opposition. There isn't a ""Hollywood"" ending, which is also refreshing."
5,"If you want to code Games on the Mac, you need this book.","This is an essential guide to the tricks and finer points of Macintosh game programming. This book has the best examples I've seen in any programming reference. The concepts and programming tips are taught in a manner that help you go beyond what the book contains and develop your own methods as well.The writing is excellent (you can read this book like a novel, rather than just use it as a reference), and the topics covered are just what a beginning or slightly seasoned programmer are looking for - from sprite blitting routines that blow away what the toolbox has to offer, to multi-channel audio tips, to networking and AI development, and a great chapter on porting from Windows.I cannot stress highly enough how much help this book is to a MacOS game programmer."
3,Mac Game programming,"This book is outdated as the code applies to PowerBooks, but don't let that take away from the principles of game and graphics programming."
2,Okay for a while,"Well, this product was okay for a while. Then it simply stopped working. Looking back, I didn't care much for the functionality of the design, although it was cute. The water collector and the rubber gasket lid caused many cleaning problems. I've switched to a Zoji rice cooker with a removable lid. No problems. I'd check out that brand instead."
4,Jerk: BBQ from Jamaica,"The book arrived in excellent condition. I've purchased this book about ten years ago but I lost that copy. I had to get this book back because the recipes are amazing. I've entertained my family, friends and co-workers with recipes from this book. It is a must buy for those who love Jamaican cooking."
3,Not the best Jamaican,This book had some good recipes and some mediocre ones. I do believe that it would have been a much better book with some pictures. Who doesn't like pictures in a cookbook?
2,"This memoir is important, however...","I was really hoping this book would have good reproductions of Vann Nath's paintings. It does not. The reproductions appear as if they have been mimeographed, being reproduced in one color (purple!) and at very low resolution. Overall, this is a very cheaply printed book. Mr. Nath's story and artwork deserve much better treatment."
3,New York Beautiful by Wallace Nutting-Garden City Publishing De Luxe Edition 1936,"One volume of the six volumes in ""The States Beautiful Series"" originally copyright 1927 by Dodd Mead and Company Inc. The author personnally made every illustration but one."
1,Drive on...,"From the band that brought you the memorably abhorrent ""Everything About You"" back in 1992, sample this lyric: ""She was a good witch! She was a bad witch! But all I ever wanted was a motherf**ken sandwich! "" Artistic progression may have been too much to ask of Ugly Kid Joe who, believe it or not, were once marketed on the grunge gravy train. Motel California usefully clears up any confusion by rocking like Nirvana never happened, but even as bad heavy metal goes this album works only as unintended parody, like the scary growl that opens ""Little Red Man."" Still abhorrent, but far from memorable."
2,Tea connoisseurs don't squeeze tea bags,"This seems to be a device with little use, since squeezing the teabag makes the tea too strong and tannic. A few people do like a lot of bitter tannin, but most people don't. The only exception is green tea and herbal tea with a weak flavor. But with most teas, squeezing the bag is unwise."
5,Amazing musicians,"If you appreciate refreshing creativity and originality instead of the same old same old, these guys will leave you slack-jawed. They are some of the finest musicians on this planet. If you get a chance to see them live,DO NOT MISS IT! Their blend of jazz, bluegrass and rock is absolutely unique, plus they have a great sense of humor (Stevie Coyle used to be a standup comedian). I love this CD and their first one, ""Devolver,"" too."
3,A Mixed Bach,"Claiming to be an `authentic' performance the recording was made with a small orchestra using period instruments (3 first violins, 2 seconds, 2 each of woodwind, etc.) and a choir of sixteen voices (four to a section).Whether it's `authentic' or not - who can tell? - it is undoubtedly an odd, uneven performance. The solo singing is generally pleasing. The choir is energetic and vibrant but at times enthusiasm becomes crude and blustering, edgy, even raucous. This is how it may have been in Bach's Leipzig - we know Bach was often dissatisfied with his little choir. Perhaps this is what 'authentic' means!Radu's performance is not without some worthwhile things to tell us about this incomparable and inexhaustible masterpiece. At the price it's worth hearing - it's certainly different."
2,"Good soloists, but that's about it","I looked forward to hearing this after the rather good performance of Messiah by Maestro Radu. The soloists are very good. Another reviewer commented on the ""raucous"" quality of the choral singing. That's very apt. What ruins the show for me is the scrappy sounding orchestra. The yappy trumpets are the worst offenders. Spring for a few more dollars and get Gardiner, Leonhardt, etc. They are all better performed. If HIP isn't your thing, consider Karl Richter's very satisfying account on DGG."
1,""" Not What I Expected,At All ""","Not What I Expected At All. This Great Music Has Added Beats And Rythms.It Has Been Mixxed, Cut And Scratched On A Soundboard By Some Great Musician/Hip-Hop Artist I Suppose. Hence The Title "" Mastercuts Presents "". I'll Be Certain From Now On To Stay Away From Anything "" Mastercuts Presents "". I'll Simply Stick To The "" Original Cuts ""."
4,More Info,I have not heard the eintire CD but i believe that i did hear some of the songs on our radio station and ive been one of their fans for a while. You might look into another CD called PRECIOUS DEATH in actuality this group IS Blackball ( rather Pre-Blackball) only with a diffrent guitarist. It is much more heavy than Hope is (around the level of Stavesacre) but has that distinct Blackball quality to it.
3,"Not too bad, but not too great either","I bought the 7 disc set and was happy with the variety of the song selections. However, several of the songs are blurred on the screen and unreadable. Another issue I had is that some lyrics for a few of the songs are incorrect (I had to use a search engine on the internet to get the correct lyrics). If you buy these discs, do not have a high expectation for music quality."
4,Very Cute Book,"This was a very cute story worth the read not much more to say that everyone didn't already say. Read it, you'll like it. Enjoy"
5,wonderful set!,I love this set dearly and these three mills are the daily necessities for better cooking/dining enjoyments!
2,Looks good...,"We own an iittala pepper mill, and we agree it looks very nice, and the hammer-head mill mechanism makes it quite usable. However, we are more concerned with the ability to mill pepper relatively fine, not too fine, just not getting large chunks of pepper. At first, this mill did just that, but after a relatively short period of time, it no longer was able to produce the same fine grind. We will continue to investigate to find a longer laster fine-grind pepper mill."
3,"Bottle opener has sharp design, oddly lightweight, not sure it'll hold up.","Great design, but it's so lightweight you'd think it was hollow or made of aluminum, so I wonder how well it will hold up. I was thinking of buying a napkin holder for the middle of my kitchen table and using this as a weight, and still might, though it's lack of heft in your hand detracts from it's style."
4,I have one problem with this external kit,"The problem here is that that the usb connection to the case is not really the standard usb connection. You wont be able to plug a standard usb cord into the case, and likewise, you won't be able to use the case's usb on anything else besides the case. Its not the biggest deal in the world, but who wants parts that aren't able to interface with anything else? You will _have to_ take the cord everywhere with your case and if you lose the cord, then you'll probably end up buying an entirely new kit.On the positive side, the case has a nicely streamlined form and is easy to carry around. Everything works as expected with it.The only really interesting thing about this case is that it is small and looks nice. Do yourself a favor and purchase a different kit that uses a standard usb and has a firewire connection."
3,2001 edition not up to par,"This book didn't quite do it for me, I'm afraid. The main problem with the book was the overabundance of two-page short shorts (most culled from Nature). These things are worth reading, I suppose, and they're not as bad as Analog's Probability Zero pieces, but do they really belong in a Year's Best anthology? Ford's ""In the Days of the Comet"" and Kress's ""To Cuddle Amy"" could have been worthy of an inclusion here, had they been fleshed out a little more. With the advent of Internet -only fiction, short-shorts have become more and more popular as e-zines attempt to appeal to the average short-attention-span Web surfer. Call me old-fashioned, but I'll take a big fat novella any day."
4,Great start,"The art of the short story is disappearing. It is a joy when a compilation is released and it is very good. This is such a release. Are these the best of the Science Fiction genre for 1995? I don't know, but these stories are wonderfull. When I buy short story anthologies I tend to look for authors I have enjoyed over the years. The true gift is when I find an author I know nothing about or a new and rising author that is going to be fun to follow. This anthology has some of the big names such as Le Guin and Silverberg who both have written execellent stories. The true find for me was Nancy Kress. Her 'Evolution' is about a plague and the ramifications of genetic manipulation. Kress wrote 'An Alien light' in 1988 and I had lost track of her since. She is truly an amazing find. This book is well worth the time."
4,Good cooker,"I purchased this cooker over a year ago and it works well, both cooking and warming rice. You don't want to prepare rice really far in advance because it will dry out on the warming function over time, but it is OK for a day or two. The only thing I am not crazy about is that it does not have an off button--you have to unplug it to turn it off. It would be great if it included this."

A must for Snoop fans."
1,Pretty Good C D,Well was impressed with the CD at first but when it came to one of the best songs and videos on the CD Still D.R.E it goes blank half way thru the video to the end the song still plays but no video and since i really like that song i have to give the dvd a one star rating.....
2,bad tracks,Several of the tracks would not play or would mess up in the middle of playing. I could not return the items because the items were given away as gifts and had been opened and played.
2,Audio CD,"I was so excited to find karaoke Fleetwood Mac that I missed that fact that it was an audio CD. It sounds fine and I have had some fun with it, but it would have been great with some pictures or some thing to interact with. Had I not known all the words I would have been lost."
3,Good compilation for an average artist,"Recently I watched Frampton perform in a silly TV program here in my country.. I was takena ghast... What a long way downhill...at least, he really was capable of writing good pop songs in his career, and these songs are correctly portrayed in this compilation. Good."
2,movie on Wars of the Roses,"I read some of the reviews so that I knew that it would be less than desirable, but it was really hard to watch. The filming is so bad. Still, there were a few pictures that I could look at that related to the time period. I hope I can send it back for a credit."
3,"Got one, got them all...almost.","This book is laid out the same as the others in the series. Once you have read the first book such as, ""Successful Walleye Fishing"" you can skip reading about half of ""Successful Bass Fishing"" as it is laid out the same with the same topics. The only part that changes is a chapter or two specific to the fish species. If you are relatively new to the game and want an easy to read and very informative book, this is it. However, after the first species look elsewhere for a source of information as you will keep refering to the cover thinking you just read what you are reading.Lots of great photos and illustrations, easy to read text and can be read in one or two evenings."
5,amazing what a 73 year old can learn about fishing.,PAGE AFTER PAGE I LEARNED SOMETHING NEW. BUT EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE TO ME SO I WILL TRY THE NEW IDEAS IN THE BOOK.I MAY EVEN LET MY BROTHER READ IT. LOVE IT AND AM READING IT FOR THE SECOND TIME.
5,rim strip review,I bought these for an older English style 3 speed 1/38 x 26 EA3 rim. As part of getting the tires to seat properly I had to leave the tires overinflated for several hours. Everything works fine.
3,Quality item,"Not much to say. This is exactly what it says it is, no more no less. It is good quality, however and arrived on time."
3,Marginal,These are half the thickness and half the width of my current strips. I did not trust them to work so I installed them over the top of the existing strips. Used this way they are adequate. I would not buy them again and would pay more to get the item I wanted.
5,really cheap,cheapest and the best. if it was not so cheap I would not have even bothered replacing it when I replaced the tire
3,Took awhile to arrive...,"Not sure why this item took the longest to arrive. Had to wait on it to assemble a rear wheel. It came via USPS not UPS. This is definately a needed item, do not assemble a tire w/o one, ever."
3,"Okay, I guess","Okay, I guess, but that did'nt stop both of the tubes I ordered from going flat from the leaks that CAME WITH THEM. Thanks ALOT! Very disappointed..."
3,Buzz toy,This Buzz Toy is pretty good. My son likes it but did not care for the back pack part. He does not like that legs do not let the Buzz sit down.
4,Rescue Buzz was a long last hit,The Rescue Buzz Lightyear was a hit with our 2 1/2 year old son and has lasted through a lot of abuse.
2,Why did they make it the WRONG COLOR?,"Buzz is white and green. Unfortunately this version is BLUE...Furthermore: the old version of this toys had retractible wings, this one has a sad backpack... A cheapo version of a favorite hero."
5,Harriet The Spy Soundtrack amazing from what I hear of the samples,"The Spy Soundtrack amazing from what I hear of the samples. I have read the book but enjoyed the movie and it's score/soundtrack alot more. It has a jazzy tone for some tracks, some mambo and others are score bits. All perfect for one great cd, movies aren't like this anymore which is sad. Most are good but some are just crap. I will always love Harriet The Spy :D"
3,Buyer beware - understand what you're getting,"There should be a description for this product. Let me clue you in on what you'll get if you buy this. This is a 256MB upgrade, but it contains 2 128MB RIMMs. I should have tried to decode the part number.RIMMs need to go in as pairs. Order one of these and you'll get 1 pair of 128MB RIMMsfor a total of 256MB. If you want 2 256MB RIMMs (as I did, for a 512MB upgrade) this product is not what you want."
3,Not as riveting as I would have liked...,"It was an all-around good read, but I tend to go easy on short stories b/c they are so hard to write. ButI was honestly hoping for something a little more gripping. These were a little too tame, contrasting with the implications of the stories on the cover art and then synopses on the back."
1,The author got the basics wrong...,"The author states that ""green tea is the least processed tea"". This is wrong, white tea is the least processed of all teas. How is it possible you write a book about the ""tea basics"" and get this basic fact wrong? I stopped reading after this. This book is a waste of money."
3,Decent,"A solid album. Didn't blow me away though. I wouldn't use ""phat"" ""hard"" or ""driving"" to describe this CD for sure. More solid and soothing, with a bit of a charanga sound. ""Chibola"", ""Infiel Amante"" and ""Suavito"" are all good tracks. I'll be interested to hear their next album. I'd recommend this CD to persons with an already decent salsa collection. If you're just starting, there's more urgent purchases to be made!"
3,Okay for the money,"I bought this for my kitchen. I was mainly interested in the casette player for books-on-tape and in getting one far away, not-easy-to-receive FM station. To my pleasure it got the station, and the sound is better than I had expected from the price. The one thing I don't like is that I have to hang on to the radio when I push the buttons for the cassette player, or it moves all over the place. However, I'm not sorry I bought it."
5,"""Don't just a book by its cover!""","Do not judge ""The Conjurer's Bird"" by its name or book cover!I would have never read the book had it not been an assigned reading for our next book club meeting. I thoroughly enjoyed every page of the book; it was definitely a ""page turner.""Without giving details that might spoil the book for you that haven't read it, I will say that this book included mystery, romance, friendship, & history. And the ending had a few surprises for me!Looking forward to reading more books by Martin Davies."
5,The Conjuror's Bird,"Have owned book for some time, read it twice already. One of my favorite books, I've recommended it to my daughters.Equally as absorbing as Audrey Niffeneger's book ""The Time Traveler's Wife""'"
2,Ingredient List is Not Correct,"I bought this lotion because I really like tea tree products and don't mind the smell. I carefully read the ingredients list and thought I was purchasing a product with no added artificial fragrance. This is not the case. If you don't mind the artificial smell of cinnamon/sandalwood, you might like this lotion. If artificial fragrances bother, stay away from this lotion."
5,softer face,I love this lotion very much. My face is smoother and softer now. I use it on my face at night. My teenage daughter is now using it too.
4,Great on my skin,"This is a really good lotion. My skin is smooth and hydrated, it's awesome!My only complain is the smell. I don't mind the sandalwood smell, it's just so strong! But you get use to it."
2,Nothing special,This is a rather generic lotion. It doesn't go on that well either. All it does is moisturize; it doesn't seem that it actually nourishes all that much.
4,Good looking clock for Giant's fan,"It's a really fun clock in a young kid's bedroom up on the wall with the Fatheads and other Giant's stuff. The only downside is an incredibly loud ""tick tick."""
3,just fine,"I bought this whisk to go with my non-stick pans. Supposedly, today's non-stick pans should hold up to regular wire whisks, but I don't want to risk it. This one works fine, though I would stick to looser batters and mixtures, as it isn't strong enough for thicker viscosities. Still, for what I wanted, it does the job."
1,A real disappointment!,"Because the handle is so much heavier than the whisk part, the whole thing flips out of the bowl if you try to "" rest"" the utensil in the bowl."
4,Memorable,"I read this book 20yrs ago when I was 12, and really enjoyed it. Maybe I would find these books ridiculous today, but this book and series appealed to me enough in middle school that I can pretty clearly recall them, and I've always been a voracious reader who cruised through many long forgotten titles as a kid."
5,Never thought I'd ever hear his voice again,I had Shawn's 1st LP back in the 70's. Someone borrowed it & I never saw it again!! I think it was well worn by that time anyway. Life & other things took priority & I just forgot about it. But I never forgot Shawn's voice & have been looking high & low for his music until I tried a search on Amazon & there he WAS!!! I'd love to have that first one on CD. Until I do I'll just start collecting any of the CD's I can find!!!
1,waste of money,"The only good thing about this product is the price, but as the saying goes""you get what you pay for"" This ink lasted a small fraction of the brand name ink. I printed maybe 5 documents and the ink ran out. I even used the economical setting on printer so can save ink. Each time I called the manufacturer there was a answering machine.The first time someone called me back and said that they would take care of it and get back to me. Well they never did. Then I realized that I should of tried dealing with amazon insteadand they told me that the replacment time had already passed.So I was screwed. Never again will I buy ink from a no name company!!!!!!!"
3,Average Cher,"Cher's 1991 album signalled a lot of changes in her life. After this album, she wouldn't have a new one until 1995 with ITS A MANS WORLD (which is a fine album). In between she committed career suicide with infomercials, but luckily made a comeback in 1998 with BELIEVE. LOVE HURTS follows the 80s rock chick sound she had on her CHER and HEART OF STONE albums. Unfortunately, it doesn't work as well here. Cher sounds uninspired on a lot of the cuts, and at the end it's just a throwaway Cher album. However, there's some fine songs here. The two Diane Warren songs are nice, ""Save Up All Your Tears"", and ""Love and Understanding"". Her cover of Kiss' ""A World Without Heroes"" is inspired and worth checking out. I don't like her rendition of the title track though, it doesn't suit her and I don't like the arrangement given under her rendition. Luckily Cher retired the whole metal babe image after this album."
2,love hurts worst cher cd on geffen,"of all the cds cher released on geffen,and to date.love hurts is the worst.her version of love hurts is so horrible it makes my ears hurt.there are only a couple songs worth buyin this for,and they wear thin after a couple listens.the songs that stick out are save up all your tears(a not so great remake of the bonnie tyler song)and love and understanding."
2,"OK, but rather forgettable release from the diva","Cher's 1991 release Love Hurts is a mixed bag at best. The album boasts one surefire classic for Cher with ""Save Up All Your Tears"", but the rest of the album is a different story. Her remakes of ""Love Hurts"" (also covered on her 1975 STARS album) and ""A World Without Heroes"" both start out strong, but fizzle out fast. I was never too much a fan of ""Love And Understanding,"" the albums top 20 hit. On this album, you can tell Cher is tiring of the ""Geffen sound"" from her s/t 1987 and Heart of Stone albums, but she does wanna end the trilogy as good as she can. Only problem is that the material just isn't that memorable. The final track ""Who You Gonna Believe,"" comes as a relieve because after going through so many bland tracks, you get rewarded with a fun rocker that could've been a hit. The red hair cover (which was just reissued by Geffen) is worth the discounted price alone for this album."
5,Simply Inspiring,"This Christmas c.d. is my absolute favorite. I always pull this one out first when it becomes time for Christmas music. Amy Grant fans will melt at the beauty and grace this c.d has. Filled with wonderful songs of a hometown Christmas, far outweighs her former Christmas c.d. I recommend this to anyone who likes Christmas, Amy Grant, or brilliant music."
2,Not for Christmas traditionalists,"Having loved Amy's first Christmas recording, I bought this with great excitement. Unfortunately, I was bitterly disappointed. I guess I'm just a traditionalist. She handles the Christmas classics (such as O' Come All Ye Faithful) beautifully, but there are too few classics on this CD. With her cultural background, I expected more from Amy. ""Rockin' around the Christmas Tree"" is completely out of place here (I don't happen to like this song, but I guess her rendition is just about as good as anyone's). I like my contemporary Christmas music in small doses -- there is just too much on this CD. Maybe one day she'll record a more traditional CD and then I'll be back to rave about it. For now, this CD gets played maybe 3 times a year."
4,quiet and reflecting,"I have borrowed this CD from My employer, and can never seem to get too far without repeating track 4 over and over. From the first moment I fell in love with Breath of Heaven (Mary's Song) and am presently now in search of the sheet music for it. The melody is mysterious and keeps your interest, with the lyrics not only make you believe, but also reflect on how they incorporate into your own life. At some point we are all frightened and asking for support and assistance. I am recommending this to my friends. It helps with stress, whether you're driving or sitting thinking. If you come accross the music, please e-mail it to me, much appreciated! Megan"
5,Favorite Christmas song,My favorite Christmas song - Grown-up Christmas Wish - such touching lyrics with a melody that will lift your heart. Makes you think about the real Christmas
5,Excellent Mix of Jazz and Emotion,This is brilliant. You will have this theme ringing in your ears for a month after listening. I have collected around 25 to 30 J. Williams scores. This is wonderful like the rest...
4,Enjoyable music...even if you haven't seen the film,"Being the huge John Williams (and Steven Spielberg) fan that I am, I usually buy a new John Williams soundtrack (especially if it's from a Spielberg film) even if I haven't seen the movie yet. Such is the case with CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.This one is quite a change for John Williams. There's none of the typical operatic music that usually accompanies a scene that's epic in nature. Instead, everything is on a much more mellow tone. Although it may sound strange, it actually works.No, it certainly is no STAR WARS, INDIANA JONES, or SCHINDLER'S LIST. However, the themes are still both fun and relaxing. The songs from Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland fit in perfectly.And although it's slow in some parts, it's a huge step forward compared with this past summer's themeless MINORITY REPORT.Give it a try. You'll like it."
4,Catchy Catch Me - a light and lovely score,"This is not Obi-Wan's John Williams, but harkens back to when he was know as jazz guitartist Johnny Williams. The music is as light, upbeat and energetic as is much of the movie while having a character of its own. I particularly like the opening title song. It encapsulates the era, the movement and characters especially in his use of staccato-like finger snapping.Thrown into this mix are recordings from the era such as Sinatra's Come Fly With Me and The Girl from Ipanema (see Diana Krall's Quiet Nights for a lovely breathy rendition of Boy from Ipanema) that are so effectively incorporated in the storyline.A thoroughly delightful soundtrack from a master stretching himself into a very different sound than he uses in the big summer movies like Star Wars and Superman. Technically well produced (with the exceptions of the original recordings - they retain their limitations). A perfect champagne and bon bon musical experience."
3,Minimal Jazz Content,"The way people have been talking about this score, from the reviews to the liner notes, you'd think it was a stylistic counterpart to ""Checkmate."" In truth, there is minimal jazz or even pseudo-jazz content in this score. It is mostly orchestral with occasional jazzy touches, such as vibes or sax, but it's hardly a return to his days as Johnny Williams (as some have suggested). And the handful of tunes by the likes of Sinatra, Dusty, and Getz/Gilberto are readily available elsewhere in more appropriate settings. On its own terms, the score is certainly pleasant, but it's hardly a ""jazz score"" as defined by the likes of Mancini, Lalo Schifrin, Johnny Mandel, Kenyon Hopkins, and others."
4,A score that equals the movie,"I was impressed with the score written by John Williams. I saw the movie first, without ever hearing any of the music before, and it was very fitting throughout the movie. As you listen to the music pace pick up, you can remember back to a scene in the movie where the action is picking up. By itself, it's a music collaboration that is relaxing and enjoyable."
3,To Catch Williams,"2002 was an incredible year for John Williams because he wrote three film scores. Two of them were terrific: ""Minority Report"" and ""Star Wars-Episode II: Attack Of The Clones"". Yet I found his work on ""Catch Me If You Can"" average.Don't get me wrong. I think this is a fine album. In fact, I find his jazzy approach (à la Henry Mancini) interesting. The main theme is experimental, and it's well married to the opening credits sequence. The music for the audacious adventures of Frank Abagnale, Jr. is very refreshing. The suspense music -as heard in 'The Airport Scene' -is catchy. However, the rest of the album doesn't get me as much as the other two Williams scores, in spite of the songs performed by the likes of Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole.This is strange that I give this kind of opinion about this composition, since I am a John Williams fan, but I guess I'm going to stick with the other two albums."
2,Disappointed...,"I am a huge fan of John Williams but this soundtrack was a real disappoint to me. I knew it was going to have more of a jazz influenced score and I was psyched about hearing something different , but I wasn't blown away at all. I imagine the score works great within the movie, but as a listening experience this is a really bland album with very little thematic material. While listening to this album, I kept noticing comparisons to Jame's Horner's ""Sneakers"" score, but just not as interesting as what Horner did. Williams is continuing to take more risks scoring films (Minority Report), but at the same time he is not coming up with the great themes we've come to expect from him. If you're a fan of John Williams, beware - this may not be what you'd expect...See the movie first and then decide..."
4,Good MP3 Player for the price,"I got mine on Ebay so I got it for a little less than retail.I opened it and put a CD in I had burned using Nero. It was some OTR (Old Time Radio) shows. It just skipped all over the CD unable to play it. BUT.......I got a blank CD out took the CD and converted all the shows to 128Kbps instead of the 32kbps they were coded at.I turned Juliet off and made sure I Closed the CD.It runs great! Never skips. I wish it would show the title of the item playing but for the price it is worth it.I totally recommend it to anyone wanting an affordable MP3, CD player.I see that plate people have been talking about scratching their CDs and I can only think maybe they have a screw loose. No I mean it. Maybe it is not the plate but a screw loose on the plate it the problem. The plate is very sturdy so I can see it bending by push the buttons unless you are using a hammer.I give it 4 stars simply because I think it would be nice to have titles.Greate Item."
2,Not so good,"It has all been covered here, the skipping, the battery consumption, the total lack of web-support. I thought I was getting a good deal. In a way I did, since it only cost me 50 bucks to figure out that I'll never buy another Koss product again. At least I didn't drop big money on a high ticket item to learn this."
2,You get what you pay for,I bought the Koss CD/MP3 player on sale at Target (...) and it plays CDs and CD-Rs just fine the 45 second skip is great but with an MP3 disk it is very tempermental. It says it has been tested with 99 MP3 tracks on a CD and I have only gotten it to work with 50 MP3s and when I use the 50 MP3 disk it starts up and works maybe one out of ten attempts. I am returning it and I recommend spending a few extra bucks to get one that works. If you are not using it to listen to MP3s it is not bad.
4,"Great MP3 CD player, but it has it's kinks....","I got it for christmas (not even expecting it) with the Koss MP3 CD boombox (which works great). The thing is great! Skip protection works great, music is smooth and lush. The headphones were so great! About a 15 dollar pair i'd say! but...People have been complaining about skipping with MP3 cds. I found the problem.You cannot go past 160 quality. I burned a cd last night at my grandparents house (cause I'm cheap and dont have a burner). I tried 320 quality with MusicMatch jukebox. The songs stream VERY nicely on a computer, but don't on the cd player, nor on the boombox. I think that it's just too much on the discman.Still, its a good discman, and I love it!"
3,Not bad,"I bought mine 8/21/01, and I must say I am very happy with it thus far. I have had no problems creating and playing mp3 discs. Also it played CD-RW nicely. I play it thru my car tape deck with an adapter, and it still sounds good. I get the occasional noise, but I'm not sure if these are not related to the quality of the mp3's. Also, it doesn't list dir labels, but for the price, this thing is great."
1,Chokes on Large Files - I'm Returning It,"The Koss CDP3000 series is nice - when it works. Problem is, it doesn't work often enough for me to keep it. I wanted an MP3 player for playing OTR (Old Time Radio) programs - usually 10 to 30 minutes each. On two MP3 discs, the player worked fine for about 10 minutes - then would suddenly skip to the next track, leaving the previous one unfinished. The same thing would happen every time I tried to play the disc. On a third disc (with 120 10-minute shows), the player showed the number of tracks, but wouldn't play a darn thing. Without exception, these three discs all played fine in my computer. For what it's worth, the Koss sounds good when it's playing...but if you want to hear how your cuts finish, then look for another player."
4,Not a Bad Player,Even though many say that the Koss is not worth it I have had no problems. Well one I can say that it won't read my CD-RW's. It reads my CD-R's just fine. I burned them with Easy CD Creator 4 and never had to change any settings. Right now I have a CD-R with 240 songs encoded at 160kb and it handles them fine. The sound quality is great other than it declines when the bass is turned on but not badly. For me it works fine for school and car rides which I use it for. Highly Recommended.
1,"Bought it yesterday, returning it tomorrow.","I'm new to the world of MP3 CD players, and if this is how they all work, I'm going back to straight CDs. I spent nearly an entire day trying to get a CD-R encoded to work with the darn thing. What frustration. And when I finally -did- get a CD-R burnt that worked with it, the sound quality was reminiscent of a walkie talkie. LAME. There was this weird echo effect present in the MP3 playback that does not exist when the very same CD-R is taken to a desktop PC and played there. Also, the sound quality on CDs is bad, too. FWIW, I used RealJukebox Plus to encode from CD to MP3, and then used CDRWIN to burn the MP3s to CD-R.This KOSS unit is a shame, because I bought the KOSS unit since I was so pleased with their standard CD player, which costed me [price]. This unit, at [price] from my local ... store, is not worth more than [price] IMHO. I'm returning it tomorrow and picking up either the Philips/Magnavox unit, or the RCA unit. But this one is a reject."
4,O.K. I just got it at BIG ! LOTS (former Pic'n' Save),"...The player is great!!!! when you don't expect too much!!!!!!Reads CDR containing about 300 mp3 files approx.30 sec, CDRW - little longer. Sound quality is GOOD! but don't count on EQ !!! Display rather small but shows everything what I need to know what's going on, no search by song name, album or artist but how could you expect anything like this for 29.99?????!!! besidesyou can try to organize your mp3 files on CDR a little bit putting them into folders which are called by this player as ""albums"". not bulky at all, rather light and slim I would say, runs very nicely and DOES NOT skipp AT ALL in mp3 mode!!!I am going to send this player as a gift for my friend living in Europe since all mp3/cd players are far more expensive there. If you don't need ID tag support and ""good sound"" is good anough for you - just GO for it! For such price you can't go wrong!!!!!!!!"
3,less than expected,"i bought this cd player at target on sale... after i opened it i made a couple mp3 cd's with easy cd creator and nothing worked. than i used nero and made an iso data disc and that worked but it would skip so often. it got really annoying and i dont know if its defective or im using wrong software or what. i dont recommond this product unless your just planning to listen to normal cd's with it. if anyone else has this cd player and knows good software to burn mp3 cd's that dont skip, please email me ..."
2,"Nice Price, wish it would work correctly.","I bought the player and it plays MP3's but it LOVES to randomly skip ahead a couple seconds in the middle of a song and it also insists on making some kind of ""digital chirp"" in songs I know sound just fine. I'm using the ""LAME"" encoder and changing the settings does not seem to work. Oh well, you get what you pay for."
3,Thanks for the tip,Only by reading these reviews did I finally figure out how to make it read mp3s. I had to go back and burn the cd with Toast 3.5.6 because toast platinum throws mp3's intp mp3 mode. The Koss wouldn't read any cd's burned with toast platinum but what is cool is that if you burn the cd with Toast 3.5.6 using ISO 9660 format you can have additional sessions on the same write only cd by using incremental backup mode. Thanks for the tip Dave. It's too bad Koss doesn't tell you this!
1,Do not even consider wasting your money. Believe ME!,"I bought this CD player 2 weeks ago. The second I got it out of the package, it skipped like crazy. I was in denial, so I put in a regular CD. It sounded distorted and skipped like crazy. So I burned a new MP3 cd and tried it out. It still skipped. ... And here are some reasons why this CD player is now worth buying.1. It uses batteries like there's no tomorrow.2. It skips like crazy on both MP3 and regular cd's.3. The display shows no names, titles, just numbers.4. Huge bulky design. Does not fit in any pockets, no belt clip and heavy5. Headphones have the shortest cable known to man.6. LOUD!!! it makes a lot of noise.7. It has ASP (anti-skip protection) that takes 2 minutes to load for every song, and hardly ever loads. The thing says 45second ASP but when it works it's less than 10 seconds..."
5,Are You Ready?,This was a good movie. Much better than the Left Behind movie. Although the Left Behind books are awsome!
3,"Important to watch, but needs improvement","Important to watch, but I was expecting to see more about what was going on throughout the world during that time. What was going on with Israel and the famines and the changes on the earth taking place."
3,Okay,"A good sequel to the original, especially if you want to see the original characters. Not that good as a stand-alone feature, though. Do look for a subtle twist near the end, but you have to pay attention."
4,A beautiful book,"It's such a wonderful experience to read and hold a book like this. The care that went into it is evident on every page -- the type and the paper, the wonderful artwork. The stories are beautiful and true. Highly recommended."
2,Links not secure. Falls off my wrist repeatedly.,"I liked that this item was blank so I could have my own medical conditions engraved on it, but for some reason, this bracelet will not stay on my wrist. The links and jump rings are not secure and the bracelet falls off. I've lost it several times. I've had other bracelets just like this one, but never had problems with them. I don't know if this manufacturer just doesn't make as good a product as others or what. I only paid about $4 for this item, as opposed to the $10-12 I've spent on the same item at pharmacies, so I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Mild=aggressive,"I bought the mild sound muffler in hopes it would be just that... It's not, in fact in drones in the cab so bad the radio hardly takes care of it! Just know that if you want a mild tone muffler, this is not it. The seller is fast and efficient, my review is aimed at the muffler itself."
5,I'm buying this for sure!,"Boy, when I read those posts of people who were dissatisfied with this cookbook I decided I have to have it... for the very reason that they don't like it. If it uses soups and is like those wonderful books back in the 60's from your grandmother's church... then that's the book I want. I love those things, and using soup isn't something bad... it's a good thing for me! Who wants to put together all those ingredients that make up a can of soup when you can just open up one??? Not me!No one cooke better than the Amish and Mennonite women. And if it includes useful gardening and canning hints, that makes it all the more desireable."
1,Mennonite Country-Style Recipes & kitchen secrets,"I was very disappointed when I received my order. I had ordered the book only because it stated it was spiral, when I received it...it's not a spiral cook book. I will be returning the book for a refund."
4,Great cookbook!,"I love this cookbook! It's great for the new cook especially. It's really helpful for preserving, canning, and butchering. It also has a lot of helpful information as to why your bread, cookies, etc., don't turn out and charts for cooking meats, etc. The one disappointment for me was the binding on this particular copy. I have one that has the plastic backing and I think there are some with the spiral backing too but this one was just like a regular book (whatever that's called)."
2,Not what I expected,"When I bought this cookbook, I was hoping for old-fashioned traditional Mennonite recipies. I wanted recipies that called for natural ingredents, not cans of cream of muchroom soup.This is more along the lines of something your grandmother's church group would have put together for a fundraiser back in the 60's. For what it is, it's very thorough; it just is not what I wanted."
1,"Cheap construction, faulty design","Was very disappointed. Glass is beautiful, but that is it. There is a basic design flaw in that the ""arm"" between the lamp and the wall attachment plate is extremely thin metal. (I thought it was plastic to begin with). It is unable to bare weight of lamp, which is substantial. Ergo: when lamp was received ""arm"" had sheared off from weakest point: where it connected to the lamp. I only paid 7.92 (with discount) BUT it was not worth having it replaced as was obvious I would be courting danger by having lamp drop and shatter or hang with wires exposed (as within shipping box. I would have given 0 if it was available."
1,VERY poor quality,"I purchased 3 for under $10 each. Even at that price it is very poor quality.I have bought some incredible high quality deals at AMaZon, so I expected the listed regular price to be somewhat accurate. If I'd seen them in a store first, I would not have wasted my money. Maybe the high rated reviewer either lucked out, has poor vision, or isn't that particular about quality."
3,What do you expect?,The so called tiffany glass should be labeled tiffany plastic! But despite this what can someone expect for under $10.00. For China ware it was better than one could hope.
1,Wok/Fondue Combo burned out within 1 Year,I purchased this product about 1 year ago and I have used it about four times and the heating element burned out. I would not buy another WOK from Aroma.
5,Hello there you are!,"I have been looking for this for quite a while. The rocking band brings back memories...and wow, I now have it on CD. This CD is classic late 80's rock...a real must have if you rocked with it in high school!"
5,Where's more music from these guys?,"This CD rocks! The follow up, ""Sixes, Sevens and Nines"" is a continuation of the killer rock that is all too rare these days. Seen the band back in '91 when they opened up for Skynyrd and they rocked then too. Where are they now? Are there any more albums from these guys? Both albums are a must have for anybody who likes Southern style rock--the grittier the better."
4,Turn It Up,"I thought I was the only one who heard this band until now. I heard this album along with Dangerous Toys back when I was 17 when this girl was dating turn down the lights lit incence and candles cracked open some JD and fired up a joint and layed me out, more ways in one. Great drinking, partying, driving, or kicking back album highly recomended for any collection of underated hard rock."
3,Mistake,"Imagine my shock to see the label for this product, I was reviewing all the work I was doing to include the Amazon category Music and the Keyword Rocketown when this album came up!!!!Please correct this label, it is not a Rocketown label, it is a Geffen Gold Line Sp[...]To see what I was working on when I found this mistake, please visit this location:[...]"
4,Fantastic book but ...,"After reading ""The Pepper Garden"" also by Dewitt and Bosland I bought ""Peppers of the World: An Identification Guide"". The book gives you a very good overall view of the whole pepper family on the planet. Nice photos and good descriptions. However two things are wrong.First: For each pepper the authors should also have included a photo of the plant and the flower. Without that identification in many cases is almost impossible as many pods resemble each other very much indeed.Second: The metric conversion chart in the back of the book is wrong. Centimeters and inches must have changed places. The way it is now a 10 inch pepper like for instance Numex Big Jim is about the lenght of a thumb!! I dont think New Mexican commercial growers would like that. Keep that in mind if the publishers are contemplating a new edition.But otherwise - thanks for a great book which is a must for all pepper fans."
1,Chevy/GMC truck: Parts and Locating Guide,"I was real surprised when I received my delivery. Instead of getting a book, I received a poor photocopy of parts ads, dealer lists and covers of parts catalogs. I am not kidding when I describe it as a photocopy held together with a plastic ring binding that most offices stopped using years ago.Once I was past the amateur publishing and looked at the contents of the ""book"", I notice that many of the ads were the same ones that I saved back issues of car and truck magazines for. This ""book"" is mostly made up of pages listing dealers for parts or services, but with the internet and a few truck magizines, I could easily find most of the products.This purchase is going back for a refund. Its not worth the paper its photocopied on."
3,normal,It does not have adjustable strips...this influences a lot the look of this kind of clothes.In general lines I was ok...but I would pay less for this quality.
5,Bombshell works.,I have always tanned in a salon up until recently when I purchased my own tanning bed. I had used bombshell before every once and a while and never really noticed how well it worked... probably because I didn't use it very regular. Since buying my own bed that was the first product I ordered. Now that I can use it on a regular basis I love it. It has a great tingle factor (which I love) that isn't painful and doesn't turn me too red. I do not however like the after smell of any tanning lotions so I always take a shower right out of the bed. I have always been told and read that if you leave it on it tans you more. Not really my thing. But Bombshell works wondreful. I tan farely easy and once I start I continue to get dark. I love Bombshell and always have a bottle around. For me Bombshell gives me the results that I want!
2,Bombshell,"I have purchased this product many times on Amzon and have been very pleased, but this time I feel like the lotion may have been old, or watered down... Normaly I would get an intence burning feeling after application but not with the bottle I received this time. Hardley any burn and not as dark of a tan."
4,A Rousing Tale,I picked this book up at our library out of curiosity...a new author etc...I was not disappointed...it IS a rousing tale and i look forward to more of Mr. Baird's books....
4,One of the best rock bands of the 80s,"I brought this CD with my favourite songs being Waterfront, Alive and Kicking and Love Song. I was disapointed that the intro and the end of Love song were edited, as it was the intro which made the song. I also have a different song list on my CD, maybe a different one was released in Australia. It included See the Lights, Glittering Prize, The American and Ghostdancing and didn't include up on the catwalk or stand by love. Other favourites of mine were All the things she said, Belfast child, ghostdancing and Promised you a miracle. Every song on the CD was good to very good and it gives a true indication on what a great band they have been."
2,only two good songs on this album,"There are only two songs that are worth listening to on this album. Alive and Kicking along with Don't you (forget about me) are the only two good songs. The other songs on this album are just not even worth listening to because they don't seem to have that ability to make you want to listen to them. I'd buy it used, but not new."
3,Greatest Hits...Lite,"Far from comprehensive, this collection is ok for the casual listener, but lacks the strength to pull off showcasing the band.Offhand, the edited versions of ""Alive and Kicking"" and ""Sanctify Yourself"" really are somewhat disappointing; they just do not compare to the album versions.There are some catchy tunes here that aren't widely known, ""See the Lights"" just is impossible not to like, as is ""Belfast Child"". Everbody knows ""Don't You (Forget about Me)"".Crucial omissions from ""Sparkle in the Rain"" and ""New Gold Dream"" pretty much relegate this album to simply ok.Even the newer greatest hits collection falls short; Simple Minds can't be summed up in 1 or 2 CDs."
3,American version a ripoff? No kidding...,"Like the previous reviewer stated, the American version is indeed a ripoff. If you're a first-time listener to Simple Minds (and don't mind 4 songs missing from the European version), then get it. Otherwise, do get the European version (if you live in Canada or close to Canada, you'll get that version). That's the reason why the American version gets only 3 stars from me! The music in general is really great although I wish they didn't edit some of the tracks. If you're willing to move beyond ""Glittering Prize"", check out ""Sparkle In The Rain"", their best one EVER! Or if you want to experience them live, check out ""Live In The City Of Light"". Now, THAT is a classic in itself!"
5,HP Pavilion Memory Upgrade,"Specs on HP Pavilion called for 66 MHz frequency memory sticks, but this dropped right in and worked fine."
4,good product,There is an excellent concept behind this product. I love the design and the functionalities especially the house code feature. There is a little problem I encountered. The outdoor switch doesn't work when the server and the switch are on different circuit group(under different switch in the electric box). I don't know what caused that. I haven't spent a lot of time on that yet. Problem might get away if I leave that switch on the plug long enough to charge cell that keeps the memory of the code.
3,Great Value,"I think this product is a really great value, however i wish the range was a bit longer and i wish it had a few more options and maybe better controls. 1st i had the main unit plugged in my room, and it controlled everything in my room great, then i added the outside lights, and it would not reach. So i had to move the main unit to the living room to reach the outside lights, but then it would only reach some of the items in my room that are near the door, but not the items away from the door and across the wall. I wish remote had fading features like some of the X10 items that my buddy has. Remote does have a giant wheel whee i can control like a million items, but i don't think i will ever have that many lights or appliances to control."
4,Excellent value.,"These modules work well for incandescent and compact florescent lights. Programming the modules was easy and intuitive, however the remote control looks cheap and is a overly complicated.Overall, a great value for the price."
5,Excellent wireless kit with outdoor modules at a GREAT PRICE,For people who want security at night or when away from home this kit is great. I am disabled and having something that I can use so I don't have to travel in the house to shut of lights at a GREAT PRICE is Wonderful.
4,Fun! But a few recommendations,"Some reviewers here give these shoes a bad rap. OF COURSE you should wear a helmet and wrist guards with these shoes, just as you would with a skateboard. Then you won't be in danger of 'busting your head open,' like some reviewers warned. My 5 y.o. daughter and 8 y.o. son LOVE these shoes. They jumped and ran in them for hours - usually under my supervision. Two recommendations - 1) put on more rubber bands than recommended for your child's weight so they aren't so 'squishy', and 2) buy extra because they break kind of frequently. But well worth the active fun!"
2,Back away from the Moon Shoes...,"First of all, I am a 13 year old girl weighing 155 pounds. When I got the moon shoes I was 12, with a size 10 shoe- that was the first mistake, anyone with over a size 8 1/2 womens shoes size is going to have a fun time trying to put those on. Size 10 is totally out of the question-you're toes hangover the end, so you're toes bend back everytime you take a bounce. Secondly if you weigh over 135 pounds, you barely get a foot in the air. Just to clear this up; these shoes are only for younger kids."
5,Pretty cool,"I just don't understand why other kids aren't able to figure these shoes out. My daughter just barely turned five and picked out the purple moon shoes for her birthday. I'm a 26 year old woman, and I didn't have a single problem putting them together, it wasn't near as hard as other people have made it out to be. Now, I know that these shoes are for ages 7 and up, but I figured my energetic, boisterous wild child wouldn't have a problem. She LOVES them. I spent the first five minutes holding her hand and helping her balance, and she took off on her own after that. I will not let her wear them without supervision, as I'm a very responsible parent. She fell over a couple of times, but she's a kid, so she handles falls well. I don't see these shoes being any more dangerous than a trampoline. If my five year old daughter can handle these shoes, I don't see why anybody else can't. Just be a responsible parent and watch your kids closely, just as you would if they were on a trampoline."
5,Son is having a blast,My son tried these at a friend's house and couldn't stoptalking about them. Just had to have them. Seems like itis good exercise for the video game kid.
1,Moon Shoes,The quality of these were horrible. We were very disappointed in them. It's a great idea but the straps do not stay on.
1,horrible for chilren,"I""m 12. my brother bought these for me. they are made of plastic and the top has thick rubber bands. The highest I jumped was about 5 inches and I fell 4 times in 1 day. They are stressful to put together. I think they are very dangerous and could posible brake your arm or leg. I still have the marks."
2,Disappointed,"I just gave these to my two grandchildren, ages 9 & 11. In one hour I have had to replace 8 broken bands. These children fall well within the weight limit for the toy. I had the correct number of bands installed per the instructions. I am disappointed. Even if I can find replacement bands, I don't see us using this product much longer due to the frequency of the breaks."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought these for my 8-year-old son. He put them on and because of the size of the base kept kicking his other foot causing a fall. When he'd fall the base would not roll over with his foot as he fell. There really wasn't much of a bounce as I had expected. But these were just so bad. My son said he didn't want these now that he knows how they feel. We're returning these.
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!,i got theme when i was 7. i got these expecting id like theme but when i tried theme nothing happend ! unfortunantly i still jumped as high as i as i could but nothing happend still. my twelve year old brother tried theme but he couldn't either all the kids in my neibor hood tried well almost all of theme but it still didnt work i suggest you just save youre money.....
1,not exactly what I thought they would be,My 6 year old son received these as a gift for Christmas and I am very displeased with them. He put them on and within about 10 minutes he had already fallen down about 10-15 times. These shoes are being returned. I actually tried them on myself and got the same results. Before we make a trip to the emergency room for broken bones I think it would be best to return them and get something a little more kid friendly.
4,great toy,I think that this is the coolest toy ever.They work really well. I got almost 3 feet off the ground.You should really put this toy on your Cristmas list.
1,Dangerous,"The base, or ""footprint"" of this shoe-like toy is large. If a child loses balance, and falls, ankles are at great risk of serious injury. My grandchildren tried them a few times, then wisely relegated them to the trash. Could work better for teens but still dangerous."
2,Dangerous,I think these pieces of plastic with rubber bands are a waste of money. I wont let my 8 y.o. even put them on. He tried and fell on his head. If he cracked it open I would have sued the manufacturer. Dangerous is what they need to post on the side of the box.
1,Accident Waiting to Happen,"I'm surprised to read the good reviews. My kids got them for Christmas, and I put them back in the box after about 7 minutes. I would be waiting for some broken bones using these things."
1,0 Stars..... Not Recommended!!!!!!,"My 7 1/2 year old daughter tried these on at a friend's house yesterday. SHe had them on for about 2 minutes before she fell and got hurt. After a trip to the ER and the Orthopedic Surgeon, she has a fracture in her growth plate. Need I say more?"
1,Dangerous,"My 9 year old daughter is very athletic and excells at all sports but these things are difficult to master. Very large danger of ankle and leg injuries from falling and twisting the ankle. Maybe it depends on the body type of the kid; mine is tall and thin, built for speed not strength. Maybe a stronger kid could do it. These are going back."
5,If u dont have a trampoline this will b good 4 u.,"I dont have moon shoes yet,but i dont think they r awesome.I KNOW THERE AWESOME!I also want it 4 x-mas.I heard that u can jump in them and jump really high.But im not keeping promises cuz i havent got it yet.I want it b cuz my old trampoline got flipped over.I THINK these r 4 kids who dont have trampolines.So if u dont have a trampoline i would reccomend moon shoes.It seems like a good toy."
