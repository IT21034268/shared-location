4,A Latin artist that shows his music has meaning.,"Ricky Martin's ""Vuelve"" is an excellent album, with a lot of energy. My favorites include ""Corazonado"", ""La Copa De La Vida"" - which actually sounds a lot like his latest ""Livin' La Vida Loca"", and ""Perdido Sin Ti"". I feel his ballads are the strongest sets here, however the album gets a little repetive, that is why I could not give it 5 stars, a few songs sounded like copies of each other. However Rickys voice is in the finest of form, and I definitely recommend it. A performer whose time has come."
4,So sexy,"I had never heard of Ricky Martin before the Grammy's... and it was my roommate who bought this album. I don't know if I'll ever give it back. I won't ever tire of listening to ""Perdido Sin Ti""... his voice is absolutely unbelievable.. so smooth, so beautiful, simply mesmerizing. No doubt about it, i am a devoted fan now."
1,Already too old,"This album has become more than annoying due to the fact that it fails to project feelings of joy if you listen to it more than once or even twice. The latest track release ""La Bamba"" is way too overestimated. It is quite repetitive and the rythms are not very varied as well. I think you guys should try Heavy metal."
2,Not Good Enough,"I am a fan of latin music and I thought this one is gonna be a good album but Ricky continues with the same rythms and I was expecting more. Is not a bad disc but I think he can do it better specially if he is trying to compete with the master of pop music like Luis Miguel. The only song I like was Vuelve, I think because Franco de Vita wrote it."
2,More boring martin,"Let's face it, Ricky only sells albums because his pretty face, he is an awful singer."
2,le asen mucho wato a ricky,ricky es un hombre muy talentoso que merese ser reconosido pero yo creo que ay mucha gente que se pasa de darle su lugar. Yo no pienso que el debe ser conciderado el hombre mas guapo del mundo. porfabor amigos/as abran los ojos y pongansen a busacar a alguien como Carlos Ponce. Espero que no se vaya a sentir ricky. sorry.
4,I'm sure the lyrics are good...,"This is an awesome CD. Even though I don't understand the lyrids (despite two years of Spanish in high school and three quarters in college--I was not exactly a stellar student), the music and his voice are enough to keep me listening."
5,I must agree!,"I have to agree with just about all of the other reviews...this is a great CD. Fun music, great voice, and that face!!! Try cleaning your house to this music. You will clean so fast and have a great time doing it. Ha!"
5,"This is an upbeat, make you want to dance CD.","This is an upbeat, make you want to dance and marry a latino man kind of album. I truly enjoy every song on the album. I would recommend this to individuals who enjoy spanish/cuban dance music. This should be a definite addition to your CD collection."
5,Best Latin Pop Performance Grammy winner 1999,"You want to know how good this Cd is? Well, he won the Grammy for Latin Pop Performance on the strength of just La Copa De La Vida, which is not even the best song on this delightful CD! For those of you who saw how he nearly brought the house down at the 1999 Grammy awards ceremony, there's thrteen more songs for you to rock, dance and cry to. It's that good! Definitely my favourite album of the decade!"
4,This is an artist who deserves the attention he's getting,I first heard Ricky Martin in Europe a while back.MARIA was all over the radio it was easy to get hooked on it.This CD is a solid batch of tunes and Ricky Martin deserves special recognition for showing me what a great song GO THE DISTANCE is.Far superior to Michael Bolton's version.All the other tracks on the CD are strong was well. I usaully listen to alternative/modern rock music but this is one pop cd that I really enjoy. Highly recommended!
3,An ok cd,I think this cd would really be great if I knew how to speake Spanish. I like the beat. I just wish I knew what the cute guy was singing about!!
5,"None of that ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" stuff (which is a good thing)","This album truly showcases Ricky Martin's artistic sensibilities and abilities. He is talented and his interpretation of all the songs is wonderful. ""Lola, Lola"" has to be my favorite track and is full of emotion and explosive rhythms. His voice soars and his command of the language really displays his charisma, something that is missing in his English songs Â¡Que Viva Ricky Martin!"
5,"When you buy this CD, you will know why it won a Grammy.","In one word: maravilloso! If you've just recently discovered Ricky Martin, you owe it to yourself to buy this album. Even if you don't understand Spanish, you will feel the emotion in every song. This album will take you away...to another place...it's THAT good. It is by far the best album he has ever done...you will be haunted by these songs long after you turn off the music. Lola, La Bomba, La Copa de la Vida and Marcia Baila will have you dancing around the house, singing at the top of your lungs, while Vuleve, Casi un Bolero, Perdido Sin Ti and Hagamos el Amor will leave you breathless. Do yourself a favor and buy a Spanish dictionary - once you understand what he's saying, you'll never want him to sing in English again!"
5,Ricky Marting music is right on the target...,"Vuelve is a must have. If you feel 40s and 50s songs should be kept locked at a closet, step up to higher rythms and newer music. Ricky Martin does it again! Mr. Robi Rosa compositions, and arrangements deserve a lot of the credit This combination is certainly refreshing... I Hope there will be a song like ""Maria"" or ""Cup of Life"" during the ""millenium"" end party."
5,Yet another 5 stars for Ricky,"What's my humble review gonna do when you have more than 70 reviews for Ricky's ""Vuelve"" already? Well, may I say that if you don't have this CD, you're missing one of the best productions EVER! His lyrics are great, the beat is superb and the more mellow songs are just perfect for that romantic night with your SO. Buy this CD and thank me (and Ricky) forever."
5,Great CD with hot dancing tunes!,"Great CD, with hot dancing tunes. It makes you want to get up and dance, dance, dance. Especially La Copa de la Vida and La Bomba!I was an avid fan of Menudo and remember when Ricky Martin was known as ""Little Ricky"" and the days of ""oh, oh, oh mi amor"" (You Menudo fans know what I am talking about). He has matured splendidly and so has his music. Even if you don't know spanish so what go out and buy the CD it is WORTH IT!"
5,Probably his BEST CD ever!,"I have had this CD for about 4 months now and have not gotten tired of listening to it. Every song in this CD is awsome. My favorites are ""Vuelve"", ""Perdido sin ti"" and ""La Bomba"". I could actually listen to this CD every day and not get tired of it. If you're going to get one of his CD's make sure you pick this one. It won't let you down!!"
5,The musician of the new decade-Ricky Martin,"As a long-time fan of Ricky I have to admit that this album represents some of his finest moments as a talented musician. His elegance of emotion on ""Vuelve"" and ""Perdido Sin Ti"" as well as his raw passion on ""La Copa de la Vida"" demonstrate his ability to transcend any language, style and genre. This is the ""must have"" CD of the decade. Try it....you'll like it."
4,Great for frizzy and unruly hair,"We're Hispanic with very unruly hair. I was struggling with my 3.5 yr old since most kids shampoos and conditioners are made for silky soft normal hair, definitely not our type of hair. So I bought this @ Walmart and absolutely loved it! It makes my daughter's hair very soft and manageable and it smells awesome! I would suggest it for anyone who has unruly and frizzy hair. You don't have to be African American to benefit from this awesome product."
5,"a touching, well written book","i truely enjoyed this book as well as all the nodds ridge books. tabitha king has a talent for well developed characters that you can really care about.reuben styles is a complex well rounded character. i would recommend any and all of tabitha kings nodd ridge books, and im hoping for more. i want to know what happens to reuben next."
5,Great Book,The Book of Rueben is probably my favoriteTabitha King book. THe characters are great and I like it being set in Maine.
5,LOVE this book!,"Absolutely one of my favorite 20 books of all time. I always recommend The Book of Reuben, Pearl and One-on-One to people. I wish I could read all these again...for the first. They are fabulous!"
1,Worst Zatoichi movie ever.,Only for purists and completeists. This is just all sorts of bad and wrong. They were obviously milking the franchise for all it was worth by now. The only thing redeeming about this is that it woke up Katsu Productions and they created 3 very good films after this. But this is the bottom of the barrel.
2,Hong Kong Chinese Version,"I am now 61 years old, when I was a young man, my parents took me to a Chinese Theatre in L.A., Ca Chinatown to see the Chinese Version of One Armed Swordsman meets Zatoichi. The beginning is dramatically and tremendously different, the end part is the same except Zatoichi is more wounded and the One Armed Swordsman walks away seriously wounded.I have tried to get an original Chinese version and ended up with three Japanese version mainly because of misleading or vague advertising.In the Chinese version Wang intervenes and stands over the boy to protects him, the battle scenes between the Chinese and Japanese version are like day and night. In the Japanese version, Wang looks like an amature stuntman wannabe, it was terrible. In the Chinese version, protestecting the boy was masterful and tremendous. It is for this reason I wanted the Chinese version but there is some kind of business block preventing its disclosure and impossible to get!"
3,Wine Stand,We received the wine opener as a gift and did not want to clamp it onto our granite top. This table stand is not a sturdy as I would have hoped.
5,Way cool,They look good and they work like there suppose too. Easy to install....shouldn't take more than 30 mins.They keep the rain.
2,Did not fit as per Amazon Garage site check,"The back vents did not fit (not even close) on my '12 Yukon even though the Amazon Garage site check said it ""fits your vehicle"" in the top left of the screen when viewing the product detail page. I sent it back and assume Amazon will make good on the return. I then went to the vendors website to check and sure enough it was not the correct model number. While I should have been more diligent and done this first, I relied on the Amazon Garage check which was in error. I will now order the correct version and compare to the set of Wade vent shades I have on another vehicle. Other posters have said the rear do not fit either and I assume it is due to the same reason."
4,Ok,"I ended up getting two different sets. The first set looked great but apparently the back doors didn't fit my unit. I then got a second set to put on the rear doors of my truck, but they were a different style and had a different bottom edge. I truly liked the first set but the edges on the second set were less than desireable. Not sure why the difference in them, but the ones with rounded and finished edges look great. Would be a 5 if both sets had been the same design."
2,These Utensils Stink! Literally.,"I purchased these and more Calphalon utensils for my son and new daughter-in-law. Seeing how ""cool"" it was to have new, matching utensils, I decided to retire all my mismatched and rusting utensils. After all, I figured I deserved them after 30+ years of marriage.I used the turner to remove hash browns from my non-stick Calphalon pan and noticed an obnoxious smell. The edge of the turner was slightly melted and stunk! I trimmed off the edge thinking it was just a little extra plastic at the end.I just baked cookies and smelled the burning plastic again as I removed cookies from the cookie sheet. I now wish I had purchased silicone utensils. My next steps are to replace the turners and contact Calphalon Customer Service. And once again I'll have mismatched utensils."
1,"These Utensils ""Stink"" . . . literally!","When I received these utensils, I was excided because they had nice long handles and looked good! I was shocked to find that when they are in hot liquid, they give off an odor and a bad taste! Like another user here, my spoon melted some at the tip while I was sauteeing some vegetables. The taste was terrible. You can bet these will be going into the bargain bin at the next yard sale and I'm going to Wal-Mart to buy cheap non-odorous replacements!Doug"
1,Makes food taste like plastic,"I was wondering why my food often had a weird plastic-y aftertaste and after a few weeks, I finally found the culprit: my Calphalon utensils. I immediately stopped using them and now my food tastes fine. Functionally speaking, they work just fine but I can't recommend them.Update: I called Calphalon and they told me to send back the utensils with a brief note explaining the problem and they would replace them for me. I did so and they sent me a new set but unfortunately, they still smelled funny. I ended up donating them."
4,Good tools.,"Nice tools, don't scratch non-stick surfaces. Just don't leave sitting on a hot pan, they will start to melt."
2,utensil set,I bought this set for the name but other reviewers mentioned they had melted but took my chances and bought it anyways. Mine was no exception. I've noticed the tip of the spatula had melted by the second use with normal cooking tasks. I ended up scraping the melted plastic off but still plan on using them.They feel and look like good quality with the Calphalon name but I would not buy this set again and would try my luck at another brand.
2,Melted!,"I bought these utensils because of the bargain price and trusted the Calphalon name. But when I used the spaghetti spoon to get a tester strand from the pot upon first use, the prongs on the spoon melted off!!! I haven't had trouble with the other utensils in boiling water, but I'm pretty disappointed with Calphalon...being that my kitchen is stocked with much of their cookware."
5,Good take of his best songs,"I have no complaints about this CD. Most of the tracks are well-chosen for a greatest hits...I would have loved to hear Blue Minor and Summertime (from his Worldwide CD) and Bahia San Juan (from Villa Hidalgo) on this CD, but, for the most part, this is a good greatest hits CD."
5,"Good, solid drill","I bought this drill, and its 3/8"" sibling, and have nothing but praise for them. I found it more comfortable to use than my Milwaukee 0234-6, with plenty of torque, a very smooth trigger, and a very nice, heavy-duty chuck. The only thing I did not like about it was the leather chuck-key keeper; but this was easily replaced with Milwaukee's rubber version for cheap. Overall, a great purchase, especially for the price."
3,?????,Bought this drill a week ago .... after one day's use the variable speed feature gave out ... returned to the retailer for a replacement and didn't even get that one out of the store ... lube was leaking out of the gear housing. Took a third unit home and am hoping for the best. Positive side: ergonomically better than Milwaukee and cheaper too. BUT what's up with the problems I've experienced????
4,A very good read,"This book is crafted with a lot of thought. It tackles a variety of subjects from heartache to politics.It Is humorous, wistful, energetic,funny and reflects a rapier like wit. For all women stuck in a rut, the poem 'Emerge', should speak loudly to their hearts.Conclusion buy this book and have a heart to heart with it."
5,Brothers of the world UNITE !,"In the year of our lord, 1972, in a sleepy little backwater burg called Indianapolis, three bad brothers became one for the biggest, baddest one two three punch. Like draft beer night at Applebees, this jam kicks! Oldest bro. Kurt, summed it up best: ""Don't like it how its told? TELL it like it is!"" And in the end... it all was over."
3,Little too Sweet but Not Bad,"Considering this is a microwave instant type of food I wasn't expecting much from it. There is a good flavor overall, but the spices and noodles are overshadowed by way too much sugar - peanut sauce should be slightly sweet, but toward the end of the package it seemed like all you had left on the taste buds was ""SWEET"". Think I'll try another flavor next time."
4,A Step Up,"Better than a standard Ramen noodle, and better than the uncle Ben's bowl (if you can still find it). We cook peanut and Pad thai regularly in the microwave. Turns out great and a tastes great. Some are fairly spicy, but not ""3 alarm""."
2,Worse than Top Ramen.,"I usually don't review food products I purchase on here, but this stuff prompted me to do so. The texture of these is really disgusting. I tried making several boxes both in a pot and microwave and both ways made me literally gag. The noodles are cheap rice noodles, and the taste is something akin to salty peanut brittle. I have since tried a similar product by Annie Chun, which you can also purchase on Amazon and was far happier with the fresh noodles and ingredients in that product."
1,Awful,This may be the worse thing I've ever tasted in my life. It was awful for the taste buds and even worse for me. 1 box has 50% sat fat. I am staying away from any Taste of Thai food.
2,Too Dry!,"I followed the directions exactly and got stiff, dry noodles and a gummy tasting sauce. I won't buy again. Really wish I could return the other 5 boxes!"
1,Not For Me,"I usually eat out, trying to save some time and money I decided to take advantage of a special offer. I have not received the rest of the food I ordered but I did get this and give it a try. I reluctantly tried it a second time and confirmed my thoughts: this stuff is terrible, a waste of my time and money, I tossed the remaining four packages, I wouldn't even try to give it away. I am happy for those of you that tried it and liked it. I have spent thousands of dollars and made maybe 50 purchases from Amazon. This is only the second time I have rated something; maybe just letting out some frustration and trying to save someone from making the same mistake."
1,Too sweet for my taste,"I like the coconut ginger flavor of these Thai noodles, but the peanut flavor is way too sweet for my taste. I was hoping it would be spicy-peanutty. This is like a peanut butter and honey sandwich - only on noodles instead of bread. I'm glad there are other flavors!"
5,I love this!,"It's hard being gluten free and it's even harder finding quick easy dorm friendly food, but this stuff is great. It's delicious and easy and quick to make and virtually no clean up, assuming you count washing a fork and throwing away the carton even worth calling 'clean up' I swear by this stuff. Way better than the dining hall food any day.Update: I'm still loving this stuff. The peanut noodles are my favorite. You just have to make sure if your microwave spins that you fold the top down enough, sometimes they spill over, but I have a very, very small microwave, but it's still delicious food. Really hard to mess up too."
2,Did not like the taste,"I like asian noodles and I love Thai foods, but maybe it's personal taste, I did not like this. When I tried first box (out of 6) I could not finish. Months later when I was hungry, I tried the second box, and it was the same. I always order Pad Thai at Thai restaurant and I know how it tastes."
1,WANTON DESTRUCTION OF BEAUTIFUL MUSIC,"If you like Mari Boine's other CD's - don't buy this!I have all her music - she is very talented musician who has captured the essence of geography, time and rhythm in her music.This Remix is an electronic trip - the ""music"" and Mari's great voice are overwhelmed by the psychosis of the musicians inflicting their poor taste on what was exquisite.If this is where we are going Global Warming and the end of the world can't come fast enough!"
5,The Better Router Guide,"For handheld operations this is probably the most flexible guide, especially because it allows curved edging as well as straight. As well as making internal routing easier. It's solid and precise - as long as you take care to make sure everything is tightened down, and it doesn't get in the way. Works great with my 690.It's the price that is the real drawback. There really isn't a good excuse for this to cost even more than the 42690 edge guide, but apparently Porter-Cable knows that this is the guide to own. Unfortunately, they are right. As I've mentioned in another edge guide review I don't often need a guide, but this one opens up some new possibilities."
3,The advantages & disagvantages of the Official Soundtrack,"I really do love this game so much, in fact I was really happy enough that they actually got the soundtrack for it. With the Official Soundtrack you get pretty much all the main songs on this CD and, you can expect that you can't beat its rock-bottom price. However there is a major flaw at this CD and that is the tracks. ""Of course most of the people would expect to see that if they played the game, or have compared tracks with the Compete Trinity""What I meant about that quote is that you only have 3 out of 6 battle themes missing (Egg hawk, Team battle, and Egg Emperor), and in addition there are no exclusive tracks on this CD other than the Compete Trinity.Only get this CD if you don't want to spend a lot of money and don't care about other 3 battle themes. (as mentoned above)"
5,You just cant find better songs,"This has to be the greatest songs ever!!! the sonic heroes theme is rock hard, 'this machine' ROCKS, and ""what im made of"" is.. well thee are no words to describe it (in a good way). the limit may be 5 stars, but who the @!#$ cares?! I GIVE IT 142618352782538756 STARS!!! millons billons INFINITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS CD ROCKS! if you dont buy it, you are now in a cell in the mental institute."
3,Disappointing,"After the great tunes of Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 I was really let down with this quite dull CD. This time around there are no diverse tracks, no cool themes and no Chao music. Even a few remixes of original Sonic tunes would have been cool. There are about 5 decent tracks max, but that leaves 25 tracks of generic sound and that ain't good. I expect more from Sonic Team.The main Sonic Heroes theme is cool, as is a couple of the other songs but that doesn't make it worth the price unless you pick it up cheap."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased one 512mb ram thru amazon.com from ""newtech"" in Corona, ca. on 6/08/09 and it did not work. I immediately returned the ram card to ""newtech"" and they sent me a new one, however, it didn't work either. I sent it back on 6/17/09 and have not heard from them since. Let us know how to get a refund on this purchase. Thanks, barbara"
2,Drill clutch failed two times,"I have just returned the second drill because the clutch gave out again. After this let down I am going to Milwaukee for my drill/saw kit. I usually love DeWalt tools, they have worked forever, not this time. The saw works great now but I am worried it will quit in the middle of a job too."
4,"engaging and perplexing, just like a lot of people I meet!","A former student of Steve's, I was excited to read his collection of work.The characters who populate his novels are delusional, rife with feeling, and altogether ""normal."" This is, perhaps, a strange description, but Polansky's depiction of human nature engages and perplexes. It's like getting a glimpse into the heart and mind of that neighbor you haven't yet ""figured out."" After reading the stories, you may still not know what exactly makes your neighbor tick; Polansky tells the stories from the limited perspectives of his characters, but in the end, you arrive at some understanding of the ""craziness""-the foibles, misperceptions, and obsessions--which drive both your neighbor and yourself."
3,ok - not what I expected,"I probably should have checked this out in the library instead. Most of the poems have a narrative view first, then it shows the poem. I thought the poems would be more romantic, sympathetic for women, but it turns out that it shows the authors main life instead of a love poem written from the heart."
2,not what i expected,Some of the letters I have to question why they were included. $5.99 would be a better price for this. Extremely disappointed.
2,"Fine, but overrated","This is not the book from Sex and the City. The letters are not the same. It's not bad, but is mostly just letters from women and 19th century poets no one has ever heard of. If you buy this thinking it's really love letters from great men, as portrayed in the movie, you'll be disappointed."
1,NOT at all what I expected...or wanted,"I bought this book because I am getting married and wanted to find a romantic, moving reading for the ceremony. And, of course, like many other women who saw the Sex and the City Movie, fell in love with the poetry Mr. Big ""uses."" This book is not at all what I hoped for or wanted. I must admit that maybe my expectations were not realistic...as I think I was expecting to find stuff right out of the movie (ain't gonna happen). Yes, the letters are full of love...but are often quite depressing as well. If you like history and such...the history of old love is defined by separation for months, etc. That is documented here. I guess for my purposes...it missed the mark. Out of the entire book, I found one segment I truly liked and will most likely use. However, I think I could have come up with something else and saved my money."
5,Great!,"Loved all the various letters. Definitely well worth the price. I bought this on my Kindle, but only because I have no more room for 'real' books."
1,"Avoid, seriously avoid","I got this for Christmas, and yes, it lights up. So if you want it as a decoration, fine, but don't expect to actually USE it. The keys stick terribly, it is difficult and frustrating to operate, and after several months I dug out an old keyboard and switched back to it instead. I don't usually diss products, but I have rarely been so dissatisfied with a product."
3,Yep it lights up alright!,"This is a neat little keyboard, but it isn't anywhere near worth 33 bucks! It is completely flat and the keys are jammed next to each other.. reminds me of a laptop keyboard.Got this for my son cus he is always sitting in the dark on his computer.Warning.. the software is on FLOPPY disk, and he has no floppy disc drive.. A lot of newer computers don't. Tried to copy it to CD from my computer but for whatever reason my computer isn't showing my floppy drive..LOL..Figures.. Keyboard still works without software though.I think it is worth getting, but you could get a better price I think from ebay, just watch the shipping. I noticed when I looked on ebay the keyboard was cheap but shipping was inflated terribly!!"
3,illuminated keyboard,"its light really is terrific, however, it is SO small that it makes typing difficult. I want a full-sized one......hopefully I can find one made! It works, my son will like it---but for someone who types all the time--it might prove to small as it did with me....the lighting is what I wanted.but in a ""real-size"" keyboard!"
2,Spend a few more extra dollars.,"I bought this keyboard about 6 months ago. I thought it was great. Being able to type with the lights out not disturbing the wife. But after normal everyday use,e-mailing,surfing the web, I noticed that the letters are rubbing off on the keys. Soon there will be nothoing left of the N or the E on this keyboard. Spend a few extra dollars and get the better lighted keyboard. I will be replacing mine shortly."
1,Terrible Keyboard,"This was the worse keyboard I ever owned, the ""blue light"" on it was ""white"" and it was very dim. I actually returned one and got a replacement and it was just as bad. Trying to type on that keyboard was horrible. The keys were all jumbled together and just ""not"" a keyboard that anyone would type on. I hate the keyboard and I wasted my money."
4,Lighted keyboard,I just needed a simple keyboard to replace my original that failed with one that was lighted so I could see it better in my dark computer room. The ILLUMINATED MULTIMEDIA KEYBOARD BLUE ELECTRO-LUMINESCENT PS/2 ( EL-9805PB ) met these needs.
3,Photo illuminates keys too much,The photo for this keyboard shows an intense blue. Not even close. Poor quality as well.
3,Good for a Start but will want to upgrade later,"The lighting for the keys on the keyboard? Great. The size of the keyboard and placement of the keys? Disappointing. I didn't realize from the description that the additional keys were placed in different locations than a standard keyboard. DEL is in the bottom row to the right. Also, the shortcut buttons at the top of the keyboard are not illuminated at all so each time I try to adjust/mute the volume on my computer using the keyboard I'm feeling around in the dark and end up putting my computer to sleep half the time. It's good if you want a cheap illuminated keyboard but if you want a keyboard where you can utilize all the functionality, I suggest you spend a little more for a different one."
5,Wrong thing,"Guess I was rushing when I ordered this keyboard. Delivery was good but I thought that I had ordered a rubber keyboard. Did not go back to the original order but I am sure it will have been my fault. I will use this some time in the future, it looks interesting."
3,Lighted keyboard,"Keyboard is smaller than I expected. The keys do light up as described. It is a decent value for the money, but i would have ordered the upgraded version where the light is coming thru the actual keys themselves."
1,Does not light up,"Bought as a Christmas present, paid NDA freight, The keyboard for typing is fine however it does not light up, not worth the freight to ship back to vendor. The main reason I bought was for the light. Very disappointed."
1,"Tiny, tiny scale maps!",This is supposed to be an atlas but the maps are unreadable. The print is far too small. I got a headache trying to make sense of it. If you want maps that you can read then don't buy this book.
1,Use google instead!,"If i wanted a historical map atlas, i would have bought one. Take the word atlas off this book. What a waste, unless you are a foamer."
3,"If you need one, your really need one...","I have no idea why Porter-Cable doesn't include one of these with the their 75xx series routers. I admit that the big routers would overpower most really delicate bits, but there are too many bits that are almost impossible to find in 1/2"" size. Since my 7518 is the router in my router table, this collet is an absolute requirement.Enough complaining. The good news is that the 1/4"" collet is inexpensive and easily available. It works perfectly, of course, and is as solidly built as you would expect from a Porter-Cable professional tool. It also fits the 6xx series routers, in case you misplace one. So if you are like me and have four routers, you need one for backup in any case"
1,Big Rip-off,"I think it's criminal that Porter Cable has chosen not to include both the 1/4 inch and the 1/2 inch collet with this $300 plus router. This collet can't cost more than fifty cents; yet it's retailing for around $12. This is especially true since Porter Cable has joined the ranks of other companies, manufactoring their blades and bits in China. I have a number of Porter Cable tools, and they've always been first rate. I was really surprised when I received my new 7518, and it only had one collet. If they're going to rip you off on a collet, who knows what corners they're going to cut inside the case."
5,The Best video ever.,"I love thus video, and so does my toddler.LOVES IT. Has started quoting some of the poems...What a beautiful thing to fill your child's head with. Think about it.I would give it 10 stars if I could!"
3,Not What I Expected.,This DVD is great for kids who want to know what poetry is. The poems cover a wide range of styles and the kids commentaries are nice.
5,Educational and Tender,"My son is two-years-old and he is not permitted to watch television. (I am a psychologist and have done research as to the correlation of ADHD and television viewing). However, I discovered The Poetry Show on HBO and recorded it for my son. He absolutely loves it. He is now able to completely recite the Owl and the Pussycat and will recite some limited Shakespeare. The children interviewed in this DVD are so sweet and cerebral. It truly inspires a parent to introduce their children to the arts at a young age. This DVD has quality animations, wonderful celebrity readings of classic poems and is an overall well-done piece. I would recommend this to anyone. I believe it spans children of all ages and captures the attention and interest of adults alike."
2,"""No, No, No!""","My review title is a direct quote from my two-year old.She loved the Classical Baby series so I just bought the Poetry edition without reading the reviews. Everyone in our house enjoyed the first three DVDs so much that we gave sets away as baby gifts.The animation and choice of material in the latest edition is lovely but my daughter absolutely HATED the segments showing children talking about poetry. For that reason, the DVD really got really annoying really quickly.I think if they'd stuck to the original format without inserting the kids, it would've been more enjoyable.Maybe we'll have better luck next time."
5,Great Show for Little Ones,This video includes a good selection of poems read and illustrated in interesting ways. Some of the poems are very beautifully done. Great introduction to poetry.
3,It is ok,"it is ok, not as good as other ones.But it is new, my kid still like to watch it every so often."
1,already obsolete,"This book is rambling, incoherent, repetitive, intellectually dishonest and manipulative. It presents a extreme, one-sided interpretation of the 1989 NCTM math standards as universally recognized, research-based ""best practice.""I would recommend that anyone choosing texts for a math methods course use the 2000 NCTM standards themselves and, if necessary, a generic teaching methods text.The 2000 Standards document is economical, beautifully done and, most importantly, far closer to a consensus of teachers, teacher educators, mathematicians and psychologists on what constitutes best practice than the 1989 document which inspires this text."
2,"""remixed"" is important","The ""remixing"" on this CD is not a minor tweak, but active changes the colors of the tracks. I have both the original ""Musical Massage"" CDs and this one contains tracks that are more like re-recordings of the tracks on the originals. The melodies are recognizable, but the overall balance of instruments has been changed, and in some cases the addition of cheesy new synth strings has occured. The tracks are still beautiful compositions, but they just don't sound like David Darling to me - more like some new-age compilation DJ's reinterpretation of what DD should sound like. Get the originals and luxuriate in some wonderful music."
1,Ten Bucks is Too Much to Pay for a Pair of Bikini Briefs,Prospective buyers beware!I thought I was going to get a package of several pairs of bikini panties.All I got was one lousy pair.
2,Old School,This book is so outdated and basic. The pictures & examples are quite rudimentary. For a better value check out The Flash Animator.
5,Best Yet!,"Lisa Gardner just keeps getting better and better. I'd give this one 10 stars if I could. The book gives great insight into just how demoralizing rape can be for women, and how much more educating we need to do about this crime. The book is also a cliff-hanger, cleverly plotted and beautifully written. Great job."
5,Super Awesome Book!!!!,"I loved this book!! It was action packed from the very beginning and kept me guessing until the very end. Griffin was a perfect hero, and Jillian a perfect heroine!!!If you like suspense and romance, this book is for you. READ THIS BOOK!!!"
3,"Tired of being let down by formulaic, implausible endings","Started this novel and thought the writing, the characters, were wonderful. It was very spicey, very entertaining, and had me turning the pages. But as it neared the end and the typical thriller-formulaic-ending cliches started pouring down, I became very peeved. I am so sick and tired of the same old same old in these books. I guess the word is CONTRIVED. When writing becomes contrived, the art of writing goes out the window. The author, you realize, thought up the ending first, then fitted the story into it. How dull, dull, dull. So dull, this book lands with a thud. Do yourself a favor: don't set yourself up for disappointment."
3,some flaws,"I love a good detective story and this one was a nice puzzle. However, what irritated me was the chapter where the police were supposed to examine a prisoner's clothes and they missed the lockpick and Alka Seltzer sewn in the hem. Do we have to believe they're that stupid and incompetent?"
5,Five Stars,"The Dark Shape creeping through their bedroom; every woman's nightmare. And Lisa Gardner knows this. She has penned a great book about insidous rape. The Survivors Club is about three survivors of a serial rapist, who form a club to help them learn to live with the nightmare and to ensure it doesn't find its way to the ""dead case"" files. The book is so wonderfully written, the reader may find themselves peering over the top of the book to make sure the Dark Shape hasn't creeped in when they weren't looking! As I read it, I wondered if men would find the book as disturding as women; they don't live with the perpetual fear of rape. But the author's ability to paint the horror so realistically makes it disturbing and frightening for any reader, whether they are a man or woman.If you wish to read a great, suspenseful book The Survivors Club is for you."
5,"Engaging, scary, super.","This is actually the first Lisa Gardner book I've ever read, and I was not disappointed. I base the books I read largely on the reviews posted here, and they have yet to steer me wrong.There wasn't a thing I disliked about this book. I had it pretty much figured out from the beginning, but that did nothing to detract from the enjoyability.I couldn't put it down. READ IT."
3,pretty good,"This was my first Lisa Gardner book, and I'll try to read more of her novels. ""The Survivor's Club"" didn't really do it for me. I thought there were some huge plot gaps that made it hard to swallow. It's ridiculous to think that the police would let a convicted PEDOPHILE meet with a FIVE YEAR OLD GIRL under any circumstances. And I don't believe that the police would retreive an outfit of his choosing from some storage unit, especially when the police know that the guy is conspiring with someone on the outside. The police would just buy the criminal new clothes. Keeping these drawbacks in mind, I gave it three stars because it moved along as a plot, and did keep me reading til the end. Like I said, I'll try some more of her offerings, but if you want a well-written mystery, try the Harry Bosch books by Michael Connelly."
5,LOVE!! Lisa Gardner!! I'm Hooked!!,well I've read 7 L.Gardner's Novels and I haven't been disappointed yet!! now I'm going to read her FBI Profiler Series next.and See if there as good as the D.D.Warren Series.
5,Hard to put down!,"This was only the second of Lisa Gardner's books that I have read, and I will definintely be looking for more. I read into the wee hours of the night. It was simply terrific!"
3,NOT UP TO HER USUAL STANDARDS.,"I have read all of Lisa Gardner's books up to this point and have seen her consistently improve with each subsequent book. I was, however, left with a sense of disappointment after reading the Survivor's Club. I found myself putting it down frequently and not being tempted to pick it up again.The story itself was reasonably good, although the ending was anticlimactic. This was also the case in this author's first two books although she improved on this dramatically by book three. My real issue with this book is the graphic nature of one of the rape scenes. There were also the flashbacks of the survivors. If you, like me, have problems reading graphic rape, then this is not the book for you."
4,Lisa Gardner- what more can I say?,"Lisa Garner is the top mystery writer, in my opinion. While the plot captures the imagination, I felt that the continual use of the mentioning of rape a bit tiring after a while. I realize that it is a highly traumatic experience for any woman, but dwelling on it was somewhat tedious in my opinion. Otherwise, a great read from cover to cover. Recommended read for any myster buff!"
3,A very different sound.,"This is the first incarnation of Deep Purple. The song that most people are familiar with is ""Hush"" and it is the best song on the album. ""And The Address"" is a scorching instrumental. ""Love Help Me"" has a nice guitar solo and is a good pop song. If you're looking for the headbanging sound of Deep Purple, this isn't it. But it's still not that bad."
2,Vanilla Fudge clones,"Deep Purple started out in early '68 as Vanilla Fudge clones. John Lord caught the Fudge in fall '67 when they played London and were one of the hottest bands around. Ritchie Blackmore was more into Hendrix after making a living as a session player and in bands like Jerry Lee Lewis' back-up band. When Lord and Blackmore came together in early '68 they agreed they wanted to become a British Vanilla Fudge with Hendrix overtones. This is what they came up with......""Hush"" and ""Hey Joe"" are the best tracks here. They were still finding their direction, and only became ""heavier"" when Zeppelin's first album came out in '69. For a start, not a bad album......but nothing like what they would become later."
2,Deep Purple's First Album,"This isn't very good and it's not the Deep Purple that came out with...In Rock.There's maybe three somewhat decent songs and the rest are a boreing overload.The singer sounds dated and so do the band.I'd say Hush, Help and Hey Joe are the best tracks.And either one did the band write.However if your a big Deep Purple fan and want all there stuff.Buy this one because it's got the bonus tracks.Which are basically OK.DON'T PAY MUCH! BECAUSE THE BAND AND ALBUM SOUNDS LIKE THERE STUCK IN 1968.SOME RECORDS ALWAYS SEEM FRESH...NOT THIS ONE."
3,but not with the 1st line up!,"This band is the prettiest hard rock band of the world, but I don't like the 1st DP line up with Rod Evans on mic stand. This 1st Lp was not bad, but the sound reminded me of the rock sixties like Beatles. Rod Evans's singing style was copied from Lennon-Mc cartney too much from the 60's. Most serious of all that his singing style was not really exact for the heaviness band such as Deep PURPLE. Rod Evans had been fired in 1969, the other three founders of the band like Blackmore, lord and paice realized that he could not have any of capability to be a strong aggressive voice on the mic stand. ROD EVANS had been finally replaced by IAN GILLAN in 1969 (former episode six) and with Ian Gillan on mic stand on 1969 ( see CONCERTO FOR GROUP & ORCHESTRA) Deep Purple started their roots into the glorry road of Heaviness. Buy the next PURPLE albums with Gillan on mic stand.....please!"
1,"""Shades of Boredom"" is more like it","I bought this album out of a bargain bin a few years ago thinking it would be good, but it was definately NOT worth the $5.99 I payed for it! There is only one song on here that is even remotely listenable, and that's Hush. The rest of the album is dull, dull, dull. So boring it would make the bowling tournaments on TSN look like brilliant entertainment. I'm a big Deep Purple fan, but not of the Mark I albums. In fact, I'd even say I HATE that lineup. Deep Purple might have done great things later on, but that psychadelic pop they did in the 60s was truely awful! An embarrasment to Deep Purple's musical legacy."
5,Deep Purple At Their Best!,"Deep Purple is one of the mainstays of hard rock. This album has always been one of my favorites; of course Hush is one of the best songs of all time. The rest of the songs are great, too. The instrumentals as well as the singing is fantastic. Now, for the best news: this cd has been remastered! The sound is excellent. Get ready for some unbelievable listening pleasure. Buy this cd without hesitation."
4,What a good album!!!,First off most of the songs on this cd i gave a 4/5 but Hush on the other hand is a song that wont leave your cd player. Get this CD!!!!!! or die trying to.
4,Ahhhh the designs-- the portraits!,"I first found this book in a hotel library and thought about ""borrowing"" it! This artist's work is iconic and so far ahead of his time.I had to have it for myself and am so glad to own a copy via AMAZON.The stories about Klimt's women in his life helped shape him as an artist and allows us to understand him more.A beautiful glossy coffee table book that has substance."
4,Song Of The Golden Lotus.,I highly recommend it. Very soothing and ethereal. One of my favorites CD's. Perfect for meditation or love-making. You will not be disappointed.
2,disappointed,Teen tarot is not even worth shipping. The book contains very little practical information. this book contains no card reversals information. My advice is to not waste your money.
1,Not for the do it yourself person,This book is great for someone who needs ideas for decorating items. I was looking for a book which had templates for making different bags and boxes.
3,"Interesting book, outrageous price","This book is interesting, and full of thought provoking writing. However, I am still amazed at the price they are charging for a book that is only 120 some-odd pages long. Overall I had to give it an ""okay"" rating."
2,Skate soakers,"These soakers are not high quality. I've used them for three weeks, and they're already starting to wear a hole in them. If you skate a lot, I would look for some with a nylon strip on the bottom."
5,excellent,I bought this for my new scates and they fitted perfectly for a size 10 figure skates. I loved it
3,Was at this show,"This was 8/4/98, if I remember. I have the ticket stub somewhere. No mention of any recording was made. The crowd sang along to every verse, and was quite loud. For some reason, that was cut out of the record. Benton's vocals at the actual performance were louder and clearer, don't know why they seem muddied on the cd. He didn't really talk at all, just hammered out one song after another. They left off a few songs from Serpents, they played the whole album. I should have my original review from 98 around somewhere. It's a decent live disc, and the guitars have a real cool tone, it's just disappointing compared to what I saw and heard at the actual show."
4,Damn Good !,"Hey Guys,A Deicide Live album - who would've guessed ! But considering I grew up with my Slayer 'Decade of Aggression - Live' tapes wearing out my walkman batteries I was quite interested in it and picked it up recently. Basically the thing that hit me is the fact that these guys can play these songs live, and so well !! 'Musicianship' is the word that everyone uses and I can't think of a better one(!), its just amazing that they can maintain that energy and power. Benton's vocals come across well enough, and depending on personal tastes, you can tweak your sound system if you like to hear it different - In terms of a comparison - the Slayer live album is quite similar in mode and delivery. One thing that would've been cool would be hearing some crowd interaction, but we don't hear much from Benton except for song introductions...no big deal though. The only thing left on the Deicide wish list is a DVD"
1,Not good...,"Deicide are not a musically talented band to begin with so the lack of production and quality on this album does not help them. Redundant boring songs, all sounding the same over and over with bad quality sound......waste of cash!"
2,This must be a joke.,"The world is a good place, ahh yes another DEICIDE album. But wait, something's different, this album SUCKS! Someone please tell me why Deicide decided to put out a live album. Benton's volcals were awful. The only reason I gave this album two stars is the bands playing. The music was as intense as it gets, but the record is pointless. Buy the studio albums, they're all great. Let's just hope Deicide doesn't do this again."
5,Perfect portable Speaker System,"I love it! I bought it to use on my motorcyle. I take it with me to work and have had many compliments on it. Excellent sound and volume. I do not understand why when i bought it some of the reveiws said it was not loud enough, WOW, it has lots of volume. If i did not think it had enough volume, i would have not bought it to use on my motorcyle.Again I love it!Thank You"
3,"compact, portable, good sound","i really like the size and shape of this unit, and the carrying case that comes with it is very handy. the output/sound is nice, although there have been a few songs that i have noticed the speakers cracking a bit,and not at full volume, either. My biggest peeve with this unit is that there is no ""memory"" per se, on the volume. i.e. when you turn the unit off at a certain volume, then turn it back on again, there is a big discrepancy,and its not where you left it, so i am constantly pushing the volume down button , rapid fire, to get it back to the previous level. also, adjusting the volume on your ipod has no effect on the volume/output in the unit. i prefer to be able to adjust both, just as i can in my vehicle with my car stero volume and ipod volume. all in all, its a good buy."
3,Odd pop,"I too have experienced the same loud pop that another reviewer claimed to have heard. I also took the first unit back to Fry's Electronics and swapped for another. It too does the same thing but I noticed it only does it when running on battery function - that makes portability not as easily obtainable. I love the looks, feel and the sound of the machine otherwise. I plan to write the mfg and ask about the pop. If it cannot be remedied I will return this unit and look for something else."
2,"Great design, Poor performance.","I purchased this for work and home yesterday and will be returning it promptly.Pros: Great design. Simple and organanized buttons and functions. Very portable and rugged. Feels well built.Cons: Aparantly due to the transformer type they decided to build it with as another reviewer stated, there is defintely a very audible hiss at any volume level with or without a signal.In summary, I love the product design and though I really wanted to believe this would perform as good as other lansing products, it plainly fails compared to my older original inmotion speaker when placed side by side.I'd only buy this if it were $30 new for trips to the beach, but even at work (construction) I want a better sound."
1,NOT compatible with NEW iPod nano,"I bought the IM9 together with a 8Gb iPod nano on 11/2/06, only to discover that the adapter provided with the IM9 is NOT compatible with this iPod (despite a specific statement on the box that this system would be compatible with the nano). Customer Service said ""yeah, that's a problem with the ""new"" nano, we should have a new adapter available on our web site (for a $3 shipping charge) in about 2 weeks"".Otherwise the system is great, but if you own a ""new"" nano, you're out of luck :("
1,No adapter for new Nano 3rd Gen,"Although on the front of the IM9 box it indicates that you can request a new Nano adapter from Altec Lansing, that's basically the end of the story. First, I tried to go to the website given on the box as the way to order the adapter. That website does not exist.After registering with the company so that I could email a request for an adapter for the new Nano, both of my emails were ignored and then deleted (even though they did give me a Reference Number for each of my questions). Then I called Customer Service and was told that there is not an adapter and there will not be one.Bottom line: Yes, you can request an adapter for the IM9 for the new Nano, either in writing or via the phone, but the answer is, ""no"""
1,Doesn't Fit 2nd Gen. Nano,"Despite that Altec Lansing promotes that the IM9 is compatible with iPod Nano; be advised that it does NOT fit the 2nd generation Nano model (with the aluminum case). This misleading information left me wishing I could have given the product a zero rating because the omission made the product unfit for it's intended and advertised purpose for me. It might be a great product but I was unable to judge it's performance because I don't own an iPod the IM9 would accommodate. If like me, you have a 2nd gen. Nano, you're out of luck. I'm surprised to find only one review that mentions this incompatibility. I returned the IM9 to Amazon for credit."
1,Worst Customer Service Ever,"I purchased an InMotion 9 speaker in December. It came with an AC wall outlet plug not for the USA, but one for Asia. Afer a very long hold 27 minute period in the queue on January 3, I was helped and told that I would receive a new outlet plug within 5-6 business days.LONG STORY SHORT, IT IS MARCH 18, 2008 AND I STILL DO NOT HAVE THE PLUG. Every time I call (and it's every 7-10 days), the plugs are due in tomorrow, next week or ""it's in the mail to you."" Today I spoke to a new manager and he will FedEx me a plug tonight because ""they are always in stock."" I would like to believe him, and am hopeful...I will NOT but any product from Altec Lansing again after being treated like this. This is pathetic."
2,altec speaker dock for ipod,I received promptly. I felt the instructions were not very good (the problem may be me!). Also my ipod when it's inserted does not center up with the opening. Not particularly happy with what should be a simple procedure. The sound reproduction is fine.
4,good sounds,"like the speakers, I wish it had a way to control the bass, treble, ect. Other than that i love the loud sound they provide. Thank you."
5,its not a sub woofer& it rockz all the way,"its a so cool, will be useing it at drive ins ,it is not and can not be a sub, as some wood like it to be,and it dos not need one! it has a lot of bass ! big time to, i pay $ 50.00 at target new !its sells for a lot more all over! i/we do not have a ipod ,we have all mini-disc,minidisc,md,I.E. sony i use it for thim you can use your ipod (pre/eq/out,) if ipod,s has one but this thing dos not have one ,it dos not need one!if you need a sub get one all i /we see is all ipod stuff all over the net you can not clilk and not see ipod this ipod that!get a mini-disc you do not pay for it to work like ipods not that ipods ore bad but you need lots of $$$ 2 go thar, not whith md/mini-disc/minidisc/and now all you can get in us is a sony md"
5,best sound for the price,I bought these speakers when they were first released years back because of the great sound quality and how loud they got. I have not had any problems and they get heavy use in my backyard or BBQs. My brother was so impressed with them he bought two. For 49.99 I think they are the best portable speakers out there for the price.
2,Doesn' twork well for 5th Generation Nano,"The iPod 5th Generation Nano does not fit well into this machine. The Speaker comes with a canvas carrying case, but the case is really too small for the speaker. It is a really really tight fit. I can't say much about sound quality, since I returned this product."
4,slightly frustrated,The sound quality is great portability up to expectations my problem is the pastic insert to hold my nano 2 in place when clicked in place will not line up the nano so it can plug into the connection device..as yet this problem is unresolved
4,Altec Lansing Im9 In Motion Mobile Audio,"Great Product but I wish it had a remote. Sound, price, and size are great."
5,Blown Away,"I didn't buy this on amazon, however, i do own it and i can tell you that this is an amazing product. I used to own many portable speakers and they all sucked compared to this, what used to be low 3 watt speakers get drowned out in the loud clear bass of the iM9, perfect for trips to the beach or to go camping. I Highly recommend."
4,"Great Sound, But...","Great sound, sharp look and simple controls. My only gripe is that it doesn't have a remote control. One feature that I really didn't expect was the video output that lets you play your video Ipod directly onto your TV."
4,"Decent Sound, Awesome Portability","The sound quality on this Ipod player is decent. The bass is a little flat but it's hard to expect more from something so small. The portability is great. Plugs into the wall to charge, uses C batteries when you can't plug in. Ruggedly built. Seems like it can hold up to some abuse.Overall, for the price it's not bad. I'm happy with it."
4,Great Sound,"I have two friends who already had this product and I just had to have it. We use it for music on the golf course. Great way to relax while playing golf. The sound is unbelievable, the unit is easy to set up and easy to transport. There are two draw backs. I wish it came with a remote control. I have a newer nano and it does not fit well in the dock. If I put it in the converter dock then I cannot use the play button on my nano. Bad design in that sense. If you want a great sounding unit though, this is it."
4,Great sound but a little heavy.,This product puts out great soud for its size but it's a little heavy for travel (5 pounds). But I'll still take it along because the quality of the sound makes it worth it.
4,How to get to know God for those who do not believe,"This book is by religion columnist Louis Cassels. This religion columnist analyses arguments for and against God's existence in a book intended for wistful agnostics and reluctant atheists. Attributes the roots of skepticism to science, secularism, cultural conditioning, and the failing credibility of religious institutions. Asserts that direct personal experience can verify the reality of God.Educated people of our time are taught to be skeptical of God. He is there and not hard to find. All you need to do is look. Just because you do not believe in God, does not mean He is not there. You cannot see the sun at all times, yet you know it is there. Not everything can be verified by science...not even science."
3,The first play based on recent history.,"This is generally not considered one of the better plays of Aeschylus; yet, I did enjoy it, even though there is very little action. Perhaps it is because it dealt with a subject of contemporary interest to its original audience. In fact, it is the oldest surviving play based on an event of recent history. The play was first produced in 472 B. C., only eight years after the Battle of Salamis. The speech by the Messenger in the play is the earliest known historical account of that battle. The play takes place in the Persian court and simply presents the arrival of a messenger carrying the news of Persia's defeat and is followed by the entry of a disgraced Xerxes. This play also contains the earliest known appearance by a ghost in a drama."
2,Not as advertised.,"Do not believe the book description! Frankly, I find it very misleading. This book is NOT a sequel to ""With your own two hands"". It is the personal memoirs of Mr. Bernstein, and poor ones at that. After reading nearly 100 pages, I could not tell why Mr. Bernstein even wrote the book. Mr. Bernstein relates an incident where a well-known writer implies that Mr. Bernstein has not done enough to write his memoirs. I'm afraid that Mr. Bernstein should have followed his friend's advice."
5,even in silence these places speak,"the isolation of these locations makes the pictures found within the pages of this book possible; and the talent of both photographers is outstanding. They have captured images that are both haunting and at times sad of the lives that once inhabited these locations but are now only shadows and whispers. They tell of how early towns were set up along the railroad lines and what was done to attract people to live there, and how these small towns survive today. They visit many locations from previous years to find things unchanged execpt for additional layers of dust, or that one of the old cars has been moved or sold to a collector.Sometimes the locations have collapsed under winter snows, they document this event as well. This is a good book and well worth having in any collection."
5,Ghosts In The Wilderness,"Absolutely BRILLIANT ! ! The Worobiecs have done an OUTSTANDING job 'telling' this story through the lens . So many of the images in this book not only tell the story but strike an emotional chord at the same time . My grandparents made a pretty decent living in the 1950s working a small farm in Texas . 60 years later , that small farm wouldn't produce enough profit to fuel a tractor for a season much less provide a decent living for the owners . This book tells the same story as the pictures inside leave you wondering whose grandparents worked this land and raised their families on it , only to abandon it at a later time because they couldn't make it work . Bitter-sweet to say the least ."
5,The Best,"The best everyday, all around tea. Great balance, body, color, taste and versatility. Hot, cold, milk, no milk, sugar, lemon...however you like it it makes the best cup of tea hands down."
1,NOT a cabin air filter for a Jeep,I ordered this Wix 46134 Air Filter Panel for a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The description says that it is a cabin air filter for that vehicle... It is NOT.
2,Not to sure about this product,"Unless it is user error, I really don't feel that this product does anything. I tried it several times and did not see a difference in the weed control. I really feel that pulling the weeds out by the root or using a spray when they get out of control is the BEST way to go."
4,Two Routers in One,"This is a really nice package, you get a fixed base and plunge router all in one. The motor screws out easy and drops in the other.I use this router in a router table and with a PC dovetail jig. It is such a standard that you can get predrilled router table inserts made for this router.Switching between 1/4"" and 1/2"" collets is simple. You can switch back and forth without a concern.The only thing I don't like is the toggle on-off switch when using it in my hands. That's fine for the router table, but I prefer a finger trigger switch for handheld use."
3,A good tool value.,"The versatility of this router is hard to beat. I leave the standard base fastened to my router table and use the plunge base for free hand work. The motor has power to spare and both bases are easy to adjust and use. My only serious criticism is that releasing the clamping mechanism on the plunge base is rather difficult. Keeping track of the wrench, screw, washer and nut while tapping the clamp free can be quite challenging if you work on a busy job site. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a professional quality tool but has a limited budget."
3,More Power Needed,"I bought this Router and it worked just fine, until I had to do some real work. It lasted about 3 weeks.I was routing a 1/2 inch wide by 3/4 deep rabit on a piece of red oak, using the router in a table. I had four bords to rout. I was almost done with the second board when the router started to make rude noises. A few seconds later, it just quit, leaving large amounts of ozone tainted air and a very frustrated user.It turned out that both brushes were gone, totally burned away. One of the brush contacts on the spindle was entirely fused off. The router is now scrap.I would buy, and am now, a router with more horsepower if you intend anythin else but occasional weekend work. Do not expect this router to last under anything other than ossasional use."
2,Very Shabby !!,I think the author is technically good but very shabby & lazy! .. as usual with developers (including me). Thats why developers dont make good authors.The example in this book is fully messed up. This book has absolutely NOT been reviewed/edited. Looks like the print is a draft version. The authors (multiple of them) never cared to even read their own book.
4,"Very good, needs more on WebFlow","I had been developing within Spring MVC for about half a year before I purchased this book. The section on testing Spring MVC was a little sparse, and the authors should have introduced more examples on WebFlow. Otherwise, I think it's a great book with lots of applicable examples.(One of my co-workers took this book home over the weekend, read this book and got completely up to speed on Spring MVC. He was very impressed with it.)"
1,Great fiction,"As computer books continue their never ending slide into the abyss, Apress and Manning seem to be leading the way. This book is one of the best works of fiction ever written. From incomplete and non-working examples to the many errors, the publishers would be better served by pulling this tome off the market and starting over. There is nothing ""expert"" in this text nor is there anything the least bit helpful. Well, ok, I will admit the UML diagrams are nice.Avoid this book at all costs."
1,Unorganized and incomplete,I had trouble getting what I needed out of this book. It was a little unorganized and fragmented.I suggest Spring Recipes.
4,Pretty good cover!,"I like this cover as it fits snuggly to my camera and doesn't obscure the view window, the lens, or the flash. Manipulating the settings on the camera is easy enough unless you don't have the buttons memorized. Due to the material that the case is made out of it makes it difficult to get in and out of my pants pockets and it tends to collect dirt and dust. Overall, it is a good product and it protects my camera nicely."
1,Not worth it!,"First of all, this product is NOT worth the $15. I had it for only a few months and it ripped (even though I was gentle with it). Also, it doesn't have a clear screen cover. In my opinion, that's the most important thing to be protected!! I only bought it because I couldnt find ANY comment about if there was a screen cover, and there isn't. And last...you have to take the cover off completely to access the battery and memory card. It's just a total pain in the neck for $15...don't buy it."
2,Not a Nikon Product,"This is NOT a Nikon BM-5, and both the picture and the ""by Nikon"" attribution are FALSE. This is a cheap knock-off made of inferior plastic, and the ""clear"" area through which you view the LCD is warped and distorts the image. It does clip onto the my D70s, and I suppose it might be alright in a pinch if you bought it for two bucks on eBay, but if I had known this was not a real Nikon BM-5, there's no freaking way I would have paid ten bucks for this.This will be returns for refund as soon as possible, because the item delivered was not the one described."
1,horrible purchase,"I was so frustrated with this printer...I intentionally broke it to buy a better one. The print time is extremely slow, the quality horrible and the letters not in line. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Still as good as the day I bought it . . .,"It took nearly three months for me to print one page with this printer. Why? The printer I bought came with a faulty ink cartridge. I mailed it in and over a month later received another printer, with another faulty ink cartridge. A month later I actually received a working cartridge from the fine folks at Canon- at least they were nice- and finally I am able to use my printer. Sort of.Now instead of the six orange flashing lights, I'm getting four and three and sometimes they're green, and all the while this thing grunts and grinds and shakes back and forth like some wild-eyed shivering hog.It prints sideways, it grabs ten sheets at once, it won't grab the paper at all, and heaven forbid the black ink actually come out black instead red and green and blue.This printer has made me reexamine my faith. No benevolent being could unleash this beast upon the world. For your own well-being, please steer clear of this monstrosity."
3,It worked fine for about a year with little or no problems--,"then it started showing those ""orange"" lights indicating a paper jam. There isn't any!!! I have done everything possible to get it working correctly, including re-installing the drivers. Nothing works - all I get is the green and orange flashing lights. I'm ready to toss it. I was pleased with it at first because it was very economical and easy to use. I can't figure out what happened to it!!!!"
1,Same old...,"Gack. Same old BS. Yet another contribution(?) to the pie-in-the-sky-when-you-die myth.If the painfully obvious results of this silliness were not so sad, one might well marvel at that perverse human trait that not only allows for self-delusion but insists on spreading delusion to others. Crockery, purest crockery. Bless us, for we are idiots."
4,The Great Doctrine of the Bible,"This book has a lot of information for you putting the bible, for me inProspective giving me scripture to go by."
2,knock off copy,The book I received was not the book pictured. It was a poor quality copy. The back cover claimed it was a book about great literature including Shakespeare when it is a Bible book. I am using this book for college courses and am struggling because it is not laid out the same as the original and there are many typos.
4,Good Introduction to Theology,"This is a very good introduction to Christian Theology. It is basic and concise. Not as thorough a treatment as some might wish, but very well laid out and user friendly for developing your own lessons on the subjects it covers."
5,Great!,Awesome! We love have this good old book on our Kindle. it was also a book required for our child ar college & this was a great way for them to read it.
1,Stay Away,"I purhcased this unit recently, with the idea of downloading from TiVo and at the same time eliminating my VCR. What a huge disappointment. I haven't even tried to record discs yet. I played some of my very clean CDs, some of which were brand new, and noticed a few skips and freezes. When I watch rented DVDs, the system locks up all the time, and skips huge portions of the content. I'm in the process of trying to return it, or get it fixed. But, if I can't, I'm just going to bash it in with a sledge hammer."
2,Kid game the kids can't play,"I got this game for my kids. They love curious George. But, the game is way too difficult for them to play. I am a veteran gamer and it was rather frustrating and difficult for me to play myself.Long story short, I wouldn't recommend this title."
4,Track listing...,Tracks...1) Handouts2) Not Alone3) The Joker4) What's The Deal5) The Struggle6) Alright Then7) Lottery8) Regrets9) Back Up10) The Reason11) Mr. Walsh Blues12) That Reminds Me
4,Heavy duty,Nice router but if I had seen ANYWHERE that it was not made in the USA I would have looked harder for one that is.
4,Almost as good as having a shaper,"I have had this router for well over five years now and really put it through its paces. The power is incredible with even the largest of bits. You can take those long half-inch diameter upcut spiral bits and plunge inch-and-a-half deep mortises in solid oak in one pass if you are so inclinded. I don't always use it in a router table because I have only had one router in the past. It is on the heavy side for hand held uses, but the soft start keeps your firmly in control. The only thing lacking is a micro-adjustment for height. An indication of how great this particular model router was made is its longevity over the years as a hallmark Porter Cable product."
2,Watch Review by Frank Felty,"Crystal on the watch is way two thick making it hard to see unless you look directly down at it, so therefore, I sent it back for a refund."
1,unhappy with this product's price,I found a very similiar product on sale at a Marshall's type store for only $50 !! That's one hundred less than what is being sold on Amazon.
2,Slightly better than the first.,"I obtained Star's End and Galaxies End at the same time, otherwise I would have stopped after the first book. Galaxies End is a continuation of Star's End, almost like taking a whole book and cutting it. There are many interesting ideas, but the plot and character development were ridiculously weak. I continued on because of some very fascinating ideas, that unfortunately go nowhere. If you like topics to think about, pick up this book. If you are looking for a story with a plot, much less an end or even a stopping point, don't bother with this book."
1,Big build-up with no punchline,"As a piece of fiction, it showed lots of imagination and wonderful alien characterizations. However, the book was vague, sometimes confusing, made lots of promises...then delivers absolutely NO ENDING! What the heck? If anyone sees the author on the street, punch him in the nose for me.If there's a third volume to this finish the series, I haven't heard of it. Don't buy the book...don't even waste your time checking it out of the library"
4,Simply Divine,"For younger fans of Jessye, who have never had the opportunity to see/hear her live, this visual brings you a little closer to the magic that is Jessye Norman. Yes, it is a little contrived having Jessye lip-sync to her audio recordings and the camera get all orbital around her, but then again if all I wanted was to hear a recording, then I wouldn't buy the dvd then would I?The only thing that gripes me is that my copy of the dvd seems to have the audio track (for spoken interviews) seems to be out of sync with the visual. Rather like watching a dubbed movie. While it doesn't bother me so much when she is lip-syncing, it bothers me greatly during the interviews. If you're going to interview the great Jessye, than at least lay your master audio and video tracks so that they sync. Or is it just my copy?"
2,Jessye ill-served,"Here's the deal: this one-of-a-kind singer deserves better than this. And yet she was entirely complicit. The singing herein is all (except for an impromptu snippet that erupts during an interview) lip-synched. Not only that, but it's poorly, inaccuarately lip-synched. She's lipping some of my favorite stuff: one of Mahler's Kindertotenlieder, the Strauss piece from Four Last Songs which plays a role in the film, ""The Hours""; one of Alban Berg's songs. Most of the selections were recorded 20 years prior to this production. She's the sort of artist for whom each performance is unique, finding something new each time. So, of course, lip-synching is a skill antithetical to her art. Who's the fool that put her in this place!?"
4,"Quality of DVD fair to good, but interesting performances",How did they get so many big stars to be in this one TV movie? Liked it a lot. Maureen Stapleton and Mike Farrell are terrific... but it's Kelly McGillis that stands out. This was just after her great performance in WITNESS.
5,CONCISE AND COMFORTING FOR ENTREPRENEURS,"For anyone who has ever started a business, dreamed of starting one, or has just started down the rocky winding road of entrepreneurship (often armed only with faith, high hopes and dreams to face numerous challenges, issues, risks, questions and fears of failure) this book is a easy quick MUST READ!Ms. Dunung writes with concise insight, practical advice and information of the common experiences of all entrepreneurs, obviously drawn from the knowledge of her own life experiences.For me, this book will be on my office bookshelf for continuing reference and troubleshooting since each chapter not only addresses the basics of every conceivable issue I may face as a new business owner.In addition, Ms. Dunung's words are not only informative, but also supportive and inspirational, much like those of a mentor or coach, offering encouragement from someone who's been there!"
3,thirty six all time greatest hits,"A very tempting title.I'm a big fan of Glenn Yarbrough.I'd be more interested in buying this album,but it shows no song list.I never buy music that doesn't show a song list."
3,"Too much lecturing, not enough visuals",Michael Wood is an enthusiastic and articulate presenter but I found myself wanting more out of these videos than his constant presence. The photography is of historic sites is fine but I would have appreciated maps and other visual aids to enhance the presentation.
3,Beatifully designed but not in English,"Beautifully designed by Taschen, the book covers the major works by Meier from 1965 (Smith House) to the Getty Center (1997). Published in 1995, the later works (such as the Getty) are presented only in models or sketches. The text is not in English but Spanish, French, and Portuguese, so many U.S. readers may have find the book of limited value despite that it among the least expensive books about Meier's works."
5,Solo Virtuosity,"Mr. Brotzmann may have recorded more solo saxophone work than anyone else. Few players are up for these rigors of naked performance.Given his command of his reed instruments, Mr. Brotzmann is endlessly fascinating and surprising. He can blow gently and melodically; he can explode and blow up the room; he can make every imaginable (and some unimaginable) sounds on his instruments, but each has its place. There is a method and a meaning in his mania.One should listen to this work while doing nothing else. You will enter a world of wonder."
3,the CD contains good songs however he has had betters.,diomedes is a great artist that expresses his feelings through his songs therefore I consider that this Cd will show the folclor of his personality and region.
4,"Great band, great CD!!!","I've seen The Snap perform live several times and I finally picked up this CD. It's VERY good!A lot of bands don't sound as good on an album as they do live. This is not a problem for The Snap. This CD captures the great energy and fun that is fully evident when they perform live. If you've ever seen them, then you know it's almost impossible to not have fun while watching them. This CD is the same way. If you listen to it, then you're definitely going to enjoy it.Get Unsnapped!"
4,gangsta flick for the drum'n'bass massive,"Stylish low budget UK gangsta picture set in Manchester: drum'n'bass and ragga soundtrack with bass at realistic nightclub/car audio volumes (at least on the DVD version). Expect your subwoofer(s) to get a good workout, and things to fall off the walls. Maybe the boy-band-ish dance act is a little cheesy, but the violence and bass make up for it.While the sound on the DVD is excellent, the video is full-screen (4:3) only, and not very sharp. Some of the text in the credits is nearly illegible. See the forum for this movie at IMDB for a transcription of the soundtrack listing."
2,FIRE THE EDITOR!!,"I just may be the biggest Bowiephile ever. I heard about the film from a friend, who hated it. I bought the film on the strength of my interest in all things Bowie. Period. As I watched the first 20-30 minutes of the film, I just knew in my heart that it was going to get better. I guess the joke was on me that fateful day. Not only is the movie confusing of many levels, the story is far from original, none of the characters actually develop, and even the soundtrack is sub-par. In a nutshell: Two brothers are released from prison on the same day, then decide to return to a life of crime. That's it!! That's everything this movie has to offer. Bowie had a great opportunity to take his character of an aging English Ganster to some interesting places. Instead, he nonchalantly meanders through his lines without offering us anything more than a script reading. Also, whoever heard of a hardcore gangster who sews?!!? In short, I can't recommend this film even out of curiosity."
3,This movie grows on me with each viewing,I was so pumped to find a copy of this for $10. After the first viewing I was a bit dissapointed. It's a bizarre movie that I am enjoying more and more as I watch it. The music is phat and I have to find the soundtrack if there is one out there. I love Bowie and Goldie so this film fits right in my collection. Take it at face value and enjoy the beats.
5,AWESOME!,This video was extremely entertaining and it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. It proves you can't trust anyone... Not even your closest friend or family member.
3,A Memoir of all of us.,"This was not a very interesting book to read. However, the only pleasure that was derived from reading it was that he said what all of us Palestinians, and Arabs do not dare to say, or are not as eloquent as Said in saying them. He writes of my family; his childhood resembles most of the Palestinians of that time; his childhood resembles my father's. Again, he puts it more eloquently than any of us could."
4,Out of Place: A Memoir,The writer reveals several intimate details of his life. Too many for me. His story is a reminder that many of us do not always fit in in the milieu of which we are a part. So it is helpful to know that even if we do not fit in we can live a useful life.
5,Palestine land with people ...!!!,"Edward Said did it again for the sake of truth,justice and fairness for the Palestinian people ,whom he proudly belong to ,Edward Said broke many taboos and myths about the way Americans tend to veiw the Palestine -Israel conflict .Said clearly says to the west ...take off your sun-glasses so you can see the truth...for Edward Said I say great work ...you are the best America has to offer ,when it comes asking for advice about the bloody mid-east .."
5,mark latham,bangin.... i got it straight from fallen angel-speedy--better peep it..it will be wanted in future.M.L.
4,"Terse, but very useful, shop manual","As it says on the cover, this shop manual is written for the experienced mechanic. However, it is readable enough to be useful to guys like me who are just tinkering with their tractor. Excellent pictures and diagrams accompany the text."
3,Bright green bean bag chair,The chair is smaller than expected and not very squishy. I would recommend it only for a small child. Pretty color green.
5,HOT HOT HOT,"Having been set the task of setting up a successful business as part of their college course, a group of students take a surprising route by setting up their own escort agency!"
2,Disappointing for a popular brand,"I have had my 7529 for over a year and in balance, I am disappointed. When new, I had to go back to the retailer 3 times to find a unit that worked properly (plunge lock would not stay unlocked) and even it lacked several minor parts. Porter Cable responded to my first inquiry with a free replacement part (lock nut for the plunge lock), but has ignored subsequent requests for a part (bushing on plunge gauge). The screw that holds the plunge gauge won't stay tight. Now the power lock won't stay on and I have to use a clamp to keep it going. I cannot recommend this unit."
4,Good Router - Satisfied with Purchase,"This is the first plunge router I have owned and I like it. Good power and has a good feel. I especially like the placement of the power switch on the handle -- easy to use. Also has a ""lock on"" feature so you don't have to hold the switch down -- it will lock down while in use. I did find that there was noticable drag on the motor when the ""lock on"" feature was used. However, if I held down on the switch with my thumb, the drag didn't occur. Not sure what that's all about! Bits are very easy to change. The plastic dust shield won't stay on -- keeps falling off. I just took it off and tightened my safety glasses! I was disappointed that I missed seeing the model 7529K, which includes the template guide kit. I bought the router only -- the ""kit"" model is only $5.00 extra. All in all I'm satisified with this router. I am even considering the purchase of a model 7518 later this year for use in a router table that I plan to build. Happy woodworking!"
1,Not Satisfied with ToolKing,"Reconditioned tools should be functionally checked and cleaned prior to shipment to any customer.. The 7529 PC Plunge Router I received was neither clean nor functional when I received it.In all fairness to ToolKing.... they did refund my purchase price and the cost of shipment one way, but declined to absorb the cost of my shipping costs to them."
4,Good not great,"I've had this router for about a month now and have no real complaints about it. Some of the reviewers have complained about various things such as lack of power, broken switch, etc., but so far I've been suprisingly impressed with it. Granted, as a plunge router, I feel you could do better, but it is a good all around router. In particular it does well under a table. PC used some thought when designing were the variable speed control and the addition of a second power switch on the base was a nice touch. I might add that I picked this router up new for .... on a ""going out of business sale"". Had I not gotten such a good price I would have opted to purchasing the dewalt 2hp plunge. All in all, it's a good router, if you can get it on sale."
1,"A Big Disappointment, Now A Great Paperweight",".PROS.1. Liked the speed settings.2. When it ran, it ran very quietly, very low noise.3. Makes a great $214 paperweight, just be sure to dust it every so often, since it tends to gathers dust.Cons: l. Difficult to make height adjustments. 2. On/Off Switches make it difficult to turn on and off. Plunge mechanism slips and is awkward to use.Makes a great paperweight."
3,SHAME ON YOU PORTER CABLE,"I PURCHASED THIS ROUTER AT LOWES. AFTER 3 IGOT ONE I THOUGHT WAS RIGHT. BOY WAS I MISTAKEN. ON OFF HANDEL TRIGGER WOUNT STAY ON SIDE PLAY IN PLUNDGER- ACTION SQUICKY PLUNDGE ACTION ALL THE PROBLEMS EVERY ONE ELSE REPORTED.SO WY DID I BUY ONE WELL I THOUGHT PORTER CABLE WOULD HAVE TAKEN CARE OF THESE PROBLEMS BY THE TIME I BOUGHT ONE. MY TWO HP, CRAFTSMAN INDUSTERIAL ROUTER HAS TWICE THE POWER AS THE P.C. 7529.FOLKES SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THE P.C.7529 AND UPGRADE TO A 3.25 P.C. YOU WONT REGRET IT CHARLES A. WHALEY-"
2,Save your money,"I had this router for approximately one year when it suddenly burned out. It worked great for about that period of time, smooth, quiet and plenty of power. I was surprised, as the router had never been heavily taxed, either by cutting through very hard wood or by planting the bits deep in the cut. I also did not use it that much in the first year. The burnout also happened right in the middle of a project. An estimated repair cost was $... Since this is almost the cost of a new router and takes four weeks to fix, it was more practical to buy a new one. When I originally purchased this, users were raving about it. Caveat emptor."
1,PC-7529 is a loser,This is the worst tool that I have used from Porter Cable. I have tried to fix a depth and it would not stay where I wanted the depth of cut. This is really a problem when using your Leigh Dovetail Jig or a router table. There are two mistakes in the users manual that I told Porter Cable reps about a year ago and they are still there when I called them about two weeks ago.I only have one good thing to say about this router it is very quiet.
1,Not worth a cent,"I am a G.C.in Austin TX. area. I have used every router that has been in production since 1970, this thing has no power, can't cut quarter inch masonite without stoping. I change bits but same. I am returning for refund."
1,Junk-save your money,"I ordered this router by mail. Plunge is jerky. I used this thing to make a 14"" pie crust tea tray. I cut two 1/2"" circles with it and now it doesn't work. Never dropped or abused in any way. I barley used it enough to get it dusty. buy something else, this one is junk."
3,Cool covers,"Krokus is a hard rock band with distinct vocals hard edge guitars. The track, ""Screaming in the knight"", is, in my opinion, one of the best slow rock songs of all time. They put their mark on a few classic covers."
4,Good Collection...BUT!!!,"Yes,,,,I'm giving this 4 stars for most of its material...even though this anthology has all you would expect from a KROKUS catalog..it STILL...YET AGAIN!!!(AS ALL THEIR HITS PACKAGES DO),omits one of their most classic songs, ""WINNING MAN"". This song is what put Krokus on the radio in the U.S.,or at least in my hometown area of Cincinnati, Ohio. It also does not include ""OUR LOVE"", another radio hit here in the U.S. I feel it should include those songs.The songs ""WINNING MAN"" and ""BURNING BONES"" from the HARDWARE CD (1981), ""OUR LOVE"" from THE BLITZ CD (1984), & ""BYE BYE BABY"" from the PAY IT IN METAL CD (1978). this way you won't have to go buy those 3 CD's to get these songs on CD's that were manufactured before all the ""REMASTERING"" craze of today!!"
1,Bad experience.,"I bought 2 of these (model 3016) fans. I thought the 1st one was just a bad apple. However both of them had blades that were out of balance. This made them vibrate, and when you hung them on the wall the whole wall vibrated, loudly. This is poor workmanship and or quality control. I went with another brand."
2,Works but noisy. Cheap plastic.,It works but it may have a slightly bent shaft or something. (Damage during shipping?) The thing rattles and shakes when turned on. Does the job but I'm looking to replace it now... with another brand of fan.
2,NOT quiet!,I bought this fan to put in my daughter's bedroom! First of all it vibrates a lot and then when it oscillates there is a rattle! I guess it would be ok in any other room but not in a bedroom as it makes too much noise...
3,Whisper Quiet? NOT,"Purchased this for a bedroom that we can't use a regular ceiling fan in. As for the 'Whisper Quiet' feature listed in the description - I don't think so... Having tried several portable type fans, I've reached the conclusion that you're not going to find one that's as quiet as a ceiling fan. Also, this thing is WAY overpriced. $25 tops would be reasonable. Don't buy it thinking that the higher price indicates quality. Believe me it doesn't with this fan. The only redeeming feature is the wall-mounting capability which is usually found only on industrial type fans."
2,Wobbly blade. No help,"One of the two fans I ordered had a wobbly blade that kept rubbing and making a bad noise. When I called Lasko they basically said, ""Tough Luck. You can order another blade at your cost but there is nothing we can do."" After roughly only 30+ days of running them full time, mounted on the wall, they both vibrate and the blades seem to warp, even in a house with A/C. I would not recommend these to anyone. We had to chose wall mount fans as our ceilings have no electricity running to them. Good idea, but bad performance."
1,Lousy quality,I thought this fan would be perfect for my bathroom. What a mistake! Don't buy it. It is junk. Fan quit working (all 3 speeds) in less than one week after installation.
3,Not that great,"The installation of the fan was ok, but I felt moved to share with people that it is far from quiet. Even at low speeds, there is a considerable amount of noise from the fan vibrating so much. In a noisy space, I don't think it would matter, but in a quiet room, the least I would expect from a fan would be to be reasonably quiet at low speeds."
1,vibrating junk,"This fan provides very low wind power. However, my main complaint is that it is clear the bearings are the lowest of quality. I bought 2 of them and they both vibrate at the bearing. (If you can call it a bearing- there is no actual bearing just a shaft through a plastic sleeve.) This creates noise that travels through the walls that it is mounted on. I definately don't recommend this item. It would not have taken much engineering care or cost to create a bearing that didn't cause the entire fan to vibrate."
3,"Not great, but OK","This fan is probably too expensive for it's quality. If it came with a metal cage I could ""maybe"" justify the cost. It's easy to install and does move a lot of air, even on it's lowest setting, but it is not whisper quiet. When my unit is set to oscillate, the movement is not incredibly smooth and causes the fan to vibrate as is gets ""stuck"" before continuing on it's 90 degree swing. The intensity of the vibration comes and goes, but is always there (even on lowest setting). If I decide to get crafty, I might pull it apart and see if something can be greased/adjusted."
2,"fan ok, horrible customer service","The fan does a decent job and for the price it is not bad, we have three of these fans and they move the air pretty well and don't wobble like others have said. The big problem is with the customer service of lasko. The product came with two front covers and no back cover so I couldn't put it together. The customer service is impossible to reach and when they finally do call you back they don't answer any questions leaving you to call back the next day. If you buy the product and get all the pieces you should, you should be ok but if you have a problem with the fan...good luck."
1,????,"It did not work at all for me . But no skin of my back , the car got totaled soon after . I'm glad i walked away from the crash .This item was used and posibly was broken when was sold to me ."
4,Works great,"Had to find an alternative the the cassette based converter for the Skyfi (series one) in my wife's 2001 Jeep Cherokee when the cassette deck quit working. This seemed like the best option and it turned out great. It makes for a much cleaner installation and provides sound quality that is almost as good as the cassette. In my wife's car, the sound quality difference is minor but if you have a really nice car stereo I suspect the difference might be more noticeable. It is easy to install if you have some experience with car stereos. The signal level is rather low so you have to adjust the volume when you go back and forth between the Skyfi and the radio or cd player."
3,Not Digital.....,"It is not 100% digital quality; the modulator downgrades the signal from digital to FM stereo. Only way to get the advertised ""100% digital quality"" is via a direct connection, but this means your unit aint portable.Something to keep in mind."
3,does the job,"These are free in Turkey when you buy silver. Lost mine. They work great, but shipping was high for a one OZ item."
5,Great polish cloth for gold jewelry,"Does the job! Cloth is small, does not stain your hands, cleans andpolishes excellently! Get it for brightening up your rings!"
2,Silver Polishing Cloth,I received my polishing cloth in less than a week which was great. However after me using the cloth a few times the cloth would no longer clean my silver jewelry. So if you are looking for a cleaning cloth to last for a long while this would not be for you. I would not buy this product again.
4,It works.,"I bought this because I have a lot of silver jewelry that I wear. It does the job quite well, but on my dirtiest items, I found myself wishing I had a small toothbrush or some similar tool in order to get into the nooks & crannies without causing damage to the item itself.It takes a lot of effort to clean jewelry this way, but compared to other options, this is the safest & least damaging (in my opinion). If you don't have the time to sit down for a few hours & polish your jewelry, don't get this. Opt for something else."
5,Fantastic,"I grew up just a few miles from Ovapa, maybe even more back in the mountains. All her books take me home again and I read them over and over. I only wish all children had the opportunity to grow up like we did and be able to enjoy the outdoors and family. Seems like picnic lunches by the creek are a thing of the past, along with apple butter, stringing beans on the front porch (this was our entertainment!)and Sunday Dinner at Granny's with all the cousins to play with. Really miss those ""good old days"""
1,Stay Clear of Microtek,"I purchased a 1000XL pro about a year and a half ago. Recently it no longer communicated with any computer either through the USB2 port of the firewire. When I contacted Microtek they advised me that they had closed their repair facility and all they would do was offer me a replacement for $ 1000 with a 90 day warranty. The more I peruse the net, the more I see a litany of similar complaints. This company either needs to be taken over by a more reputable firm or closed down. I am amazed they are still in business."
2,Fixed scanner myself,"I also have the Microtck 1000XL Pro and when my scanner was 13 months and a few days old I discovered under magnification that areas in the scans had digital artifacts that would show up when the scans were printed. I called Microtck and was given the same song and dance about there being no repairs and that I could get a discount on a new scanner. After doing some reading on line I determined that dust might be the problem. I disconnected the scanner and then took off the glass top. Then with a can of air, I blew air over everything that I could access. I put the top back on and the problem was solved. I just wondered why Microtek couldn't have suggested that I try it. Had my scanner been within the first 13 months they would have replaced it. Seems crazy to have a scanner costing so much being treated like a bic lighter."
4,Porter Cable 9690 1 1/2 HP Router,"A great router for basic techniques. Very versatile and can be used in conjunction with the 693 table. This tool is also great for cutting dovetails with the Porter Cable Dovetail Template. A must have if you want a lightweight, easily transportable router."
2,"For those who like the expensive, yet rustic look.","Because I so enjoyed the Better Homes & Gardens book ""Cottage Style"", this book by Ellen M. Plante sounded like an excellent addition to my personal library. However, her book was a disappointment to me. While I would be happy to stay at most of the featured vacation homes for a week or so if the owners invited me for a visit, very few of the pictures reflect the look of relaxed, romantic comfort that I associate with cottage style. She does feature a few interiors with the feel of Scandnavian country that I really liked, but none of the rest had much appeal for me. A fine book for people actually planning to build/remodel a vacation home, but not for those of us who buy decorating books just because we enjoy the pictures and like to dream."
3,Not quite what I expected,This book was entirely photographed in the UK. I expected some US and other countries to be included. The photography is fascinating but the information was a bit boring.
1,Worst golf instructional book I ever read.,"This is the worst golf instructional book I ever read. 75% of the book is a narrative about writing the book. 15% on driving range technigues and 10% on the author having fantasy golf games with dead golf legends. Give me a break, this book belongs in the fiction section."
4,Spiritually incredible!,"It looks like Aline Barros has done it again... All the Brazilian Christian people love her sweet voice, themes, and specially the messages that all of her songs brings to us!I love it!"
3,"Good story, disappointing characters","I actually finished this book, which is a testament to the enjoyability of the story. I was just very disappointed by the dialogue and characters. I try reading Christian fiction frequently, I find it enriching, but very often I cannot get through the book because many are so poorly written. This was better than some, but had the potential to be so much more. People don't speak like the characters in this book speak. 9 year old children don't say things that Shannon says at age 9. An entertaining story, but if you're a critical reader, this may not be for you."
5,Emotional Rollercoaster Ride,"I'm not a reader of suspense, but after the first chapter of Shattered Justice, I was hooked. Karen Ball is one of the best writers I've read. The world she creates on paper becomes real, and I became invested in her characters' lives. The tension increased with the introduction of Jayce's friend, Marlin, who did not like Dan's interest in Jayce. I won't give away any endings, but the stakes got high, and I didn't want to know what was coming. Yet, I was unable to put the book down. I stayed up nearly all night reading.In Shattered Justice, Ball takes her readers on an emotional roller coaster ride, and mine had been rung dry by the time it ended. I absolutely loved it!"
5,Wow!,"Rarely do I ever find a book good enough to rate, and I've read a lot of them. This story kept me enraptured until the end! Love, loss, mystery...it was so good!"
4,Christian fiction,with a lot of drama. Get the tissue if you plan on reading this one. It brings a lot of the Word to life in the main characters. Inspiring and a very good read.One man's loss brings him and the others around him closer to God.
5,Pro Tools 7 Power is really good.,I love this book. Before reading it my life was in shambles.Cold wet concrete and darkness.The sound of distant dripping and a scurrying of something earnest and defiant in its avoidence.My temples burn. I mutter and walk in circles then stumble.Groping the fetid ground I find this book.I open to the first page and the room is flooded with sacred healing light.All that was veiled and hidded comes clear.All intents are refined and harnessed to the sublime.Music flows and is realized.The barriers between musical vision and realization are removed.All due to this humble book.No longing. No lack of longing.Two arrows meeting in mid air!MU!
1,"0 STARS GO ELSEWHERE, NEVER RECEIVED ITEM, POOR LANGUAGE SKILLS (IRONIC FOR A SELLER OF LITERATURE)","NEVER BUY HERE!!! A month and a half after ordering the book when the due date lapsed, I contacted the poor excuse of a business and they asked me to wait a further 5 days. After this time lapsed, I re-contacted they seller and they claimed they would issue a refund which I am yet to receive. They also asked me to re-order once I had received my refund, at the same time telling me that they had never actually posted the previous order in the first place. I get the feeling they have difficulty with the English language, and certainly have difficulty running a business."
5,The Height of Charm and Elegance,The Freshmen are the best thing that could happen to American Popular Song. Their gorgeous arrangements considerably enhance the harmonies of those marvellous melodies without ever destroying their basic richness. This particularly applies to the Love Lost and Voices in Love albums but to me the same can be said about most of the Freshmen Capitol output. Their reissues on the CD format are thus mostly welcome!
5,Let's fall in love,"Many people feels these two albums were the FF's best. Both gorgeous, lushly orchestrated with an unusual tasty choice of songs and vocals out of this world. Fabulous voicings and harmonies and I remember when the LPs first appeared and were widely celebrated. Anything by the group is worth getting but this is extra special."
5,"...Without a doubt , the best they ever recorded!","If your a fan of wonderful harmonies and fabulous arrangements ,'ya gotta have these.I've had them on vinyl and never thought they'd be available on c.d. The last one I got was a gift from The Freshmen's former manager back in the early '70's. Ross sent me a note and said that , at the time ,the ""Voices in Love"" album hadn't been available on Capitol for years. What a great surprise to find it now.I love these c.d.'s with soft candles , a tasty wine and tasty lady.Enjoy , Freshman fans!David - Elk Grove , Ca."
1,Wish I had read the reviews on Amazon.com prior to purchasing,"I got sick of using the standard pitcher filtration method and decided to get a faucet mount. I had to contact Brita right away for a whole new system because it wouldn't stop leaking, even WITH the plethora of extra metal connectors they sent to me. Already, the system was a pain.We never WERE able to use it without it leaking all over the place, but I guess that's the price you pay for clean drinking water. The straw that broke the camel's back was when the dial on the side became too difficult to turn. I have mobility problems, and I could no longer switch between tap and filtered water. I tried to take the unit apart to clean the buildup and couldn't even get the pieces unscrewed. I threw the whole thing in the garbage and ordered a Culligan FM-15A Level 3 Faucet Filter. BEST decision I ever made.Stay away from this faucet mount. It was cheap at WalMart, but NOT worth the frustration."
1,Poorly designed,"If you need to use one of the plastic adapters to install the unit, the entire unit will be held in place by approximately 2 threads of plastic. Turn on the water and the pressure will blow the unit off the faucet.If you call customer service like I did, you'll navigate the voice mail menu and finally receive a message to call back later. Dial tone. Just a badly engineered product with poor support."
3,Not bad,Didn't cost as much because there's no indicator when it's time to change the filter or the red to green indicator when it is filtering.
5,Love Brita products,Second one we have purchased. The old one lasted forever! Gives us fresh filtered water for drinking and cooking. City water is terrible!
2,Brita water filter,"The waterflow was more of a spray instead of a smooth solid stream.The filtering result was very satisfactory tho. changing the filter was easy,which I liked."
1,Horrible!,"I bought this faucet mount to replace my old Brita on Tap filter system, which worked great. However, this new product is NOT up to the same standards. I do not have high water pressure in my apartment, but even so, this new unit immediately started leaking and spraying water EVERYWHERE. I attempted to tighten the connector all the way to remedy the situation, but even this would not fix the problem. I immediately took it off the faucet and returned it. What a piece of junk!"
2,Worked For A While,"I had this filter for about 3 weeks, during which it worked well. There were a few times where water leaked from the connections, but it'd be a few small drops and then it'd stop. Then one morning I turned the faucet on full pressure and the entire system (even the adapter) popped off the faucet, spraying water everywhere. It's now impossible to reattach; every time I screw it back on, all of the water leaks/sprays out of the top and nothing even makes it through the filter. I can only guess that the threads are completely ruined, making it a hopeless endeavor to try to fix."
1,We just recently bought it and it is already giving trouble.,The unit keeps blowing off of the faucet...we took it off.And now we can't remove the adapter. Pissed as HELL!never again.
4,3 months and no problems,"I have had this Filtration system for 3 months now and have not had a single problem. The only thing I dislike about the unit is that the knob to switch from purified to tap is a little small and hard to turn if your hands are wet. I read some of the other reviews on here about how the seal started leaking and all kinds of other problems, I'm sure this was caused by stacking dishes against the faucet or being careless. Bottomline if you aren't a dishstacker and are looking for a good filter system then this is the one. If you are then your needs will probably better suited with a filter pitcher."
1,Worthless,"I purchased this filter and noticed that the water wasn't getting as clear as the PUR filter I once owned. Secondly, the filter keeps popping off and leaking when I turn on the water creating a big mess with water spraying all over the place. What a waste of money!"
2,Made to Strip,Seems to filter fine but is made to eventually strip its threads so that you have to buy another one.
1,Not worth it,"I returned this filter after only a few days. It leaked from the start and, what's worse, the entire unit kept popping off my faucet whenever I'd turn the water on. Needless to say, water was flying everywhere. The reason? It comes with a cheap plastic adapter that only has 2 threads on it. This is what is supposed to hold the unit to the faucet. Another annoyance is that the valve to switch between filtered and unfiltered water is not easy to turn. To replace the Brita I got a Pur unit with the LED light. It doesn't leak, it stays on the faucet, the valve is easy to turn, and above all, it comes with a metal adapter."
2,Won't leak if on full blast,"You have to have the water on all the way to keep this thing from leaking out of the sides everywhere else. I thought the smaller size would be better, but apparently I was wrong. I'll go back to the other higher priced filter when this one breaks."
2,Improved but low water flow,"Brita has finally upgraded this filter to include metal threads as part of the filter system itself. Gone are the days of the system popping off the faucet and showering your kitchen with water.Now the bad, the water flow for the non-filtered setting is barely more than the filtered setting. Good for those that want to conserve water, but bad for those that like to wash dishes."
1,Returned multiple Brita Faucet Filtration,I am more than finished with this product and the entire company. I've had numerous faucet systems continuously pop off the faucet. I'm going to give the PUR faucet filtration system a try today! Don't waste your money on this system. It continually falls off the faucet soaking your face and clothes with sprays of water!
1,Does not stay on faucet,"I purchased this product without researching it first, so shame on me. It is just a poorly designed, poorly made, cheap piece of junk. It recently fell off my faucet as I was hand-washing a bowl I was fond of, smashing it to pieces. I am in the market for a new filter."
2,"Filters, but cheap design","Filters water like it should, but..If you want to turn this on, you have to have it set to normal water flow first. If it's set to filter when you turn it on, the filter shoots off like a rocket and sprays water everywhere. Sometimes it gently pops off, sometimes it slams into the cabinets above my sink. I honestly think this thing could knock out a tooth if you were standing over it."
1,bad very bad,Turning the switch to the filter and non filter is a real pain in the hand.Threw it in the thrash today.Then got pur and its easier to turn and now im happy.
2,Poorly designed,"The connection to the faucet is dicey... not a lot of room on those threads. Worse, I am presently searching for other brands because the lever to turn the filtered water off and on is stunningly awkward and hard to manage. You must have strong ""pincher"" fingers and the slightest slipperiness spells doom... you will need a dish towel or cloth to help you turn the ""switch""--it's just too small to easily turn. What were they thinking when they tested this model? Also, the green light/red light indicator for a saturated filter has never worked. C'mon, Brita. You can do better. As far as I know, the quality of the water is fine; it tastes okay; makes good coffee."
1,Definitely a step down,"We bought this to replace our old Brita faucet filter that had started leaking and was in general worn out after a few years of use. This thing sucked from Day 1. I don't even have to use the plastic connecters with our faucet... it directly attaches to it, but it still leaks no matter how well it's on. The mesh on the inside got entirely warped the first time I attached it to the faucet and tightened it because it does not fit well. The knob on the side does not easily turn either so I almost feel like I'm pulling the filter off just trying to turn it. I wish I hadn't tossed our old one right away. :("
1,"Leaks, leaks, leaks","The plastic threads immediately get stripped, no matter how careful you are. Despite trying washers and teflon tape, I still have no luck using this without having it shoot streams of water from the sides.Very bad design."
4,Brita water faucet filter,we have used the Brita water filter for a long time.It is easy to install and use. We recce mend it to anyone.
1,Filter won't lock on,"I just bought one of these at the local grocery store and after a lot of fumbling around I was finally able to attach the base to the faucet. However, when I tried to attach the filter to the base it wouldn't lock in place and when I turned the water on it popped off and water went everywhere. Needless to say I'll be returning it."
1,One of the worst design I have ever used,"I have used Brita for many years, and last year after I moved to a new place I bought the only model they had in store. Quickly after I bought it I regretted the moment. It is hard and annoying trying to switch between filtered and non-filtered water. What was the designer thinking?"
1,Get a different model or a different brand all together,"I've long been a fan of faucet-mounted filters and have used Brita in the past. However, after moving cross country and forgetting to bring our last filter with us, we bought the 35214 for the new house. I was a bit skeptical about the indicator, because I really loved the flashing LED on the last Brita we had. I should've listened to my intuition. Most days, it was difficult to see what it was showing. The worst part about this filter, though, is the switch. I shouldn't have to twist the switch with the force it takes to remove machine-tightened lug nuts off a car tire. The entire filter is just designed so poorly that it's not worth it. Either buy a different model from Brita or get a different brand all together."
1,No Good,"Became so difficult to switch the faucet from regular to filtered water. At first it was fine, but after a few months the switch was such a pain to turn off and on. I have pains in my hand because I continued to use this for a while even after it became difficult, my doctor said it was probably tendonitis. I plan to call Brita and complain, what a crappy product."
2,Not worth the headaches,"This product does work and produces great tasting water--for a while. I thought maybe we'd done something to make it leak, but a guest said his did the same thing in about the same amount of time (approx 8 months).There's a part of the filter assembly that becomes loose and leaks, and then eventually squirts water all over the place. There is no way to fix it.We won't be buying this brand again."
1,Need a wrench to turn it on and off,"For the first couple of months, it works okay.The knob became very hard and impossible to turn.I have purchased the replacement filters but I didn't need them cause the knob had a trouble before the original filter is gone.I definitely recommend Brita 42622 or 42201, 42633 which has different knob design.I recently purchased Brita 42633 with black and chrome color. The knob is much better to turn and works perfect so far."
2,Knob is Very Hard to Turn,"I have this filter - while it filters just fine and mine has never fallen off, the knob has become impossible to turn after only 4 months or so and I actually have to use a wrench to turn it. I will be upgrading ASAP"
1,Brita 35214 Base Faucet Filtration System,"Brita 35214 Base Faucet Filtration SystemHaving bought several different brands and models of faucet water filters over the years, none have held up to extended use, and all failed. But this model is the worst ever, trashed it today. No more faucet mounted water filters for me.This model is very-very hard to turn on and off, leaks, always seemed to be in the way, indicator never turned red, even after months of use, and the replacement cost of filters is outrageous.I can't recommend this product to anyone."
2,Don't buy this!,"After I had tried a Pur faucet filter that started spraying water after only about a couple of weeks, I decided to buy the more expensive Brita faucet filter, because some friends of mine have had theirs for years, and it works great. Little did I know that the ""new"" design - knob in place of a slider, like theirs has, - was so bad that the tiny piece was very difficult to use to switch from unfiltered water to filtered and back, and what's worse, after 2 or 3 weeks it became impossible to turn altogether. It just doesn't work. Even my husband, who's 6ft, 200 lbs, can't do it.Why did Brita have to change the old design? Indeed, don't try to improve what's good....Don't buy this product, you'll be throwing money to the wind!"
1,AWFUL,"First got this back in May 2011, by September all the seals were gone, it leaks like hell and it doesn't stay attached to my faucet anymore. The valve is designed for Gorillas who have ridiculously strong grip, because the lever is about the diameter of a dime and it's somewhat triangular shape so you can't get any leverage on the LEVER. HORRIBLE JUNK! DO NOT BUY! I normally do research on items before I buy them but in this case I didn't and I took a chance. I got burned! I normally don't post reviews angry but this one deserves it!Pros:Great ideaeasy setup (for the most part)CheapConsBulkyCHEAPPlastic threadspoor sealssmall valve leverplasticand everything else about it."
1,"Don't bother, with this one (Sorry, Brita)...","I rather like their filtering pitcher, but the on-faucet filter is a piece of junk. Why?? It blows off the faucet, right out of the box.I called Brita, & they sent a bunch of adapters. Still blew itself off the faucet, twice in a night. The problem, was, the filter would not tighten on the adapters. If the screw-on part was metal, NO PROBLEM, I am certain, because the [PUR] filter it was supposed to replace --two years + old, & finally leaking around the seams-- has a metal attaching apparatus. Will have to continue using it, until I can find a replacement.Thank goodness, for Amazon's excellent returns policy."
2,One month out of warranty,"This system was great for a while. The threads didn't strip like others have stated, but eventually, just a month out of warranty, water started leaking from the back of the unit. Now, only half the makes it through the system into the cup."
1,unusable! cant turn nob to filter water,"dont buy this, it is practically impossible to change from filtered to unfiltered with the small, tight nob. It is also very loud and makes a screeching sound when water is in non-filtered mode."
1,Not impressed,"I am currently using my second piece of Faucet filtration system. The first one died after a few months and i thought i should give it another shot since it does take the bad taste out of water. A few months into using my second piece, i started having the same problem again! Essentially the entire unit will pop off the faucet. As highlighted by several others, the threads are poorly made and wears out easily. I have resorted to using parafilm strips to lace the threads so as to make the grip better. It works better but still pops every now and then.Once I use up my remaining 2 filters, this trash is going straight to where it belongs..."
4,at least 4-5 great songs,"As a fan going back to Grupo Mania, I have not been disappointed by this CD, although maybe 3-4 songs are too popish for me. Still, with Tu sonrisa, suavemente and luna llena, there is plenty of hard driving merengue here. I've been working out to this CD and I swear I go twice as fast during the top speed merengues -- I never get tired of his ""pequena, echate pa'ca"". For some reason I find Elvis endearing. If he stays away from the cheesy stuff and sticks to merengue, he'll continue to stay at the top of modern merenguistas."
5,I love this cd it's the best one I heard of all his cd's,This CD is cool because I known all the words of the whole CD all my friends injoy it
5,"""Enchanting"" ...Definitely a must have!!!",The first time I heard Elvis Crespo's music was at a concert he had at Bellas Artes in Puerto Rico I fell in love with it instantly...the music and Elvis him self who went out of his way to make sure everyone had fun. I have both CD's and love all the songs. If you like one song you will definitely like all.
5,dance your heart out !,"This fabulous merengue CD is a non-stop exhilarating delight...if you don't feel the irresistible urge to get up and dance, check your pulse. You don't even have to know how to merengue, this CD will teach you how ! The smash hit title track and ""Luna Llena"" are my favorites, but the entire CD is excellent...there are no ""fillers"" here. Crespo shows his writing talent here with ""Suavemente"" and ""Tu Sonrisa"" and his infectious, energetic voice is perfect for this type of music. The man has soul...and don't forget to read the ""agradecimientos"" after amazon.com has rushed this CD to your door, they're lovely."
2,"Buy the single, not the album","I find it hard to believe that amazon.com actually compared Elvis Crespo to Juan Luis Guerra. Juan Luis Guerra's music is much more diverse, and the lyrics have so much more substance than the repetitive, shallow words of Elvis Crespo. While the music does indeed give you the urge to dance, none of the songs really stand out from his huge hit- they all sound similar. This album is a far cry from the music of other artists."
3,???,"Elvis Crespo is certainly one of the premier lyricists of contemporary Latin popular music. ""Softly. Kiss me. I want to feel your lips. Ooooo... Kiss me again."" Well, maybe something gets lost in the translation. O.K., so he's no Ricardo Montaner, who cares? Merengue is rhythm music, lyrics are secondary, If you can dance to it and the melody is catchy you're half way there. EC does have a distinctive, if rather nasal tone to his singing, and looks a little different from your average merenguero which doesn't hurt with the ladies. On the other hand, his songs tend to be in the same key and tempo with the same rhythm (Oh, sorry, were talking about merengue, aren't we, now?) Pintame, amame, besame, abrazame, mimame, change the lyrics slightly while keeping the same tune and he could probably have a whole string of hits. Then again, all of Ricky Martin's music sounds alike to me so maybe the subtleties of EC's work are over my head."
4,To Each His/Her Own...!...?,"Everybody is going to have their own opinion...me...i like Elvis Crespo. Energetic, Fun and a song that will never die! Say what you want about E.C. he has created a song that will forever be a favorite on the dancefloor...i simply refuse to play songs twice but i can't say no to my customers and clients...they more than often Have to hear ""Sauvemente"" more than once...at the clubs i DJ at i always try to save it for after 12:30 ...1am...to close out my last latino set. Yes there are a few good songs here...Tu Sonrisa....Princesita to name a few. Bottom line is...E.C. has a song that will always be a HEATER and wheather you like him or not that won't change. I do agree that on the authentic side he isn't...but fun and good for my dance floor he is always gonna be!!! Thanks for Savemente!!!...p.s. remember...2 each his/her own! music is all about the love!!!"
3,"Great CD, unfortunately all of the songs sound similar.","I really enjoy listening to this CD, however, each song sounds like the one I just heard. But Elvis Crespo does have a great voice and the music is fun to listen to."
5,SUAVEMENTE - LUNA LLENA,"Me encanta Elvis Crespo, porque es muy latino y su mÃºsica es para todas las edades. Super bailable y aunque Ã©l no es apuesto, a todos cae bien. Es Buenisiiiimooooo!"
4,Very Pleased with Purchase,"Amazon.com did it again. It was relatively easy to find this product. It took a click to order it, and it arrived ahead of schedule. It was exactly what I wanted. Very pleased that I have what I want."
2,YUKKKKKK,"ESTE TIPO CANTA PEOR QUE CHALINO SANCHEZ, Y LA MUSICA APESAR QUE ES CONTAGEOSA,SE REPITE MUCHOY EL TIPO REPITE SUS PALABRAS MAS Y MAS. POR FAVOR SI QUIEREN MERENGE AHI MUCHOS ARTISTAS QUE SI VALEN LA PENA."
3,HA! HA! GET REAL................,"Some of the songs on this album is o.k. But I'd like to know who came up with the idea thinking that this guy is the king of the merengue??? I mean, I bet he does'nt even know how to play a tambora.... There's a lot of other merengueros that can easily put this guy to shame. And yes, that's a fact!!!!!!!! I just bet that whoever came up with the idea that this guy is the so called ""king of the merengue"" was'nt Dominican........PapyDave #1(EL PUNAL) papydave@hotmail.com"
1,IS EVERYBODY BLIND?,"I mean, c'mon people, This guy is a hoax! You don't need to be a master musician or even an avid listener to realize that every single track on this so-called-album sounds exactly the same, and all the lyrics are sung to the same 2-3 notes over and over. Is that what you guys are calling the ""creative force"" behind next century's merengue? Besides, his voice is utterly annoying, sort of like a male Fran Drescher, and the guy is ugly as hell. If you want true merengue, go out and listen to Rikarena, Bananas, Sergio Vargas, etc... there are so many out there, but this guy's media overexposition and terrible sound are enough to make anyone with a decent ear for music sick. This guy should be thankful I'm giving him a full star."
2,"Not a good singer, i.m.o.","I can not even comment on the quality of the songs and musicans (some of it sounds pretty good), because, in my opinion, Elvis Crespo has a terrible voice. I find his singing nasal and winey to the point of being almost unlistenable.I hate to say it, but I just can't get thru this album because I just don't like his voice! Well, to each his own."
3,Catchy pop/merengue,"All of the songs are catchy...only problem is they all sound the same. ""Suavemente"", ""Tu Sonrisa"", ""Luna Llena"" and previous work with Grupo Mania all have the same beat and horns. The CD is upbeat and fun to listen to, but come on Elvis, come up with some new material."
5,Classic church hymns sung beautifully,"On this cd, Shelia, backed by the Kings Singers, lends her beautiful voice to the performance of many classic hymns of thechurch such as Fairest Lord Jesus, It Is Well With My Soul,Near To The Heart Of God,Great Is Thy Faithfulness and more.If you like hearing the old hymns of the church and hearingthem sung most beautifully, you'll enjoy this inspiring cd."
2,Not good enough,"This lens adaptor is not a good one, images taken with this lens are not very sharp and it does not pair well with a DSRL with a good lens. It's an beginner enthusiast's lens for his first camera."
1,wAAY too easy,"A grandma could do all the stuff in this video. I was not expecting that even from volume one. Was looking for a cheap alt. to felix cane's tutorials, but DEFINITELY not close to the quality"
5,best ufc EVER!!!,"If you are a big frankie edgar fan like i am, this is a must have. Gray was frankies only loss, there meeting in january was bullshit. Edgar won that fight, and frankie knocks out gray. Gray is a low life, i say go frankie"
5,I just cant stop listening to Vertigo!!!,"I did'nt buy this CD because of ""I see you baby""(I've heard the edit on Kiss FM many times), I bought it because it sounded pretty interesting and when I listened to it, I felt like I was addicted to some kind of drug! My personal favorites are ""Chicago"",""If everybody looked the same"",and ""Dusk you & me"".This is one of the albums that really got me into house music and how it SHOULD be......"
5,Pure Audio Inebriation,"For anyone who is planning on buying this album for the track ""I see you baby"", stop right there. If you are looking for crap you have come to the wrong place. Despite one well intentioned discripancy this is one of the best albums every made. Tracks like Dusk You & Me, and At The River transport you to beautiful, dreamy soundscapes while the trip-hop sounds of Whatever, Whenever are thrown in to mix things up. I bought this album on a whim having never knowingly heard Groove Armada. The album gathtered dust for a brief time until I gave it a true listen and realized the gem I possesed. Groove Armada deserves every accolade they receive and the only time Vertigo leaves my sound systems is to be replaced with their first album, Northern Star. Kudos to Groove Armada!"
4,Me like.,"Great driving music. Once I put it in, it is hard to take it out of the stereo. If you like this, you will also like Theivery Corporation, Air, Tosca, Kruder & Dorfmeister, or Peace Orchestra."
5,At The River... Groove Armada style,"Wow. That's it, wow. Buy this CD and listen to track number 9. At first, you'll think ""um, ok. It's nice. No big deal"". But i guarantee you you'll become addicted to this song. The trumpets. Patti PAge's voice. The harmonies. All in all... this may be one of the best songs on this CD. It's the reason i believe Groove Armada is more than talented, and has future."
3,Style over Content,"While Groove Armada's release ""Vertigo"" is a good, pleasant album to listen to, it's far from its ratings. I think there is a lot of confusion here between style and content. It's hip, it's funky, and it's fun with attitude, but it lacks inner creativity. It's obvious they the artists are trying <<really>> hard on this one. I'd much rather be listening to Moby's ""Play"" or Bent's ""Programmed to Love."" Sometimes you gotta draw the line on hype and pretense. My pencil has marked it."
2,Some great - but overrated,"A couple of great tracks in Inside My Mind (spooky, trippy good), and At The River. Good to have/get - but under produced and overrated."
1,"Fatboy fans, don't be fooled!","I'm sorry to interrupt the Groove Armada love-in, but I feel I must do this as a service to those who might make the same mistake I did. I really liked I See You Baby when I saw the video and I figured that this was a good Fatboy Slim clone band that would tide me over until Fatboy himself released his own new album. I then saw the CD and realized that the song sounded like Fatboy Slim because he's the one that mixed the video version! That led me to fear that the rest of the album would be completely different, and alas, I was right. The rest of the album is chock full of Air-ish, Moby-ish, subdued, funky, jazzy, ambient pastiche. I mean, if you like that stuff, fine, BUT DON'T LURE ME IN WITH A VIDEO THAT IS TOTALLY MISLEADING AS TO WHAT YOU ARE ALL ABOUT! Fatboy fans, stay away and patiently wait for his new stuff to come out. The rest of you can now continue to praise the sophisticated grooves of the Armada."
3,"a good listen, typical Groove Armada style","You either like or don't like Groove Armada and they are a good listen with some really good tracks, however many listeners who are not used to progressive house and such will find it repetitive and drole. I find this a good rhythmic album and has some nice nuances that are typical of Groove Armada."
1,"A great album, but I will only give it 1 star.","This is NON-STOP hard house. Absolutely insane, wild and overwhelming beats. This is the best CD in the world."
4,"Good, general purpose filters","These MERV 12 filters are a nice step up from the fiber filters you get in the local hardware store. They felt-like pleat really capture the dirt.This is a huge filter, so it's hard for a piece of cardboard to remain rigid. During the summer when the humidity is higher, I've had the filter get sucked into my air handler, though I honestly think that the fault of my filter port - there's no cross beam to provide support for the center of the filter. However, keep this in mind if you're buying a large filter like this.Not much more to say - the filters do their job and you throw them away every month or two. It's not a sexy part of your HVAC system, but it's an essential one."
4,good for calming the soul,This composition of Koto music is exeptional. It is ideal for the use of calming one's mind and soul and perfect to listen to after a long day's work.
2,Not Christie's best,"Hmmm. I'm struggling to give Agatha Christie such a low rating. She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into. Not quick reads, but very methodical with lots of character development. I don't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters, but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending. Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the ""who, where and why"" were finally revealed in the end. I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I didn't know who the killer was, but actually because I already knew who and how. I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious. Very disappointing. Christie books I would recommend instead - ABC murders, And Then There Were None and Murder of Roger Ackroyd."
4,Very Good.,"It's a very good book, although I wouldn't say it's the best I've read. If you like Agatha you should read it."
4,A thrilling mystery that keeps you guessing till the end.,"This book was one of the finest book i've ever read. Hercule is a strong charater looking to helpo an old friend . The book is well written, so that clues are presented to you without you really truley noticing. I recommend this book to everyone especially for reports. It keeps you guessing to the end who-done-it, which is a pleasent surprise! If you want some good mystery in your life read this book!!"
4,Another entertaining book from Damm Christie,"Although this book is not as well know as other ""must reads"" by Agatha, I still consider it one of the finest one. As always, the story is full of suprises, the plot is complex, and characters are fully developed. If u are a fan of Agatha, I'm sure u will love it. If u are going to read Agatha for the first time though, I suggest u to try ""And then there were none"", ""Murder of Roger Akroyd"", and of course ""Death on the Nile"" and ""Murder on Oriental Express."""
1,This movie is like Jurassic Park without dinosaurs.,"This movie had great potential but blew it. The setting was good, the effects were well done, but there were very few monsters in this movie at all; the first real aliens don't really show up until 45 minutes into it. The dialogue was really awful, and the characters were paper-thin. All in all, it was pretty boring."
1,What the heck were they thinking?,"This movie bills itself as a monster movie but is anything but. It uses this alternate reality as a back drop about a guy and a girl making a difficult journey. During the trip they learn a lot about themselves and the other. However, I wanted a Monster movie. I give this movie two thumbs down."
1,A boring waste of time and money,This movie was a complete bore and the characters were completely impossible to relate to. Basically a goofy love story with a backdrop of aliens. Biggest problem: the characters reaction to everything going on around them makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.I wish I could get me 3.99 and 2 hours back. Skip this one.
1,One of the all time worst films!,"This is really an example of low-budget, no imagination, poor acting, deplorable writing and no discernable direction. Two unappealing characters meander through a shoddy landscape, trying to avoid monsters. The monsters are giant squids that you don't see much of, and when you do, you hope for them to kill the two main characters. The movie disappoints on every conceivable level. The trailer is cut to make this film look interesting - don't be deceived."
1,Wish I had my hour and a half back!,"This is an emotional drama not a sci-fi or horror flick. It's the story of two white 20 somethings who grapple with not being happy. Yawn. It has just enough plot to keep you watching. ANy worse and I'd just turn ot off. A little better and at least you could be mildly entertained a bit. The ""monster"" scenes (if you call watching CGI octopus aliens fornicate watching monsters)are all shot in the dark. All. A few dead body parts in daylight. No whole monsters were ever to be seen in the light. It was just entertaining enough, just enough, so you can keep watching hoping that any minute this will get a little bit like ""signs"" scairy (which it never does). The characters were annoying, the effects lacking, and the script mediocre. I'm left wondering if a new edit of it might make it a little more tolerable, or if this was the best edit possible."
1,"Extremely dull, definitely falls into the cheap B movie category","Was so disappointed, with all the hype about it. What a DULL movie!!! The story line is just terrible, there's nothing to it... Didn't see any aliens until about 46 min. into the movie, and that was only for a moment, really didn't see anything til the end, and even then, was nothing to write about. The entire movie is about 2 people on a road trip. Not worth the money."
1,Inept movie in every way,"The special effects in this film really are nonexistent. What few brief glimpses obtained of the creatures are rapidly diminished by the insipid behavior of our hero and heroin.At no point in the movie are scenes of vast destruction seen. Only the aftermath of a visit by some form of creature is observed. How can aircraft be downed by 50 ft tall beasties? Can they leap tall buildings at a single bound?Boats are flung ashore, tanks are heaped into piles, all by what?If a sequel is produced and one is planned I believe, more monsters are promised. What monsters? I bought this movie and I am sorry I did, it is not worth the money. One star is fortunate for this piece of trash."
1,Not for everyone,"I would have liked this movie more if I could root for either of the main two characters. I found myself hoping they would die and get it over with, especially the male character. For a journalist he struck me as pretty dumb and annoying. I also couldn't relate to the female character. Not to be funny, but no way would I give a stranger (she has only known the guy for about 24 hours at this point) my passport to hold on to. I would also not get offended if the guy who she has only known for about 24 hours slept with some strange woman he picked up in the bar.I found both characters pretty annoying over all. No matter the budget or the story if you can't relate or root for the main people it isn't going to be enjoyable. I won't watch it again, unless it becomes an interactive movie and I get to shoot them both in the head."
1,Horrible Movie. Horrible Acting. 3 minute Moster only.,I think the only people giving this movie good reviews has got to be the people who work on the film because nothing that is said by these other guys fits???The worst movie me and my kids have ever seen. The plot was great. However the acting was awful. The photography was awful. You never saw any monster until the end which I know why......it was stupid.Without a question the worst movie I have ever seen in 50 years. My kids and I still complain about it even after three week.Avoid...Avoid....Avoid...!!!!!
2,Watch the trailer...and not the movie,While the acting and cinematography were good--and the effects decent--Monsters missed the mark for a good scary movie.
2,"Not the worst ""monster"" movie I've seen, but the worst I've seen in years...","Just picked up this movie from the library the other day. On the DVD jacket it says such things as ""Not your typical monster movie!"" and ""Best monster movie of the year!"" The first statement is entirely true. This is not a typical monster movie. The second statement could only be true if no other monster movies were released in the same year as this movie. Though the premise seems pretty OK, and the production of the movie seems to be pretty high quality, the story-telling is dull and the movie ends with little direction or closure. This isn't a movie you'll watch again and again. Once is plenty! The movie actually moves very slowly and the romantic attempts in the movie fall completely flat. Not a big surprise as they seems completely implausible to begin with. Give this one a pass, is my opinion."
2,Monsters Disappoints,"This critic's darling because it only cost $15,000.00 to make and the creatures were created on a home computer is only noteworthy for those reasons. The truth as I see it is that this is a boring and not in the least bit scary monster movie. Its dull and uninteresting cinematography and storyline does involve two likable actors who predictably sort of fall for each other. The rest is hooey and pretty much a complete waste of time. I am really sorry I bought it...."
1,"Why did they call it ""Monsters""","Wery good acting, very good filming and editing....but where are the monsters?You see a ""monster"" (octopusy) 3 times at large range and one time the arms of the monster close up...????Give me a break here, the movie should change title to ""the long walk home to US""There is one thrilling scene and that is at the very last at the gas station...the rest is pure waste of time, seen from a monster lovers point of view"
3,Better to rent than buy.,I expected action and monsters. But it was more a love story which is not what I expected or wanted. It was a good movie but I kept waiting for the action or an explanation of what was going on. It seems sci-fi movies are trying to be more artsy instead of trilling. If I want artsy I will so see a documentary not what I thought was suppose to be a movie about monsters.
2,disappointing,"So, i'm kind of a sucker for SciFi monster type movies. They're often cheesey, but still entertaining. Sadly, this film had more of the former and less of the latter. You probably watched the trailer so you don't need a synopsis. Basically, the writing and acting sucked. SOOOOO cheesey. These scenes we're meant to buy are just too contrived and character development is rushed. (Granted the movie's only 94 minutes.) These characters go from being total strangers, cold and distant, to being friends like they had been for years and then romantic in a matter of days. Felt the main character de-evolved from and able and savvy journalist to a college frat boy on spring break. The one ok thing about the movie, interspersed between scenes of lame dialogue, there are a handful of mediocre to pretty cool monster sequences. The creatures themselves were kinda cool. Don't think it's worth $9.99 BUT it's better to pay that then $20+ at the theater."
4,Very Good Movie,"First off, for all you haters out there, just because this Sci-Fi movie isn't done by Michael Bay or Speilberg, with tons of CGI crap, doesn't make it a bad movie. It's actually a very well done movie. A great script, a great cast (oh my God, no huge stars? So what!), and a good tale. Watch this. Don't expect crazy special effects or lots of loud unneeded explosions. You will get a great story though, a great film."
5,Definitely enjoyable.,"A great movie to relax and watch. Order a pizza, grab a friend and put on this thoroughly enjoyable movie."
2,Should have been better.,"Boring, long, confusing ending (yes, I know, it was trying to be cool, but it wasn't), disorganized. To be fair, I know there were only two crew members, and that there was little script to speak of. I can tell. It's amazing what you can do with minimal money and, yes, a studio would've wasted more money to tell a worse story. But, still, it was not a good movie.If you like experimental filmmaking, you might really enjoy this. Otherwise, move on."
2,"Classic ""B"" movie","I had read a lot of glowing reviews of this movie so I was eager to watch it. A bit disappointing. The dialog, story, and acting are bit flat. Only the occasional appearance of a monster added interest. One thing I really liked about the picture was that it was shot in Mexico and that gave a real flavor of what that country is like."
4,Monsters review,"A great and suspenseful movie.Filmed by hand camera ,was a thrilling look into an alien invasion and the apocalyptic outcome!"
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],"So, the monsters are giant, walking, glowing, octopus, from outer space, and towards the end of the film you get to see them have sex. Oh no, I am not kidding. Despite its original title and awful special effects, Monsters, is not a bad story. It is however another example of a writer, using science fiction, to promote his own agenda and bigotry. The infected zone is Mexico and you're safe once you get to America. How about the largest man made structure in the world? A wall to keep the aliens out of the USA. As for the acting, it was two newcomers who actually were pretty good, but whom are easily overlooked. It's because Monsters is one of those movies, where you keep waiting for something to happen and it never does. It had good potential, but was just painfully boring...unless of course you enjoy octopus sex."
4,Good Film,"Considering that this was a low budget, indie film, I found it pretty good. Not a lot of the action and high end special effects that movies with a much bigger budget would have, but still enjoyable, nonetheless."
4,"An effective and well-made, low-budget film well worth watching.","If you are looking for another Transformers, Cloverfield or Aliens this may not be the movie for you. If you looking for a well-made, often beautifully shot and thoughtful film with a very human nature and just enough of the monsters to make it exciting,then definitely watch this film. Sure, there are no jungles or mayan ruins in northern Mexico, but so what? The story of two Americans trying to get back home through alien infested territory is engrossing and satisfying. The natural performances by the two leads are convincing and effective while the side characters are very good considering that most of the other folks in the movie are not professional actors. All in all, Monsters is an entertaining and satisfying film that should please both fans of science-fiction and those who merely want to watch a good movie. Spoiler alert: If you want to understand the ending, watch the film and then go back and watch the opening scene again."
1,Most Boring Drawn Out movie Ever,This movie is so slow paced its not worth watching. The whole movie you follow two main characters through Mexico. This movie would serve better as a documentary on coke smugglers and drug dealers more so than any type of movie with suspense or action.
1,"Monsters, don't waste your time.","Most boring monster movie I have ever watched. You never see any monsters. it's just a movie about aliens crossing the border using the premise of outer space aliens to represent what they are really talking about, illegal aliens sneaking into the country. Trying to make it look like the people trying to stop them are the bad guys.Don't waste your money buying this movie."
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"basically this is no action, only two boring people trying to leave Mexico falling in love, there was hardly any monster/ or alien(it was never told what they were), and when they did show up it was at the last 5 min of the film, and they were having sex....very boring movie...so if you are looking for a District 9, or Cloverfield then this is not the movie"
1,Sucktacular,Stay away if you don't wanna waste 1.5hr of your life. I was expecting something to happen throughout the movie but nothing! Movie is LAME LAME LAME LAME LAME!!!!!!!!
1,ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzz,"Although the premise of this movie was somewhat intriguing, the characters, editing, pacing, and acting were not. I've heard of slow, but THIS was slower than a 3-legged turtle. It seems that aliens have landed and occupied earth six years ago, there is now an ""infected"" zone where you cannot leave, and a wall has been constructed in keep people in/out. Yeah, I get the symbolism there, but this movie becomes an exercise in a very lame excuse to tell a love story. I didn't care for either character, the monsters look like floating octopi, and I never felt the characters were in peril of anything--except their own insipidness (if that's even a word). So go ahead and watch...BORE yourself to death..."
3,Not bad at all,Good suspense. Good plot. Acting was great. Sound effects and CG was very good. A little slow. It's not an action flick.
2,Misleading,"The cast and script were more than adequate--where the movie fell down was billing it as a ""thriller"" and ""horror"". It was neither of these things. As a think piece, it was quite good; what a shame that it must disappoint those audiences who are actually expecting the Monster movie that it was billed as for it certainly is not that. My poor review reflects, in part, that disappointment. If you watch this movie expecting a morality play, a think piece, with quite tame moments of suspense, then you will not be disappointed. Quite the opposite. The other issue may be nit picky--i felt the dark lighting went a little too far. In the interests of evoking a mood, most of the film is shot at night. It came across as almost too dark to see on my pc, hence a large portion of the film's ambience was lost in a dark splotch that would last minutes at a time. This problem is probably rectified on the large screen--one would hope so in any case."
3,Just OK... Not worth 10 bucks to see...,"After all the hype and great reviews Monster was a real letdown... The main characters were, well, boring and unbelieveable and far too much time was wasted getting to the main story which felt rushed. This movie screams ""low Budget"". I expected more and more could have been done. Very disappointed in this movie...Yet, I give it 3 stars,,, for effort."
4,I liked it.,"The movie is interesting and has some decent character development. The story does seem to go slow at times and the ending is... well, sad and abrupt."
4,As great as CLOVERFIELD should have been!,"First off, there are plenty of ""Monsters"" in this film. Second, this time they're actually scary, frightening things that will make your skin crawl. If you are looking for an intelligent fright-fest, look no further."
2,"Production values were good, but that's about it.","A movie called Monsters, with basically only one monster attack scene? Production values were first rate, but the movie did not meet expectations for the genre."
3,The second time around....,"Saw this movie when it initially came out and didnt like it. Bought the dvd and it was ok. Not a giant monster movie as billed. Drama about human nature. Dont buy, but Netflix it if you care to watch. Its not bad, just expected something way diffrent."
2,Wasted Potential,"Realistic characters, understated dialog, good cinematography and special effects all come up short in what appears to be an off-hand statement on current American Immigration Policies and the demographic shift in the southwest. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best parts. Disappointed not only with the money spent to rent it but the lost opportunity to make a genuine monster movie. Watch Cloverfield or Alien Raiders instead."
2,Movie was dull,"Mainly this is a movie about two people going on a journey, it just so happens that they are going through an area where alien monsters live. Nothing really exciting happens and it just seems to go on forever. I kept waiting for the good part, it just wasn't there.They could have just made a movie about a couple traveling together without the alien backdrop, because the aliens had very little to do with it.The movie did prove a point though, that you can have F-22's in a movie and it can still be boring."
3,monster thoughts,"Interesting film, sometimes a little slow, but worth watching, especially if you enjoy alien-monster themes. Deals metaphorically, although rather transparently, with issues surrounding immigration between Mexico and U.S."
2,"Slow Moving, Bad Script","The pacing is terrible. Everything moves entirely too slowly and, when there is movement, it's jumbled and nonsensical. There's overall poor transitioning and a suspect cast; though, possibly the problem is the source--the script. The imagery in the scenes is also not well thought out and the directing is bad. The premise is interesting, but the execution is far-fetched, to the point of being boring because there's no realism, so no concern, for the characters, and, to ""add salt to injury,"" there's nothing really interesting happening."
3,GIANT LAND SQUID-OCTOPUS,"The film starts out as an"" Andromeda Strain"" on steroids. An alien life form that resembles a giant land squid-octopus migrates across ""The Infected Zone"" of northern Mexico. The locals seemed to have adapted to the monsters , perhaps better than Louisiana has adapted to Hurricanes.Andrew Kaulder (Scoot McNairy) is a US photo journalist who is eager to take pictures of the creatures and the havoc they cause. When a rich man's daughter (Whitney Able) gets trapped in Mexico he is tasked to stop what he is doing and escort her back to the US.The film is rather dull in that it focuses on the couple, their travels, and misadventures. It doesn't pick up until an hour into the feature. I found the feature to be over hyped and over rated with an ""R"".Parental Guide : 1-2 F-bombs, no sex, no nudity. Not much in the violence area either."
3,A different kind of sci-fi Movie,"Very well produced, well acted film. The title and the trailer are misleading. The movie actually moves quite slow with lots of dramatic atmosphere as a couple try to escape a devastated region of Central America You rarely see the monsters except at the end of the movie. It's a very good film but different from what i expected so I'm not sure if I liked it or not. I'll have to give it another viewing."
1,Cheap Si-Fi with some typical love entanglement,"Not even worth while renting. All the reviews seem to be written by those who have some vested interest in the film. A lot of cheap movie shots of Mexico somewhere and homes still not repaired from Hurricane Katrina event. Standard boy meets girl who is already engaged but ends up not wanting to getting married to her husband to be, but falls in love with the guy she has the adventure with. Like the last Titanic movie disaster. I waste a lot of time watching movies, and this was very much of a waste of time. The final seen of the monsters is some kind of land walking Octopus types with a lot of extra arms, which could not exist on land. The Octopus type body is made only for a water environment and could not move on land. And these monsters were not all that distinct. The monsters do a lot of guttural and screeching sounds. Very stupid. At the end you have the two main actors staring at these monsters with mouth open wonderment."
1,"Wow, this is tedious, slow, boring - make you want to gnaw your foot off to escape boring","This movie is horrible. It is tied with Battlefield Earth for the worst movie ever created. The characters are un-interesting, it is tediously slow, the plot is non existant. It is about as exciting as watching people ride the city bus, which by the way is probably 1/2 this movie. Watching them ride in a bus, taxi, boat. It's like they made a total of 60 seconds of special effects then later just said 'hey, film these painfully boring people riding around Mexico for 90 minutes to pad the film"" Half way into the movie I was so bored that I started to fast forward to the ""good parts"". Guess what? There are not really any good parts. It literally gets interesting for 10seconds then 20more minutes of pad the filmKeep in mind. I'm not a movie snob. I appreciate everything from art house movies, to blockbusters, to cheesy B movies. They all have there merits. This movie, however has no redeeming value."
1,Slow. Very Slow.,"This was very disappointing. The build up took so long I had lost interest in the fate of the main two characters, the f/x were B-movie laughable (and not in a good, kitschy way) and the usual series of ludicrously stupid decisions to push the plot along one sees in this type of movie were beyond farcical. The main redeeming quality was the documentary feel which could have been edgy but this shooting style was wasted on a mundane movie I wish I had never wasted my time or money watching."
2,Not very good,I would not watch it a second time. A pretty lame movie which should have a different title as well.
2,nothing thrilling,waited all along for something ........................ b.. .... ..... ..... .... .... ..... .... ... ... .... ... ... ... ..... ..... ..... ...
1,No Monsters Till the END,"I was looking for Sci-Fi Movie with monsters but got a movie with a lot of talking and almost put me to sleep. Has a very boring story, only the first and last 10 minutes where OK. Not recommended unless you are really bored (Watch infomercials for more action). Very slow movie and boring octopus monsters."
1,"Absolutely horrible alien movie, with no aliens.","This was a sorry attempt at a love movie slash alien flick. They incorporated two lame duck actors (although the chick was semi=attractive) with some octopus' they flaunted as aliens and came up with a catchy name for a title. It should have been titled ""Sucks"" cause this movie did. I had more fun pooping."
1,Buyer Beware....,"I thought this movie had the potential to be a pretty good movie. It is my opinion that you should save your money. If you really want to see it try to rent it somewhere for a $1.00 if you spend more than that, I believe you will be disappointed. Describing the content of this movie can be summed up with one word...""BORING""."
1,What no stars?,Yuck. Low Budget. Low quality in every respect. Amazing how the mating of the monsters justifies the mating of the two humans at the end.
1,Awful movie,"This is not a monster movie. I just wasted 94 minutes of my life on this crap. It's billed ""The Best Monster Movie of the Millennium"". I've seen better movies on Syfy. They took a fairly good idea and made a love/redemption story with a few ""monsters"" in it. Boring. If I could give it -5 stars, I would. Don't waste your time."
1,SOOOOOOO ....... boring,"Misleading title to what COULD have been a good film. It was just so dreary, I cannot honestly think of one redeeming feature. The journalist guy fulfills every bland stereotype ..... always looking for the 'real' story: wherever he lays his hat, that's his home: YAWN YAWN YAWN. As for the female lead, she should have won an award for most irritating laugh/giggle/chortle. Other than that she just pouted, frowned and really just did not contribute anything to the film. Ten minutes into the film my partner and I were eagerly anticipating the two of them being disemboweled and eaten by the 'monsters' (for 'monster' read Kang from The Simpsons); just so that it would be all over and done with and we wouldn't have to suffer their whining voices any longer. Really .... don't bother!!!"
2,UNEVENTFUL!!!!!,"I actually rate this as 1-1/2 stars because it was UNEVENTFUL!!!!! I bought this based on the EDITORIAL REVIEWS from AMAZON.COM along with THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION. I probably will never watch it again. The ending is like they ran over budget, so they just quit filming. Don't BUY it till you RENT it first!!!!!"
1,this movie is a disaster,"I dont know how some people liked this movie?!i dont know if we can call it a movie?!IT IS SUCK. very bad story line, acting, directing, giant illuminated octopus! and endingi dont know how IMDB rated this movie in range of 5! should be 1 or 2."
1,Worse than AVP 2,"dumb dumb dumb. They had no monsters in daylight, no suspense, no real ending, and no plot to speak of. What a waste of a dollar (Redbox)."
1,Not a good movie,"I thought this was going to be a really great Sci Fi movie. But it was how two strangers fall in love after a long trip together to get back to the U.S. Monsters? They only come out at night when you can't really see them, just a bunch of tentacles flailing aroung. Don't buy or even rent this movie it sucked big time."
3,Fare entertainment,"I bought it used om Amazon. It's a good copy and I was pleased with the online service. The movie itself is OK, kind of a si-fi drama."
2,Love Story with Monsters,"Too few monsters...too much love. This misleading title and cover art is a well crafted film but there's little action...lots of love between two strangers...and the plot is extremely thin. Kudos to Scott McNairy and Whitney Able for their acting performances...only 2 stars for the movie because it is in no way a ""monster"" flick. It's a drawn out love story that just so happens to have monsters (they look like inflated carnival parade balloons) in the background. This could have been a great film. It isn't."
3,Movie just so so,"I was really excited to see this movie, but it was not at all what I was hoping for. The dvd was good quality and the extras were fine, but the movie itself was really lacking."
1,flunked geography class,"It is hard to identify the single worst element of this failed romance/action movie. Is it the lack of chemistry between the leads? Its clear that boy will get girl in this movie - but you never believe it is because there is any reason other than hormones. The dude is a player and a looser, the girl is a blank slate with nothing revealed other than boredom with her engagement. The presentation of Mexico is also abysmal. I never knew there were Mayan pyramids within view of the USA border!!!!! Not to mention jungle like conditions right up to the border - so much for the deserts of southern Arizona, New Mexico Texas and even California. It is insulting to have southern Mexico presented as the northern Baja. Just ridiculous."
1,I'm not picky in terms of movies.,I enjoyed a mediocre movie once in a while but this is terrible. Special effects are ridiculously unrealistic. 1/5. Will not recommend.
2,"Yeah, let's get to the action already. LAME","The movie had potential as it was a different outlook on alien movies, but fell flat on its face as it turned into a drama/romance between the two main characters. The beginning was slow, but I figured it'd pick up...It didn't. The middle had a few things in it though mainly provided us with insight that the two characters were beginning to like each other...Really? After watching the ending, I was sorely disappointed and rather happy it was over. If this is your idea of a good movie, you are certainly impressed by anything. The CGI octopi monsters were pretty lame, just sounding like a whale whenever a noise from them was made. If you must see it, just rent so you don't waste a larger amount of money, but your not missing anything at all people. I'm done reviewing now, hope I've been helpful..-Cam"
3,it was ok,I don't know it was ok I guess. I was expecting a little more but it was basically two people talking and not enough monsters. Couldn't identify with the characters or feel sorry for them. Will not watch again.
4,surprised,"As an avowed fan of Marvel movies and fast paced blockbusters, I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. Intrigued might be a better word. Some plot issues were obvious, such as the theft of their passports and money following his night of drunken debauchery. But others, like the night attack on their convoy, and the encounter in the river (who could have imagined that was a 2 seat F16 in the water, and given what we saw of these creatures, how did it get there?) were pure genius, and not something I expected from this movie. Overall, it was very well done."
2,Filmmaking 203,"This movie started with the feel of a friday night chiller movie and instead of developing into something more, it developed into something less. The concept of a quarantine area in the middle of the North American continent was unique and something that could have been developed more fully. The major monsters turn out to be flying squids which lay glowing eggs next to the moss and lichens on the side of tree trunks. When the action gets going, it's hard to tell who's deadlier, the monsters or the combined airforces fighting them. Gas is the preferred weapon.I'm guessing the budget for the film was limited and that in turn impacted the quality of the photography(lighting and color), acting and sets."
4,Fantastic surprise of a film,"I found this movie here on Amazon while looking for more traditional action packed type killer aliens taking over the world kind of movies.This movie has a quiet feel, that focuses much more on the interaction of the main characters with each other, and the people that they encounter on their journey. This movie is NOT an action packed gore fest. I got the impression that it was a much slower pace like ""The Thing"" or the first ""Alien"", though much less frightening. If you love monster movies, but are getting tired of non stop silly action of these new generation PG 13 Horror movies that seem to only satisfy the 14 and under crowd, then try ""Monsters"" for a little more robust ""adult"" suitable monster adventure."
3,The early life of Sam- us Aran.,"Ever wonder what Samus did before the world was infested with tentacle monsters for her to go around blasting? Well this is it. You can watch the early days of Sam as she sports her blond boy cut and bandaged blaster arm as she travels through Mexico with a man that apparently graduated from the Nicholas Cage acting school. Yes, this is the movie we have all been waiting for Metroid fans! I cannot wait for the sequal when Sam finally puts her Gold and Red suit on and takes flight into space to find Mother Brain. Yes! This is the film of the year. Metroid the Other M(Montsters) the movie."
3,Good movie for the buget but could have been so much more,"I think this is a good movie when i first saw the tralier but as i saw the best parts of the moive where in the traliers the rest of the movie is just another love story mixed in with sci-fi, still thinks district 9 is better and can't wait for battle los angelas. Hope they make a sequel but with more alien action invovled with the background that makes the movies intresting not another love story"
3,"Not what I wanted, but good","Continuing with the 'Less is more' concept of films like Blare Witch, Cloverfield, paranormal activity, signs, etc,Monsters gives a lot less visual stimulation then you'd expect in a 'horror/action/suspense' film, as it was advertised. It's basically the story of two people trying to get through Mexico to the US. I'm sure this film canbe debated for hours as to it's 'deeper meanings', but it's overall, a long, hard traveling film where two peopleget to know each other better. Think ofPlanes, Trains and Automobileswith lots people dyeing around them.There is no humor. It's shot with the handheld look of 24, or locked-off cameras, and the monsters are onlyheard (not seen) throughout the first 90% of the film. (The exception being the first 3 seconds).If you liked films likeThere Will Be Blood, then you may like this. I don't think it's a waste of time, but I won't watch it again."
2,Preaching Isn't Story-telling,"As a low-budget science fiction, it could have worked well. Unfortunately, the heavy-handed, politically-correct allegory overwhelms the modest plot. I would like to have given it three stars, because it was quite well made, but I had to demote it to two. If one is to use a tale in service of allegory, it shouldnt feel as though that is only purpose of the story. Just write an editorial instead."
4,A good movie,"Monsters wasn't created as the next blockbusting summer film, as tested by endless test groups with big studio money. Instead it is a small budget movie telling a small story, in the midst of a big event. And that makes it wonderful. The movie is defiantly character driven with the very nice special effects set to compliment the story and not steal it. Now don't get me wrong, there are plenty of political allegories in the film, but they are easy enough to ignore. And you discover the movie itself is quite good, even more so considering the very modest budget. There are things that take away, some scenes seem to last overlong, and some dialog seems to fall flat. This isn't a edge of your seat scary movie either. Anyone expecting that will be sadly disappointed, though it has its scary moments. I think those who watch the movie without any preconceived ideas or expectations will be the ones who will really enjoy this movie."
4,way to go little movie,"wow. just wow. how often do you get a small drama done well without being trite? rarely. How often do you get a monster movie where the the monsters are done well without detracting from the main characters? Not that often. this movie does both, and it does it beautifully. i highly recomend this movie to people who just aren't into monster movies as much i do to those who love them."
2,Confusing writing,"Considered important both for its account of women working in the camps, and as a feministwork since most of the characters are women, surviving and even procreating in the worstpossible circumstances...but I found the writing very confusing--was often unsure ofwho was speaking, whether they were actually doing or only imagining, for instance..."
3,ENERGY,EACH SNIPPET OF THE SONGS I HEARD WERE GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME TO GO OUT AND BUY THE ALBUM. EVERYTHING THIS GUY DID WAS GOOD.I ENJOYED SEEING HIM LIVE AND THE GROOVES ON THIS CD REMIND ME OF THAT.
4,"Fun, but not a great value.","This was a birthday present for my daughter, and since we have made these type of products before, I expected to get a lot of use out of it. This is a great kit if you have not made these products before, or if you don't have the basic ingredients already. Since I have baking soda, oatmeal, European clay, citric acid and salt in my cupboards already (and the kit comes with about $5 worth of these ingredients) and keep essential oils (the oils in the kit are synthetic- maybe $3 worth) the only benefits are the jars and directions. It would be great for a little girl's party, if you get extra jars (the kit comes with maybe four 1 ounce jars and two 4 ounce jars)."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this kit as a Christmas present for my 7 year-old daughter, and was disappointed by it. The components of the kit are every day items that could easily be found in many stocked kitchens, such as baking soda, sea salt and oats, and not much of each. It includes only 3 essential oils (vanilla, coconut, and strawberry). For the price of the kit, I expected much more. I feel like I spent $30 for a few ingredients, most of which I had in my pantry, some small empty jars, and a handful of recipes that I could have easily found on the internet. We had one enjoyable morning, but that was it. It's definitely not worth the money."
4,Spa kit,"This was very easy to use, but you very quickly run out of ingredients. Also some of the recipies need to be adjusted, things come out way to thick or to thin. There is also not enough ingredients to do more than a couple of the redipes in the book. Overall my daughter had a good time with it, we are still looking for more citric acid."
1,Not as expected,"Purchased this product as a Christmas present for my 12-year-old neice who loves sciene experiments. Unforunately, the product did not ship well, and powders and liquids came out of the packaging which made a big mess when opened. We obtained a refund after the product was returned. It was a good idea, but unless the shipping situation is resolved, I would not recommend the product."
4,Excellent service,The package arrived in a timely fashion. The kit itself was not as much fun as we had hoped for our granddaughter.
4,fun.,This item has been a fun time for me and my daughter to do together. we've spent hours together being girlie!
3,So So Spa,"My daughter was disappointed that there were only three scents to work with. She thought the spa part of it was geared towards older kids, but they would not have as much fun with the perfume making. Overall she thought it was ok just not very versatile."
1,Not Compatible w/Toshiba P15,"Our computer power supply died. My husband did a search and found this one which states it is compatible with Toshiba Satellite models P15. WRONG!! The plug that inserts into the computer is not quite long enough to maintain contact and the output is not enough to keep the computer up & running. Long story short, we ordered a new battery, had the computer in the shop for about 3 weeks, and come to find out, we needed another correct power supply!!! DO NOT purchase if you own a Toshiba!!!"
1,AC adapter died after 4 months of infrequent use,"Purchased adapter in January for use on a Toshiba Satellite P25 laptop. I use the laptop infrequently. Yesterday, the charger got really hot, then died. I am less than satisfied.Also, adapter comes with about a 3 foot power cord to the adapter and a 3 foot cord from the adapter to the plug in. This not at all useful and is way too short. I do not remember this being stated in the ad."
5,Best on the market,"For hardly a little more than the cheapie template guide sets you get a very nice one from Porter cable. The nice thing about it is if you have a Porter cable or Makita router you simply slip the guide into the existing hole in your baseplate and secure it with one of the provided nuts. Insert the right sized bit and you are now ready to go to work on whatever guide you need to follow. Much nicer than changing your base out with one of those universal kits , which use three screws to secure the guide to the base. If you need a template guide kit , you can't go wrong with this one."
1,Porter Cable Template Guide Kit,"This kit came with seven different sized guides and two threaded rings to attach the guides to the router's base plate. The guides seem to be sized correctly but the general quality of the guides is rather poor. The pieces are advertised as ""MACHINED"", but are obviously NOT machined as the threads on all the pieces are showing signs of either casting or stamping. While the locking nuts DID thread onto each guide easily, it was discerning to see something with PORTER CABLE'S name on it with such obvious flaws. (...)"
4,Porter Cable Templare Guide Kit,The guides were well made and fit my router perfectly. The only problem I had was that the case was busted when I received it. I would recommend this product. A good value for the price.
2,Not worth money,I'm a huge Porter-Cable fan and I was disappointed in these bushings. I feel that the plastic case they came in was cheap. Also the bushings weren't labeled on the actual bushings just on the plastic container. For the money I would recommend searching somewhere else for guide bushings.
4,PC Template guide,"Not as nice as brass, but functional.Delivered in a timely manner with sufficient packaging."
3,"Good, not great","My local HD (central mass) has just cut the price on this exact set to $5.00!That's pretty hard to pass up.They're not great template guides, but for $5.00, they're certainly good enough to have on hand as backups or for times when you're using more than one router on a project."
4,Helpful Item,I haven't used these yet but I checked out several similar items on the internet and these looked like the best value.
5,The Naked Communist strongly suggested,"I wish I had known about this book when I was in grade school. The information in this well-researched and documented book has really changed the way I view modern history and the spread of Communism. This really should be part of the reading list of all modern history classes in freedom loving countries. Do not be slow-boiled into the Communist plans for our nation, understand the far reaching goals of Communist leaders and the duty to resist them."
5,Everyone who values our country should read this book,This paperback book arrived in very good condition and is one of the most informative books on this subject I have read. The fact that it was written many years ago and is totally relevant today and predicted almost everything that is going on today. A must read for anyone who wants to be truly informed about what is happening in our country today.
2,Need Eye Props. Very dry reading.,"While it is certainly important that we understand where these men ""came from"" and what they intended to accomplish, the book gives many instances of droning third place information. A ""Cliff Notes"" version might be better on neck strain (from drooping). However, if you are looking for many details of who breathed where and when while compiling their communistic reasonings for everything from recreating history to planning the future, here it is."
1,"If you like Glenn Beck, you will love this book","If you are a Glenn Beck fan, then this is probably a great book for you.However, if you actually have even a tiny amount of understanding about current events and history, then this is only good for a laugh. Sadly there are actually people who read this book and believe it. Gullibility has no bounds."
2,I know why it's so cheap,"It took me four days to finally get it up and running, when I first installed the scanner everything seemed to be workong fine. But as I soon learned, the ribbon wire connecting the scanner head had a kink in it which would jam the machine. after repeated calls to Microtek, I was informed that I would have to send it to the company for repairs at my own expense. Customer service stinks. with the help of a screwdriver and some masking tape, (to hold the wire in it's correct position), I was able to get this thing working right. As for scanning film negatives with the optional adapter, save you money, it does a losey job. The software imaging software included disabled all of my pre-installed editing software and reset itself as the default viewer. If I'd known of the trouble that I would have with this product I'd have never bought it. This is the first and last time I will ever buy a Microtek product, customer service is a joke and non-existant."
1,Microtek does not stand behind what they sell- buy beware,"After reading so many reviews now I am disappointed I bought a Mircrotek scanner. The software has a simple mode then a mode with more controlable features. The scanner never responded properly with the more complex mode so I just used the basic. It worked ok until the short warranty ran out. One day I turned it on, scanned one page and poof smoke started pouring out. After inspecting the inside for the cause, I found a transistor had 2 bad solder joints made by the factory that finally oxidized to point of failure and burned out several components. Contacted Microtek by email for parts. They would not sell me any parts but wanted me to spend much money to send them the scanner for repair. They were even too cheap to furnish me with a schematic. A quality company supplies them with the literature when purchased new. Steer clear of a company who cannot stand behind what they peddle."
1,Microtek doesn't work with win2k,"It almost crshes my win2000, each time I use it, I have to unplug the scanner, uninstall the driver, it works for a while. when I try to find the scanner using the tool with the scan software, the computer is stuck. i have got it for free with a laptop purchase, it is still not worth it, i should have choosen a printer instead."
4,Scanmaker 3800 and Mac OS 10.5,"Very good scanner under Windows XP with driver version 5.565 from Microtek Lab website. Though, there's no OS 10.5 Leopard compatible version of the driver to date and have the frustration of having a not fonctionnal scanner with my Mac. I hope that the Leopard driver will come out soon."
3,Reliable and affordable,"I got this scanner as a freebie when I bought a new desktop several years ago, and it continues to perform well for me. There are times when it doesn't seem to want to work, but that seems to due to XP updates - and is generally resolved after a reboot. I have found that every scan needs to be adjusted slighty for contrast balance afterwards, but that's par for the course.It's not the top of the line, so I inclined to cut it some slack - but if you need an inexpensive workhorse, you could do worse."
5,plunge router attachment,"I had an old 690 router that only had a ""D"" handle base. I decided to upgrade the router with the Plunge base. The base fit perfectly and gives new life to the old 690.Good purchase, excellent service from Amazon."
5,Porter Cable # 6931 Plunge Router Base,"This is the first plunge base I have ever used with my Porter Cable #690 router. It's a great combination and is working out very well for me. The plunge base is well made, and it's operation is very smooth and predictable. The fit and finish is that of a quality tool. People who already own the #690 router will find this base to be a good investment, and will be used more than you might think. Sad to see that the base is made in Mexico! It's hard to believe we can't even manufacture a router base in the United States anymore."
4,Porter Cable Plunge Router Base - Very Nice but expensive,"I purchased the 690 router separately a few months ago and now I decided I needed a plunge router capability so I purchased the plunge router base for the 690. The plunge base is very well made and works great. Adjustments are very well thought out, convenient, handy and easy to make. My only recommendation is to buy the plunge base and router together as a kit since then you get the case for it and it's much cheaper. PC charges a premium if you buy things separately. I can't find a case that is sold separately for the combo kit either so if you buy them at different times like I did you are stuck with pieces of a kit rambling around in your shop. The router and parts are very well made but if at all possible save up and buy the router and plunger kit, you won't regret it."
2,Don't get Tangled with this one,"My only hope is that new readers to Anne Stuart don't start with 'Tangled Lies'. Not only did I have everything figured out within the first few pages, there was no climax in this novel. The plot arc just ended up being flat. This novel left me with more questions than answers, and I wish Stuart would have explored each character a little more. The character of Uncle Harris just dropped out out of the book during the middle and never returned.Before you read this book read Anne Stuarts 'Ice' Series, because if you start here I fear you'll never try another one of her books, they are worth the read....just not this one."
4,Get The Horn,"""Get The Horn"" by Gluecifer is the best buy you could make when getting acquainted with this new up and coming European rock band. Their music follows in the steps of great bands like Turbonegro, Backyard Babies and the Hellacopters. Sup Pop has put together this 6 song CD featuring three songs from 2 previous CD releases, available for the first time in the US on this disc. This CD is well worth the price because it introduces you to the band, their sound and what's to come on future Sub Pop releases without offering more songs than can be digested in one sitting. It tells the story of the band in an easy to listen to and easy to absorb offering."
5,"An excellent ""thinking"" book","This is a book for those looking to take some quiet time to think about life, the river, and the environment. It is not a logistical book for those wishing to duplicate the experience. Fletcher's journey reveals the river from the perspective of an elderly man traveling at a slow pace (6 months) who is absorbing the spirit and feel of the Colorado and reflecting upon a lifetime of wilderness travel. It is slow, methodical, and at times a little tedious, but rich in detail and thoughtfulness.This is a book for the thoughtful and reflective, not the pump-me-up, thrill seeker. The little mistakes the author makes are usually pointed out by himself, and they mark the book as authentic in that Colin is a lot like the rest of us in his amateur knowledge of the details of wildlife. He differs, though, in his ability to tell the story, a unique story, of adventure and life."
2,Not Fletcher's best work,"Perhaps I expected too much. I love Colin Fletcher's other books, I think I have read all of them. But somehow he seems to have lost his beautiful and inspiring style of writing. He didn't seem as motivated as on other trips he has written about. Or perhaps it was just a dull trip. Anyway, I had a hard time staying awake. I would recommend his ""The Thousand Mile Summer"" or ""The Man who Walked Through Time"" if you want a treat from the late Mr. Fletcher."
5,This book is almost as good as doing it yourself.,Colin Fletcher's keen eye and attention to detail makes his trip down the entire length of the Colorado River a delightful read. It put me in touch with wilderness adventures that I had enjoyed but long forgotten. This book is a must read for every nature lover
3,"An epic voyage, story full of content, sloppily written","Colin Fletcher has taken an amazing trip and written an amazing story about it. Very inspiring to have done this at the age of 68... But this book was thrown together in a hurry and not well edited. I found myself bogged down by the writing some times. Though I really liked the side themes that Fletcher give us, that add breadth to the story, I wish it were a little tighter."
2,"""Colin Fletcher muses on how great he is (oh, and he runs a river too)""","i have read and enjoyed some of Fletcher's other works, and want very much to run the Colorado myself someday - so this seemed like a perfect read.alas. i found myself so infuriated with his inability to get over himself and his superiority complex that i had to stop reading the book. his refusal to acknowledge the humanity of, or attempt to understand, other human beings was extremely off-putting and really had no place in a book that i thought was about a fantastic adventure.i don't know when Mr. Fletcher soured on humanity, but he was obviously consumed with his disdain for the world when he wrote this book, and just couldn't keep it out of his writings. if you want an optimistic and truly ADVENTUROUS river-running account, read ""Lost in Mongolia"" by Colin Angus."
2,Are we there yet?,"I have to agree with many previous reviewers. This book is slow. I imagine Mr. Fletcher would be very interesting to talk with, perhaps even to tour a river with. However, reading him, his introspective observations become arduous and strained. I put the book down years ago at page 249 and I can't convince myself to pick it up again."
2,Disappointing book; better to read WATER AND SKY,"I had expected the river trip down the Colorado from the headwater would be a great book, but I was very disappointed. A much more interesting book is D. Kesselheim's WATER AND SKY which discusses a canoe trip down the Athabasca river in Canada."
2,A Pedantic Windbag,"I rather enjoyed Mr. Fletcher's earlier books. But his cruise down the Colorado is the essence of tedium, filled with the sort of philosophical meanderings usually found in fortune cookies. He even makes shooting the rapids seem boring -- he has the amazing ability to take an interesting subject, and completely suck the life out of it. Though there are fine moments, overall, I couldn't wait for the trip to end -- I mean, how many times can he talk about the photo he took 40 years ago at a Mexican border crossing? He's a writer who's a bit too in love with the sound of his own voice."
3,Why the long wait to publish?,"I agree that the book is uneven. What's the story behind the story? Why, if he made the trip in 1989 (and the river has changed quite a bit since then) did he and/or his publishers wait so long to publish it?"
2,Does Not Hold Up to The Passage of Time,"This is a fairly old book and it does not hold up well to the passage of time. I would suggest you move one to another book unless the particular plot is something you are really interested in or you want to cover all of the authors work. I would say that the book is as well written as most of his other work, but that characters and plot do not get as much development as his later efforts."
3,Vivitar,"I have ""done"" photography for a few years,and Vivitar,while notNikon,does a Good job with the production of their product.Now Isaw a review 'bout the lens'f-stop,and the rated f-stop of the lens,is the Speed that it allows in light.An f-stop of f.3-f.x ISa heckuva lot faster than say,another Brand w/an f-stop of f.4.The ""other brand"" with the f.4 lens Will be a S-L-O-W-E-R lens than the Vivitar w/an f-stop of f.3. Now rhe ""older"" cameras,ie,Pentax K-1000 SLR has an lens-speed(how fast the lens gathers-inlight) of f.1.8! That was thee Fastest lens on the market,at that time.And w/ TTL(thru the lens(metering))it was a ""killer""camera!Amen. 'nuf said."
1,Ace Photo Digital,"Ace Photo Digital had no intentions of selling me this camera as described. After blowing me off for a few weeks I finally called Ace. They said that they were sorry for the delay and they'd ship it to me tomorrow. Called the next day, spoke to another person. Said they had no intentions of selling me my camera with the tripod, flash, and zoom lens promised, and I should either cancel my order (already the order was late) or just accept the camera. Asked to speak to a manager, one never called. Canceled my order without my authorization. Amazon should have gotten rid of this company, but decided to delete my review instead. DO NOT BUY FROM ACE PHOTO DIGITAL!"
2,Very disappointed....,"I purchased this for my son who was taking a beginning B&W photography class at our local community college. Prior to making the purchase I read reviews from multiple sources and while most had good things to say, quite a few mentioned a faulty/poor light meter system. I made the purchase anyway, hoping to get a good one, but it was not to be. The light meter system is a bit cumbersome already when compared to all of the SLRs I've used through the years, but I can set the exposure on a subject, take a picture, and check the exposure before taking the next shot (same subject) and get a totally different reading just monents later. And I'm not talking one or two F-stops, this thing goes from a 'green light' at F4 at 1/60 to showing overexposed at F22 at 1/2000. It is so unreliable that I had to buy a hand-held light meter just to get my son through the semester. And you can bet this camera will be returned for repair/replacement once his class is complete."
2,Unfortunate thing,"This is a camera made by Cosina, I believe it matches Cosina 1s.The shutter mechanism is kind of OK, but the construction quality is dreadful. It is made of a cheapest possible soft plastic. Even the screw that holds the camera in case is made of soft plastic that desintegrates after a couple film changes. Moreover, the tripod screw mount is made of soft plastic as well, so it desintegrates quickly too."
3,Bases Warp,"I have just circular-filed my third and final D-Handle base for the 691 Series Porter Cable router line. After 15 years of use, the motor body has unfortunately been damaged by the warping bases as well, not to mention the wear on the adjusting pins. While I understand that the 691 is the standard for basic routing, the 691 accessories I have purchased over the years make it that much harder to shop for something new. It is a good investment for a first router, but if you are looking for a serious tool that you can hand down to a son or grandson, try something else."
1,did not work for me,"Tried the many different instructions to program and get working, but would not work for me. The guy selling these was very nice to deal with. He refunded the whole amount I spent on product with shipping to me and shipping back to him. Just wished it had worked for me..Thanks.."
3,NO ORGASM YET????,"I am a college student cursed with this disorder that I keep hearing about older women still not having orgasms. I thought that I'd start early and try to fix it before I go that old. The book had many helpful tips and exercises to pave the path to orgasm. I still have not had my first orgasm yet and I am now somewhat frustrated. The book was a bit out of date, talking about women and how we were raised, but she is right. If you're on the edge of giving up, you might want to try a different book first, but if you're ready to go and motivated, this could be the book for you. Good luck... I know how you feel..."
4,Good book !,"This was a good book to kind of figure out any ""issues"" you might be having. Didn't solve anything but was a good reference type of guide."
3,Good Reading,This book is quite informative and while im not entirely done reading it yet I am learning a lot
2,print too small,"This is a really good book, but I was extremely frustrated with the small print and poor paper quality. I have to have the book just inches away from my eyes to read it, and no, I don't have that problem with other books! If there is another edition that is larger, get it!"
1,The authors need some biology lessons.,"This book is not very clear, and lacks some knowledge of human biology/sexuality that you can get by taking a class. Furthermore, the text is sometimes unclear and overly wordy. There are certainly better books out there on this topic."
2,so far so good,"this book was recommended to me by my physician. I am 25 and have never experienced an orgasm. this book is teaching me that I cannot expect anyone else to know how my body works, what I like. For the first time I am experimenting with mastrubation. I still have not had an orgasm, but I am much more comfortable with my body, self confidant and willing to experiment. I have not yet finished the book, but ""so far so good"""
2,Not worth the purchase for me,"I didn't enjoy the writing style and content included. The stories were cut short just when they could have illustrated a point (I wish the author had continued sharing the story so that I could see if I connect with that person's situation, decision, and outcome). Instead, I found her writing a bit choppy, cutting off before I could benefit from the stories included.The main message seemed to be self stimulation, which I did not anticipate when I was buying the book, so I was a bit disappointed that this seemed to be the only lesson.I also think the material is a little outdated (written in the 70's). There have been several sexual and cultural revolutions since then.It is not worth the hassel to return this book, but given the chance I would not buy it again."
1,Damaged twice,"This item is very detailed and beautiful. It was exactly what I was looking for to put in my pet memorial garden. However, when received the finish was chipped off in several places. I did a return and requested another be sent. When I received the second it was worse than the first. It was at the base and probably would not have been noticed once I put it on the ground, but I was concerned it would get worse outside in the weather and eventually all the finish would come off. I was very disappointed."
1,Poor packaging means this arrives broken,"I ordered this for a friends birthday - when it arrived, it was broken. I reordered it, and the 2nd one arrived even MORE broken!!! I think the manufacture is to blame due to the poor packaging. The statue is cute, but not very sturdy. I will look for another one that is a bit more solid."
4,"Love it, but...","I love this St Francis and the animals portrayed, however, I was disappointed in the finish resilience. It is not very strong against the weather elements and the finish chips. The material underneath is pure white which makes the chips very noticeable. I will have to repaint."
5,wonderful present,I purchased this for my Mother's birthday after looking far and wide for a nice St.Francis that was not too expensive or large. They like to store their garden items for the winter so this was a nice weight and size for them to handle on their own. The color was very rustic looking and the detail was wonderful.
3,Broken on arrival,"The statue is beautiful - I just wish it had come through intact. It was extremely poorly packaged; the box was literally falling apart upon arrival. It came UPS, but I believe the warehouse was just as responsible for the damage. One piece of tape on the bottom was not enough to hold the bottom securely. I would suggest that somehow the statue is looked at before the package is accepted. It was very disappointing."
5,St. Francis Statue,"Loved the statue that I purchased as a Christmas gift for my daughter. Only disappointing thing was that I ordered two, one for each of my daughters, and just received one. Then they were out of stock and it's still on backorder. My other daughter liked it too so having it shipped to her when it arrives."
2,To Small,These containers were a lot of money and when I got them they were just to small for anything useful. Plus the covers are really difficult to get on. Right now they are just collecting dust.
1,Not happy...it was a gift and receipent is very disappointed,this was a gift for my daughter and she was very please to receive it. had some alligment problems when attempting to use adaptor for here Nano. very dispointed. currently its useable and making attempts to get some correction to the problem.
4,I-Pod Speakers,These little speakers work great and are very convenient for traveling. Pretty good sound and a great way to share I-Pod music with my husband
5,Great for portable use,"I have had a previous version of this device for a while. I've been very happy with it except for the fact that it eats batteries when left powered on. This version fixes that problem. My wife and I like to fall asleep with podcasts playing on our iPod. The iPod will power down when finished with a playlist. We cue up a few while we are camping and then listen just like at home. The old version of this device would stay powered after the iPod was done playing. This used up our batteries way too fast. The new version will go to sleep when the audio is completed. No more dead batteries. Thanks for the fix! We leave the old one by the bed at home now since it can be powered by AC. This one stays in our ""ready-to-go kit"" for traveling. We are happy campers!"
3,Michael Raines,"Overall the Porter cable 8620 12 volt battery pack is mediocre at best. The contacts on the pack corrode quite frequently, causing costly downtime to clean them up, and one of the units in the set of two failed only days after the warranty expired. On a positive note, the one hour charging time was a plus, and the flashlight-drill combo worked very well. I would have given it a 5 star rating, despite the contact problem, until the unit failed prematurely. (In my opinion). I used the tools only periodically when power was unavailable or awkward to get to...it is certainly not going to break the bank, but a disappointment to fail so quickly."
2,12V Battery PAK Model 8620,"My first battery lasted only 2 months before it became corroded while left in the cordless drill and almost ruined the drill. I since learned to remove the pak after each use. This is an ongoing problem with the pack itself. I spend more time cleaning the contacts then I do using the drill. Secondly, I cannot find a store that sells placement packs, which I find very inconvinent. This has been my first experience with a Porter Cable product. I purchased this item based on rave reviews in Newsday (Long Island newspaper). While NOT disappointed with the performance of this item, I am disappointed with the lack of available service and replacement parts."
5,Batteries for an old Porter Cable drill,"I like my old 12v Porter Cable drill. But, the batteries were having a hard time keeping a charge. So, it's time for new batteries. The new batteries should hold me for another 5 years."
3,"From Austin, Texas, Formerly Known as Bubble Puppy","From the late 60's to early 70's, central Texas had a remarkable feast of music from so many bands. Bubble Puppy was one. Their popularity was fierce in those days. BP was actually one of the first rock bands to feature two lead players (Rod Prince and Todd Potter). Their big hit was a psychedelic piece called ""Hot Smoke and Sassafrass."" However, maybe one of the most definitive musician's anthems (and clearly overlooked) was that of ""Todd's Tune"" which was redone on this record and sounds better than on ""A Gathering of Promises"", Bubble Puppy's first record. The band came to Los Angeles to record. I'm not certain why they changed their name to Demian. The effort was there but the recording did not render the band's virtuosities and energy I remember as a teen growing up during that exciting period in Austin-San Antonio Texas rock music. This group was one of the bands who helped generate the Austin music scene."
3,the son of bubble puppy,"this is bubble puppy under another name. the album's not as good as bubble puppy , but the version of todd's tune is, i think, considerably better. face the crowd is a zeppelinesque gem, love people is a decent mellow number, and windy city is a good cut with some fine socially conscious lyrics. it is a better produced recording than a gathering of promises, but the songs just aren't as memorable. fans of bubble puppy, ""zeppelin- type rock: and steppenwolf (nick st. nicholas produced this album) will probably enjoy this album."
1,WARNING!! BAD PRODUCT. UNSAFE,"SHOULD BE TITLED ""TOILET UNSAFETY FRAME"". ARMS ARE EXTREMELY WOBBLY. ARMS CANNOT SAFELY HOLD WEIGHT. BAD DESIGN. DO NOT BUY!!1"
1,Warning - Safety Issue,"I bought this item on 9/24/11 via Amazon site for $45.98 for our use, both in our eighties. Received a few day later. Installed by professional maintenance. Immediately apparent that the arms wobbled so much that it was unsafe for us to use. Immediately dismantled, repacked in original box. Vendor notified within 48 hours. Requested return authorization as product so unsafe, among other things. Vendor denied return, cited fine print regarding no return of these products once opened. How does one know if product defective without opening?!! Note that on current website product has been considerably reduced after my complaint. I'm disputing the charge. This is a product with arms that wobble so much it is unsafe for us. In our opinion a shoddy, dangerous, item that should never be sold to seniors. Had I known this, I would never have bought this product. I'll certainly be very wary of anything this vendor sells in the future."
4,East India Company Raj,This book gives an insight into the ideas that sustained British Rule in eighteenth and nineteenth century India
5,Reviewing Asoka,"It was the first time that I was watching a foreign movie from India, and my reaction was definitely a positive one. This is a great movie about the life of Asoka. I recommend this movie for the entire family because it shows the story from different points of view, and also the songs, the coreography and the argument of the story were very descriptive."
3,Compelling but inaccurate retelling of Asoka's life,"An epic drama that weaves horrific scene battles with vigorous dances on melodious songs and breathtaking shots of fog-clad green hills, Asoka is an expensive historical epic that betrays historical truth at almost every turn. This should matter little to Bollywood fans or Westerners looking for a pretext to brush up their knowledge of Indian history. They might learn little accurate information about the historical figure of Asoka the Great, the conflicted ruler who was responsible for the transformation of Buddhism into a major world religion, but still come away with the feeling of having spent their time well after viewing this drama."
2,"A boring love story, that's all!","I got this film with high expectations. The first 10 minutes were great, then there was 1-1/2 hours of boring love story, followed by 40 minutes of thumb twiddling while Asoka recovers from a wound, then a few minutes of plot followed by one of the dullest battle scenes I've ever seen. Lovely cinematography, appealing musical numbers, but a boring story. Rent, don't buy. I am so disappointed!"
5,"Violence, love, peace, war, armies and royal families.","A 150 minutes of humor, battles, blood covered swords and pretty females dancing. Musical numbers, lovely landscapes, strong themes about peace, war, good and evil. Following the development of Asoka from big mouth, spoiled, Prince to married man, then from warlord to man of peace is amazing and really pulls you into the film. Nice extras, including a couple of behind the scenes featurettes."
5,Third on my 2001 list....,"Santosh Sivan's newest feature is a beautifully stylized and executed film that is going to change the way the international public views Hindi films. The film explores the life of Emporer Asoka, from his early naive days to his accepting of Buddhism. In the middle is his quest for power, and how he would even kill people to become the winner of a violent war. Shahrukh Khan is brilliant as Asoka; he embodies all characteristics of the man, and such a role is not easy to play. Kudos as well to Kareena Kapoor, who easily turns in an award worthy performance. The real star here though is Sivan's masterful camerawork. Excellent music by Anu Malik. International version runs thirty minutes short, minus most of the songs. Played at the Toronto and Venice Film Festivals."
4,Beautiful,i really liked this movie. the musical bits were funny and sweet. it has a good story behind it. of course if you're into the older films then you might not like all the special effects and modern twists...but i enjoyed it very much. i've seen it over 20 times and i recommend anyone to watch it.
3,Skip it if you're interested in Asoka the Buddhist,"This is a movie about the Indian ruler Asoka, a significant figure in the history of Buddhism. As is apparently typical of Indian movies, ""Asoka"" is longer than your average Hollywood movie and includes lots of musical numbers.I rented the video hoping it would be an entertaining way to learn a little more about Buddhist history, so I was disappointed that the movie ends with the bloody conquest that led to Asoka's embrace of Buddhist ideals. Like another reviewer, I want to see ""Asoka, Part Two."""
1,"why bollywood, why?","i wasn't sure if this was a historical drama or a soap opera or a music video, it may have been equal parts each and fully terrible"
2,Asoka,"The beginning starts out a bit cheesy and seems almost home-made. Asoka's whip and the fight moves were a bit lame, but that's the action. The film was about love, the effects of imperialism, and union. The movie itself was not great, it shocked many viewers and did not meet high standards. The only real cool thing about the movie was that there really was THAT many elephants and warriors and horses."
2,Inauthentic,I was disappointed by this movie. The dancing was so Bollywoody and inauthentic. The whole movie with its singing and dancing does a disservice to the subject. Awful.
3,Stylistic movie,"Santosh Sivan's stunning cinematography does not work in this film. This is a highly stylized version of Asoka, the Indian emperor or king, who is responsible for spreading Buddhism outside India. Asoka was an ambitious king, who underwent a fundamental transformation after he converted to Buddhism. He switched from an ambitious king, to a peace-loving and kind king. At least this is what you read in history books.This film is based on the life of Asoka, but fails to do justice. One of the reasons could be that Shah Rukh Khan was probably not the right person to be cast in this role. He somehow did not fit the picture. The film was disappointing, and a tad too long for me. I can sit through 3 hours of a regular Indian film, but had problems sitting throught this film. Somehow the film failed to grab my attention. I think somehow the real meat of the story got lost in the stylized translation of the story."
3,HAVE THEY MADE ASOKA PART TWO YET?,"we need today to see the tale of his conversion to his mission of peace rather than genocide.That is the message we need now as we drown in the blood red song and dance of genocidal imperial war. The emperor converts and fights with peace for peace.Now, that would be a movie!And it really happened five thousand years ago? Where have we been? Which way did we go? Please, show us the rest of the story!"
3,Fun and Silly,"One of the students in my art history class suggested this one when we studied Indian art. It's definately not a relevant historical documentary...it's pretty much a pop musical (can't really say its Bollywood, but maybe it is). I still show it to my students and they always remember the wagon wheel and his conversion to Buddhism as a result...and they have fun!"
1,Horrible,This movie was just plain horrible! There was no historical accuracy and barely any fight scene (no that expect many from a Bollywood film). Kareena Kapoor was terrible and spent most of the movie doused in water like a wet rat. Do yourself a favor and save the three hours of your life you'll never get back for something more useful.
2,A disappointment,"This has to be one of the biggest disappointments I have ever seen. The first half of the movie was extended too long and made me want to fast-forward to an interesting scene. The second half was better, though. The film wasn't necessarily bad, just much too overhyped. Unfortunately, the film did not include the greatest period of Asoka's life. There are some good songs, however. Don't have high expectations when (if) you watch ""Asoka,"" or you will feel disappointment as I have."
1,Not worth $5.95,This is pretty much a worthless little book in my opinion. It includes all of 47 recipes--six of which are for drinks. I love strawgerries but I could only see about two recipes that I might consider trying. I was very disappointed.
4,Excellent value,"For a basic model this is an excellent bargain. This is easy to install, easy to operate, easy to read."
2,Worked fine -- until it didn't.,"I had one of these for years, which worked fine until I was working on my handlebars, accidentally yanked the cord too much and it stopped working. The way this one works, there's a ""base unit"" that the computer slides into (a nice feature, so that you can have one base unit per bike, and switch the computer back and forth, allowing you to record ""bike 1"" and ""bike 2"" with one computer). So decided to just get a spare ""base unit"". Unfortunately, that never really worked. Bought another whole system, and that didn't work, either. So now I have two of them, both of which only function as a clock. Kind of disappointing, because I really did like the first one I had."
4,Great,"I read the negative reviews but I have never had any of those problems with this computer. It's worked well for me for several months, including through the winter, although on really cold days it didn't work. I think the battery was too cold because once it warmed up it worked fine again. The only bad thing I can say about it is the way it attaches to its base on the bike could be better designed. I've accidentally knocked it off a few times when turning sharp and had to turn around and look for it. It has hit the asphalt a couple times and still works fine, though."
4,Sigma bc906,"All functions work fine on my unit.The one issue I have is that the sensor needs to be very close to the spokes magnet and there is nothing provided in the package to help you shorten the distance between the two, if needed. I had to rig it with a piece of wood placed behind the sensor so it would get close enough to the magnet; the guy who uploaded one of the photos did it wrong - you have to place it at the spokes near the tire rim, not the hub, and set your speedometer to your tire size so the unit can calculate correctly distance and speed after each revolution."
3,"mostly great, some problems","this thing works well, it is pretty easy to install.my problem has been that the parts frequently come off of my bike or slide out of place.i was in a fifty mile ride last weekend, and it stopped working on mile 30 - i couldn't get it back in place and i couldn't measure mph or anything for the rest of the ride."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!,U have to have a degree from MIT to install this JUNK!! and then it still wont work DO NOT BUY!!!
3,Track car speedo,"I have a small track car (Lotus 7) that does not have a working speedometer. The transmission itself does not have an exit port for the cable. The Sigma speedo was epoxied in place, the cable was lengthened and now it is ready to be used.SIGMA BC906 9-Function Topline Wired Bicycle Speedometer"
5,zero issues,"I've been using these on my hybrid and on my road bike for about a year now. Rough roads, rain, dropped unit -it just keeps working. I highly recommend this if you want a dependable wired computer."
4,Bike computer BC906,"The good. Easily readable display, quick and simple setup.Could be better. Speed resolution is 0.5 mph. Uphill, at low speeds higher resolution would be good.I'd like to see the trip time and trip length on the same screen. If you want to see the other, then you end up paging through all modes before you return to the original page."
5,Excellent after purchase support,The speedometer was very easy to install and set up. I did have a problem getting the remote sensor magnet to communicate with the computer so I called the toll free support phone number. I talked to Bryan who helped me figure out what the problem was and how to correct it. Problem solved and the speedometer is working great. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a bike speedometer
2,Unfortunatley dissatisfied,"I recently purchased a concord reference Bible and was excited to receive it in the mail until I found several problems with it. The binding, upon which Canbridge prides itself, was already beginning to crease on the spine after the first careful opening. The Title on the cover was printed slightly crooked and the logo on the leather cover (spine area) was blured. I may have gotten a lemon among the may good ones, but it was nevertheless disappointing. I will be returning it for a refund. A Bible that costs so much should be better quality. I will try the next one up in quality."
4,Invaluable book for teachers who want their students to problem solve or are looking for puzzles to enliven class & build logic,"If you teach Math and want to help your students come upwith creative strategies to solve problems, this isan invaluable book. It will give you tons of ideasthat will make math more engagingThe drawback -- the price. That is why 4 stars, not 5.I bought the old edition to give to a friend who is a Math specialistand that was cheap, cheap, so no problem.If you can find a cheap, older editions, do that.But if you don't, don't let the price deter you --if you're a teachereither ask your school to order one orbreak out the school stationery and ask for a review copy.Whatever you do, look at this book at some point."
3,ok seat,"This seat is narrow, which is good if space is an issue. The center buckle (crotch area) is too close to the body, so it's difficult to close with bulky clothing on. The Britax Regent has a lot more space. If your child is thin, or you live in a warm climate, then the seat will work."
5,Radian65,"Awesome! This seat fits perfect!I drive a Toyota RAV4 and will have three kids in the back seat, two in boosters and soon a baby in this one!! This seat requires just as much room reclining as any other convertible seat or even infant car seat. The base is narrower than on other seats. Took about 10-20 minutes to set up and install. The instructions were really easy to follow. I would definitely recommend it!!!!"
2,"Great seat, but very difficult to install safely without LATCH.","We bought two of these seats for our kids after much research. They are very solidly built, durable, and I believe they are very safe when used properly. The problem is installation. Our cars don't have LATCH systems and it is next to impossible to install these securely with the shoulder belt. I typically have to wrestle with each one for 20-40 minutes, often injuring my back and fingers to get them securely into our '92 Accord. Using the tether helps but it's very difficult to get the the shoulder/lap belt tight enough to minimize play, even using the locking clips.They simply will not fit safely in our '93 Corolla. Even the LATCH installations can be quite difficult in the rental cars we've used. The straps can also be quite difficult to adjust--they seem to get stuck underneath. I would love to give these a much higher rating but installation is so difficult that it can seriously compromise safety, not to mention usability."
4,Needed a skinny seat,I needed to fit 3 car seats across in my van. This seat is one of the skinniest available. The only problem is that it is so heavy! If you are leaving it in the car permanently than that won't be a problem though. But if you are switching it from one car to another or expecting it to be easily carried you should be warned. Otherwise the seat is just what I needed.
4,Good seat,It's a neat seat. I have them side by side and the wife sits back there also. I wish the top was a little bit narrower. This seat is more than 20 lbs. it's heavy
3,Comment about aircraft safety,"Most airlines I am familiar with, will NOT allow you to use a folding car seat during takeoff and landing, regardless if the seat is FAA approved. Has anyone had this experience?"
1,Buckle defective - it breaks!,"Just like an earlier reviewer, the one prong of the chest buckle on my son's Radian 65 carseat snapped off when I was putting him in the car today. The seat is only about 1.5 years old, and we are the original owners. Clearly, the plastic is not high quality, and cannot withstand routine use. I shudder to think what might have happened had it been tested in an accident. Sunshine Kids should recall the product instead of hiding behind a one-year warranty. Buyers beware!"
4,Great seat! (If it fits!),"I was thrilled to find a seat that I could use for my 4 year old! I felt very uneasy about putting her in a booster, because, even though it's legal, it's NOT as safe as a harness!! The fact that this seat is so narrow is a great thing for me because I drive a very small car and need to save room where I can! I have had great customer service from sunshine kids reguarding this seat. My emails have been returned promtly and my question have all been answered.I will say that I only gave it 4 stars because I have not been able to install it in every car I have tried. So please be sure you buy from somewhere you can return it, just in case!"
2,One HUGE flaw,"Yes the folding feature is handy for people who travel on planes to grandpa's house... but it is heavy, and you have to buy an additional strap to carry it like a back pack.Also, THE COVERS ARE NOT MACHINE WASHABLE!! What kind of child's product isn't machine washable?!? Our one year old vomited old milk all over the car seat, and no amount of hand washing was going to get the smell of sour milk out, so we threw it in the wash... and it practically disintegrated. A replacement cover is $70.00! So instead I sewed it back together Frankenstein style, not very attractive, but it's working... sorta...If the cover were washable, I would recommend this car seat... but without, I'd say keep looking."
4,This is a real good car seat.,"We bought the Sunshine Kids Radian 80 last year for our oldest son. We really liked that one. We decided to get the Radian 65 this time around for our second son to save a little money. We have two more kids that will be growing into these two car seats. Yes, they are heavy, but it's not the end of the world. I am 8 months pregnant and just had to move both of the SunShine Kids car seats by myself into my mother's car. It was fine, not a big deal. The straps are real nice, they don't twist. Both of my boys, ages 5 and 4 can completely strap themselves in and get themselves out, which is very much needed. I feel like I am offering my kids the most safety I can with these car seats, for a very long time. I think it is super important to keep my kids (any kids for that matter) in a five point harness for as long as possible."
3,This thing weighs a ton!,"My toddler seems very comfortable in this car seat, and it's wonderful that it folds up - great for storage. But as far as taking this on an airplane for travel - no way. This car seat weighs a ton and is very uncomfortable to carry."
5,Best Childrens' Book Ever,"The Chicken Book is a beautifully illustrated classic tale of animal mothers and babies, in this case, chickens on the farm. Children and babies of all ages find this book captivating, both for the pastoral beauty of the full color watercolors as well as the simple, succinct text.Little ones love identifying the butterflies, bumblebees, ponds, barns, cows, horses, plows and haystacks, hens and chicks, worms, et cetera, in this wonderful book. Toddlers will enjoy the text. Even Dads seem to enjoy reading this one to the kids.Buy in hardcover, as you'll want to save this one for the grandchildren. A perfect baby gift for enlightened parents who read to their children from Day One. Can be hard to find at times and may be out of print.A timeless treasure!"
5,Love this bra!,"I am a 34D and often have difficulty finding a bra that provides adequate support and comfort at the same time. I have spent all kinds of money experimenting with different styles and brands only to be disappointed. This bra provides both comfort and support, and it looks good as well. I can run, do aerobics and kickboxing, or just wear it for everyday use. I would prefer a little more support for some of the exercises I do that include a lot of jumping, however I am still happy with it. Ultimately, it has become my favorite. I have washed it several times and put it through the dryer and its still held its shape well. Although, I have started air drying it to make it last longer."
3,"Not Maximum support, but medium.","Description on the item reads: ""provides maximum support and comfort during intense activity "" However when I got it the tag said 'medium support' great for yoga, pilates etc. I'm a runner. It looked just like a sports bra I had and needed to replace, but not the high impact support I needed for my DD girl.It's good for a jog, but not for a hard run. A bit misleading!"
1,Not for me,Nice fit but the plastic thread used to sew together is exposed. This will rub a whole under your arms when running. I returned.
3,Comfortable but not what was advertised,"I read a review before purchasing this sports bra that said the purchaser got the wrong item delivered. I decided to try it anyway for the price and unfortunately the other reviewer was right. This bra is NOT a high impact bra, the tag says medium impact for walking and yoga type activities. I ride horses and was looking for a high impact sports bra with an underwire, they are hard to find in the larger sizes for a reasonable price. I will keep this one as a barn chore bra, but will have to continue the search for a riding one. Also, for me the sizes ran a little small, I ordered my normal bra size and it feels a size smaller."
4,Lots of support and comfy,"I am borderline D cup and this bra in a 36/38C/D works better than I had hoped it would. I've tried on about dozen sport bras over the last month or so and this one works but it isn't the best, its certainly something that anyone on a budget can afford though so I'll give Champion that. The only thing that I wished it had was adjustable straps. Ive washed it a few times and it hasn't fallen apart."
4,Champion Medium Control Sports Bra,"This is a fairly comfortable bra. I usually buy a size 37 C and I got a 37-38 CD in this bra which is still a bit tight. Like all my back hook bras, unfortunately I can feel the hooks. Why can't someone design better hooks or a decent fastener in front? It offers medium control-- not for running, etc., but it looks nice and smooth under T-shirts."
2,Not the same,"This bra (at least the style number) was my favorite sports bra. I ordered by the style number off of my old ones, however there has been a major change in this bra. It does not support well during running and Zumba and I do not wear it at all. Very disappointed."
1,Who puts that much elastic in a high impact bra?,"Grrr. This goes into the category of should have known better. I have enormous boobs, and the Champions have never worked. On this bra, the cups were smaller than expected. But what surprised me was that every bit of the bra was stretchy. That means that even with a smaller than needed cup, my junk was flying around everywhere. Colossal fail.Exercise care, ladies, because when I sent this thing back, Amazon assessed a 50% restocking fee... which they graciously and quickly refunded... but it required my catching it and making the call."
4,does the job,"I have worn twice while working out so far - gets more comfortable each time, the underwire takes a bit of adjusting, but I am sure I will get used to it."
2,No Support,"I ordered this one because I love the support of the Champion Powerback, but hate having to pull it over my head to get on and off. I was hoping this one would offer the same support, but be easier to wear. No such luck. Both versions fit well in a 34DD, but this one just doesn't have any support in the cups because they are too stretchy."
5,Great product,"Fantastic item, very supportive! Great for those needing a quality bra for light to moderate exercise. Will definitely use and recommend this he's in the future."
1,Beware - Listing is incorrect!,"I needed a new sports bra for running.I am not flat chested, so i was looking for support, specifically for HIGH IMPACT activity.What a disappointment when i open my package and the tag reads:MEDIUM IMPACT ACTIVITIESWalking, Pilates, YogaMedium SupportI like the bra, it feels good and i may keep it, BUT the point is:DONT TELL ME I'M GETTING A HIGH IMPACT BRA WHEN REALLY YOU ARE SENDING A MEDIUM IMPACT BRA.Not cool Amazon.=("
2,"Love Champion bras, but not this one.","I'm a big woman who can go into any store and try on all the bras, yet not find one that's comfortable and supportive. Champion is the only bra I'll wear. I like this model, it's the only underwire I've ever worn and forgotten I'm wearing it, but it's not built as solid as I am, and a strap broke after I'd had it fewer than 30 days.Champion, if you're listening, please retool this one to be as sturdy as the rest. Thicker straps in the back, and stitch those straps so they'd survive a hurricane."
2,A little too cheap for me,"Yes its an edge guide, but geese PC couldn't you have made this a little nicer than you did? This guide works, but the casting is so rough ( and flimsy ) that it makes it hard to run the router smoothly along your work's edge. It really is that bad. Compared to the BOSCH edge guide the PC is marginal at best. I modified mine with a phenolic ( polyethelene ) material cut to the same size as the guides, and used 3M double sided structural tape between the phenolic "" glides "" and the PC guides, and it works much better. Come on PC, I know you sell enough of the 690 series routers and accessories to justify some improvement."
1,About as primitive as you can get.,"Instead of a PC product, this is more like a dirt cheap sand casting from a 3rd world country. The ""machining"" is just as crude to boot. For instance, the guide rods are not even parallel in both the vertical and horizontal planes. And those cheap thumbscrews need pliers to keep the thing from slipping. I like the router it goes on, but this thing is a complete waste of money."
4,Retired,"Good tool and good value, would buy again. Only problem is that the two screws holding guide to roter can wokd close and the guide could move while using, suggest that you check the screws each time before using"
4,excellent film,"I bought this dvd for the kids and i got quite into it,it's a lot better than the first which i had seen on tv 1 christmas. There where funny bits, sad bits and a happy ending the kids love it they watched the film 4 times a week for a month they know the songs off by heart. I thought it was a good idea to keep all the original characters in it but they also managed to introduce some new ones, which add to the plot so i wont go on too much. If u liked the first this is a must and oh did i forget to mention the kids love it as well."
2,Urgh....,"I have to tell you, I had big hopes for this movie. Really. But it didn't make it. Here's why:1: Sasha is SUCH an annoying character (No offense to Sheena Easton, who did a wonderful job voicing her). She constantly rags on Charlie, and then, without warning, decides that she ""loves"" him (It won't last, though. Trust me, I've seen the tv series), leaving you with an ""Eh?"" sort of feeling. Besides, what ever happened to Flo, from the first movie?2: Charlie is not himself. I fell in love with the con-artist-with-a-soft-heart from the first movie, not the whiny, boyish smart-aleck in the second. Burt Reynolds gave Charlie a wonderful depth--Charlie Sheen does not.3: Carface...is...stupid.4: The bad guy is a joke. He's all artificial evil. No real scariness whatsoever.5: The animation and coloring stinks.6: Ichy's turned from being the selfish, yet sympathetic friend to a goody-two-shoes scaredy-cat7: David."
1,All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 is NOT for christians!,"It's clearly said, All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 is NOT for christians! I'm glad we only watched, not buy! In this, bad can happen in Heaven and there is no adventure in Heaven. There is a place for adventure in Heaven, and why did Charlie say there's no adventure if in this bad can happen in heaven? And Charlie chooses earth instead of heaven. I like Itchy or whatever because he LOVES heaven. While watching I sadly said, ""It will have an unhappy ending!"" and it did, Charlie choosing earth when heaven was an option. If you are a christian, don't buy this - it is against God. Signed, StoryMaker. ""Gotta trust the kid's review!"""
4,Great guide - but NOT FOR the 890 Series PC router,Somewhere on the Amazon website I read that this guide would fit the 890... It will once I drill and tap a couple of new holes... Caveat Emptor!
2,Just a commercial,"I am a little disappointed in this book. It seems to just rattle on at times with bits of useful information added in. The useful information is then directed to the sponsors in the back of the book. The book often refers to experts who have no references. I'm sure that the information may be accurate, but these things that I have pointed out make me wonder."
3,"New Book, Same Old Information","The problem with this book is it is superfluous. The material you really need is already contained in Reid's book The Tao of Health,Sex & Longevity, which is Reid's masterpiece. That book and Guarding the Three Treasures are Reid's best books and the ones that you purchase."
5,The best detox book I have read.,I got interested in detoxing the body from a friend of mine who let me borrow this book. After I read the first chapter I decided to order my own copy of the book. It is packed full of detox methods ranging from fasting to tapping energy meridians to detox massage and more. A must-read for anyone interested in peak health or traditional chinese medicine.
4,An endearing and believable story,"I just finished this book and I must say it was an immense joy to read. The rating it TRULY needs is more like 4.5 stars.I enjoyed it mostly because the plot was most realistic and it was possible to happen not only that but the characters themselves were well developed with a three deminsional history to go with them. This is the best choice of Evans Porter books to read if this is your first of this author.The only thing that I felt was lacking was the ending. (Chapter 29 prior to epilogue) The story was well developed and the ending was good, but when I got to the last page, it seemed that it needed the slightest kick to give it more power."
5,A Great Microwave,"This microwave is easy to understand, no need to get out the manual every time you have a frozen dinner requesting you cook it half way at 50%. The buttons for Pizza, Beverage & Dinner Plate are perfect and so is your food and beverage every time, perfect temp. I haven't tried the other ones yet. Compared to the microwave I just got rid of (because it was sparking inside, and old, so it was time for it to go) this microwave just is so very different, as I said before it gets the temps on anything just right. I would recommend this to a friend or family member!"
4,Review of this Combo,I am contractor and bought this combo about one year ago. I use the drill every day. It is the best cordless drill I have every used. The clutch setting are great once you learn were to set them for your application. The saw is also a great tool to have on any job. I use it mainly for cut offs on roofs or light finishing work because of its light weight. I do find that the saw will bind or stall if feed to quickly. One thing that would make this kit better would be to add a third battery. Many times I am using the saw and drill on the same job and need a fresh battery. This is one place DeWalt could improve this kit.
4,Stairway to heaven,interesting and fascinating all at the same time. The photos werewonderful and the text was clear. Highly recommend for both the browser and the reader
1,Give me a break,"With the well known clerical errors in computing their investment returns, why would anyone waste any time, not to mention money, on these ""unlucky"" ladies advice.Try instead, any book by Larry Swedroe, John Bowen, William Bernstein, or Charles Ellis."
4,"Some actors are from Argentina, but it is done in Spain","Very well done and well acted.A little morbid and somewhat depressing (how can a good peson live and spend whole life in jail), but a great movie."
3,NOT A BAD CD,REALLY ITS NOT THAT BAD OF A CD THERE ARE COUPLE BAD SONGS BUT THE ONES THAT ARE GOOD R BUMPIN IF YOU R A TRUE THREE SIX MAFIA FAN YOU WILL LIKE THIS CD
3,TNA Bloodiest Brawls Review,"While not a bad dvd,all of the matches in the disc are pretty hardcore and good reminders of the 1990'S ECW but it's not as good as the 2003 video which the infamous Wednesday Bloody Wednesday wargames match which was a grade a plus reminder of NWA'S wargames from the 80's and every other match on that 2 disc set. Somebody please tell how to get THAT set instead. Anyway, I give Scars & Stitches a 7 out of 10."
5,A Beautiful & Dark Masterpiece,"A movie that time forgot, a box-office failure that became a television classic. This is one of the darker movies from Frank Capra, who was a dark artist. Dealing with depression, repression, suicide, love, hope and sacrifice, it is a very profound look at family life. It goes into the depths of darkness, which makes the light that much brighter. It pulls no punches, and earns the emotional and cathartic ending."
5,christmas present,made mom very happy. its great to sit down and enjoy a classic like this with family or friends. the story is still gripping even years later. recommend to anyone wanting to watch a good clean classic family type movie.
3,"Beautiful sound, mediocre singing","This is a stunning DVD (with a different cast) to watch where the sets and costumes tend to distract one from the ordinary singing and acting. On SACD, the experience is not so rewarding. Albert Dohmen, Doris Soffel, and the Walkuren sing beautifully and certainly know what they are about in their roles. Linda Watson delivers a good Ho-yo-to-ho, but is otherwise shrill and unsteady. She may well be effective onstage, but here her virtues are negated by not being able to see her. Charlotte Margiono is an adequate Sieglinde, but is unmemorable and John keyes, whatever his physical attributes, is a very wobbly Siegmund. Kurt Rydl also has a wobble, but he is effective nonetheless. Hanchen claims to be using the new Wagner edition and maybe he is, but either he or the stage director, Pierre Audis, ignore Wagner's directions for Sieginde and Brunnhilde to shriek at scored moments in the drama. Good sound. No libretto."
3,I can't find any reasons to buy it without SACD.,"There are many excellent Walkure recordings we have to buy. But, it is not one of them. I can't find any reasons to spend money except that it's hybrid SACD."
3,I didn't enjoy this book as much as I wanted to,"While the premise for this story was wonderful, something about it just seemed disjointed for me. It didn't flow or have the continuity that usually keeps me entertained. I can't quite pinpoint why. Maybe more background information on some of the characters would have appealed to me more? Maybe understanding more of the back plot? I never leave a book unfinished but I found myself plugging along on this for a while just trying to get to the end. Frost does paint a great historical picture of England though, I will say, but it wasn't one of my favorite books."
4,Doyle's adventure into mystery.,"This will be the second time I have read this enjoyable book. The story involves Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as the main character in a role that can only be described as ""Watson."" Thrust into the mystery, Doyle meets many people along the way but his companion in this story is his ""Holmes."" Doyle must deal with mystics, evil cults & murderous assasins. Mr. Frost does a wonderful job of bringing you straight into the story and quickly into the action. Bringing in the other literaries of the time (Bram Stoker & Mary Shelley) makes this story even more interesting. Full of adventure and mystery, I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone who likes a good ""Holmsian"" book and/or someone who likes a good adventure/mystery."
4,good reading,"i thought it was ok, the conan doyle dude was kind of a sissy and was lucky he had some people who knew what they were doing around him. frost used a lot of big fancy words."
5,the game's afoot!,"This is a classic fantasy thriller that features Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes as the hero! Doyle with the aid of a Holmeslike sleuth names Jack Sparks must match wits with a band of criminals trying to take over England by supernatural means. This novel combines thrills, chills, humor and a little romance it also has one dandy of a final line."
5,Best Book I Have Ever Read,I could not help myself from writing this brief reveiw. All I can say is that Mark Frost and the List of 7 is the best book I have ever read. It is a must read.
5,Thrilling,"The List of 7 is the best beach book I have ever read. I finished the it years ago, having bought it because the creepy cover hooked me, and have been recommending it since. Please take the time to read this marvelous, thrilling adventure story; I'm sure you will enjoy it."
2,What a Waste,"Take the book,The 7 Percent Solution, and mix it in with the film, Young Sherlock Holmes, add a pinch of The Mummy, and you have this book. It's not a bad book, I mean, Frost clearly can write, and you won't feel that you have wasted your money. It delivers what it sets out to do: historical mystery/thriller/horror story, etc., etc. It's just so dang derivative that there is no incentive to seek out anything else by this writer. If you want the adventure/horror thrills, get the 2 movies mentioned above. If you want a Sherlock Holmes pastiche, read Nicholas Meyer's book. Or better yet, if you want the REAL Sherlock Holmes, read the real thing. They are still very fun books, especially the Hound of the Baskervilles."
3,Merely decent,"I picked this book up in an airport and decided to give it a try. After all, I was a big fan of ""Twin Peaks"" and decided that anyone who wrote such a gripping whodunnit (at least, the mini-series and early into the series) might create fascinating characters for this novel. Not quite. Don't get me wrong, I liked the characters, but there weren't the quirks that I was expecting, the truly mesmerizing characters who made you really want to know more about them. Perhaps all that was David Lynch's contribution.Regardless, ""The List of Seven"" was a fairly good read. I didn't feel cheated, but I don't know that I would give it to a friend with instructions to read it. It does plainly set up the sequel (which I have not read).In the final analysis, I find there is a reason why I hadn't heard of this little book, printed first in 1993, until the summer of 2005. It's entertaining but unremarkable."
2,What would A.C.Doyle think?,"I started this story because I was amused by the concept of turning A.C.Doyle into a fictional character. Sort of completes the circle started by fan's insistant belief that his creation Holmes was a real person. (Also I'll read anything about Holmes, no matter how outragous) Unfortunately the plot in this story lagged, Jack Sparks is a wonderfully drawn charcter, but as soon as he was offstage I was bored, and skimming ahead."
4,A good read,"This was an excellent book, and a twist, having Conan Doyle and Jack Sparks be the adventurers-and inspiring the creation of Sherlock Holmes. We also get a glimpse of the future in the eyes of a little Ausrian baby...overall, very entertaining"
3,Rollicking story with a flat ending,"The List of 7 is great airplane/beach reading. The action is nonstop and hugely entertaining, as a young Arthur Conan Doyle finds himself caught up in a conspiracy theory with occult overtones. Each of the individual set pieces are quite imaginative. I am not surprised to discover that this is a first novel, though. The ending is curiously flat, with a number of intriguing plot threads wrapped up perfunctorily and a final revelation that I found more groan-worthy than shocking. Still, this is a promising debut and well worth the read when mind candy is called for.Addendum: the reason for the dangling plot threads became apparent to me today when I saw the sequel in the bookstore. As I can't decide whether to increase my rating to reflect this or decrease it in disgust at the new trend of publishers hiding the fact that novels aren't stand-alones, I'll leave it be."
5,Still great stuff!,"I got this book as a bookseller's advance back in '94, and loved it. While a bit derivitive on the ""Sherlock Holmes"" genre (and what's wrong with that?), the ripping yarn aspect carries all the authority needed to grab the reader and pull them along.Several years ago, I started writing a ""Vicorian Fantasy"", and as I re-read this book, I realzed that I had been unconsciously copying it in my manuscript. The ""List of 7"" had occupied a part of my mind where I kept the idea of good adventure. It's that good."
3,An enjoyable but unnecessarily difficult read,"I wanted to like this book the entire time that I spent reading it. But there were stumbling blocks the whole way. The characters, while likeable, were not really fleshed out as real people. The dialogue was stilted but with fun and erudite banter. In desciptive passages, I got the feeling that Frost had the thesaurus and simile dictionary a little too close by at all times. The book is a moody trip to the dark corners of Victorian England that keeps you guessing. I did enjoy it and had some wicked nightmares as well. But it wasn't worth the time to plod throught Frost's thick prose."
4,Good but not so good ending,"The book is gripping and very suspenseful throughout, but the ending is a little flat and not what you expect. I enjoyed it but warn readers not to expect closure by the end."
2,Author is verbose. It was a struggle.,"Seems to me that Mark Frost wrote this book for himself, not for the average readers. Too many words to write a single thought, I am not impressed by the string of words he puts together. Mark did pretty well with the Grand Slam and Greatest Game Ever Played but reading this book had been a struggle to say the least. Before buying this book, go to the local library and read the first chapter. If you think you can handle Mark's style of writing, buy the book then."
3,too detailed,"I like historical fiction and this one had it's moments but overall the length of detail slowed it down and the ending seemed rush and ""pat"". I like the alienist series better."
4,An accessory that shouldn't ...,"...be an accessory.I bought my first Porter-Cable router when my trusty 25+ y.o. Craftsman finally bit the dust. I figured routers were pretty simple devices and they are all generally the same; the same bits that fit my Craftsman would fit the Porter-Cable. Wrong. I tried to use a 3/4"" round-over bit. The bit would not fit the hole in the stock base plate. I (and a lot of others) couldn't believe Porter-Cable would make their classic router without the capability to accept any non-pro grade bit. I had two different sized collets so why not two base plates?This thing is clear, made in Mexico, fits the router perfectly and allows you to use a full range of bits. Yes, you can make one if you want or buy this one and wonder why it wasn't included in the first place. For that I knocked off a star."
2,Good Phone for a While,This WAS a good phone for a while so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. It was clear and had good range. The intercom feature was nice. About 9 months after purchase though the screens on some of the handsets started to lose pixels. Eventually some screens were almost totaly blank and others were half blank. Then there was nothing to do but recycle the batteries and throw the rest in the garbage. I was very disappointed. Don't make the same mistake. I hope my new Panasonic system lasts longer than this one did.
4,Awesome water pill,No more bloating during PMS! I also like to take it a few days in advance when I need to squeeze into something tight. But drink lots of water or you'll get light headed.
5,They work but...,"They work quite well but I was nervous about taking 3 at once so I take 1 with breakfast, 1 with lunch, and 1 with dinner."
4,Aquadrene has worked great for me,"This diuretic product has been the best one I have ever taken that is non-prescription. I take it for PMS, it really helps with water retention during that time."
1,Doesn't work,"You get 60 capsules but you have to take 3 of them twice a day so essentially, it's a 10 day program/supply. The bottle says nothing about the duration of time you need to take it to achieve effects but I did the 10 day ""program"" and I feel just as bloated as I did before I started. It may work differently on everyone but for me, it came down to paying over $2 a day for pills that didn't do what they claimed.Also, many other reviewers claim that the product works BECAUSE it makes them go #1 a lot but the directions instruct you to take the pills with a large glass of water and to drink AT LEAST 8 glasses of water throughout the day so if this is more water than you normally consume; yes, you will be running to the bathroom more often than normal."
5,Great water pill,I am usually very skeptical on taking water pill products but I really needed to lose the water weight I gain during my monthly water retention period. It worked effectively almost immediately.
1,Terrible,"Thought this would help with water retention, and it did nothing. Not worth taking those horse size pills every morning."
3,okay....,this was okay. it got me into the mode for losing weight i lost like 5 lbs of water weight so it kinda encouraged me!
4,No more bloating....luv it!,I have the tendancy to bloat easily just before my period. I really like Aquadrene in comparison to other water retention relief products. This one is definately by far the most effective.
5,Damb Good Router & Company,"I am far from a pro but I do demand performance and quality. The store salesperson had not opened the new 7518 box yet and when I asked why not his reply was ""I'm afraid to look as I would have to take one home for myself"". This is a quality machine and it shows.Please don't go try a craftsman... UG! I've done that which is why I went top drawer this time. Tools are meant to last a lifetime and this is a proud machine to own. What a beautiful soft start to this powerhouse !Nice Job Porter-Cable"
5,Power beast,Great router for mounting in a table. It has the different speeds which works great if using larger bits. It's the best for the money and I'm glad I bought it.
3,It stalls,"This is an exelent Router until you get into the 3 1/2"" raised panel bits. I bought this router because of its power and Porter Cable Reputation. It stalls out out on hoging cuts forcing me to turn the router off then back on to continue the cut. It happend to me 20 times while cutting 19 raised panels. It is supposed to preform well even under the most demanding routing cuts according to the MFG. Porter Cable has replaced it but the replacement does the same thing. To make it work I take around 8 passes or go so slow I burn the wood black which is workable with a baby step cut as the last pass. Cutting the rails & styles of the doors in 1 pass it works well but so did my 80.00 dollar Craftsman 1 3/4 HP that was made in China. I am very dissapointed, may have to go to a Millwakee 3 1/2 HP."
5,Porter-Cable 7518 Speedmatic 15 Amp 3-1/4 HP Fixed Base 5-Speed Router,A workhorse and maybe more than you need - IMHO - really meant for a production type environment and not the home user
5,"Heavy, Solid, Powerful","The router is heavy, powerful, and solid. If you need this kind of power, you are probably going to use it is a table mounted situation anyway, so the weight really isn't such a problem. This router should have all the power you will ever want.Getting the bit's in and out and loosening and tightening the base for adjustment can put a world of hurt on your hands. It is expensive too (You might look elsewhere if you are going to use this on just one project).Even with the little nags, this is one of the prize tools in my collection."
5,"""THE PORTER CABLE HULK""","This is a monster of a router and is truely in a class by itself. I agree with most other reviewers, that it is outstanding when it comes to sheer power and precision. It should last a lifetime with proper care and maintenance. No other routers can compare when it comes to the beefiness of this bad boy. Some users complain that lacks certain features, but keeping it simple is what makes it a no frills powerhouse. Definitely a 5***** rating!"
4,Switch needs work,This is a good router and works best in router tables. The problem I have with it is the switch. Keep it clean! It clogs with lots of use. Just blow it out regularly and there should not be a problem.
5,Porter-Cable 7518 Speedmatic 15 Amp 3-1/4 Horsepower Fixed Base 5-Speed Router,"The slow start is a safety feature. Any maladjustment can be detected before the thing gets going too fast. Like any other fine tool, you have to keep it clean, so the blades are set properly. The height adjustment is stable and easy. I replaced the router base with a 10"" by 10"" see-through 3/4-inch plastic base for more stability, especially for during slot cutting, where any change of plane mis-places the slot and hence the spline, hence the alignment of the boards. The machine is powerful and smooth. I bought it because my friend -- something of a genius in cabinet-making and in almost all other areas -- swore by it. He was right."
2,Don't use this router for Raised Panel Cutters,"I bought this router thinking that it would have no problem cutting raised panels based on PC description of the product. When I received the router I tried cutting raised panels in red oak with a 3 1/2"" panel cutter, the router stalled and had to be reset. I thought something was wrong with it so I called PC and they sent me a new one. It did the same thing. You'll have to take at least 4 passes and even then chance burning the wood if you use this router. It worked great on all other bits except the large panel raiser, which is why I bought it. I could've spent a whole lot less for a router to use with my smaller bits. When I contacted PC about the problem they informed me that that was the design of the router circuitry to stall if too much load was applied. Having to take 4 passes in red oak is a bit excessive. I've had the router for 2 years and ready to throw it in the drawer and not use it."
4,with minor fix - a good value,"Instead of just adding a lock washer next to the knob, add a star washer inside the joint created by the stand and the music holder (remove the bolt, put the washer between the bridle joint of the stand and the bottom of the music holder and thread the bolt back through to engage the knob) This makes for a much stronger angle adjustment."
3,Okay for sheet mucis but not for even the smallest of books.,"The price was right so I got one. Does the trick for the beginner or for sheets of music. Books don't do so well and prove to be top heavy most of the time, even some smaller ones. Strictly for practice."
5,very well-designed,"This music stand folds up, but all the parts & pieces stay together w/ hinges, so you don't have the problem of dropping pieces or the bookrest part getting knocked off the stand part. I didn't realize this when I ordered it, and it is a pleasant surprise. In general, sturdier than i expected."
1,It is too cheap to use - My daughter hated this.,Better buy something strong - this can not hold her binder and she hated this.Now I have a piece of metal that I can't use.
3,good enough,"it's exactly what i wanted - a cheap, folding, beginnerss music stand BUT it come bent - spend a little bit more and get something sturdier"
3,OK,OK for a low priced add-on to my drum-set. Not very stable and do not try to put a thick music book on it.
2,Not the greatest stand,"I purchased this stand for my daughter to practice her instrument at home. The clamp to keep the top part of the stand upright which holds the music does not tighten enough to keep the music from tipping over backwards. Therefore, we have to prop the stand again a wall to keep the music from falling off backwards. Needless to say, I am disappointed with this purchase."
5,Great!,"The music stand was just what I was looking for, I used it for my student's recital and it worked out perfect! Thanks!"
4,music stand,"Brand new in package, received quickly and works great. Would definitely use seller again. Seems that you can't tighten top enough to keep it upright to hold a book of music."
5,Great value!,"I purchased this about a year ago for my daughter. She was just starting out in band and I didnt want to spend a ton of money on a stand that she may or may not use very long. This stand is great! It is made well and has been used a lot and still looks as good as new! For the cheap price I paid, it is definitely a great value. We fold and unfold it often to keep it put away neatly when not in use and all the movable parts are still working great. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a simply yet cheap music stand."
5,inexpensive and does the trick,"i needed a simple music stand to hold my music and notes when practicing in my room. this does the trick just fine. it is light, sort of cheap, etc., but it does what it needs to and it did not cost me an arm and a leg. I wouldnt recommend using it for concert or stage performances but for at home, practicing, it is just fine."
4,good for what it's made for,"My ten-year old son has found the stand great for light-weight music books. It does sometimes fold, however, when he puts heavy books on it. Since most music books are thin, we haven't found that to be a major problem."
1,Made in China...,"As usual, made in China means a very cheap version for something you expect to last more than the very first time, at least that is my experience. Cheap means expensive considering you have to get a new one after a research for better quality item. Don't waste your money in this awful and useless thing."
3,On stage with Amazon,It serves its purpose very well. It does a good job of holding my music - thank you Amazon. It's black which goes with my decor.
3,"Good stand, Wobbly","The stand is easy to set up and takes no effort. The only problem is that when it is properly placed, the stand gets loose and wobbly."
4,Good bang for your buck,I have two kids who started instruments this year. As they are young (9) and we aren't sure if they will commit past the first year I didn't want to spend a fortune on a stand. This is a good quality stand for its price. I am sure it isn't professional quality per se but as a novice I have had no problems with it. I love how collapsible it is (and easily at that)
3,"Good Music Stand, a Little Short","This product is functional and sleek-looking, complete with those small silver wires that hold sheet music in place. It is quick to fold up and pack away. The only problem I have with this stand is its height, which is rather short. I have it resting on the box it came in now, and even with those added five inches, it is still short. Otherwise, it's a good music stand, honestly represented."
3,Cheap... just like the price. But good enough for me.,I just needed something to hold my music while I practice. This thing is flimsy as hell but good enough for holding some light pages. And it's so inexpensive and ships free with Prime. Good enough for now.
1,Great for featherweights,"It's really a shame. This is a nice looking stand that opens and closes easily. The maker skimped on the most important part, the clutch. This would probably work for a while if you were only holding a few pieces of paper at time, but a music book of any sort will collapse it. It's possible that some of these are made better than others, but the one I got was a dud."
4,How to fix the one major flaw,"OK, so you wonder how the design engineer(s) on this thing could make such a mistake. As many others have noted, the tightening bolt/wing-nut on the rack tilt joint cannot be torqued to the point where it will hold much of anything. There should obviously be tiny grooves or something similar on the mating surfaces to create some friction.To fix this, I cut a small circular washer out of some scrap soft plastic (from an old ball or innertube). Once that is included in the joint, you can tighten it down and it will hold just fine.Aside from this silly omission, the stand works great and is a very good value."
2,Aggravating,"The stand is fairly stable, but the locking mechanisms are plastic, and the retaining clips are short and lightweight. The main problem, however, is the clutch. It fails with all but the lightest of books. With some difficulty I managed to insert a lock washer between the stand shaft and the bracket, but with very marginal success. The tilt concept is quaint, but the production and execution are poor.I managed to get a second lock washer on the other side of the post. It holds better, but not great; and I don't hold out much hope for the future."
1,poor hardware sheet music holder,The wing nut that is supposed to hold rack that holds the music does not grab and rack falls back.
1,Package of 3 ???,The description clearly states package of 3. There are 15 per clip. This would make a total of 45. hansonent4 sent a package of 2 for a total of 30 tips. You do the math. Recommend this vendor. No way.The actual postage paid by hansonent4 was $1.39 USPS. Take a look how much they charge!
3,"Good, but far from ""complete""","Color me naive, but I would think that any book billing it self as a ""Complete"" Jewish songbook would have a range of melodies spanning the centuries. its pages would have not only Shabbat songs, but classic songs for all the holidays, as well as well-known Yiddish and Hebrew folksongs. Well, this book doesn't have that. Most of the 350 songs in here are new, and are variations on Shabbat songs only. They are great for someone playing instruments in a synagogue, but not so great for introducing the classics to your kids at home. We are returning our copy."
5,Excellent,"This book is great ! It has everything that I needed, and it arrived in a timely manner. Thanks !!"
5,Wow!,"This was definately a great book for people all ages, but more towards young adults. It's about Laurel Shade trying to find out about the newcomers, the Holyfeilds, and why they chopped down the neighborhood's favorite tree. While doing so, she befriends the new girl and has a secret liking for her brother. The end is a twist, so don't be tricked!"
2,Doesn't explain things!,"Reading this book, you will often cry ""But WHY? ...Why does that follow from the axioms?""In short, this book explains WHAT relativity says, but it's very buggy in explaining the REASONING behind those statements.Some statements simply aren't explained well.I was disappointed.Maybe I am too stupid though."
5,I think it was great,I think that Martin Gardener explained the theory of relativity very well sa that everyone could anderstand.
4,History with a point of view,"This book makes the point that America's policy toward Israel has a long historical background, partly based on religious attitudes and partly on the holocaust. Very well done, the book presents historical information--some of which was new to me--in clear language.A good read."
5,Too much math education can cripple,"Non-math books, such as this one, should be required reading for all physics majors in college. Too many highly educated individuals know all the math but don't understand the conceptual workings of physics. For instance, during my morning coffee break with two of my friends (one a professor who teaches college level physics, the other an electrical consulting engineer in the semi-conductor field) couldn't grasp the role that quantum entanglement played in the fact that an electrical current can't flow between the positive pole of one battery, and the negative pole of a ""disconnected"" second battery.Many men and women who are too highly educated to bother reading this book, desperately need to read it."
3,Arjona simply the best,"The only reason for buying this CD is Arjona. Out of all the songs only the three that are from him are worth the money. But these three songs are the best, like all Arjona's songs. With this CD you can notice that Arjona, different from all the other singers in this CD, would never be considered like old or out of fashion, because these three songs written like a decade ago are still fabulous. I put only three stars, one for each song of Arjona."
1,old tracks,"This cd is a compilation of tracks from diferent(sometimes outdated) singers. It was put together most likely to make some money of Arjona's fame. I think that the three or four tracks that are really his, are from before he made ""Animal Nocturno"" his first CD. Arjona has improved with age. If you want to know his music buy ""Historias"" and ""Si el norte fuera el sur"" they represent Arjona's mood at their best."
2,Does not cut straight,"I bought this saw because I really like my DeWalt cordless drill. Unfortunately, I have been very unhappy with this product. But only for one reason, albeit important for a jigsaw.The blade chuck does not stay straight. Once the blade is secured in the chuck, it can still rotate. To cut a straight line, I have to hold the saw at an angle. When you twist it back to turn a corner, the blade chuck moves so you can't cut accurately.I am past the point of return/ exchange, and newer models supposedly don't have this problem, but I thought this would be helpful for anyone looking at this saw on the used market."

3,crazed psychopath tortures girl,"This sadistic slight novel might be just your thing, but don't expect entertainment on the level of the same author's DIVA.I read and enjoyed DIVA by the same author. Years later, I picked up LUNA expecting a similar experience.The beautiful and precocious teenager Alba is kidnapped by a psychiatrist and his patient. They whisk her away to a rural estate to participate in their gruesome and hideous entomological fantasies. Alba's partner Gorodish must find her and save her from the bad guys.The plot is appealing at times, but sometimes it plods forward deliberately. The resolution all but writes itself. The book is almost a short story, at approximately 100 pages. There is very little of the character development of the novel DIVA. At its worst, LUNA seems like a series of statements that one might use to describe scenes in an action novel.I would recommend this novel only to a reader who has enjoyed all of Delacorta's other novels about Alba & Gorodish.Ken Miller"
4,"really an incredible singer, beautiful, clear, high voice.","A wide variety of songs, some great for dancing, others are so haunting. a wonderful artist."
5,Great hooks for my Rogar pot rack.,"I had to search to find these supplementary hooks - as I hang a lot more items on my Rogar racks than the 6 hooks that come with them. Anyway, they are great and do the job. Superior to other pot racks and hooks."
5,"classy, intelligent and what a voice!","The previous viewer is sure right in saying, ""the biggest voice in Spain."" Rocio Jurado has a huge voice and she knows how to use it. For me this is strange music. I was not sure to make of it. Most of the arrangements are for strings only wiht flamenco hand-clap-like percussion. Over this, Rocio blasts out flamenco like melodies so grand that it borders on opera. Shades of Carmen! Some might find it slightly corny, but if you give it a fair listen, you will find that it's solid, tasteful, and beautifully sung."
1,Another Work of Llewellyn Puiblisher's Fiction...,"This book really deserves ZERO STARS. One more attempt to pass of Wicca and Wicca-derived spirituality and methods as Celtic Paganism. I've got news for those considering buying this book: 1) Wicca IS NOT Celtic Paganism! and 2) This book is NOT about Celtic Paganism in any way, shape or form, except for some of the cute myths and names included to try and make it sounds authentic. If you really want to learn about Celtic religion, try Alexei Kondratiev's ""The Apple Branch"" or Erynn Laurie's ""Circle of Stones"". If you want Wiccan fluff dressed up in kilt and celtic knots, then by all means buy this book."
1,A Horrible Monstrosity,"It is horrible that so much crap is being published today due to such unscruplous authors who dont know anything about what they are writing about. This book is Wicca with Celtic flavorings, and why have 'celtic' flavored Wicca when you could have the real thing?As a person of Scottish origins it saddens me to see others be sucked into this ignorent old mans lies.It also saddens me to see so many people contributing to the COMPLEATE AND UTTER LIE that Wicca is of Celtic origins, which it is of course not. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK-and study the facts first."
1,Without a doubt debatable origin of Fact or Fiction,To the laymen who is gullible to those who would say it is wrong but would provide no right but only another question. But for those who would only seek the truth about their want of knowledge as to those who really don't know. Those hmmmmm keep looking for that needle in the hay.
2,No real history here.,Sorry Mr. Buckland. I have been to Scotland and inspected many stones inscribed by the Picts and I didn't see any of your swirl type alphabet on any of them. This book does contains a lot of information about Wicca but very little on Scottish history that is accurate. You can't make something that is not Wicca into Wicca and that's what it looks like you tried to do in this book. It was entertaining to read but not very factual.
2,"Usual ""lore"" with a slant","Folk customs and traditions portrayed as some ilk of devil worship.This kind of thought is what got midwives and wise women (and their cats) murdered as witches.Kill the cats, the rats flourish, and you have bubonic plague rampant."
2,Make-believe,"As usual Buckland has taken liberties with the truth. He claims to get a lot of his information from someone of whom there is no record, there are far better books out there and better information on the many Scottish websites."
5,Whatever It Takes,It is a book for everyone. WHATEVER IT TAKES is a great read for whoever you are and wherever you are in your life. Why haven't I see it coming ? Love it.
5,Whatever It Takes,This book really inspired me. I couldn't put it down and dog-eared almost every page.
2,A meager hiking guide for a great state,"The 'Hiking Michigan' guidebook was ok, but I expected more. The book is adequate for casual walking. Unfortunately, the maps were not well done. Both the trail maps and the directions to the trailheads lacked important detail. The guidebook did not have a summary matrix of trail information that would have been helpful in planning outings. On the positive side, the descriptions of the trails were accurate. In addition, the book includes introductory sections on clothing, equipment, and trail ethics. Therefore, 'Hiking Michigan' is a good starter-book for the novice, but it falls short compared to true hiking guides."
5,Funny movie!,"Brando is absolutely charming and hilarious in this dark comedy and the writing is first-rate. The cinematography of the woods and country is breathtaking and you really get a sense of this ""small town"" from the script and acting. Sheen and Church are fabulous in their parts although Sheen sometimes speaks a little fast in some of the comic punchlines, so seeing it more than once would be of benefit. The twin girls are lovely and cute and I daresay we may see more of them in future films."
1,Brando Goes Straight to Video,"If you thought ""A Countess From Hong Kong"" was a low point in the Marlon Brando filmography, wait until you stumble upon this made-in-Canada turkey. A disastrous black comedy, ""Free Money"" (1998) proved unfit for theatrical consumption and received a straight-to-video burial. Brando's final starring role as an orange-haired prison warden is a grotesque embarrassment in a cinematic apocalypse all its own."
1,See it if its Free,"If you are a Brando fan like me you have probably wanted to see this movie, but had trouble finding it, or did not want to buy it. Worry no longer it is a total waste of time. I believe it is heading in the direction of a dark comedy, but it falls well short. The plot is stupid, the characters are stall and sometimes annoying, and it is simply not funny. Brando has taken questionable roles before, but this one really leaves me shaking my head. He is the best actor in the world, yet he does all these bad movies. Oh yeah, if you are a Charlie Sheen fan you will also want to pass on this because this is CHARLES Sheen, not Charlie. The new Charles is even worse than he alter ego, Charlie. I give this movie one star just because Brando is in it."
2,NOT THE ELIZABETH THORNTON I KNOW AND LOVE,"Okay. I know I'm in the minority but, Ms. Thornton's republication of this 1990 book was not a good idea as far as I'm concerned. Scarlet Angel was also written in 1990 and is a much better book. Anything she has written in the last seven or so years is a much better book. Had someone handed me this with the cover torn off, I would not have recognized it as an Elizabeth Thornton book. First you have the ""hero"" who is physical with our heroine and feels he has to protect (translation: control) her for her own good. . .wow. This one is dated. This one will not join my other Thornton books on my keeper shelf. Try any of her other books or try Leslie LaFoy's trilogy. Much better investment."
2,Scary!,"I gave the book two stars for it's well written and easy follow. But...the abuse Annabelle accepts is too much for me. She's supposedly independent. Why didn't she sell out her 1/2 of the company and open one of her own? She paid for the diaries out of her personal money so was free to do with as she pleased. Wasn't able to accept that portion of the story, nor the very graphic pre-jail scene. How about the scene where he is choking her? Although I know how much of that went on/goes on, and unfortunately still does in certain countries, I still find it too much."
3,I like historical romance,"I love books that take you back to a different time but since they are written now, you always get a story with modern views on life. I find it interesting and Elizabeth Thornton is one of the best!"
4,History adds to character learning,"This book provides historical, cultural and meaning-based context for learning simplified characters. It gives a good introduction to a variety of radicals and a large number of characters. The approach would suit learners with an academic disposition. The book suggests it be used as a stand-alone course for learning characters without learning their pronunciation. No doubt this would suit some learners but I would personally find it very hard to learn that way. Instead I am using it to reinforce and expand a course where character and pronunciation are taught simultaneously. In this context I find it very good, even exciting in the extra dimension it offers."
4,Good solid performance,"This is a good studio album of Rory's from the early 1970's. He is a polished guitar player, and this album allows that skill to shine through. However, if you're not a serious collector, skip it and buy the new double-cd he has out now."
1,wrong type of mat,The mat was the wrong style. They sent me the cheap looking diamond plated mat. The picture does give a true idea of the mat.
2,TASTES AWFUL !!!,This is the worst tasting product ever. It smells like death. We have to hold our five year-old down kicking and screaming to give her a teaspoon. try the lemon-lime flavor. It is better.
1,Can't get my kid to take it.,"This stuff smells awful and tastes worse. I can't get a single dose into my child, and I'm not willing to hold him down kicking and screaming. I won't take it - why should he? He's already got enough sensory issues to deal with that this is just torture. Terrible product!"
2,A guilty pleasure...,"This movie is so bad its good. The story is stilted, and not at all complicated. The acting is over the top and the costumes are dreadful. It is however lovely to look at, and might as well be a travel guide to Barcelona, Spain. Made in the early nineties, you can tell, but it didn't hurt to watch. True it can't even see the good movies from where it's standing but you can glimpse a young Kate who is light years from her Underworld character."
3,Decent movie,"Just watched this movie on DVD. The main attraction of this movie is obviously the beautiful Kate Beckinsale. If you don't like Kate Beckinsale (hard to imagine) then this movie will be a drag. Otherwise, this movie is a decent enough movie with a plot and cast that will keep you interested. I am giving it three stars since I like both Kate Beckinsale and Art Malik."
2,"Disappointing, though Beckinsale fans might find it worthwhile","This movie was made in the mid 1990s in Spain, it was directed by Jim McBride, based on a novel by Perez Reverte, and it stars a young Kate Beckinsale. Sounds promising? The movie's not. Basically, the plot has Beckinsale (with a boyish short hair cut) playing an art student in Barcelona, who finds that a flemish painting holds clues to some murder, or something. The whole thing is very dull, full with ridiculous situations and characters. The only thing to recommend for it is a couple of nude scenes by the young Kete (one in particular, with Kate topless for many seconds looking at a painting and sporting a grannie's panties is particularly memorable)."
2,Not at all good,"The motivations of the characters were all over the place. Perhaps it's a ""Spanish thing"", but the male characters in particular are boorish and whiney in an instant - it's all....""I'll get you, you b***ch"" one minute and then all lovey dovey with the same female character in the next scene - as if nothing dramatic had happened - you know, like attempted rape for instance.It's a sad day to see a great actress like Sinead Cussack having to utter the, ""You need to get laid"" line and use the f-word a lot. Very sad indeed.Also, the ""plot""? Oh dear. Obvious is too obvious a word to use.And as for the ""selling point"" of the DVD, the lovely Ms Beckinsale is a way more attractive and interesting in the recently released ""Underworld"" - here she just looks too young for the part. I'm reminded of the song ""Jailbait"" by Motorhead.All in all, I'd say.....avoid this one."
1,ONLY FOR CHESS GAME LOVERS!,"THIS MOVIE WAS VERY BORING!IF YOU LIKE TO PLAY CHESS-YOU'LL LIKE THIS MOVIE.THIS IS A MYSTERY BASED ON BEING SOLVED BY FINDING CHESS PEICES,AND THEIR CLUES."
4,A nice murder mystery,"I must agree with the first two reviews. This is an interesting little murder mystery with the fetching Ms. Beckinsale as an art restorer caught up in a centuries old murder mystery based on a painting. Only problem is, someone in the here and now is using that same painting to do some murders of their own.It's a light and breezy kind of amateur sleuth flick. You could do a lot worse, and if you're a fan of Kate Beckinsale, you'll enjoy this film. Except perhaps for Kate's unshaved armpits (the film is set in Europe). And yes, there are some scenes of Kate ""uncovered""."
3,A good chess mystery,"The movie isn't bad, but it's lacking something. It is quite an old film (1992) but it looks older, it has an 80s feel to it, the colors aren't sharp, as many European films were until recently. The copy is not the best either and the DVD comes with no extra features. The story is good and Kate Beckinsale offers a good early performance. I cannot help but compare it to the cinematic adaptation of another Perez-Reverte novel, The Ninth Gate, and there is where this one falls short. Still it's entertaining and surprising as a good mystery should be, and if you are a Kate Beckinsale fan, you will be glad that she is in almost every scene."
2,Uncovered,"While restoring an old painting showing a woman and two men playing chess, Julia discovers the text ""Who killed the knight"" underneath the paint. The owner of the painting tells her that one of his forefathers was killed, the painting might identify the murderer. When Julia's friend is killed she understands that there is more to it. She consults Domenec, a chess genius who reconstructs the game from the painting. With any piece he takes, somebody dies. This movie is a very poor translation from the novel. If you enjoy laughing over a miserable attempt to make a mystery, then by all means, rent this one. B-movie at best, not Kates best, predictable."
4,Turned out good.,I like this dvd. Turned out to have a good story line. Was expecting it to be a B movie. I also liked Kate in all her glory. She was and still is gorgeous.
3,Beckinsales so HOT,Well i guess its an interesting storyline and any movie that shows kates boobs gets an extra star JUST for that. So its a 2 star and an extra for kate being SO fine. Kinda like whiteout. whiteouts like a 2 star movie but it gets 4 stars just for the shower scene
2,Pretentious and boring... Avoid...,The problem with movie's reviews is that there is always someone to say a lot of very good things about even the most stupid and disappointing films... I have myself been a victim of that several times... Never buy a movie just because someone here wrote good things about it... Try to read what TIMEOUT for example says about the film...
3,A rip off,"Compared to the other seasons of Def Poetry, this DVD set is a rip off. It costs more, but there are only 6 episodes. In past seasons, they've managed to fit 6 episodes on one DVD, so I'm guessing that the only reason they split the season in to two discs was to make it seem like there's more content than there actually is.Still, the performances during this season were incredible as always."
4,A Great Book--with exceptions,"I found this book to be the best that I have read of McDonough's (I have read three of his, besides this one). His description of conditions preceding the campaign were fantastic. I also found that McDonough treated Bragg fairly--unlike many other historians. Although I wish the accounts of the battles had been longer, the ones there were terrific.On the other hand, I found the few maps too be not enough, and the ones provided were not too good. A nice compliment to the book were the several photos of the battlefields (Richmond, Munfordville, and Perryville).Overall, I believe this book is worth the $12.57, plus shipping. I actually bought my copy elsewhere, at the full price of $17.98. Just the fact that this is one of the few books on the Kentucky campaign makes it worth the money. If you are a serious Civil War buff, or are interested in the Kentucky Campaign specifically, I highly recommend that you buy this book."
3,The Civil War in Kentucky,"James Lee McDonough's ""War in Kentucky: From Shiloh to Perryville"" is a noteworthy revisionist view of the Confederate invasion of Kentucky in 1862. McDonough provides a new perspective on the soundness of Confederate General Braxton Bragg's strategic transfer of military operations from northern Mississippi -- adroitly using railroad connections to Chattanooga -- into Kentucky in loose coordination with Edmund Kirby Smith's Army of East Tennessee. McDonough explores Bragg's strategic vision in the campaign's inception as well as the undeniable failure of its ultimate execution. The sanguine affair at Perryville was the culmination of the invasion; its only lasting effects being the relief of Federal General Don Carlos Buell by Lincoln and the manufacture of a poisonous atmosphere among Bragg and his officers. The book is well written, but suffers from too few maps of poor quality."
3,Nice buy.,"I bought this for my mother who has an extreme hummingbird resort in her backyard. This feeder is beautiful hanging in the tree; however, the birds have a hard time finding the hole to drink from. I had to paint a flower around the hole for them to find it.It's a nice buy for someone who loves the beauty of it, but it will confuse the birds for hours."
5,AMAZING !,This book is really the most beautifull and serious book on Eva Duarte de PerÃ³n. I have all the Evita's book and this is the best.Amazing photographs and a brief but interesting text. The first photographic biography of this controvertial woman. EXCELLENT.
5,UNFORGETTABLE! IRRESISTABLE! A visual feast!,"Eva Peron was at a time, one of the most photographed woman in the world (to date, she remains the only Latin American First Lady to appear on the cover of TIME magazine). Looking at this book, it's not hard to see why. A strikingly attractive and elegant woman- she possessed a rare, fragile beauty that is clearly evident in these glossy black and white photographs. Those looking for an in depth biography of this influential woman may be disapointed in the lack of information (the book does include a brief biography and each photograph contain notes and factual information pertaining to that particular photo) but considering the numerous in depth biographies out there, a book like this is a refreshing change. Respectful, accurate and a visual delight, this book is sure to please her legion of admirers- old and new. Highly recommended."
3,one of the best 'death metal' bands of all time.,"This disc would have been better if more studio tracks were included. I don't care for the ""live"" songs (most of disc two). I was also disappointed that 'Eternal Ban' didn't make the roster,it's one of their best. Still there is quite a lot of very good tracks here. Destruction is what death metal was. If you haven't heard them this is your chance to treat yourself."
5,Most Unique and Original Album of All Time!,"Word's can't describe how amazing this album is, SO JUST BUY IT!!!!! and you be the judge."
2,How a good idea becomes annoying noise?,"Some people would think I am a radicalist that hate innovation and think Death Metal old-school is the only thing with valor.They are wrong. I like innovantion! I enjoy Death Metal old-school as I enjoy melodic, progressive or technical Death Metal.But some musicians believe they can mix a lot of strange elements in music with no criterion and it'll be a great innovation. It's called experimentalism.There are great ideas in this album. It would sounds a great innovator Death Metal with progressive and jazz influences, if they didn't mix with robot voices and eletronic music noises."
2,not what i expected,"I bought this album thinking it would sound something like death's human. I was wrong. Although the musicians are very talented not one song made me want to blast it through my speakers. The computerized sounding singing that goes on through the songs gets really annoying and drawn out. i was expecting a heavy melodic masterpeice, instead it was technical, boring, and has no power-in your face at all. If your buying this album based on the fact that paul m is on it and it is going to sound like ""human"" don't waste your money."
5,A musician's album,"If you enjoy innovative music and appreciate the craft, you will love this album. For some people it had to grow on them and I totally understand why. For me, I had parts of many songs stuck in my head after the second listen. This album is simultaneously a celebration of metal and a tribute to jazz. It's almost like they wanted to say ""I know you think metal is all regurgitated and uninspired so listen to what we (metal musicians) can really do. We know where we come from.""If you like good music buy this album. If you do not like good music (ask your buddies), buy two copies so that after you've been transformed you can help one of your friends."
5,"This is the best metal cd ever...well, rivaling with one.","There's only one other metal cd that rivals Focus, and that's Death's immortal recording, Human (which ironically has both Paul and Sean on the recording.) Cynic is able to brilliantly combine both industrial, death metal, and jazz and do it perfectly. Most bands can only do a mediocre job of combining two of the above. From start to finish, the musicianship and writing on Focus will blow your mind. Every musician stands out on this recording with their instrument. It's worth it if you're a fan of Death."
5,Climbing inside the eyelash of a distant fear....,- absolutely brilliant piece of work - incredible musicians - 5 stars aren't enough
3,My Blasphemous Review...,"I know I'm going to get rated down for this, but it is the truth.This is a pretty okay album, it has many redeeming qualities about it. But it's not nearly as good as Cynic's old demos. The tracks in Cynic's 1990 and 1991 demos didn't make it into this album unfortunately so it's going to be hard to make my point unless you download them.If you listen to the demo tracks, you will notice not only that the style is much different but much better. The lightning fast drumming and riffs that bless those tracks condemn this album. It even rivals Slayer's Raining Blood, Death's Symbolic and Possessed's Seven Churches in sheer musicianship.Trust me, listen to those tracks and listen to these. There is no comparison."
3,Perfection lost...,"Cynic is the brain child of Sean Malone. Sean Malone portrays much of his talent on this record, but he appears to be holding back to a certaint degree.Over all its an excellent album, but only has one real jewel in it (Veil of Maya).Also the lyric basis is based around a questionable ""enlightenist"" movement which could scare off a few listeners with its very ""one world order"" veiws that is displayed lyrically on this album.Programing seems to stand out, though is repetitive in nature. But over all its good music and a taste of Sean Malones talent & bass work."
3,Decent German martial arts flick,This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This is a fairlygood German martial arts movie. Not much of a story but the fight scenesare all nicely done. I would say hardcore martial arts fans would get akick out of this flick. This film is in German with English subtitles.I would also like to say that Zora Holt is one beautiful woman and I wouldhave enjoyed seeing more of her in this movie.
4,A bookkeeping book for non-profits,"The book is very good for an understanding of bookkeeping for non-profits with many reminders, charts and instructions. It continually emphasized what was discussed in earlier chapters. And, it gave a review of the bookkeeping basics. There is a lot of information for medium to large non-profits. The book discusses accrual and cash basis. This book would be a good tool for a medium or large organization. The book gave me confidence to do the job as treasurer of a small non-profit as I was reminded of the things I learned in accounting classes that I had many years ago."
5,A logistics major must have !,I read this book years ago and find it quite interesting. Many of the concepts in this books were explained in my transportation class. Mopac was an very important rail line in the Southwest and many of the present day U.P. Managers (i.e. Dick Davidson) came from this railroad. I hope people can draw the history and basic concepts to understand present day railroad operations.
4,Funny 80's movie,"This is a movie everyone has to see. C. Thomas Howell is a great actor. Talk about funny. I laugh harder each and every time I watch this movie. This movie not only is funny but it really points how some people view other cultures, cultures that they just don't understand. It combines humor with sad but true sterotypes that people of the world still believe to this day."
4,C Thomas Howell's best performances since The Outsiders,"Considering the depth in which C Thomas has sunk himself at the end of the 80's, this is his best movie since The Outsiders. It is to be taken as entertainment rather than a ""life lesson on tolerance"" and I loved it. It is among my fav' 80's movies along the side of The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles or the Karate Kid."
1,DOESN'T DO THE JOB,"Sorry, but the scrubbing beads in this product are just too small. I tried it as a replacement for DDF Acne Pumice Scrub which was discontinued. With DDF I haven't had a blemish in 10 years. With this product I immediately broke out. So far the best replacement for DDF is the Peter Thomas Roth Acne Scrub. Sorry, Clearasil, you should make a product that works."
4,A truly engrossing tale,"As an avid fan of fantasy fiction I was looking forward to entering into this new world I'd discovered. I only gave it a 4 star rating as I felt it took to long to actually start the tale, although once started I was totally engrossed and especially found the way she included the plottings and ministrations of the gods (the vixen,Baba Yaga etc) truly marvellous! I rushed out to buy book two and must admit to being slightly disappointed as it is a prequel concerning the tale of Avanasy and Ingrid, the first book had left me desperate to find out what happened to Brigett, I can only hope the third book goes back to this enthralling tale."
4,Very Interesting,I thought it was morbid of me to want to read this book...maybe it still is but very interesting!
5,Makes You Think About How Your Day Will Go,"Coroner's Journal: Forensics and the Art of Stalking DeathVERY VIVID accounts.Loved this book,even tho its hard to say I ""loved it"".It was sad and gruesome,horrifying and very detailed.But real,vivid and so honest.You really feel the terror & sadness,you see the scenes from his eyes as he walks into each new crime scene.If you have a weak stomach its not for you.If you love true crime story's,forensic files,or are curious of what really happens with and when death occurs(in detail)and want to learn some things along the ride its the perfect book for you."
5,Great read!,"As a Baton Rouge native, I find this book to be just fascinating. Louis Cataldie is truly a one of a kind human being, and I would like to personally thank him for presenting such a respectable approach to an otherwise gruesome fact of life. It's important to know what really goes on in the world on a day to day basis. Through his writing, Cataldie brings us into what I can only assume was a very big part of his life. Many people will probably never even know who he is, but if you've made it this far than I think you should buy this book 100%."
3,What?,"Ya just don't know what a letdown this is after Vol. 1. Some of the songs on here aren't even rock. The second half gets a lot better, but it still is a real letdown after the glorious metal on the first and third volumes. Asia is not metal. They are hardly rock. I don't understand what they are doing here. The songs by Danger Danger and Enuff Z'Nuff are great and so is Aldo Nova's bone-crunching Fantasy, but some of the stuff on here is for pop fans. No I'm not kiddin'."
5,More great Hits on one CD,"A great followup to the origonal.I am person who has likes multiple music geners of the 80s, hair bands as much as the pop\dance genres. I truely enjoyed this CD, maybe a bit more then the first. IT is less hard edged of the Hair band genre like others mentioned, but still worth the $."
3,Decent good music,It is ok but there are a few songs that just don't make sense for this kind of genre of music.
1,Really?,"I'll admit that I do not own this CD. However I am familiar with the bands and songs included. Most would be barely be considered ROCK and definitely not ""Monsters"". Nelson? Really? Whether or not it is good music is up to the listener, but the songs definitely do not fit the title."
3,A fascinating read.,"The fame of Herbert's Dune series has sadly obscured some of his other science fiction - Santaroga is a prime example. A valley town in California appears to be not just different from the rest of the world around it, but practically on a different planet. It's residents have no interest in the external world or the products it offers - almost an autarky. Driven by a corporate marketing assignment combined with the lure of an old (but strongly flickering) flame, Gilbert Dasein visits the town and finds a bizarre degree of contentment and unity. On the face of it, it is the mysterious Jaspers (akin to the mÃ©lange of Dune) that is responsible but Herbert is driving at a larger picture here. Santaroga is almost a collective mind, or a community with a group consciousness. One that thrives in its little pond and fears the vast ocean outside which it strives to hold at arm's length - the barrier of the title. A fascinating read."
4,An overlooked classic,"Why are all of Frank Herbert's non-Dune books out of print? This one is easily better than the later Dune works.Thumbnail: Summoned by an unforgettable old flame, a scientist visits her home town of Santaroga. He soon realizes this isn't your typical sleepy mountain village: apparently everyone is out to kill him, although each incident seems like an accident. And what is 'jaspers,' the secret ingredient in all their food?Like Herbert's other stories, this one combines mystery and danger; delves into religion and human potential; and keeps you thinking long after you've finished reading it. If you can find it, get it and enjoy."
3,Repetitive.,"I am still a huge Herbert fan, but let's face it, everyone had to to start somewhere. This book lacks the elements most Herbert fans crave. Read this as a hard core Herbert fan so that you can check the box that says yoiu have read all of his works."
5,"Nice meter, fun book, great animals","My daughter's kindergarten class really enjoyed hearing this book read, it's a quick read but is full of interesting animals, many of which were new to the children. Well written, fun meter, great pictures and great info on the animals at the back. Great book!"
1,hot damn!,"This is a sweet deal. I have a PowerMac G4 and the thing worked immediately upon installation. I just put the batteries in the keyboard and mouse, plugged in the USB reciever, and voila! I got it so that I could sit on my couch and browse the web/do homework on my 42"" plasma. I'm very satisfied. I have yet to explore all of the ""hot keys"" at the top, but the volume comtrol and the scroll button both work fine. I've only had it for 3 days, but I love it already!UPDATE....This is an old review and I'm not even sure if these things are still even on the market. Anyhow, I originally gave this 5 stars. It was great at first, but after owning it for about 3 weeks, the thing started acting erratically. The mouse seems to be continuously clicking on its own. I stopped using it way back then. Tried changing the batteries and resetting the computer and blah blah blah. Nothing worked. The thing became unusable due to the mouse issues and so i have to downgrade it to 1 star."
1,Am returning this item,"I am returning this item for several reasons. We bought this keyboard so we could touch one button and have our my documents appear. We could never get this function to work. When we called the support phone number provided with the device, the person who assisted us could not solve the problem and told us they would call back. They never called back. So not only did the device not do what we wanted, we also received very very poor customer service."
2,frustrating,"I have been using the Kensington wireless desktop keyboard and mouse for at least two years. The keyboard is comfortable and has a nice response, and the mouse, when it's working, tracks well. I rarely have problems with the keyboard, but the mouse is a pain in the neck. With about 15 hours of computer use a week, I need to change the batteries in the mouse about every 9 to 12 weeks. The mouse does not work with rechargeable batteries. What is most frustrating is that whenever I change the batteries, I cannot get the mouse to activate. The lights will glow and flash, and I'll follow every troubleshooting step, but the cursor remains motionless. Then one day it'll start working again. I find it necessary to have a back up mouse handy."
2,Great until the new wore off . . .,"The fancy keys and wireless capability were nice for a while; I've had it for about a year.Once the newness of the new toy wore off, I discovered that the mouse eats batteries fast.It died today of consumption.The mouse has really been a pain in the neck the whole year and it's rather large.The keyboard is still working and the keys are quiet; however, it's just too big and it tells me literally once a day that the batteries in it are low though it's a good bit easier on them than the mouse. Some driver issue with Mac OS X but it doesn't bother the way it works.So, after a year, it wasn't really enough bang for the buck overall.A 3 for the keyboard, it's okay but big and huge with the attached wrist rest which has to be there to make it comfortable to type on.Without it, the keyboard is too tall to be so flat.A 1 for the mouse; a battery eating pain that was a constant problem.So a not so great 2 over all."
1,Wish I would have gone to Kensington,"I got this wireless keyboard for a Gateway laptop through Gateway while tyring to problem-solve a compatibility issue. The first one was defective so I exchanged it for another - and that one was defective, too! Both times it was the mouse. I tried to get Gateway to take it back and refund my money because it turned out not to help the compatibility issue and they refused. The keyboard, even though it worked, could not keep up to my typing, forcing me to slow down, go back, start over. Frustrating all around.Please, if you're stuck with this unit, try what someone further down suggested, go right to Kensington. This is NOT a good product, but if you save your receipt, the box guarantees it for five years. I lost that option by thinking only Gateway could refund my money."
2,"Great Mouse, Poor Keyboard","Note that I have used this on my Mac.I don't use the keyboard anymore because the keys require too much pressure (or as one reviewer noted, it skips letters). It is incredibly frustrating to look at your work and see a dozen places where Word is telling me I have typos.When I first got this, I exchanged it for a new one because I thought the keyboard was defective. Not so. The keyboard requires the finesse of a gorilla.I really like the layout of the keyboard and the hot keys across the top. I especially like the keys for changing font between bold, italic, etc.One note: the volume control knob changes the system volume, not the volume of iTunes alone. I'd prefer that the knob change only the volume of iTunes and not everything else.The mouse is wonderful. I use it with my left hand and it is very comfortable. I was using it on my bare desk but I purchased a $3 laser mouse pad and it really improved the tracking.Installation and set up were a breeze."
1,"Low quality product, couldn't hold up my music",The top hinge was too weak to hold up my music books and notebooks. Neither is overly heavy.
2,"Nice stand, cheap materials","After a year of ownership (I like the stand--especially that it can adjust to a low height good for seated guitarist), the knob that loosens the legs stripped off and you can no longer adjust the stand. I have the impression that the metal used on the screw and knob is just too soft for its purpose. I wrote to the company and hope they will make this right by sending a new knob."
5,Awesome stand,"Bought this stand due to how compact it is when folded up. Stays in one piece. Had bought one almost identical to this one but the sheet music holder had to be removed to fold up for transport. Returned to store and ordered this one. Since I am enrolled in a guitar class, very easy to travel with."
2,not very sturdy,"the thing is pretty flimsy, can't hold small books. you can't move it too much or it will collapse. is okay for just sheet music."
1,Do not buy,This is a piece of crude. It is loose and does not even stand up straight. I returned it...do not buy.
4,Height Adjustment,"The delivery was prompt, which is superb. But the maximum height which the stand can extend is still too low if I were to stand up and play the flute. Then again, if you're playing in an orchestra you're mostly sitting down. This is my third music stand and I'm loving this one so far."
3,On Stage Music Stand,"I had this product for 1 month and it has already bent in two places. Although, it still does gets the job done I don't believe it will last too long."
5,Great item!,I was not prepared for the quality of the item. For the price you can't beat this. It is some flimsy elementary school music stand. It is durable and has a great hieght extension.
2,Read the Product Description,"Looking at the picture of this item, I envisioned a heavy duty feeder like the ones my grandparents used to have; and the price was great... The reality is quite different, but, as I see in the product description, it does say ""copper & acrylic."" The point is, this product is primarily made of plastics. Yes, it does have a copper top, and a strip of copper around the bottom, but the rest is fairly light plastic. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it's not what I was picturing. I will certainly use this feeder, and I expect it will last awhile, but before I buy any other products online, I'm going to read all the fine print."
5,Very comfortable,Works as advertised. Very comfortable even when the camera has been around my neck for hours.
4,Is this what it's like to be unconscious?,"Amazing disc. Minimalism that is expressionistic. Ever shut your eyes and stare at the stars and red clouds that dance beneath your eye lids? World's Edge would be the soundtrack to that display. New Age that is etheral to the 10th degree. It is a soundscape that looks to the heavens (starry night) for its inspiration, but is rooted in something that is cthonic and primordial. Another Steven Roach fan who is a friend of mine prefers the ""Early Man"" album to this album. Uh uh. No way. What ""Early Man"" does for a jurassic feel, ""World's Edge"" would be the audio experience that comes from sensory deprivation. It can reach inside you and squeeze your heart a bit too tightly if you let it. That sounds extreme, but there is something to this disc that can send the listener on an astral journey, if you let it....."
2,Oh those Italians,"I've heard over the years how awful Italian choirs can be. Unfortunatly this recording PROVES that point. I was truly disappointed by this recording. The singing sounds like about 30 Italian opera singers got together to make this recording. There is no blend, no unity of voices, and the overall ensemble is very poor. I think even the recording quality is pretty poor."
1,"Either a bad tool, or a bad operator","...but I'm going to claim the former. I had to cut a bunch of 6 1/2"" holes for can lights, and based on Greenlee's reputation, I sprung for this tool. Fortunately, I practiced on a scrap of drywall, and what a disaster. There's not enough strength in the drywall to hold the pilot bit in position, so the entire ""saw"" (2 blades) wanders all over. A beaver could have chewed a better hole than this made. I went out to Sears and bought a $4 drywall hole saw and made short work of the project. This'll be on eBay shortly."
1,Waste of money,Forget this item it is a waste of money. I ruined more ceiling tiles with this because it slips and does not cut a round hole it moves around causing a bad cut and also scraped many parts of the tile when cutting. I would recommend either using a hand saw or a rotozip over this worthless item.
2,"Worked OK, but a Rotozip is a beter choice","I had 10 cans to put in the ceiling, and tried this tool first. Instructions are very poor, but when I tried it, it did make a decent hole. Unfortunately my measurements were off by 1/2 inch, so the hole was not well centered.The biggest issue I had using it was in locating the exact center of where the hole should be. I only used it on that one hole. For the rest I used my Rotozip spiral cutter. Saw a video on Utube where a guy just did a plunge cut into the approximate location of the can, moved out till he felt it hit the outside, repositioned it outside the can, and then just felt his way around the can. It left a clean hole in exactly the right place in about 5 seconds. I tried it, and it was much faster, easier and left a tight hole. So that is how I did all the rest (and outlet boxes too)."
1,"Broke within 20 seconds, can't replace pilot bit","Bought it some years back (at HD?), just used it:1. Very short detent pins fit into dimples, providing 1/2"" diameter adjustment increments. I'd like to see a finer adjustment and am not sure the setting will hold.2. Center hub is all one piece including the 1/8"" pilot bit. So the center pivot is a 1/8"" drill bit extending about 1-1/2"" from the center hub to workpiece, which has to withstand any unbalanced forces from blades that have about 3"" of leverage. And this is intended for use in a hand drill, above your head. I tried to be careful, however the pilot bit snapped off at the hub within 20 seconds and 1/8"" into the first hole. There is no way to replace the pilot drill without buying a whole new center hub.I'd consider a revised version with a 3/16"" or 1/4"" replaceable pilot drill, but won't be getting another of this one. NOT recommended."
3,It's like Saturday Night Fever without the disco music and dancing.,"This is Joe Pesci's first major acting role. This movie is ok if ya like movies like ""The Lords of Flatbush"" or ""Saturday Night Fever"", or ""fingers"". It's like a typical 70's cinematography movie but it was made in the early 80's. Good Italian acting and actors. Especially the young looking Frank Vincent from the Sopranos. Nothing extraordinary but just a good italian american movie. I found it in a grocery store for $3.99 and it was worth it to me."
1,This is not authentic escada,"I recently bought one with the understanding that my purchase was for an authentic escada cow leather purse made in Italy with an authenticity card. Instead, I received a knock-off vinyl material without any security tag and authenticity card. Hardwares are tacky imitation."
3,Doesn't fit kids tiny arms.,"I thought I'd get this for my 2nd grade boys team, not realizing that it is sized for adults. My fault for not researching properly, but wanted to let anyone else out there know to not buy this size if you're looking to outfit your youth team with a captain's armband. :)"
3,Captain Armband.,"The delivery was fast. I got it with in 3 days. The only downside to it . . I recieved a Yellow arm band with a silver ""C"" and I was expecting a white C like the one pictured above."
5,"Great for bioarchaeologists, forensics or dental students!",This book was written by my professor at University College London. It is really thorough and it explains everything you need to know about teeth.
3,Nothing serious..,"Althought Ferus Mustafov and Milan Zafkov are very good players the compositions on the album are very well known pieces... some of them are maybe ten years old or more.. These two musicians haven't done nothing inventive in the last period.. Even compared with the music of our colleagues from Bulgaria created in the 80's..However, I would like to send warm greetings to everybody who is interested in what we call Balkan music.. :-)One love!"
5,Buy This CD,"Big in Australia, you're not going to hear this type of music on the radio - it isn't aimed at ""tweens"" or urban hip. A banjo here or there - yes... but it's not country and it's not bluegrass. Think the best of folk rock of the 70s updated to the new century tastes. If you like the styling of Iron and Wine or Ray LaMontagne, then you're going to love this CD."
1,Canon Multipass C555 - UnReliable and BEWARE,"I purchased the Canon Multipass C555 in August 2001, and have all types of problems. Big compatibility problems with windows XP. Spent three seperate conversations with tech people who couldnt help me get it to interface. Total time on the telephone was approximately 5 hours and 12 minutes. The copier is very slow, and the scanner [is bad]. Ended up sending the printer back to Canon, with no results. This printer got slammed against the cement, and is now in the trash. In my opinion I will never by a Canon product again."
1,Worst Printer Ever,"I have had this printer for three years now and it has been nothing but trouble from day 1! If it's not the alarm light going off then it is skipping lines while printing. The fax machine is no better. ""Best of all"" Canon is nooooo help whatsoever. Their drivers don't work. I have had to reistall drivers tons of times, all to no avail. DO NOT BUY!!!!"
3,frustrated,when i bought my cannon c555 i was very pleased on how it worked...but when i cant get the alarm light off and an err keeps flashing that my cartridge needs to be put in when it is in and full of ink..THATS FRUSTRATING....i cant get the alarm light off and cant print....i cant get any tech information over the internet without having to pay for it...thats frustrating...ive had it for about 2 years and this is the first time i cant find tech help.....thank you and good luck
2,waste of money,"This machine has been nothing but trouble for me. Have had to reinstall the drivers several times, and the drivers from the Canon site don't even work. It goes through tons of ink jet cartridges at an enormous cost. Then every so often have to spend another $50-$60 for another entire ink jet cartridge. Customer support is about $10 each time you call, and it doesn't always help. It's very difficult to run a business with this difficult machine!"
1,A Piece of JUNK!!!,"I purchased my third canon printer last year and decided to go with a multifuntional one======WHAT A MISTAKE THAT WAS!!! It has NOT worked more than it has worked!!!!!!!!!!!! As soon as I got one thing straightened out, another would pop up!!! I've been out looking for a new one and it WON'T BE A CANON!!! The techs didn't even know what to do with it!!!!"
2,Dependable is not the word to use to describe this unit,"Three days after installing I find that it will copy quite well tho the color is not spectacular. Trying to get it to print from PC screen is a severe problem. When it works, and that has been about 25% of the time the quality is very good and the fact that it is slow doesn't bother me. Downloading suggested drivers to cure a problem where it refuses to print because of errors has not helped. If I was more courageous I'd return it for credit but will probably keep it as a copying device."
1,service support and proper working with exsisting system,"I have tried and tried for the pass few weeks to get my c555 to perform the advertised functions i,e,. print/fax and scan properly, with out going thru a long drawn out process. I have it set up as sugested by the set up option. But each time i turned on my computerit does connect and request the c555 status bar. I have yet to print from my cpu as it should. one fax from Canon service automation department. Tried to call to get help as it is rquested when having trouble getting it to work right. As of yet have not received the technical support promised thru Canon advertisement and registry program."
1,Did not even last a year!!!,"I purchased this machine in Sept 2001 and it gave me headache after headache. I had problems installing it. The ink cartridges were tiny and needed to be replaced often. The printer died and Canon's support suggested that I needed a new BC-21e print head/cartridge combo. At $50, I think not!!!! I've seen brand new printers advertised for this price. I prefer to put the money toward a better printer. I also will never consider another all in one machine again. When the printer died, I lost my copier and my fax machine as well."
3,canon support and drivers,The support canon offers is non existant. For that reason alone I would not suggest you run out and buy anything they offer. The driver never works. Every time I boot up I get the same old message that it could not load? Yet I can print?? The printing is acceptable. Canon should have stuck with the stand alone copier business. Dont buy the name if you plan to use it with a pc.
3,Damn what happened?,"The Ten Commandments is like by far the best of all their albums. Then Retribution came along and it wasn't as furious and fast as the Ten Commandments, but still good....and now Stillborn. First thing i noticed is the production, it's slower, and.....GODDAMN Hoffman, what happened? vocals are by far unbearable and too mediocre and....dead i say, just dead.i would rather prefer this album over the fine art of murder, envemoned, the will to kill, and warkult, because those albums suck.and yes these guys went through some hard times during the release of this album, so i don't blame them"
2,not what i expected,"From the description of the item saying it's assorted colors and the picture showing 4 different perches i thought i was getting multiple perches, but instead i just received one. if i had known it was just one perch i would not have ordered it. Description and picture seems to be very deceiving."
3,Great item but notice: it is only for ONE perch!,"Great item but notice: it is only for ONE perch!I ordered this item believing it was for a set of 4! Nowhere can I see that it says for ""one perch only"" and ""please pick a flavor"". It also doesn't say ""let us pick a flavor for you,"" so it leads one to think you are getting all four. If I missed something, I'm sorry for complaining and dumb me, but if not, read on.By the time you pay shipping, it is a whopping $11.50 for the medium. I am sure it would be cheaper in a pet store or other store.Glad it is made in the USA and looks to be a great item, but think the ad should be rewritten to be more clear. I will be extremely careful in the future."
5,A delicious lighthearted adventure,"A boy accidentally releases a terrible red dragon from the magical Book of Beasts. His first attempt to make it right is clever--maybe clever enough, in some lesser storybook--but no, it doesn't work: the boy must face the dragon himself.The way Edith Nesbit gets her hero into and out of this predicament is the defining quality of the book. There is peril, yes, and bravery, and adventure--but none of the grim, visceral struggle or the emotional sound and fury of, say,Saint George and the Dragon. Instead the turns in the plot are surprising, lighthearted, silly even--yet clever, with a certain satisfying fairy-tale logic.This is an abridged, picture-book version of the original (inThe Book of Dragons), which I have not read. The illustrations (like the prose) are airy, comic, and marvelous. Perhaps because it wasn't originally intended for a picture-book audience, the story will be a vocabulary builder for young children. Grown-ups will find much to savor here."
2,For Legacy Apps Only,buy this product only if you are using legacy code in your applicaiton. OWC is on the EOL path of Microsoft and being replaced by Excel Services.
5,Nice clear pads to keep cabinets from bumps,"These are great clear tiny pads to stick on your walls, cabinets, under items that may scratch your coffee table. They do come off, not permanent, that is okay by me. If you put it in the wrong place then move it. There are 375 in a package, so you have some to spare. I think some reviews say they came off & that will happen especially if you wax or use cleaning agents with oil. They are just bumpers, not to last forever but I find them very useful to protect my new kitchen cabinet doors."
3,this is the reason you've never heard of Spiral Jetty,"The reason you've never heard of Spiral Jetty (unless you're a hippie, or a fan of Led Zeppelin's tour entourage of the mid-70's, or both) is this rather pathetic Talking Heads-esque jumble of staccato verses and choruses. The vocalist leaves practically everything to be desired. The basslines are jumpy yet frolickingly upbeat and the guitarist is now a lecturer in English. I guess there's nothing essentially wrong with BAND OF GOLD, but then again, there's nothing essentially right about it either. I'll admit that a few of the tunes did get my foot tapping, but I won't tell you why."
3,"OK, but not great","I like the color and the weight of the blanket. It has an unusual smell to it . . . not bad or offensive, just different. It washed up nicely . . . still has the unusual smell though. I would rather have been extremely pleased with the purchase than to have it be a mediocre satisfaction rating."
5,Took the breath right outta me,"I bought this book because of an issue I was going through (not with my sweet husband!)...and I was so surprised at the frank honesty and eye opening accounts given in this slim paperback novel.As I read, I could see certain men playing out in my mind, and understanding now, their cruel behavior...they HATE women. Sigh.this book should be a must read by anyone who offers counselling services (pastors, lay pastors, deacons, etc). Additionally, it would be a good elective read for young people in highschool/college.I am better for having read it...."
1,Do you believe in 1 Peter 3:1?,"Do you believe in 1 Peter 3:1? If not, then you will love this book; if so, then you will see the fundamental problem with it. I pray for the men and households of the women who read this book. The book is like a shotgun, it hits its target, but it also hits the poor creatures that are anywhere in the vicinity of the target."
3,Christian Men Who Hate Women - by Dr. Margaret J. Rinck,"I have not finished reading ""Christian Men Who Hate Women"" by Dr. Margaret J. Rinck, as it's not as easy to read as ""Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them"" by Susan Froward, but it is a great addition it. It breaks down the characteristics of the misogynist to different levels. So, while you don't see all of the listed characteristics in the person you are trying to understand, you can still identify whether or not they are a misogynist on some level.On EASE OF READING, I would rate this book 3/5.Somehow it doesn't flow smoothly enough for me. Perhaps it uses too many clinical terms, I'm not sure.On CONTENT, I would rate it a 5/5.GOOD INFORMATION."
4,For the non-casual fan.,"If you're more a casual fan, I wouldn't recommend this. However, if you own everything, or you're a big fan of their newer stuff, i'd definitely recommend this one. This, together with the Solsbury Hill single essentially make up another album. There's no new b-sides on this one. But the Dan Frampton mix improves on the original single. The remix of Walking in the Rain also is much better than the album version. The single is worth it alone for the remix of When Will I See You Again (my favorite off of Other People's Songs) and the acoustic version of Can't Help Falling in Love. Unlike some of their other ""acoustic"" songs, this is an actual acoustic guitar-only song, and is much better than the album version. Basically if you're a huge fan, or just loved Other People's Songs, get this--you won't be disappointed. (You also want to make sure you get the Solsbury Hill single--one of the best singles they've released)."
3,"Good Song, Not As Good A Single",I loved this song and the album it comes from but I didn't enjoy this as much as the Solsbury Hill CD Single before it. If you're a ie hard fan this might be a must have for the video and the remixes that aren't to be found anywhere else. If you're a casual fan I'd suggest getting the album and not this CD Single.
5,Great Concert Photos!!!,"This is an absolutely delightful book for anyone who loves the Beatles, Paul McCartney or great photography. The photos are full of energy and showcase Paul's powerful stage presence. The text written by fans who attended the concerts and by the author are fun and catch the spirit of the shows.This is a must have book!"
2,A bit disapointed,"Jorie Gracen's book on Paul McCartney has some good photo's but I found it very disapointing. It seemed as if most of the pictures could have been taken for such magazines like the Globe or Star. Although there are a few wonderful pictures, overall I would think anyone with a camera who was able to get close to Paul McCartney could take pictures like the ones featured in this book. To say Ms. Gracen's photos are like the late Linda McCartney is a far out lie! Gracen's photos are nothing like Linda's. If you are a fan of McCartney and like to look at photos of him this isn't a bad book, but if you want to look at quality photos of him, skip this book an buy a book by Linda McCartney."
2,Skip the words/stick with the pictures,"This is a beautifully shot, carefully bound, very glossy tour program. The pix are great, and though I agree with the reviewer who pointed out that there isn't much variety here, they do give the viewer the a real sense of being in the front row of the concert. That's something the author should be very proud of. But the text! Geez! Story after story about looking for Paul, finding Paul, how Paul changed his or her life ... After a while, you're tempted to take the entire endeavor less seriously because the stories are so silly. That's a shame, because the pix are very good."
5,Jories book is an experience,I have been a Paul McCartney fan since his Beatle days. I have never had the pleasure of seeing him in person or in concert. When I read Jories book I felt as though I had experienced through her eyes and the people who submitted stories what it would be like to see Paul in concert. It was more of an experience than just reading a book. The pictures were very touching. It isn't hard to see that Jorie takes pictures with care. Bonnie
2,Too jaundiced a view of Rome for this series.,"I have read dozens of books on Rome over the years, and I am compelled to warn fellow readers that this one is for a very narrow taste. The author's idiosyncratic observations and very verbose writing style beg for better editing. This might have been entertaining as a magazine article. However, as a book purporting to be "" a cultural and literary companion"", author and editor must share the blame for not working the text into a better product. The acidic point of view almost worked, but in the end fell flat."
3,"Pretty clueless, pretty out of date","It is simply amazing that anyone still bothers with Christopher Lasch. He is apparently one of those neo-conservative writers who desperately wish to be considered 'faithful' to the old Left. Well, he's not fooling me. I picked this thing up at the library and was hooked- not for his ideas, which are predictable and even conservative, but for the way he thinks he has something conclusive to say about everything. He is afraid of contemporary feminist challenges to his own assumptions, is afraid of African Americans making a world for themselves, afraid of everything. As a feminist and a white Woman who empathizes with African Americans and other exploited peoples, I know I can find better discussions of the politics of race and gender in the United States. Don't bother with this one, please."
2,"ambitious, but should be better","The orchestral ensembles are a nice addition for us bassoonists who are used to hearing these with only piano accompaniment. Yet it's hard to overlook the slapped together performance of Daniel Smith. His intonation and tone are simply wretched throughout most of the the collection. He exemplifies the ""farting bedpost"" variety of bassoon sound that most people work their whole lives to control and develop into a beautiful technique. This collection is a nice reference considering the large catalog of Vivaldi bassoon concerti which are too often overlooked, but I can't recommend it as an example of well crafted bassoon playing"
1,Popsicle sticks.,"I read in the program notes that this is the only CD set of the complete Vivaldi Bassoon Concertos. Too bad. I am happy that I bought this box set at a closeout sale and did not pay full price.What an ugly tone. It sounds like he made his bassoon reed out of popsicle sticks. Yech!!!I am an amateur bassoonist, I play on synthetic reeds, and I swear that I can get a better sound out of the instrument than Mr. Smith does.1/19/2007: I am modifying my comments slightly because the performances with the English Chamber Orchestra (ECO) do not sound as bad as the performances with the Zagreb Soloist. I can listen to the performances with the ECO without the desire to poke a pencil in my eardrums. Still one star."
2,a bad fit,"Because I needed to buy a new blade anyway, I decided to get the bottom cap also, as my old one was looking a bit rough. It was a waste of money, though. The blender would work with the new cap, but it didn't work as well as it usually does. Because the new bottom cap wasn't an exact fit, it took me twice as long to make my smoothies as it normally does. I wouldn't buy a new bottom cap unless you absolutely have to. I went back to using my old one."
1,Does not work!,"I bought this because my bottom cap broke. This does not fit well with the mixer, its hard to put it on and also leaks."
2,Not a good part,I have had the replacement bottom for about a year ;it leaks and is cracked and does not fit the spindle on my Oster Bar Blender that I love . Frustrating !!I hesitate to buy another one as I'm afraid it will happen again.
1,Leaky,"My blender is a 10-speed Oster blender, Model 6640 with a plastic pitcher, and this product does not fit it very well - it does not screw on tightly. Thus, the blender leaked all over the darn place. This product is NOT for all Oster blenders!!!!"
2,Not near Original Qality,"I bought this knowing that it is not by Oster but for Oster. But still, can be better quality and fit. Only worth the 2-3 bucks you spend on it."
4,blender part,These plastic jar bottom caps keep breaking so I went ahead and bought several for our blender. They came quickly and fit as they should.
3,Jar Bottom for Oster lender,The jar bottom is too fragile and I had to replace it for months after the purchase of the blender. Make sure to order spare parts. I feel I will be replacing the bottom often.
3,thinner than expected,"As others have noted, this is really light weight compared to the original.It may be less brittle and last just as long; I don't know yet.I've used it once and there were no leaks."
2,Thinner than original Oster part,"This part may serve its purpose, but it is made of thinner plastic than the original (Oster brand)part."
4,good,"The product arrived on time but it did not have a packing as displayed in the picture, it was wrapped in a brown paper. I have an osterizer blender and was concerned if it would fit, but it turned down my suspicions. Fits perfect. Will recommend this seller and the product."
1,disappointing,"This did nit work for our Oster Blender, it fits as far as width goes, but was not the same dpth as what our blender neede. Our blender will run, but does not work like it used to, don't know why really? but it has to do with the depth!"
2,Doesn't fit every blender type.,Leaked a lot because it wasn't a good fit for my Osterizer blender. I ended up needing to buy a whole new set.
5,Fit Perfectly,"I have an Osterizer blender. My old bottom cap had been cracked for quite a while and I was putting off getting a replacement. Finally it was totally dead, so I decided to order this one. It fits like a dream and I'm using my blender way more often now. Worth it!"
5,porta cable saw blade,This blade works great on my porta cable trim saw. It is the one that comes stock when you buy it and I have tried one with more teeth thinking it would work better but it didn't and had a tendon see to bind up and kick back?
1,This is bad advice,This book is really not very good. I mean how can 30 minutes possibly be enough exercise. There are definitely better books out there that someone can buy to learn how to exercise properly.
2,Lacking the Energy of Movement for Living,"I have to admit I haven't read this book and perhaps never will. I have however, seen how the ideas in this book is applied by a believer of these authors (Protein Power) when working out. The mere concept of slowness that the title suggests is disturbing.""Results"" has been the buzz word to getting healthy and fit. Yet, it is proving to be an obstacle to what people NEED more of - movement. People might want results in ""30 minutes a week"" but unfortunately only at the great expense or should I say excuse of moving less and believing this is best in their lifetime.We need to move more, not less. We all need to practice moderation in all things, not adhering to one extreme (e.g., short duration workouts) or the other (e.g., long duration workouts)."
5,INCREDIBLE book - REVOLUTIONARY BREAK THROUGH!,"Fred Hahn gives you the huge advantage in building muscle! Real muscle, not steroid muscle. Easy to read - I read it aloud to my wife in one night! You don't have to belong to a gym to use his techniques - easy 'how to' descriptions and photos make this the greatest muscle building method I've ever seen or used! Great writing by Dr Eades - my favorite doc!"
5,"30 minutes a week to a fit, healthy body","The Slowburn Fitness Revolution is a fascinating concept, and I have begun to make the effort to get fit with this very short, though intense, workout program. The principles of increasing strength and bone density and even cardio-vascular health with this new (to me) approach make good sense as explained by the authors. The book also motivated me to start eating more healthfully. I certainly would be thrilled to become fit, loose weight, and accomplish all the other benefits claimed by the authors, working out for just 30 minutes a week! And with minimal home workout equipment, and minimal risk of injury. After my first two workouts I was a bit sore, but am expectiing great things! I think I can do this!"
1,Balderdash,"At first glance the thinking person will dismiss this book and its premise as nonsense. After reading it, you find it is nonsense badly written. Evidently the writer was paid per cliche, with a bonus for repetition. If you can stay with this book all the way through, either you have unusual fortitude or lack reading comprehension."
2,Not a great book,"My wife and I followed this exercise routine, having decided to try something new. A friend of ours recommended this book and liked the workout so we thought we'd try it. We gave up our previous exercise routine but both my wife and myself were disappointed with the results for the majority. The one good thing I guess is that in encouraged us to perhaps try lifting heavier weights than we had been doing, but giving up the cardiovascular exercise, as the book recommends, was just not a good idea for both of us. My running suffered alot because of this, so now that I've started running again I feel much better. My wife's tennis game also suffered, so she is back doing her regular cardiovascular routine.I've read a few books on exercise and this isn't one that I would put at the top of my list by any means."
5,The Slow Burn Fitness Revolution,"The Slow burn weight lifting approach really works. I would recommend it to seniors like myself who want to increase muscle tone and not injure themselves in the process. I started out exercising 3 times per week and then once per week and I still lost weight, increased my strength and muscle tone."
1,My energy diminished,"I followed the program in this book and found it less than satisfactory. Basically, I cut back my exercise from 5-6 days a week to 2 days a week, as recommended. I found that my energy levels on the days I didn't exercise were low. I like to exercise in the mornings because it gives me an energy boost for the day and I feel great all day. This still occurred on the 2 days that I did exercise, but barely, since my exercise was only 15 minutes (twice per week), as outlined in the book. I felt dragged out on the days I didn't exercise, so I believe there is a shortfall in the exercise guidelines in this book.I have now switched back to exercising daily, and I feel great. I plan on running a marathon soon as well, so I joined a running group which teaches you how to schedule proper run times to be able to do well in the marathon. I dare say that stopping to run, or even reducing my running would never allow me to complete this marvelous feat."
4,Finally- the truth be told,"Bottom line: cardio is inefficient, time consuming, and not results oriented-Serious weight training- high resistance, little momentum- will give you results, faster and more effectively-It's basic science: the more lean muscle mass, the faster and more efficient your metabolism, the more bodyfat you burn, the healthier you are; you don't increase muscle by cardio-this book shows you the way- clearly and straightforwardlyBuy it for everyone you know who exercises, or should-"
4,It takes some effort but it works !,The first time i tried the exercises i dropped two pounds ! I couldnt do even one repetition on two of the workouts but after three sessions now have the strength to dive right in to them !
3,Going out to purchase,"I was kind of on the fence about if I should purchase this book until I read the review of ""Garbage-just another crash diet - A Reader from Kansas City, MO"". That made me decide that I would definately go out today and buy it.I wanted to point out that his comment about people who follow low-carb eating will gain all their weight once they go back to eating the normal way is not very well thought out. Low-Carb eating is not a ""Diet"" it is a way of eating, a way of life. It would be the same if someone went to Weight Watchers lost their weight and then returned to their old way of eating. They too would gain their weight back.I have researched and heard from people who are doing this type work out. You don't have to kill yourself in a gym everyday to get toner, slimmer and more in shape. If this book isn't for you please don't buy it. But don't ridicule the rest of us."
5,awsome,"where all other fitness books fall short. this one doesnt....the authors hit a home run with this..it gets to the point, explanes why, and pictures show you how. i liked the idea you can actually do this at home for little or no money.."
5,Revolutionary; wish this was printed years ago,"The two negative revies below obvious haven't done any research on this topic, approach, or author. There have been success tories printed in GQ, (editor Art Cooper lost 60 lbs via thi smethod), an editor of Vanity Fair as well. There are plenty of success stories if you take time to look for them.The premise of this book makes sense, the examples are hard to argue. The author does a great job of making the science of building muscle very clear and easy to understand. By citing specific examples of how other have failed, mistrained, and been miseducated are clear, current, and understandable."
2,A SuperSlow wannabee,"Slow exercise is not new; Bob Hoffman mentioned it decades ago in his books but it was not until Ken Hutchins,working for Nautilus arrived at the conclusion that slow exercise resulted in tremendous gains in muscle andimprovement in bone density. This author says nothing new. I recommend BODY BY SCIENCE instead of this book."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED!,This 10 year dated book is mediocre at best. The Power Of 10 is a superior book as is the bargain pricedSLOW MOTION WEIGHT TRAINING - FASTER MUSCLE GAIN IN LESS TIME AT HOME OR GYM FOR MEN & WOMEN - HOW TO BOOK & GUIDE FOR SMART DUMMIES. Petty Mr. Hann has done an attack review of this superior book. I own all of these books and Mr. Hanns books (he has two other solo books) are all poorly done against the competition mentioned above.
2,SLOW GOING,"The first 85 pages of this book try and sell the reader on weight training, and discourage people from running.Another book uses the supper slow method to get amazing results the book: Bigger Muscles in 42 Days by Ellington Darden. In this book he uses the supper slow method to help the man pictured on the cover build 34 pounds of muscle in 42 days. The supper slow method woks but I am not sure that you can get everything out of the gym in just 30 min per week. When I did the Darden program 15-20 min. 6 says per week is all I could do at the gym. The Darden program had me working 4x more than this program.You can skip this book if you know that each exercise is doe for ten seconds up, and ten seconds down. Working your muscles until failure."
1,NOT worth reading,"This book is filled with misleading, incorrect and unsubstantiated claims regarding the benefits of a type of exercise referred to as Slow Burn, a type of super slow strength training. Therefore, it is not worth reading. If you really want to know why you should avoid this book, then you should read the in-depth analysis that my colleague and I recently did on it. Just Google; ""SPEED: Fred Hahn's Slow Burn Fitness Revolution book- Part 2: An in-depth analysis of the information presented in this book"". Get the facts before you buy this book."
2,Too Boring to Continue,"I tried Fred's Slow Burn exercise routing for two weeks, 2-3 days a week. As far as seeing any results, I didn't, although had I kept with it longer I may have(?) In any event, I found doing these (or any) exercises so painstakingly slow was excrutiatingly DULL and TEDIOUS. After only the first couple workouts, I found myself dreading the next one. So after taking his advise and spending money on a fan and metronome, I am abandoning this disappointing workout."
4,"OK, but not necessarily for elderly couch potato","Item was purchased at behest of physical therapist for my 90+ year old couch potato father. He is NOT up on current excercise and physical fitness terms, so he found it rather difficult to understand. We'll see how it goes."
2,Great Concept poor to low examples,"I was very interested in the concept of the slow burn work out. The book began with interesting concepts and theories though a bit brief (book is only 181 pages). However when it got to the exercises' it only had 13 for the gym and it looked like exercise for dummies in slow motion. There is minimal description and use info with no alternatives. Also, since muscles tend to adapt to the same routine there were no alternatives for developing a long term program.This book is a total waste of time and money. The Eade's duo have done a real disservice to their Protein Power reputation by putting out a quick money raising hack of a self help book."
4,"Good boook, good motivation - no excuses","Fredrick Hahn's book on slow motion exercise is a well-written and well-organized book as opposed to Zickerman's Power of Ten.Hahn included a whole section devoted to at home routines, while Zickerman is convinced you will sooner or later join the gym anyway.I have just started; so far I can't vouch for the results. Nonetheless, they sound promising and the whole approach makes sense."
1,Nothing new here,"Many books have been written about the minor league experience. But this one offers little new or refreshing. Rather, it is the obvious story of a man in the midst of a mid-life crisis. At one point, amazingly, his wife even asked him if he wanted permission to sleep around during his hiatus from home, children and ostensible repsonsibility. I'm surprised he declined. Grow up, Mr. Conan. You should have stayed at NPR.For readers interested in a great book about life in the minors, check out David Lamb's classic, Stolen Season. That's a book worth owning and reading."
4,Could have been better.,The author chose a very interesting subject and wrote about his year where he left NPR and became a minor league baseball announcer. I thought that the prospects of a great book were in order however the author chose to digrese to events that had nothing to do with his year in baseball. If he wanted to write an auto biography then these events would have been approptiate. He also could have expanded on his work in the minor leagues and covered the entire season instead of leaving gaps.
4,Excellent,Loved this book. Conan is an excellent storyteller and he really captured the tale without falling into stereotypical story lines.
4,Gotta love the '80s,"It was interesting when I opened this cd and put it in the cd player. Both of my parents went crazy about it. I thought it was cool because it brought back a few of the interesting songs that you know, but you can't really remember the names or artists... I really like the cd, and a lot of my friends are already asking to borrow it. I think that people should get it if they want a blast from the past. It really brought back memories from living in the '80s. Get it if you want a flashback!"
3,It's copper-colored PLASTIC,"My feeder just arrived, and as I feared but could not find in writing for sure, the top is copper-COLORED PLASTIC. I have one exactly like this but with a gray plastic top that has turned brittle with UV over the few years it's been up, and in fact a recent hail storm poked a hole in the brittle roof. Can anyone tell me if this copper-colored plastic top will hold up better than my gray-plastic top? I'm thinking not. I'll have to compare prices a little harder now, and decide if I'm sending it back."
2,Topflight Copper Triple Tube Bird Feeder,"This feeder was NOT as represented. First it is NOT copper, it is plastic. I think Amazon should mention this in a birder feeder that costs this much. In the contents list in the box it lists a mounting pole is enclosed. It was not included, and not in the subsequent replacement feeder either. The plastic pieces that govern seed size that are on each port all broke after the first refill. So, I'm pretty much stuck with using large sunflower seeds for it. Also, I must have pretty smart squirrels where I live, as they have no trouble getting into this feeder via the squirrel guard. I would not recommend this for anyone. I wish I had sent the replacement feeder back."
3,plastic copper extremely misleading,"the feeder itself is functional, but it is seriously misleading to call it a copper feeder and put copper colored plastic as the most prominently featured ""copper"". It is serviceable and the birds don't care, but I felt taken advantage of by this company and by amazon for not noting this."
4,Nice Bird Feeder,"Its not ALL Copper, just the bands around the feeding ports. The rest is plastic. Still, its not a bad feeder, and its very attractive. It holds a lot of feed, and has the ability to adjust the opening of each port. There was a mention of a 1"" pole in the instructions, but there was not one in the box. Its easy to fill, and with the clear tubes, easy to see when you are running out of feed. I've not had it outside very long yet, so I cant say how well it is going to hold up to the weather, or the squirrels."
1,Disappointing,"Well I bought this item for our house, and it looked great in the beginning, I expected the seed to get damp, so I kept it half full to not waste to much seed. The disappointing thing is how fast if fell apart. The bottom fell off (glued it), then all of the little seed covers popped out or were chewed off. Looked good just didn't last 6 months."
1,Horrible! Buy something else!!,"The tube failed 3 days after the warranty. When you pour food into it, the food just runs out onto the ground. Expensive yet cheap."
4,nice product,"nice product,needs to be more squirrel proof. One sat on the lower rim and ate at will from the top holes"
2,"Squirrels, doves and sparrows like this feeder",Every morning I come out and chase the squirrels off this feeder. Later on the doves come and sit on the tray and eat the seeds. Sparrows also like it but no bird that I have seen has used the little slots to grab on to feed. Most of the birds that come to my yard prefer the single tube feeders. The squirrel guard should be floppy and this feeder has a stable guard.Opus 71032 Topflight Copper Triple Tube Bird Feeder
5,Fantastic Bird Feeder,I absolutely love my new three tube bird feeder - excellent ! Not only does the copper effect look great but larger capacity is economical when you have many visitors plus the birds love using it too !The delivery was really quick - I couldn't believe it had arrived already.First Class all round !
5,It was a good bird feeder.,It was a nice looking feeder until a bear found it . He tore the bottom off and ruined one of the tubes. This is why weare ordering a new one. You will have to find a way to make them bear proof.
2,"Not squirrl proof, seed pours out","I have had this about a year, the feeding ports that switch from thistle feed to sunflower seed have been completely chewed up by either the birds or the squirrels. So now when I try to fill the feeder the seed simply pours out all over the ground. This was a gift, I do not have any warranty information and cannot find any info on the company for any replacement parts. It's a shame because I hate to just throw it out, before they ate through the ports it worked great, all my birds loved it. The squirrels can get into it so you do need other baffels for them.I do agree that it should not be advertised as ""copper"". It is copper colored plastic. This was not an issue for me, but I can see how it would be for others if they did not read carefully.Anyone have any contact information on the company so I can try to get replacement parts?"
1,BEWARE of buying this!,"I purchased one of these feeders in late August, 2009 and in less than 3 weeks, one of the cheap plastic flip gates (that control seed delivery at each of the ports) had either broken off or a bird or squirrel had eaten it, and I can now only fill that tube half way (it was an upper port), because the seeds spill out of the open port. I wrote the company at the address listed in their warranty information and the letter was returned by the Post Office as undeliverable. Either the address is phony or the company has gone out of business or moved without leaving any forwarding address. I am now stuck with a feeder that is operational on 2 1/2 tubes, for which I paid nearly $60.My advice - find another feeder to buy! Looks good, but if it breaks you are stuck!"
4,Holds a lot of seed,"The birds and I are quite pleased with this feeder because it holds more than a week's worth of seed and has several perches to accommodate multiple eaters. Note that the top and bottom are plastic, not copper, but it is an attractive product. Mine is hanging on the front porch so the seeds stay dry, the squirrels can't jump onto it, and I can watch the birds from my kitchen window. The only assembly required is tapping the perches into place and screwing on the top."
1,"cheap ""copper"" colored plastic","I expected clear plastic tubes with real copper trim, a huge disappointment"
1,Bottom would not affix to the feeder. Very bad engineering,Bottom of feeder would not affix to the feeder. They sent me another one. It didn't work eitherVery bad engineering. Would not buy this product again. Wish I hadn't bought it in thefirst place.
5,BIRD FEEDER,I HAVE OWNED ONE OF THESE FOR ABOUT 15 YEARS THE TOP DETORIATED FROM THE SUN. THIS ONE LOOKS LIKE IT WILL LAST LONGER.
5,A good solid feeder,"We purchased this feeder to replace a 10 year old triple tube feeder of similar design. This one is solidly built and works as advertized. The real beauty of this feeder is the color and clean design. It looks much better in front of you than the picture can show - a pleasure to look at, and the birds are very happy with it as well. Cardinals, which are ground feeders, seem quite comfortable sitting on the bottom of this feeder where they wouldn't on the prior all-clear one before. A recommended product for bird lovers."
2,Did not last,"I got this feeder because of its capacity. I did not think it was squirrel proof when I bought it, but the squirrels trashed it. They pulled out the plastic pieces that can be set for different size seed, and pulled off one of the copper ""protectors"". Now when I fill it the seed, when the feeder is shaken, pours out of the openings. This feeder does not seem to last if there are squirrels. Other feeders we have are not squirrel proof, but have not been trashed.... -David"
2,false advertising,"This birdfeeder was advertised as a copper and it is copper colored plastic! The size was not given and it is larger than I would have wanted. Needless to say, I will not trust Amazon for anymore purchases unless I have actually seen the product somewhere else."
2,Not Very Durable,The bird feeder was damaged during shipping. The top frame holding the tubes wss cracked and several pieces broke off and were in the bottom of the box. The box did not show any signs of abuse. Makes you wonder how this feeder will hold up to a squirrel attack.
1,NOT squirrel proof!,"One of the advertised features of this feeder is that it does hold a large amount of seed. Unfortunately, if you have squirrels you'll find yourself refilling all three tubes at least every other day. The feeder has plastic coverings for the ports that swivel up and down to allow you to serve either a regular seed mix or nyger seed. The squirrels clawed off the coverings and I had to constantly re-attach them. (You can't fill the tubes without these covers because the seed will just poor out.) Three of the covers are now missing. I put this feeder up the first week in December and it went to the landfill Easter weekend. Now since this is an equal opportunity review I will tell you that the squirrels give the feeder high marks. They like the large dome that keeps them dry in the rain, and they especially like the tray that lets them sit while the dine. If you want a feeder that squirrels won't even look at try the Droll Yankee Whipper."
1,Not squirrel proof bird feeder,Pretty and sleek disign.Probably is normal that it took several weeks for birds to get acclaimated to use it.Squirrels have no problem climbing the pole to the seed. I bought it for the supossed anti squirrel properities.Cardinals and other big birds do not visit. It mostly attracts ordinar
2,Bird Feeder for feed the squirrel,"I was looking for a bird feeder that my bulimic squirrels do not empty in 2 seconds. I saw a beutifull 3 tubes feeder made of couper. This is mine!! I thought and I ask for it inmediately. First disappointment: no coupper; instead I found ""plastic"" poliuretane. I mounted it in a pole; at least I thought, my birds can eat the expensive food I bought for them. Well, the only live creatures in my bird feeder were ""squirrels"". The birds are scare of the shape of the bird-feeder. I dont know why. Maybe because it looks like a scarecrow with a hat. I put oil with pepper. My hangry squirrels run away but the scarecrow didnt attract my birds. I dont give up. I have not put seeds in the other bird feeders and I filled the coupper scarecrow with exquisite seeds. I hope that with this strategy, the plastic scarecrow will feed my cardinals."
2,not squirrel proof... see picture.,"Too bad this wasn't actually made out of copper... squirrels chewed a fist sized hole in the top (see photo posted). I'm going to try to salvage it somehow.Also, seeds get stuck in the part on the bottom between the base and tubes, causing them to sprout. I had a heck of a time cleaning that out - and it's not even all out."
3,perky-pet 7103-2 copper triple tube bird feeder,"The bird feeder is very plastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!! not copper, but the birds like it and holds a lot of bird seed"
2,looked good in the picture,"The size of this feeder was good. However it was described as copper and it is not. The picture made it look like it had a copper top and bands,but the top was plastic and so was the base. Not very sturdy. I returned it.(It was also damaged in shipping) Had it been made with copper it would have been a great feeder."
1,Give me a break,"Copper, more like plastic and a lot of it. That copper color you see in the picture, it's plastic and the only copper they have on the item is purely decorative. Don't waste your time or money."
4,non-copper triple tube bird feeder,"The word copper in the title sets up the consumer for big disappointment-it's simply the same old feeder in copper COLOR. Some of us naive sorts kinda thought maybe real copper (at that price!?) and therefore a little more squirrel proof. I support fat squirrels - fox squirrels from the east - as well as lots of birds. The squirrels nag at my two feeders and do a little damage, but mostly don't hurt them, the metal clad tubes at the feeding holes stops any beast from doing harm where it matters.Most of the damage has been from my dropping them a few dozen feet when the suspended wire gives out. Now they are patched up with wire, tape, replacement lower pans, but they still work.The feeder is just a little frail. If they made one with 4 or 5 or more tubes I'd buy it.As mine wear out, I will buy more."
1,Poor Service,"The company shipped a very damaged box (holes, tears, smashed and one roll of clear tape holding it together)with the product inside broken in 3 pieces. I've never had to contact Amazon over anything before. They stated this came from a different party. I explained that on the website it stated that it was sold by Amazon (no 2nd party). The company is refunding my money which I'm still waiting for. As for the product, it probably would've been very nice. It is quite large for a bird feeder and the copper looked pretty. Too bad. The UPS driver even said he was ashamed that he had to deliver it. :("
3,"Not Quite ""Copper""","The item is pretty, but it is a little misleading that it is called copper, when the majority of the construction is copper COLORED plastic.That kind of sucks."
3,Need contact information for Opus' Topflight,Does anyone have the contact information for this company? I have several feeders that broke on the bottom when the wind blew them off and I have not been able to find any contact information. I can't find the receipts but am hoping they will honor them anyway. Your help is appreciated!
1,Got full return on money paid,I was very disappointed in the feeder when it arrived. The box was torn and taped in several places also the feeder itself had several parts broken off. I notified the company and they asked me to return it with a comment as to why. I did so and requested a refund. In approximately 1-1/2 weeks I received an email my account was to be credited for the full amount. Very soon after the email I was able to confirm that the funds had been credited to my account.
5,Almost squirrel proof!,"This feeder is attractive, easy to fill, and popular with our birds. It has foiled all of our many squirrels except one little fellow who can jump over 10 feet from the grill cover to grasp the bottom tray. He comes back even after a direct hit with a BB gun!"
2,Holes too small,"It looks nice and basically works okay, but I think the holes are too small. The birds have trouble getting the seeds out and it discourages them. They will eat here only when other avenues are exhausted"
2,Mixed review,"Bird feeder is very attractive and my birds love it. Only problem is that after a little more than a month the bottom tray does not want to stay attached. Is already dropping down on one side and even though I tried to push it back up in place it will not stay. It is mounted on a pole out away from trees, etc. so that only birds can get to it."
2,Cheap squirrel feeder,"This product is almost a good one. The squirrels have learned that they are able to grab the lower ledge of the feeder as they fall past it from the top. They then proceed to chew the plastic seed doors off which then causes an avalanche of seeds as the entire feeder empties onto the ground. After a week this feeder is no longer usable as it no longer holds seed. A few improvements are needed: 1. Make the top baffle larger. This will prevent the squirrels from being able to grab the ledge as they fall past. 2. Make the seed doors out of metal to keep the squirrels from chewing them off. Make these changes and you could have a good feeder. As is, I would not buy again."
3,Birdfeeder purchased at Amazon.,"This bid feeder is very attractive, however it has a misleading name. It is not in fact a ""Copper"" bird feeder. It should have been listed as a ""Copper Colored"" bird feeder. And, the top part of the feeder was broken, probably in shipping since it was banging around in its shipping box. And the printed directions that came with the feeder states that the pole is included with the feeder, but was not included, and is listed as an optional purchase at about ten dollars. Since we did not need the pole, that was no problem for us. All in all, we found the feeder to be very attractive, and a good addition to our backyard bird feeding area, and the price was fair."
2,Copper-colored plastic,"I was expecting this to be a copper bird feeder - I was hoping to match my copper bird bath. Note that this is copper-colored plastic - *not* copper. If you don't mind the plastic, it seems like a nice bird feeder, but I chose to send it back."
1,Don't waste your money!,"There us very little copper on this ""copper bird feeder"". Don't kid yourself by thinking that the roof is made of copper, it is made of plastic. The only copper portions are the accents near the perches.This is definitely NOT squirrel-proof. The squirrels were able to easily jump up and sit on the bottom of the feeder, and even chewed through the feed holes next to the perches. Once they did that, the feeder is useless as the feed just pours out of the side of the feeder.If I could give it zero stars, I would. This definitely not worth the money. Keep looking for another feeder."
1,flimsy construction,* I would not recommend this bird feeder. The tubes that hold the food are fragile and the clips that hold the bottom tray to the feeding tubes are weak. I broke one of them the first time I removed the tray to clean the feed tubes.
1,false advertising - this is a cheap plastic feeder,"Imagine my surprise when I opened the box to find a PLASTIC contraption rather than the elegant copper one the description and photo lead me to believe. This is an unattractive, overly large feeder with a big brownish plastic dome on top. Yuk."
1,Defective Product Received...Twice!,"Sure looked like a good bird feeder for the price. Too bad I will never know more than that. First feeder I ordered and received was missing parts. Replacement feeder received was in pieces (broken). Reurned that one and now I understand Amazon is returning all remaining inventory to the manufacturer for replacement. Unsure if these problems occurred from manufacturer or after shipment from Amazon, but there was no indication of damage to any of the shipping boxes. You may want to wait a few weeks to order this item and pray the problem has been resolved."
1,Maybe I have monster squirrels?,"After just four months in our bird feeding station, this feeder has been destroyed by squirrels. I really don't mind that they quickly figured out how to access the seed ports. What I do mind is that they chewed through the plastic parts in the ports so that all the seed just pours out onto the ground. Very disappointed and would definitely not buy this one again."
3,"""Squirrel-Proof""?","I bought this feeder about 3 months ago, to replace another plastic squirrel -proof feeder that had broken due to wear & tear. While I didn't mind the copper-colored plastic (I wasn't expecting real copper at this price), I did mind that my local squirrels just jump off the top, down to the food tray and help themselves. I finally took the tapered dome cover from the old feeder and placed it on this one - a perfect fit and no more squirrels. It now has a somewhat hybrid appearance, but it's squirrel-proof. I would recommend buying the feeder for it's appearance and capacity, but I would look elsewhere if you are looking for ""squirrel-proof""."
5,Great feeder...but...,"This is an awesome feeder, they last for years and hold a lot of seed. This is my 4th one. I did have a problem with this last one I ordered. It arrived with the hanging hook not attached. I returned the it because I didn't own a tool that would reach up inside the long tube and when the replacement arrived it also had the hanging hook not attached. I ended up going to my neighbor's and he had a 6 inch long 1/4 inch socket and he got the hook screwed in for me."
5,Perky-Pet Copper Triple Bird Feeder,"I had one just like this bird feeder until racoons wrecked it!That's why I bought this one again...I love this bird feeder!!! It,along with the food attracts all kinds of birds!!! I highly recommend this bird feeder!!!"
1,What a rip-off!,"If I had read all the negative reviews of this feeder, I never would have purchased it. Be warned! Do Not Waste Your Money! I expected a sturdy feeder with copper ports, tray, and cover that would withstand the squirrels in our neighborhood. What a disappointment to discover that the only copper is the bands around the tubes. All the other ""copper"" is copper-colored plastic. I should have returned it, but needed a new feeder so I didn't. It's been up about a month, and the squirrels have already chewed off three of the plastic parts that shield the openings. As a result, the seed just pours out. Now my expensive ""copper"" feeder is patched with duct tape. What a rip-off!"
1,Plastic not copper..,"Very disappointing as well as misleading. The top baffle, as well as the bottom catch tray are made out of plastic,not copper. This was not at all clear from either the description or the photo."
4,Perky-Pet copper triple tube bird feeder,"I love the looks of this feeder..however, despite the fact that it shows the feeder hanging from trees, poles, etc. the screw that came with the feeder fits loosely in the top. There is no way to screw it into the feeder or fasten it to the feeder. In the ad, I did not read that it can only be used with the pole??? If there is a part missing or I am not putting it together correctly, Please let me know as I ordered it to hang from a tree. Thank You"
5,I am happy with my purchase,"I like being able to use 3 different feeds in the feeder. It's large capacity tubes mean less time filling it, more time enjoying the birds."
5,Still going strong since 2006,"I really love that this feeder holds so much seed. We have put it under the eaves near the window so the cats can watch all the action. I am going to purchase another, since we've built up a community of finches, cardinals, titmice, juncos, grosbeaks, sparrows, mourning doves, blue jays, downy woodpeckers, chickadees, and indigo buntings that depend on it throughout the year. What an amazing experience!"
2,looking 4 a sucker?,"With no description, this is a joke right? $$$ looks just like others and half the cost. So without other information, you appear to have priced yourself out of the market"
4,"For the ""Bird Lover""",This is a Christmas gift for the bird lover of the family.This is a Christmas gift for the bird lover of my family.
1,Choose something else,"I think Willard is just another grunge band without any kind of idea of what music is.Go to look for other bands from Seattle and Washington State,inside ""grunge minor choices"" you can find better stuff choosing Gravel,My Name,Skin Yard(even if Steel Mill is produced by Jack Endino),Blood Circus,Seaweed."
2,Boredom?Maybe,"This album is not bad,but it's very boring.Except for ""High Moon"" and ""Sweet Kali"".The first seems a song made by Tool,the guitars has same effects of Adam Jones guitar on Aenima.If you're not afraid of boredom,you can buy it."
5,the kensington pilotboard,"I am typing this review on my new kensington pilotboard. it is a very nice keyboard, and I love it. the forward/back buttons next to the mouse wheel are very nice, and incredibly useful! (I hate having to go up to the top of my browser to go back) a wonderful keyboard."
2,"They ALL will plug into a Mac, but...","You really need the two extra ports on the keyboard for it to be truly a Mac Keyboard. Ever wonder why PC mice have such an impossibly long cord? It's because PC mice have to plug into the back of the computer, wherever it may be. You can tell a Mac mouse by its short cord, and a Mac keyboard by its USB ports. This is another afterthought keyboard. I'm going for the MacAlly products to see if they meet my needs better."
2,Had this phone for 4 years until it just stopped working.,4 years is not very long. I called AT&T on-line troubleshooting but they simply reiterate whats already in in the user manual and remind me its out of warranty.AT&T usually makes excellent products. Not this time.
1,That is a bad movie !,This is a bad movie. All scenes are funny and stupid. I do not like that kind of Chinese joke in this film. It is dirty and does not make any sense. I regreted to buy it.
1,not the cynthia rothrock movie,"I bought the movie and had to return it because it is not the Yes Madam with Cynthia Rothrock in it. This is some stupid english dubbed movie that makes no sense at all and is very ignorant. If your looking for Cynthia, look some where else this is not the right movie."
3,are you sure thats a 685?,i love this receiver but the one pictured doesnt look like mine. i have two additional channels and the front controls are pretty different
5,GREAT PRINTER,"I JUST BOUGHT THIS PRINTER FOR MY LAPTOP.IT WAS VERY EASY TO INSTALL AND EASY TO WORK WITH. THE PRINTING IS GREAT, AND QUICK FOR A BUBBLE JET. THE COLOR IS VERY GOOD."
1,"Great album, terrible MP3 download system","Great album but buyer beware, the Amazon.com download system is terrible. It took two contacts with customer service to get the album downloaded. If you make any mistakes during the purchase/download process or if there's an Internet hiccup during a download attempt, you have to contact customer service before you can attempt the download again. Even after two customer service contacts and a day later, I ended up having to download each song individually. What a pain."
3,Still Itchy,"My dog has flea allergies, but doesn't normally get fleas. She came with me to visit family and picked up some fleas while we were there. Treated and got rid of the fleas, but she was still miserable and itchy. I ordered this hoping it would help soothe her. It got her clean, she smelled good and her hair was soft, but she was just as itchy as she was before. I followed the instuctions exactly and even gave it several days and tried again and it still did not seem to help her much. I'll continue to use it as a regular shampoo for her since I have it."
3,Smell good !!,"Is good but didn't work for what i need it!! , but i apply and my dogs smell really good"
5,Up-beat modernist guitar disc,If you don't know Lou Harrison's music that is lively and effusive in its essence try this disc! I have played it many times and find it continually rewarding.
2,Thin,"Colin Martin has clearly been through Hell and lived to tell the tale. Unfortunately the book does not do justice to his ordeal as it is totally lacking in detail, reflection, conclusions and insights. As an example he does not reveal how he makes money in the jail (refused to work, so no income there), nor does he describe in detail his relationship with the other inmates, family in Ireland, colleagues or other people around him.It is an easy read and will not take up much of your time, but if you have alternatives, use them."
2,Very disappointing for old fans!,"For a band who started out as an innovative synth rock duo in the '70s this is truly a very poor album. It sounds like Depeche Mode's ""A broken frame"" or Pet Shop Boys' ""Please"" robbed of all good melodies. Even Alan Vega's unpredictable and manic vocals, which added so much energy and drive to their earlier albums, have gone into boring talk-singing. The best songs are the title tracks and ""Flashy love"", the rest is not memorable. ""Why be blue"" was released in 1992, but that's simply unbelievable, because the music sounds like being made in the early-'80s. Why did they release such a bland and uninspired album? I suppose they've run out of money. If you wanted to know what Suicide really is about, buy their self-titled debut album!"
5,Beautiful and comfortable,"I bought these in the walnut color, and love them! The leather is a nice, medium weight- stiffer than kid, but not excessively stiff. I ordered up half a size to get the width I need across the ball of my foot, and am glad I did. After wearing these boots for 15 hours straight, I wasn't in a big hurry to get out of them, and that's unusual for me. The arch support is moderate and the toe box is roomy (the toe isn't real pointy, measuring about 1 & 3/4 inches wide at the tip). One thing I especially like is that the boots are nicely ""finished"" inside, and don't snag my nylons as some boots do."
1,size is too big for calves,"i like how it looked on the internet and fell in love with it when i saw it after delivery. however, it was way too big for my calves. like it was 2 times bigger than it should be. the sizing for my feet is ok, but this is made for people with big calves. i am small but not skinny. the boots even has some elastic fabric panels around it, which i think isn't necessary for it is really way too big. i was really upset because the boots really looked so nice and sexy, (love the shape and heels) but i look like a 5 year old wearing my mom's shoes! i gave it to my mother in law (and she was so happy) because i got it with free shipping and i am losing a lot anyways. won't order again if not sure about the size! shoes not made for smaller built people!"
5,Logistically true and lots of fun,"This is anime that is lots of fun to watch. While not logistically perfect, it has a lot of sound Submarine tactics and is a gas to watch. Worth a watch if not a purchase. I felt it was worth a buy..Maybe you will too."
3,yo yo girl cop,"it seems a bit choppy in some instances,but the fighting in the very beginning was top notch."
4,"well done, though a little campy","Submarine 707 is a decent anime movie, apparently taken from the series, that has yet to be released in the US in its entirety... It is a little campy, but still fun to watch...Two missions by the 707 attached to the peace keeping navy fighting their nemesis the UX...The movie leaves you hanging because no more have been released."
5,Bird Watcher,"I bought this bird feeder for my own yard. I just made a small bird area and this feeder was perfect. Nice and streamlined, not bulky and overbearing for this small area of landscaping. The birds were visiting this feeder the first day. I used the seed recommendations that came with the feeder. I am using oil sunflower seeds and the birds really like it. I like this feeder because I can put almost any type of seed in it and attract different birds. Good product."
2,Definetly not MERV 12 filters at so-so quality.,"These are decent air filters, but due to the appearance of the media I'm 100% sure that these are not MERV 12 air filters. The media look just like my MERV 8 filters, but really bothers me since they advertise them as MERV 12. To top it off, nowhere in the filter or the box there is a MERV rating. Very suspicious indeed... Also, I have a Honeywell air filter system in my house and these filters are just a tad too small. They do not seal perfectly and the filter was actually on top of one of the feedramps that keeps the filter in place. I did not measure the sides, but this filter is definitely not within the specification parameters. If I can get these at about 1/2 price of similar MERV 8 filters I might buy them again. If they are just a couple of dollars less than a more reputable filter I would definitely stay away from them and I recommend you do, too."
1,DID NOT RECEIVE COMPLETE ORDER BUT BILLED ANYWAY,THE FILTERS ARE GREAT BUT -- I ONLY RECEIVED 6 THEN 1 WITH 5 NOT RECEIVED. BUT I WAS BILLED RIGHT AWAY FOR COMPLETE ORDER.
3,Mediocre third party product,"I bought this product because of the price for what seemed like an equivalent product to the Honeywell or AAF (American Air Filter) product. But it a poor cousin. It is cheaper, but what you get is less as well. Note the key differences compared to the AAF product:1 - It is thinner: 3-5/8 inches versus 4-3/8 inches.2 - It has only 13 folds of the filter versus 18.It all adds up to less filtration surface. Pay less, get less. I'll buy the AAF or Honeywell next time."
5,size does matter,"originally bought a 20x25x4 filter from a local hardware store & did notfit my odd sized air handler,(trane) bought these filters due to the exactmeasurement & all is well again. price was also lower & shipping wasfast!"
5,"Good quality, great price.","Excelent filtration capabilities. Long service life in regular household environments.Also of note, filter frame is strong and sturdy, compared to others."
5,Roach's finest hour,The soundscapes Steve Roach creates on Dreamtime Return are out of this world. They'll grab you instantly and by the time this double-disc set comes to an end you'll be amazed and stunned by it. This is Roach in his finest hour and it's definitely the finest hour of ambient music. This is a must have for every ambient music fan....
1,If you want to get bored...,"Maybe I'm ignorant about electronic music, but I've heard a lot of symphonic rock and new age, and I can hardly denominate ""music"" to this CD. Poor recording quality adds to what is a mistake in my collection."
5,Good Video.,The best video ever. Something that everyone should buy for those whom like Tenchi sagas.
4,Really GOOD!!,"This a somewhat mysterious album by Gary.It was released originally only in Japan and, altough the release date is often mentioned as being 1984, I think that 1984 was the year when it was released in England, because I think it was recorded before talbuns like CORRIDORS OF POWER (1982) and VICTIMS OF THE FUTURE (1983).AS for the album, it has Gary playin his fiercest solos ever, great skill, great technic, great feeling, THe guy is a monster guitarrist, underappreciated in the United States."
3,"A sweet, fluffy read, like cotton candy. Not bad!","I enjoyed this book, but the authors need to further hone their writing skills. Not bad, just not fantastic. A nice beach read, in the style of ""Bridget Jone's Diary"" and ""The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing,"" (which I've also read and also feel similarly about). I was impressed by how much heart this book shows at the end, however!I'm being a little hard on this book because I read it right after reading two mind-blowing books, ""Atonement"" and ""The Moth Diaries."" Two books that awed me."
4,Very funny,"I found this book extremely funny - and I could even picture the characters - but left me with lots of questions: why take everything that the worst couple of humans alive would drop on your shoulders, wasn't ""loving Grayer"" just a pretext to continue writing about it, why being so negative and complain about what's going on instead of doing something about it, etc etc"
4,A quick read with bite!,"I loved the book and was amazed to think that it had been written by two friends as the writing doesn't have a fragmented feel at all. The story is entertaining, the characters memorable. These authors really ""get"" kids, and even if you don't like their satirical take on rich Manhattan mommies, you will probably be able to empathize with little Grayer, whose hunger for parental attention is palpable.I, too, found it hard to take Nan's spineless acceptance of her poor treatment by the X adults, but enjoyed the book despite its (few) faults."
5,Funny and inspiring,"The Nanny Diaries is about Nanny, a 21-year-old single girl living in New York City who works part-time as a nanny while attending NYU. Nanny then becomes the nanny for Grayer, the only child of the X family. While Nanny is taking care of Grayer, Mr. and Mrs. X begin to have marital problems. Nanny is absolutely driven out of her mind between taking care of Grayer, completing Mrs. X's orders, and completing her course at NYU.This book is so unique because the authors actually were nannies. This better enables a more truthful account of what it is like to be a nanny. The different situations that Nanny is put into are quite funny, and in the end, touching. I couldn't put this book down at all!! It is an absolute must-read for anybody looking for a summer book to take along to the beach."
3,I keep asking Why?,"The Nanny Diaries was an entertaining and interesting story - peroid. I expected more of a thrilling ploy and plot, however it ended in a very predicatble manner. At the end I couldn't help but feel like asking the questions why? and what else? I guess it's up to me to make that determination. I felt that some of the characters could have been a little more developed and at some points in the book the storyline seemed to drag and get a little dull. Overall, The Nanny Diaries makes a good summertime read."
4,Entertaining and Insightful,"This book brilliantly captures that subculture we love to hate: the selfish rich who abdicate their parenting responsibilities to women they pay poorly and treat like garbage. The authors provide us with fascinating studies in self-absorption in their characterizations of the employers-from-Hell in this story, and with a sympathetic and interesting protagonist with whom we can identify on every level. The authors are astute observers of life, in particular ""family"" life on the Upper East Side of New York City."
2,I love Julia normally?,Listening about the cretins inhabiting this account and read by the somewhat perplexingly annoying voice of Julia Roberts I had to give up after 2 tapes. It was just grating on me that much. I just couldn't flog my ears another minute with these people and that voice. Sorry Julia..love your movies and your smile!
2,Horribly depressing story if you have kids,"Picked it up thinking it was supposed to be a comedy based on seeing reviews for it on TV (can't even imagine a movie option as was being discussed). It was well written. Enough about that. It obviously evoked a reaction in me. As a mother of two, I sobbed at the thought of such unloving, manipulative parents. I know the characters are fictious, but paint a horrible picture of what the ""good life"" is. Makes you happy for what you have if you know how to take care of it. I really would not care for a sequel or movie version. It would be awful to remake a ""Mommy Dearest"" from the nanny's point of view."
4,Compelling take on Upper East Side Life,"I found this book to be a interesting look on the life and styles of some of New Yorks Rich. Although at times a little slow, it kept my interest the whole ways through showing that no matter how much money you have, in some things you are still incredibly poor, event though you pretend you're happy. The contrast between Nanny's family life and that of her employers was huge, even though they have ""everything""."
3,Twisted!,This is a hilariously dark twisted book. If you have a dark sense of humor you will enjoy this book!
3,Biting and probably true,"Nanny diaries has the ring of truth to it. I found it sad, AND I read it to the bitter end, because it was engaging. Many of the characters in the book are immensely self involved people, and the pain generated by their way of living was the depressing part. Not everyone would be as sensitive to the picture of life portrayed, I suspect."
4,"good read, not great!","Surviving my own experience as a nanny, I was anxious to read ""The Nanny Diaries"". While I found some great truthes in the relationship between Nanny and Mr. and Mrs. X, (being smushed in a car with screaming kids while seemingly being ignored by the ""adults"" in the car was priceless) I felt the characters onesided and harsh. Though we see cracks in the crust of Mrs. X, I never really cared about her or Nanny. I did cry over the lack of a daddy for the little boy. I spent many days and nights nursing hurts, loving as though they were my own, and Nanny showed the deep cracks and differences between caring for and owning a child as the X's did. Its a good traveling book, because thinking is an option. Its truth and humor and I'll admit some tears. Childcare workers will see themselves in it, but outsiders might wonder what evil parents exist in big cities and why no one does anything to stop them."
5,What a delightful book!,"This book is a funny must-read. Once you begin, you find yourself flipping the pages, unable to stop! Being a mother of three, I was tickled...I laughed because I could certainly relate to the words I was reading! You'll finish this in two... three days tops, and you'll be glad you took the time! This is a very funny, enlightening experience!"
4,"Easy, Fun Read.","This was one of those books that's perfect for a beach or airplane. The story really moves along and you care about Nanny and poor little rich boy Grayer, who really only wants him mom and dad to pay attention to him. The Nanny Diaries takes you to a world you might not know about and makes the journey a blast. While I was reading it I was really surprised by one aspect. I live in a very wealthy suburban area in a mid-western city. While many people have nannies, Prada shoes and all the other accoutraments of what is appearently upper class New York, here NO ONE(not even the richest society woman) would ever have the Nanny take or pick up their child from school. That is the domain of the Mom, who want the teachers to think that she is a good and involved mother. Even if the mom takes her little one right home to the Nanny immediately thereafter!..."
2,Could have been so much better,"This book is a must for those who farm out their children to nannies and day care workers. It is also a must for real moms who raise their children. Those who have nannies raising their children may just finally realize that it takes more than ""stuff"" to be a mother and those at home with their children will rest assure that they are doing the right thing. The book would have been much better if the characters were given believable names and if it was maybe in a journal format that exposed the feelings of the nanny more clearly."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"This was such a great book for several reason - it was a quick read, but also addictive (I stayed in bed til noon on my day off because I couldn't stop reading!). The story was well written, clever, funny and kept me interested throughout. It also made me a little sad to realize that there is probably more than one family that could fit the description of the family in the book. I definitely recommend this one!"
2,"Great concept, poor execution","The nanny-authors attempt a contemporary version of the life of the governess, set in the upscale high-rise apartments of New York's Upper East Side. (Excerpts from nannies of past literature -- Mary Poppins, Jane Eyre, Gone with the Wind, etc. -- are the best feature of the book.) But they fall short in the opportunity for a modern classic, due to terrible writing and confusing tones of satire, disdain, and sentimentality.I can't decide whether to categorize it as (bad)""comedy"" as some reviewers have called it, or (bad) social commentary. In any case it's satire that loses control by being at times, too ridiculous (the scenes in Nantucket), or too sappy (the sorrows of the other house servants).I'd like to read a book that tells the same story with a sharp, witty, satirical edge OR one that exposes the heart-breaking sadness of kids with self-centered absent parents. The authors tried to achieve both in one book and failed twice."
1,Like one of those Frothe commercials,"This book is littered with cliche and expected situational comedy. It is almost like a screen play - the character banter is so predictable, you can skip several pages at a time and still be stuck in the same scenario. I feel sorry for everyone involved in this book, but mostly for the Nanny. She went to a glorified baby sitting job the night of her college graduation! Hopefully Nanny Diaries II will come out, Nanny will get gusty and finally tell the Xes to kiss her well-educated rear end."
1,What was the point of this book??,"After hearing all the buzz on this book I was quite excited to read it.. and once I finished I was wondering why? What was the point of this book! To show how a twenty-something year old woman can be pushed around by a snobby rich woman! I think Nanny is a weak character and I couldn't believe she or anyone would put up with the X family . I kept reading thinking something good would come out of the book, however when the X's made a fuss about her graduation and leaving for vacation etc.. the writers had gone too far! The writers made it seem that Nanny was staying for Grayer, but yet the end could not have been more tragic for him.. leaving in the middle of the night with Grayer screaming for her??? and Nanny takes the puppy?? WHAT? I would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"Could. Not. Put. It. Down. Literally. I found myself rearranging my schedule just so I could keep reading.I don't know if it was the quirky and easy flow of the writing or my sheer amazement at the idea that such people exist that kept me glued to the pages, but either way, a complete delight. I could not recommend this novel more.My only criticism is the ending. Though true to life, it does leave some loose ends.To Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus - please, please, please write more!"
1,Don't understand what all the fuss is about,"Nanny Diaries is pretty stinky. It was sad and horrifying to see how these supposed ""parents"" (merely the sperm and egg donors; they don't actually parent at all) act with their kids. In a way you can't help but read on, like rubbernecking to catch a glimpse of a horrible car accident, but you really shouldn't bother.... There is really not much story-wise to this novel. Like another reviewer said, there isn't any character development. It just ends. There was way too much profanity for me (the f-word has no purpose or meaning other than being a horribly crass and ineffectual way of expressing oneself).It's a waste of a read; I wish I had just quit reading. If you feel you must partake, check it out from the library."
2,Disturbing and overrated,"Another book marketed as funny that is just plain disturbing. If you like reading about little children being neglected by self-absorbed parents and rich employers abusing their financially-desperate employees, you'll think this book is a real hoot."
2,"get it from the library, if at all","This is not a book to spend your money on. Though I thought it was an entertaining and quick read, but it was disappointing. The device of using anonymous ""names"" for the main characters annoyed me, as did Nanny who always seemed eager to be the brunt of mistreatment. There were several times I thought, ""Really, this would be such an easy situation to remedy! Why doesn't she just . . . ?"" But, Nanny always pulled through with a stupid decision that pulled her more directly into her unsavory situation. Really, her decisions were so bad and seemingly unrealistic, I could not root for her. But, if you need something that's not too challenging and a bit entertaining, check this our from the library. I'm glad I didn't spend my money on it."
2,Underwhelmed,I was looking forward to this book as it was put in the same genre and Confessions of a Shopaholic and Bridget Jones. I enjoyed the book up until the end. Its almost like the author ran out of time to finish the ending.
3,a big disappointment,"I thought this was supposed to be a funny, lighthearted look at the world of being a nanny to the social elite. The story follows a college student working as a nanny for a young boy whose parents are members of the social elite. The majority of the stories revolve around the parents having little time or interest in their son and the poor treatment of the nanny. The nanny finds herself in several predicaments, but never speaks up for herself. I found that VERY annoying as it went on and on. The nanny complains about the way she is treated, but doesn't do anything to try to resolve the problem."
2,"Nanny, defend yourself!","Nanny Diaries...a collection? Not! It's just one long story about a strong-willed NYU Child Development Major who works part-time as a nanny ... just happens her name is Nan. The paradox is that she cowers to her despicable employers who treat her like dirt. By the middle of the book, you're so sick of the situations, that you want Nan to tell Mrs. X to shove it and move on. That's the only reason for finishing the book...if you want to save time, just go from the middle to the last few pages. Oh, the authors felt the need to make Nan a smoker - this doesn't fit Nan's overall character at all - just Hollywood's uncreative symbol for frustration!"
1,Over-hyped Nonsense,"I'm sure that there is a good idea buried in this book, I just feel that it wasn't excuted well. A Nanny named Nanny and employers named Mr. and Mrs. X-like this was some attempt to protect real people. My problem is that in the 2 YEARS that it's taken me to read this book, is that the humor (if one wants to call it that) is at first in the begining too over the top and then the rest of the book severely lacking. Maybe this was to be a modern version of Agnes Grey-another book that sets out to complain about the previlege of the rich while the help CHOOSES to be of their employ. It's a book without a cohensive plot but has milked a lot of mileage off it's commerical title. Skip this one."
2,Ugh!,"I wouldn't say that this book is a waste of paper, but it is far from great literature. This book is basically about self-absorbed half-wits who are incapable of loving others. None of the characters in this book is really like-able, including the main character, the oh-so-cleverly named ""Nanny."" That being said, it is a good book for beach reading, though you are more likely to throw it in the ocean when you are done rather than on your bookshelf."
1,Annoying book,This book was very annoying. The main character was a weak and passive person who didn't seem to have a mind of her own. I don't think the personality of the main character was thought out well and written well. The plot just dragged on and the ending was very disappointing. There was no wit to this book.
2,More like the Ninny diaries,"This book was touted as a tell-all insider's take on the 'other half.' The central character, Nan, becomes unnaturally obsessed with someone else's four year old child, whose mundane activities are chronicled in painful detail. This obsession then extends to the philandering of her employer's husband. Nan also harbours growing resentment for her employers' position in life yet allows them to treat her like a doormat, which fuels her resentment. She was a pitiful character that really made this book a sad study of her pathetic life."
2,More could have been done with such ripe material,"The best thing about this book is its subject matter. Unfortunately, the writing is so amateurish it made me wince at times. Also, contrary to what some of the reviews say, the authors do not always ""get the details right."" Furthermore, they should have worked harder at making the narrator a little more three-dimensional, a little less high-minded and admirable (likewise her oh-so-lovable yet totally faceless parents and grandmother). I found excruciating the sections in which the narrator encounters nannies from less privileged backgrounds and lets us know that -- wait! you'll never guess! -- they are people, too. This revelation seems very self-congratulatory on the part of the authors. It may be news for some, but not for the rest of us."
2,So-so,I enjoyed the book but found the BEVERLY HILLS TUTOR to be much for enjoyable. The BEVERLY HILLS TUTOR added a better sense of surpise and mystery the nanny diaries simply lacked. I recommend the BEVERLY HILLS TUTOR over this one anyday.
3,Good- But Not Funny,"I have just finished reading this book. It was written very well, however, I went into it thinking it was to be funny, and was thoroughly dissapointed to find that it was not. I found the relationship between H.H. and ""Nanny"" confusing and undifined. What, she doesnt know his name, the sleep together, and then just call each other now and then? I also found the naming to be a bit odd. Let me see if I get this- the Nannys name is 'Nanny?'And the X family?? It all seemed rather odd to me.I really did like this book, just because I really feel that it helps define how a genre of adults can put their children aside, using them only for the christmas photos to promote the family vibe.By the end of the last 50 pages I was in tears for Grayer, Nanny takes his dog and doesnt say goodbye to the child who loves her, and is loved only by her? Hmm...I hope that this book can help some families like that to straighten out and get real."
1,Unreadable Pap,"It is disheartening that such a shallow, smug, self-congratulatory, artificial, hackneyed, tricked-up, hyped piece of junk has such a large, enthusiastic audience. I think that speaks volumes about the audience."
3,"Fast read, but...........annoying character after a while!!!","OK, the book started out pretty well, and the middle was even good but towards the middle/end you get really annoyed with the main character for allowing people to walk all over her and harrass her, and you begin to realize that in real life NO ONE could just sit back and take it without so much a word!! It lacked conflict in that sense."
2,Nanny the Victim,"I set out really wanting to like this book. I might have enjoyed it if the main character ""Nanny"" didn't play the victim in almost every situation. Nanny really needs to get a backbone. I thought she would finally get one by the end. Didn't happen. Maybe she will in the movie version. I don't understand why she (or anyone, for that matter) would put up with being spoken to in such a demeaning way. Maybe if she had told the X's off and then called Child Protective Services to report their neglect of their son, I would have a more favorable review."
2,Deceiving advertising,"This book was very disappointing to me. It is advertised as humerous, but I did not find anything funny about it and I can't imagine who would. It is a sad, frustrating story that leaves you very unsettled. The authors make you fall in love with the little boy in the book and does not provide any resolution for his horrible situation. You also get so frustrated with Nanny and what she puts up with. The ending was very abrupt and unsatisfying. Not an enjoyable read."
3,It was OK,"Wasn't thrilled with the book. I had heard wonderful things - people raving about this book & with the movie coming out, I couldn't wait to read it. But it wasn't as great as I had antisipated, nor as great as people had let me to believe. It was OK - took me a while to get into it. Then I thought it kind of ended abrubtly. But it was OK. Amusing at times to see what Nan had to put up with, but not alot in it to keep me coming back for me. It actually took me a while to finish."
3,a little too dark,"I read this book expecting to get a good laugh, but instead found a very dark tale about a girl who discovers the struggles of being a nanny for New York high society. While the novel is very well written and quickly grabs one's interest, I didn't find the book at all funny. If you're looking for an amusing story, you're not going to find it here."
4,All Too True(I'm afraid),"Having worked in child care,I have experienced some the aspects of what is portrayed in this story. The strangeness of parents who want to make their children little extensions of themselves is a sad fact. The authors do make it funny,thank gawd,and the boy seems like a real child,not some wise-cracking sitcom brat. I related to ""Nanny's"" ambivelent feelings about working so hard and receiving so little apprecation for it.Mostly because she bonded with her small charge and thought maybe,she could get through to his parents that he was desparate for their love,not what they could buy him. A sad/funny story that will make you both laugh and nod in empathy if you've ever worked with children.."
2,"Interesting concept, boring book.","As a teacher and former child care provider I too know the waycertain paretns can treat their child's caregiver, and their childfor that matter. The concept is great, but the story lacks imagination and is not very absorbing."
2,yawn,"it sounded fun, and there was a lot of hype... I think I did laugh once but my only motivation to continue reading it was hoping that it all became worthwile somewhere. It never did."
2,For Kid Lovers,"The Nanny Diaries is a quick and easy read. It offers insight into the goings on of the rich New York Park Ave set. If you have ever walked by a brownstone or high rise in New York and wondered what kind of person lived there, this may be interesting to you.The issue I had with the book is that I personally could never imagine persuing or having a job as a nanny. I like kids, but at a distance, so I was constantly thinking--QUIT this job! I certainly would not put up with everything that Nanny (the main character) did in order to keep such a grueling job. I also did not find Grayer (the child in the novel) a very endearing character. I did not see the bond that was keeping Nanny there as his nanny. I felt sorry for the often neglected boy, but I can't imagine staying in that situation for so long for someone else's kid.In short, if you are in the child care field, you will love this. If you are not so baby/kid crazy, this is not your sort of read."
2,Sorry I wasted my time and $,"When I hit page 100, I started to skim the rest of this book. Usually by page 100, scenarios have been set up to pay off with something really outrageous or interesting. But all this one does is PLOD along page after page of what Mrs X does to her (if-I-don't-go-along-with-the-group-and-have-a-kid-even-though-I-don't-really-want-one-but-I'll-be-regarded-weird-if-I-don't ) child/pet. Yes, it is pathetic, all these women in the kid's life (no men, I wonder what affect that will have on him later) micro-managing everything he wears/eats/touches, yet psychologically ignoring him except the nanny, who is not allowed to really discipline him and has to watch Grayer become a spoiled rich brat.To be honest,I can't remember what I've read, truly, and probably won't remember the rest of the book IF I can finish it.I should have listened to all of you who panned it."
2,The back cover said something about REVENGE???,"Although the back cover hints at it...There is no revenge in this book.Nanny is so spineless it's frustrating. I practically had an ulcer while reading it. I kept waiting for release-Nanny's eventual come-uppance against the horrible Mrs. X. But it never happened. It left me highly unsatisfied.And Nanny is constantly complaining about her job to anyone who will listen, her friends family, boyfriend. But she never quits!"
3,nanny nightmare,"While I enjoyed the novel the ending left me wanting and very disappointed. I too expected Nan to finally ""give it to "" Mrs. X, and the fact that she was underpaid by $1,400.00 and did nothing -that burned me up. She merely allowed herself to be kicked out and left at the train station at night with the X's unwanted dog. I expected her to tell Mrs. X exactly what she thought AND to wake Grayer to say good bye, at least to yell goodbye when awoke and called out for her. Overall the ending ruined the book for me... this the second book that left me feeling that the author just got tired. I hope this is not the new trend."
2,why bother,I kept asking myself why I was bothering to read this book. I guess the answer was that I was on a boat. Why anyone would feel it was ok to put up with the abuse that was ladled out to Nanny is a mystery. Aside from Greyer you feel sorry for no one. I did finish it because I always finish books I have gotten half way through and because I didn't have anything else to read. The blurbs on the cover stating that it is absolutely side splitting was stupid. Any reviewer who stated that should be fired.
5,Absolutley moving,"This book was absolutley awesome. I managed to read one hundered pages of it in about an hour and a half, I simply could not put it down. The ""Nanny Diaries"" really exploits wealthy families and shows what most people believe is happening, actually is. I hope that someone can help me find a book as fabulous as this one. I hope that we see a sequel soon because I am absolutley on the edge of my chair, not knowing what happens with H.H. and Grover. Anyone would love this book, I recommend it to ALL readers of teens and up. It has almost knocked Catcher and the Rye off my top favorite book."
3,"If you have a young child, do not read The Nanny Diaries.","It is a good book. Well-written, well-plotted, etc. But it starts out light and silly, about those foolish wealthy people who hire nannies (I was even reading choice bits to my husband at the beginning,) and then turns into a downward spiral of Nanny being the only one who ever expressed affection to the poor 4-year-old boy. Culminating in a scene of as his vapid and distant socialite mother firing Nanny for imagined and self-absorbed reasons, as he sobbed and screamed, locked in his room, for her to come back. Read it later, when your kids are much older."
4,Storyline jumps a little but GOOD overall,The story is a good one. I liked it and could not put it down.
3,Could use a good editor and a little less exaggeration,"I was a nanny for 11 months and recognized some of the characters in this book. The writing itself was poor and I couldn't believe the characters were named ""Nanny"" and ""Mr and Mrs X"" (and who could forget Ms Chicago!) which, in my opinion, is unimaginative. I got frustrated with Nanny's spinelessness but can complete understand how she could get sucked in to this family and pretty soon was doing all sorts of things not related to child care. Overall, this book was ok but definitely could have been better. Those who have not been nannies may think the situations were contrived but I think they rang true (though slightly exaggerated)."
3,Review Number 189,"The subject matter is good, certainly kept me up much to late and the coffee the next morning didn't do DIDLY! Ok, so the authors don't really have a style, and it ooozzzes in write-for-a-hobby style. The girls are genius' in one sence... they know how to get the middle-class entertained, by dangling the silly lives of the upper-class in front of us. It did do one thing which I think was worth the price of the book... it made me feel good about my home-cooked meals and the hands-on time I spend with my 4-year old, 24 hours a day!!! REAL WOMEN DON'T NEED NANNIES!"
1,Terrible! Poor Writing Style!,"This book was word for word the exact replica of one that I had read when I was in the SECOND GRADE! Of course that was 21 years ago and the title of that book escapes me, but I do remember it being far better written then this time waster. The only reason that I bothered finishing the ""Nanny Diaries"" was in amazement as to exactly how similar the older book and this one had in common.Not to mention the several errors! I realize that this book was not meant to be a manual for brain surgery, but for a fun and quick read, but please! A complete insult to my intelligence! A reality t.v. show would have been far better entertainment!"
3,Pretty Good!,I thought this was a pretty good book. I did find myself wanting the main charecter to stand up to her boss and tell her off but she never really did. The was a funny book and I really hope the author will come out with some other books. I would love to read some thing else by them.
3,"Interesting, but a one-time read","The main character, only known as ""Nanny"", tells the story of her employment as a caregiver for the only son of Mr. and Mrs. X. The theme seems to be very one-note: the ""haves"" are selfish, egotistical, materialistic and snobbish to the ""have nots"". It's not a horrible read, but it isn't the type of book you want to read over and over."
3,justanopinion,"Compared to other recent books of its ""genre"" such as Wedding Season and The Right Address, Nanny Diaries beats them out with seemingly more accurate descriptions of ""society"". Furthermore, it is a better and easier read, more captivating and more thought provoking. Buy or borrow!"
3,Good satire,"The narrative in the first person present and the ""on-the-inside"" New York references left me disoriented at the beginning. As the novel progressed and the characters developed, I steadily gained interest and found the writing elegant and skilful. The names--Mrs. X, Mr. X., Nan, Nanny--were no doubt chosen to lend a tell-all and universal theme flavor, but I think the characters would have worked better with real names. A bit more physical description might not have gone amiss either. I felt captivated by Grayer's character, but I did not have a clear visual of him. Like all good satire, ""The Nanny Diaries"" makes a social point. The ending is very poignant. Be prepared to cry if you love children."
5,I can't remember when I laughed so hard,"I swear this book was written about my former boss. She was Mrs. X to a T, from having a very busy day (doing what?) to stocking the pantry with organic everything. Her nanny was forever asked to do some of the things that Nanny in the book is and then Mrs. X would get exasperated about not being able to find competent help. This is the kind of book you shouldn't read before going to bed, it's too funny and you'll never be able settle down to sleep."
1,I can't believe I read the whole thing!,"I understand that this is supposedly based on real people and real experiences, names and likenesses changed, etc., and that only furthers my opinion that this is a self indulgent exercise in journal writing. Rule number one: not everything that happens that is interesting to you will translate into interesting reading. It just tries too hard. I could not help but to imagine the authors as disgruntled sorority girls with martyr complexes, which I might have overlooked had I at least been able to laugh, but I could only feel annoyed. I want a refund."
2,Mildly entertaining,I bought this book after seeing the two authors on a talk show and was intrigued. I thought this would be a tell all look into the world of high society with gossip and some funny stories. What I got was a poorly written book with a main charachter I felt nothing for.There isnt any depth to any one of these charachters. You feel nothing for anyone. I didnt care how poorly they treated the nanny cause I didnt know her well enough to like her. Which is really how you feel about every person in this story.It was a book that I forced myself to finish as I had to buy it in hardcover and was more pricey than most books I buy.I hear they are making it into a movie which I hope they change a lot of the story to make it interesting.Skip it.
2,What a letdown,"Simply put, if I'm going to read what basically amounts to a best-seller trifle, I demand satisfaction. I want resolution and comeuppance and happy endings. This ain't Virginia Woolf. I was not looking for a ""real"" (i.e. bummer) ending. This novel manages to be both light as a souffle and leave a bad taste in your mouth at the same time. So much for fun summer reading."
2,"Interesting, exasperating and nothing near its namesake","Smoothly read, it is an interesting read but nothing near the Bridget Jones books. Its not funny. Actually it's quite sad.Really not worth it.(this is about the audio version of the book)"
1,"Initially compelling, ultimately unsatisfactory","I awaited the publication of The Nanny Diaries with a great deal of trepidation. As a former professional nanny myself, I feared the book would cast only shame and disrepute on the profession.I couldn't have been more wrong. Instead the book, despite being about a fascinating field, managed only to bore this reader into a profound somulence."
2,Superficial-episodic-expi-al-ido-cious,"Don't be misled by the hype: This book does not explore issues of importance to nannies in any real depth. Instead, the reader gets a superficial glimpse into the narrow world of New York City's ultra-rich living on the Upper East Side. When Nan, the main character finally stands up for herself, she doesn't even do it face-to-face with her employer. What a letdown. There is no arc to the story, just a series of episodes meant to skewer the obnoxiously wealthy parents. The Nanny Diaries should be a fun romp for the New York crowd featured in the story. It's great to laugh at the foibles of these people. And it's great, finally, not to have to read about a nanny who does horrible things to the children in her charge. However, those of us struggling every day to make this intimate employer/employee relationship work out in the hinterlands will have to keep waiting for the New York publishing industry to produce a book that resonates with the rest of us."
1,I really hated this book...,"There are so many reasons why this book was terrible, but the main reasons are...Nanny, the main character, is very unlikable,there were frequent attempts at humor, but I did not laugh once,the writing is choppy and self-serving, andI wasted my time reading it!"
2,Not Enough Action,"I was really disappointed with this book considering all the hype that was associated with it. For starters, it could have done without the first six chapters. I had no interest with her following around this bratty boy - at least not to that extent. You get the picture after one chapter. The interesting part did not even start until after halfway through and even after that I couldn't find enough interest to finish. I think the story is pretty predictable and I can't believe I waisted my time reading as much of it as I did."
1,Totally Boring Ending!!!!,"My main complaint about this book was the ending. I was so angry that I wasted my money and time on a book that left me totally unsatisfied with the ending. It was almost like the authors decided to stop writing and decided 'OK, the end'. After investing so much time in these characters you really wanted to see the X's get what is coming to them and nothing happens to them. Or at the very least, have Nan's character triumph in some way.So, don't waste your money unless you enjoy making up your own ending which is what I had to do."
3,A Boring Book,I am not an expert but I thought the authors did not develope all the characters as much as they should. I realize the jest of the book was to tell about the life styles of the wealthy and the lives their children live. But I would like to know more about what happened between Nanny and H.H. I would also like to know what happened between Ms. Chicago and Mr.X.I found the book to be terribly boring.I wanted Nanny to tell Mr. and Ms.X where to get off. I was disgusted with her for allowing them to use her the way they did. I disliked both of the parents immensely. Neither of them deserved to have a child in the first place.I would like more invents told in the book about the things that happened between Nanny and the Xs. The authors kept repeating basically the same thing.
3,Good,"I enjoyed Nanny Diaries very much, but the person I felt the most sorry for was Grayer! Watching people come and go in his life, his parents ignore him, no one to really bond to. You could see how he blossomed with Nanny taking care of him, and the mother is so cruel! Yes, the book was very funny, but the downside really brings you down. I also didn't like the ending. Nothing is really resolved. It ends exactly the way it begins."
1,A...A...A...for Awful,"To be fair, I only got 2/3rds of the way through the book. I'm a voracious reader, and this now has the dubious distinction of being one of very few books I simply could not force myself to finish. Perhaps it would have improved enough in the final chapters to be worth my time investment. And perhaps I was expecting something from the book that it wasn't. I expected a clever, witty satire. Instead, the plotline was non-existent, most of the scenes were simply boring if not sad, and the Nanny character was every bit as shallow and valueless as the rich employers whom she mocked. I found nothing to admire about any of them, and the little boy Grayer was the only character worthy of sympathy. This book is mindless entertainment. I don't feel that I've missed anything by never knowing how it ended."
1,"Depressing, waste of time","I thought this book was awful. It was hyped as a comedic look at the lives of nannies in NY and their upper class bosses. I really found nothing funny about the story of Nanny and Mrs and Mr X, or the other nannies and their creepy bosses. The parents are terrible and have absolutely no redeeming qualities. The situations get worse and worse and Nanny gets more unlikeable as the story progresses. Mrs X acts like a complete monster and Nanny never stands up for herself, no matter how much Mrs X devalues her and her life. It just wasn't funny, and it's scary to think of how many ""parents"" there are who are just like the Xes."
2,Good premise spoiled by poor execution,"Too bad these nannnies are treading on Tom Wolfe turf; they might have added to his unbelievably-bad-behavior-of-the -upper-east-side-noveau-riche genre if they weren't such awfully bad writers. Any momentum the story has, in the compelling character of the little boy and his neurotic mother, is dissipated by a tepid romance subplot and dull visits to Nanny's smugly perfect family. It doesn't help that errors are frequent: it's Dorian's, not Dorrian's, and Mattel, not Matel. A good copy editor would have helped, but a rewrite by a skilled ghost writer might have been even more usueful."
2,What's funny about this book?,"I see a lot of readers say this was so funny, such a great book yada yada yada. I must have missed the ""funny"" chapter. I couldn't find one character to like or even sympathize with. I hated the spineless nanny, the kid was a brat, and the woman/mom was horrid. I realize the point of the book was to show how some of the wealthy treat their kids and help. But come on... it's not funny!"
2,Very Disappointed!,I got the Nanny Diaries based on all the great things I had Heard about it and I can tell you I was VERY Disappointed. I was hoping for a nice light Beach Read and all I got was a book about a very uphappy family and the perfect Nanny that comes into their lives. Not worth twenty-five dollars!
4,"If you thought Devil Wears Prada was okay, you'll fall in love with The Nanny Diaries","Looking at the Upper East Side lifestyle from a behind-the-scenes view, The Nanny Diaries is the perfect blend of sweetness and soreness. I thought this book would be like Devil Wears Prada, but it was ten times better. I highly recommend this book."
2,Terrible,"A disappointment all around. I had to force myself to trudge through it, and it wasn't even a lengthy read. Weak characters, boring plot. Unsubstantial!..."
3,Cinderella Strikes Back,"With a kickoff chapter titled, The Interview, the book hits the New York twin-set nanny world with a two-sided wooden spoon pounding out ""nanny abuse"" + ""good writing"".Unfortunately, the rest of the chapters are written by a real nanny, who specializes in see-through plot points and obvious names, such as ""Nan"" and ""Harvard Hottie"".I enjoyed the kicks at the non-institution of NY marriage and on the world of competitive parenting, such as the smug, ""My child goes to a better school than yours, but don't feel bad.""But there were no surprises, except earmuffs, and even the boyfriend was a clichÃ© of liberal male perfection to counteract the book's clichÃ© of male pattern badness.The book should be titled, ""They Treat Me Like the Servant (I Am),"" by Cinderella, who gets the last punch."
3,Average book,"I don't understand the big to-do about this book. The writing isn't outstanding (and it's peppered with obsenities), and the subject matter isn't original. However, it was funny in certain areas and it's easy enough to read."
3,A Fun Read...Not a Literary Masterpiece,"The Nanny Diaries is a quick-read book. As in, you read it for the entertainment value--not as a serious tome on parenting skills. I originally hoped it would be more of an expose' of the NY wealthy, but it really was just Nanny's experiences with predictable characters and situations. I'll admit I couldn't put it down but by the disappointing end, I was relieved I'd finished."
3,Depressing,This book was well written. It kept me reading and reading until I got to the end and through out the book I became more and more depressed.Being a mother myself I wanted to cry and cry for this child who was ripped away from person after person that accually cared for him. I kept hoping for some resolution. I know that there are woman out their who treat their children and their employees like this but frankly I didn't want to read about it.The other thing that really bugged me was that this woman couldn't stand up for herself.I don't know I just had a hard time with the whole situation.
3,Somewhat of a letdown,"I liked the book - but I didn't love it. I thought some of the book really dragged, especially the end. Nanny is great and my heart went out to Grayer. I wanted to pull him out of the book and give him a hug! In the end I was hoping for a little more substance."
3,Witty Tale of Two Status-Obsessed Young Women,"An amusing read told through the eyes of two young women who aren't as removed from the fabled ""Mrs. X"" as they seem to think they are. Sarcasm is only a thin veil for jealousy in ""The Nanny Diaries"", as the authors whine about not receiving the designer goods they seem to think comes attatched to working for wealthy, designer ladden mothers. They make witty, condescending (and very deserved) remarks about Mrs. X's frivolous lifestyle, yet seem to have bought into the idea that money and a loft in Manhattan is what makes a woman accomplished (provided that she has a job and takes care of her own kids, of course). For those of us who have worked endless underpaid & overworked hours in childcare, it is at times difficult to relate to the authors whose only discernable reason for not keeping their integrity in the face of such abuse is a designer handbag."
4,"Very good, but sad","I was once a nanny, and I feel so greatful for the children I cared for and their parents after reading this book. (Except that one family....)The Nanny Diaries has just about all you want in a book. You'll laugh, cry, become enraged with anger, all in one chapter. One second you hate Mrs. X. THe next sympathize her. Two pages later you want to be her best friend. Ok, sure, right. Mostly you want to hate her.It did make me run in and hug each of my sleeping angels several times, swearing that if I ever have to hire someone to help with them I will ALWAYS be the one raising them. Saddest part was thinking that what happens in this book really does happen in some families.Basically: Good but sad story. Loved the book. Kept me up nights. Would read it again. Making a list of people I know who should read it as a wake up call."
2,I expected much more,"After all the buzz on this book, I was expecting to be blown away. I was expecting the next Bridget Jones' Diary. Wow, was I disappointed. There are so many more worthwhile books out there. Do yourself a favor, and check this one out of the library if you must read it.This book is, at best, just alright. I can say that it was mildly entertaining and an easy read. The characters were a little sketchy, and I felt I had nothing invested in them. I literally didn't care what happened to them, and by the end I had to force myself to finish the book. Dialogue was a little stiff, scenes should have been thought out some more.Nanny is in a tough situation, but her solution is easy - she simply chooses not to end it all. I didn't have a lot of respect for her. I also didn't believe her attachment to the child was enough to deal with all of the .... she gets from Mrs. X.Again, while not a terrible book, it was a disappointment. Check it out from the library and save your money."
3,"Light, easy read","I found this book to be a fast, light read. While it's not classic literature, it was entertaining in the type of way that a ""People"" magazine is entertaining. It held my attention and I finished it in a couple of days' worth of train rides. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to see how the Nanny's life unfolds."
3,"Not bad, not great","I was told this book is a ""laugh riot."" It was okay.. not as funny as I thought it would be. However, it was worth the read, just don't expect too much."
2,Light and fluffy,"This is a good enough read when you just need a distraction, and can't concentrate too well. It's entertaining on some aspects, but most will be very irritated that ""Nanny"" doesn't tell ""Mrs. X"" to shove it, love for the kid or not.A word to other reviewers though - if you hate the book so much (for instance, the reviewer with the subject ""GARBAGE IN GARBAGE OUT GARBAGE THROUGHOUT!"") posting your review nearly a dozen times in a month isn't necessary. Once is plenty."
4,"Good book, rushed ending","From the hillarious beginning, where Nan (our fictional nanny and guide to the world of childcare of the rich and privileged) describes a routine job interview, and throughout most of the book (in which she describes her growing involvment with the X's lives) the book is captivating and well written. It manages to portray Nan's feelings while still be funny at the right times.My only problem with the book is its ending. The whole Nantucket vacation / firing / nannycam issue seemed as unoriginal and predictable as much as the rest of the book was original and fresh."
3,Nannies and Ninnies,"This is a good book for summer/beach reading in that the reader is quickly taken into the self-indulgent lives of the wealthy and into the unselfish hearts of those who raise their unfortunate children. The problem is that the characters, with the exception of little Grayer, are all one-dimensional. I found myself pulling for Mrs. X to do just one tiny thing right, as even the most evil occasionally do, but it wasn't to be. Although the book has been touted as being hilarious, it is actually a depressing, though speedy, read. It does provide a glimpse into a world most of us find unfamiliar and, for that alone, it's probably worth reading."
3,disappointing and disturbing,"I had to quit reading this book 2/3 of the way thru. The story was great and entertaining at first, but as ""Nanny"" failed to stand up for herself in numerous instances and ""Mrs. X"" failed to prove she was worthy of motherhood, I could not continue reading it. The story is far too disturbing. I am a mother of a 3 1/2 year old and have employed nannies in the past, and could not conceive of treating them or my son in this manner. And, if anyone treated me this way, I would certainly have something to say about it (""Nanny just complains to friends and family!!). These two aspects of the story made me conclude that it is a pathetic ""lose-lose"" situation and I chose not to continue bringing the ongoing negativity into my life!In addition, this use of ""Nanny"" as the protagonists name was downright silly - she doesn't even value herself enough to give herself a real name!!"
4,Fun of the moment - captures someting going on,"The book is a fun escape - quick read - laugh - and captures a particular time and place and group of people in New York with some zingy details - for such young authors the book is pretty well written - some nice social commentary - but with this and the devil wears prada i worry about these twenty three year old young women who can only muster a ""uh sorry?"" ""okay"" ""uh well um"" in the face of things - but then again they are young and in real life i guess they cashed in in a big way. Good for them and a relevent book in the cache of american life. The little detials are rich - and it does capture the scene which is what good writing does."
1,Too talked up . . .,"I too heard great things about this book, but was disapointed. I agree with the previous reviews word 'depressing'. I think this book is probably pretty true to many nanny/family situations, but still sad."
2,boring,This book was slow and boring. The only reason I kept reading it was to see if she ever told the X's off-which she didn't.I felt like burning this book after I finished it because it was so disappointing.
1,Bitter Self Serving Tripe,I can't believe I paid for this drivel. A couple of ex-nannies write a completely self-serving piece of trash and now they are living the high life from the proceeds...the life style they so love to look down upon from their ivory tower. Pity the child who was exposed to such holier than thou attitudes. Does the author really think she/they are any better than the parents they portray so vitriolically? I think not.
1,What happens when CRAPPY writers get book deals?,"This book. It is to literature what Star is to magazines - just a general peek into the upper crust. It is full of FLAT characters, including the protagonist. All rich women are this way! All rich women's husbands are that way! All innocent nannies are innocent nannies that really care for kids!Not good at all, and baaaaadly written."
4,A fun read,I read this on vacation and thought it was a cute story. It was an easy read and a perfect addition to your beach bag. Not deep or compelling-- just a fun read.
2,What was all the fuss?,"Sorry, but I found this book terribly disappointing. I thought it would be a collection of true stories, but ended up being fiction. I think this book would appeal to twenty-something single female singles or former nannies, but no one else. Wouldn't recommend it to friends."
4,A wonderful surprise!,"I originally only read this book because its authors grew up in my home town--but I was wonderfully surprised by how much I actually enjoyed it! It was sharply funny while still being caring--not self-consciously cynical or angst-ridden as often ""modern"" novels are. I'm looking forward to seeing anything that might come out from these writers in the future."
5,One of the best,This was an amazing book that was incredibly hard to put down. I had to read it from cover to cover immediately. Very amusing and believable. You find yourself cheering for Nanny the whole way. Great book! Looking forward to a sequel!
3,A former Nanny speaks,"The book is so true to life I believe many socialites with trophy children will be squirming! HOWEVER, I felt a little miffed at the end. I felt that 2 former Nannies could have done better! Giving Mrs. X a hard slap in the face would have appeased me! Otherwise it was a good read. I read it all in one day because I just could not put it down. That damn ending is why it only gets 3 starts from me."
3,just misses a home run,"Read this on the plane this weekend. Great idea, great situations, just a tad off on execution. A towering fly ball. Many of 'sitters situations are exciting, humorous, and totallly expected/caricatured. Still enjoyable."
2,Public relations firm hyping mediocre book,"It is annoying that so many of the reviews are written and hyped by the same person. ""Heartfelt, laughed and cried, page-turner."" Pleeeeease. I am in awe of the successful P.R. effort but after reading the book, you'll feel very disappointed.Note to overzealous P.R. firm: Let the book rise or fall on its own merits without pumping it."
4,Me and my nanny friend loved it!,"Me and my nanny friend loved it! She and I both could not put ut down....what is sad is those reviewers who think the ""characters"" are exaggerated, or, ""not real"" ! TRUST ME! They ARE! I have heard my share of mommy horror stories from my friend, some of which she could write a sequel with! This ""story"" IS true to life, and so sad for a lot of nannied children out there. My hope is that some real life Mr/Mrs X's see themselves and knock it off, their children are suffering..."
2,The Nanny Diaries,What a DISAPPOINTMENT. I was so excited to get this book because I had heard so much about it. I am probably the only person to be honest about it. It was wordy and draggy. I was just really disappointed.
5,Funny...Is it really like this??,"I read this book after hearing an interview with the authores on public radio and was curious. Having never been a nanny, I was not prepared for the craziness they encounter on a daily basis. Thank you for a great book and great laugh-out-loud fun!!"
5,Well written and addicting,"Anyone that has done any babysitting in the past will automatically connect with this book. My childcare experience isn't even close to that of the authors, but I still connected to Nan and understood her attachment to Grayer.I couldn't put this book down. It had a good mixture of amusing and serious moments, but most of all, they created a character you can really relate to. I highly recommend it."
3,Worth the read but not one of my best reads,"After some of the hype surrounding this book I thought I would really enjoy it. I was let down. Aside from being really annoyed that the main character's name was, in fact, Nanny, I thought it started out witty and cute. Very true to life. But I found it very easy to get annoyed with what a doormat this ""Nanny"" was. The ending left something to be desired. I am not sorry I read it but it was not one of those books I just couldn't put down. I do, however, think it would make a cute movie."
4,Good Book!,"This was a really good book to read, kept me intrigued the whole time. A hard book to put down!"
4,I wish Nanny wasn't such a pushover!!!,"I loved this book. As a former ""Nanny"", I found I could sadly relate. The only problem I have with this story is how totally wimpy/passive Nanny was. I would have really loved to see her tell Mrs. X off big time. Aside from that it was a great read, unfortunately women like Mrs.X really exist and it is so very sad for the childern who just want to be loved by their mommy's and daddy's."
4,Like Watching a train wreck that runs out of a steam,"I really enjoyed reading this book. The writing was sharp and the story a fun insight into modern upperclass New York City life. Mrs. X is cold and unsympathetic of course. Nan's grandma is warm and wonderful. I looked forward to reading this book every chance I got to see what Nan would have to put up with next and if there'd be any bombshell showdowns. However, without spoiling it for others, I wasn't satisfied with the story's contrived climax or ending. Still, I would recommend this book to read."
2,Fluffy hype.,"The Nanny Diaries is a lot of hype. Borrow it from a friend for a silly read at the beach. Save your cash for an other book (suggest Lucky Man - Michael J Fox, loving that book at the moment)."
2,A waste,"Lately, I have been unable to find a book that could captivate my attention. After reading wonderful reviews of this book, I had my sister take me to buy it. Big mistake. I took me two days to read it, because the entire time I was hoping the book would eventually get better. Big surprise- it didn't."
2,what a whimp!,"I am extremely disappointed with this book. Poor character progression.... By the end of the book I thought that Nanny deserved all she got for letting Mrs. X get away with that attitude. I can tell that instead of leaving the x's a dirty message for revenge, the authors of this book just decided to use the book as revenge. What unsympathetic characters!!!"
3,"quick read, little depth","This is a fun, light, and entertaining book. Offers a brief look into the life of a NY ""surrogate"" mom.... a nanny. But if you are looking for literature, don't bother.... this book is a quick read, and you do wonder at the end what will happen to the main characters."
4,Calling All Childcare Workers,"So you have been a nanny? oh, you havn't. A babysitter, that's alright. You too can enjoy The Nanny Diaries. Learn how the other half lives. Upscale apartments, cheap labor, kids without the hassle of kids.The real joy of the ND is in the realness of the characters. (Trust me, I have done the nanny/babysitter thing). First we have our Nanny, bright, educated, trustworthy. Then we have the Mr. and Mrs., Wealthy, oblivious, and obvious. Then the child, misunderstood, pushed and damaged.This is real. Nannies are expected to clean, cook, drive, punish, and love a child that is not her own.This book brings all of those tasks to the forefront and lets the reader sit back and enjoy the ride. So hop on board and read it. And if you are one of those nasty people that employs a nanny, read the book and then give him/her a good raise."
3,Nanny Nanny Two By Four,"As the son of wealthy parents who was raised by a nanny (Franny!), I feel compelled to comment on this fast-paced dual-authored rollercoaster romp through the lives of the rich, spoiled, and famous. My tyranical parents bossed Franny around from the onset and treated her much as these authors were allegedly treated by their employers. It's a shame children have to be raised by employees of their parents, but heck, it could be a lot worse. And Franny got her revenge when she deflowered me in the backseat of Daddy's Beamer for my sixteenth birthday."
1,See Jane Run,"Amazon forced me to give this book at least one star, but I'd really give it a big ol' ZERO. It took two grown women to write something that could have been written by one of their 5 year old charges. Their writing skills would be put to better use by the folks that churn out Harlequin Romances. Keep your day jobs, ladies. I cannot imagine why this book was so popular. Fran Drescher? The cute cover? Confusion with the Princess Diaries?"
1,Trite cliche,"As a former NYC nanny, I found this work embarrassing and nothing but a huge cliche. How sad to know that it took *two* authors to write such trivial one-sided characters, and such a redundant, obvious storyline."
2,Not Quite Worth It...,"I bought this book craving for something funny to read and from it's hype and fabulous reviews, I thought 'hey! this is a must read'. Boy, was I wrong. It started off well enough and it's first chapter hooked me in but it progressively got worse and worse and I found myself just skimming haphazardly through chapters. I couldn't wait to finish the book so I could move on to something better. Yes, the subject may be untouched and therefore seem original but other than that, there isn't really much to it. In fact, I think the word I'm looking for is BORING. The authors didn't really know where to take the story I believe and it just went on and on. So my advice to you is to save your money and wait for something better to come along."
2,Very Disappointing,"Wow- they must have had great publicity to create all that buzz, because this book actually stinks. It was a great concept, but so poorly written the protaganist is not even likeable.It could easily have been condensed into an article. I don't know who edited this thing, but the ending was awful, and there was no resolution to subplots, including the nanny's relationship with her boyfriend.Very disappointing. Don't waste your money- wait for the movie."
2,Revenge of the Nannies,"Starts of good...nice details that will shock and amuse you. The nannies speak for all others who come in contact with these ignorant clueless parents. Unfortunately, once the fun wears off it becomes boring and tedious. The nanny love interest/tie -in is for the high school readers out there."
3,"Light fun Read, but falls a little flat","The Nanny Diaries was a light read that took me about an afternoon to finish. The story of a NYU student and Nanny in Manhatten kept my intrest, but fell a little flat.My main complaint is the character names; Nanny, Mr. and Mrs.X. If this is fiction then give the characters names. My other complaint is the hipocracy of Nanny. She is annoyed with the materialism she witnesses, but loves the Prada shoes she is given and falls for a Harvard Hottie. Nanny is striving to become the Xes.Although, I have complaints I did enjoy this book as a guilty pleasure."
4,Quick read,"I liked this book, but the whole time I wanted to jump into Nanny's body and yell at Mrs. X for being so damn nasty!"
5,Heart-Wrenching,"I held off a bit before buying this novel. It did not seem very interesting, but when my friends began to strongly recommend it, I caved, and went out and bought it. To my surprise it was superb. At times you will be enraged in anger with Mrs. And Mr. X, at others you will be falling over laughing at Grayer, Nanny or the other characters, but for the most part in the end your eyes will be filled with tears. It truly was a fantastic novel - heart wrenching yet hilarious."
1,Trash,"Books that I enjoy I can't put down, and when I am done I share with a friend or donate it to our local library. This book I could not put down because I kept waiting for it to get better, to live up to its hype, to be something substantial. When I was done with it, I did what I have NEVER done with a book.... I put it in the trash where it belongs. No imagination, or creativity went into this book. The characters on both sides, Nan and Mrs X were too stereotypical to like, love or believe in. This book is one of the few I have read that I consider literary garbage. Who considers emotional child abuse from a parent funny? Would we consider a poor woman's neglect of her child humor? Give me a break."
3,Can you relate?,"I used to be a Mother's helper and as such could relate to some of these experiences (even went to Nantucket with the family,) which is probably why I kept reading! The ending was a bit of a hard landing but this is nice light summer reading; makes me very grateful for the work I do now. Also a good exercise in asking yourself, how much s--- would I put up with in a job?!"
3,Very Funny but Too Disturbing,"I, like many other reviewers, couldn't put this book down. The Nanny of the title has many hilarious moments, but it is the sickening or scary ones that stay with you. I beleive that there probably are people like the X's out there, but I hope in real life the Nanny speaks up at least for herself if not for the child. It is an interesting and fast read, but I wasn't expecting the disturbing reality of the parents. The marketing of the book was a bit misleading as I understood it just to be a comedy. I would give the book more stars if I had known what I was getting into when buying it."
2,I was furious!!!,"I read this book in one sitting ( I really couldn't put it down!), but all the same, it really made me angry. I used to be a nanny, and the things that Nan put up with were totally uncalled for! I couldn't believe that someone would actually put up with all of that. I am not sure if the authors would really have reacted that way in real life, or if they would just like it if everyone thinks that they would. It feels as though the authors wanted us to picture them as some sort of saints or something. I think this book would have been a lot better if Nan had been a little more real and a little more feisty, and a LOT less long suffering!!!"
1,All the adults were horrible,"I read this book to the end hoping to find one adult worth knowing something about. There are none. Nan gets what she deserves because of her inability to set boundaries. The X's never show a moment of humanity. Four-year old Grayer is less a human child than an artful construct against which the inhumanity of the adults is portrayed. I was embarrassed earlier this year because I read a sort-of bodice ripper called ""Fancy Pants"" and enjoyed it. I am much more embarrassed to have read this bit of junk."
4,"Great Book, Frustrating Characters","I read this book in 3 days. I started reading it only on my lunch hour, but found myself reaching for it at home as well. It was a quick, easy read. I found myself laughing out loud at some of the situations Nan got herself into, but overall I was just frustrated with the situation. I can see why she didn't stand up to Mrs. X, EVER (which as I can see was a major concern for other reviewers). But QUIT for goodness sake!! I realize this is a work of fiction, but it has some fact-based experiences that could really make a reader want to scream fruitlessly into the book. 4 stars for entertainment, 1 star for frustration."
5,The Nanny Diaries made me laugh so hard I cried!,"""The Nanny Diaries"" is the perfect book if you need a ood laugh!! It is about a young city girl, named ""Nanny"", who is a college student. She has just been hired to take care of Grayer, the son of Mr. and Mrs. X. Grayer doesn't like Nanny at first, but soon grows to have fun with her and think of her as his ""second mom"". Nanny learns alot about taking care of children in this book and has a few wild adventures at the playground and while giving Grayer a bath. She even gives Grayer his lunch while he is taking his bath!! This book is absolutely adorable and will have anyone who reads it falling out of their chair. This book is the modern-day story of a young woman in New York City who has been hired as a nanny. After reading this book, the position as a nanny won't seem as easy as it looks anymore, I promise!! This is by far the funniest book I've ever read. I couldn't put it down."
4,Outrageous behavior made my stomach turn,"""The Nanny Diaries"" paints a sad picture of how the upper crust raise their children. As the reader, I felt sorry for Nanny, being used and abused by Mrs. X, though I wanted her so badly to stand up for herself and say, enough is enough already and for heavens sake, pay attention to your son already! I also felt sorry for poor Grayer, the child who was all but abandoned by his parents. All he ever wanted were his parents, but they were so busy with their petty adult lives, they couldn't have cared less. The mild revenge Nanny gets at the end, though, isn't enough. I know the Xes won't get the message, and Grayer will just have to get whatever love he can from yet another nanny, who will no doubt be taken advantage of until she dares to speak up..The writing style is a little spare; I could have used more description and a sense of feeling. In any case, though, I definitely appreciate my own children a lot more now!"
3,light and pleasantly entertaining.,"This book allows the reader to take a peak inside the lives of rich Manhattanites through the accounts of their nanny. This light, entertaining reading appeals to the voyeuristic side will all have when it comes to the rich, famous, select fews of the planet.It will make a good gift for a hopelessly romantic young woman dreaming to marry the perfect guy,any young woman addicted to ""lifestyles of the rich and famous"" or for an ex-nanny!"
1,The Charm Escapes Me Completely!,"I couldn't even get through half of this poorly-written book. It was as though the authors were trying way too hard to think of catchy descriptive words to fit in ad nauseum. I thought it would be ""hilarious"", but I didn't find it funny in the slightest, in fact it was very boring and empty. It didn't hold my attention, the characters were one dimensional and the writing was oh, so completely bad!I found myself thinking after turning virtually every page, ""what a waste of time this is"". I finally tossed it into my garage sale box after forcing myself to read almost 1/2 of the book. The popularity of this mindless piece (rather than the subject) makes me worry about the state of society!"
2,Light and fluffy,"This is a good enough read when you just need a distraction, and can't concentrate too well. It's entertaining on some aspects, but most will be very irritated that ""Nanny"" doesn't tell ""Mrs. X"" to shove it, love for the kid or not.A word to other reviewers though - if you hate the book so much (for instance, the reviewer with the subject ""GARBAGE IN GARBAGE OUT GARBAGE THROUGHOUT!"") posting your review nearly a dozen times in a month doesn't prove your point that the book is terrible. It just makes the rest of certain that you have no life."
2,Not an Exciting Diary,"Everyone said this book was great, so maybe my expectations were too high. I kept waiting for something to happen, for Nanny to get even or something, but it never did. This is, as the book's title suggests, a diary. You read Nanny's day to day tribulations and sometimes something interesting happens, but not often enough."
3,No No Nan,"Funny in a sad/pathetic way. Quick read. Made you want to get to the end. But why'd the main character, Nan, have no backbone whatsoever? That was the annoying part! Hopefully that was supposed to be a subtle point...that her character traits were taken to the extreme just like those of her employers."
4,Great Book- but the ending needs help!,"This book is a can't-put-it-down kind! I read it cover-to-cover in one setting. The writing is humorous and you really feel attached to Grayer and his pecularities. And I rooted for Nanny and her H.H. all the way. But the end of the book just lets it all go and doesn't tie anything up. It's almost like the authors were told to keep it to 300 pages and they stopped writing when they got there. They should have gone more into why Mrs. X. was so upset with Nanny. The end was a real let-down. Overall, I loved the book and I know I'll read it again and again. I'll just make up my own endings every time."
3,It had potential,"I bought this book through a book club when it first came out. There was so much hype and I'd seen the authors on an interview show. Seemed like the premise for an entertaining read. Well, it had potential but I felt it really fell short. You take a nanny job with a family who lives in a gazillion dollar place on the Upper East Side. They're too busy to deal with their own darlings. What do you expect them to be like?"
2,What's the big deal?,"With all the great books out on the market, I can't figure why this book is popular. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never happened."
1,Waste of Time,"This book sounded so intriguing and I could't wait to read it.Then, I couldn't wait for it to end. I am the type who has to read a book thru. It did get better in one of the last chapters, but all I can say is SAVE YOUR MONEY. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!"
1,not worth your time or money,"i just finished this book, and all i can say is: ""i want my money back"". ... the characters in this book are completely shallow, the situations often take unexpected yet disappointing twists, and the only thing that will keep you reading is the bleak hope that something interesting will happen. i'll save you the time: nothing interesting happens. in the whole book. ever."
4,"Good book, but what happened to the proofreaders?","I was interested in the book. The authors did a great job of describing the parents and Greyer, or was it Grover, or did I miss something? Were they twins? I assume the authors changed the kid's name at the last minute but the computer didn't catch all the spots - and never the nickname ""Grove."" Sometimes both names were used in one line. I kept being bothered. Nor did the spell checker catch ""runing"" for ""running"" or ""baek"" for ""back."" St. Martins, your proofreaders are subversive!"
2,Amazon oversold this one!,"With a 5-year-old grandson in New York, I was interested in the nanny scene and, on impulse, ordered this book from Amazon. While in some ways it was an entertaining (though often painful) read, it felt more like an extended cartoon than a genuine novel. Literature it ain't! Be forewarned."
3,Nanny needs her own nanny,"Let me just start off with the fact that the first half of the book I read with great pleasure. The second half of the book was almost torture. I wanted to jump in the pages and shake the heck out of Nanny. She needs someone to guide her and inform her on what is right and wrong. I couldn't take the whining, the endless whining. Please Nanny, forget the $800 dollars, pretend you never got it in the mail! Nanny, we have all worked while in school. Prioritize!! Please, can anyone stop all the whining?"
2,Overrated!,"This book is completely overrated. The lead character is a spineless, annoying individual, who even when encountered with the perfect opportunity to stand up for themselves, they are too much of a coward to do it. It's something else when the employer, the mother of the child she cares for, is far more interesting than the lead character. That character had depth, which made you sometimes pity her and at other times hate her, which somehow left you wanting to know more about her (as opposed to our lead character.) This was a mindly entertaining book.This book was a cheap knockoff of the ""THE DEVIL LOVES PRADA"", which is an excellent book. Now that book had an array of characters (especially the lead character) with depth."
2,Slow and Bad language,"This book started off fairly interesting, but as I progressed, the F word began to appear and I quit. Do not recommend this mundane, uninteresting book."
1,Upper East Side Misery,"Only read this book if you want to hear how the wealthiest 10% of America live. Having worked in the Upper East Side I can assure you that its one of the most miserable places on the earth- hence money doesnt make you happy. Snotty rich kids being raised by their nannies, socialite attititudes ""Do you know who I AM??"" mentality, this book reveals it all. Enter the world of doormen, service entrances ,kiss ... building supers , personal chefs, etc. After youre done with this book, you will be glad you arent a rich snob who is to busy to raise her kids right and needs a nanny and a live in maid! This might save you money the next time a powerball jackpot catches your eye - it just might not be worth it....."
2,whatever,"I don't get all the hype about this book. Maybe it's because there are so many like it on the market today. I found the present tense, first person narrative annoying and the main character whiny through most of the book. The ending was very disappointing and really predictable. Every possible stereotype of a WASP socialite mother was included.Not really worth the time to read."
1,confidentiality isn't important to the author,"Even though this story may be entertaining, it loses all charm when it as billed as an expose and pokes fun at the family. It is clear that the person that wrote this book was working only to support herself through school, and wonder if she thought at all about the job she was supposed to do, and the impact she was having on the child. No matter who I am, when I hire someone in a small business or my home, I have the right to expect my wishes to be followed and my privacy to be protected. Today employers are very limited in what they can say about employees when called for references. If the employer were to write a sequel to this book, the author would probably sue."
1,Not that good,"I don't know why people like this book. I think it's poorly written and not that intersting. The summary of the book on the back cover, made it seem like the main character ""Nanny"" found some secrets of Mrs. X that she used it to revenge on Mrs. X later on. So I read and read to see what kind of revenge Nanny would do. But, no... nothing... I was duped to think that Nanny would do some kind of revenge. The ending was horrible and the book is very bland. I was disappointed and wanted my money back. And I agree with some of the users' reviews that HH character-- Harvard Hotty -- is so irrelevant. He is there just so that there is some romance to satisfy the female readers. Skip this book."
3,A nice surface novel,"I won't lie, I enjoyed this book, but I found Nanny's character frustrating as in how much abuse from the X's she put up with. The take on the rich uppercrust seemed one-dimensional to me, and I never got a good feel for Nanny, particularly in her saga with H.H. I often wondered if the author didn't elaborate on the wrong things."
3,Funny??,"Maybe I'm missing the joke here or I've lost my sense of humor, but what is so funny about seeing a young woman being degraded and degrading herself, a middle-aged woman doing almost everything but standing on her head to get her cold and distant husband's attention, lashing out her anger on any poor bystander and a basically good kid who is ignored by his parents? Every person in this book is miserable, is that's what's suppose to be funny? I don't know, I just found it very sad and depressing personally."
