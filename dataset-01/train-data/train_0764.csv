3,Know what you're getting,"I bought two of the 256 MB memory sticks assuming they would work the same way as the 126's. They actually work very well in my Sony DSC-P10, and I love having the large capacity so that I don't have to change sticks so often if I'm taking a large number of pictures.However...like the previous reviewer, I was extremely disappointed that the 256 MB doesn't work with our Sony television which displays wonderful slide shows by inserting a memory stick into a special slot at the front of the TV. The 126's work fine. As a result, I'm considering going back to all 126's so the family can enjoy the slide shows on the large TV screen.If that's not a consideration for you, and you know from the information provided by other reviewers that the 256's will work in your camera, go for it."
1,Not Reliable,"I bought this memory for my Sony TRV-50 camcoder, so that I can store more digital pics on the memory, before downloading them on my computer. Few days later, the memory stick stopped working. My camcorder gave memory error, and was unable to read it or reformat it. I tried in other devices too, and the same thing, unable to read the memory stick. All my pics got lost and I of course lost the memory stick too. Kinda waste of money for me. I think Sony's memory sticks are costly, but atleast they are reliable."
3,"Nice memory , but I bought this thinking that it is 256MB","In fact this memory is a 2 x 128MB, meaning you have to switch from ""A"" to ""B"" when you get 128MB of photos/video. I bought these to take some underwater photos, so how am I suppose to take this memory stick out of my camera, switch to the other free 128MB and place it back on, all these underwater?!I think LEXAR should advertise that this product is a 2x128MB and not 256MB as they did."
3,Lexar 256 memory,"I just bought another one because the last one gave me the ""format error"" mentioned by other reviewers. Otherwise, for the cost and the capacity, I am willing to give it another try. It did cause problems for me in my profession, but my clients allowed me to reshoot, and I need the extra space. There are not many choices of memory for those of us not willing to give up our old Sony DSC S85 cameras. These are no longer being manufactured so I guess Lexar became aware of the problems. What can you do ?"
1,basura=garbage,Bought two of these piece of crap. Filled them up with pictures on special trip with my wife; came back home only to find out that the disks had a memory stick error. Could not retrieve any of my precious pictures. Get SONY forget LEXAR!
1,Do not buy - I second that!,"I recently purchased a 256 Lexar stick at a Target store and after my first time filling it up with pictures I got the ""Format Error"" message just as the other reviewer explained. I was able to eventually download most of my photos, but did loose a few. Luckily, Target took the stick back and gave me a refund. Now, one of the 128 Lexar sticks I bought last year gave me a ""Format Error"" after taking a photo. Luckily, I was able to quickly delete the picture and it seems to be working okay now. I am not confident in the durability of this stick so I will NEVER buy Lexar sticks again. When you are recording memories, just spend the extra money on SONY. It's worth it! I have two Sony sticks (one two years old and one a year old.) I have NO problems with these."
2,Not as adverised,"I had the same problem as other customers with the mail in rebate that never arrived. Also the product needs drivers installed with older windows versions, which can be annoying to find and download. Other than this it works fine."
3,Don't bother with the mail-in rebate,"I have twice been cheated by Lexar on mail-in rebates. But at least they sent me a card explaining that my UPC is invalid (God knows) on one occasion.The product itself is OK. I haven't experienced any difference between this one and the one that came with my camera. When you consider buying it, just assume you won't get the rebate from Lexar Cheaters, Inc."
1,poor performance and bad customer relation department,"I bought Lexar Media 128 MB memory stick 2 months back and then it was on 'mail in rebate' but I never received one even after sending all the documents with proof of purchase and the bar codes that I could find on the package. The battery consumption of this stick is also more as compared to the sony counter part, which I owned it before. So even though I paid same amount of money, the performance I got is far less than the sony.I recommend that go for the sony one because at least you will get what you paid for and you won't be fooled by the mail in rebate gocha.."
5,Lexar Media 256 MB Memory Stick,I purchased this memory stick and have been extrememly happy with it. I have a Sony 5.0 digital camera and have been using this memory stick constantly for the past few months with no problems. I would recommend it highly!
3,"Good tool, very bad packaging.","This is a real good kit, it has a variety of useful accesories and the tool is very powerful. My complaints is about the packaging when shipped, I received broken all of 5 boxes I bought. I'd ask the store for taking care when packaging so the case does not be broken during shipping an handling."
3,well......ummm,"well this is a starters kit (you get what you pay for).... a couple of pieces broke off and wear and tear super quickly when i was dealing with metal, hard aluminum, and plastic.not the rotary head. just the attachments break and wear off easily.AND THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS!!!!! on how to install the parts.some pieces where either too small or just a little large, so I had to stick tissue paper in between to get some grip.I would never buy this again. I could only recommend this for people who want to get a feeling of these kits. Other then that I would never recommend it to anyone else with experince"
1,What a piece of GARBAGE,"I bought this product for my fiancee, as he's going to be making little wooden boxes, and I stain and etch and sell them. I thought getting a good little starter set with a lot of pieces would be perfect for him. It arrived on time, I can't complain about that at all.However, the first time he used it, the power button popped off, and then he couldn't get the little tool that he was using out of the actual machine. The case broke the second he opened it, and now it completely doesn't work. I'm very disappointed and upset because this was his anniversary gift and I thought it'd be a lot of fun for him because he's always been interested, but it turned out to be a waste of money.Lucky for us, it comes with a warranty, and we'll be sending it in so that we can receive a new one. Which coincidentally will be going straight onto Amazon, since I'd never purchase from this seller or brand ever again."
1,unsatisfying,"weak tool for metal application. doesnt perform well even on the softest metals. although i havent tried it on other materials, the cutting wheels were not helpful on aluminum."
1,"Nice set, but the tool died after a few minutes of use","I got this for use by some high school students in Science Olympiad. It worked great for a couple of hours doing various jobs intermittently. Then while sanding items, it was laid down to get the next piece. When it was picked up to sand the next piece, nothing happened when turned on. The tool totally died that quickly and with absolutely no warning.The only good news is that all of the parts in the kit should be usable by another tool (a real Dremel tool?) that is reliable. Based on the other reviews, I am chalking this up as a learning lesson (you get what you pay for). If it costs any more then the one way shipping for warranty repair, it will be too much."
4,PHOENIX !,"My first earfull of kerosene dream came off of a cd i got from the Horde Festival in portland, Ore. 1998. A super band, the song Phoenix is kick. the rest of this cd is good to. I hope these guys stick around and kick it somemore!"
1,Don't buy this,"Terrible collection of the worst movies I have seen. Very poor acting, special effects and direction, results in a complete waste of money and time."
4,no brainer entertainment,can't beat the price for ten movies that appear very clear and easy to load.Just plain un serious fun.Well worth the money
3,Batdot and Boyd SIZZLE,"While there is one raw sequence of frank sensuality between Bardot and Boyd, the impact of this film lies in its subtle underplayed performances--Alida Valli gives one of her best portrayals as the ambivalent rival aunt to Bardot in conquering Boyd... the stud of the piece.. Only Vadim could have such a role reversal in late 50's cinema! Excellent scoreby Auric and sumptious location photography. Bravo!"
3,Bardot sizzles but Boyd fizzles,"This movie had the potential of being an exceptional love story but Boyd's portrayal of the lead character, Lamberto, just doesn't cut it in my view. Lamberto is virtually devoid of any charm, emotion, passion or romantic qualities. How can two women fall in love with this guy is beyond my comprehension.The best performance is given by Alida Valli, the aunt of Bardot.Bardot gives a solid performance as a hopelessly-in-love young woman. At least she shows some emotion and passion unlike her male co-star. Bardot's uninhibited style is never more evident than in this movie. However, in some scenes Bardot is simply being pushed and tossed around like a rag doll by Boyd. Not exactly what I would call great chemistry between the two.A more charming, sensitive and passionate Lamberto would have made this a more compelling movie. Nonetheless, I do believe the movie is far from a complete washout. It is certainly worthy of purchase by any Bardot fan."
4,"Showcase for pretty, pouty Brigitte Bardot","The Brigitte Bardot of the 1950s was just developing her sex kitten style, provocatively posing and walk-gliding, teasing with a minimum of nudity (half-exposed breasts and backside), showering - in a bikini! - and otherwise doing gratuitous things like pillow fighting and mock bullfighting. She is lovely to watch, and Stephen Boyd is her sulky, smouldering lover who murdered her rich uncle, his former employer, and is now on the run with Bardot trailing along. The story is similar to Godard's ""Breathless"" though not as good, a much better effort was ""Contempt"" which Bardot filmed for Godard in the early 60s. Though the story is thin, the rocky Spanish countryside scenery is lovely, as was the young Bardot."
5,in a word: LOVE,Really great movie. Loved it. You know you'll always get a good movie if it's about a writer! Rent it.
3,Funny but not in the way you think it should be,"The premise of this movie is funny, but it goes in a dark direction as the author in the movie needs to work on his own serious emotional and relationship issues in order for it to come to conclusion. It's definitely not bad and very unique as a movie, but it is hard to recommend as it did not end up being funny as they had portrayed it."
4,Be careful what you wish...or write...for,"A novelist with writer's block and no social life writes his dream woman, and she comes to life and shows up in his condo. She is real; others can interact with her too. The problem is that although we might like a partner we can fit to our specifications, there can be no spontaneity or surprise when you are controlling and manipulating such a partner. Good food for thought and strong acting from all involved."
4,Not your run of the mill romantic comedy,"This clever romantic comedy is based on the age-old concept of a guy conjuring up his dream girl. It also deals with the issue of control in a relationship. Paul Dano comes across as maybe a tad melancholy for this role and it has at least one dark scene, but it is still worth a look."
2,Very Disappointing,Great idea for a film. Like the cast. . .but this a failure. So disappointed after watching the first 1/4 of the film.
1,Pass.,I had such high hopes for this film but gave up on it after about an hour. It was horribly slow moving and not funny at all.
1,Dreadful movie,"The main character's eyebrows conveyed bemused wonderment much of the movie as he gazed raptly upon his creation, a ditzy female whose main charm seemed to be smooth young flesh and an irritating, forced spontaneity.The family get-together scene with aging hippie Mom and her bohemian boyfriend was particularly hard to stomach as her relentless joie de vivre, and ever present plastered on grin made me want to hurl something at the tv.Ruby,however, was in hog heaven at the braying laughter and non-stop, lovey dovey emotings of the fam.Acting, 1 star. Plot line, 2 stars. My decision to waste my time watching this garbage - negative star and a half. Note to self - life isn't endless - find something anything else to occupy the mind next time ennui strikes."
1,"Michael Silverblatt, tell me it ain't so!","Mr. Silverblatt, please tell me you didn't read a script. Tell me that they made it sound gorgeous, that they threw fistfuls of cash at you. Because this movie only dragged two stars out of me because the cinematography wasn't crap. My girlfriend is raising a fuss: ""No, ONE star!"" The premise had so much going for it. Hell, it could have turned into a decent horror flick. Ah, nevermind--you're all going to watch it anyway and I haven't even really started here, so I'm gonna just wrap this up because I've already given this damn movie enough of my time. ""One star,"" she says. You know what? Yeah, one star. (Bookworm's awesome, though. Keep on, Mr. Silverblatt!)"
3,Comedy?,"...not exactly; this movie took a very dark turn when the mind of the creator of the perfect girlfriend sort of short-circuited. The potential for psychological thriller was there. So, this movie was not what I was expecting (and those expectations came mainly from the trailers...a no-no in and of itself). The movie's premise looked ripe for comedic mining, but never really dug deep enough."
3,It's alright.,"I'm just an average joe type of guy. I'm not looking for profound- life changing point from the movies but simple enjoyment when I watch. This movie starts out okay and develops into nice fantasy situational comedy. However- as it needs to come to its climax, it overplayed the dramas and fell flat in my opinion. I didn't want to give away anything but if you watch it, I think you'll know what I mean. Not great but alright"
4,Nice romantic comedy,"...without too much sap. Clever premise. And I really like the actors, especially the leads. Paul Dano reminds me of a young James Spader and Zoe Kazan was refreshing."
3,Wait...Uh...Can We Start Over?,"That line would have sounded fresh 20 years ago, but since ""Stranger Than Fiction"" and ""Being John Malkovich"" it often feels like plowing the same old ground. A famous novelist with writer's block has his dream girl leap off the page. The script misses some real opportunities to explore the issue of getting bored with a girlfriend who follows your every whim and instead falls back into generic rom-com at times. Rod Serling could have come up with many more unique scenes even in 30 minutes."
3,Meta-cheese,"After studying Cervantes and his classic Don Quijote, I find it interesting that his influence has even made it to hollywood movies (also Stranger Than Fiction). The connection of author with characters has been a trademark of Spanish literature for hundreds of years. So, maybe the only reason why I even give it 3 stars is because I'm such a book-worm. I also tend to be a sucker for movies with writers as the main character. But this one reminded me too much of the Butterfly Effect, a far more interesting movie. He keeps trying to correct this girl he's invented but she's taken on a life of her own. Sometimes you just have to leave things the way they are. Its a cute movie, but kind of predictable and cliche. Interesting idea but I think it could have been done a lot better."
3,"Neat idea, but...","Although the idea had some possibilities, I couldn't get past how much of a schmuck the lead character generally was, especially in his treatment of Ruby and his former girlfriend. Ruby even seemed to treat his dog better than he did..."
3,"Fun, interesting story.",It's tough to tell if the main character is in fact crazy and you worry about that the whole movie. But the end satisfies that worry even if you're not sure what the heck just happened.
4,Not What I Was Expecting,"Definitely not what I was expecting, but still enjoyed the movie. I recommend checking it out if you enjoy slightly dark comedies."
5,Ruby Sparks,"The movie caught me off balance for a while. Then it picked up momentum, and I thought we were headed into a wicked and cruel ending. I was glad the writer took a different approach and headed for ""happily ever""."
2,"Great start, downhill after 25 minutes",I enjoyed the premise of this movie and looked forward to watching it. It seemed to fall apart and I didn't like anything after the 25 minute mark.
3,"i liked it, wife said, ""meh""","Nice concept and execution, it's just not going to the top of my list. I would recommend at least a rent of it, though."
2,It's Alright,"This movie got a lot of hype, I'm not sure why. The main character is kind of dull and it's hard to feel sympathy for him. Ruby is actually a lively and fun character and there are moments were there is a lot of joy and silliness. But overall I didn't feel like this movie came together well."
5,Loved it!,I enjoyed this so much that I went out and bought it on DVD. Great story. The writing was super. Good job Zoe. Paul was excellent as the lead I can not wait to watch it again
5,More than expected,"Was hoping for a simple love story, but found something wonderful instead. Its light and sweet and interesting.... but eventually you discover youve slipped past fantasy and into what really can happen in a relationship. This is one of those movies that stick with you & think about the next day- in a pleasant way. I found myself going back to re-watch it with a different set of eyes even after seeing the conclusion. This was better than expectations, without sappiness and pretense. Id recommend it and already have."
5,Love story with a twist,"What could be more ideal than constructing your own girlfriend? Well, when a young and successful writer does that, he runs into all sorts of moral conundrums. This is a beautifully constructed story with solid acting and direction. Very fun and interesting."
5,All's well that ends well.,"I really liked this movie. A fantasy along the lines of Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind. It is Quirky, Smart, Funny, Dark, Saccharine, and sweet all mixed up in one show."
3,The inspiration may have come from a Twilight Zone episode.,"I agree with some of these reviews that say the film starts of really well, but the last 20 minutes are not quite as well executed. Though, all in all, an enjoyable ride, and enchanting performances. I don't think anyone would regret watching this film.Once you've watched the movie, check out Twilight Zone Season 1, Ep. 36 ""A World of His Own."" An episode starring Keenan Wynn from the very first season of Twilight Zone with a very, very similar premise to ""Ruby Sparks."" And it's executed in just 22 minutes!"
2,"The trailer looks cute, but the movie is very dark and mean.","The trailer makes this movie look all fun and romantic and cute...However...This movie starts out sort of that way, but then it all becomes dark and sadistic. I would say that 75% of the movie is dark and sadistic.SPOILER: The main character is a mess and keeps changing the girl every time she does something he doesn't like. She ends up being his slave. She ends up a mess and super unhappy, and he eventually tortures her in the end. I really did not enjoy this movie. Not what I expected in a bad way... Very dark and cruel. There is no character in this movie that I like or can relate to."
4,BOOK !!!,"Enjoyed this move. Good performances by cast. BUT !!! Having read the book ""Girl On Paper """" a classic In my humble opinion this movie is an identical idea of the book and not half as good. Read the book, see the movie and see what YOU think. But in saying this. I still as stated enjoyed the movie."
3,Very relevant to today's events...,"First off, do not think that this will give you an in-depth look at the combat situations these groups entered into. A great deal is only touched upon, i.e. ""they encountered strong resistance, then the enemy fled"", but the actions of valor that these men did individually is given considerable attention.What this book is mainly focusing on is the ""military necessity"" that created a sort of legal racism that was not held across the board. The fact that these men did what they did despite how their very own country treated them is inspiring at the very least.But I do feel that this book can mirror current events as well. Granted, I hope we have learned that lesson, but we can still look at this example when we deal with other nations who are predominately non-white and assume that ""they"" are all the same, for indeed they are not."
5,Excellent,"I received the book in excellent condition. I was hesitant at first because it was so much cheaper than what it normally would cost but it looks brand new. The only flaw was a black mark on the binding. Other than that, there was nothing wrong with it."
3,Very heavy duty welding clamp.,"Heavier than they need to be. You will not be throwing these clamps around the shop. Not for the tool box, but OK."
1,Horrible book. Peter Hounam deseperate for a buck using the Mossad as his story,"First off, Mr Peter Hounam should get his facts streight. He's covering a story he seems to know nothing about. The books is horribly written, lie after lie, and he's promoting Vanunu a world class trader. Do not waste your money on this book as it's worthless."
1,Trash!,"Woman from Massad was written poorly, full of innuendos without facts, anti-israeli; a waste of my time."
3,"Nice trike, better for older kids","We got this for our 2 year old for his birth day. It looks cute! Two big drawbacks. I cant really control the direction for the bike with the push bar, and my two year old doesnt really know to direct the handle bars yet so I am constantly bending down to adjust the direction where the bike moves. And the push-handle does'nt stay firmly put it keeps moving, making it hard to use it. I guess it will be good for him once he grows into it a little and I dont need the push bar so much."
3,OKAY....,After the main characters first encounter I didn't even want to read this book. I was totally upset and I really didn't want their relationship to progress. As far as Lisa Kleypas books go it was not her best. Writting style wise I thought it was her usual style which I love but I really disliked both of the main characters through most of it.
1,Adidas ruined perfection,"I ran in every generation of this stability-control shoe since gen-2. By gen-9 they have totally trashed the shoe. The ride for slight over-pronators has definitely degraded, but the maddening and absolutely inexcusable design flaw is the d*mned squeak that sets in anywhere between 50 & 125 miles of use. There's a tubular insert in the heal (just look at the bottom)that obviously loosens fairly quickly and then--squeak-squeak-squeak...every plant! (even when you're walking.)I've moved on to Mizuno Nirvana's--heavier, but what a great ride. Farewell, Adidas, I guess you didn't love me as much as I did you. Your loss, though, and likely forever."
4,"Examines the who/what/where/when of the Clinton ""Scandal""","This book was quite an interesting read. Clinton-bashers are likely to consider it liberal pap, but there are some serious points presented in the book. It is unfortunate that the information found in the book had to be presented in this format and not in the public media. If the media had fulfilled its obligation to provide balanced news instead of only news that sells, today's current events might look very different. The book presents, in my opinion, a good starting point for those wishing to pursue the possibility that there might actually be something resembling a ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" that Hillary Clinton alluded to on the Today Show, January 27, 1998. The book is well written, well documented, and very readable. I would recommend it to those who wish to explore the possibilities of how we have arrived at the pinnacle of Clinton's demise."
2,A little too much spin wrapped in a cloak of good research.,"Retter's book was dated before the ink dried. But that is the problem with authors who want to get a book out quickly. This rush to judgment, however, does not deminish his work. While he tries to be objective, and he succeeds in most cases, one can still see his susceptibility to the Clinton spin. I would love for him to put out another copy now that the report has been completed. I expect a free copy of the update and a dash more of objectivity."
3,Thrown Together but Instructive,"Retter fills in the blanks of what everyone THINKS he knows about the Clinton scandals. But the book is flawed by the arbitrary construction of its content and by its dwelling on the personalities and hypocrisies of the ""bad guys,"" which are ultimately beside the point. Gingrich's and Limbaugh's personal lives do not have a bearing on Clinton's tendencies to womanize, nor on Whitewater, and dwelling on their lives only makes the liberal case look weaker. A nice try at telling the story of the ""vast Right Wing conspiracy,"" but I think we still have to wait for a better, more sustained effort."
2,"Who named this ""Encyclopedia""???","In that book there is only one thing: many-many beautiful inspirational pictures. No more than this.If you see this book - I'm am sure you would want to make paper.But if you are a papermaker already and you need complete information about many aspects of papermaking - you would not find it in that book, you do not need this book absolutely!So, I think that there is only one reason to by this book - to inspire someone - may be kid or friend. That book can be a handsome gift. But may be you could find book which is beautifil and informative simultaneously."
5,Nice break....,Just a really neat book. Jack & Kira are a very sweet and sexy couple. Just the kind of book I like to read. Get this...
2,Disappointing,"Yes, its packs some hot sex scenes, but the dialog was ""off"" I did not enjoy this book and found myself skimming through the pages."
4,Not what I expected but nonetheless still a Good Purchase!,"The statue came to me as a shock, due to the small size. I guess I should have read the description more carefully next time. After all, the statue, itself, is sturdy. This is going to be a heck of a birthday present to me my sister, nonetheless. Recently, she started playing some Beethoven pieces, so I thought what better to get than a Beehtoven statue?"
4,Buy it now,"This is the best book for Christian parents of prodigals who need to get their lives back; at least it's the best I've found.Great practical advice and spiritual insights too. I particularly enjoyed and was helped by her discussion of prodigals who only return on the other side of Eternity. I've not had to walk that road yet, God willing I never will, but her messages of comfort can offer real solace to parents of prodigals."
3,Not the same as the movie,"I was expecting a longer, more detailed version of the movie but the story line is a bit different. The ending isn't as dramatic. It is a good story. It's just that I liked the movie better."
1,Chalky!,This product was too chalky! I'd rather swallow the big pills than choke through eating these huge wafers! You must also consume several wafers to meet the dosage.
4,Undiscovered Gem,"Having had the luxury of seeing Dirk play in his heydays of the ""Big Label"" era in the 1970's and 1980's and then again recently, I have to say he is still writing great material. He has the capacity to rock you and then in the next song --bring you to tears. I had the pleasure of him playing in my club last year and it was a joy to see him live again. I think Sufferupachuckle is one his most consistent and well produced efforts of his ""second career."""
5,"Excellent, Thrilling, And Adventurous","I enjoyed MAGGIE by Ann M. Matin a lot. I thought it was fun, thirlling, and exiciting. Maggie goes through a lot of family pressure by being rich. She wants to fit in and does it very well. She meets many friends who help her with her problems.I think Ann M. Martin is an excellent author. She acts and writes like a real teenage girl with these horrible problems."
3,Popular pre-teen reading material.,"From the author of ""The Baby Sitters Club,"" it's a series for a pre-teen audience, written in diary format. Maggie, thirteen, enjoys both writing poetry for her school newspaper and jamming with the band, and she has an undeveloped crush on a junior. Her successful father, a movie director, has more ""sophisticated"" pursuits in mind for her. Maggie, then, feels stress from her family, peers and school. The issues are familiar ones that teens will identify with. It will never become a classic, but is a good book to draw pre-teens to reading. Maggie's poetry is set in a printed font, distinguishing it from the rest of the text. The packaging is attractive, a glossy cover showing a worried, mature looking teenage Maggie."
4,pretty great!,"I think this is the best of the first three. Its really good, especially how she writes poems in the book. It lets you have an inside look at someone's life, like the other books. Its really good, even though sometimes she sounds wierd the way she words things. Overall it was great."
2,Not very realistic,"Well, I didn't like this book very much. Not much at all... I mean, how many people have rich fathers like that? It was SO predictable. NOT a good book...."
3,could have been great,"The characters in this video remind me of the female characters in dirty pair flash. The problem is that it is not long enough, this needed to be spread over several OVAs to define the characters and develope what would have been a great story."
5,Even a pro can learn a thing or two!,"As an award-winning professional event planner who has been in the business for over 15 years, I figured there probably wasn't a whole lot I was going to learn by reading Patty's book, but just in case there was, I thought I'd buy it. I'm so glad I did! There were TONS of ideas that I know will work not only for my clients' parties, but also will be fun to do when I'm planning a party for my own friends.Most are easy to duplicate and adapt to every situation...and Patty even provided a grid to help the ""thematically challenged"" find a theme to fit any occasion! :)The ideas are bulleted and easy to read. And if you need a little more of an explanation or ""how-to,"" Patty's provided that also for many of the projects.If you are a newbie host, or are like me, and have thrown hundreds...thousands...of parties, BUY THIS BOOK! You'll use it again and again."
5,A must-have for party planning!,"Because my family loves to party, I'm always looking for ideas that are easy and fun. Patty Sachs delivers again! Whenever I am planning a celebration, I know that her books will help... and this one is the best yet! The book makes finding ideas so simple. It's like having my own personal party planner! (Only less expensive!)"
2,A pretty much useless book,"This book is a waste of your money and time if you are looking for creative ideas for entertaining your party guests. Here is a statement for the New Year's Eve party: ""New Year's Eve celebration often includes the whole family, with game playing, lively competitions, music, and food."" (p.66). Yeah, right - this is extremely helpful to me to know when I am organizing such a party... Besides, this book does not have any concrete examples or suggestions on how to make parties fun. Instead of this book I would recommend one by Andrea Campbell ""Great Games for Great Parties"" - a lot more mileage for the same price."
2,lack of good ideas,"When I bought this book I was thinking that it will has a good ideas for parties but, it does not have any. There are a lot of good party book out there. Some of the ideas are too embarrassing to do with your guest. If you ask me to buy this book again, my answer will be not."
2,"This book is lacking on the ""how to's""","I'm always interested in new ideas for parties because I give at least 4 big (50 people or more) parties a year. This book did have plenty of ideas but very little in the way of concrete details. For example, under the MAGIC idea on page 94, Patty Sachs suggests for activities ""the guests perform amazing & amusing feats"" and that the host ""hire a professional magician to really dazzle & bewilder your guests."" This is helpful? This book is filled with truely lame and uninspired suggestions. A big disappointment. If you are looking for a party book, The Penny Whistle series is the way to go."
3,Good bra,"I purchased this bra because I was unable to get themin the store. It worked just fine and was exactlywhat I thought it would be. They fit very nicelybut the problems are the underwire pokes out afterjust a few months' use and they tend to fall apartrather quickly. I didn't seem to have this problemwith the ones I purchased in the store, but theonline purchase seemed to be lesser quality."
5,Good and Comfortable,"I have worn this style bra for a few years and am very pleased with it. I think it is well made and comfortable. My local store no longer stocks it, so I was pleased to find it on Amazon at a good price. Thank you Amazon!"
2,Comfortable bra but won't buy another one.,"The customer service with this seller was fantastic but the bra itself has little to be desired. Yes it's comfy but that straps loosen and fall, I have to keep readjusting myself and I have verified it's the correct size. I won't return it just won't order another one."
4,Good Support and comfortable,I have always worn this style bra and find it comfortable and it gives good support. Will order more in different colors.
5,File under Pop,"I am humming Track 6 ""It's Easy"" all day as it is just one of several sweet pop pieces of artwork.Put this in your Top Fifty 90's classics, they outdo Teenage Fanclub at Teenage Fanclub."
5,Dutch classic,"In the mid-90's a Dutch label started that would change the look of Dutch alternative music. Excelsior Records started out with a small but impressive list of groups: Daryll-Ann, Caesar and Johan. Later came additions and now it's a big indie label with maybe obscure names, but very good groups.This album was one of the first to come out on that label and was deemed to be so good that the Spinart label brought it out in the US.It's a Dutch classic, the perfect indie-guitar album. Beatles, Bowie, Sebadoh. Never too loud or pointy like the Pixies or Dinosaur but also never too soft.The early Excelsior groups had their bit of melancholy and so has this one. The beautiful 'Swing', the fast 'December' or the Pavement tribute ""Payment"" (beware of the few notes of Silence Kit, very well done).They only bring out an album once every 5 years so 2 have followed which are also very good, but they are 90's whereas this one is a perfect score."
4,We like Pocoyo,"This is a pretty well created show compared to the others that are out there and one I don't mind watching. The characters are cute and the stories are pretty good. Not sure it will be a show my son will like for a long long time, because it is geared toward younger kids, but he enjoys it now. He is only a year, and while he doesn't just stare at the tv while it's on, he does like to watch it while playing with his toys. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good cartoon for young children."
5,Pocoyo DVD,We bought this DVD for our granddaughter for Christmas..She really loves it..It is very educational for her..Great teaching tool for young children..
4,Lucas loves it!,"The DVD isn't HD, and it doesn't contain a lot of episodes. But my son loves it! It's also interesting to see how this show is low stimulus by removing unecessary environmental clutter in it's visual presentation. Kids can focus on the character and key elements presented on the white background. The stories are also cute and have a postivie message. Besides, how can you not love that ridiculous duck, Pato?"
3,Nice Chisel,"This is a nice England made chisel however, it was not honed like the description said, and it is a lightweight chisel not very heavy duty. But, must 1/8 inch chisels don't need to be heavy duty."
4,Catch-22 in Vietnam,"This book is to Vietnam War novels what ""Catch-22"" is to World War II novels: bitter, surreal, absurd, entertaining, and a valuable commentary on that specific war. Charles Durden was a freelance correspondent in Vietnam, and he has an ear for the language and an understanding of the attitudes of the combat soldiers. He pinpoints the horror of killing, which is for many worse than the fear of death, and he sketches the frustrations of a pointless war in which the unwilling were often led by the incompetent -- or worse. The grunts of Kilo Company arrive in Vietnam and are soon faced with the absurdity of the war; they respond in an interesting variety of ways from that of the skilled and capable lieutenant, ""The Boy Ranger,"" to the deserter and traitor, ""Jinx."" Do not read this book as a true story of what happened in Vietnam but rather as a realistic picture of what war was like there."
3,semi happy,It's made of pretty thin plastic.Afraid sun will warp it in time!we'll see. The fit was good and looks good It's only about 3'16th thick not shure how much protection it will offer .More for show than go.But thats really all i was looking for
2,for jazz fans,"Well,i'm not a jazz fan and i don't think it's the music style that suitsChaplin's music.Anyway if you like jazz this could be your disc."
4,Beautiful Voice Wasted!,"I love Lea Salonga and was thrilled to get her new album. Her voice is a gift from the gods. So beautiful, clear, sweet, yet powerful. The songs on her album do not do her justice. Filled with sugar coated pop ballads, Lea is never allowed to vocally soar like she does on the Miss Saigon recording. A few songs like The Journey, Remind My Heart, and I Honestly Love You are quite beautiful, but the rest of the songs are not very memorable. I can't even think of any to include in this review except for the ones mentioned. Lea would have been better off putting out a collection of Broadway show tunes so the world could really learn to appreciate this stunning vocalist. Recommended for all Miss Saigon fans, but for pop music fans just stick to the Britneys and Christina[s]."
3,"CD needs more Lea, less studio","Lea fanatics will undoubtedly be pleased by any opportunity to hear her sing. Her popularity, however, arises from her beautiful voice, which is buried beneath the studio augmentation in this CD. Bad singers need the help of a studio. Lea does not. Although I like a few of the songs on this album, most are uninspired and very forgettable."
2,"Not Lea Salonga's best effort, through no fault of her own .","I am a huge fan of Lea Salonga who was disappointed with her signature CD. Like other Amazon reviewers, I agree that the background accompaniment completely overpowers Ms. Salonga's lovely voice on most - if not all - of the tracks. Those wishing to hear Lea's vocals in the same calibre as ""Miss Saigon"", ""Les Mis"" or ""Mulan"" will be disappointed - this CD does not approach those efforts."
3,A great talent obscured by heavy handed production,"Don't get me wrong, Miss Salonga is a tremendous talent. I recently had the chance to see her in person in Miss Saigon. I was somewhat dissapointed by this disc however. It struck me as badly over-produced. Too much instrumentation, too many backup vocals, long pop-ish fades, heavy processing of the vocals... I often wished they would just be quiet and let me hear her sing (and she CAN sing!). Compared to the production qualities on Bernadette Peter's lovely ""I'll be Your Baby Tonight"" this disc comes up sorely wanting. I can only hope we will get another opportunity to hear her marvelous talent in a clear, simple presentation"
3,Lea has better albums..,"Although this was Lea's first international release, many of the people from the US don't know that she had already released two albums in Asia, One in 1997 entitled ""In Love"" and another in 1999 entitled ""By Heart"". If you want to hear the whole wonderful voice of Lea with less of the instruments and backup vocals, try to get hold of copies of the last two albums. Here, her crisp and clear voice springs out from the deepest of all emotions. Hope I was able to help"
1,"nice voice, but weak choice of songs","Indeed, lea salonga has a nice voice. Proof would be her clear crystal voice in various recordings. Her weakness: her acting. Being objective, listen to her on other CDs like this one, Flower Drum, her manila concert, it all sounds the same. and it gets to be boring as you listen to her over and over again. she cannot seem to offer something new. It is like miss saigon over and over again.in this cd, she pulls the same tricks. no variety. all songs sound the same, there is no progression. and, the choice of songs are bad as well, she cannot do anything interesting with the material. Please offer something new. and btw, she sounds like liz callaway..."
5,Wonderful!,"This CD is a must have for any lover of Musical Theater! Lea Salonga is one of the greatest female singers alive, and this CD proves it! Get it, you won't regret it!"
4,Lea's singing voice is truly great,"Lea's voice is great but is sometimes drowned by too much instrumentation. I love to listen to ""The Journey"", which, I think is the best song in the CD."
3,Only a few tracks truely reflect Lea's vocial talents.,"To those who have fallen for her siren voice, this album contains a few tracks that will provide acoustic euphoria, most notably the last track, ""The Journey"". There is also a duet with Brad Kane (the singing voice of Aladdin), but this number is not as memorable as their endeavor with ""A Whole New World."" As a whole this album lacks consistency. But take it apart and focus on certain tracks, and this CD is a gold mine waiting to be discovered."
1,Lea Salonga CD,"Am a great fan of Salonga's voice. This CD has back-ups on drums, bass who think they are the soloists. Bad arrangements, hard to hear Salonga singing. She should make a CD with only one or two instruments (piano or guitar) so that her great voice is enjoyed. David Gannaway"
3,not quite what I like,"I love Lea's voice but I'm not a fan of pop music which is what this CD is. I simply can't get past the pop style of the songs but if you like that kind of music then you'll probably like this CD. Personally, I prefer her broadway performances over this because I like that kind of music better.As was said in some of the other reviews, if you're a huge die-hard Lea Salonga fan then get this CD. If you're not then you can probably do without it especially if you don't like pop music."
2,The phone book,"The old cliché goes...""She has such a great voice that she could sing the phone book and sound good!"" It's too bad that Miss Salonga recorded the phone book with this album. The songs truly are dismal but hey, what a voice!"
2,I'm selling it.,"Her voice is magical in shows in which she has that performed. The CD was lacking in power, passion, and diversity of theme. Its focus of only relationships and love was disappointing. Her voice could reflect so much more."
2,"Lea Salonga, Debbie Gibson, Glen Madeiros...","These artists all belong in the same category.But hey ~Like what Debbie Gibson once said:""You can't always be that cheesy forever"".I'll be honest. I liked the album the first time I heard it, but hearing it again today almost reminds of going back to time when my world was - still simple. Guess I could say I know better now.As for the album. She should stick to her stage musicals and voiceovers. That's where the talent in her vocals truly belong. Unless these songs from this album were blended in the form of animations or musicals then I'd say these songs might've been taken a little seriously, but I've always noticed her voice could and would never fall into a Pop genre category."
3,Not Bad!!!,"The song selections are good but her voice isn't moving enough to compete with younger genre. Songs are specially crafted but there is nothing extra special in her voice that would allow her tp compete with other pop stars. Her simple melodic voice is good in singing disney characters but not pop music.... she sounded like Debbie Gibson in the '80s!!!!For fans and easy listening goers, this is not a bad album. She sounded so sweet, considering that she is a broadway artist. Lea Salonga is indeed one of those artist with a simple talent but lots of intelligence and wit."
5,One of the best singers of our time!,I wish I had learned about this album much earlier! Ms. Salonga has such a wonderful voice I can't listen enough to her music. I hope she does more recordings and that amazon.com makes available to U.S. fans her hit albums produced in the Philippines.
3,Lea Salonga is the BEST!!,"I agree with a lot of the reviewers... Lea Salonga has got one of the beautiful voices in the world, her voice is 5+++++ stars but the songs in this CD doesn't do her any justice. I would only give 1-2 stars for the songs as there are only a few that I really like and really think bring out the clearness of her voice. It is good to see her trying out other types of songs but her voice is just too beautiful for these pop songs. I think her CDs which are only released in Philipines (and her recording for Miss Saigon, Les Miserables, Aladdin and Mulan) are better. I hope Amazon will sell those CDs. Otherwise you can get those CDs from Ebay. The few songs that I think are quite good are: ""It's Just GoodBye"",""We could be in Love"", ""Remind My Heart"",""I Honestly Love You"", and ""The Journey""."
3,Great voice. Pity about the songs.,"If only Lea Salonga had better songwriters. Her renditions of the covers are excellent and very refreshing. It's just a real pity the rest of the songs, though musically above average, have awkward lyrics such as ""Forward always forward. Onwards always up (! ). Catching every drop of hope in my empty cup (? )"". Empty CUP?"
4,Only NOW do people recognize her?,"This is a good albom. Not the best, but clearly a great example of what Lea is capable of doing. For those true Lea fans... i wold reccomend buying her Filipino album, which is an even better display of her vocal talents. However, i would like to comment mainly on the dats of some reviews? How long has lea's album been up for sale on the internet? I bought her album in 1995, but most reviews of it are posted in 1999 or 1998. we used her song ""It's Just Goodbye"" as a graduation song! In a way, this might greatly affect how people listen to the music. In 1995, her songs would have sounded so much better ebcause that was the type of music which was popular at the time. Music has evolved so much since that time, and that completely changes how the album is looked at."
3,Very pleasant and enjoyable.,"When I first lislened to this CD I was dissapointed. But some things get better with time and today, the song-'we could be in love' is my all time favorite song by Lea. The CD is nice to lislen to and is great background music. She should release another album in the US though. I still hold high hopes on her."
2,"Everyman is redundant and self-evident, did I mention boring","Okay Mr. ""I love Everyman"", I also am an AP High school student and am portraying Everyman in our High School production of the Everyman and trust me, the story is reptitious, boring, anti-climatic and fails to actually captivate an audience unless drastic revisions are incorporated. The morals are good, but the lines are superficial."
2,1 sided only,"Well I feel like I was tricked with this leash. It is only Glitter on one side. And it looks stupid walking my dog when the non glitter side shows.I wish they would have shown it in the pictures. Only used it once, I am much temped to return the leash."
3,Well made,Made and designed good. It has a place for all your tools. In fact you can put so many tools in it that it becomes hard to carry around that's why I stopped using it. Perfect for some people just wasn't for me.
4,Great First Impression,"Just received and not yet used, but it appears to be solidly made, so overall I'm pleased with it. Except that for 20 clams, I would not expect to see even the slight machining indentation along half the outside of the bowl that I received; a minor point, but this would be considered a second at better stores so minus one star. It's deep and has a narrow but sturdy rim; and I like its intermediate size. Should prove very useful in the kitchen."
3,Greatest hits?,"I used to love Hall & Oates. These 2 CDset almost made me fall asleep! That is, the FILLER songs did! I fell for the 2 CD compilation ""stuff"". The BEST is on this CD set, but some rather boring filler. I guess die hard fans might like this; the filler songs (non top 40 hits) bored me..."
2,Oats?,"Never understood why They were called Hall&Oats,when Oats never did anything,Not even the guitar solos.They were done by G.E.Smith.Even when my wife drug me to one of their concerts it was more like the Daryl Hall show.Anyhow,I realy liked the 70,s music of Daryl Hall(Sara,s smile,Rich Girl,The stewerdes song.)Got turnd off of the 80,stuff though(Kiss on my list,Did it in a minut.)he went from being soulful to just silly."
2,Hall and Oates CD,"Shipment was recieved at a reasonable rate. In great condition, brand new. This product consisted of 2 CD's. The first CD had great classic Hall and Oates songs but the second CD wasn't that impressive. Could have gotten the one CD and been satisfied. Description was accurate and helpful."
2,Guess my memory is failing....,"I spontaneously ordered this CD thinking of the good ole days. I guess my memory is fading because there were very few songs that I actually liked. Even my husband wondered ""what the heck did you buy this for?"" My own fault, not Hall & Oates."
4,More Hall & Oates than the casual fan will need,"I was never a huge fan of Hall & Oates though I grew up hearing them on the radio all the time. I bought this collection mostly out of nostalgia, and it is of very high quality in terms of sound and packaging. However it contains a significant number of songs that I don't recognize at all, particularly on disc 1, and mostly from the 1970s. Still, it's hard to criticize a music collection for having more than you really wanted, and I can always skip the songs I don't like. I burned myself a highlights disc and I've been playing that instead. I will also say that the collection contained a bunch of hits from the 1980s that I knew but had forgotten which was a very pleasant surprise."
5,"""Now I can see loves taken her toll on me""","She's gone. This song got worn out by commercial radio in the late 70's. It sort of faded away from the radio. There was a time that I said ""if I hear this f#@$ing song one more time""... Now it seems to have a new meaning or new life to me. Daryl Hall has one of music's most distinctive and soulful voices. When he hits those high notes, it still gives me goose bumps."
5,Hall and Oates at their best,This compilation album by Hall and Oates not only has their most famous hits but it opens your eyes to their less well known songs of equal quality and fervor. I can listen to this album over and over again and because of this i give it five stars.
4,80's fan,"I got this as a Christmas gift and I love it. I was a Hall & Oates fan when I was a teen in the 80's and they are still great to listen to now. It has a lot of the songs I loved but then they have a lot of older stuff too. There are a few hits they missed, but it still a really good CD."
3,Not quite enough to fill 2 discs,"Loved Hall & Oates ever since I was a kid. They were actually my first concert. As I got older and got into more progressive types of music, they sort of fell by the wayside in my collection, and I lost most of the early to mid 80s CDs I had. But recently I became nostalgic for their hits again (In the midst of a larger 80s nostalgia trip), so I decided to get this disc. I debated getting the older single-disc Hits cd, but opted for this instead as it was only a few bucks more. This was the only CD that had all the songs I wanted, but on two discs. Unfortunately, to get everything I wanted, I also had to deal with some of their less quality tunes, which is not a problem, but I think they could really make an excellent H&O; greatest hits to fit on a single CD. In fact, I think I'm gonna rip the two CDs and pare them down to a single 80 minute perfect compilation.Also, the CD case shipped completely cracked. Thanks Amazon!"
4,Best collection to date,"There have been countless Hall and Oates compilations released over the years and none of them have been as extensive as this one. Some came close but would skip over the early years and miss key tracks like ""She's Gone"". This particular track is my personal favourite, and you cannot beat the original album version included here. I believe Hall and Oates re-recorded it in the late 70's or early 80's into a shorter mix.This compilation is digitally remastered and includes album tracks and every single, except for ""OOh Yeah"" and the medley from ""Live at the Appollo"" (""My Girl""?). Besides those two omissions, I think all fans owe it to themselves to grab a copy. Some key standouts are ""How does it feel to be back"", ""One On One"", ""Don't Hold Back Your Love"" ""So Close"" and ""Rich Girl"".This is a very easy album to listen to. Buy it for the original version of ""She's Gone"" if anything. LOVE THAT SONG!"
5,Highly Entertaining,An insightful look at the world of jet car racing. This documentary does not shy away from any aspect and shows the highs as well as the lows. Highly entertaining
5,Hart Bros,Enjoyed the stories of Simon & Callaghan. Always good for a second reading. Diana Palmer is a favorite.
5,The Hart Brother Callagan & Simon,This book was wonderful. I like the way the author incorporates romance with a wonderful sense of humor. Great Book!!
4,Not her best but close,You have certainty of the outcome but that doesn't change the building suspense. All my daughters read Linda's books too and it's being passed around the family right now. The three of us who have already read it love it.
4,Glory glory Linda lael miller,As always Linda L. Miller has written a very spell bounding novel .she really keep her readers turning the pages till the end . Great read
4,Linda Lael Miller Fan,"I'm a big fan of Linda Lael Miller and have read almost all of her books. They're all great, as far as I'm concerned, but some are more great that others. :) This one is one of her better books. Enjoy!"
2,"Glory, Glory","I love LLM books and have read several and have kept most of them; however, I was disappointed with this one. Ms. Miller did a great job with building up the tension between the two characters, explaining the past, explaining what happened for the heroine to leave at such a young age, and you could ""feel"" the love that they both felt, but I felt the reconciliation in the end was poorly written. It was a complete disappointment. It was a matter of four words and that was it. I didn't even keep this one."
4,Glory Glory,Like all LLM books I loved this one. The only thing I did not like was that I finished it way to fast. It's one of those books you don't want to put down.
2,"Glory, Glory","I like Linda Lael Miller's stories, but it seems that with each book she writes, her descriptions become more pronographic. I don't need, or want, to know the in depth details of every sex act in the book. She's gone too far....she'd be better off leaving something to the imagination!"
1,Disappointing - Not Recommended,"This is not a good book. It presents remarkably little information. The pages are filled with large, useless screen shots. Page 66 (as another example) is a step-by-step process for creating a text file in Notepad including when to press Enter at each line break. Chapter 11 (page 201) is entitled ""Working with Hyperlinks"" -- more than half way through the book. I wanter to learn more about ASPs than I could get from Microsoft's Web site. I didn't. Now I'm looking for a better book."
1,Neither for the beginners nor for intermediate or advanced.,I feel I have lost my US$32 after getting it. It is neither for the beginners nor for the intermediate or advanced readers. It is written in haphazard and confused manner.
5,Husband loves this,"I got this as a gift for my husband, and he absolutely loves it. I got it for him nearly a year ago, and he still uses it often when he shaves. It smells very nice--it smells strongly of limes, but in a nice way (more like key lime pie than household cleaner). I would consider getting the same product in a different scent. I would also highly suggest this as a gift for any man who is into shaving."
2,"nice, but...","I can't say the coffee tastes BAD as far as coffees go, plain coffees. But I ordered Irish Creme flavor, and Irish Creme it Ain't. Not at ALL. You really have to search for even a hint of ANY flavoring, and even then you catch maybe a hint of creamy something, and an even tinier suggestion of rum or something. But no Irish Creme. Not at all.Very disappointing since it's nearly impossible to find Irish Creme in any local stores, and that is why I resorted to ordering it from here and from what seemed to be a respectable brand in the first place. Only I didn't find it here either as it turns out. Blah.I guess the search goes on. Only now I have to figure out what to do with the other three bags..."
2,save your money,"This book was a total let down. Too much material is glossed over. This is probably a great guide for a kid doing a school project--but it just doesn't cover as much material as other books at the same price. For example it states that you can find info from genealogical societies , research centers and libraries. No societies or libraries are then listed right there in the book. A paltry few societies are listed in the back. I just finished The genealogy sourcebook by Sharon Debarto Carmack--which is absolutely fabulous!!! Maybe if I read the boks in the reverse order I would have a higher opinion of the Reader's digest version. On second thought--probably not!!!!!"
3,A big disappointment,I was disappointed to find that this book tells you how to apply the information you have on the web so that others who are looking have it. I am cautious about placing personal information on the web because you don't know who might collect it and then use it to steal your identity or create problems in other areas of your private life. I was looking for ways to go the the national data banks to find out information and I felt this book did not fill that need. Jean Schweer
4,Never believe music critics...,"I guess I must be in a minuscule un-intellectual minority, since I have never managed to file away this ""comedy"" CD after two spins through my CD player as Mr. DeRogatis suggests. Rather than dismissing this CD as another ""comedy"" album, I would point out John Hall's humor is more satire than comedy. Who knows...perhaps the aforementioned critic missed the literature class where the Professor explained the difference between the two genres. No matter really. Being a stubborn Irish sort that appreciates satire (O! Jonathan Swift!) I'll keep listening to the CD. Give it a try and prove yet another music critic wrong."
5,Number one,I have stuied many books. I found this book is very useful for the reader who are working on groundwater field. I think this is one of the best book in this field.
4,Great at first...,"This brush removed all the built up plaque, but then after couple brushings the bristles came out in my mouth!! Never had that before w/ any brush??"
2,the upstairs room!,"I would only recommend this book to people who want an easy read. This is because it was boring, every page was the same and there was little excitement. You always knew what was going to happen next, the author's way of writing was very plain and there was little detail. Every chapter was about living in hiding and how bored they got. Once in awhile something exciting happened, like the German soldiers came to the house. It was hard to concentrate because I didn't find the book interesting. Also, I didn't find any connections to the characters. They were both older. Also, I have never hid with my life on the line. I would recommend this book to people looking for something easy to ready, with little excitement."
5,The Upstairs Room is a book about...,"The Upstairs Room The Upstairs Room is a book about the Second World War. It tells about Annie de Leeuw, who is a Jewish girl in Holland. Soon Annie and one of her to sisters have to go into hiding together because of the Germans. They hid with the Oostervelds, a nice little family who lived on a farm in the town of Usselo. Then Annie and Sini, her sister, are built a hiding place in a closet incase of a German raid. Then one night they have to use it. The Upstairs room is a great book that I recommend to any one who likes books about World War 2. It is a good book that any one who can read should read this book."
3,The upstairs room..,The writing is a bit choppy and hard to read at times. The story itself is great. There is quite a bit of bad language though. So I can't recommend it to younger children.
3,A Review of one of the Many books I've read.,"This book is about a family that has been seperated when going into hiding because they are Jewish. The Upstairs room centers itself on how the youngest girl, Annie, goes throught the Holocaust with her sisters, how she lives, what she eats, and what she learns of the war. I recommend this book for a younger reader because this book is slow paced."
4,The Upstairs Room,The Upstairs Room is a very touching and loving story about two young girls trying to hide from Hitler and his troops. Hitler is a person who demands that all Jews are to be put in a special camp.Annie and her sister learn to actually cooperate with each other while hiding. The part i liked the most about the story was when Annie and her little sister were hiding under the bed because i thought the way they described it was very detailedful.
2,"Good concept, could have been better","The story is good. I liked the concept and the idea. I think that the writing in this particular is more for younger childre, more of an elementary level. The story moved to fast. There were not enough details given to support what was going on. In my opinion, you didn't get to know the characters well enough. They didn't really develope. There was just a brief description at the begining. Also, it was to choppy. The story didn't flow very smoothly. Next, some parts were unclear. Such as when a person was speaking. A few people were talking and there was no name in front of the speech so you didn't always know who was talking. Finally, at parts of importance, there was no stress to make them seem more important. The writing could have been more descriptive so you get a good picture of what's goiong on. Some other books about the holocaust that are a little more descriptive are ""The Devil's Arithmatic"" and ""Number the Stars."""
5,A Struggle to Strive,"I recommend this book, The Upstairs Room to anyone who likes a good book. This book takes place during the Holocaust. I think this book is the best, I have ever read. It was full of excitement, and history. It tells about a little girl and her sister who have to go into hiding with different families. If you read and like the Diary of Anne Frank you will love this book. The diary of Anne frank was a true story and this is also a true story it's based on the girls life."
4,The Upstairs Room,"I really enjoyed The Upstairs Room by Johanna Reiss. It was one of the very few books that has kept me pulled in and interested the entire time. The characters were real, and the story gave distinct detail about their physical appearances and individual personalities. It shows the struggle of a Jewish family trying to stay together, and most of all stay alive. You feel as though you are right there with the characters though every life threatening account with the German Nazi's.The people who will like this book are individuals that may be interested in World War II, or the history of Germany and Holland during the 1940's. This could also be intriguing for people who enjoy reading about life struggles and how people have overcome them."
4,Life in Hiding!,"This book, unlike other books about this topic, has a happy ending, which I like. It has thrilling parts, like when the German soldiers came and searched the Oostervelds' house. It was a short, easy read that you could put down, but not abandon. If you are interested in the topic of WWII you would like this book."
2,I really don't like this book,"This is about the book ""The Upstairs Room"" by Johanna Reiss. This book takes place in Holland during the Holocaust. The main character is a worried nine year old Jewish girl named Annie that had to hide in a backroom for years and couldn't go outside, she also hid underground. She has two sisters (Sini and Rachel). It reminds me of a wonderful Holocaust book called "" Parallel Journeys"".The theme of the book was to treat all men equal. It wasn't fair that Hitler made the Jews hide and kill them. It's like the pharse "" Treat others as you want to be be treated yourself"". I didn't like the book because nothing exciting happend, I didn't like all the cuss words, I also didn't like all the crying and hugging, and I'm more interested in boys being the main character because I am one.I recommend this book to a girl in sixth grade or above because the main character is a girl, it has a lot of dramatic parts, and the cuss words are inapropriate."
4,The Upstairs Room,I think the book The Upstairs Room was very good. I liked how it explained what life could be like for Jews during the Holocaust without going into any really terrible details. It was nice to read a book about a Jew that was in hiding because it makes you understand that you shouldn't take things for granted. It was inspiring to read about a girl my age that survived the Holocaust but was in hiding for 2 years. I think this is a great book and you should definitely read it. I enjoyed it very much.
3,Florida Lifestyle,"This is a nice roll up bamboo for the price but, don't expect it to block all sunlight. I would reccomend it more for the asthetics than the coverage expected. It is pretty with outdoor bamboo or wicker resin furniture. I ended up ordering a custom made blind from Lowe's. That I would really recommend if you live in Florida or in warm, sunny weather."
3,Not the best copy,"I just bought this book and the story is exactly as I remember it, but I am a little disappointed by the quality of the book. The pages look as if they are simply color copies of an older book and are printed on one side only. I had also thought that the original German verses were included in this version, but they are not. I like the book, just wish I could have looked at this version before I bought it."
5,Effective,"My mother is German and she read this book to me all the time when I was a child. It teaches lesson about playing w/matches, teasing people, not eating dinner, running with scissors...etc. I never did any of those things after reading this book. A must for parents."
5,Der Strwwelpeter,"This is a classic German children's book. My parents read this to me when I was a child; it was one of my favorite books. The book teaches children about manners. It teaches you that when you do something wrong, there are consequences. Der Struwwelpeter was originally written about 150 years ago."
5,Childhood Memories,"I did not expect to find german childhood stories on Amazon. Nice surprise, it's just like I remembered them when I was growing up. I also ordered other german childhood stories...I am just thrilled to add something from the past into my present enjoyments."
4,Kuralt a journalist's inspiration,"I have looked in vain for any sort of anthology of the ""On The Road"" vignettes of Charles Kuralt. This television biography was fine, as far as it went, but I wish CBS, or somebody, would put out a DVD or two with the best of Charles Kuralt. He was one of my inspirations for a career in broadcast journalism."
2,Is This Really Good Rock?,"I think the music is acceptable but could be better. I like the vocals and I think Kelsey Friday is very good singer, but I think that that the guitar could be alot better and more creative(not the greatest). I know alot of guitarists that can play better than this guy including myself, but he is adequate I guess. The other musicusicians are somewhat talented also like the drummer and the bassist. They just need someone to write some better songs and guitar parts for them and they could be a really good band. Replace the guitarist and maybe you will see some better results."
5,Utterly Fantastic!,"I've been a Brownie Mary fan for a year or so now, and this CD delivers big-time. It has all the energy that the band has in their live shows with all their best songs. I hear they're going back in the studio soon, and all I can say is, they're gonna have to work damn hard to top this one."
5,Brownie Mary: The best band you've never heard of,"I first heard brownie mary because my guitarist's dad Kevin Raleigh was their manager and got us free tickets to their show. I've seen this band 4 times, and even opened for them once. They are amazing! Kelsea is hot and amazing! Their CD, ""Naked"", should be on VH-1's Ultimate albums. It's still a mystery to me why they aren't at the same status as No Doubt, Fleetwood Mac, or Veruca Salt. In my opinion, they're better than all three.-Bob C."
5,Western cowboy in a sci fi nightmare,"Mount Dragon is one of those rare novels where the less you know, before you read it, the better.One of Preston & Child's absolute best! Don't miss it!"
4,Very Enjoyable. I Read it in One Night!!,"I very much enjoyed reading this novel. Preston & Child have teamed up to give the reader an easy yet exciting presentation. Timely in topic and terrifying in characters, ""Mount Dragon"" is a generally good read."
4,A Good Page Turner,"I really liked this book. The thought of manipulating dangerous viruses to create truly world ending strains is scarry. Besides the science there is a small bit of history and Spanish instruction thrown in.The descriptions of what happens in virtual cyber space are phenominal. However, I felt that the plot of the book seemed to go a little overboard toward the end. Otherwise I would have rated this 5 stars."
4,Another winner for Preston & Child,"I have read a number of books by these tag-team writers and have enjoyed all of them. This is another that I can recommend to anyone who is a fan of the medical thriller.The plot is straightforward: discover a cure for influenza which involves altering our DNA. Of course, you have your ego-maniac who wants to profit from the discovery and your hero who wants to help humanity.All in all, a great read and one I can thoroughly recommend."
4,Good read,"Very fast-paced and exciting. A few of the characters could have been better developed, but i would still recommend it to my friends and family."
4,The awesome power of medical technology gone wrong.,"Mount Dragon is a laboratory in the Southwest, funded by an extremely weathly computer whiz. They have developed somesuposed medical treatments that will revolutionize the world, or so they say. Or have they really created a horrible killer that takesits slow time in destroying it's victims? Another gripper by this wonderful pair. Couldn't put this one down either. Intermixed with the techno-dramaare the characters that overlap, yet stand alone and interact with each other in a very authentic way. Lots of twists and turns throughout the storythat keep you flipping pages well into the wee hours of the night. Check out their other book, Relic."
3,Mount Dragon,I'm a fan of the Pentergast novels and wanted to read some of the ones I'd missed. I bought Mount Dragon thinking it was a Pentergast book so I was a little disappointed. The story itself was very good as all of theirs are. Definitely worth the time spent reading it.
5,Incredible Story,"Mount Dragon is an incredible story. Even though this is fiction, it opens a world of medical experiments that the average person would not even think could happen. As usual Douglas Preston keeps you right into the book until the end."
4,Very scary medical thriller,"A hidden research comples in the desert of New Mexico sets a stage for the greatest minds of our time. They are working privately on the biggest medical breakthrough of our time. What they get instead is the biggest threat to our civilization. Now, out of control and about to get loose into our environment, the scientists must confront their evil-creation and stop it, facing the hardest decisions of their lives. Great medical thriller that is extremely scary in its implications of what could be going on somewhere out there in some secret lab."
2,Below P&C's usual standard,"I discovered Preston & Child a few months ago with the fascinating and thrilling Brimstone trilogy. I have ordered all of their novels and have not been disappointed until this one. I considered just dropping it, but made it through to the end this morning. Compared to the other books, the surprises here were minimal. The desert journey just went on and on, and the lost gold subplot was unnecessary. The writing was at times hackneyed, especially Carson's western ""lingo."" I really missed the presence of a complex, interesting character such as Pendergast or the Ice Limit's Eli Glenn. Finally, graphic depictions of animal suffering really bother me, and I thought they were overdone throughout this book. Oh well, onward to Relic..."
3,JUST OK,"Having read the Relic and Riptide, I was expected another fun fast pace read. It started out well but then went downhill from there. The last 1/3 of the book was a total drag. I guess every author(s) has some off books and I think this one was it."
3,"Bad science, average story.",Preston/Child have fallen into a rut with mad scientists. As in Cabinet of Curiosities we are confronted with brilliant evil scientists who may cause the total extinction of mankind. All this to prevent the flu! The premise is absurd. The science is bad and boring. Why did they leave the supernatural themes of Relic and Reliquary where we could willingly suspend our skepticism for the sake of a good story. This is a very average work which could easily have been written by Robin Cook. If you want a medical genetics thriller try Greg Bear's Darwin's Radio.
2,subplots are bad!,"A promising idea, combining so many of todays fears about technology, all wrapedup in about, oh say 20 subplots! okay, not that many, but enough to make me forget the plot in the first place. Preston and Child have more talent than what they gave us here, and it's painful to look at their far superior ""Relic"" and believe that it came from the same people. Lets hope that they brush up on their basic writing skills before they attempt another novel."
2,Mount Disappointment,"After loving ""Relic"", I raced out to buy ""Mount Dragon"" as soon as it was released (in hardcover, yet). Whooee - what a crushing disappointment it was. The opening chapter was a real grabber, but it was all downhill after that. These guys obviously research their science material well. However, in this book they didn't give me any characters I cared about in the least. Fortunately, ""Mount Dragon"" appears to be a brief stumble for Child and Preston. Their subsequent books are all worth the read. I cannot recommend ""Mount Dragon""."
3,Did anyone check the Kindle version for spelling and typos??,I have been reading several Preston Child books including to 2 new one that just came out. Mount Dragon has too many typos and it really detracts from the story and the pleasure of the read for this reader. I hope in that this can be fixed in any up coming books coming out on the Kindle. Thank you for your attention regarding this matter in advance.
3,My least favorite Preston/Child,"Decent writing but failed to engage me as all their other novels have taken me along for the ride. The scenes where they're in cyberspace of the company were boring and tedious for me to get through (and silly?) and I couldn't wait to be through them. And there was something in the writing that reminded me of the novel BLASPHEMY in its tone, too much.I have now read all Preston/Child novels. This was the last hold-out. All in all, my own personal opinion was that this one just wasn't up to par with the rest."
3,Just ok,I've read quite a few book by these 2 and this was not one of my favorites. The story was a bit predictable and there really was not a character worth rooting for. I expect better from these guys
3,Robuster,Not a easy read.Complex.This book is somewhat out of their usual mode. Not a bad story but you must be devoted to it. Not a book you can skim through. I found that at the end it was worth the effort.The book was published years ago and can be found at a local used book store for a quarter.This price is awful.
3,"Great Start, Side Tracked Ending...",Mount Dragon is the first book I have read by Preston & Child. And the first 2/3 of the book is excellent. It has great mystery and plot that builds to a climax. I have to admit it was hard to put down. Then in the third act the book goes on a needless chase scene that lacks the focus of the first part of the book. It started like Andromida Strain or Outbreak and ended like a boring desert adventure...
2,"Love these guys, not so much this book","I have read everything by these two, and this book was a huge disappointment. While the plot seemed like a really interesting concept, I didn't ever really feel like they cared about the characters. Unless you are trying to win a bet, I would skip this one."
3,Dragon Mount,"I'm not sure who is responsible for the drafting of the book into the kindle format, however, this book has been a HUGE disappointment to me because of all the typos. The story line itself is normal in the aspect of telling a chilling piece of fiction, or is it truth? story... however the typos really got to me. Normally when I buy a hard copy of a book and there are typos in it, I write to the publishing house. After all, we should be getting a ""perfect"" copy for the money we are spending to acquire said book, be it hardcopy or an e-book. It's a good thing this did not cost me over $8, because I'd be yelling for my money back!come on people... use spellcheck at least!!"
4,Kept My Interest,"Very good read; hard to put down. Not one of my favorite Preston/Child books, but still very good. I love their smooth writing style. Good character development. Interactions between the characrters were realistic. You can feel the warmth or antagonism between the characters. Good sense of place. I have visited New Mexico on several occasions. While reading this book, I was reminded of the colors, smells, sounds, textures, and the hot and cold temps that I experienced in the desert. The story itself was interesting, although we may have come across similar themes in other books or movies. The plot took some interesting turns. I thought that the Cyphersphere did not contribute much to the story, but I liked how it was used in the ending."
3,Classic Preston & Child,"I enjoyed Mount Dragon as much as other Preston & Child books, although Relic is still tops, but the Kindle version of Mount Dragon had numerous typographical errors. It was so much that they really started annoying me. Could have been reviewed better for editing mistakes."
4,Unique Ideas And A Good Plot,"This is my first foray into the bestselling work of this well-known tandem. Probably I should have started with Relic, but we saw the movie and it was ridiculous, which is why I've avoided Preston & Child until now. I have to say I wasn't disappointed. Mount Dragon is a strong thriller with great science and more than adequate characterization.The pacing isn't always at top speed, but they make all of this work pay off in the end. A solid four stars."
4,Loved this book!,This is the first book I've read by these authors and I absolutely loved it. Even the parts that were supposed to be slow seemed exciting. I'm definitely hooked and will continue to read the other books by Preston and Child. Can't wait to get started.
5,Mount Dragon review,Once again these two guys have written a great book. The book keeps your interest from page 1 and never lets you wander. I hate putting the book down at night to go to sleep and once again it appears that they have done a tremendous amount of research to keep the book interesting without having too much technical information that you begin to lose interest.
3,So-so story. They've done better,"This book was a tad dry for my taste. There was a little too much focus on chemistry for my taste so unfortunately, those parts of the book -- which were significant -- bored me. The book does have it good points -- some of the characters are interesting, and some of the scenes keep your attention, but in sum, it all adds up to an average read. These authors have done better."
3,mount dragon falls short,"the premise is interesting, the storyline appealling but it is told in a slow stilting manner that made finish reading the story a chore rather than entertaining."
2,Is there a third episode as claimed,I am hearing that the dvd set contains only 2 cds (angor vat and the great wall) and is missing the third on the 'temples of India' which I found most interesting. Is it true ??
2,Collapsing Lungs - 'Colorblind' (Atlantic),"Okay,as it turns out,this five-song CD isn't as bad as I expected.I mean I come across this EP,extended single,WHATEVER it actually is and took the time to listen to it.Collapsing Lungs seem to combine some rap with industrial-techno and metal.'Colorblind' is,as it turns out quite tolerable.Track listing is ""Crackerjack""(4:22),""Let's Play A Game""(2:57),""Bang!""(4:09),the anti-racism ""Too Blind To See""(5:01)and ""Down For The Count""(2:47).This EP appears to be the band's sole release.Oh,well."
3,Something new for me.,"I normally listen to a totally different genre ( I love my ska!) of music from what this is but, one night when I was getting my getting my hair cut by one of my friends she was listening to ""Suga Suga"" and I love it. I don't think this album is too bad over all but, the only reason that I am going to get it is for that one song."
1,#3 Song of the Year,Here is the awesome punch line it finnish #3 in the song of theYear sweepstakes by me of course thats worst songs of the yearLyrics 0/10 Production 0/10 Overall 0/10
5,"Powerful book, simply written, beautiful photos and art.","Inspiring book with beautiful photographs and art. A special help during rough times.... An easy read with a potent message! It is an effective book to read again and again as needed as: a reminder, an encouragement, a message of peace, hope and help. I have friends who have used it to help deal with trauma and as an encouragement and source of hope during serious illness including cancer treatments."
4,"Wonderful Artwork, Nice Book - a review of ""Pretend You're A Cat""","You can read the entire book at one sitting, or just one or two poems to get those toddler and preschooler creative juices flowing.This is a lovely book that is a lot of fun for small fry. The poems are very short and are good rhyming practice. Just pause and pretty soon your child will be filling in the blanks.The book also gets children thinking. What else does a cat, cow, horse... do? Can I do it too? Animals featured are: cat, dog, fish, bee, chick, bird, squirrel, pig, cow, horse, seal, snake, and bear.Four Stars. [B+]. The artwork by Jerry Pinkney is delicious and ties in wonderfully with the poems. Good read-aloud."
4,I warmed up to it.,"When this album first came out, I felt jilted. But I recently had an oppertunity to listen to it for what it is and I think its a great album. Make no mistake, if you're a die-hard 80's rocker, you'll hate this album. The production is raw, and the songwriting is lean and mean as opposed to elaberate and detailed. But that doesn't mean that the musicianship is lacking on this record. If you can keep an open mind, I think this ablum is one that you'll love."
4,Nuno's guitar work is very impressive,"This album beats out a more negative vibe than any of Extremes others, but that doesn't mean that its not enjoyable. The real attraction towards the sound of this album is in the guitar work of Nuno Bettencourt. The intricate rhythms of the guitar solos, made possible by Nuno's shredding abilities, are magic. In some ways I feel his sound bluesy, with an influence of Hendrix. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who it buying their first extreme album, a more rewarding buy would be the best of Extreme: an accidental collication of atoms. I would recommend it to someone looking to expand their Extreme collection however. Particularly impressive songs are Midnight Express, where Nuno shows off his incredible speed on a steel string acoustic, and Hip Today, the guitar solo of which still blows my mind. Also worth mentioning is cynical f***, which isn't as technically impressive but an enjoyable hard rocking song none the less."
2,The Worst of Extreme,"You'd think that after releasing 3 albums, these guys would have honed their craft. Sadly, this album is their worst release. Seems they tried to strip the sound back a bit on this album, fewer guitar overdubs being the obvious change. This album sounds a bit empty to me, I preferred the fuller sound of their earlier releases. The first 3 albums are great. Being a fan of Nuno Bettencourt, I'd also recommend the first Mourning Widows album (the second one is not quite as good)."
1,There is a reason it is no longer inprint in the U.S.,"Simply put, this album is terrible. After there first two albums, Extreme began to go downhill..and on this album they finally crashed and burned."
1,WARNING - DON'T BUY IT - IT'S BASICALLY DISCONTINUED!!!,"I was so pumped to get this, but when I got it home, it turns out that they have had some sort of a corporate breakup with the ONLY company that makes the software that runs it.So you receive the scratch amp and ""Traktor 2"" in the box, but you will soon find that it is NOT compatible with Intel Macs. SO guess what! You can't use it. Native Instruments won't help you either, you are out of luck.Stanton claims that they have made it ""Open Source"" and someone will soon step up with new software...it's been a few years now...NOTHING.You'll never get it to work. Stanton should be ashamed of themselves for basically tricking consumers in to buying up their dead backstock of this useless product.It's already dead on MAC. It will never be updated for WINDOWS. AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS."
2,Bad placement of drain,The drain is located on the side of basin not the bottom like it should be. This does not allow the soapy water to completely drain out. We had to tilt the basin to one side to get it to drain causing discomfort to the patient. Poor design. Plus for $65.00 you would think the drain hose would have been long enough. I had to go to the hardware store and buy a longer one.Very dissapointed overall.
5,Restless Spirit: The Life and Work of Dorothea Lange,Excellent book with great photos. Great for someone who would like to read a shorter version of this fascinating photographer's life!
2,red light district,"LUDA WHAT HAPPENED TO LUDA THIS IS ONE OF HIS WORST ALBUMS THIS CD ONLY GOT A FEW TRACKS THAT I LIKE ITS LIKE LUDA DON,T CARE NOMORE DON,T BUY THIS BUY ONE OF HIS OTHER GREAT ALBUMS"
4,"1,2,3 and so fourth","Now usually around the fourth album, us listeners begin to grow weary of rappers with no interest in expanding. Which brings us to Ludacris who presents the audience with The Red Light District. First of all let me say that the production on the album credits are far much better than that of his previous releases. The songs that really stand-out are: Number-one Spot; Get Back; Put your money; Blueberry and needless to say (all of the songs have that profounding production advantage). Now let's not get carried away here, Ludacris is not a 2pac, Nas or a Scarface, but he therefore brings lyrical improvisation and energy. If you look up the word ludicrous (you will find that the meaning for the word is ridiculous or outrageous) which is to say in this matter loud and boisterous. So overall, I believe this album deserves 4 stars (like this being his fourth album)"
2,No play in GA,"We in da red light district!!! apparently Luda likes to pay for hoez, thats not so hot and neither is this album. Ludacris is a pretty funny rapper and has a decent presence, but he needs the right beats to rap on otherwise his voices gets annoying. This album suffers from weak production but its not a bad as chicken and beer. For some real GA ish check out the new Pastor troy 'face off 2' and get some Camoflauge or some Baby D."
2,"Um, I'm glad I bought it used.","I bought it used off of Amazon for $8. That's about what it's worth. His lyrics are stupid! They only sound good, if at all, at the beginning of the song and then random people just repeat stuff over and over again. Get Back and The Potion are the only viable songs on this album. The rest of the songs he brags about how many houses he has, how big his PP is (which it probably isn't), and what kind of car he'll be showing up in... to one of his houses. I remember listening to Luda and hearing powerful, smooth rhymes."
1,Come on Luda,luda what is this.I love your other albums but this one is lacking some beats.youre the king of choruses but this cd is just bad you need to do cd's like your first one man.keep it upstand up Luda
2,Not repping the South,I use to be a Luda fan. But He has gotten to commercial and he lyrics are so pop tart. Any one can rhyme and make you funny lil punch lines. Or better yet just sing like you're a cartoon character but I guess once you sell 9 million records you can say what you want....I only brought this CD because it was 30 % off...How the hell a CD 30% off the 2nd week on the shelf. Luda always sounds better feat. On someone else's track maybe he should just do that for a living...I wont spend anymore money on him. If you want a real southern Rap album pick up T.I' s Urban Legend.
2,AFroman,Sink yo money into the new AFroman disks...He cares about his listeners and the music wontdisappoint...www.afromanmusic.com
2,Red Light District,"This was a very odd album, the majority of the songs (Number one spot and two miles an hour) but I really liked Get Back and The Potion but the #1 spot remix is sicksicksick!!! And also the red light district used to be the term for the part of town where prostatutes lived and well... you know..."
3,Luda Stinks,The major labels dont get it yet artist like this should be banned! There nowere near the quality of a Traum or Cormega yet they get all the light please help us. Labels like Masta Mix Records wouldnt even talk to these cats and the dirty south is running rap byt the cant rap thanks to the majors!!!!
1,Nothing to write home about.....,"""King David"" bends over for his/her/its unemployed daddy who just got word that he has Aids! King David's favorite activities are as follows:1) Bending over for his thug homies2) Collecting welfare3) Practicing ebonics4) Drinking cereal with water5) Using the computer in his ghetto hood library because he is too broke to own a computer6) Putting up naked pictures of Luda, Jada, and Feminem7) Kicking it with his imaginary homies aka the blow-up doll8) Creating fantasies within his warped mind"
4,mmhmm,"the reason i bought this CD is because the []D [] []V[] []D song blue berry yum yum reminds me to get on xbox live.the songs that i mainly like Are the potion,blue berry yum yum,number one spot,and a few others,If you are looking for somthing to listen to on the weekends this is ur album to buy."
3,pulls out,"Listening to a Luda cd is always an experience in itself. You always get something meaty, but there's always some differences, whether one album has more thrust, another longevity, or another disappointing prematurity. Luda's latest provides the inches of meat you're accustomed to, but ""pulls out"" too soon. Look, we all know Luda has a super long thang, but what we all wonder is, ""what is he going to do with it?"" In the instance of RLD, he basically puts it in for a second, then immediately takes it out and puts it to your face. Then? Nothing. He squirts about 1/100 of a baby and you're left thinking, ""damn you dried up."" In sum, Ludacris has a very long offering, which is still thin, of course, but he doesn't come through. He comes, yeah, but you can't even tell. Inches don't always equal dollars, Luda. Besides, you need to abuse yourself more, thicken that ish up."
1,the total package,"Ludacris has length, but not thickness. Still, length rules, right? Most people say, ""yeah, I'm 8 inches,"" or some other lie (or if you're Ludacris, you say that you're 16 inches when you're only 12), but no one says, ""Dog, I'm 7 inches wide!"" Anyway, I guess I'm just bitter, because I've never tasted Ludacris' succulent sweet-meat. I heard he'll jam up any throat though, and gets particularly forceful during intercourse if you chafe him with your stubble. Luda really makes you believe in a higher power, because after the death of Milton Berle we now have Luda to take his place."
2,Not quite as good as word of mouf but still alright!,"This album is okay, nothing great but nothing all that terrible!Luda dropped the soap in county and was violated over and over and over by some cat named pretty tony!"
1,Oh how I long for the days of curse-free rap,"Whatever happened to rap that was devoid of curse words??? I long for the late 70's and 80's rap that was truly rap performed by talented MC's with serious skills. It sickens me that ""rappers"" of today are getting rich off kids who are sucked in by the dirty topics and profane lyrics of the day. Whatever happened to needing actual talent to make a hit record? Will we ever again, someday in rap's future, see the mic skills to rival the greats of all-time...such as Run, KRS One, Chuck D, Rakim, Jalil Hutchins(of Whodini), Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaata, Eric Sermon(of EPMD), LL Cool J, Greg Brousszard(The Egyptian Lover), Joe Malloy(of Boogie Boys), and my personal favorite DMC??? It's sad that ""rap"" has deteriorated to the low point it has. Can someone please name a rapper today who has skills and doesn't use curse words or defame women in his music??? If so, please speak up so I can check him out. Thanks."
1,Wack,"Ludacris Is A wack Mc. He SuckS. Some of his songs will do ,but most are just lame. Child of the night is the only decent song! T.I. is the king of the south not ludacris."
3,NUMBER ONE SPOT REMIX,"I didn't believe the review that said there is a remix for Number One Spot with messed up lyrics, but then I decided to call a friend of mine who works at the Emerson College radio station. It turns out it's true! Not only does Luda say ""I'm coming in that number two spot"" but he moans when he says it! I was seriously about to puke when I heard it. Plus, instead of making all of those references to Austin Powers, he talks about Rock Hudson the whole time (my older sister, who's a Theater Major, clued me in to this). Then there's the voice at the end that says ""man is free to be a diva."" I can't believe that Ludacris is putting out garbage like this."
4,More good Luda,"Luda does it again with a powerful intro and sweet tracks like ""Number One Spot"", ""Spur of the Moment"" and ""Pimpin' All Over the World"". As with previous albums, the filler tracks don't do it for me, but there are a handful of hot beats to keep your head movin. Best surprise is Doug E. Fresh on Virgo, best head nod track on the album. If you like Luda, you need this in your changer."
4,Luda did it again ya'll!,This is one of Luda's best pieces of work. He really does a great job at letting his listeners in on his life. Listening to the Red Light District is like hearing a good book on tape. I am proud of Ludacris and I hope he proves the critics wrong again and again.
4,Losing ground with the competition.....,"Back For The First Time - 5 stars, Word of Mouf - 5 stars (actually 6 or 7), Chicken & Beer - 5 stars, Red Light District, for me personally was a let down. I understand it's hard to follow up on 3 great albums, but maybe a little more studio time would have helped. I don't understand the rush, it can't be money; Chris, slow down, and get the next one right. Case in point, Kenye West, he took his time and delivered one of the best albums of '04. RLD - productions were decent, lyrics were a snuff above par, but it just didn't have that, Ahh, you know, ""mojo"". I probably should have rated it lower, but knowing Chris' track record.... 4 stars ****"
1,apology,"Look, I was angry when I saw my idol turn against me, and so I lashed out. I mean, how would you feel if the person you looked up to most in this world suddenly singled you out as the most untalented, cum-for-brains hack this side of adolescence? I thought we were a team, man. I just want everyone to know that I may be hurt, but I won't let anyone (including Him) bring me down. To the Master, I'm sorry I latched on to your privates so forcefully, but it's rough being thirteen years old. You understand, right?"
2,the Ron Jeremy of rap,"Yeah, he the Ron Jeremy, but thinner. Thinner everywhere. But longer. Mane, I sucked that mutated dill pickle till my mouf was bruised. You know how you take that Ready Whip out tha fridge and fill ya grill wit white fluffiness? Well, I filled up off the TIP of tha real king of da south, but ain't nan fluffy. Stuff looked like Cetaphil, tasted like sardine juice, and sealed my damn throat like super glue. It was like them nasty Cadbury eggs you get at easter, wit that yolk ya dig? Luda too cold, and that ish too warm. I must be some sort of maskocist, too, caused I tossed that salad (wipe, mane!) Ain't no holdin tha dressin neither! What was that anyway, Chris, salty Ranch? I'm just playin, we still cool. Yo, represent our culture though, I know the world ready."
3,We in the red light district,"I hate the theme for the album. going to the hoes in the red light district. You think that will attract customers.I am a loyal fan anyway so I bought the album the day after it came out. the first single ""Get Back"" is crap. There are pointless lyrics. I like ""Number one Spot"", giving shoutouts to fictional Austin Powers characters. Another good one is ""Virgo"", which is also on the most recent Nas album, ""Street's Diciple"". There are songs that make a point like ""Large Amounts"", a funny story when Luda's family wants to take his money because he is rich. ""Pimpin All over the World"" is the third single. It is an average song but at the end, there is a hilarious skit with a guy shooting down dreams of pimps. On some songs, I just wasn't feeling the flow like in ""Hopeless"", and ""Pass out"".I reccomend the Red Light District to modern rap fans"
4,"Crunk, G Funk...It's All Here!","Probably Luda's best album. I love how there's something for everyone here. There's West Coast G-funk in two of the best songs, ""Child of the Night"" (A CLASSIC) with Nate Dogg and ""Spur of the Moment"" with DJ Quik on the beat. There's some crunk, which I don't like that much, and then there's your standard Ludacris party songs: ""Pimpin All over the World"" and ""Number One Spot"" are standouts here. All in all, a great album. Almost every song is good, which is definitely a rarity, in this day and age. And the variety...hard to come by in any genre by any artist."
5,luda drops 4th classic,"he 1 of tha best Luda,50,shady,pac,game,lil wayne are tha best luda hit us with tha best on all 4 cd's but this is classic"
4,PRETTY GOOD COMEBACK,"Ludacris did a pretty good job on this cd. Not the best, but good. Every song is really good. He hypes you up, then he takes it slow and then finishes strong with a collaboration with doug e. fresh and nas. This is a cool cd, so if you still don't own it, BUY IT."
4,Luda's back and still on fire,"FIrst of all let me say that I think Ludacris is a genius. From his lyrics to his flow to his videos, the man is just oozing with talent. He is a bright spot on today's rap scene. There are so many so-so artists that become successful and I just shake my head and wonder why. In Luda's case, it is well deserved. A great album, although not as good as ""Chicken N' Beer"" or ""Word of Mouf"", it just shows how consistant the man can be. If you like Ludacris' past albums you absolutely have to have this. If you are new to Lucacris, you absolutely have to have this. This is one of the few rap albums that you can listen to the lyrics, understand them, get a chuckle out of them and then do it all over again. Thank you Ludacris for breathing some life into the dead genre of hip-hop."
3,Not up to potential,"Ludacris is the best lyricist in the game who has never released a great record. There are two reasons why: 1. He cares too much about making club bangers. 2. He releases LPs to fast, one a year is too much. If he would take his time he could write something amazing, but he didn't on this record and I don't know if he ever will take his time. Red Light District has it's moments(like all of his previous LPs) and is perfect if you want to get hyped going to the club. If you want something deep and meaningful this is not the CD for you. If you want a completely solid effort from Luda you'll have to take the 3-5 tracks from each of his records and burn them on to one disc, because Luda may never accomplish this himself."
4,Listen,"These ""jokes"" about Luda's, er, privates were funny the first time, but now it's just gettin' really old and repetitive. If I were whoever's doing that, I'd stop if I were you, 'cos it just ain't funny anymore and it's really annoying if you're someone who actually wants to read some real reviews.This person has no life, like the person who reviews Chingy albums about 300 times each and gives them all 5 stars... That ain't even real hip-hop. Ludacris is considerably better than that and Red Light District is a good album - second best behind Word of Mouf.Highlights:Number One SpotGet BackChild of the NightSpur of the MomentPimpin' All Over the WorldHopelessVirgo"
1,How?,Luda iz fake just like thiz guy posting reviews with various names giving the cd 5 stars.You must be g*y because this cd is bad and everybody knowz it.Amazon should kick this guy out.U must be jealous of other artists that are making classicz.Luda can't pull it off.Get back should be called get out.Shame on you
1,T.I. is what's hot in ATL!!,"I'm sorry, but this album is very weak... I don't know where he was going with this album. The production was weak, and it seems like he's trying too hard... save ya money and go buy T.I. Luda's best was Word of Mouf, and he hasn't topped that yet, so go back to ya roots.."
2,didnt live up to the hype,Im a luda fan but this album was really boring...none of the tracks really came at me like damn i think i needa replay that...the beats are really dumb kind of like a 7th grader put em together..this album is really not worth buying..i bought thinkin it was going to be straight bumpin but was definately disappointed. The only thing is Luda does almost save his album with his good lyrics but that didnt even impress me. He needs to make tracks more like his old stuff needs to be more from the streets of the ATL not different songs of f***ing a girl cuz it gets boring.Lyrics - B-Beats - COverall- C-
2,too long!,"I been wit Luda. Dog, I got it in my back for the first time wit ma boy! I remember it like yesterday, fool, me an tha prince smokin purple together. He say, ""Boo, you ever been freaked in THAT way?"" I said no, but it might hurt. He took out that foot long meat (you'd pay ten bucks for that ish at Kroger, believe dat!) and I thought, ""damn, he gon rip me another one of dem junts."" Luda lubed up, an I got excited, starting to pre-cum, but made myself hold on. Now, I'm packin'-- 8 inches mane! But Luda, he just made me feel like a lil un, like I was bein raped by a demon. He toe me up! Damn, that sum long meat. Too long, an dats why dis mark get 1 star--fo flodgin like he gon take care of me an mine and leavin my hairy sef in tha cold. You too raw. Luda! It gon come back ta bite yo rump, trick! He say, ""go ta sleep, ho,"" but I'm a get right. My money comin, believe dat! Yeah, I'm a mane, what?"
1,Keeping it real,"Hey kids, please take your cues from ""Get Back"". The sooner you mess up, the sooner we get you off the street. Five young black boys broke my jaw last year. I got permanent damage and 20K worth of medical bills. They got $60 and three years of bending over in jail. Just go on ""keeping it real"" for the fans, Ludacris. You're doing a great job."
5,Luda Did it again,"This CD is fire!! I'm listening to a burned borrowed copy because I'm in Iraq and it's not out here yet but as soon as I see a PX with this cd I'm buying it. Everything Luda spits on is a hit and this cd is no different. My favorite track is ""Large Amounts"". Buy this cd."
2,Crap! CRap! CRAp! CRAP!,"Take my advice and buy something worth buying. This is Luda's worst CD to date and I have them all. I'm not one of those people that hear their favorite artist put out a record and expect them to keep doing the same formula over & over again. I admire artist that have the cajones` to expand themselves musically. This CD though, it seems as if these were left over from the less impressive Chicken & Beer album. I can't front, their are a couple of songs that are worth (i.e. 1 Spot, 2 Miles an Hour) listening too. For your fans sake though Luda, take it back to Word of Mouf days cause you have just lost a fan AND a consumer."
1,For wiggers and trl fans...,"Ha... When you think it can't get any worse besides gay unit , faglouz, chingy ,ja-rule, feminem? What we get? Ludacris's ""red light district"" what a piece of sh*t album diz realy is! Aint no track realy worth mention coz dey all crap. Rap or hip-hop whatever you call diz? Is terrible now. Listing to some wutang,big,rass kass,xzibit, or, Nas."
5,Luda's BEST WORK,"You can even let it play out...that's an accomplishment! ""Two Miles An Hour"" so everybody sees you...if you have a ride, YOU NEED THIS!! If you take a bus, YOU STILL NEED THIS!! ;-P"
3,It's decent,"I mean...DON'T HATE, it's my opinion mo fo's, i feel like the best album he has is chicken & beer, but i am feelin some joints up here like the intro, #1 spot, blueberry yum yum, child of the night, the potion, pimpin' all over the world with bobby v., virgo, large amounts, put your money, it's a decent effort. so buy it if u want to..."
3,The Laid Back Album for 2005,"Ludacris' latest album Red Light District is consider in my opinion a slept-on album. Luda had some hot tracks like ""Blueberry Yum Yum"",""Spur of the Moment"" and ""Virgo."" I believe that if he would had taken more, it could have been better."
4,Luda has done it again !,"Ludacris has always done a good job with all his albums.Someting to hear in this album is #1 Spot,Get back,Put your money with DMXChild of the night with nate dogg and the rest is very good.The track that gives a important fact is hopeless featuring Trick Daddy.Holla at the A and for Luda!"
3,Luda has gone too far with new remix,"I could've sworn that King David was up to something again, but then I talked to some partners of mine up in New York who heard the Number One Spot Remix and said it's for real. They said that Ludacris had the song put on side B of the single as a joke. ""I'm coming in his number two spot""? That's not funny, it's just gross. I don't see how a rapper can talk about doing things with men for a whole song and then say he's just kidding. Maybe he thought no one would get the Rock Hudson references or that no one knows who Ru Paul is anymore. Anyway, there was supposedly only 500 copies pressed for that version of the single, so maybe the controversy will die away. Personally, I can't listen to his music anymore after hearing that."
4,"Ludacris really ""Disturbin Tha Peace""","Damn! The new album ""Redlight District"" by Ludacris is one of his best albums. On this album the hits ""Get Back"" and ""Number 1 Spot"" with more. The album has the likes of DMX and Sleepy Brown and many more. Ludacris went all out on this album. You should get it if you don't mind the cursing. The album has the hits and ""Put Your Money"", ""Potion"", and ""Spur of the Moment"". These songs should be the next hit before his next album. This album is really for anyone who is alright with Ludacris bad mouth. Also if you're a teen who parents who don't like bad mouths use headphones. Remember that his next album drops this spring so go get it because it might be for "" minimes, models, and fat bastards"""
4,HOT ALBUM!!!!!,"The Red Light District from Ludacris is the greatest album that he's ever released. Word of Mouf and Chicken and Beer were hot, but this is his greatest!!! Every song is hot. Includes appearances and/or production by Nas, DMX, Nate Dogg, Lil' Jon, Timbaland (Just 2 name a few). This album will NOT disappoint, though he could have had appearances by Usher and the DTP crew."
5,Dude what tha hell,"What I mean is this king david or whever dreaming about there ""encounters"" with Luda. They or it probly woke up from a wet dream or some crap wishin they did it wit Luda. Just stop its retarted. Anyway the cd was one of Luda's best. No ho's in differnt area codes,but also sadly no other DTP like Shannaw or Lil Fate. This cd is worth buyin though.Wit Get back #1 spot and Who not me, this is a must buy"
2,Unconfident and weak.,"Ludacris is a bonafide superstar. He has had a fair amount of bump-able radio tracks that still hold up as the years go by. Unfortunately, the Red Light district didn't meet my expectations, and seemed well.....corny. Track 2's homage to Austin Powers is way lame. Maybe 3 years ago, when an Austin Powers movie was in the theatre's, it would have been cool on a soundtrack. It's the end of 2004, and makes no sense. The rest of the album is Luda singing about ""being #1."" Get in line man, all MC's think they are #1. Find something else to spit. Having to remind us that you are #1 in every track makes Luda has a lack of confidence."
5,HOT CD WITH GREAT HOOKS,"LUDACRIS DID IT AGAIN, IT DELIVERS A GREAT VIBE FROM SONG TO SONGWITH SOME GREAT COLLABORATIONS WITH BOTH KNOWN AND UNKNOWN ARTISTS. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS CD."
5,"Smart raps, sick beats","This is, without a doubt, one of Ludacris' best albums (if not the best). Packing flavor, heat, flawless rapping and pounding beats, The Red Light District is addictive. No two songs sound the same; each expresses a unique and hip side of Ludacris. If this album isn't already one of your favorites, it will be. The Red Light District is soon bound to become a classic."
2,Don't buy it!,"man this album is really not good. i like ludacris, his a good rapper but i'm not really felling this one, there's only four good songs in here, and that's not good enough for a good rap album. i don't even know why everone likes ""get back"" that song is rubbish. but the song hopeless is great, classic song with great lyrics and a great beat, trick is really good here and Luda's lyrics are on fire. I Also like ""Put your money"" with X, it would have been even better if X did a verse here but it's still a great song. Child of the Night is good too, again Luda again drops nice, deep lyrics and nate comes good on the chorus. The other good song is ""who not me"", this song has a nice beat and crazy lyrics. but the rest of the tracks are bull****, and why is ""Virgo"" in this album, it's already in Nas's ""Street's desciple"". Anyway, i'd recomend you to buy this only if u r a die hard Luda fan, if u'r not then i'd suggest u listen to it first.OUTLAW"
4,Tha True King Of The South,"My boy Luda put out yet anotha fresh album. His style is different from any otha rapperz. Good production and Ludacris spittin some hot fire make this a good ass album. My favorite trackz are the Intro, Number One Spot, Get Back, The Potion, Who Not Me, Large Amounts, Pass Out, Blueberry Yum Yum, Spur Of The Moment, Two Miles An Hour, and Virgo. Ludacris is tha King of the South, not T.I. No disrespect to T.I. but he has a little while to go before he can say he is the King of the South."
1,"Okay, but not Word Of Mouf Pt. 2","This CD was a very disappointment to me. I thought tha Luda wouldstop being lazy after bummy ""Chicken & Beer"". When I heard thathe was going to come out with another CD I was happy. When I heard it, I felt like putting it in the trash. If you are a rapfan and want to get a Ludacris LP, I suggest you get ""Word of Mouf"". Because this isn't the real Ludacris."
4,Tight,"Now i've heard mixed reviews on this album but i believe its his best since Back for the First Tim, Word Of Mouf was ok but not great, Chicken and Beer was a total dissapointment i thought luda had fell off with it but Red Light District puts him back in my favorite rappers list, the best song on the album in my opinion is ""Child of the Night"" with Nate Dogg luda's back with this one pick it up."
3,Virgo,"Ludacris has a song called ""Virgo,"" which is the sign of the fish, and that is exactly what he tastes like. My theory is that because the sperm have so far to go (12 inches is a long swim for such little guys), they die off and make the semen rotten, so by the time that warm offering reaches your mouth, it has that rancid, fishy taste. My advice to you other boys: convince him to take it to your face. The only reason this cd gets 3 stars is due to the fact that Luda can be quite comfortable to fellate if you do it right. He's thin enough so that if you only take in a couple of inches, it's like sucking on a vienna sausage."
3,good rymes bad songs,"the rymes are unbelievable. good cd but will get old. bad beats except in the first 2 songs. ludacris did a good job with this cd and its writing but the producer didntgood songs:intro, number 1 spot, 2 miles an hourbad songs: the rest"
1,Bad,Luda this cd is too bad. Chicken n Beer was alright but this is nothing. I think you should think about what you are doing cause you did great hits and now you do bad cd's.
2,"Strong start, weak finish","I've been a fan of luda since phat rabbit on tim's bio. His first: Back for tha First Time was great second: Word of Mouth was good third: Chicken & Beer was ok and now Red Light District.........(yep) dissapointing. The cd starts great like the previous one's but its like whats hell is going on as u are going on through the cd. If you are a fan of his and just have 2 have R.L.D with ur collection go ahead buy it, but Its not worth 14.99, 11.99, not even 9.99 im just given u fans a heads up. SAVE YO MONEY!!!!"
1,Oh No,I dunno what album everyone else was listening to but this does not cut it. Ludacris The Red Light Disrtict is surrounded by hype just like most of these so called artists today. I am so sick of the South and there medicore rappers/singers talking about nonsense. I cant wait until the day Southern Hip Hop fade away because it's TRASH
1,its all true,I thought y'all wuz flodgin but he really do say he cumin in number 2 spots.(a man ass that is) I got tha mp3 last night of tha remix and its nasty. Luda career gon go down tha drain talkin bout mens parts like that. Luda you dead wrong.
1,fake fake fake,"Man, I told Chris, ""I'm a call you Sputnik, cause you make me feel like I'm in outer space."" He was cool, but then I never heard from his rich ass. That's cold, especially when you RICH. Dude left a wooden nickel on the g-damn dresser. Well, hold up, I got a confession right chere for that lame: I ain't what you thought. You seen Ace Ventura? You know what a fruit basket is? Yeah, it was tucked all the way back baby. And while I'm strokin that disgusting thing, hollerin ""oh, baby,"" you with a man, playa! Yeah, you long, but you know you thin! I could give a what about Luda, tha redhoe."
5,Mellow crystal clear Jazz Female Vocals,"I bought one of Tierney's CD's and was knocked over by her great voice and many venues she can play and sing.Tonight is her night, I have almost all of her albums and am relaxing listening to a Jazz Artist of the now.She is incredible.... I doubt there are few Jazz songs she could not do with ease and then put her own special touch on it"
4,"Very nice, but not perfect","Well-designed, nicely finished, strong materials. Yet, the metal spatula is not tightly bound in the handle. The narrow gap is enough for the spatula to wobble a little in the handle. Probably not enough to effect function, but enough to provide a space for material to accumulate over time. Still, a quality piece at a good price."
3,"""Interpretations"" has little ""New"" Material","Interpretations, released on the Carpenters 25th anniversary is somewhat of a disappointment to me, as it only has three ""new"" previously unreleased recordings, these being: ""When I Fall In Love"", ""From This Moment On"", and Tryin' To Get The Feeling Again"". The rest of the songs on the album are remastered/remixed versions of previous Carpenter hits.Is it worth the asking price for three additional songs? Each buyer will have to decide that for himself/herself. The fact that these songs were never included on previous albums says something about their quality as perceived by Richard and Karen Carpenter.As big a fan as I am of the Carpenters, my reluctant advice is to skip this album.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig"
3,so so,"cool hat, cinches snug around the head and works for walking. If it's windy, don't wear it, because there is no chin strap/string to keep it on. I am going to buy a hat with a chin strap so I can ride my bike and walk the mountain when it's windy."
4,4 Panel Large Bill Flap Hat,"Light weight. ""One size fits most"", but a little tight on me (average size head). The built in elastic strap conforms to my head, but is uncomfortably tight. The bill provides adequate sun protection. The flaps could be carried further forward since they barely cover my ears. The bill is quite stiff, but that is not a problem since it holds its shape well."
3,good,"la uso luy seguido y espero seguir haciendo la entrega fue rapida y oportuna, un buen producto muy util y comodo"
4,Flap hat,"Looks great. Hope my husband likes it. Lots of shade for my pool man. Not sure about my son, though."
2,Flats Fisherman Reject,Florida flats fisherman rejected this large billed flap hat because it was just that--too wide brimmed and without tie-downs for flaps. Moving in a boat at high speed renders this hat useless. Probably excellent for birdwatchers.
4,Good Sun Protection,"My husband has had skin cancer so we wanted to get something to protect him from the sun. When he saw this hat he thought it would be ""hot as hell"". It actually isn't too bad. It does a good job of shading his face and the flap hangs down low enough to cover his neck even when he's only wearing a t-shirt. We both thought he would look a little silly in it, but it looks pretty good."
4,Summer Sun Hat,"This hat is fairly well constructed; I like how well it blocks the sunlight. I do not like the little rope tassel with bulky metal clip that is used to hold the ""tail"" part in place. That is a minor complaint though. Other than that, for the price, this is a decent hat. The other ones in comparison might be a little better quality, so there is a trade-off for the price difference.Good hat to block sun!"
5,Great for Long hikes,"I just order this hat the other day and went on a 6 hour 3,000 feet elevation round trip hike.I knew I was going to sweat and wear a bandana under the hat. At the end of the trail my head was cool and my neck was not burn. Now, as for my friend that did not have a hat, his neck was toast and he just looks burnt.The hat made it bearable over the long trail. I was pleasedGuess what my friend is ordering how? That is right, this hat.Happy Trail"
4,Just a little hot,I bought this hat to keep the sun off of me while roofing. It does help to keep the sun off and I am no longer getting burnt up on a daily basis. However I am very surprised at how hot this hat is to wear. It has venting but for me it does not seam to help. Other than this it has been a good buy and value.
4,It's a Dorky-Lookin' Hat,"All polyester hat. Seemingly good construction; well-made (in China). Does the job. (As advertised.) ** But there's no getting around the fact that, yeah, it's pretty dorky-lookin'. This hat probably will never set any fashion trends. [Personally, I don't mind looking a little ""odd"" now & again.] ** But, yeah, the hat is what they say it is, and it does the job they say it does. ** If you're looking for function-over-form: Then this hat is for you."
2,Cheep,"You get what you pay for. If quality doesn't matter to you, or you don't care if this hat blows away, then it's serviceable and probably right up your alley. If you don't want to pay any more for a sun hat for one season, then this will do. If you haven't seen some of the ones costing about $10 more, you'll probably find this acceptable. It's considerably heavier than the Sunday Afternoon hat which is polyester, nor can you reshape the visor which is where most of the weight is. One size fits most which is usually men's hat sizing. My opinion? It's just ok."
5,This is a great hat,"Even on a hot day, the hat feels cool on your head and the long flap in back is not hot on your neck and keeps the sun off. It is a bit Lawrence of Arabia, but I kind of like that aspect of it too."
5,My dad loves it!,I got this for my dad for fathers day and he is thrilled! He especially wants to cover his ears from the sun. He says he feels like he is going on a safari! I am so glad that such an inexpensive item can make him happy.
5,Great protection from sun,"Great protection from the sun for your ears and neck. Sturdy,well built hat at a great price from Amazon. Happy customer!"
4,father and son,A father discover he has a tumor at the stem of his brain : His son is sharing his anxiety et helps him to take a medical decision
3,"Personal, But Too Personal?","It assumes a certain degree of risk for one of the most successful writers of the last half of the 20th Century to expose his personal life for the approval of the public. Perhaps crossing a barrier into intimacy in ""Patrimony"", Philip Roth tells of the story of the death of his father.It is difficult to be judgmental about biographical account of of somebody's life or in this case death while not being overly critcal of the person. Yet while I found this book to be humorous at points, the story was just not what I had hoped to read. I am a fan of many of Philip Roth's other books. I knew this book would be unlike his other books and risked alienating Roth's fan base. This makes me wonder why Roth ever wrote or published this book.While it is personal and exhibits good storytelling, it never engaged me as a reader. To be cliche, I never felt Roth's pain. In this regard, this book is somewhat of a lemon."
5,A MUST for interfaith couples!,"I'm Hindu and my fiancee is Jewish. This was the most comprehensive and helpful tool in creating our wedding ceremony. Not only that, we benefited from the author's advice as to how to work with sometimes sticky family issues. My fiancee loved all the interfaith love stories. She actually shed a few tears! We recommend this book as a must for all interfaith couples. It is embracing, uplifting, accessible, encouraging and down-to-earth in tone. The book features over a dozen religions and dozens of cultures, so it seems to me a much needed book in today's day and age."
4,All too RARE! This one IS a Journey to Spirit!,"Isn't that what you were looking for? Bright Spirits? Beautiful scenery? Fresh Air? Isn't that why we watch movies in the first place? This movie is truly a blessing, not lending itself to the latest fashion fad in music or dress, it stayed true to the sacredness of life, and that sacredness triumphed all the way through, as it does in real life when we keep that sacredness in tact, without over worrying or fearing. It left me with a good feeling to see people concentrating on the important things for once in a movie without a care, and not the usual teenage ""Oh I want to lose my virginity and drunk junk."" This one has culture and sacredness in tact, and yes it's an ADVENTURE! Not to mention fun! Especially when you consider that when you learn to listen, Miracles DO happen, and happen WELL."
3,California Diaries #4 Scores a Three!,"The reason I rated this book a three, was because it was a good book. It explains some of the things that happen in real life. The book was also sad. I felt bad for what Amalia had to go through. I thought it was boring because it didn't have a lot of suspense. It also had to do with relationships gone bad. The women at the GEAE had been beaten, and Amalia had been in a bad relationship herself. I would recomend this book to 6th, 7th and 8th graders who like to read about romance. Most of the book is about Amalia's relationship with James. Also, a lot of the things Amalia goes through, people have to go through all the time."
3,It was okay,"Before, it was no big deal. James wanted to do things his way, and sometimes Amalia leta him. but now he won't give up. Amalia thinks james doesn't know her anymore. And Amalia is sure that jam,es doesn't know Amalia."
4,Amalia is cool,"This was the fourth CALIFORNIA DIARIES book I read. I read them all in order. I've read the BSC books for a couple years now,a nd a lot of it is unrealistic. These books are real, and they deal with real problems. I find them very interesting, it's so cool that they are written in diary-form. Amalia was a great book! She is so cool. I love that she's in a band."
5,exellence.pure exellence.,"I love this book. I thought it was great because the plot is wonderful and very realistic.I really enjoyed all the drawings in it, and the way Amalia discribes ""big tooth lover boy"". It helped me realize what can happen it you get yourself mixed up with the wrong kind of person. BRILLIANT."
4,Exciting and well-written,"This is a great book! It kept me on my toes the whole time. I loved all the books in this series, but this is my favorite!!"
5,VERY GOOD BOOK!!!!!!,This is the best of the series I have read I think. I also like Maggie's second diary. But this was definately a top 3!
2,Eh.....,"Since you have probably read about 20 plot summarys, im going to get straight to the point. This series is alot, if not completely, different from the Baby-Sitters Club series. Im not saying this is a bad thing, but im not saying it's a good thing. Ann M.'s writing style is way diffrent, and so are the charectors. They have bigger and a little more important problems from those of Kristy, Claudia, Mallory, Stacey, Jessise, etc. Finishing this book only minutes ago, I have to say it was quite chessy at times. I felt a little embaressed for the author who was obviously trying to make the charector sound ""cool"". I thought Amalia's drawings were a little, well, stupid, and the dialouge kind of corny. I thought it was rather boring sometimes, and struggled to finish it. I have read three others in this series, and thats enough for now.MAYBE I will read another one in time, but not for awhile...."
2,James was a cool dude - Amalia couldn't take it,"Hi, everyone here seems to write that james was a flat-out loser, but none of you realise that AMALIA was the villain (not the victim) in this book.James didnt hit Amalia so he cannot be classified as abusive. He came close, sure, but didn't touch her (except when they were kissing, heh heh heh). Amalia was lucky to get one kiss out of James cos James is so much cooler than she will eva be. Amalia didnt deserve James. One thing i didn't get about this book was that James wanted to KEEP amalia as his girlfreind. Why would he, he can DO BETTER. James should have hit her anyway to snap her back to reality: Amalia the underdog, James the king. All Hail James!California Diarys #4 is a good book. James is a hottie and if he lived in my suburb I would surefire go out with him for one steamy night!!!!!"
4,Great,"Amalia's first diary was good, and I liked it a lot. But it is implied by the reviewers and the summary that Amalia's boyfriend James is abusive. He isn't. James might be emotionally abusive, but he has never hit or touched Amalia. Other than that, the book rocked!!"
1,Expected Better from Donegan,"This seemed like an afterthought without putting much thought into the product. Not built very well .. The light flickers, very limited spread of light, the battery pack flops around and seems like it should be brighter. I looked for an alternative and found the Quasar Lighting System which fits over the lens and contains 6 very bright LED's. Honestly, this is the product that Donegan should have come up with. Same price as the OptiLIGHT, but unfortunately Amazon does not carry it. Very Very pleased with the Quasar. DO NOT waste your money on the OptiLIGHT."
2,Ok in a pinch,"Good for temporary light in dark work areas, not a permanentsolution. A bit overpriced for what you get, runs extremelyhot. Batteries die off quickly."
3,"Almost a necessity with the OptiVisor, but could be better designed...",I bought an OptiVisor and am very glad I bought one of these lights. I don't know how I would be able to see what I am working on without one of these lights. My main complaint is that the battery back does not snap tightly onto the headband and it constantly slides around. The clips for the cord don't stay in place either.
4,"Nice Swing, Nice Music","This swing works well. It does not really fold up small and easy to store, but it is an excellent swing."
3,"My swing broke, too","We used this swing a lot when my son was first born and it was a great swing, but broke by the time he was 6 months old. The company said that the version of the swing I had was discontinued and would only give me a refund of about half what the swing cost."
3,Boppy Travel Swing,"It's okay; wish I had known it's limitations before we bought it. When it arrived, some of the cords were disconnected and my husband had to sauder them together to make the swing work! We would have returned it, but that would have been a bigger hassle. However, my son (2/5 months) does really enjoy the swing. It's small so it doesn't take up a lot of room, but isnt' as easy to move around as I had thought. Overall, it's okay, but wish I had just bought one from a store (these just aren't available around us)."
5,great choice,"Batteries last forever in this swing, it folds up, swings strongly, and is comfy for the baby!"
4,Great and sturdy,Purchased the boppy swing as a gift for my neice. It is very sturdy and nicer then it looks in the picture. Recieved the item within days!Boppy Rock In Comfort Travel Swing
1,if your baby likes freedom - this is not the swing for you.,"Our 2 month old, 12 pound son hates to be confined. He hated this swing. The main problem was that he sunk into the seat - it looked so uncomfortable!!! He couldn't move his arms or legs and he cried when we put him in it. But if you have a baby that likes to be swaddled and kept confined - this may be the swing for you."
3,Easy baby cries in this swing,"Our baby rarely cries, EXCEPT when we place him in this swing. We tried it when he was 2 weeks old, and he still hates it now at 7 weeks. I thought it looked super-comfy, but he doesn't seem to care for it at all. It isn't bad looking and it's easy to move - too bad our son hates using it."
1,Spend more on the Papasan swing,We got this swing because the reviews seemed decent and we don't have a lot of space in our apartment so this swing looked like a good solution. Our kid HATED it. I've tried to resell it for $25 and can't find a buyer. It's terrible.
3,Bobby Siwng,After I assembled the swing I realized that it didn't work. My recommendation is to put batteries in it and make sure it works before you assemble it. I called the manufacturer and they send me a new arm. It took another week and a half to get the arm but it finally works.It's nice and my baby likes it. Good swing for the money.
1,motor failed for me too,"As I sit here manually rocking her in this swing, I'm very disappointed. It was great at first, and the only place my newborn would take naps, but after only 4 weeks it has stopped working (even with brand new batteries)."
5,My daughter loves it!!!!,"For my first daughter I didn't have a swing. After seeing how it helped my sister with her son I had to get one for my 7 month baby girl. At first she didn't like it because she wasn't used to it but now its wonderfull. I place her in her swing with a baby einstein video and she will stay there for hours with no complaint.My made loves it because she's able to keep cleaning the house while the baby relaxes in the kitchen, bedroom or wherever she's working at the time.I havent taken it on trips yet but it folds very easily so I'm sure if I wanted to I could.The little animals are beautifull and the music is quite relaxing and doesn't anoy the people arround the swing.I woul'd definetly recommend this product. I live in Ecuador and paid double its price to have it shipped here, so you can tell I'm realy happy with it.I've already changed the batteries once, but I use the swing almost in a daily basis for at least twice a day."
2,Not for larger babies,"My son was 8.6 lbs at birth and loved the swing, he fit really comfortable in it since we used a body pillow insert. The swing takes up little room and has really soft material. The six speed option is great. And that it turns off on it's own.However, that didn't last long. The price is way too much for the month of use we got out of the swing. He grew out of it so fast. He couldn't have been more than ten pounds when this happened. The seat is very uncomfortable for him already. I wouldn't recommend this to someone with a larger baby because they won't be able to use it for a long period of time."
4,"Various live and studio Fats, 1960 - ?","It's very hard for a Fats fan to keep up with all the live albums, mixed live albums, mixed studio albums/CDs/MP3s.Let's finalize the Domino deal by saying tere's not a bad track here (well, that's no big deal, Fats, in this Reviewer-Fan's opinion has never issued a bad track) and there's even some rarities, one from 1968, HONEST PAPAS LOVE THEIR MAMAS BETTER (Reprise); another from June of 1965 in Nevada, DANCE WITH MR. DOMINO (aka THE DOMINO TWIST) (Mercury), about two years too late for said craze but it all comes roaring back with this classic dance number, one of the very best of the genre, with stellar sax work and of course, familiar and funky keyboard by the Man.More intersting are (now) heavily recycled ABC-Paramount cuts like JUST A LONELY MAN and MARY, OH MARY, regional U.S.A. hits in 1963 and 1964, both sounding superlative on stereo headphones. Someone kicked up the bass and it's fabulous."
5,Attractive and sturdy,Attractive and very sturdy. Easy to install. Ended up buying a second set (towel bar and TP holder) to replace new item in another bath room. Excellent product.
4,Price versus features,"At the under $600.00 range, this is an unbeatable 21 ppm network printer. Contrary to the previous review the manual does tell you how to setup networking on the printer via the control panel. It also explains how to setup clients to print to it. My problem with the manual is that it isn't clearly layed out and the instructions I refer to are located in three sperate sections many pages apart. It's a long read at 233 pages too. Other than that, this is an amazing product for the price. I had mine up and running in about five minutes. Kudos to Samsung for good engineering, but the need to work out a ""quick install"" guide."
2,NOT for graphics!,"I bought this laser because it had good reviews. I wanted to use it to ""proof"" black and white photos before sending them to the printing press. All images output from the ML-2151N have horizontal banding (faint lines) across them. I called Samsung tech-support and was told ""that's just the way the printer is"" ""you'll have to take it back"" when I asked what printer would work for me he recommended a color laser. Text is fast and great. Also use the double sided printing."
2,"Good ""Movie"" - Bad DVD","If you are looking for a good ""movie"" such as this, it will barely hold your interest between skin shots. The girls are very hot, and worth putting up with the agonizingly poor ""plot"". However, the viewer wanting good DVD quality will be dissapointed. The digital encoding is lousy, and the sound is horrible. Then again, you wouldn't really think you'd be getting too great from a flick like this. Wait until the price drops so you won't be too dissapointed."
3,"Rebecca is hot, the rest is not!","This flick is too expensive for what you get, and in softcore flicks you need variety! While there is variety in this flick the only reason to buy it is for the main star on the DVD cover, she has about 2 awesome scenes. The rest of the chics in the movie are just fillers while they are hot, the scenes are not. The DVD quality is very low as well you have to manually go to each scene by fast forwarding the DVD! Overall the main chic is probably the hottest softcore porn chic you will come across, but all the action is man-woman, a minus. I would recommend Femalien in stead, peace..."
4,A Joy,"If you love books and enjoy reading about their history, manufacture and circulation, this volume is a must, easy to read and delightfully informative. How interesting to learn that, in the intensely competitive and examination-oriented world of China, scholars and book collectors were reluctant to give access to their treasures."
5,Excellent reading!,Along with the others I could not stop reading this and strangely like the others I didnt want it to end. This book is filled with knowledge of the other side and humor-the boy is very funny. So interesting to read he was truly wise beyond his years. I only wish there was another book to this or more recorded diaries. What a gift this child had.
5,my favourite psychic book to reread of all time,"Any bothers of the sometimes rather belief stretching terms such as fairies and lords of karma etc the child uses in this diary do not mar this stunningly wonderful read. This child has wonderful clairvoyant powers and writes this innocent diary about his childhood in Victorian England, a world of restrictions and religious rules. It is very amusing and I love to reread this more than any other modern book or psychic.It is superb because it is so fresh, it doesn't try to convince the sceptic, it just tells his daily life for us to read. A peep into another world. You take from it what you can take on board. Why can't we know who this child was? The publishers must know,and the minimal copyright initials add to the mystery."
2,Mildly Entertaining,"This book cannot be seriously evaluated as one is given almost no information about its source or background. One suspects that it is either a work of fiction (by whoever), or that the editor has an agenda. It can be read at one sitting. The first half is somewhat entertaining, but the second half is downright boring. To describe this book as important, I'm afraid one would require checkable source material. And I'm making this point as a person who is very open to the possibilities raised in the book. As it stands, one would need to be a very unquestioning person to take it seriously. Therefore it cannot be recommended as anything other than light entertainment."
4,Authentic,"I very much enjoyed this book and have recommended it to several friends who will appreciate it. It is written by a child, as his diary in England, in the Victorian era. In it he describes his gradual understanding that not everybody ""sees"" what he is able to see. There is something refreshing in the feeling of authenticity he brings in his writing. He is not trying to ""sell"" a point of view or convince anyone of anything. He knows what he sees and can say it in this, his private diary. Towards the end, it gets a bit bogged down. And the last section contains some letters he wrote as an adult and these are less engaging to read. The end had no ""ultimate conclusion"" that rounded it out as a satisfying read usually does. It is the crisp, childlike honesty of the first half or three-quarters of the book that really makes it something so alive and fun to read."
4,Afterlife,"I was intrigued that this diary was penned by a child in 1885. Children then spoke and acted differently than the I-pod, TV generation of today so you must allow yourself to remember that when reading the strange language. I am still not sure if I believe a child wrote it - and lived it. I had experiences myself when I was under 10 so I know that children are better receivers than adults, but some of the thoughts are mystifying and keep you awake at night wondering. I would advise reading this with a ""very open mind"" - and just allow yourself to digest it over a period of time."
2,Overkill for WA-2608 Rotating Antenna,"This is a heavy duty mount for heavy duty whatever. I purchased an all plastic, very lite HDTV outside Antenna. An not using the Antenna Mount with this product as it's way overkill."
3,Short Mast,One thing to note is that the tubing above the bend is short and will not work for all antennas depending on how they attach. I had to send mine back. I built my own using gas pipes and fittings that you can get at a hardware store.
4,"Sturdy, Easy to Use Antenna Mount","I liked this mount in that it could be mounted on an antenna mast using included U-Bolts or directly to the house siding/trim. For a small antenna, it's ideal. Extremely solidly built and easy to adjusted to the needed angle. I was pleasantly surprised at it's strength and quality of manufacturing, compared to most home antenna mounts which have been pretty junky."
5,"Very sturdy, priced right.","You are getting a lot of mount for your money. This is not some cheap muffler pipe, but a very nice mount.The finish is not that thick. I ordered four of these and all came with the mount in the down position. In order to have the mount perpendicular to the wall when attached I had to undo the adjustment bolts and swing the arm from the down to the up position. Were the bolts had been tightened the paint was worn off, indicating the thickness of the finish is not that dense. This may or may not concern you.They have a warning stick in place, advising you to avoid overhead electrical wires. Given the length of these mounts it is a little overkill. The bright red and yellow warning labels cannot easily be removed.Given the low price I am very happy with these mounts."
3,Heavy duty very basic,This is what's available for putting an antenna on your house to get off air TV and to dump cable. This product and the antennas could use refinement. Its heavy duty but crude.
3,Its a mount?,What else can I say. Its works and was relatively easy to secure to my home. Go antenna mount! Its the greatest :)
5,Excellent antenna mount,"This very inexpensive and easy-to-use antenna mount was purchased along with, and to to mountto, a Winegard MS1000 onto our DirecTV satellite pole. (We wanted to save money and do away with our Satellite bill.) It worked just fine, and was easy to use, as well as keeping it very strongly secured. I highly recommend it."
5,Did the job,Not much to say about an item like this. It was as described. Came with the hardware needed and was easy to install.
5,Great Mount!,Very well constructed and very solid. Will have no problems holding up an antenna on the eve's or on a wall.
2,disappointing,"I bought this keyboard because I needed to find an ergonomic solution for using a laptop, and wanted a keyboard with a trackpad (hard to find). Though I liked the look of this keyboard, I found it to be clunky, travel on keys was too much, made too much noise.I returned it and bought the iOne Scorpius wireless keyboard with trackpad - it is about the same price and a much better product."
3,"An incredible band, but a mediocre compilation","The excellent songwriting team of Difford & Tilbrook has long been one of the most underrated in rock and roll's history. From the immortal ""East Side Story"" to the more recent masterpiece ""Ridiculous"", Squeeze's albums have always been top of the line. The same cannot be said for their compilation albums, however. Although ""Piccadilly Collection"" does include some interesting b-sides, like ""Elephant Girl"" and ""What the Butler Saw"", the tracks are poorly selected and grouped on the CD."
3,I'd wait,"All of the episodes on here are from Season 3. There are some pretty funny episodes on here but if I were you, I'd wait until the Season 3 set comes out on DVD instead. Why? Well, because you get more episodes for about 25$ dollars more. Once all the seasons come out on DVD, all of these 8-episode DVDs will be no longer worth buying. Season 3 is scheduled to come out in October, so we have about 10 months still to wait. Anyway, here are the episodes on this DVD:1. ""Krusty Krab Training Video""2. ""Wet Painters""3. ""Can You Spare A Dime?""4. ""New Student Starfish""5. ""Missing Identity""6. ""Mid-Life Crustacean""7. ""Kraby Land""8. ""The Camping Episode""That's all the episodes, hope my review has helped you."
4,"Fantastic episodes,but no special features.","Sponge For Hire comes out November second 2004. It has 8 great episodes. The episodes are:1: Krusty Krab training video2: Can you spare a dime3: Missing Identidy4: Krabby Land5: Wet Painters6: New student starfish7: Mid-life Crustacean8: The Camping episodeNow these are all great episodes,but there are no special features on this dvd. But if you only buy these dvds for the episodes,then you should get this dvd.This dvd deserves four stars."

2,Boring,"This is my third CD by Jann. I just got it yesterday. Except for I would die for you, the songs are mundane and the music mediocre. This cd will not keep my from buying more, but it definitely did not rise to the heights the others did."
2,"Touching Music, but Bad Singing","I bought this cd because I wanted some more music akin to Sarah McLachlan--mellow, touching, beautiful. I think that this cd succeeds on the first two counts, but not the last. I really want to like this cd, I like the music, but her voice is absolutely annoying. She is *constantly* singing under pitch. On every song. Whenever one of her songs comes up on my winamp playlist, I find that I immediately skip to another song because her voice is so grating.Instead of this album, I would recommend Amanda Marshall's debut cd if you are looking for the same things I was."
1,I can't stand this heater,"We bought this heater for our 2 year old son's room about 6 months ago. We've had problems with it for a couple of months. He underheats or overheats the room by about 12 degrees about once a week. We live in San Franciso, it gets to 55 degrees at night in the Summer. It is frequently 60 degrees in his room when the heater is set at 71 degrees. Recently, the overheating has gotten bad.It is now 3am. He woke up and woke up my wife, our 4 month old and I because it is 87 degrees in his room with the heater set at 71 degrees.I no longer feel safe with this product in my house."
4,So glad that Amazon has Wings for Men,This is the only scent that my husband will wear. It is getting harder and harder to find this in a local store. I am so glad that Amazon carries this and at such a great price.
2,Not like the pic,"This item arrived messy and tangled. It is also not green and yellow, but green and white. I can use it for my purpose with a little fix up, but if you are looking for something green and yellow, this is NOT the item for you."
4,Great Stories!,I purchased this DVD for my children ages 3 to 6 and they love it! This was a great buy!
5,Good buy!,Got this for my granddaughter and she really loves it. Very sweet timeless tales - well done!
4,Love At 1st Sight is pure happiness...,"Mary J. Blige returns with another top 10 smash, ""Love At 1st Sight"" from her forthcoming album ""Love & Life"". You can hear a happier Mary not only by her extraordinary vocal range, but also by the words she sings: ""Looking at you from a distance/getting all of my attention/could this be love at 1st sight?""Blige re-teams with Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs on this song (along with Mario Winans) with moderate success. At first listen, it's nothing groundbreaking (the song samples A Tribe Called Quest's ""Hot Sex"") but after a few spins it becomes pure fun and happiness. It's no ""Family Affair"" but it comes close."
2,Not that great,She is a great artist but this one with Eve is not all that good it should be but its not.she disapoints on this songLyrics 4/10 Production 4/10 Overall 4/10
2,Lightening doesn't strike twice,while back in 95 when Mary Hooked up with Meth everything was cool&It didn't come across as Contrived as this attempt does.this track has Re-Mix written all over it at best.Mary&Puffy have the Best Chemistry together of all the People Mary has worked with but you can't go back into a time travel Machine&Re-Create 92-94.Her Vocals don't move me much anymore either.Props for using a Tribe Joint but this Song could&Should have Been Better for 03.it sounds like a 93 outtake that still ahsn't fully thawed out.
1,Fame Factor aka Great Set of Lungs...Great Set of Lungs,Who is the Rasputin-like character in Van's camp who has himutterly convinced that Brian Kennedy's voice is akin that of thebacking vocal ladies on Live in Belfast?
5,Sonic clearity...absolute VANtastic!,"I have almost every Van Morrison CD....but this is the clearest recording of them all. Add to that pleasant surprise was of the 10 songs on this CD..all ten were fantastic and easy to listen to over and over....A highly enjoyable listening experience....the best song in my opinion was ""The Piper at the Gates of Dawn""...WOW! If you like ""Van the Man""...this is a must have for your collection!"
4,Lean mean music machine,"Van runs the musical gamut from A to Z (also, his output can run the gamut from A+ to F). The 90s for him have been like the 80s for Joni Mitchell--creatively uneven but still always worth a try. Morrison comes out ahead in this comparison by virtue of his eye-popping prolificness - with him, more sticks to the wall because he throws so much of it.The Healing Game is a pivotal album in this cycle--it's tight, concise, with a crisp, understated sound. The songwriting is lean also--less visionary and more intimate. Most importantly, the album works as a whole, something that most of Van's more recent works have failed to do. This one's a keeper."
5,Excellent Music,"If a CD is playing in my home, chances are high that it is The Healing Game. This CD is just so good: It fits any mood, any situation. These songs are much more complex and textured than the kid stuff that made Van Morrison popular years ago. The Healing Game radiates the wisdom and musical depth that is borne of having really lived life. Anyone familiar with the ups and downs of Van Morrison's personal life will appreciate the lessons he has learned and his unwavering commitment to the beauty and power of his music and his spirituality. This CD is not to be missed."
4,A welcome return to form,"I have recently started listening to Van after having given up on him for several years. HEALING GAME is his best, and most consistent, work since AVALON SUNSET--and it comes close to the masterpiece level of NO GURU. The title track and, especially, ""Rough God,"" are tough and realistic without giving in to the ""pity poor Van"" crankiness that has made Morrison such an unsympathetic character on his other recent work. HEALING GAME is not, however, a perfect album: Brian Kennedy, although kept more or less in check this time around, is always able to bring down an otherwise fine song; the pretentious ""great god Pan"" references are beneath a lyricist of Morrison's insight (he really ought to stop reading Blake); the ""rap"" on ""Burning Ground"" is embarrasing; and the harmony vocal concept on ""It Once Was My Life"" is, although clever, forced."
5,This is one of his best albums and that is saying a lot.,"In my opinion Van Morrison is the greatest singer-songwriter alive- he has been turning out first rate material for over 30 years. This album rates among his top five- it is rich, complex and accessible to everyone. The song, ""Sometimes We Cry"" is one of his best- possibly the best since ""Cleaning Windows""."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,I had been having terrible problems with gastritis and GERD. I have taken this Manuka Honey as instructed for the last 10 days (1 teaspoon before each meal and 1 teaspoon before bed) and I feel so much better. I hope this continues. I was so happy that I re-ordered 2 more jars of the honey just so I don't run out. I have a sense of well-being since I've started using this product.
3,Not bad,"Manuka honey is very good for you but also generally overpriced. This honey has a Unique Manuka Factor (""UMF"") of 20+, which accounts for part of the high price. However, you can also get UMF 16+ for only about $30, which in my view is worth the savings. Bio Active has other products to choose from.If the UMF of 20 is important to you, this product is recommended. Otherwise, I would recommend a 2.2 lb jar of UMF 16 - slightly little more expensive, but twice as much honey."
3,muy caro,"Me decepcionó este producto, ya que es muy caro y su efectividad no es la anunciada.Yo compre otra miel para efectos curativos, con menor porcentaje bio activo y me funcionó mejor que esta.Además venía muy cristalizada."
4,A Good Collection of Powerful Stories,"Fr James Feehan as an experienced preacher knows the value of powerful stories in the pulpit. 'Story Power' is his contribution to the preachers and teachers who look for such readymade stories for illustration. The book consists of 125 stories neatly organized under 25 headings. There is a wide variety among them from fables to personal witnesses. Most of these stories end with a humorous twist so much so one cannot help reflecting upon the truth presented. Anthony De Mello was wise when he said, 'A story is the shortest distance between a human being and truth'. The book is an excellent resource for preachers.Xavier Thelakkatt"
3,Damage,"This book was interesting and well written. However, I found the ending tragic and very sad.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
4,Startling,Josephine Hart is gifted. Could not put the book down. I hope she has more like this book for me.
4,"Engaging, if not upbeat","A very sober novel in terms of content, but one that rings true and is well written. Does a good job describing how one's passion can overwhelm reason."
2,You Mean It's Not Okay To Sleep With My Son's Fiance???,"The premise of this book is that if you're a cold locked-up-hearted middle aged man, sleeping with your own son's fiance is not the way to go about livening up your tired & frosty life. Well, OBVIOUSLY! It's a rather plain novel about people with no boundaries and the ""damage"" their impulsivity and lack of sense can cause."
3,Modern Literature,"Bloke has affair with his soon-to-be daughter-in-law. Sounds familiar. The language of the narrative didn't seem accurate to real men, so I couldn't believe in it. (B)"
4,Interesting read,It have always wondered what goes on in a person's mind to make them suddenly derail their entire life. That is what attracted me to this book. It was interesting and so sad at the same time. Worth the kindle daily deal price. Not sure I would have felt the same way about full price.
3,Depressing to say the least,"This book managed to incorporate infidelity, obsession, incest, and just about any other significant character flaw you can imagine. I didn't take away any deep message in this story other than there are people with severe psychological defects with no apparent moral compass. Fortunately the plot moves at a snappy pace, dragging you from one illicit sexual encounter to another in rapid succession. Otherwise it would just be dreary porn.I seem to be in the minority, but I didn't find anything particularly revealing or insightful about human nature in this novel. This wasn't a bad book, just very average."
4,good but cant see any realizism,"THis did keep my attention but the reallity of the end seemed not very realistic, I feel thaT THE man would not have become unsocial for the lenght of time it is stated."
4,Believable except for the protangist,"I found the book believable except for the protangist. It was really like the cuckalod women trying to write the story from the adulatorous point of view. It's hard for them to see the motivation in the other women. She did, however, get the family part right."
2,big mistake,"I mistakenly bought this book through the Kindle Daily Deal - I mistook it for another novel with the same name. It was depressing. I guess maybe that I could give the writer an extra star for making me feel as crappy as all of the characters felt in the book, but that was definitely a feeling I don't want to feel again."
2,At least its better than her other so-called novels.,"Hart's clipped,stark call it what you will style is interesting...for the first few pages. It becomes increasingly obvious that this is not an artistic choice but a choice of necessity. Poor Ms.Hart has precious little to say or add to give her main character the breath of life (called depth by others). That said this is a novel full of promise which having perused her other efforts is never realised...it seems Hart is unaware of her strengths as a writer, for there are strong passages in this book but it is clear that she lacks self-awareness and maturity as a novelist. If you liked this novel do not read her other work or it will open your eyes to the limitations of her style and her intentions as a novelist."
5,Most moving book I have ever read.,"This book haunted me for weeks after having read it. I am surprised by some of the negaruve reviews found here. Each to his own, but if you have ever experienced a tragic love situation, and who has not, this will hit home. In my opinion, a very worthwhile use of trees."
1,Not worth the $1 it cost,"I bought this book several years ago at a book sale, and am now in the process of getting rid of books I have never read or probably won't. I decided to read this because of a quote on the back of the jacket by an author I really love, Ruth Rendell. She called it a ""remarkable first novel of awesome accomplishment and quite startling psychological insight."" I really have to disagree with Ms. Rendell on this one. It talks of a loveless marriage as the justification for his absurd obsession with Anna. But the glimpses of his married life show a comfortable, compatible relationship, which, after all, is what most couples experience after many years of marriage. If he needed excitement, he should have just taken up sky-diving and saved us all from this tedious, ridiculous tale!"
5,Best Compilation Album Ever,"This is the best compilation album I have ever owned. It has all of my favorite Christian songs, all of which are songs that sing praises to God or sing songs of sweet surrender. These songs hit me at a sweet spot. I know that the folks who put this album out were just trying to make some money off Christian music listeners, but they have no idea how helpful it is to keep me focused on my relationship with God when I'm working and when I'm at home.Used, it is the best music investment one could make."
5,Delightful and inspiring,This was such a delightful book to read. It gave great insight on how illuminations of the the day were made along with a wonderful story of a peasant boy who's small insignificant prayers were answered by a marvelousness and faithful God.
5,NPR Interview,"Actually....I havent read the book.However, I did listen to the interview last night (2/1/00) on NPR. It was one of the more remarkably clear descriptions of the complicated logical and reasonings used to determine what happened. Given the blurred interpretations of reality and undisciplined reasoning that predominates today's society (Monica scandal to NASA's estimating probability of failure on shuttle missions) it was refreshing to listen to a mind that didnt mince logic nor dumb down his reasoning. But what made the interview extraordinary was the eloquence with which the argument was made. It made following the deductions and reasonings a pleasant and even exciting experience.PS. Just picking: I have to disagree with his assertion that there is no such thing as proof in science. Proofs exist in the realm of mathematics and logic but no where else; e.g. if A=B and B=C then A=C. However, this point is irrelevant to his arguments."
5,Very happy!,It really sped up my computer. It works so well I can't hardly keep up with it. It works GREAT.
5,You must get this!,I just recieved my 512mb stick today for my 2.8ghz w/256mb of ram. I took out my 256mb stick and placed the 512 stick in and booted it up and automaticaly saw a huge difference. I could run my games at a higher detail and it is very stable. So I decided to mix the sticks together and now I run 760mb of ra (no problems). Awsome product.
5,Great plug and play!,"This was the max strip my PC was built to handle. Purchased 2 of them, plug and play, no problems what-so-ever!"
3,Check compatibility,"It works for a lot of people, but there are a couple different lines of Kingston, one of which wouldn't work in my Dell."
1,destroyed my computer,"I removed my existing memory in my comp and inserted the product. when i started up the comp, i got the beep codes for memory error.then i replaced it with my prior memory and the computer never booted back up.sadly a 30$ purchase has now caused me to spend 350$ on a new comp."
4,"Good Value, Good memory","i'm running on dell 4550 and this works great. compatability is not a major issue.-if your computer is extremely picky about RAM, this is NOT NOT NOT the way to go. You may need to use something like the more expensive HyperX"
4,Keep In Mind,"This memory came quickly. I needed to do a BIOS upgrade in order to use it because it's a faster memory. Crucial should not recommend faster memory then the manufacturer suggests without giving that warning. Otherwise, fine transaction."
5,memory review,I have an older E-Machines desktop. After installing a new security program I noticed that the unit had slowed down considerably. I upped the memory from 756 to 2g.It is working a lot faster now and I have encountered no problems.
5,Fast and Efficient,Got exactly what I needed. They estimated it would arrive in about 5 - 7 business days. I got it in three. Thanks guys!
4,Very nice.,"Very nice RAM. When I had an issue- I got an exchange no problem- no questions, replacement sent out immediately."
1,Caused my computer to reboot repeatedly,"I bought this product to speed up my computer, but instead it made no change in speed and caused my computer to reboot itself about every 20 minutes. How aggravating!I finally removed the RAM and started the process of getting it replaced through Kingston. There is no 1-800 number, so I have completed a series of online forms and each time waited on Kingston to respond to verify that I have the RIGHT to return the product. There are just too many hoops to jump through with this vendor, and I am not done jumping through all of them yet. Hopefully my replacement RAM will work better than the initial product.I won't do business with Kingston again."
2,Not Dual Channel Compatible,"Its works fine, no surprises except for the sticker on the box that says not dual channel compatible, I bought this to double my memory and use dual channel on my A7V, it says nothing about compatibility on the description. I'll stick with Newegg next time and use my gift certificates for DVDs like I usually do."
4,You can't really give a GREAT review about...,"...a stick of ram... But...I actually myself have four memory sticks in my computer, all different brands, and this one has affected my speed the most. I play Starwars games all the time (Republic Commando, Battlefront, Battlefront II, Jedi Knight - Jedi Academy, they all run much smoother with this addition.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars of rating, was because its really not worth giving it that much credit, if it only makes your computer run a couple of seconds faster. So don't let it ruin your buying decision, I would recomend it to anyone wanting to make games, and hevy duty aplications run faster."
5,Exactly what I ordered,This was exactly what I ordered adn it arrived when promised. It was easy to install.
2,Listed wrong,i returned the item after receiving the item was wrong part for me.when searching for 1gb sodimm pc2700 this item show up second in the list and is not a sodimm.
2,Keep Looking...,"Sssssssssllllllllloooooowwwwwwwwww.......Seriously, if you are looking to upgrade your 5 year old paperweight, then purchase this RAM. If you are building a computer from the ground up, you can spend a few more dollars and get a MUCH better product."
2,Bean Bag Battle,"The product was sent broken, poorly assembled, and glued together without screws. However, they did send new pieces after a few calls to customer service. I would suggest not dealing with this company!"
2,*sigh*,"People, don't waste your $$$ on crappy memory like Kingston, Simple Tech, PNY, etc. If your going to invest in new memory, go with either Corsair or Mushkin. Those are the two brands to look for in memory. If your on a serious budget, go with Crucial, though I highly recommend Corsair and Mushkin. Of the two, I happen to use Corsair in my gaming machine (i say machine because at first glance, it doesnt look like a computer, though technically it is :P), but it doesnt really make a difference."
1,"Not good compared to Crucial, PNY, even Apacer and K-byte","I used so many memories in the past. Kingston's memory is ranked the worst among Crucial, PNY, Apacer and even K-byte. Unstable among many computers.Some computers won't boot with this brand."
5,Solid performance in Dell Dimension 2400,"It's perfectly compatible with the existing 128mb RAM that came in the Dell. Yes, the Dimension 2400's came with only 128mb running XP - it took 2 years to figure out that was why my mother-in-law's computer ran at 1/10th proper speed, because she paid at least two different ""professional"" computer people $60/hr to ""help"" her. I never imagined that Dell was so low as to sell a dog like this at SAM's Club, and that the ""professionals"" had never checked the RAM. Having a total of 640mb now, it runs like a brand new system. Everyone is thrilled, because helping her is no longer a two-hour ordeal."
5,It goes zippy fast,"I've got an older emachines computer that froze up on a regular basis. Adding this extra RAM gave it that boost it needs to keep up with graphics intensive websites and graphics programs that I use as an artist.I'd recommend this item, definitely."
5,good deal,i have a dell 2400 Pent2.8 that came with 128mb for ram. i decided its too slow so i ordered this memory upgrade. i ordered it on sunday night and opted for the free super saver shipping. they said it would be 7-9 days but mine came on tuesday(just 2 days).i added it to my existing 128mb ram and now im running at 640mb of ram. works great.dell 2400 is running on shared memory. it means that ur video/graphics memory depends on your total ram. when i had 128mb of memory my video memory was only 32mb. when i got this upgrade (128+512=640mb)my video memory was at 64 mb. just get this upgrade rather than buying a 64mb video card.computer is faster and the video is a lot better.
4,Kingston ValueRAM 333MHz PC2700 Desktop Memory,"I ordered 2x1GB Kingston ValueRAM (KVR266X64C25) 333MHz PC2700 DDR DIMM Desktop Memory for a Dell Dimension 2400. The order arrived in a timely manner and was 2x1GB Kingston 333MHz PC2700 DDR DIMM Desktop Memory but was model (KTM8854/1G) for an IBM ThinkCentre Desktop. On top of that, there was no accompanying statment saying that a KTM8854/1G memory stick is compatable with a KVR266X64C25 memory stick.It was after much trepidation and searching on the internet (to see if these two cards were interchangable) that I finally bit the bullet and just installed them. Everything worked fine! I only wish this vendor had included a short statement saying that eventhough the product sent was not as ordered it was 100% compatable. The vendor did include instructions for RMA processing so I'm sure they would have replaced the memory if it had not worked, but that was of minor comfort."
5,Good memory.,My older PC already had 1 GB of this memory but still ran sluggish. I added another 1 GB and now this thing runs fine. I've used Kingston memory for years and never had a problem so I keep using Kingston memory when I can.
5,great place to deal with no problems,"the memory i got worked great, and was shiped right away will deal with them again"
4,A pleasant shopping experience,Shopping with Amazon is a no brainer. I have always recieved my purchase on time and have always been satisfied with the product.
1,BARF O RAMA!,"This is horrible. The concept does not even makes sense. It is even more horrible since the bands on this are really good. For a tribute cd, they assembled the hottest bands of the era.The problem is that it is not believable that artists such as Matthew Sweet, Cranberries and Sonic Youth were fans of these Carpenter songs. They are doing it as a goof. I'm a rock guy and will not like Carpenter tunes whether they are amped up or not.If Metalica did a Streisand cover, does that make it good? This was a horrible concept.With the exception of the ""Sweet Relief/Victoria Willams"" and ""Roky Erikson"" tributes (do you see a pattern...tributes to obscure artists?), most of these are horrible."
1,This Album is a Disgrace!,"This is no tribute. I am appalled! The Carpenters are my favorite group of all time and if you even like the Carpenters, don't waste your $ on this."
4,Superstars.,"This should appeal to those who either enjoy ""The Carpenters"", or the mid-90's alternative scene, and especially to those who like both. I'm one of those people. While I'm not a ""Carpenters"" fanatic, I do know all the originals enough to really like the covers. Almost all of these are good, but the covers by ""Shonen Knife"", ""Sonic Youth"", and ""Grant Lee Buffalo"" are great. My favorite might actually be from ""Sheryl Crow"". Her rendition of ""Solitaire"" is excellent. So basically, it's just a great ""Carpenters"" flavored alterna-sampler that most anyone should love playing on ""Rainy Days and Mondays""."
5,Awesome Twist on the Carpenters!,"This album has been one of my favorites for years. The interpretations are unique, yet familiar to the ear, and are very enjoyable! Only one or two ""stinkers"", but I give it 5 Stars for the strong remainder!Whether you're already familiar with the Carpenters or just starting to check out their work, this is a great alternative tribute!"
4,Interesting Comp,It's funny that when you strip away all the horrible over producing of Carpenter's songs you get some really neat pop songs. It's also interesting to see the reactions of fans of the originals freak out when they hear stripped down versions of them.Way down under all the cheesy instrumentation and 70's camp. They are solid songs. This Comp shows that wonderfully
3,Wrong Superstar,"This really should have included Bonnie Bramlett's (also the songs co-writer) soulful recording of Superstar instead of whatever that is on there. The Sonic Youth version sounds like Darth Vader on helium. The standouts here are: Shonen Knife Top of the World, Babes in Toyland Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft (a perfect song for Kat), The Cranberries - (They Long to Be) Close to You, 4 Non Blondes Bless the Beasts and Children, Sheryl Crow - Solitaire, Bettie Serveert - For All We Know. If you like any number of those artists this is worth buying."
1,Very disappointing,"One has to wonder whether this album just sounds bad or whether it was deliberately meant to sound that way. The sound is awful; so harsh, it is difficult to take in even small doses. Much of it sounds like a record running at the wrong speed. I strongely advise that you don't make the same mistake I made; don't purchase it without first listening to it. If you are a Carpenters fan, this is one you, no doubt, can do without."
3,Neither love nor hate it,OK these reviews are fairly polarised but somewhere in between lies the truth. Its not consistent but most of the versions are great and stand as a real tribute to the Carpenters. Plenty of irony here (sense of humor anyone?)and a bit of subversion maybe but the songs shine through. Highlights are American Music Club (Mark Eitzel's whole career has been informed by a modern slant on 70s sad songs) and Sonic Youth being as reverent as I've ever heard them. Worth a listen
3,"A mixed bag, but there are some real gems!","The sonic youth version of ""Superstar"" is so creepy! I love it! The male vocals do more justice to the lyrics of this song.The dishwalla version of ""It's gonna take some time"" will get in your skull and not let go...Much better than the original. (Except for Karen's angelic voice of course).Shonen Knifes version of ""On top of the world"" isn't very good, but It'll make you laugh to hear them sing this song with their japanese twist ....""Your Rove put me....On the of the word""!The Cranberies do an admirable job with ""Close to you"". Just like the dishwalla tune, the orchestration is much more interesting than the original, but you still miss Karen's voice.Tracks 8 & 13 are the worst. Uggh...I just skip over them!The rest are all pretty good too! Give it a listen."
5,Nice Tribute...,"I liked this album very much. However, you do have to be a fan of 90's Alternative Rock...if you are die-hard Carpenters fan you may not care for this CD. I really enjoyed most of the songs...and I actually liked Diswalla's version of ""It's Going to Take Some Time"" better than the Carpenter's version. (so did Richard Carpenter in a review he did of this CD) There were a couple of songs that made me cringe though...the ""Rainy Days & Mondays"" cover was HORRIBLE!... and I never liked ""Calling Occupants.."" no matter who covered it. All in all it's worth the buy...just be sure you enjoy the style of music these artists are famous for."
5,A Great Comeback,This album came after came after the 3 album deal with the Rolling Stones. I think that this album is supieirior to all of the albums off of the Rolling Stones LP. This whole album has a definite Peter feel to it mixed with alot of African drums which give it a unique sound. I recomend this to any reggae fan.
2,biting ryhmes was a crime in hip hop back in the day,"now evberybody's stealing rhymes even jay z who claims to make up raps in his head anyway timbaland spits rakim's old verses them missy spits ;yrics from mc lyte's classic paper thin, and magoo spits out special ed's old sheet I got it made.deserves no stars give it 2 for effort."
1,Falls Apart,I washed this one time and right after I washed it the little decorations all started coming apart and I washed it exactly how it said. Cute product but not made very well. I changed her bed set to care bears and made the bedset myself and it is still holding up. Even after potty training if that says anything about how often it has been washed and I have washed it the exact same way that I washed the other.
2,What a disappointment!,I purchased this bedding to go with the Dream Castle Toddler bed back in May. The pillow case is already frayed and the comforter is almost see through. The crown on the comforter has almost completely ripped off. I gently washed this bedding 1x a week and it has barely lasted 6 mths. It's such a cute pattern and it goes well with the Dream Castle bed. It's too bad.
1,"So adorable, but quality stinks.","Upon receiving these bedding sheets for my twin daughters, I was very excited to set up their new beds. Unfortunately, as stated by other customers the crown on the pillow cases and blanket have come loose and are starting to fray. One of the crowns on the blanket wasn't even attached properly and before its first washing it had to be reattached. If you do not mind poor quality, then this is the product for you. Very dissappointed."
3,toddler bedding review,"My daughter fell in love with this bed set at the store, and I do admit it's pretty cute, but the quality is rotten. The little appliqued crown on the blanket wasn't sewn correctly and is already fraying after owning for 6 hours and 1 washing. Also, the bow on the ballet slippers on the flat sheet had to be cut off because when I took it out of the dryer the ends were totally frayed. For as much as they charge for it, I expected something better. I gave it 3 stars because my daughter loves it (or I would have given it 2), it's truly adorable and the sheets and blanket (note: it's a polarfleece blanket, NOT a comforter) are very soft, but the sheets are so thin you can see right through them."
2,Glad I'm not the one who spent money on this,"My daughter received this as a gift. After the initial washing the ribbons on the top sheet were frayed and after just a few nights of use, the crown applique on the fleece blanket is coming off and fraying as well. Also, the sheets are very thin.It's cute and the fleece blanket is soft, which is why I gave it two stars. I also like that the flat sheet is fitted at the bottom so it doesn't slip out and need re-tucking all the time.All in all though, I would not reccomend this bedding set."
5,A terrific film about life!,"This is a fantastic film about real life and how love holds it together. It has a tiny bit of grit, just like our daily lives and deals with some heavy subjects like possibly losing a family member with a realistic approach. This movie is safe for my family and I suspect for yours as well. The kids (and adults) may learn something and everyone is certain to be thoroughly entertained. This is now on my Christmas movie list!"
3,sweet,"I remember seeing this the first time it came on TV lo those many years ago. I had not seen it again since then...it came to mind one day for whatever reason, so out of curiosity I checked Amazon and ordered it. As with many things we remember from the past, they are not always what we thought they were!! It's a sweet movie, and Patricia Neal is always worth watching. Love film to watch with the kids/grand kids"
4,Why Is It Not Shown On TV Anymore???,I'm going to order the Homecoming when we get back from vacation. I've looked for it every Christmas for the past ten years or more. Its not being shown on television for some reason. Does anybody know why? Too political perhaps?We loved watching it when it was shown in the 70's.
4,my christmas movies collection,I currently have a total of 8 christmas themed videos and this has definitely become the jewel of my collection. The Waltons is one of my favorite shows and I think it's neat that a show like this had such a warm and wonderful beginning
4,Family Greats,I remember watching this movie on TV way back in the early 70's and it always stuck in my memory. Re watching it I can see why they sure don't make this family heart wrenching stories like this today. Great for the whole family to watch.
4,When I was 10,"When I was ten, my family did not have much money. I remember switching around the dial of our black and white TV and watching this movie for the first time. The feeling I had was of having a warm blanket wrapped around me. The story was written so well that it spurred a the series that lasted for many years afterward. I strongly suggest this movie for the holidays as well for everyone in your family to enjoy for many years to come."
5,Homespun and Touching,"The Homecoming is required viewing for anyone that longs for the simplicity and wonder of Christmas-past. My ancestors are from Virginia and West Virginia and, though the movie could've been filmed in California, it conjures a warm feeling of the way Christmas used to be. I've always loved this movie and the actors create a cinematic feeling of love between the various family members. The music, the cinematic effects, the nostalgia, all combine for a Christmas viewing tradition. You will not be disappointed in this film that went on to become a successful television series. Merry Christmas."
5,Good family movie,"This is a great family movie, to share at Christmas and through out the year, very kid friendly as well."
1,The Homecoming,Not able to review this item as sadly the disc will not play in my DVD player. Obviously not compatible with DVD's in Scotland!! Very disappointing. Something worthing checking before purchasing.
3,Not as good as I remembered....,"I remembered seeing this, as well as the Waltons series, as a child, and ordered it for previewing to determine whether it should be added to our collection of Christmas movies. My spouse watched it with me, and, while we found it entertaining, we decided that our younger extended family members probably wouldn't care for it. Not sure it really stands the test of time, but then I can't stand to read popular classics like 'Little Women' anymore, either, so perhaps my tastes have simply changed. I think I will ship it to my parents, both of whom are 'Depression Babies' and who are nostalgic (if that is the right word) about that time."
3,oldie but goodie,"For those of us who remember watching this in the 70s, it still warms the soul when all is made right in the Walton family!"
3,don't let your little girls watch this!,"Now that I have your attention, I have to say that I have never forgotten the scene where the little girl opens her Christmas present, and the doll's face is cracked. I think that ruined the whole movie for me when I was little, so if you have a little girl, maybe wait until she's old enough for that shock."
5,Waltons Christmas,"I remember watching this when I was a little girl,I have been looking for it for years and I'm so glad that my Son told me to look for it on Amazon.com, I'm sharing it with my family, because that is what the movie is about family.A Big family full of love."
5,Great Christmas Movie,Great experience ordering - I received this movie sooner than expected. It is a great Christmas movie for the family. I am sure that my family will enjoy it for years to come. You can't beat some of the older movies.
5,JR in West Texas,"This wholesome classic from the 1970's was very heartwarming. A movie or series like this nowadays is very, very rare. A great movie to share with family or good friends near a fire on on a cold winter night."
2,Only the TV kids!,We were really unhappy to find out that only Grandma and the kids are the same as the TV series.
3,The Homecoming,"I love this movie. The quality of the picture could have been a little better. It had that ""old Movie"" look to it. But it was definitely clear enough to enjoy throughly.Great shipping..only 3 days!"
2,Not the best,"For all the reviews, this was quite disappointing. One expects a certain amount of sap in these shows, but this one went overboard. Overacted, and certainly not a cheery Christmas movie."
2,"the homecoming, a christmas story==waltons","this was ok,,but it isn't the walton we all have come to love and enjoy"
2,If you've loved the Waltons you'll be disappointed with The Homecoming,I thought I would start my family's initiation of the Waltons with where it began with The Homecoming. I had not seen it & expected it to be different but was thoroughly disappointed. The parents just DID NOT suit the rest of the family.The mother had a smoker's voice which was rather comical considering the wholesome family values she was supposed to stand for. She looked to be simply a Holywood actor without an ounce of motherliness to her. Her husband fitted about as ill in his role.This is certainly not one we will bother to keep on our shelves let alone watch again for pleasure.
5,A wonderful classic!,This movie is a classic in my family. Patricia Neal is just fabulous...(I like her much better than Michael Learned in her portrayal of Mama Walton). I could watch this over and over...truly gets you in the Christmas spirit.
5,The Homecoming a Christmas Story,I have loved this movie ever since it came out. I came from a big family and this is great.
2,Not a Christmas Favorite for the Kids,"I loved the original Walton's series, and remembered watching this movie as a boy. I was looking for a good holiday movie, and I thought I would add this to the list of movies we watch during the holidays, however, it's a bit slower moving than what I remembered, and because this movie precedes the original Walton's series, the different characters for the parents & grand parents make this movie less appealing than the original series.Even though my two son's loved the Walton's series, sadly they didn't enjoy this movie; unfortunately, it probably won't be a family favorite during the holidays."
5,Walton's fan,"This show is a must see every Christmas!!! You're never going to get a better ""family"" Christmas story illustrating what's important in life...what really counts. This takes you back to the basics before it became so spoiled with all the commercialism....a treat to experience."
5,Classic,Absolutly loved this movie. So glad I now have my own copy. This is great value for the price. Can't go wrong ordering this movie. Great for families
5,The best feel good movie ever,"I first seen The Homecoming, A Christmas Story when it aired on tv in the 1970's. The Walton's television show came after this movie. Of course, I enjoyed watching the Waltons, but the movie remained my favorite because it starred Patricia Neal, who did an outstanding performance as Olivia. I watch the DVD at least once or twice a year and tears still fill my eyes when John finally makes it home as Olivia leans against the doorway, relieved and crying. I feel connected with this movie, as I was born in a small town, nestled in the Allegheny Mountains many years ago."
3,Old-fashioned Christmas joy!,"I remember watching this movie on TV when I was a kid with my family every year at Christmastime. I have looked and looked for it for a decent price and finally found it on AMAZON. I hoped it would live up to my memories I had as a child, (sometimes movies don't hold up over time!) However, this one was very heartwarming and enjoyable. If you enjoyed the series ""The Waltons"", you should enjoy this movie because it was the inspiration for the series."
3,Everything is good except Patricia Neal,"One word: overacting. Major scenery -chewing going on here by Ms. Neal. Plus, I don't know who did the casting, but Ms. Neal looks old enough to be the grandmother. John Boy is supposed to be 15, so figure his mother to be in her mid-thirties, and Ms. Neal looks at least 55. Michael Learned was better in the role and much more believable as the mother.The missionary woman overacts terribly as well.Much prefer John Waite as Daddy and Will Geer as the grandfather."
4,Touching story of tragedy and hope,"This book was unique, telling the story of Clover, a 10-year-old black girl and her new white stepmother. Clover serves as the narrator of this mild tearjerker, and when her father dies just hours after his wedding to Sara Kate, she is left with a stranger to raise her. The story is well-told, convincing in the voice of a 10-year-old, but does tend to wander a great deal. It was difficult to keep up with the pace at times, but altogether an incredibly enjoyable read!"
3,Honest and plain speaking,"Ten year old Clover narrates her struggle to accept the loss of her grandfather and father and the acquistition of a white stepmother she barely knows. It is refreshing to read a novel so simply written, nothing overblown here. Southern customs and racial stereotypes color the story helping us to learn with Clover about the support and love that can found within our families."
4,Nice story,"Clover is the ten year old main characther, in this story of learning to deal with new things. When clover's father is killed in an accident, she expects to move in with her aunt and uncle, but instead her new stepmom, who is white plans to keep and raise her. Clover has to get use to a lot of new things, like eating different kinds of food, and just getting used to living with a stranger. I throught the book was good, and give reader's a look at two people from totally different ways of life learning to understand one another."
3,A good appetizer,"There are many books with African-American girls as narrators, so this book is not unique in any way. The Color Purple and the Bluest Eye have more tension, while the characters in Clover are all either good at heart or able to be redeemed. Even though the first person narrative is believable, it is not as impressive as Morrison's. This is a short and easy book, so it's a good appetizer before moving on to the more sophisticated novels."
3,Does show Racial problems from both sides,"Just think a two Race couple, get married in spite of all the controversary that surrounds that. Then tragedy strikes and the bride finds herself faced with a huge undertaking. She somehow works it out ! I and my Book Club watched the movie at our last meeting and we all agreed that we enjoyed the movie perhaps better than the book. It would be a good read for students in Grade school."
3,Not Stunning!,"Like someone else said...there are many books out there that have a young black girl as the narrator of her own story. The difference in this one, for me, was that I liked Clover. She was witty, smart, and had no problem with saying what she thinks even if it's only to herself. I was disappointed in the Sara Kate character because we never really got to know much about her before Clover's father brought her home as his new bride.Overall, it was an easy read and kept my attention, but never had the ""wow"" factor."
4,Cool Book,"I liked this book very much. It was very exiting and suprising. There were three very important charcters. They are Clover, she is the main main charcter there is Everleen, she is Clover's only aunt and there is Jim Ed, Clover's only uncle."
3,Jessica's review,Clover is about a little girl who has to live with her white stepmother because her father died in a carwreck.
3,Rock with passion,"It's not an essential colecction of great songs. It is more an interesting colecction of what a sixty group can do with just guitars, drums and an organ. It has its moments, like the wonderful ""All or nothing"" and other songs (""My minds eyes"" is a little jewel). Obviously, you can find the more important work of this goup in their post Decca recordigs. But, for a fan of good sixties rock, this record is important to complete a colecction. The best: the sound is very quite good. The worst: there is no detail information about the songs or the group (just a few fhotos and a some liner notes). Ow, just one more thing: Each cd has aprox. 45 min. of music. The price is right."
4,Indianapolis 500 Record Books,I have all of the Indianapolis 500 Record Books from 1968 to now. Everyone of them is filled with trivia and hard facts about the Indianapolis 500. These pocket-sized books are great gives for any serious Indianapolis memorabilia collectors.
4,I miss my keyboard,"This keyboard is in use daily for extended workdays for over two years, so has proved to be very durable. Was bought for ergonomic reasons; the touchpad has helped alleviate elbow and shoulder problems.I recently gave this keyboard to my wife, as her laptop keyboard and touchpad had stopped responding. She loves it, and I miss it! I will probably buy a replacement.Highly recommended, with some small reservations as listed below.Positives:- great touchpad.- after getting used to it, good key feel with positive feedback (short key travel)- good size, and good ergonimics- replaces two wires (mouse and keyboard) with one usb connector- no special drivers required; just plug it in and it worksNegatives:- Key placement took some getting used to (insert / delete / page up / page down).- Initially had some problems with repeating keys (debounce), but this went away with use- stiff left and right mouse keys (but they are hardly needed as the touchpad itself handles left and right click)"
4,Works with Apple,This does work with OSX and Apple computers. I wasn't able to find documented support of Apple computers anywhere online but purchased anyway and crossed my fingers. This particular model is PS2 only (there is a USB version sold) but it works flawlessly with a Adesso PS2-USB adaptor also sold by Amazon.
1,"Nice idea, poor quality","I bought one of these keyboards some time ago. Its good points are its small size and the integrated trackpad which eliminates the need for a separate mouse.Unfortunately, the mouse tends to suddenly receive focus while you're typing. It has happened to multiple people with this keyboard, so it isn't a matter of accidentally hitting the trackpad while I type.Now, however, that is no longer a problem since the trackpad has failed completely. I am able to use a separate mouse, but that begs the question of why I bought a keyboard with integrated trackpad in the first place. I am buying another keyboard with integrated trackpad, but I will avoid Adesso. Read Adesso's reviews, not only on Amazon but on other sites. They have a terrible track record for customer service as well as a poor quality product.In sum, this keyboard is a great idea. I just wish it worked as designed."
4,Revival in America,I study the First and Second Great Awakenings and this was a good translated primary source. The introductory biography was helpful atlthough a detailed index would be a great addition to this book.
4,awesome guide !,"what can i say -- this book gave me everything and more about what the average New Yorker needs to know regarding the subways, and the various neighborhoods and 'burbs they traverse. If you are a New Yorker, a tourist or anywhere in between, this book will help make the underground crawl a lot more tolerable. AWESOME GUIDE !"
4,"ARROGANT, POMPOUS AND A GREAT READ !","this book made me laugh more times than i can remember -- and if you're not prone to being offended by salty language and pompous wit, I'm positive that you will love this book as much as i did. A great New York epic in classic ""New York"" style."
3,"I enjoyed it, overall","The actors are terribly underdirected. Holly Hunter, as the lawyer, weirdly sports a clipped Texas accent in Marblehead, Mass, where the movie was filmed. Sarandon does a good job, but Dustin was all over the place with his character. I think the director was intimidated by him and just let him go. I thought Jake Gyllenhaal was autistic for the first half of the film. The one exception is the fantastic performance of Ellen Pompeo, as Jake's sudden new love interest.Acting students should note her performance behind the bar the day after she and Jake make love. She is washing out glasses while grooving to a Gary Glitter tune on the jukebox. The scene is brief and she doesn't even speak, but THAT's acting. She doesn't need directing.I really enjoyed it, but it could've been better."
5,Miles deep in the heart,"Moonlight Mile is one of the best films of 2002. It's fantastic script teeters on the edge of humor and heartache through out. It's sentimental nature never goes soft but instead always maintains an indifferent feel and for that remains believable.Joe (Gyllenhaal) loses his fiance' when she is killed in a disbute at a local diner. He stays with her parents Ben and Jo Jo (Hoffman and Sarandon) to work with Ben in Real Estate, to make up for his loss and to hide inner pain and secrets. When Joe meets and falls in love with a women, who works at a bar Ben is trying to close a deal on, the truth must be revealed. A touching, moving film about finding one's home and security gives a realistic look on dealing with loss and the road to recovery. Spectacular performances from Gyllenhaal, Hoffman, Sarandon, and newcomer Ellen Pompeo respectively."
2,A long mile to go,"Good premise and story line, for the most part a decent dialog, outstanding acting (except for the sleepwalking Gyllenhaal), so what's missing? What's missing is plausibility. A movie about grief doesn't have to dwell on it, but it MUST show early on that the grief is there. If this is done properly, the viewer will accept even the most outlandish behavior as a character's way of dealing with that grief. Kasdan did it brilliantly in 'The Big Chill,' with a mere thirty seconds of Glenn Close sobbing in the shower. Silbering failed to do anything like that in `Moonlight Mile,' so the eccentric parents and the goofy fiance seem uncaring and preoccupied only with themselves. I couldn't overcome it, even though I tried for a good while. By the time Gyllenhaal bares his soul in court it's way too late; what might otherwise have been quite affecting seems only outlandish."
4,"Flawed, But Beautiful","There are some wonderful things about ""Moonlight Mile"", director Brad Silberling's semi-autobiographical new film. In presenting the grief of losing a loved one in a violent and sudden manner, it's nearly flawless. The moments of quiet humor piercing the claustrophobic clouds of grief felt so genuine; I found myself often thinking, ""That's really what it's like!"" The bewilderment, aimlessness, and absolute confusion in the face of tragedy are brought vividly to life by the wonderful acting of Susan Sarandon and Dustin Hoffman, as the parents of a murdered girl, and by Jake Gyllenhaal, the fiance. These performances are absolutely outstanding in their juxtaposition of pain, anger, sorrow, helplessness, and the desire to carry on. While the film occasionally seemed melodramatic and patchy in a way that I can't yet really identify, it was still very affecting. ""Moonlight Mile"" is well worth experiencing."
1,overrated and corny,"I hardly ever give a movie one star, but this movie was just so overrated. I really wanted to like it. Three powerhouse actors, and what seemed like a good story. But the director uses so many corny devices that it is almost painful to watch. For example that seen where Jake is being dragged around the post office by his dog. There were numerous others. I am sorry but this movie is one of the years disappointments. The acting was good, very good. But even the talent and effort of these magnificent actors couldnt save this cheesy, cornball drama."
1,Uncomfortable and Implausible,"Great actors aside, this movie seemed implausible and made me feel so uncomfortable, not from grief but from implausibility. The couple that lost their daughter uses the to-be son-in-law, over and over through various things that they ask him to do, we see him be used. No regard for his grief, which we can only guess he must feel.It was painful to watch this. Then to add pain to the ""using"" and total disregard for this man, we see him being attracted to a girl he just met. This is 4 days after the death. Absolute nonsense. It wouldnt happen. No man who was in love and about to be married and had his fiance die, would do it. Implausible, ridiculous.There is another scene that is implausible and so uncomfortable. One of the dead girls close freinds flirts with the fiance. Too much.At this point, I left. Waste of time, no point, uncomfortable ""non standing up for himself"", people ""using him"" and implausible. Dont waste your money."
2,Moonlight Mile,I watched it just to see Ellen. It was a bit shallow. Ellen acted just as if she was Meridth in GA.
2,Moonlight Mile,"I really did not like this movie at all. The reasons for the characters doing the odd, or on the verge of stupid things, were all because of really dumb routes of logic that they used to evaluate their situation. I guess you could say that the movie was okay because the purpose is to get a reaction from the audience, but if these were real people I could not see being their friend because of how strange they are. More like they were not written as believable characters. The movie came in good condition as promised and i recommend buying from this seller, but I did not like the movie that I bought of my own rotten decision."
2,Uninteresting people.,"Moonlight Mile starring Susan Sarandon, Dustin Hoffman, and Jake Gyllenhaal is a overwrought drama to say the least. The characters lack compassion and I just couldn't get into the static storyline. The only actor and character I felt was real and adorable was a pre-Grey's Anatomy star Ellen Pompeo. Pompeo was a bright shining star even back then, she nailed every scene - and why is Katherine Heigl getting all the attention, Pompeo is the real deal! This movie is stinker, the only saving grace is well you know who."
2,hamper,"Although it was a beautiful hamper, I found that the wood broke after about 3 months but not before the lining for the hamper ripped. All we had in it was baby clothes and i was unhappy with this purchase. So we went back to babies r us and bought a new one that is still cute. Its from wicker and it has the lining and everything."
2,not too good,"not too good - the one I got for my W123 was way more helpful, not worth the trouble getting it"
3,Review of Haynes manual for Mercedes 190e 1984-1988,I rate the book 5 on a scale of 1 to 10. Considerable material left out. Doesn't even tell how to change the oil and oil filter. I own a 1986 Mercedes 190e and the manual shows how to remove the radio which isn't correct for my car. Somewhat satisfied. I would rather have paid more money and have had a more complete manual.
5,Very helpfull,My husband finds this book very helpfull as he repairs all our auto's this book is easy to understand.Also very informative.Good car repair book
4,Great WWE,"Great DVD -- Wish they could add more to this set, but they always have great DVD -- Good Work"
3,where are they ?,"this has only a few classic mathches we need to see the 60s and 70s the shiek vs abdullah the buthcher, bruno vs larry szbisco killer con vs bruno the miller bros vs the morties gene coninski vs fred blassie waldo and fritz von erichs vs the kngaroos the shiek vs bruno and so many others are these lost or what ?"
2,"Mediocre, Disappointing Selection of Matches","The match listing here is lacking, and while not horrible, should contain classics like the Empty Arena match with Mankind vs. The Rock and the Royal Rumble 2000 Street Fight of Cactus Jack vs. Triple H. Just a letdown here with a lot of DVD repeats and duds."
5,A game to remember!,Truly everything a computer game needsDown sideYou need a 3dfx video card on a agp 4x slot for the best look.There is a software mode that is playable but I miss the smoothGraphics. I got 2 voodoo 5 5000 just to play this game in full beautie.A must buy!
3,Not bad for a quick read,"I took this as part of an Amazon buy deal, with ""The Mission Song"", was the second part. This was by far the better book. The plot is kind of hokey, the characters belong in a 1944 spy movie, and the style is in that genre. I read this while sitting in the backyard by the pool. It is a very good book for that setting. It can be put down at any time, and picked up again without great mental effort. You do not need to worry about a lot of mental gymnastics to enjoy the book. I probably will not buy any more Billy Boyle books, but it was money better spent than the funds wasted on the Le Carre book."
2,A Big Disappointment!,"I was very much expecting to enjoy this book based on its seemingly interesting premise -- i.e., that of a young Boston Irish cop who finds himself in the thick of wartime intrique when he becomes General Eisenhower's personal investigator. Unfortunately, Billy Boyle was a big dissapointment to me. The plot was very slow-moving, the characters were somewhat stereotypical, the mystery was not very mysterious and the excitement level was tepid at best. The biggest mystery to me about this book is why I bothered to finish it. Do yourself a favor and don't be misled by the mostly favorable reviews about Billy Boyle on this site."
3,Lukewarm for Benn,"I'm lukewarm about this; I'd have been disappointed if I were expecting more. Yes, the characters are stereotypical but they're well drawn. The plot takes a long time to get there but somewhat pulls together at the end. Not much thriller (even in what should be the thriller parts). Overall character-driven and not plot-driven.I MUCH prefer Aaron Elkins to James Benn (both his WW-II era books as well as his anatomy expert series). I think Elkin's Turncoat and Loot are much better WW-II or post-war stories."
4,"Good read, a little rough towards the end.","This is my kind of book...murder mystery and spies in a World War II setting. I loved the first half or more of this book and was looking foward to a 5 star rating. But it unraveled a bit towards the end, getting off what had been a great pacing. Some artificial elements made me grumpy. Still, a good read and I'm looking forward to the next."
4,A real treat of a mystery,A great commuter book. Takes you away from modern day worries and immerses you in England in WWII. The mystery plot has intrigue and just enough twists to keep you guessing. You're left wanting to know more about the characters next adventure.
5,Billy Boyle: A WWII Mystery,"A fresh, well written, innocent mystery that seems historically accurate. Very enjoyable."
1,Pffttt!!,"What a disappointment! I had come to greatly rely on Amazon reviews because I usually find them to be far more accurate than the blurb on the dust jacket. I had also come to trust Soho Press for publishing great atmospheric mysteries. This book is a hodge podge of stereotypical characters. We have an Irish Bostonian, a glamorous English woman (also the daughter of a Knight) and a Polish Baron. How hackneyed can you get? There is also this really irritating running joke where the Bostonian has to explain his slang to the Baron. Methinks this book would do very well in middle America but for the more worldly, I'd suggest you give it a pass."
4,Accurate Portrayal and Likeable Characters,"A good writer makes you care about the characters he or she creates. In the case of Billy Boyle I was, at first, a little indifferent to the fate of Billy as he came off as a little casual in his attitude to the war. however, I later realised that Billy's perspective was just a little more parochial than we've come to expect in modern times and was perfectly in tune with the times being portrayed.After a chapter or two I became engrossed with how the mystery was to be solved, but more than that, I was interested in how the characters reacted to the situations and, when something untoward happened to two of the main protaganists I realised that I cared about their fates. A mark of a good writer.I would certainly reccommend this book to others and am eager to read more from James Benn."
2,Billy Boyle WW2 Mystery,"Although the book was well written, I just could not get into it. I thought it was very boring and mundane. Perhaps men would enjoy this book more than I did."
4,Good Historical Fiction,"I enjoyed this historical fiction novel set in 1942 London. It was a mystery of sorts told from the perspective of Lieutenant William ""Billy"" Boyle.I liked the mild touch of humor interspersed throughout the story as Billy would make comments to himself about finding himself alone in London, yet always able to find a friend at the local pub.I also like how the author would include reflections from Billy on things his father shared with him as he was growing up, and later as Billy worked his way up the ranks in the Boston Police Department."
3,Approach with caution,"I really thought the premise of the book was outstanding---a little history, a little mystery, some detection. A great character but the first novel is a slow, slow read. This is the first book in the series and if I ever get through it I might just checkout a second to see if the author has picked up the tempo..."
5,What a refreshing read!,"I am not a writer, just a fan of good books that read fast. I thought this book was well written with some really funny lines. The internal thoughts of the main character are spot on with how he interacts with others. Again, I am simply an avid reader but do not read many ""mystery"" books but I really enjoyed the first one and am loving the second one as well. It is a bit over the top sometimes but I feel it goes well with the storyline."
4,Billy Boyle has it all!,"Billy Boyle is a WW2 Mystery Series, historically set in 1942 London.I loved it, Billy Boyle has it all!I found Billy Boyle to be intriguing and a very good read.This mystery includes not only an Irish detective, but also Eisenhower, traitors, treason and murder, a spy, and even a little romance and humor.I found Billy Boyle to be well written, the characters take on life and the book is filled with adventure, history and action. It is a wonderful mystery based on true facts from the war (which are well researched).Thanks Goodreads!"
3,Easy read that's fun but predictable . . . .,"The characters are never fully developed in this story of a Boston cop in 1942 England, but it is easy enough to forgive this shortfall and fill in the blanks yourself in this fun, easy read. Although the plot is predictable, it does not take away from the atmosphere of 1942 England and the war. If you're looking for something historically in depth and fully developed, find something else, but I recommend this as a fun historical fiction to read."
4,Quaint entertaining book,Billy Boyle is a very likeable character. He is a naive Boston detective who fortunately watched and listened to his father - a very experience Boston detective. He is thrown into investigating murders and seeking out a spy in unfamiliar England. James Benn the author has researched the era well and this book is both entertaining and educational. A thoroughly enjoyable read.

2,Won't what I expected!,"First of all the cd had only 4 songs on it. That was not the cd that was made ""back in the day!"" Sorry it just was not the one. I do not like the cd."
2,Yellow Smelly Pages but has CD,The older PC book was yellowed and smelled bad - fortunatley there was a CD - I threw the book out - chapters are on the CD as PDF files - seller should mention if a book is really bad as far as odor from being old - glad it came with a CD however
1,This book needs to be retired,I've taken a Windows 95 course and studied this book prior to taking the 070-064 Exam. This book had very little in it to prepare me for the exam which I failed. This book needs to be retired and a new one written to prepare you for the new Windows 95 Exam.
4,It sure helped me,"This book was the only book I used to pass my Win95 test (70-63). Anyone who thinks that they can come in cold, buy a book and have all the answers to pass the test is an idiot. If you don't do the hands on work you will not pass. If you combine this book with some hands-on real world experience you should have no problem passing the exam. The publisher does need to incorporate more of the scenario type troubleshooting questions, but the subject matter was right on."
1,Not for MSCE Test Candidates,"This book is not for the serious MSCE Candidate. It is full of the authors' opinions instead of the facts that you need to know to pass the exam. The Review Questions were much too easy and were poorly written. I passed the exam, however I credit the MS Resource Kit with providing the information necessary to understand the material and pass the exam."
4,Easy to read; comprehensive preparation for the exam,"Already having several years of solid experience with Windows 95, this book was a good aid to my passing the Windows 95 exam. It is well laid out and easy to read; my only cricticism is that is a little repetitious between chapters at some points. Having a PC to play with whilst studying is almost essential as you read the book. I would recommend the book to others without a doubt - read the book cover to cover, do the practice tests and use the handy objectives list and you should comfortably pass the exam. Phillip Dundas MCNE, MCP"
4,Above average,"This book was much better than another I had used (tho after taking - and passing! - the test I thought it could have been more complete in the Novell networking section). I'd recommend it over other books I used and looked at for study. It has a pretty good test bank, too. Very similar to the real test."
5,Nothing to compare with PureAyre,I had found this product in a country general store in Washington State last summer. I only bought one small bottle as I had NO IDEA how awesome this product really is! I had gotten a mouse in the ventilation system of my car and nothing would remove the odor until this came along. I would recommend it for anything. And it doesn't leave any lingering overpowering scents!
5,Awesome overview of one of country's greatest careers!,"This CD is awesome from beginning to end. It has all of his greatest songs here, from ""I Love The Way You Love Me"" and ""Life's A Dance"" on his debut to the beautiful ballad from his latest album, ""Pictures"", called ""Til Nothing Comes Between Us"". His career has undeservedly struggled the past few years, and radio has practically ingnored him, despite him putting out his best music on ""Home To You"", ""Brand New Me"", and ""Pictures"". I like the two new cuts, ""Cool"" and ""One Day Less"". My personal favorites are ""I Swear"", ""The Little Girl"", ""How Was I To Know"", ""Home To You"", ""Angel In My Eyes"", ""Hold On To Me"", and ""Til Nothing Comes Between Us"". It may be a little heavy on the ballads, but that's what John Michael Montgomery does best. I thought that none of his last three albums sold as well as they should've, and I hope he can revive his struggling career with this awesome set. He's got one fan here who hopes he can. Keep trying, John Michael."
4,Best Hits,"If you like JMM, this collection covers the best. A great deal for those who miss the classy, smooth style of 90's country."
5,Phenominal Band,"The Moody Blues are a treasure They've stopped creating music, but the body of work will live in my generation's soul and takes us back to our youth. If you don't know the Moodies, sample ""Days of Future Passed"" and you'll be on-board for life."
4,A simple collection for the connossieur,For one who believes in the band's offerings. An easy paced collection from all that moody blues have played for their audience.
3,Bonus Disc or Bogus Dissed,The only reason for a real Moody Blues fan to buy this would be to get the bonus disc #5 ... which features Highway and This Is The Moment. Where is it?
5,Moody Blues,I wanted a copy of this CD because this music was taken into space on the space shuttle. I am happy with the cutomer service I received. Thanks
3,Cute!,"Adorable costume for my son! Looked really cute. The feet didn't stay attached, but no big deal. I bought a larger size, so hopefully we can get another year out of it."
4,Good first book.,"I've enjoyed the good doctor's short stories on literoctia for quite some time and this is a very good first effort. I enjoyed the first half better than the second, since it focused on the relationship between the husband, a maledom and his new wife, the unwitting female submissive. During the second half the wife seemed to fall prey to everyone she met, everyone but her husband. I'm not a writer so you'll have to go elsewhere for a summary, but if you want a hot read this just might do you. It's certainly a cut above the half dozen other books I've read from Ellora's Cave."
2,"Pics are great, text is sorely lacking","I was VERY disappointed by this book. Yes, the pics are great, but it would've been nice to have some text to go along with them (i.e. background stories, behind-the-scenes anecdotes, interviews...)!"
5,Easy Cajun Meal,"I used to get these in the grocery but they are no longer available locally. These are great one box meals with the addition of sausage, seafood, and extra vegies. I usually make up two boxes and have great leftovers for weeks. The one box dinners that are still available in the local grocery stores are terrible in comparison."
2,cliche ridden ...,"I like Dennis Hopper and love Frederick Forrest. Neither of them are bad considering the atrocious dialogue and tired premise that they have to work with. They seem to be rolling their eyes at each other as they speak their lines. Sad to see such great talents wasted in a film filled with gratuitous violence and terrible ""pop psychology"" dialogue. Was there a point to this film?"
2,Bottom of the barrel Hinton,"There have now been several compilations of Eddie Hinton demos and so-called ""outtakes"" released. This is not the one to start with. In fact, this should be reserved for true Hinton completists, of which there can't be just a whole lot around. Recommended: HARD LUCK GUY."
2,A Book For When You're Bored,I had to read this book for a project at school and I thought My Side of the Mountain was boring. Then I read On the Far Side of the Mountain and I thought that was better than the first. Then finally I read Frightful's Flight and I learned so much. I learned a lot about falcons and how to take care if them. I enjoyed this book and I thought it was a lot better than the first two. But I still think that this book is better to read when you're really bored.
4,Good... but not as good as the first,"I really liked this book, but I have to say, it is not as good as the first book. This book is about Frightful becoming a mother, and pretty much most of her life. I liked this book alot, even though I didn't like it as much as the first one."
5,CREEEEEEE!,"I did this book for a book review at my school and LOVED IT! I couldn't put it down. It is beautifully written with the bird's point of view mixed in. Soon after i finished it, i gave it to my brother and it became overdue from the library because he was still reading it! My brother and I agree that it is an exciting and touching book. We reccomend it to you!"
1,One star is too many,"I read ""My Side of the Mountain"" as a child. It remained one of the few children's books that I reread once a decade or so. Then I read the second book. Not as good, but sequels seldom are. Then I read this piece of excrement. Thankfully, I borrowed it from the library and didn't pay any money for it.Mrs. George takes her wonderful tale and turns it into this tiresome ham-fisted tirade against business and government. There's an awkward screed against one group or another in every chapter - with only a few of the ""enlightened"" not tarred and feathered.I used to be a fan. Now, I doubt I'll give my niece and nephew any of her books for fear they might read this one."
4,My 10 year old nephew loved it!,I bought this for my 10 yr old nephew and he loved it. I believe he finished the book in just a few days. He lvoes reading the Jean Craighead George books.
2,not road-worthy,"this unit does it's job but is not road-worthy. I could tell that it was not going to lasat forever the first time I plugged my XACT unit into it. pushing the buttons on the unit or hitting bumps in your car puts pressure on the audio, antenna and power conections. The base lasted me 10 months, which is longer than I expected. I started getting cut-outs and garbled reception and plugging into a brand new base fixed the problem immediately. Since the base is the only way to power the unit or make it communicate with a stereo, I recommend finding the XACT unit with the car kit, instead of the universal kit or buying the XTR2CK, which looks like it comes with a much superior mounting device."
4,Howard Stern now available,We had some issues with a lost shipment. Amazon made it good and I can now listen to Howard in my office and my home. I have been a Sirius subscriber since 12/04 just waiting. Amazon has become a good source for accesories to a receiver that is outdated already.
1,Discontinued Xact Model. Buy a new unit for less than this accessory,"This universal kit is for a discontinued Xact model. I purchased 3 of them in the past 5 years for around $20 each. If you have the old XS01UK unit, DO NOT invest any more money as they fail after a year or so. Spend the money on a newer model and accessories."
3,vague opinion,"A rather long read, though the case studies are supremely useful. Dosen't have the CD-ROM full of useful programs that other books in this field have. Useful, but generally long-winded."
3,What? No pockets??,"These shorts are very comfortable, and look great. The only problem with them is that they have NO POCKETS! I am a pocket-horder, so this does not work with me."
4,"Comfortable, light weight, good pair of shorts.","I just recieved these shorts in the mail ahead of schedule. They are comfortable and light weight. However, be aware that they do not have pockets. These shorts are good for the price. The only thing keeping this product from a five-star-rating is that the description doesnt tell you that the shorts don't have pockets. Otherwise, I am happy with the purchase."
2,I know how to Cook Non-allergenic food like Speghetti & Grits - Nothing amazing at all about the recipes,"This book is simply a recipe book which replaces eggs & nuts in recipes with name brand egg-substitutes and such. There are tons of references to specific brands of ingredients.And the remainder of the recipes are simple every day recipes.. that dont have eggs in them in the first place.Yes.. I know how to cook oatmeal, grits, or speghetti without using eggs and nuts.There are much better books out there."
3,Interesting,"I origally bought this as I have a child with allergies. Some of the recipes look interesting, and maybe i will try them, someday. But i cannot find many that will appeal to my child. Except the Chicken Nuggets - although these are made with beer. I thought beer had wheat, and i don't think i'll be making my child a dinner with Beer. Nor do i think i can trick my husband into eating lasagna composed entirely of vegetables."
4,Excited to try it!,I was stuck in a serious allergy friendly food rut and can't wait to try some of these recipes. Baked goods have proven to be the most unique challenge and am glad someone has already done the work!!
1,Waste of time and money,"This cookbook is a waste of money. The recipes are not for people with multiple food allergies and/or sensitivities, including some of the most common ones. Some of the ingredients are so out there. It is not practical. The recipes also require so many ingredients. It's ridiculous. Don't waste your money."
1,Not Impressed,My son has an egg and nut allergy. Basically this cook book recommends the ener-g egg replacer as a substitute for eggs in every recipe. I can make my own recipes and do that!
1,Not useful if you're looking for gluten-free baking or easy dishes for kids,"*Be sure to check out sample recipe before you purchase this book.* I'm most disappointed with the baking recipes. My son has multiple food allergies and the most challenge I have is baking with no gluten, eggs or dairy. This book avoids wheat, but uses barley flour, spelt flour instead, both of those contain gluten. Also, if you're looking for recipe to cook for your toddlers/young children with multiple food allergies, this may not be the book for you. The recipes use many ingredients and most of them are not so easy. With an active toddler and food allergies, I don't have time to cook these complicated food."
5,"Finally, some good recipes!",I have been searching for creative things to cook with limited ingredients for so long. This cookbook is great! I love how the author has adapted such exotic and fun recipes. I really liked the orange zucchini bread.We don't have a Whole Foods store where I live but I was able to find a lot of things at Walmart and a little natural food store we have here.
2,NOT gluten-free,"I bought this book based on the glowing reviews here. I was deeply disappointed. My main objection is that most of the ""wheat-free"" recipies replace wheat flour with barley flour. If someone is reactive to wheat, most likely they are reactive to the gluten in wheat and barley flour contains gluten (as does rye and possibly oat). Only a couple of the recipies using flour use a gluten-free substitute. Bummer."
5,Fantastic Allergy info,This book is a God-send....It is simply written and products are readily found. It makes problems with allergies seem an everydaything....No more mindless wandering the Supermarkets...This makesallergy problems disappear.
4,"Love the recipes, hate the index","I turn to this cookbook time and time again and would eat many of the recipes even if we weren't dealing with multiple food allergies. The index, though, drives me completely bananas. It's very difficult to find a recipe without paging through the whole book or the section you think the recipe might be in. If it weren't for the index, I would give this a five-star review."
4,Yummy!,"As a working mom in an allergic and food-sensitive family, I am always looking for easy and creative alternatives. Every recipe I've tried from the Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook has been delicious. If there is an ingredient I question or am unfamiliar with, I substitute something tried and true.My kids have no idea how healthy they've been eating!"
5,Has great solutions for my food allergic child,"Bought this book when my 8 mo dd was diagnosed with multiple food allergies (egg, wheat, dairy, soy, nuts, tree nuts, tomato, onion, and others) Just learning how to make a chocolate cake for her first birthday made the book worthwhile. Also love the pancake recipes and am happy she can eat the kinds of things we do. (Some family members say the baked goods taste ""Healthy"" but I think they are good.) Not all of the recipies are kid friendly, but we will grow into them. I plan to use the recipies when pregnant with #2 to try to avoid allergies in next dc."
2,Not O.K. for Multiple Food Allergies,"Bought this book hoping I could stop making 2 menus for each meal because of my sons multiple food allergies. Some of the recipes are really good. However just about every one of them calls for either Spelt flour, Oat Flour, Oat Milk or Barley Flour.... and my son is allergic to these. So about half of the recipes I tried turn out horrible because I tried substituting on my own for these ingredients. Plus a lot of these ""speciality"" ingredients that the author suggests you keep in your pantry are realllly expensive.There's probably a better book out there. P.s. The recipes are not gluten free!"
5,Excellent cookbook,"When I found out my daughter had multiple food allergies, I was very upset, and particularly worried about what, and how, to feed her. I got a bunch of cookbooks out the library that were ""allergen"" free, but this is the only one I have found that is free of all the most common allergies AND most importantly, is a great cookbook. I was surprised at how tasty all Pascal's recipes were, and her writing style is lovely, too. She loves food, it's clear, and loves eating and living in a healthy way, without it becoming boring or burdensome.I can't say enough about how great this book is. Very worth owning it!"
1,Not so helpful...,I was dissapointed as the baking recipies all need egg replacer. Otherwise the recipies are the same as what I have in an everyday cookbook.The brand's being mentioned also aren't readily available in Australia so it is a bit hit and miss with the quantities of replacements.
2,"Out of 200, a few useful recipes","I have not yet found a cookbook that significantly fits my dietary needs. I need no gluten, no dairy, no corn, no vinegar. My husband needs also to have no eggs. There are 3 or 4 recipes (out of 200!)in this cookbook that I found useful. There are increasing numbers of people and their health practitioners who are realizing the vast problem of yeast in our typical diets, and this requires the elimination of all yeast, sugar and vinegar-containing products. These people are also realizing the overdose of corn we are all getting from corn syrup being in almost every product on grocery store shelves (seriously, other than the produce section try finding 10 products without corn syrup in a standard grocery store!) and thus many people now have sensitivities to corn and most of us should be cutting back on corn products anyway. Also, most corn now is GMO or contaminated by GMO which is a huge concern."
3,Microwave your onion?,"The book is compliant to it's mission of providing recipies for those with allergies.But it is not for the experiences cook.If you are a novice in the kitchen and need some help,this book may be for you.But if with a creativity and thought, the experiencedgormet can come up with their own wonderful allergy-free recipies.Bon Appetit!"
1,NOT WORTH IT AT ALL,DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT - ALL THE RECIPES ARE DIFFICULT AND REQUIRE ALL SORTS OF FANCY INGREDIENTS THAT THE AVERAGE PERSON DOES NOT HAVE IN THEIR KITCHEN. MOST OF THE RECIPES DO NOT EVEN SOUND GOOD! I WASTED MY MONEY WITH THIS BOOK.
3,Sophisticated recipes-gourmet for the allergic,"This is a fantastic cookbook, but if you are cooking for a child with multiple allergies you are already struggling with some difficult cooking techniques. As other reviewers have mentioned, the main flour the author utilizes in her recipes is barley, followed by oat. Barley is not easily substituted,(I tried) and has a signature taste that makes these recipes work.The author does a wonderful job of describing ingredients, specifically natural sugar substitutes. Enlightening, but not a cooking bible for the allergic.I'd love to see another cookbook by this author without the barley flour!"
3,Misleading...,"It may be just a problem with Amazon and not the actual book, but this book was on the recommendations for food intolerances (such as gluten intolerance). Every recipe that uses flour calls for oat and barley flour, neither of which can my family eat. Also, I didn't find very good substitution information, either. Just substituting Amaranth flour for Barley flour will not produce the same results in a recipe, due to the lack of gluten.I was very anxious to receive this book, and was very disheartened upon reading it."
1,WARNING - THIS IS NOT A GLUTEN-FREE COOKBOOK!,"Please be careful as this book is not a Gluten-Free Cookbook. I bought this book because I am Gluten-Intollerant, Lactose Intollerant and Egg Intollerant. However, many recipes call for the use of Barley, Oats, Rye, Spelt and she even recommends certain beers such as Corona and Sam Adams in some recipes - all of these have GLUTEN in them. She does make a statement in the book that states ""This cookbook avoids foods that cause food allergies, but does not address food intolerances."" I would not have bought this book had this been posted somewhere on this website. I feel the title of this book is deceiving as it leads you to believe that it addresses all food allergies including Gluten and it does not."
5,A culinary wealth of dishes that would serve any dinning occasion from simple family meals to festive celebratory occasions,"Eliminating all eight of the allergens responsible for 90% of food allergies, the two hundred gourmet and homestyle recipes comprising The Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook by hypoallergenic cooking expert Cybele Pascal offer a culinary wealth of dishes that would serve any dinning occasion from simple family meals to festive celebratory occasions for anyone with a common food allergy. With easy-to-follow, step-by-step recipes ranging from Cherry Vanilla Bread, to Pineapple Banana Granola, to Linguine with Mock White Clam Sauce, to Tomatoes Stuffed with Italian Pork Sausage and Rice, to Thai Yellow Curry with Eggplant and Sweet Potato, to Blueberry Peach Mint Fruit Salad, The Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook will prove one of the most popular additions to any cookbook collection in general, and the kitchens of food allergy sufferers in particular."
5,Great for Holiday Meals!,"I got this book last week and have already made the Sweet Potato Cranberry Muffins for my daughter's class party, and the Coconut Squares for my work party. They were both delicious. My daughter and I do not eat wheat, dairy, or anything made with cane sugar, so these were great to have. The Coconut Squares were a little too sweet for me, but other people loved them.I also made the Beer-Battered Chicken Nuggets for my daughter's lunch last week. She loved them. And I was happy to find out that Corona is not made from wheat! (so I finished it off) I find the shopping list and brand list very helpful. I look forward to trying out the Shepard's Pie and the Porcini Risotto. I'll post another review after I try them."
3,Not the best kid-friendly cookbook,"My 7 yr old son is the one who suffers from food allergies in our family. He is allergic to eggs, dairy, soy, tree nuts and wheat. This was the first cookbook I purchased. I rarely use it now that I have acquired 3 other cookbooks. The recipes are more for adults and there are a lot of ingredients, some of which I have trouble finding. Plus, the flours used are a mixture of oat flour and barley. If you have a wheat allergy, you know to stay away from barley. Again, it is a good cookbook. Just not right for us!!"
4,"Fast, easy, compact desktop printer",fast little printer with exceptionally clean and crisp prints--none of those dotty textures or lined gray-scale problems typical with black and white. the toner cartridge that comes with the printer is also fairly high-volume as we've gotten thousands of pages so far without the need for replacement. solid choice if you only need black and white vanilla-type business printing.
3,gritty revenge,"I think l was hoping for a little more from this book. I felt it didn't live up to its cover expectations. It's a fairly interesting story of how a non-confrontational man, John, who has an odd relationship with his wife deals with the return of the bully from his childhood. The bully, Red, also happens to have had a relationship with John's wife. It's a case of David fighting back Goliath, which, more or less, achieves it's aim."
1,TORTURE,"I tried to force my way through this book, but I couldn't do it. Perhaps this work lost something vital in translation, but I found it dry and academic, lacking flow...the sort of thing about which Solomon said, ""Of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh."" I don't give up easily, but when I asked myself ""What does this paragraph mean? What is he trying to say?"" for the 50th time, the answer was ""I DON'T CARE ANYMORE!"" Maybe I'll try again later, but life is short... The one thing I did get out of this book: Barth also gave up on the so-called ""theology"" of his age and did what all of us ought to do: GO BACK TO THE BIBLE."
3,"Good, but I liked the movie better :)","According to Wikipedia, Jennings wrote this book based on a film treatment he had sold, which was made into a movie with the same name, starring John Wayne. That happens to be one of my favorite movies, I've watched it many times and the book follows the movie pretty closely (or vice versa).Also on wikipedia it says the book ""caused a lot of controversy among publishers due to its glimmers of homoeroticism"". I'd say those few glimmers are the main things that pop out as not being in the movie. And they aren't major things, just glimmers, like the article says.If you are a big fan of the movie, you'll probably enjoy reading the book too."
1,ted,A true sleeper. I usually find most things rated 5-star to be worthwhile. Disregard the reommendations of the previous reviewers. Unless you have insomnia. Then buy this DVD - you'll sleep soundly the whole night through.
5,An excellent contemporary novel.,"The Wednesday Girl is an excellent novel. It is very down to earth and filled with emotion. The author does a tremendous job of telling this story in a very descriptive and metaphorical, yet extremely readable way. I think almost everyone can relate in one way or another to the struggles and successes of the main character (Paige). It deals with emotions and situations everyone is very familiar with. Paige deals with career choice and what the author says is the ""driving force behind nature"" - sex. I strongly recommend this book to virtually anyone. I hope that this self-published novel reaches as many eyes as it deserves!"
3,"Not bad, but pricey","Tried this in my never ending search for a great conditioner for fine, curly, long hair in desert. Not bad, but trying to find something that either works better or at least works the same without the expense."
2,Just didn't work for me,"Was quite dissapointed in this product. My friend told me it was wonderful and I have read many great reviews on here so I didn't hesitate to purchase. After using it for about a month my hair is nothing but split ends! Quite dissapointed. I have such a hard time finding good products for my hair, so far I have found Bumble & Bumble, & Pureology - I keep looking for others out there but no luck so far!"
4,Good on black hair too,"I am black-caribbean with mostly 3c hair. I bought this conditioner over a year ago and hadn't noticed, when I bought it, that it was not a deep conditioner so when I used it I was initially disappointed. Eventually, wanting to find a use for it, I used it when I washed my hair for a second time in the same week and didn't need a DC. It worked wonderfully that day and ever since as a cowash conditioner. Sometimes I just also put it on at the end of my regular routine with DC and cuticle sealer so as to get its nice silky results as the last touch. Now I really like this for these uses and will repurchase this or experient with another alterna and then go back to this. I quite like it now. I'd bought the 33 oz as my first purchase and its almost gone. If the price doesn't bother you then start with a smaller size and see if it works on your hair as a light, but effective, conditioner."
2,Slow and unsafe,"It took a considerable amount of time to receive this CD AND it was shipped in a thin plastic wrapping without any padding. What I was charged for shipping a padded envelope would have been better. Luckily, it plays well."
1,sting's worst,"very hard to listen to...ponderous elevator music. get ""nothing like the sun"" or ""the dream of the blue turtles"" instead."
3,Solidly Sting,"Among the standout tracks on this 1996 effort are the poignant ""Hounds of Winter"" and ""I Hung My Head""; the uplifting ""I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying"", the sumptuous bossa nova of ""La Belle Dame Sans Regrets"", and the sweet, folky offerings ""I Was Brought To My Senses"", and ""Valparaiso"". Yet, too much of the album is burdened by filler (""All Four Seasons"" veers dangerously close to ballad banality). Still, this is a solid effort that ably showcases Sting's gifts as a lyricist and composer."
5,worth a second listen,"I grew up on the Police, and got hooked on Sting in college, but this is one of those albums I bought, listened to once, and popped into a dusty corner of my bookcase.Maybe I just wasn't ready for it yet, but a couple years later, a friend of mine insisted I give it another listen. I couldn't believe what incredible music had been gathering dust in my bookshelf for two years.This CD is easily one of my favorites now. ""I was Brought to My Senses"" is Sting's best song since his days with the Police, and the rest of the album is sad and achingly beautiful. I just wish he had somehow released ""Ghost Story"" from Brand New Day on this album in place of ""Let Your Soul..."" -- the only song I skip on the entire CD.If you didn't like it at first, wait until a melancholy winter day and try it again. It may not cheer you up, but it'll make being sad seem worthwhile."
3,Step down from Ten S. Tales.,The minority of tunes on are great! The majority is all too obvious filler. A bizarre observation is many of the extra tunes on his CD singles of this period where far better songs then what was included on the album. Pirate's Bride for example...There are others...
4,"good, but he's done better","Probably only for the true Sting fan as a must have. Some good tunes scattered, but the true gem of the album is track 4; ""Brought to my Senses"". It feels like the song should have been on ""Nothing like the Sun"", which was his best to date."
3,He can do better things if he wants to.,"Though most (not all) of the music I like is on the ""Indie"" or ""Not-totally-commercial-and-beyond"" side, I must admit I respect Sting, because he has a great tallent. He has shown that with Police, and even in his early records. But then he, like other excellent artists and bands, has discovered that his name could sell millions of records. Instead of doing like Peter Gabriel or Beck (who keep their own artistic identity despite their commercial fame), Sting decided that he could do lazy records. His experiments with Godspell Irish influences and country, among others fail a lot; they do not had the shine of past years. This is not a totally bad record, but Sting is tallented enough to create better things."
4,One of my favorites,"I grew up listening to, and loving, sting's music. When this cd came out I was a kid, But my dad always had it. I recently found it and it's been in my cd player non-stop since. Its a gorgeously crafted CD, one of my favorites. The only reason I don't give it 5/5 stars is because Lithium sunset is not a very strong song for this CD. Buy it, you won't be disapointed."
4,Pleasant temperature,"This has a fairly bad rap. It does center around mid-tempo numbers that may not immediately jump out, but also contains some of his best cultural dabblings to date. It is Sting doing what Sting does best, essentially."
5,Sting Rules!,I was surprised by all the songs I have forgotten that Sting has- this is a great album- can't go wrong with Sting!
3,Sting - MERCURY FALLING (1996),"Sting followed up the superb TEN SUMMONER'S TALES with MERCURY FALLING, on which the former Police frontman experiments with blues, country, folk, and a little bit of gospel. The album's biggest problem is a lack of energy. Part of the charm of Sting's earlier releases was the power of his songs and the passion in his vocals. Most of the songs on MERCURY FALLING are devoid of much energy, resulting in an unexciting, often pretentious album. It does have its highlights, namely the bluesy ""All Four Seasons"" and the uptempo ""Twenty Five To Midnight"", the latter of which was inexplicably omitted from the US and Canadian releases of the album; also, the emotional ""You Still Touch Me"" and the gospel-influenced ""Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot"". It's far from a bad album, but in the end it feels like Sting doesn't have his heart in it, resulting in an enjoyable, but unextraodinary recording."
1,"Not a bad album...but for Sting, it's awful","Sting's first 3 albums were all amazing collections of well-written music with great production. His 4th, ""Ten Summoners Tales"" was still a catchy, if rather pedestrian album. Clearly aiming at the top 40 charts. This one, ""Mercury Falling"" (read - interest falling), is an attempt to cash in on ""Summoners..."" success...it sounds forced. Nothing memorable here. Sting sounds bored. The only good thing I can say about it is that the production values are still high, but if the songs aren't there, what's the point? Total lackluster.It seems that el-Stingo wrote best when he was going thru emotional crises of some sort. Now he's rich & contented, and obviously trying to remain that way by cashing in on his sucess & prostituting his writing skills. Maybe he should write only when truly inspired so he's not wasting his time (or ours).After a truly DULL concert on the ""Summoners"" tour and then this album, I've lost my faith..."
2,I've only listened to it twice,"Now Sting is one of my favorite singers and I've worn most of his CD's and tapes out. But this piece of mess was so bad, I've only listened to it twice. I've given it 2 stars because I like ""Brought to my Senses"" and ""When We Dance"" (which sounds a LOT like ""They Dance Alone/Ceuca Solo""). Otherwise, the rest of the songs are completely unmemorable. Really, I can't remember any other songs on the CD. I've half a mind to use the CD as a coaster."
4,Mercury Falling,"Mercury Falling~ Sting is a very slick and well done production that sounds a bit like pop music for the ""Hugo Boss"" wearing and gin and tonic drinking crowd since it sounds so controlled and dubonair. I think that he is a vert tallented muisician and vocalist that sometimes plays it a bit to safe and does not experiment as much as he did in his earlier days. It is like he has become as predictable as a product from Colgate Palmolive and he does not want to scare his ""loyal"" customer so he plays the same kind of music from album to album with slight changes. The book-let is very nice and the font is easy on the eye and the photographs for the cover and inside the book-let are astounding. Even so it is a well produced (if predictable) album that I give four out of 5 stars."
4,other great job,"Grat job from Sting, paticulary when one artist made one song like the faboulous "" La Belle Dame Sans Regrets "" the album couldn't bad. Thanks Sting for this song and God bless to Kenny Kirkland for his solo piano."
3,Some wonderful songs...,"Yes, Sting does excel himself on most of these songs, but on others he sounds terrible - like he has thrown a jam-track in the studio onto the album to fill space. (Witness ""Valparaiso"".) But songs like The Hounds of Winter will make you glad you bought this CD nonetheless."
4,"I agree, not at his best...","but still, being Sting, he's better than about 90 percent of the artists out there. I think my favorite would have to be ""La Belle Dame Sans Regret"", which shows flashes of his clever self (more easily heard in ""Ten Summoner's Tales""). If you only buy one Sting album, let it be Ten Summoner's Tales, and if you buy two, get Tales and the Best Of collection...but I have this one as my third, and I like it a lot."
3,Sting not at his best,"Slow and somewhat passionless at times, Mercury Falling is a mixed bag of picks and pans. His renditions of the country/ western genre come out sounding pale and odd beside the lyrical sea chanty 'Valparaiso', while a couple other tunes fall short of masterpieces. On the whole, I bought this cd because I like Sting, it's not as good as Ten Summoner's Tales or as soulful and dark as The Soul Cages."
3,Could have been better (least good Sting's CD),"If you've never bought a Sting's CD before don't buy this one first ! Ten Summners Tales, ... Nothing Like The Sun and Brand New Day are his best. For a more quiet one The Soul Cages, is his best one, it talks about love, death and the sea. As a Sting fan, I admit I consider this CD to be Sting's worst one. It's not that it's totaly bad, it does have some good songs, but at the bottom, it's less good. The good tracks are : (1) The Hounds Of Winter; (4) I Was Brought To My Sences; (7) All Four Seasons; (8) Twenty Five To Midnight; THE GREAT (9) La Belle Dame Sans Regrets. That's about it. After all said.... DO enjoy yourselves !"
4,What's on it,This DVD contains four episodesDead Man's Hills (3/16/52)The Knockout (12/28/52)Money To Burn (6/28/53)Sheriff Missing (3/17/56)
4,A Very Sweet Movie,This is a very sweet and nostalgic movie with alot of the Red Skelton charm. It is funny at times and touching at others. Virginia O'Brien is excellent. Her character is alot more serious and sober than most of the roles she played. She proves she can hold your attention with out singing a note. The interaction between Red and Virginia is very sincere & poignant. It is a nice movie if you are a sentementalist like me.
5,Love the Treks - Love the Color Photos,"I love to backpack in the Sierras and Trinity Alps and am happy to say this guide is most helpful. It is full of organized details and helpful information for the serious backpacker. The color photos are a plus. I have been to many of these places as part of shorter trips as well, and they are as gorgeous as the book describes."
3,Nice but inadequate,"This is a very well-made book stand, but it doesn't hold any heavy or large-format book (except the lightest) without tipping. I suppose if I screwed it to a pedestal or table, it would be great. If you're looking for something nice for your paperback cookbooks, this is it. Otherwise..."
5,Great for easy reference-seeking.,I wanted something that would make it easy to look up references and/or other things like movie reviews. This book stand is just great; it swivels and fits nicely on my desk. It is well made and finished beautifully. I highly recommend it to other people who like to use books on a regular basis.
3,Ten Summoner's Tales,"My purchase arrived pretty quickly. I was happy with the purchase, however, the first track had a skip on it upon immediately putting it in the CD player. This is the 2nd CD I have purchased online that has had a skip. Not sure if this is common or not, but considering the care I take with CDs, to me it is like ordering a painting with a fingerprint stain on it. But the rest of the CD played perfectly, and I suppose for the price, I should just deal with it."
4,Sting's fourth solo album,"The ex-Policeman's fourth solo album should been entitled 11 Summoner's Tales since there are eleven tracks. The 11th and final track is entitled EPILOGUE(DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ME). This album was released a decade after the Police's last all-original album SYNCHRONICITY which was a megahit. Hits include IF I EVER LOSE MY FAITH IN YOU,FIELDS OF GOLD,SHAPE OF MY HEART,IT'S PROBABLY ME and EPILOGUE. Sting's first two albums,THE DREAM OF THE BLUE TURTLES and NOTHING LIKE THE SUN were megahits. 1991's THE SOUL CAGES wasn't so great. Sting's 3rd megahit was this album. All the other songs are good."
2,I don't like the direction Sting has taken.,"This is one of Sting's most popular albums. It introduced him to a whole new audience of pop fans.I don't like the direction Sting has taken. He used to be a very innovative musician, experimenting with jazz, blues, raggae and other styles of music. Here he is just a straight ahead pop singer. I find most of the tunes just boring. They are white bread songs written for the masses.What I find really bad about this album is the high pitched chromatic harmonica that is used throughout almost all of the songs. To me, the sound it puts out is annoyning and unpleasant.There are two songs I like on this CD, but they are not the hits. If you like the song Shape of My Heart or any of Sting's recent material, then you will love the whole album. If you think Sting was good when he was with the Police, or during his jazz stage (Dream of the Blue Turtles), or rock stage (Demolition Man) you probably will be disappointed with this."
1,Imposible to watch,"This DTS Edition is not possible to see in any of my DVD players or Home Theatre......, its a shame but I feel like I waste my money here....Be sure before u purchase this kind of products that your stuff at home are ready for these technology...."
5,Sting at his finest!,"This is the best Sting CD there is, with the possible exception of his ""best of"" collection. Besides the wonderful and well-known ""If I Ever Lose My Faith in You"" and ""Fields of Gold"", there are gems like the darker, but incredibly clever ""Saint Augustine in Hell"" and the wistful but witty ""Seven Days"". It's so hard to find a funny philosopher like Sting in pop music - his songs are totally fresh and fun. Great lyrics, great tunes. Buy it!!!"
1,DTS mixing no good,"The single review here that says this DTS disc sounds like Prologic is right. The mixing is bad. The sound is thin. If you are a Sting fan, buy the stereo CD instead."
3,"DTS version ""Close, but no cigar!""","First: This is a review of the DTS mix, not the content! I'm a big Sting fan and the songs are great! I must say, I received this cd/dvd with much anticipation of how well it was going to sound in DTS 5.1. I was dissapointed! The mix by Martin Pradler left me wondering, ""What's the point of 5.1 if you use the rear channels unevenly"". Obviously, any multichannel mix sounds better than stereo so, it appears to sound better. This cd actually sounds muffled and flat. Instead of a ""Surround"" sound you get a, somewhat annoying, smattering of sounds from the rear channels like Dolby ProLogic. Maybe, Hugh Padgham should do DTS 5.1 mixing."
3,From An Avowed Sting Fan,"Although one of his commercially most succesful disc, it's my least favorite. And that's in spite of my love for ""Shape of My Heart"" and ""It's Probably Me"". Yet, I detest ""Fields of Gold"" and ""If I Ever Lose My Faith in You"". I will, however, always keep this disc and not trade it in - dunno, there's something scary about willingly giving up a Sting album."
5,No wonder he's where he is today,"A great album (than again u knew that already). Stings versatility and vibrance is proven in this album. I would consider this his ""transition"" album where he moved away from his cool, blues, jazzy style to more of a pop-ish, funky style.As always, his songs are deep if not dark (like track 2: Love Is Stronger Than Justice where one of the brothers kills his other 6 brothers) and what impressed me is the wide scope that this album experiments with. Definitely a must have. My favs were 7 days and the last song 'nothing about me"
5,Lot of Artistic Spirit,"Tracks 8,9 and 10 are my favorites and I call this trio of songs the Sting Suite (thought the songs don't actually connect)...To me they represent what makes Sting one of the most gifted music writers, vocalists and performers of our time or generation. The man proves you need no flash or bombastic production numbers to prove your artistic worth. These tunes alone in their minimalist simplicity and intelligent lyrics of the soul speak in volumes.As for the rest of the cd, the other tracks are incredible. There really is no way to categorize his music, nor do I want to ( Sting probably doesn't either).My other recommendation is to also purchase the full surround sound DTS version of this timeless recording (providing your player and or receiver have the DTS chip to decode the channels). It's simply a must have for any true music and eclectic avid collector's library..."
2,Unbelievable,"I skimmed through the book in a bookstore. What's unbelievalbe is that Appendix A of the book contains complete listing of exported functions from Windows 95 (yes 95) KERNEL32.DLL, in about 20 pages.Come on, this is year 2001, not 1995 or 1996."
1,Don't buy this book,"The final chapter of this book describes a program that is supposed to work like the Windows command-line interpreter. When I compiled the example, I got page after page of warnings. I renamed all the source files to .cpp and recompiled and now I got several errors; for example, passing the address of the address of a string, when the function was expecting just the address. After fixing all errors and warnings, I ran the program and gave it the name of another program to invoke. It promptly stopped in the debugger. The wrong function was being called to release a handle.In order to review the code, I removed the CD rom. So I can't return the book. But it was a waste of money."
4,Madonna Mia this is good stuff!,"Fuhgheddaboutit is THE book for MobStar fans. I call myself a MobStar. What is it you may ask? Well, it's an actor who excels in Mafia roles. I'm an actor who has been trying to get on The Sopranos since it came on TV. I'm told I'm a DEAD RINGER. This book is great for Soprano fans and fans of those MobStars on the show shouldn't despute that this book is right on target. Learn to talk the talk and walk the walk or you ain't a true MobStar."
1,I'm not sure about this book................,I'm not sure that I understand this book. What is it about? Is it funny? A co-worker showed me this book because he knows I like humor books that are new and that I like reviewing them. I wonder if there is a market out there for this book. I would be interested in knowing what other people think because I am still trying to analyze what it is I missed about this book. How do books like this get written? We need real humor out there. (Not this ethnic slur humor.) Someone - write something funny!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,I came here from TVTropes as well.,"It's Gary Larson so it's wonderful, although slightly redundant given the existence of ""The Complete Far Side 1980-1994"", which is admittedly a lot more expensive. Also, doesn't the lady's head look odd? On the cover."
5,Very good,Kingston memory has always served me well. Increasing the memory & performance on my computer was quite sucessful with this Kingston memory. It is a great product at an affordable price.
1,2nd Hand Product from a 2nd Hand Company,"I ordered this product (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008XOKU/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title), and didn't get it. I ordered a product manufactured by KINGSTON TECHNOLOGIES. What I GOT was a second hand product manufactured by ""Komputerbay"", whomever they are. But the memory sticks didn't work or improve performance of the PC they were installed in. This was completely a case of ""bait and switch"" in my book, and I thought was illegal. It is COMPLETELY unappreciated, and wrong. I'm returning the fakes I was sent, and hope somehow that some reputable company will send me the products that I want, and trust."
4,It works fine !!!,"It works when I installed in the computer, it recognizes when I power up the computer, but I do not know how long it will last because it is an electronic stuffs."
2,Motorized Head Massager,"My wife liked this scalp massager and found it relaxing, but didn't imagine using it on a regular basis. I am starting to bald slightly and found the tips of the massager painful. They poked my head and actually hurt. I will not use this again. The tips need rubber or silicon on them."
1,Bad Company,When I received the item it was already opened and this was suppose to be an xmas gift. I contacted the company and they said they would send me another one and never did. I will NEVER DO BUSINESS with these guys again.
2,Not that great,"I bought this andBody Back Company Scalp Massagerat the same time to see whether the motorized version was better, and if so how much. This motorized head massager has much sturdier prongs and a strong little motor, so much so that it wasn't relaxing. More irritating, and slightly painful. I couldn't make it comfortable.Thesimple version, on the other hand, was /great/. And only $4 at the time of this review. My advice? Save $16 and buy the simple version. Endless, cheap, source of relaxation for the price of a good mocha. If you really want to spend $20 on a head massager don't repeat my mistake. Buy 5 of theother oneinstead. You can keep two spares and still make two new friends out of the deal by giving the others away ;)"
2,scalp massager,It could be great if it was made sturdier. The tip of one of the prongs that massages the scalp came off a few days after use making it impossible to use because it is all metal and sharp and will injure the scalp and the whole portion that fits into the handle falls out constantly so you have to keep reinserting it in order to use it.
4,GREAT Product,"I purchased this present for my dad for Christmas. He was telling me how cool he thought the head massagers were. Then I saw a motorized one, and HAD to get it. My dad really loved it. It feels pretty good too."
2,This thing kind of hurts. Pass on this particular one.,I purchased a ten pack of cheaper manual head neck scalp massagers as well as this motorized one. The cheap ten pack ones worked great and send chills down your spine and feel good. This motorized one does not feel good at all. The times are very stiff and kind of dig in real quickly. Not a very pleasant experience. The vibration does not help. The unpowered manual ones (with soft times) do just fine and are much better in comparison.
3,It's ok,"Bought for my husband, but we both like the non motorized ones better. This one was too rough on the head"
3,Motorized Head Massager,"An ok product, but I guess I could have done without it. I barely use it. I get a bit tingling sensation on the head, but it is more irritating than relaxing. At least it was cheap!!! No bit loss here."
2,Poorly Constructed,"The batteries that came with the product didn't work, they didn't fit and damaged the battery encasement. The use of AAA batteries allowed me to operate the product but the batteries become displaced after a few minutes of operation. The batteries that came with the product resemble AA but are not actually AA because I tried them in my TV remote and they didn't fit. If the product actually worked for more than 2 minutes at a time with a standard type of battery it would be a decent product but as it stands it was just a waste of money. . Unfortunately, it's too late to return it because the packaging went out with recycling yesterday."
3,"Noisy, but works and includes 2 AA batteries.","It gets the job done, but it is rather noisy. The plastic leg tips are plastic balls 2mm in diameter. The legs themselves are coated in a thin coat of oil to preserve them I am guessing, but that is easy to wipe off. The handle is easy to hold in either the left or right hand. The legs are easy to rotate (fan-out).I attempted to dampen the noise internally by removing the two screws in the battery area, then removing the four mounting screws about mid-way. I used strips of an old wash cloth to wrap around the inside; however, the noise persisted. It could be motor noise. If anyone found a solution, please let me know."
5,Simply wonderful!,"I love this thing! It sends tickly shivers up and down my scalp, relaxing my neck and shoulders when they get too tense. I've even had good luck using it to shorten the duration of my migrane headaches. I'm planning on buying another to stash away - I don't want to discover it's no longer made if mine ever breaks."
4,It's great! but isn't the best one,"I'm agree with almost all the reviews here but I had used the copper one and feels better, because is softer and more relaxing sensation."
2,Sounded like a great idea,I thought that this would be an amazing product. I had tried one at a party that was non motorized and I wish I would've saved my money from this purchase. The motor is too strong and it feels like a jack hammer on top of your head and the 'arms' are so stiff quite honestly- it just plain hurts. I now will be spending extra $$ to get the plain old fashioned $2 non motorized version.
5,Great product,"We had a ground hog chew a hole in our lawnmowers gas tank. The tank costs about $60.00 to replace. I saw this on amazon and decided to give it a try. This sure was a great alternative to keep from having to buy a new gas tank.Just cut off a small amount to cover the hole, mend/need it and place it over the hole. It hardened fast & fixed my problem."
3,Interesting read,Professor Mitchell seems to overread Tocqueville. One does learn a great deal about Tocqueville. One also learns a great deal about Professor Mitchell's passionate views. His work is really a work about political theology rather than political philosophy. Professor Mitchell sees a third path to prevent the leveling that he perceives as a result of equality working its way out historically.
3,Pacific Northwest,Vendor was great...book OK . Not what I expected from a William Sonoma book. I would not recommend this series.
3,"Content 4, audio quality 2.","You can certainly hear these recordings ok, they're perfectly functional. However, the sound isn't nearly as sharp or as clear as even the average book-on-cassette-tape.In terms of what Mr. Swain says, the recordings (which I suspect are a repackaging of a set of tapes he has previously released) are first rate. In the very crowded field of learning to write fiction, Mr. Swain's work (particularly ""Techniques of the Selling Writer"") has held up for years. His advice is specific and useable and there is a lot of it. So much so that these cds bear repeated plays. The set is strong enough to stand alone but also makes an excellent companion to Swain's other work on writing."
5,Dog loves it too,I buy it for her teeth but she prefers it over any other kibble. Less expensive than the prescription kind but very similar to it.
4,Great brand. Great product.,My dog loves it. Helps with dental hygiene as well as digestion. The only problem is with the size of each pellet. They seem to be a little too big for my dog (Bichon-Poo 14 lb dog) and I need to break each pellet into two and then the dog will happily eat it. And breaking these pellets is not an easy task. They are really hard and use a mortar -pestle from my kitchen to get the job done !
3,Interesting,"You know, i have been into trance for a while now. I have listened to a lot of different DJs and come to expect certain things from each one. While im not saying that this is a bad album or anything, its definately not what i have come to expect from Ferry Corsten. This first disc kinda sounds like to Mack trucks full of samples collided head on. When i was expecting decent trance music, all disc one delivered was a ""by the book"" techno experience. Its incredibly mellow (alittle too much for this reviewers taste), and doesnt really pick up until the last few tracks. Not too bad of a disc overall, just not what i saw coming. Disc 2 delivers alittle bit more on the trance end, quenching my thirst for Ferry Corsten's trance talent. Maybe its because the Ferry Corsten i have grown to love is the one i hear mainly in his ""trance energy"" live sets, but this album is not even close to what i was expecting."
3,stung,"If you like to like Sting this is probably good for you. Nothing that spectacular to me, but it's mixed very well."
5,T and stevie,"This is an older ""album?"" that I got when I did some work for Passport Records years ago as a cassette( remember those?) It's a great set of music that clearly shows T/ Lavitz's contact with that Dregs outfit and more to the point with that Steve Morse fellow. Why Morse even has the nerve to muscle in on ""Sparkle Plenty"", one of the best hooks in a song ever. And Damn if the whole cd isn't worth searching out anyway you can .So stop reading and get the damn thing already."
3,Not Their Best,"This was the Little sisters' first book and, unfortunately, it shows. The characters are cardboard and the killer seems entirely random. Their second novel, The Black-Headed Pins, is a much better showcase for their screwball humor and mystery."
2,Picks up lint,I thought this would be a good deal but the material for this set picks up dust and lint way too easily. Other wise it looks ok and didn't fade in the wash.
4,$12.99 is a great price,I need a tablecloth and this was the cheapest price PLUS 6 napkins. Both packets arrived dirty with many hanging threads and I threw them straight into the washer. They are 55% cotton and 45% polyster so they came out of the dryer wrinkle free. I am very happy with these basic table linens. I like the price too.Made in Pakistan
1,sent wrong item for the second time,"Once again Amazon sent me the tablecloth only, no napkins. This is the second time. I don't need anymore tablecloths. I need napkins"
4,Very good approach to this amazing love,"I have to admit, it's a great book, he takes a very interesting and intellectual approach which I really appreciated. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone that is just trying to find their way of faith in todays world or already has a close relationship with God, or especially for people who are still far away from him, I think its a great book to show to skeptics the true love of God, who is love himself."
2,Skinamax,This is a softcore video. No real confessions. Just porn stars having fake sex. Several different scenes & some of the girls had their websites up for your perusal. This is nothing more than you'll see on Skinamax.
5,"it's an experience,a journey,words cannot describe this book","I have recommended this book to anyone I know that is on a path of awakening and can hear the words with their heart.I have given this book as gifts numerous times, but I cannot find it anymore which greatly saddens me. I would love to turn the world on to this book as it so beautifully depicts our Native Americans - OUR indigenous people. This book does justice to out Native Americans which they so very much deserve. I do not know how to thank Steve Wall and Harvey Arden - they have touched my life with this richly textured, genuine and moving piece. No words can express the power behind the span of the eagle's wings, the moving wisdom of a redwood forest or the joy inside to which this book has brought me."
5,Wisdom,"She:Kon (Sago)(Hello) To all who read this and hope you are all well. I personally know some of the Wisdom Keepers, Elders whose words are in this book and know them to be of good mind and person. I am Mohawk and Odawa and I come from upstate New York near some of the Reservations and I fully recommend this book for any person who needs to come back to the reality of the living world around them and bring them back to the basic relation between humankind and all the life that is on this earth and surrounds us in the cosmos."
3,Slow journey,Any of Clutchs music does not jump out and grab you. It has a smokey vibe that they roll up and light and blow it into your face. You know where they stand when you listen to this album and band
1,Ugh. This is really horrible.,A friend gave me this CD because he got it for free and hated it. I also hated it and threw it away. I think my friend is a total jerk for giving me crap like this. I guess this would be okay if you drive a Camero and wear a backwards baseball hat and a shell necklace. This type of music is a cultural dead-end.
5,5 stars as always,"Clutch is one of the absolute best bands ever, and this disc demonstrates that just as well as all the others. I saw someone on here described them as the Grateful Dead of distortion, and that's very fitting. They are in continuous evolution, and it might take two listenings to wrap your mind around the latest sound.B."
1,Misleading,I thought this was a Kindle book and have no use for this. It is nothing I would be interested in. I should have read the small print.
1,What a disappointment,"Recently I realized how often I listened to Bent's first album, so I bought Everlasting Blink. What a disappointment, gone were the sensuous vocals, cool riffs, and vibey flow of the first album. I just think Everlasting Blink is a bit of a bore, nothing jumped out at me, sounded very much like generic electronica muzak. Bummer!"
4,'thick ear' - the irony!,"while i agree with most of the comments others made about this album, the near-universal dislike of the circus-like atmosphere of the closer, ""thick ear,"" strikes me as quite hilarious. perhaps the tune is aptly named, as doctors bent likely understood, while brilliant as the track is, that genius would more times than not fall of deaf ears. seems to me that some folks need to visit the ""music therapy"" wing of ""the bent home for the tediously sane,"" as advertised on their website."
2,Tedious and self-aggrandizing,"I see that other reviewers have been impressed by this memoir, but I found it lacking on several fronts. The tedious details of hardships and battles failed to engage me. The author's poorly veiled pride in her many sexual exploits (for example with ""her Pierre"") seem to me unnecessary and in bad taste. I rolled my eyes at her failure to accept any responsibility for her own situation during the trial of being left with two ""demanding"" children (I think she called her sons this three times within two pages) and domestic help. Her many recollections of being warmly welcomed and sought after all over the world, as well as constant name dropping, reveal the author's humility as false.I didn't enjoy this memoir and wouldn't recommend it to others unless they have a special interest in WWII or the Foreign Legion."
4,What a life!,"I bought this book after reading the review in Time magazine. Susan Travers is English, lived a life of privilege in Southern France in the 1930s and moved on to participate firsthand in one of World War II's renowned battles. This is the story of a woman 50 years ahead of her time. There is adventure and love, all ultimately heartbreaking but fascinating to read about.Susan Travers finally becomes the first, and only, woman to join the foreign legion, and she steps aside, letting the love of her life become a successful politician/statesman.She is now more than 90 years old, and has waited for all those whose feelings might have been hurt by the story to have died: her husband, the colonel, the colonel's wife... She tells the story now, she says, for her grandchildren."
4,Nostalgia,I remember reading several of these Endworld Doubles when I was a teenager living in Texas. Gotta get them again.
3,tribute to the old skool,"old skool rhymes by special ed, rakim, and mc lyte are evident here not a bad song but for serious missy ansd timbaland fans only."
3,Collectors Only in my humble opinion,"Consider this: 66 pages, priced at $2.00 in 1967, all black and white except for the inside and outside of the cover which is Paper(in color). Good illustrations, not great...just good. I own this as a novelty, because I enjoy having as many books on this subject as I can find. I do not hold it in high esteem as a great resource for french beading...it is only filling a time line for this floral beading junkie. If you have money to burn buy it! If you don't, then look for something more durable, more comprehensive, and better priced."
4,Very good,"Quality power-metal, but definitely not their best. Devil in the Tower is a real gem though. If you like Dark Moor, you'll probably get it."
4,Pretty solid power metal,"This is pretty good. Some of the songs are pretty repetitive, especially the keyboard parts. The Devil in the Tower is an awesome exception to this rule however. Some of the singing parts also sound a little rushed, like they were cramming too many words in a particular line. The most obvious example is on the Chariot, in the chorus.Overall, a good album to get if you have every really good power metal album already."
4,dark moor,nice album. too bad not many people have heard about this band here in the USA.favorite track #10. moon modern instrumental interpretation of beethoveen symphony #3 and moon sonata
5,A GREAT CD WITH A VARIETY OF MUSIC!!!,I bought this Cd after seeing the movie and absolutely loving the music!! The songs by Blues Traveler and Colin James and the Little Big Band are so fun and great songs to sing along with or dance to. The best part of the soundtrack are the classic songs by Todd Rundgren and The Tramps. You can't get any better than Disco Inferno!!!
4,Excellent CD,"One of the best movie soundtracks of all time, if you liked the movie as much as I did you will love the feelings the music gives you. Took off a star because it need ""Something in the Air"" by Thunderclap Newman, that song always reminds me of Kingpin."
5,"Great loser story that came out on top, sort of","Munson had everything going for him and more against him. He perservered and lost in the end, but ended up a winner in more ways than one. The Farrelly Brothers have an original style of comedy that really shows well in this movie.review 1, the song you are asking about is Simon and Garfunkel ""The Sounds of Silence"""
4,Kingpin soundtrack is a pleasant surprise.,"With the exception of Oh LA La La,etc. every song is great, especially Surely, I Love You. Very good easy listening tape and cute movie too."
1,"After the climax of BRULES, this one is totally anti-climax!","This one is a totally bore! Mr. Combs lost his focus and digress himself from a once great hero, and made him into a boring soldier. The whole book is unreadable and bore to death! Don't waste your time to read it, unless you are trying to get some boring historical study of the early stages of US military strategies of how they kill so many Indians! Just read the BRULES we all rated a big 10! After finish it, if you like it, absolutely don't try to read this sequel, it will totally ruin your wonderful taste"
1,A disappointment.,"Combs does not write in the usual fashion, not much plot, just the day to day ""log"" of the scout's activities. Not muchto look forward to and no real ending... it just stops."
4,Very Good!!!,"While The Scout is a fascinating account of the old west, what I found most compelling in this story was Brules's realationship with Milisande. The hard life of a woman with a husband that was away for long periods of time, in an extremely dangerous job. Her worries and fears, and how she made the best of it due to the great love and passion she had for her husband. I thought Combs's take on how Brules expressed his emotions and love for this woman was beautiful. While other readers have found it a bit slower than his first book, I truly enjoyed the pace."
4,A Glimpse Inside,"This series is very enjoyable. The mysteries are good, but the view of the culture in modern day China is even more compelling. Inspector Wang and his new bride travel back to the Inspector's home town to honor his father and he stumbles onto a murder. I am looking forward to new books in this series."
4,Lovely illustrations though some are too small,"I fell in love with Fushigi Yuugi back when it came to America over a decade ago and I was in my girly, shoujo manga phase. I picked this up out of nostalgia and a desire to own something of which I had only seen scans online. The illustrations by Yuu Watase are beautiful, colorful, and ethereal. The book is skinny though and a handful of pages have a number of very small pictures on them, almost thumbnails. I would have preferred more full page illustrations even if it meant paying a bit more. Since this is a translated version of the original 1995 Japanese publication, I realize that is not possible. There is some nice additional information like character bios, a timeline of the story, an interview with Ms. Watase, etc. The printing is lovely - vibrant with nice glossy pages. All in all, I'm happy with it but would've liked some of those tiny pictures to be bigger."
5,Ping pong poll table top,This is a nice sturdy pin pong table top that sits on my 7 foot pool table. It is well built and I am very happy with it. It comes in two sections which allows us to take it off relatively easily. The two pieces are a bit heavy and large for a single person to take off the pool table but this is not a big deal since you need two people to play ping pong anyway. The heavy table translates into a well put together table.
5,Threadbear,Wonderful book of healing for children. This story takes lost to found. Abandoned and hurt characters that find healing from a benevolent old man that not only provides physical care but meets emotional needs too. Threadbear is perfect for anyone who has experienced loss or abandonment.
1,A really dreadful guide to compact discs...,"This book is enthusiastic and full of cliches. It's an extremely odd view of jazz history, largely discounting white musicians and modern jazz in general. The standard guide is still published by Penguin, which is much more knowledgable and open-minded."
4,Bourdon Street Swinging!,"As noted in my other review of this CD, there are some good live sides of Sharkey Bonano, Armand Hug, Tony Parenti, and others. You especially catch the spirit and flavor of Sharkey in his excellent arrangements."
3,Repetitive ...,"It was great to have the band members themselves give their view of things, but there's little that couldn't be summed up in a couple of pages. Instead you get countless variations on a few themes: John Fogerty loves the blues, CCR worked hard with John in control, John is a vindictive jerk.It would have been nice to have heard from a broader range of people: childhood friends, early fans, etc."
5,Real good and Informative!,Highly recomend thid book. Complete with their good and bad times from when the were just starting and the solo career of John
2,The Holocaust of War Complex?,"The book was interesting as a study in writing style. The title of the book does not cover the military industrial establishment or tease out how real WWII combat vets feel about our current politico-military juggernaut. While reading I couldn't help but think this is an English Prof showing me how conscious she is of her own consciousness. Unfortunately the book is a big digresson about the holocaust and Adolf Eichman's role as person who was a functionary and organized the logistics of killing millions Jews. R.J. Lifton has already clearly described bureaucratic distancing from killing in modern techno-war. So what's new? The book does not contain any information about the current military industrial establishment and its influence on U.S, politics and the relationship to the war in Iraq if there is one. Go to a book store and read the brief conclusion."
5,Your Hunt is over. Collect it now...,"Coming of age in the 80's ususally meant that if you loved music, you most likely started out the decade by collecting cassettes. I just found this cassette--- a forgotten treasure amongst the hundreds I have had in storage. And now I'm finally buying the CD.Hunters and Collectors was an aquired taste at the time, and still is, but this album flat-out rocks. The music here stands outside of time, and sounds as though it could have been recorded (and released) yesterday. The intensity of it far outshines anything on current radio playlists, just as it did when it was released 18 years ago. Do yourself a favor and get this gritty album."
1,San Disk Digital Photo reader,"Poor quality, outdated technology. Do not buy. I tried it as it was listed for about $10. Those were totally wasted. With technology so much more advanced, there is no reason not to transfer your photos to/from computer and onto the appropriate media such as USB flash drive or SD card."
1,"Broken, incompatible, unreadable menus","I use a 512MB Sandisk CF card in my Canon S45 camera. I put several pictures on the card, of varying sizes and qualities. None of them displayed onscreen, and even the Preview option showed a sort of colored fuzzed-out picture instead of a thumbnail view. This is the biggest piece of junk I have ever used, thank goodness it was free. I wonder why, they're probably unloading them, or the free ones are all secretly 'refurbished' or something. Shame on Amazon."
4,Reunion,"At a recent family reunion where we all took pictures of the same scenes, we were able to plug in the Photo Viewer and enjoy each other's pictures. Another tourist at The Monterey Aquarium took several group photos of us. It was great to see them and choose the best (not easy with 17 subjects). The large size on the TV made selection much easier."
2,SanDisk SDV-1A Digital Photo Viewer,"I purchased and mailed this viewer to my dad so he could view pictures on his Sanyo TV, but after several attempts he couldn't get it to work. My dad called SanDisk and they said that the viewer would not work with his TV. ""His Sanyo Digital TV is only two years old""If you are interested in this model viewer you may want to check with SanDisk to see if it will work on your TV! Technical Support 1-866-726-3475 or [...]"
1,defective,"Error code for most of my working sd cardsOne it had me wait for an hour, but never recognized it. Now my computer won't either!"
2,Be Aware MS PRO users!,"I bought this photo viewer for my 1G Memory Stick Pro card, and just when it arrived that i noticed it does not read PRO MS. Nothing mentioned that it does not read PRO cards, and I assumed that it worked for all Memory Sticks...Now its useless for me. SanDisk should have explained that it was made for MS cards and not MS PRO! But its a nice viewer when used for all other memory cards."
1,Broken upon receipt,"Purchased unit to read compact flash. Upon failed operation, looked closer and saw broken pin in card area. Didn't note *any* resistance when the card was inserted, so it was either broken upon arrival or it bent when the card was slid in the slot with no resistance. In either case, the unit's far too fragile with compact flash cards and I had to make a return. Sad too, because it looked promising otherwise."
4,But do you need it?,"Interesting that the previous reviewer used this to view pictures taken on a Canon G3, while that camera, and many other cameras too, have the capability built in to view pictures on a television (NTSC or PAL). Also, these cameras allow you to view the videos you've taken too, whereas this device is limited to stills (JPEGs).So, although this gadget looks good, check your camera first - you might not need this.BTW: I gave this 4 stars based on the description (and because a rating is mandatory to submit a review) - I don't own one of these 'cos my Canon G2 connects to the TV just fine."
3,"Uses Memory Stick, but NOT Memory Stick PRO. ..","Recently bought the SanDisk SDV-1A Digital Photo Viewer because it seemed like a logical way to screen digital pictures without using the computer. Also could provide a nice slide show on the television for a group. Unfortunately I had also bought two SanDisk 256Meg Memory Stick Pro storage devices which I use with my Sony digital camera. The Memory Sticks (Pro) work well with the camera, but they do NOT work with the SanDisk SDV-1A Digital Photo Viewer. Wish I had known that before I purchased the viewer. Other than that, it peforms OK for the cost.Regards, Pag"
4,Ok but has some issues worth knowing about.,"I have heard these are being discontinued, but since they are still for sale I'll pass along some information. I have used one of these continously for a couple years, it has been very reliable.However it only works with FAT16 formatted SD memory. Important because of a limit of about 360 picture files that can be stored in a single folder/directory. A SDV-1A can't see subdirectories, so a 256mb or 512mb SD will only serve 360 files, my 360 pictures added up to 273MB, a 1gb SD still produced the same result. Second issue, larger (3200 X 2400+) jpegs won't display. It skips over them, along with some other smaller pics that I haven't guessed why yet. Still the SDV-1A is worth considering because as I understand it their new model doesn't have an s-video output port."
1,"As Death metal goes, pretty lame","I must say that these guys are pretty lame. What language are they speaking in? How come the bass is inaudible? Why must the double bass drumming suck so bad? I ask these questions and more.If you want good death metal, here are some choices:Brutal: Morbid Angel, Decapitated, Cannibal Corpse, Dying Fetus, Deicide, Vader, Death, Exhumed, Cryptopsy, Nile.Melodic: Rapture, Norther, Dimension Zero, Nightrage, In Flames, Kalmah, Extol, Borknagar, In Flames, Old Man's Child.Avoid this band!"
3,More for teens,"I'm not sure how this ties in with the first Petaybee trilogy. Sure, it is about the children born in the last book but it seems to be written for a much younger audience than before. The storyline is gungho children win out over the adults who can't manage without them. Not within the same lines of the previous trilogy but acceptable with a very large grain of salt."
4,New McAffrey Series,"From the two authors collaboration that brought forth the talking planet PTB, a second series is spinning into the ether. Children of the original ""changed"" inhabitants, are given the chance to explore the rest of the universe before their genetically modified bodies require then to stay home permanently. While not as detailed or mysterious as her dragon series, or intellectual either, it is a good read which can be used for a treat to children wanting to hear a bedtime space story."
3,Simplistic sequel,"I was disappointed by this book, because it seems less complex and exciting than the Power trilogy. Or maybe the novelty of Petaybee just wore off. I can only hope the boring nature of this book is because it sets the background for something exciting in its sequel."
3,Formulaic but compelling,"As an avid Anne McCaffrey reader I was fascinted by the whole Petaybee idea and was - of course!- interested to see what would develop after the twins birth. It's a compelling book but I did find it some-what formulaic and McCaffrey's usual originality a bit subdued. Still, a good purchase and I look forward to the next installment."
3,Not the same,Changelings: Book one of the Twins of Petaybee - Not as entertaining as the original books. Too predictable of a story line for me.
4,It was OK,"It was kind of... how do I say it, luke. Could have been a 6 stars out of 5 kind of book. If you know what I mean."
3,great fluff,"I love reading about the whole powers that be series and it has been awhile since I've read the books. This was a great book to read while snowed in for awhile and it was nice fluff. Nothing serious or horribly deep and thought provoking. However, it was a good book. I can hardly wait to read the next one because it ends in a bit of a cliffhanger."
1,What a Disappointment,"I received this book yesterday, a rainy day, and settled in my favourite chair with a cup of mint tea, for a nice afternoon of reading. Was I disappointed! 3-1/2 hours later I finished the book.The book has 270 pages. I had not read the 3 books preceeding it. I don't know who the characters on the cover are supposed to be - they certainly aren't the twin children, and their colouring and age don't match the description of the parents. The story was simple, with no complexity - for example, there was only one bad person - others were hinted at, but never appeared. And the otter was just plain silly - by the end of the book I was just skimming his ""dialog.""I am not familiar with Elizabeth Ann Scarborough, but I have read everything Anne McCaffrey has written. I expected more of McCaffery, especially since her name is listed first, than what I got.I recommend that you wait till this book is a $5.95 paperback, not a $19.95 hardback, before buying it. And don't expect much."
3,not a lot of substance,"This book has a few mini-stories of Italy during World War II -more of a novel than a history. The book was well-written enough to keep my attention and for me to be willing to finish it. On the other hand, the book was so skimpy and disorganized that I didn't feel like it amounted to a coherent story; I also didn't feel I had enough context to even appreciate the mini-stories."
4,Wonderful Slice of Life Down Under,"After watching this series on Ovation, and missing out on some of the lines because of the Aussie accent, it was fantastic to read the book. Tim Winton takes you back to a time when people were struggling to feed their families and to a place with some supernatural vibes. His contrast of characters in the story is enchanting, and he unfolds their stories with a believable yet entertaining plot. I'm glad I bought this book, and will read more of Winton in the future."
3,Cloud Street,"Another Australian novel that captures what Australians and their lifestyles were like in the past. Mr Winton writes well (there were some images I didn't get but they were clearly 'clever') and is really skilful in his use of plot and subplot. It's a really good and absorbing study of a wide variety of characters, the pluses and minuses of their lives and the challenges and joys of their lives."
4,very real,"I've heard this described as 'the great Australian novel'. While not sure I fully agree I certainly rate it very highly. The book evokes Australia very strongly and in great detail. As an expat Australian I felt somehow at home... each of the interesting and complex, yet wholly real and easily related to characters had elements of people I've known. The way it is written is very thoughtful and empathetic, yet the language manages to stay low key and (as other reviewers have noted) loaded with Aussie slang which made it fun to read.The storyline is engaging, sweeping and epic. I found myself rejoicing at the ups and frowning at the downs they experienced, and admiring the strength of just about all of them at one time or another. The only thing I didn't like was one or two of the plot turns. Rose's reconciliation with her mother seemed a little put on, for example. But it's the characters that made this story for me. On the whole, a very enjoyable read."
2,What is all the fuss about?,"I am sorry - I do not like it, I tried for 50% of the Kindle copy but found it too boring to be interested any longer. It has such a reputation as a good book, but I missed it - sorry and all that."
3,Reminded me of The Sullivans,This is a quirky book set in Perth during the first half of the 20th century. It revolves around the lives of two very ordinary families who lives accidentally become intwined. One family is beset by bad luck. What ever can go wrong will go wrong. The other family is fairly neutral. I initially found the book a bit of a page turner but the author relies too much on coincidence or luck to move the plot a long. The more I read the more tedious I found it and I was glad when I finished.
3,"Hate to be the only one, but...","I enjoyed the first 200 pages of this 426 page book and bits and pieces of the other 226, but overall it was way too long. I really didn't like the unrealistic parts, didn't ""get"" them at all. What was the business about the ""black bloke?"" How about Quick ""glowing?"" What was that? I hated those long-sentence paragraphs inspired by James Joyce, perhaps, show-offy and meaningless. And Fish...well, he drowned once then lived only to drown again. Ho hum.I recommend Winton's ""Dirt Music."" Now there was a book that knew what it was about."
3,You might have to be an Aussie for this one...,"I LOVED this book, don't get me wrong - however, some parts are hard to understand, and at times, digest.With strong, animated and very loveable characters (all in their own way), Tim Winton makes you feel like a part of Cloudstreet. With profound statements such as: ""Loving a man was a very silly activity; it was giving to the weak and greedy and making trouble for yourself."", as well as, ""The strong are here to look after the weak, and the weak are here to teach the strong."", you give your heart to this book. As Tim Winton said, ""Didn't it take half your sense away and all your breath?"". It will make you laugh, it will make you long and in the end I guarantee you will miss these families."
3,summary of Cloudstreet,"easy to read,with storyline a little bland although very Australian,the first book I have read by Tim Winton I would probably read more"
3,Good in places not so in others,I found it very difficult to read in places but others were good. Liked that it is set around Perth
3,Okay,"Was pleased when Tim Winton's books were finally released for the Kindle, as they have long been on my to read list. It's reputation did not live up to my experience though, it's large cast of characters were just not engaging to me."
4,A beautiful story,"Cloudstreet wasn't a book I couldn't put down, but one I always enjoyed picking up. It's the first, and to date only, Winton book I've read, and I can now appreciate the hype.Winton has a unique writing style and undeniable knack for creating relatable, lovable characters. His ability to develop a sense of time and place is masterful.Cloudstreet doesn't offer a compelling plot, but, ultimately, it's a beautiful story."
1,Pulp Fiction,"One star is unfair judgement but, the lowest rating allowed.My usual choice in reading matter is non fiction, so I concede to being off balance with the reading of such waffle.Only excuse for buying this book was the ""best of ten books"" rating ( ABC TV first Tuesday book club Australia) this year.In future I intend to investigate contents in detail and hopefully avoid throwing money away."
1,It would be nice if this book was based on facts...,"Dr. O'Callaghan forces his own unbalanced opinions upon the reader. Hopefully, anyone reading this book will also take the time to read information based upon facts and widely accepted viewpoints and theories, not just one person's beliefs. It would be nice to think that all problems children have could be resolved as simply as the author implies. Recent studies have shown otherwise. But, one could chose to ignore these facts and studies,as Dr. O'Callaghan does."
1,Not the toothbrush in picture!,I was sent a different toothbrush then what was pictured.I know its just a toothbrush but you take a gamble of what your gonna get when you order stuff over the internet.
1,It is not real Kempo,"I found it is not a good foundation for people who want to learn or practice the KEMPO to read this book. Peolpe who interest in KEMPO or KENPO, I suggest to read the books by Ed Parker or Lee Bachman."
3,A Nice Addition to Your Library,"This book is a reprint of ""Art Directors' Workbook of Type Faces"" so don't do as I did and buy both! The book is well-done and presents many popular foundry type (metal) type faces. I find it valuable when comparing today's digital type fonts with the original. It displays the complete alphabet in a large size for easy comparison and recognition and includes a brief history of the type face. I feel that the book supplements other books such as ""Encyclopedia of Type Faces"" (Jaspert, Berry, and Johnson)."
4,"I've bought two, no problems","I bought two 1750's. I used the first in my office, then bought another for my wife. Both have worked without problems for at least two years. Indeed, I'm in the midst of buying at least my third replacement cartridge for the more heavily used one. My wife uses Windows XP. I use XP for work, Ubuntu Linux for play, and all these systems support the 1750. They rarely jam, and when they do they are easy to unjam."
4,A lovely historical novel...,"The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B. is an interesting and entertaining historical novel. Sandra Gulland has a wonderful and engaging gift for storytelling. It's told in diary form, starting when Josephine (then called Rose) was a precocious fourteen-year-old. The story of this compelling woman begins when a fortune teller predicts that Rose will be ""queen."" She longs to leave her home in Haiti and travel to Paris. The opportunity soon presents itself and she begins an adventurous, remarkable life while at the same time enduring difficult times during the French revolution. Josephine is a survivor and her story is interesting and appealing. The language is beautiful and riveting. This novel is an excellent example of what makes historical fiction so irresistible to me. I'm a sucker for the same and I couldn't put this book down. Highly recommended..."
5,Great Read,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I felt the pacing wasn't consistent - there were moments that I had to push myself to continue where other times I was flying through, not realizing I was still reading at 1 am! However, it is in a diary format, which I think contributed to the overall pacing. I look forward to reading the other 2 books in this series."
4,pretty good,"I liked the story line, but wasn't expecting all the political text. I had a hard time following that part of the book, but really liked the parts about Josephines personal life"
5,Hauntingly Beautiful,"Josephine leaps off the page fully formed. SHe is conjured beautifully in the gorgeous novel. It is going out of print in the UK--so sad!!!!! I re-read it at least once every year. the diary style is stunning, the narrative voice is perfect and one is transported instantly to Napoleonic France. It is staggeringly wonderful."
5,Loved this book and Series!,"If you love history, great female characters and honest writing, then this is the book (series) for you. I gave this book to a few of my friends and family memebers as gifts. Josephine's story should be heard to all. What a strong woman she was. Loved the writing and style of this book. Great read."
1,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"A big disappointment. I know, that Josephine was to lazy to write a diary, she was even to lazy in writing letters - so I cannot appreciate the books of Mrs.Gulland. Her idea of a Rose-Josephine diary is sooo wrong. Try to find the novel ""The roses of Malmaison"" by Gaby von Schoenthan and compare!"
1,Many Lives & Secret Sorrows of Josephine B,"Fascinating peek into her life, the history of France duringthis period and all three in the series a good read."
4,angelina's review,"I thought this book was very historically accurate. I enjoy historical fiction especially in the times of the french revolution and this book delivers on that, however I did find it a bit repetitive in parts and a bit slow in the middle. I also think the author made Josephine, seem to be less of a strong character that I believe she would have been in real life. But overall I enjoyed the book and like I said the history is accurate so you get to learn something in an enjoyable way."
5,One of the best books of the decade..,"A reader in Walnut Creek, California 8/15/99It is commonly said that a good book takes the reader swiftly to another time and place. If this is true, then Sandra Gulland has written one of the best books of the decade!"
5,Excellent historical fiction,"Written in diary form, this novel describes Josephines's early years. A rare good historical novel and I can't wait for the 2 sequels."
3,A Fascinating Tale of a Compassionate Heroine,"""The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B"" by Sandra Gulland is, on the whole, a wonderful book. The story presents to the reader the most turbulent time of France: the French Revolution, which is both fearful and fascinating. Also, Gulland does a very good job on the writing, and she can, at times, convey Josephine(Rose)'s feeling so well that you can feel Josephine's pain and despair. However, I found Josephine a rather weak character; she always describes the terrible and unfortunate events happening around her, but she never has the power to control them, which makes me think that she is pathetic. However, I do admire Josephine's great compassion for the weak and poor. Also, some parts of the book are ladened with tedious politics, which I did not find very interesting to read about. But this is a good book to read nonetheless. I would highly recommend this book to people who enjoy reading historical/romantic fiction."
2,Overdone,"Although this book has some fine moments where I think the author really speaks to the readers and lets them know what Josephine's interior life might of been like, these moments do not make up for the failings of the book.The author seems so pleased with herself for the research she did it is as if she cannot stop reminding the reader of all that she learned. I found the footnotes to be insulting and many times writen as if the reader had no knowledge whatsoever of the time period or of Josephine's actual life. The author was so intent on proving that she had throughly researched her subject that she let it disrupt the flow of her novel.I was impressed with all that she knew about Josephine and France, however I wish she would have incorporated that knowledge into the body of the novel instead of endlessly intrupting her often engaging prose with footnotes.Overall not a bad book and I did learn some new things but I wish that her style was less self-conscious."
4,A wonderfuly devine and elegant book.,"I started reading this book because i had a grade 12 english assignment revolving around it. I initially thought it was going to be a book that I would have to force myself to read. However I was pleasently surprised to find that it was not going to be the case. THE MANY LIVES AND SECRET SORROWS OF JOSEPHINE B. is an increadably intense yet enjoyable book. I absolutly fell in love with the language and life of these couragious people in their quest for freedom, and of this fragile woman who made such a huge inpact on the lives of the people around her. It is a pufect portrail of life in these times."
3,Scope is good but the tripod is junk,"I bought this kit a few years ago for my son. On first use, the most notable thing about the kit is the cheap tripod which was loose, impossible to adjust finely and did not hold position very well. About the third time we used it the center broke out of one of the cheap, hollow,knurled plastic knobs securing the pivot, which rendered the tripod completely unusable. Now we have to position the scope using sandbags in order to use it.In my opinion, there is no excuse to saddling a decent spotting scope with such a cheap, breakage prone tripod."
5,"Always My Child: A Parent's Guide to Understanding Your Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgendered or Questioning Son or Daughter",This is an honest and on the mark book for parents about LGBTQ children and teens. It addresses issues important to the LGBTQ son or daughter and gives practical advice to the parent about acceptance and understanding.
3,A little outdated,"My son is 14 and is gay. I was hoping to get a little more knowledge on how raising a gay teenager was different from any other teenager. This really didn't help that much. It seemed more geared toward pre- ""coming out."" Also, the book is about 8 yrs old, and it seemed outdated already. Then again, much has happened in 8 yrs."
1,Here's Julia's experience. Where's the strength and hope?,"Julia Cameron just fell off her pedestal of heroism for me. Oh, my gosh. That was the most painful book I have read in years. Where's the context for her pain in this book? I actually had bad dreams from reading this book.Where's the insight, strength, and hope for the reader to connect to the author? Where's the connection for the reader to care about this story and how does it inspire the reader in life? Frankly, a recantation of years of a tragically painful life and a few slogans from AA just don't make a story inspirational.I wish I had passed on reading this monolithic listing of life tragedies, which seems to have no happy ending, even philosophically. I hope the author finds the help needed in private therapy and doesn't publish any more life stories disguised as a ""creative memoir"", for the public."
2,You might wish you hadn't read this book.,"I have read the Artist's Way, The Sound of Paper, The Right to Write, A Vein of Gold, and now Floor Sample. I am thus familiar with Julia Cameron. Oddly enough, I read this book quickly in two days, finding it hard to put down, but the last 100 pages or so seemed to be rushed and erratic.It was a brave memoir, she is obviously a talented artist (but didn't we all know that already?) Some of the mental/emotional instability issues seem to me to make it difficult to recall her in a more objective sense. I have absolutely no prejudice against mental illness and am not saying that gives her less credibility. Instead, it just came to be distracting to me, and I want to be able to work her books and reread them without having this personal information about her come to mind.When I finished this book, I had the distinct feeling that I wish that I had never read it.Not recommended"
3,Good memoir but not about becoming an artist,"I enjoyed this book. The author was very open about her struggles in life and how she overcame them time and time again. She often overcame struggles through sheer determination and her love of writing. I loved how she found and surrounded herself with people who were honest, motivational, supportive and challenged her. I choose to read this book based on the description on the back saying ""...a journey that many of us who work in the arts recognize-that of becoming an artist."" This was the reason I rated the book as ok; it wasn't about becoming an artist. She did become an artist through her life but that didn't seem to be a challenge for her. All too often her art came to her quickly and easily, almost too easily; even the author had trouble accepting it. The book focused more on her alcoholism, mental challenges and restlessness."
4,Great read,"Coming off of 'The Artist's Way' I was curious to know about Julia. It was how she got to where she was to the The Artist's Way. I thought it was a great journey and an enjoyable read, her struggle to find sobriety and her own center, it was much more valid than a lot of other memoirs I've read."
3,oh dear,"I am not of the generation that got swept away with the Artist's Way phenomenon, but I do like memoirs, so picked this up at the library.The reviewer that said that after this book, the whole Artist's Way method seemed to be about tapping in to or tuning in to impuses and psychotic voices seemed really astute to me. I ended up with that concern as well. The grandiosity! The lack of insight about her impact on others. The obsessional focus on ""art"" as though it excuses anything.I really wondered about what the people around her would say, and how very different their view of her might be. I worried, as have others, about the impact of all this on her daughter. Julia Cameron seems to have foisted her investment in ""specialness"" and ""art"" onto her daughter, and that can't have been easy."
5,It's fantastic!,"I bought this for my girlfriend, but wanted it to be a surprise...but how to keep it a surprise till the very last minute? I decided to apply this product to her while asleep. Unfortunately, she is not a very still sleeper -- she sleeps like a log, alright, a log ROLLING down a hill (a steep hill). So, anyway, I jabbed her in the eye with this quality product. Now she has to wear an eye-patch (which is cool). A bonus: the pencil will now last twice as long (since she now has only one eye to apply it to). All in all, a great product...and Amazon's service is the best."
4,Pimpsta: South Side Soldier,"Pimpsta's album entitled ""South Side Soldiers"" is a must have for people who can't get enough of that southern swang.The songs that really stand out on ""South Side Soldiers"" are: Ransom Note, Seven Signs, When The Club Close, Professional Crack Slanga, United We Stand, and Rollin On Them Thangs (Screwed Out).I give this album 4 stars for Pimpsta's unique lyrical style and for the tight production.Pimpsta is definetly someone you will want to keep your eye on for the future. I have a feeling he along with other Dallas artists are going to be the next big thing to blow up.Also, check out his other albums, ""Lay Off That Wada"" and ""Smokin Big"".Peace!"
1,Defective dvd,DVD was defective--last half the audio was totally out of sync. Standing Ovation took forever to acknowledge my complaint. After 4 or 5 e-mails they finally responded. A refund or a new dvd is being processed. I'm not sure which. Communication is not the best.
5,Great Fence,"Easy to set up. I have the Jessem table and the holes are pre set. However, I think it would not take that much more with another brand table. The fence is really solid and heavy. Fit and finish are out- standing. Vacuum port works fine. Zeros out perfectly. Easy to calibrate. A high end tool.Is it better than a lower priced fence? Fence setting is way above other fences. But I have made some beautiful stuff with my old Rockler fence and table. Those are moderately priced and quite good. You are paying for quality when you step up another hundred bucks. If I was just starting out with router tables and fences, I'd like to think I would pass by the Rockler and move straight to the Jessem. For the long haul, that's the best choice. But maybe money considerations would pull me to the Rockler. Both are good products, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for.Will"
2,Mediocre Quality - TERRIBLE Customer Service,"When I first installed the fence, I noticed that the faces of the moveable sub-fences are recessed about 1/16"" behind the front of the fence itself, making it impossible to get a square cut on any piece that is taller than the sub-fences. The work piece gets pushed out of square by the top part of the fence. I have tried numerous times to get in touch with someone at JessEm to discuss this problem, and no one has gotten back to me.Definitely not the quality product they claim!"
3,A bunch of Bilko,"Not a bad Bio of the great Phil Silvers, but it should have included a few scenes from the film of the stage show the title was taken from, 'Top Banana', otherwise quite an interesting look at the man forever associated with 'Sgt.Bilko' from his famous television series. A man who more than once found himself ruining his life and family because of a life long gambling addiction, he was perhaps more like 'Bilko' than he'd care to let on, however, faults aside, Silvers was undoubtedly one of the great vaudevillian style comedians, who succeded in translating his talent to the big and small screen for over 40 years. He deserves to be remembered!"
5,For minds that MUST know!,"While the Visual Encyclopedia of Science basically covers science, this encyclopedia covers so much more. You will find some similarities between the two books in the science section and that is to be expected.However, I could not believe how much information they have packed into this tiny book! If you want to know about the Earth, you can learn about volcanoes, earthquakes, the oceans, glaciers, climates and ecosystems.If you want to learn about specific states or countries, you can find all the statistics you could possibly want. I found things like: ""France produces over 300 types of Cheese"" very tasty information.Some of the fun items in this book include:A picture of the Mona LisaMovie FactsThe Olympic Games and where they took place since 1896 to 2000.A Timeline of World HistoryUnits of measurementsTransportation through the AgesHow your body fights InfectionFossilsGalaxies...And so much more!Highly Recommended as a Fun Learning Experience.~The Rebecca Review"
1,"Carole Lombard, the Hoosier Tornado","The book was poorly written. It started with her death, but shed no new light to what the average movie fan already knew. It seemed that the writer went on the internet, found some old articles and put them together and called it a book. I read it in one hour and just finished it simply because I started it."
1,not happy...........:-(,The color was not the same and it didnt fit.... it fits my 6year old im not the type of person that returns items its just going to be there just there in my daughters toy box. im also not the kind that complains but this was behond
3,Fulfilling an obligation,"This is not one of Sting's best albums and seems a bit overproduced. He probably felt pressure to meet a contract obligation and just released an okay album. A few of the songs are quite good, but it would have been better to just download those and pitch the rest. If you can find it at a good price, I say get it and especially if you are a Sting fanatic, like I once was. Christ is King!"
2,Not fine-toothed enough for cat fleas,"Out Persian cat brought fleas from a summer vacation in the country. After we cleaned the cat and treated the house with chemicals, I purchased this comb to clean up the remainder of the tiny yet highly resilient bunch of uninvited visitors. As I combed the cat, 3 out of 4 times, a flea, even a dead one, would pass right through this comb. Among the few successful catches, most of the time the extracted flea would get stuck between two adjacent comb teeth and it would require a soapy water solution (as per comb instructions) to wash the flea out. I am returning this comb and looking for a finer one.UPDATEAfter extensive search, found a much better all-metal alternative (ASIN: B0002ASFZU)."
5,the best flea comb u can buy,"Best possible flea comb. This works great for my cats and lasts. I hate using chemicals, so this is a great way to keep them flea-free!"
2,Much smaller than Described,"The dimensions in the description are incorrect. - It is actually .25 inches x 1.25 inches x 6.25 inches (I just measured it.). MUCH smaller than the dimensions given in the description, which are 0.2 x 2.5 x 9 inches. Its small size is awkward in the hand for a male, such as me. Probably not for a female buyer, though."
3,It was too.......something,"I'm sorry maybe it's just me but I didn't think it was all that. Even when I read ""All That And A Bag Of Chips"" I couldn't wait to put it down. But it was something about it that sucked me in and made me want to read ""Been There Done That"". But when I read it I was like what??? I think it was kind of weird that after her true ""love dies"" she runs back to the other ""true love"" and after all that went down he still loved her. And I also find the part at the end where Jarvis comes to her in the hospital to tell her that he wants her to be with Craig a little...how should I say, strange, stupid, unreal. I mean I think it was good for what it was but the fact that it was written in third person annoys the crap out of me."
4,"Been There, Done That was more enjoyable than ATAABOC","Been There, Done That is the continuing story of Venice and her family from the first novel, All That and a Bag of Chips.Craig was a favorite of mine from the first novel and here he gets his own story. I enjoyed this book more than the first book. Mainly because it's mostly about Craig and also because Venice seems a little bit more mature now that's she's had time to settle down.Now I look forward to reading her last novel in the trilogy, What goes around comes around. Her writing's still not up to par with my favorite writers but it's enough for me to give her another chance."
4,Twice in one lifetime...,"In BEEN THERE, DONE THAT, Ms. Lee has crafted a well written story, combining romance and drama that is sure to make this a favorite among readers. This is a must read and I look forward to other works by Ms. Lee.Reviewed by Renee Williamsof The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersComplete review can be found on our website..."
5,Been There Done That,"This was a great follow up to All That and A Bag of Chips. I really enjoyed following the story of Craig and Venice. It reads like a song, just flowing. I have great admiration for the writer. Thanks for sharing your talents with the rest of us."
3,I'm not convinced,"I loved the book ""All that and a bag of chips"". While I thought the author definitely had room for some growth, I found the plot to be riveting and her descriptions to be appealing. I developed a true reaction to each character. I was excited to hear about the sequel and now that I have read it I am disappointed. I am a person who loves HAPPY endings and for things to go the main characters way, but COME ON... it was sooo unrealistic. I liked the ideas of where she went with the characters there is definitely a need for more action in the plot. Her sophmoric attempt was still that of a freshman."
3,More of the same....,"I was waiting for the sequel to Ms. Lee's ""All That and a Bag of Chips"" with some anticipation. Unfortunately in this continuation of the Venice/Jarvis/Craig saga, we pretty much see more of the same. Venice has gone back to the familiar with her high school sweetheart Jarvis and Craig is struggling to ever love so deeply again. This could have been a great jumping off point for a more mature novel that explored the adult life of these characters.Instead, we get pretty much more of the same drama and self-centered Venice that we saw in the first novel. This time it's not as captivating. You'd expect to see the characters develop emotionally and explore a different set of issues perhaps...The first time the author evoked emotions of annoyance in me in regards to Venice. This time I just didn't care.Alas, Ms. Lee gives a predictable, if unrealistic, picture of the continuing saga of Venice...Could have been better for me!"
3,Good but not the best...,"I read this wanting to know more about the main characters, but Darrien jumped around alot and left me wanting more...if you read All that and a Bag of Chips you will understand this book but if you didn't you won't be lost..."
4,Love will find a way,"The end of All that and a bag of chips left me wondering, but it was obvious what was going to happen. Sad, but not like I could do anything about it. I'd wanted Craig and Venice to get back together anyway. I think this was an almost perfect sequel to the first one. They'd been separated for years and found each other again after tragedy. Gives hope that there's not just one Soul mate for us our there."
1,L-A-M-E!,"This book is ridiculously predictable and unrealistic, starting with the title. The first book in this series was pretty good, although amateurish. This sequel made me roll my eyes numerous times, from the MULTIPLE typos to the absolutely contrived story line.I like happy endings, but it gets old when pretty much everything Venice could ever want is handed to her (AGAIN), while she whines and vacillates unnecessarily. Glad I got this one from the library! Check out Donna Hill's books for a more mature, captivating and well-written storyline. I'm hooked!"
2,Expensive toner,"I was on the verge of buying this printer on sale for my father, and then I checked on the price of toner. The toner cartridge (reportedly 3000 pages) runs at about twice the cost of a 3000-page-toner cartridge on my beloved Brother laser printer. For me, the initial investment of an extra few dollars on a Brother will repay itself the very first time I buy toner. I guess Samsung learned from the ink-jet marketing scheme of making their money on overpriced ink/toner.I am not sure why one customer reviewer claims that the Samsung toner cartridge comes with a drum unit. When I researched the price of the toner cartridge, drum units for this printer were sold separately, and at quite a high price."
4,Samsung ML-1710 Review & OSX,"I bought one of these printers for use under OSX and agree that the CD-ROM driver is useless. I managed to track down the OSX drivers on the website. It was definitely very hard to find, and I seemed to have trouble getting to the same cite repeatedly, hence I include the above address. Graphics quality was so-so, some definite banding in dark areas, but otherwise good for print. GIMP-Print (CUPS) does not support yet."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This printer was purchased for low volume office use. From day one, the toner has been unevenly distributed across the printed pages. Shaking the toner cartridge as Samsumg suggests works for a page or two but them it's back to the same problem. The printer is useless for printing envelopes. They come out faint as a watermark and barely readable every time. Reading other reviews reveals that there is no fix for this problem. My advice - as with almost everything else, is that you get what you pay for. Don't waste your money on this product."
4,Satisfied customer,"No problems with WinXP installation. Print quality very good, and 600 DPI doesn't slow it down perceptibly. I prefer 600 dpi; crisp and not too dark.Excellent value. Note: it is clearly stated that the included toner is only a partial 1/3 load (1000 pages); I kept it as a spare and installed a full one. It has lasted over a month of fairly heavy use. No jams or paper problems after 1000+ pages.Paper loading is easy, but you DO have to push down on a spring at the front of the paper tray before loading. No big deal, but perhaps some people don't read instructions and may have jams."
2,Don't waste your time,"This is not a serious printer. If you want to print more than, say, 2 pages a month, save your money (doesn't take that much) and buy a Hewlett Packard. Also, good luck with their ""tech support.""This will be my last Samsung product."
2,Mediocre Printer at Best,"This printer has terrible color translation drivers and produces the aboslute worst grey scale renditions of any laser printer I have used. The text is inconsistent in darkness, and the outer edges of the right side of the page are clearly lighter in toner than the rest of the page.Beware of this mediocre unit."
2,Fine for college kids and below. Disappointing otherwise.,"I bought this printer because it got very good reviews and was cheap. I had to replace my Epson which I loved, but it wasn't compatible with OSX when I upgraded my system. The printer works. That's about the best I can say about it. It's slow to start up and is noisy. Things I can overlook because I don't print much, but annoying nonetheless. I had my Epson for over 2 yrs. and printed a lot - never ran out of ink and ink never faded. I've had this printer for less than a year, I've printed a fraction of the amount from the Epson, and it's already fading even after shaking the toner. Also, it doesn't always print straight. Fine for notes, terrible for resumes and serious letters."
2,Get what you pay for....,"Ok printer, but after about 200 pages, I notice that every page looks like its printed in toner saver mode (read: looks horrible with toner saver turned on) even though it's not. Manual paper feed is schizophrenic at best, you have to wait for the previous page to feed and wait for the fuser to spin down before inserting the next sheet, otherwise it will cause a paper jam. Then, of course, you have to wait for the thing to spin up again before it starts the next page. Sometimes, manual feed will just run a sheet of paper thru the unit for giggles..."
2,Not suitable for printing ebook,"It has been only one week since I bought Samsung ML-1710 Laster Printer. I still like the simple design and speed of the printer.The problem is while printing a lot of documents and ebooks.A paper or paper get stuck quite often.The jamming problem would be one of the most frustrating problems found in a printer. It's also time consuming to get of the jammed paper and to start printing from where I stopped.The heat produced from the printer curls paper a lot and it does not even look nice and flat. Sometimes I had to put a stack of printed papers between my encyclopedia and stepped on it to flattend them.And today,I made a decision to take it back tomorrow afternoon."
1,Bad Quality,"I thought I had a deal when I bought Samsung's ML-1710 Laser Printer... The Printer worked great for about three months. Now it prints uneven. What I mean is that there are light uneven spots. I thought it was bad toner. I poped 90 bucks out and bought a new genuine Samsung toner. The same results. It's obviously not the toner, but the workman ship. Samsung, it's true that when a customer has a good experience, he would tell ten other people, and when they get a bad experience, he would also tell ten other people. When ever anyone asks me, which is quite a few, i would tell them to avoid Samsung."
4,"High quality, small footprint, so-so drivers","I really like this unit. I bought it to replace a previous Samsung laser printer that I used on my old Windows 2000 PC. This new one has a USB port (instead of the ancient parallel port) which means it works with my new PowerMac G5. It has high build-quality, excellent print quality, and a very small footprint. I just wish that it had better driver support for Mac OS X.Samsung, write better Mac OS X drivers and you'll start getting 5-stars from your Mac-using customers!"
1,WARNING - no mac support,"Starting from end of April 2004, Samsung will stop supporting MacOS. That means no more updates or fixes for the drivers. I have purchased this last year and now I regret it. I will try to get rid of this printer as soon as possible."
1,Fade print after printing 200 pages,"Now, the print out cannot even read, and the total print page nowis only 944 (But it faded after 200 pages) -- buy another one if you really want a workable printer."
1,DONT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"After only 6 months my printer gave out completely. Then I did some research to find out why. It seems that with the Samsungs, if they run out of toner, they blow and no more printer. Sorry to say this also happened on my 1410 Samsung after 9 months!!!! I should have learned but thought it was a fluke. It also takes forever to warm up, is very loud and quality not so hot. For those of us using printers a lot steer aay from this one. There is no way to know you are low on ink except for quality of print which is not so hot any way Dont bother calling customer service either.....sheesh!"
2,80 bucks for toner?,"In interests of full disclosure, I chose not to buy this printer due to toner costs. Just check those costs before you buy. A 3000 page toner costs $79, versus $54 for the toner of an equivalent Brother (say the HL1440 which I have owned) or $70 for a 6000 page Brother toner. I think Samsung is known to do this ""make the profit in the refills"" for this printer."
2,Cheap printer if that is what u r looking for!,"Pro: cheapest lazer printer I can findCons(after using it for three months):* Manual feed is problematic; its extremely hard to get the paper feed perfectly straight. Paper always come out wrinkled.* Consistent paper jam (at least several times a day)* Takes a long time to get the printer to print when its on Toner Save mode.* On some programs (ex: Batchmaster), it cuts off some of the fonts. But it works on my HP and Brother lazer printer.* Expensive Toner. This is more like a disposible printer!"
4,Pretty good deal!,"The Samsung ML-1710 Laser Printer is an excellent deal: generally, text and graphics are very sharp and crisp. And the compact size makes it ideal for even the smallest home office.Only gripe: after good initial results in the ""toner save"" mode, the print is now just simply to light to continue in this mode. Same is true if you print on envelopes, even with ""toner save"" off.Overall, though, this is a great printer that won't disappoint."
1,Fades quickly,"Mine faded even on the first few pages. This could be an individual case, but I was very disappointed at this problem. Now I have printed about 300 pages? in total, and none of them was dark enough to read in dim light."
3,Quickly uses expensive toner,"Any savings by purchasing this cheap printer will soon be overcome by costs on toner. I bought this as a replacement for HP 1100, which broke after several years. The main problem I have encountered is that the cartridge only prints about 1000 pages. That means you have to fork out either $80 for a new cartridge or $50 for a refill. The HP could do about 3-4000 pages on a single $40 cartridge."
1,Not worth the time,"I was not happy with this product. I had it shipped to me, and as soon as I got it, I had to ship it back. Paying two shipping fees of 17.85 is not worth your time. If you are going to buy this product, I suggest going into your local electronics store to look at it first."
5,A MUST for Reiki practioners,"The Reiki Handbook is an invaluable source of knowledge and wisdom dating back to the beginning of this ancient Japanese healing technique rediscovered by Usui Shiki Ryoho; the Reiki student will revert back to this manual over and over again. Having used the techniques illustrated in The Reiki Handbook there is no doubt this is the most clear and concise manual with the ORIGINAL applications. I am convinced this is the ONLY manual for Reiki students and therapists. After witnessing the effects of Reiki and having used The Reiki Handbook myself, I would recommend this book to everyone. A wonderful addition for anyone involved with, or interested in, alternative methods of healing."
2,Basic Reiki & Lots of Misinfo,"This book presents itself as a Reiki I manual, and uses a lot of space to show hand positions and leaves spaces for notes and journaling. It devotes a lot of space to Reiki for animals and provides some simplistic information about healing diets and dishes for humans and animals. It tells the Reiki history that has been shown to be mythology, and generally presents only basic and incomplete information. I guess only a Reiki I would be likely to accept this book as authoritative. There are now many other more useful books about Reiki, and if you want to take notes during your practice just buy a cheap pad or book of paper."
4,Reiki Handbook,This is a great book for beginners. I use this book as a teaching guide for my Reiki 1 classes. It gives great information and has helpful pictures and a reference section in the back of the book to help with specific conditions.
2,Love cracker ... most of them were broken,Over half the crackers in each of all six boxes were broken. I want to spread different things on these crackers and can't with pieces. I love the crackers though. I'll just have find somewhere to buy them where the breakage isn't so severe that I feel ripped off. Obviously I won't be ordering them again here.
3,Great Taste!,"These are fantastic tasting crackers but I didn't reorder because my hands felt like I had been eating potato chips! Too much fat for me, that's probably why they taste so good. If you're skinny and have the self control to eat just two or three and put the box away, then go for it. I wish I did!"
3,Too big for me!,"This leather tote is made very well and the camel color is soft and casual, so for that I would've given it five stars. However, it's so BIG!!! The description of this bag written by Amazon if dead on--it's a LARGE bag. I don't know for what occassion anyone would bring this purse. I am a mother of twins, so I guess I could always use it as my diaper bag, Ha! Ha! Seriously, if you like a large, fashionable tote, perhaps even a briefcase alternative, then this is the bag for you. But, if you're like me, this one is just too big."
5,GREAT and FANTASTIC reference,it is an excellent reference for anyone who does Cryogenics and deals with superconducting magnets on a daily basis! just awesome!!!
1,not the right item,the item shown is NOT a Makita 724950-8D Wet/Dry Diamond Saw Blade and the price is NOT what a Makita 724950-8D Wet/Dry Diamond Saw Blade would sell for
5,Hilarious mystery about two bickering cowboy brothers who ...,"(***** = breathtaking, **** = excellent, *** = good, ** = flawed, * = bad)... solve a mystery while working for corrupt ranch-owners in the 1880s. Longer review available at ImpatientReader-dot-com."
3,Needs help.,"Well written but the story is just not there. Too slow, little action and not a lot of interest developed with the man characters."
3,Neat idea but bloated story,"This tribute to Sherlock Holmes inadvertently shows why the best Holmes stories were short stories, not novels. The book is heavily padded at 300 pages and is tiresome to slog through."
4,What a surprise!,"This book is delightful. I am a fan of Sherlock Holmes, and was primarily attracted to this book because of the title. Imagine my surprise to find it a good read, as well as a clever idea. I was most impressed by the subtlty-- the clues were all there, but not obvious as clues (usually) until they were pointed out later. This meant that I could keep up with Old Red if I tried, but I usually didn't notice that the time for ""deductifyin'"" was at hand. Hooray."
4,Happy Surprise,"I'm not sure why I even chose this one, but I'm so glad I did. Although it's not a favourite genre for me, I was entertained all the way. The writer is very funny and fairly original.Audio: This reader came so close to being in the top rank, but he has a tendency to over-act slightly. Much of the time he sounds more like he's telling a story on a Vaudeville stage rather than imparting to you something that really happened. Still, he's endearing and talented."
5,Highly recommended,"I recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in education or the social sciences. The ""Underground History"" will never receive sweeping acclaim because of the condition it so well describes. Gatto's writing is clear and crisp."
3,"Good product, slow delivery","I was planning to use this hat for a birthday gift, but it took so long to com that I'm giving it for Christmas."
5,Don't fall prey to fads and anecdotal reviews,"I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow."
4,stops fecal balls,"My eight month old kitty, Jitterbug came to us eating Science Diet and everything was fine. I slowly switched him over to Purina indoor, which I've always fed my cats and had no problems with. Well I started noticing Jitterbug was leaving small little balls of poo all over the house! Instead of taking him to the vet and paying a lot of money on tests I thought I'd try this expensive food first and what do you know, no more poop balls! It's too bad it's so pricey, but if I don't have to deal with feces outside the litter box, I'll pay top dollar. My cat has been on this formula for a month now and I'm very pleased with the results."
3,Meh,"I bought this for my cat, who suddenly started vomiting on a daily basis. No rhyme or reason for it either, not hairballs, or some kind of illness. This didn't help the vomiting issue and considering the cost of the food and composition, I've since switched her to a product richer in proteins that costs a similar amount and actually seems to have quickly cleared up the problem."
5,My cat likes the taste,"My cat is 13 years old. I had been feeding her Friskies Dental Diet for most of her adult life, but it was discontinued. While on the dental diet she never needed to have her teeth cleaned. I decided to try the Science Diet brand. She seems to really enjoy the taste of it. I mix it with some smaller dry food and she picks out the large Science Diet food first. It's too soon to see if it will work as well as the Friskies on her teeth, but hopefully it will."
2,Not an accurate assessment,"I gave this video as a gift to a person that was in the Battle of the Bulge and he said it was not good. It was told more from the English perspective than the American perspective which didn't sit well since the English lost 200 soldiers and the Americans lost 80,000 in this battle. The audio was not good either. Only mentions Patton's army once."
4,mando diao bring 'em in,"amazing album... just great rock and roll... most of the album is like the strokes and libertines, but with a more poppy feel.but songs like ""lady"" are straight forward 60s blues/garage rock (from the likes of the yardbirds or the small faces).""Mr. Moon"" and ""Lauren's Cathedral"" are some more really original songs that are a but more mellow than the rest, but are still awesome to say the least"
4,kick ... rock and roll with a poppy twist,"great album from mando diaothink the strokes and the libertines, but more melodious and poppy"
3,Mando Diao brings em in,"Here's a couple of bands to namedrop. Anyone remember mid-90's Britpop upstarts Menswear? How about Crispian Mills' post-Kula Shaker project The Jeevas? Well just think a more garage-rock version of both those bands. For a more general description, 'Bring Em In' basically combines The Hives-like garage rock with Britpop swagger. The Swedes always seem to put a unique spin on Western-style pop/rock, and this brash debut definitely fits that. Brit-garage-pop, Swedish style."
2,Punk garage attitude at an early stage from Sweden,"On this first effort ""Bring'em in"" from this swedish band MANDO DIAO, these guys play noisy, raw and energetic music, you can notice they are excited for having their first recording. They could become the Artic Monkeys from Scandinavia except that they were very young at that time and didn't have the right direction. Compared to Libertines, Hives or White Stripes they didn't were a breaktrough in the American continent. Eventhough I didn't really liked this CD, I still admit they do good music and they improved through the years (listen to the bit different GIVE ME FIRE last release including track ""Dance with somebody""), they evolved into a more dance oriented. I will go and buy the latest releases and just leave this first CD for fans. I will give it a 2.5 if I could."
2,Too outdated to be much use.,"Considering the second edition was released in January 2009, it is appalling how little iSCSI is mentioned. According to the index iSCSI is referenced on fewer than 15 of the book's 437 pages. Two SAN vendors have earned a living doing only iSCSI for over eight years and nearly all the rest offer both iSCSI and FC, so to treat this important SAN technology so lightly in 2008 when this book was going into its second edition was a fatal error to my mind. The author needs to rewrite this book quickly to address not only iSCSI, but also storage virtualization (11 pages), tiering of storage (0 pages), serial attached SCSI (SAS) (0 pages), solid-state drives (0 pages), SATA (2 pages), and thin provisioning (0 pages), to name a few. If you know you need Fiber Channel this book has some utility, but as an overiew of the state of the SAN world at press time or today, it is sadly lacking."
3,A bit outdated now..,"Hardly a mention of iSCSI and mostly deals with 1 & 2MBit Fiber Channel, which displays some of it's age. Though, it does a reasonable job of explaining LUN's, naming conventions and the security models in reasonably simplistic terminology. I personally wanted to know more specifically about iSCSI and other newer technologies."
2,A little old,"The 2008 is far away in time.Nothing about FCoE, VMWare, ...NT4.0 is very old operating system.I think this book is a little old.BR // JI"
4,"Quality content, Poor editing",The content is very straightforward and easy to grasp. It's presented well and clearly. I'm only half way through and I feel like I will be able to set up and manage a SAN easily. The only issues I have involve the actual print. There are missing words and words that are run together. Overall I rate it well because the content far outweighs the problems in the proofreading department.
1,Please help. Never showed up.,"Luckily, my boss had already ordered me a copy for when I started my new job because the copy I ordered and PURCHASED never showed up. I tried getting online and finding a way to report this, but could not find an easy way to file a complaint. Glad that Amazon.com values customer input enough to send me an email requesting me to rate the product. PLEASE FOLLOW UP WITH ME REGARDING THIS ISSUE.About the book specifically, it is like the Bible of my work. The content is very helpful and easy to read. The 0 star rating I provided is in regard to the book never showing up. Since my employer also purchased me a copy, I have been able to read and the content and organization of the book deserves 5 stars."
3,Adequate for Executive Management Types,"This is not a technical reference manual. It's intended audience is primarily upper-level management types that won't ever need to configure an initiator or target much less debate the merits or shortcomings of AoE, FC, or iSCSI."
4,PKP,"One of the best SAN book for beginners. Book is very interesting, simple and detailed. Some information is repetitive but that's provide connectivity to previous chapters."
4,"Incredibly difficult subject to conquer, but Dummies makes it entertaining","Good overview of subject, would have like the option to go more into the details of switches. Should be updated too. Easy read, entertaining writers. A true must read for anyone even related to the SANS industry."
5,excellent book. complete and easy to read,"only gripe i have is that some parts are boring, but that'show the subject matter is.Also, not really for dummies. you need to have some ideaabout networks and storage (not much, though).Otherwise, superb book. Can be used as tutorial and asa reference."
5,Love it!,"I bought this while I was in Greece because it was so hot and I wanted a fragrance that wasnt too strong but had a clean smell. My grandmother and my mom loved the fragrance so much that I had to buy a couple bottles for them when i got to the US! I was also surprised by how moisturizing the ""water"" is. FYI, it does smell a lot like mint tea but i think it also has a slightly flowery scent to it. Excellent for summer! Great for all ages!Oh and I know it says in the description section that you should buy the body lotion and shower gel to make the fragrance last but you really dont need to buy anything but the water. Even though the scent is not strong, it definitely lasts. Plus its small enough to fit in your purse if you do need another spritz."
4,Good only for compacts or smaller mirrorless,"I loved this Monopod, unfortunately the ballhead got loose due to the weight of my D200 with small zoom. It cannot hold 21 lbs as advertised. Two to three pounds is more realistic.Since then I moved to a larger monopod but I am purchasing another one so I can use it with my J1s. Nikon 1 system lenses are small/light enough. And the convenience of the size for travel is excellent."
2,You Pay a Nickle..... You Get a Nickles Worth.,"As soon as I received the tripod, I unpacked it and started to unfold it for tripod use. Did what I was told to do (ie instructions on tripod)and promptly broke one of the legs.This is not a Bogen or a Gitzo or even a Slik, nor did it cost as much!In all fairness for a kid starting to take the step from snapshots to photography, this mono/tri pod might be just the ticket!Adult Photographers, pay the money for quality!"
3,Fine for P & S camera but too lightweight for a DSLR,I have used this unit for travel with success for several years. It is fine for a small camera. When I upgraded to a DSLR this monopod just can not handle the weight. The leg will support the camera with a long lens attached. The weak link is the ball head. It sags under pressure of more than a couple of pounds. I gave this to a friend and purchased a real monopod from Benro. It is very heavy duty but much heavier much bulkier. I think this is a great concept and hope this manufacturer will introduce another model that is a bit more heavy duty.
4,A GOOD PIECE OF FOOTBALL NOSTALGIA,"THIS IS ABOUT THE BACKFIELD OF THE 49ERS OF THE MID 1950'S. THE AUTHOR PROVIDES A LOOK AT THE 4 GREATS UP CLOSE. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. IT IS WELL WRITTEN AND HAS SOME GREAT DETAILED GAME ACTION. THE INTERVIEWS ARE ENLIGHTENING AND WELL DONE. TITTLE, JOHNSON, PERRY, AND MCELHENNY ARE ALL CERTAINLY DESERVING OF THE HALL OF FAME. THE STORIES AND INSIGHT BY OPPOSING PLAYERS AND COACHES ADD TO THE EXPERIENCE OF THE NOSTALGIA THIS BOOK BRINGS.RECOMMENDED FOR ALL 49ER AND FOOTBALL FANS."
5,Million Dollar Backfield Book,"I had been looking for this book for awhile. I was affraid I wouldn't be able to find it, and when I did it was in perfect condition. I would recommend this site to anyone looking for books!"
2,Beware Horton Hatches the Egg,Daisy-Head Maizie and The Butter Battle Book are excellent animated shorts based on the seuss books. But Horton Hatches the Egg is the worst animated version of a seuss book I have ever seen. My family was watching it with my 4 yr old and we were all very surprised when in the middle of it a fish character pulls out a gun and shoots himself in the head. Not at all appropriate for kids!
1,Not really for little bitty ones,"This is more for adult Seuss fans. At least when we put it in she didn't hear the familiar Martin Short voice that she expected, got mad and wouldn't watch. And I am glad she didn't due to some of the subject matter. Some of it is just poor done and some just not for little ones. I wish I hadn't bought it. Take your money and buy one of the Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That series DVD's instead. They are good."
3,Butter Battle,I have only watched the Butter Battle video because I use it for a Cold War lesson in my classroom. Pretty good
5,"Fun, fun, fun book!","This has been one of our favorites for a long time. It's fun to follow the cute little red tailed mouse as it scurries over the chair, table, shoe, box etc (all objects have very clever and interesting contours) . The last page when the mouse quickly hides in the hole leaves my toddler in giggles, begging for an encore :)."
5,Great!,This one is so fun to read! I love how the mouse is going up the table leg and as you turn the page his body outline now shows him ready to run across the table. The layout is set up very well!The mouse is racing... racing... and finally... safe in the hole. This is one I don't mind reading again... and again.
3,cool song if you'rte into paganism,"mj dedicated an entire song to the earth goddess cybele, gaea, themis or whoever he had all that surgery trying to mimic."
5,From the first moment...,"From the first moment of this DVD, I felt I had something special coming...and I was correct. This is a treat from start to finish, an amazing performance all around with great sound. My sense of the performance echoes most of the other reviews.I would say to one of the 4-star reviewers that having an aversion to ""sad"" is a major impediment to being an opera fan. I don't envy you (I love the sad). And I would say to the 1-star reviewer, please don't sully performances with a terrible review when your complaint is merely administrative -- and your error at that.A very very satisfying performance, one I will go back to again and again."
2,Everybody Has Been Burned Before,"Remake Alert: Here's another collection of hit songs which is mostly remakes. It's the old ""Original Artists"" ploy: the artists who made the original recordings are enticed into doing new recordings and the results are labeled a ""Greatest Hits"" collection. Of the 30 tracks on 3 CDs 24 are remakes, so noted on the back of the CD.I can't comment on the quality of the production, because I didn't bother to listen past part of one track.I bought this because the label, Platinum Disc, has packaged other greatest hits collections which feature the original recordings, as evidenced by the various labels and copyright dates noted on those CDs. In this case, however, they went the lazy route and I got burned.Don't let it happen to you."
1,Burned... not even the same tempo as the originals...,"Burned, be careful the same package is available with one less disc but identical discs 1 & 2."
5,June's Got It Indeed,"This was one of June's favorite albums and a nice change of pace from the Rugolo-arranged works. This is a more relaxed, off-the-cuff effort with the excellently-chosen tunes delivered matchlessly and with great joy. June sounds so happy here and so at peace as an artist (though she admittedly was never an artist who actually found peace; genuises never do). Every track is pure pleasure. The cover, incidentally, was changed at the last minute. Originally June's right arm was raised; in the finished product, it's extended and if you look you can see the right arm is pasted on her body! Don't you just love stuff like that?"
2,Cheap Gimmick,"The Slime tube sealant, i.e. the green goop that comes in bottles, works. These slime tires are a gimmick; they only succeed in making a mess.I replaced 3 old flat bike tubes with these slime tubes, and each and every one was flat within a month.I should be more specific: These tubes are okay for a street bike because there is very little debri on a street capable of puncturing a tire, thus the slime never sees the light of day. For a mountain bike these things are a disaster. Actually, they go flat more readily than a normal tire tube, likely because the tubes themselves are cheaply made.Road bikes should find these tubes 'suitable', barely, and only because they don't encounter punctures as often. I don't recommend them. Get a bottle of the Slime sealant and pair that with a strong, well made tube."
4,Works like a charm,very good stuff here. These should be standard on every bike. I will buy these from now on for all my bikes.
4,"It holds air, what else do you need.","Unless you are expecting a flat, it isn't worth the premium price. I needed it quick and so I didn't care about the price.A small issue, but it might matter: The valve cap is the same color green as the box. Worked well for me, it matched the color of my daughter's bike. At least you want get caught off guard now if that might matter to you."
1,Arrived with valve problem. Too time consuming to return.,"Arrived with valve problem. Too time consuming to return. The packaging and arrival time were excellent, but it would take more time to repack and return it than it is worth."
2,Great Concept - bad execution,"I hate giving bad reviews - this is my first. However, when this tube burst after the first hour of my son using it, all the slime did was to make it significantly more messy to clean up. I may have overinflated, which is why I don't give it a one or no star. Tire went dead flat and slime went over half the tube. I would've thought the slime would function something like a run-flat. Great price, but not worth it in my opinion."
2,"Slime Smart Tube Schrader Valve tube 24""","I'm sure this will work okay if I need to use it, but the more I looked (after I ordered it, of course) the more I wished I'd ordered a plain tube. Some of the problems are the ""slime"" in the tube making a huge mess in some instances. I'd rather pay a lot less & buy a couple more regular tubes."
4,As expected,The product received was as expected. I haven't had the time to use it yet but I do not see why there would be a problem.
1,peels right off,"Please don't waste your money and time. This is the most useless thing I've ever bought. The lights are so-so, but the adhesive is not going to hold the track and it will peel off. Cheap, that's for sure, but won't save you anything."
3,Valo Accent instant Lighting,"I purchased this light set directly from the manufacturer in early december 2004. It arrived in time for New Years. The installation was fairly straight forward. Locate a suitable wall area and clean off any dust or grime. Run a line with a Level to use as a guide for the Track. Read the Instructions TWICE! Once you remove the protective backing from the track adhesive, you only have ONE CHANCE to get it applied correctly. It does not come off the wall! The lights and power connections are snap on, making the total install time less than 10 minutes. The Lighting effect is great for reading and area illumination. On thing I found is that the power cord and switch get VERY Warm after an hour's on time. I don't know if this is a problem yet as I have referred it to Lite's Now for advise."
4,Great lights,"These lights are great, easy to install in any room. Its too bad they have been discontinued and are getting hard to find. The only odd thing about them is that sometimes the switch gets a little hot."
2,Not so good...,"Don't try to install this on a popcorn ceiling. Even after taking off popcorn and cleaning an area, I still can't get the track to stick."
1,"Not a Blues CD, when compared to the blues greats.","I was told this was a great blues album, similar to Stevie Ray Vaughn and Fabulous Thunderbirds. Well, it is not. Compared to other great blues artists and albums. The music sounds vaguely like ZZ Top in their early days. Especially the first track. It comes close to bar band blues.However, the listener would make a better purchase by buying George Thorogood's Bad to the Bone. If you wanted to hear a really well produced bar band album.As for Southern Rock/Blues mix. They could also purchase ZZ Top's Tres Hombres, Tejas, or Rio Grande Mud.Some of the songs are a far cry from Willie Dixon, but not far off from Charlie Rich mixed with a stripped down Allman Brothers Band. Let me down easy sounds similar to Charlie Rich without a piano.This album misses the mark for blues, but could pass for an late 70's, early 80's country album. Maybe Johnny Paycheck or a soundtrack for the Dukes of Hazzard."
3,quick fix,"if you need these yesterday go to your local hardware store, buy the common 3x21 belts and rip them into strips, they are cheaper and work fine."
4,The Upholsters's Dictionary,"As an Upholsterer's Dictionary it is a good book and rather thorough.There are endless detailed sketches of the equipment Upholsterers use,a glossary of common terms ,information about exhibitions and Fairs etc. However,it isn't a ""how-to"" book. There are no step-by-step projects or photographs. This is a very technical book,a guide to wanna-be upholsterers rather than a guide to anyone who simply wants to experience the joys of a home-made redo."
3,History redux,"I found that this novel was not a smooth read. Too many times, I found myself thinking that I had just read the same material earlier. Perhaps it is just my memory that is bad. History is dry at best without the distraction of fractured narrative."
5,Great read,"I had, for years, believed the airborne part of the Normandy invasion was a colossal failure because of missed DZ's, dispersal of units, etc. After reading this book it appears that the airborne forces managed to succeed in spite of those obstacles. The author presents a convincing argument that Utah Beach could have been a failure without that help. You're never too old to learn."
5,Ready to be read.,This arrived before I finished the reading stack. Picked the wrong year to read first in first out rather than last in first out...
3,Walk Good Review,"Just returned from Negril last month and purchased this book to compare my experience to the author's.I found the book to be an accurate and enjoyable account of the history and feel of Negril. I would recommend it as a guide to anyone who is contemplating a trip there.Up until the author's soon to be wife joined him in Negril to be married I would rate this book as excellent. However the scene and mood took a nosedive when he and his new bride booked into Hedonism (the nudie beach and hotel at the East end of 7 mile beach.)At this point in the book my interest in this book declined radically since I have no desire to be informed of other people's sex life and activities sans vetements.One of the factors that contribute to the loss of a great experience in Negril is the ""all inclusive hotel deals"" A much better feel can be had by getting out and experiencing the locals and cuisine. Negril is a beautiful and friendly place. Rick (Quebec)"
4,Don't go to Jamaica without it!,"Great inside look at the west coast and more of Jamaica. Short chapter/stories about many different aspects of Jamaica. Funny,informative, interesting. Not like other travel books."
4,"Walk Good: Travels to Negril, Jamaica","If you love JA, and you're not from the Island...read this book. It will transport you there(virtual time!) and make you say to yourself""oh yeah, I remember that spot...""You can TASTE the cocobread...and sugarcane...Buy it!A great gift for you or someone you love."
5,This is why I love Jamaica.,"I laughed I cried. If you've been to Jamaica or are thinking about going to Jamaica this is a great book. It will give you a flavor of the country, the people, and his experience there."
5,What a great scooter,"I bought this scooter in the summer and it is great. It goes about 15 miles an hour but seams a lot faster than that. It says it only goes 8 miles but I went 12 miles on it one time and it was running fine. The manufacturer offers a six month warranty on parts, a thirty day warranty on tires, and a three month warranty on batteries. The battery takes about six hours to charge. It last a long way too. Fortunantly, there are no loose wires except on the plug and play battery pack which is only one wire. This scooter is a good deal even though it is two hundred dollars. It last a long time and can live threw all types of terrains. I am only thirteen and I love it!!! You would too. TWO THUMBS UP. Sincerely, Matt Yensan, Columbia SC"
1,dont waste your time,Don't waste your time with this scooter...I don't know if it is fun yet because the battery that came with it was no good. When Currie sent a new one they never sent the wires so we still can't use it. Besides the waiting for the parts it takes days to get in touch with Currie.
1,"Buyer Beware, fun while it last",My daughter loved this scooter and it is a blast to ride the problem is they break. I bought one for my kid and my neighbor bought 1 for his. Mine quit working in about 2 weeks and they tried to fix it but couldn't so it was replaced with a new scooter. My neighbors quit after about 4 weeks and he just got his money back. a few weeks after that my second scooter quit working. Got my money back. 3 scooters all quit working. A+ on idea F- on quality
1,horrible,"do not but this item has broke many times trust me i would know i have one in my garage that i got arrested for, for just having it!!!!!!(60 dollar ticket)"
3,"Fast ride, but lots of problems!!!","My sister and I bought 3 of these scooters at the same time for our kids. Every single scooter has had a problem. My brakes on my son's scooter has been adjusted three times. My nieces scooter has been taken back and fixed by the store due to brake problems. After receiving it back, the scooter sometimes won't work at all. Must be some kind of connection problem. My nephew has to constantly fix the chain on his scooter due to it coming off. In addition, the scooters ride louder than other ones we have previously owned.I still believe that Mongoose makes some of the best scooters. We had a 250 and never had the first bit of problems out of it. That scooter lasted for years, but I think the Z350 models does have some kinks the company has to work on. Overall the scooter is fast, powerful, low charge time, but the problems we've had has caused some headaches. My advice is if you buy this scooter GET the extended warranty that Toys R Us offers."
2,Mongoose Z350 Cable Break,"""Upset Scooter Mom"" of West Virginia is correct - My 9 yr old daughter rode it for a week before the throttle cable snapped (like a twig) while turning in our cul-de-sac. I twisted (using electrician pig-tail method) the snapped wires together and taped up to no avail - they just separated again. [...] Good Luck!"
4,From another Skynyrd fanatic,"I've read Brant's book and this one. In addition, I visited all the relavent web sites I can find including www.skynyrd.com and Ed King's web site. Ballinger's book is very good. It's readable and is built on many resources. Brant's book is almost painful to read but compliments this one very well. After all the reading I have done I have come to the conclusion that we will never know all the facts surrounding this great band. There are just too many contradictions amongst all the accounts. However, Ballinger does a good job of presenting what is probably the most factual information available. This is a must read for all LS fanatics and recommended for anyone else who is interested in the history of Rock and Roll."
4,Pretty good,"The book if full of quote of both LS members and people who were around them in their heyday for one reason or another. It also features some nice photos. When you get to Ronnie's reaction to the announced crash landing, you're left to decide whether version to believe - Gene Odom's or Artimus'. I tend to believe the former's."
1,Not worth reviewing,"One improtant thing a smart reader should look for when considering a book, any book, is the auther. The auther here is ""anonymous""!!! That, by itself, discredits this book in its entirety from cover to cover. I would much rather spend my money and time on something much more interesting, credible, and holds at least some truth to it, which is clearly and unquestionably lacking in this book."
5,A brave and valuable resource in the war on terrorism,"Anonymous grew up as an Iraqi Jew. She is fluent in the language and culture of the Islamic terrorists while still having the perspective of a civilized supporter of democracy and freedom. She grew up in Iraq, escaped with the remains of her family to Israel, and settled in the United States. She continues to apply her background and incisive intelligence to understanding, explaining and forecasting the actions of terrorists.You can see how difficult that is by viewing an Islamic extremist website. You probably cannot read a single word or even understand a single letter of the alphabet. Imagine yourself at one of the frequent Islamic extremist meetings held at hotels and public places in the U.S.A. You will probably not understand a word since they will almost all be in Arabic.Anonymous is a brave and valuable resource in the war on terror. User her."
4,The Failure of Government,"I enjoyed the book very much. I gave it only four star since as an English only language person, I got confused by the multiple Arabic names and organization (give me only one star). Some charts along the way would have been helpful. The competition and lack of cooperation amoung the various federal agencies, especially the FBI, is quite sad. I was working on an investigation with another federal agency, and I mentioned to that agent of speaking to the FBI concerning another case, and the lack cooperation by the FBI. He just laughed and said ""You went to the FBI, that was your first mistake."" It is said of Washington DC that information is power, and many people do not want to give up that power. Unfortunately, Americans die when that happens. Hopefully, if the lessons learn in this book are taken to heart fewer American will die in the future."
5,"amazing, astonishing, breathtaking!!!","This is by far the best book I have read in ages. I won't give you out anything of the story, you have to discover it for yourself. For one, this book contains phenomenal information, it would be a shame to bluntly give it out. Plus your perception of the book will vary according to your existing knowledge of middle-eastern and intern affairs.What I can tell you though is that as much as I was prepared to read anything about terrorism and islamic radicals, I was soooo surprised, so off my feet many times during the lecture.No matter what, you will learn A LOT through the life of this woman, and see the world under another perspective."
4,"Not easy to read, but necessary","This book is important for two reasons. First, it brings to light the intradepartmental struggles that hinder the war on terror. Perhaps these struggles will stop now that they can't be done in secret.The second, and most important reason is perfectly expressed by the author:""These mild-mannered, rich men, hiding behind the veil of charitable work, sitting in a fancy office in Virginia or a palace in Saudi Arabia while inciting jihad and paying for it - They are the face of the monster.It is about time that the US woke up to the threat that Saudi Arabia poses to our freedom and our safety."
1,An Egomaniac Who Can't Write A Coherent Sentence,"I am stunned by the number of good reviews this book got. The writing is so bad, when it isn't turning your stomach, it's laughable. As one reviewer says, this woman takes credit for just about every terrorist investigation post-9/11 and many other things as well (for eg a speech given by Bush in the Rose Garden). It's quite bizarre. At one point she actually says that Operation Greenquest needed her because she knows how to analyze public documents and they don't. This woman is not an ""expert"" in anything. In fact, in the one terrorism trial where she was allowed to testify (the government lost), she was not allowed to testify as an expert. I could go on but I don't want to bore you. If you've already read this book, you've suffered enough of that and if you're planning to buy it, you have plenty of boredom in your future."
4,Insightful,"There are two sides to this book - the author's personal story and a factual account of the fight against terrorism.The author's personal story is quite interesting...definitely a good read here.The factual accounts of the fight against terrorism is mixed...at times it is incredibly interesting and truly draws the reader in. Not only is it fascinating to learn about the inner workings of the country's many security agencies...but it is also quite appalling to learn just how poorly coordinated the entire effort is. On the downside, these accounts often went into great detail, for several pages at a time...and while this is an area of interest for me, I found myself skimming ahead as some of the accounts do become rather dull.Overall, an excellent book for someone who's really interested in the subject. For someone who's only moderately curious though - I would suggest finding something else."
4,Great adventure,"I love historical military fiction. Although I'm more interested in novels about recent history like THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, or FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, a friend recommended the Kent novels, which I began reading with SLOOP OF WAR. It was fascinating, a vivid trip back in time to the days of the great Men-of-war of the Royal Navy."
5,JCrowe book raven,"One of my favorite early Kent novels about Bolitho. Good description of sea battles and interesting side adventures of historical interest. This novel and "" To Glory We Steer "" provide a since of the period and life as a sailor in the English navy. I plan to purchase all the Kent series by this publisher to complete my collection."
2,Strange Eroticism,"Spirits of the past with sexual appetites want to pass over. Trapped on the property of a former whorehouse. Erotic writing was a little on the SM side, and conversations/personalities in the story were not very believable."
1,"Prone to just ""dying""","I'm on my third one, and this one just died. I seriously don't mistreat them at all, I even keep it in a hardshell case when travelling. But invariably, every six months, it goes dead, I call Pentax, they take it in, send it back to me with ""a board replaced"" and I wait six months for it to die. If it wasn't for the chronic death syndrome - it's be a great 4 star camera - it's fairly quick, has a good flash, good depth of field and really great image quality. But i'm tired of returning for repair."
5,Rocky Falls Tunnel,I really like it. It makes nature sounds and train sounds. It really adds to the atmosphere of the train set.
3,Relive the 80's,"These shoes took a time warp out of the 80's. Since i like and dislike some stuff about the 80's mainly the clothing i gave this 3 stars.If you want to look ahead of the game in style in Germany, which is stuck in the 80's, buy these shoes and be adored buy the germans. (i just went to germany and the majority of the country is stuck in the 80's and just beginning 90's styles)"
2,Vans Skate Shoes...,"I'm a skater, I know good shoes from bad shoes...The Vans Classic B/W Checkered Slip-Ons are great shoes. With normal shoes, you spend about a minute putting them on, with these shoes, you spend a couple of seconds, plus the fact that they are really good for skating."
4,Great for younger kids,"We purchased this for our children to view as a group, but my four year old was the only one who stayed interested. The story is really good, the characters are entertaining and the music is awesome. I think the bloopers are hilarious and Kurt Warner's little girl as narrator is the star of the show. I would recommend this to all- just be advised it is more suited to younger children."
4,Good,This is a short movie but I love the storyline and the morals it teaches. There is also a really cool bonus feature on how the cartoon was made featuring Kurt Warners daughter.
2,TOO SHORT,"Being that there is only one episode on the DVD, my 4 yr old son thought it was too short. They should combine both episodes on one DVD to make it worth the price."
4,good book,for those enrolled in programs dealing with communication andmanaging risk and how to respond. Worthwhile reading and good reference book
3,"Decent, but obvious content","Clearly written, but obvious content. Nothing that most people don't know, in my opionion. Possibly useful as a first year University text. Includes basic exercises to practice and learn."
3,It's a history thang!,"This CD blows in comparison to Yngwie's best work but it's more of a historical document of where Yngwie was coming from in his teens.The guy was 16 or 17 years old and of course the production is bad and the playing is nowhere near the caliber that we now expect.I challenge any of the Steve Vai's or Satriani's of the world to put out their teenaged demos and display such conceptualization, vision, and facility on the instrument that would later create an entire genre of music.Anyone who whines about this disc, I ask you, ""What musical vision did you create when you were 16?""Yngwie had a dream, believed in it, and pursued his vision with steadfast decisive execution of a plan. A lesson for us all."
3,"Sounds stupid to me, but the boy loves it!","This is the kind of toy that if test-marketed to adults or older kids would've never taken off, but my son finds it entertaining. he will play with these Aquadoodle mats for at least a half-hour sometimes. Usually he flits around the house destroying things so anything that makes him sit still for a while is a pretty good toy."
2,Lame and overpriced,Mildly amusing to my 2-year old. But the colors are faint and can be seen w/out using the pen. WAY to expensive for what it is.
2,not good,"It is a bad book.I dont like it. May be it is good for those who are interested in the former USSR, BUT NOT FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO READ IT FOR ENJOYMENT.SO : IT IS A GOOD BOOK BUT A BAD NOVEL ."
2,I don't like it,The toy is well made however it will not go straight only in circles and my 4 year old son quickly loses interest. I am sorry I bought it.
2,Not worth it.,"My 3.5 year old loves space / solar + science. First thing he said is, ""How does it fly?"" He plays with it on rare occasion. It's just OK quality and its best feature is that it spins really fast in a circle. Not many choices for kids who are into space :-("
2,I guess it works But it sure takes a lot of space,This thing works I suppose. it isn't going to stop your Wii from freezing though so don't buy it for that reason. the fan isn't very big basically what is already in the wii. It is incredibly noisy. and It take up both USB ports so if you have a remote charger and that new game skylanders your screwed for ports. I was not happy with this item.
5,Beautiful piece of art!,This tapestry was truly beautiful. It also shipped right away and came faster than I expected. I will certainly buy from this seller again in the future!
5,Powerful book on appropriating the Power of God,"If you are a Christian who has longed to see the power of God demonstrated in his life, please read this book. As Believers, we tend to look at the working of the Holy Spirit through denominational glasses. This book simply tells the transformation of 20 simple Believers into dynamic, world-changing, Holy Spirit empowered men of God. I had been a Believer 18 years when I read this book. It started me on a Spiritual journey that radically changed my life. That was 38 years ago. The ""radical change"" gave me an insatiable hunger for God's Word, the Holy Bible, a discipline to spend devotional time with God in Prayer every day, a minute by minute walk with Jesus Christ, and a great joy in sharing the Gospel with others.I thank God for this book and V. Raymond Edman."
2,Only time will tell...,"The camera is priced right, no doubt. But there is one thing about it that makes it not quite the bargain that it seems to be.This camera lacks an internal memory. The Bushnell packaging and their web site mention that this camera has an SD card slot. What this does not tell you is that an SD card is necessary to enable the camera to function. So, you pay for the camera, then you have to get one or more SD cards for it and a card reader, if you don't already have these items.As far as the quality of the photos you are going to get from this unit, I don't know yet. I haven't had it out long enough to know. But don't buy this camera thinking it is going to work for you out of the box if you don't already have an SD card to put in it.I do like the password feature. Once you set the password, you have to type it in to make the camera work. That's a theft preventive!"
2,Not a strong magnet.,"This is ok for very thin, lightweight necklaces. The magnet is just not strong enough to trust with real or heavy custom jewelry. Very pretty and shiny but when you need a secure clasp, try the Clever Clasp ( As Seen On TV) right here on Amazon. I can't find it in stores. It has a strong magnet and a locking feature which twists on and off easily. I've tried them all as I am converting all my mom's necklaces for ease of use. It's more expensive, but you won't lose that favorite necklace."
2,Definitely not as strong as they imply,"As others have said, these are only really good for very lightweight jewelery like a thin chain, as the magnet isn't very strong at all. All it takes is a light touch to detach the clasp, so it's generally not good for bracelets or anything else that'll be moving about or brushing against things.Since the description claims ""These hold as securely as any normal type of clasp"" and ""The magnets are so strong..."" it's difficult to not let this shortcoming weigh heavily on the review."
1,Have to use jeweler,"Others I bought had a clasp you could hook yourself. With these, you would need to get jeweler or someone to install. Not very user friendly. Keep looking."
1,I only got 11.5 clasps!,"The clasps look great, but I didnt get all twelve clasps that I paid for. Instead, I got eleven clasps and one side of another one! What am I supposed to do with one side of a clasp? Also, the magnets on the clasps are not very strong, making them ffairly impractical."
2,Where is the sound?,"I purchased this item based on the description that included the phrase ""with sound,"" assuming that it would make an elephant like noise, but I can find no evidence that it will produce any sound. The marketing misrepresented the product. I might have purchased the elephant anyway at a lower price, but I am unhappy that the sellers were able to mislead me in this way and that I paid more for it than I would have if I had known it was just a stuffed elephant."
2,Too Slick,"Forro with cheesy production, but decent singing. Brazil Classics Forro on Luaka Bop is a much better place to start. I recommend cheking out videos by Jackson Do Pandeiro (Morena Bela), Os 3 Do Nordeste (E Proibido Cochilar) and Luiz Gonzaga (O Fole Roncou) to hear the best from this genre."
2,misleading and vague,"As a male, I purchased this book because I wanted to learn how to write very good erotica instead of porn. I was very disappointed in that the material in how to write erotica was limited.Subjects like publishing your story, finding an editor, and the history of erotica were covered well. However, I felt that these topics were better suited for another book instead of one that's supposed to teach you how to write.A positive aspect was the writing exercises that the author proposed. They were fun to work with and gave me more insight into writing ""proper"" erotica.I feel that this book is good for those people who just want to know what is involved in writing erotica. However, if you want an instructional, in-depth book on how to actually write erotica, you should look elsewhere."
3,"Good, but I was hoping for more.","The book contained lots of good ideas, but I would have preferred to see a bit more substance than just stories about the author's life. Still, reading about what she went through to get established in the industry was interesting."
4,More a generic book on writing that the title would suggest,"I'm a thriller writer. Sex scenes are virtually required by the industry to give the novel some ""juice"". Sex scenes are about the toughest thing to write, because sexual descriptions are either too weak, too trivial, too grotesque and above all cliched. Balance is hard. I thought that Susie Bright's book might give me some useful technique in addressing these problems. Instead I found a generic writing book discussing writers block, publishers and agents, and such. Not as much on writing technique, although there are numerous very interesting writing exercises that are helpful. It wasn't quite what I was looking for, but it does give lots of encouragement to someone who is thinking about becoming an erotic writer."
2,Not even close to what i hoped it would be,"The first 100 pages or so are about the history of erotica and the evolution of a sexual revolution from the female perspective. the next 65 pages are supposed to be about writing erotica, but it is mostly filler. There are maybe five pages with anything useful on them. The last 100 or so pages is by far the most usefull, but has nothing to do with writing dirty stories. It is about the realities of the publishing world. I bought this hoping to improve my writing, but found nothing that anyone with a brain would not already know. I also thought it was quite funny that the author confesses to being a socialist, and then devotes the last third of the book to how to succeed in the marketplace. Maybe it is just me, but that's funny. I actually regret that the author will get a royalty payment for my purchase."
4,Suzie Bright's Tricks of the Trade,"Usually with books on writing, I only find some information in them I can use. I was able to pull some things from this book that I found very helpful in improving love scenes in my writing. Love scenes for the romance genre are probably the most difficult scenes for any writer to write well. You have to include really good conflict, you have to write sensations and feelings in a very strong and unique way and of course the loves scenes have to move the plot forward. I found the characters splits exercise in the chapter on sexual characters very helpful to my writing and also I found the climax chapter helpful."
2,Has she ever written any erotica?,"I find it interesting that the same woman who makes money off the writing of talented erotica authors now offers advice on how to write erotica. From what frame of reference is she writing? This book might have credibility if it were written by someone who wrote from experience -- but once again, she's sponging off the work of others. Susie Bright DOES NOT WRITE EROTICA, she merely profits from it."
2,No depth,I thought this would be more instructive. Bright focuses too much on sexual politics and not enough on how to.
4,Perfect for the occasion....,Perfect for the occasion .... Came in a perfect case and was delivered on time ..
3,face is heavy,"I received this watch after having it on my wish list. I love the look of it and the style, but the face is strangely heavy and while wearing it, the watch shifts so the face is always hanging down. Other than that, I like it."
3,Don't read for surfing interest-read to learn about a junkie,"Hakman represents that great human irony where an extremely talented individual trashes everything in his life and yet, still becomes a multi-millionaire. This is about a man whose sole mantra for life is ME, ME, ME. Even this book represents that unextinguishable need to gratify himself. Except for his lame one-line apology in the very beginning, there is no apparent remorse for all the damage he did to his friends, lovers, family and all those who looked upon him as a role-model. When he was doing his speedballs, he had no thoughts whatsoever for the younger surfing crowd, people like Mark MacMillan who OD'd and died on the Big Island, that revered ""Mr. Sunset"" and emulated him to the the point of self-destruction. Don't read this book as a ""surfing book"" but as an edification to a junkie."
5,A Pleasant Surprise,Every athlete should watch this film. It is a cross of Rudy and all the right moves.The acting is superb and the storyline reminds me of my life growing up as a great athlete then learning when you get to college everybody is as good as you.
4,A Guilty Pleasure,"This book is like overdosing on fudge or Krispy Kremes-- a guilty pleasure but lots of fun. This is an improbable romance about a young upper-class Englishman who meets a mysterious woman at a Swiss resort. She turns out to be some sort of empress or queen of a mythical Slavic country, and they have a passionate romance, which ends when she leaves to return to her duty. However, Paul leaves her with a ""fair, rosy-cheeked, golden-haired English child."" The prose is purple, the plot far-fetched, and the characters unlikely--but it's a lot of fun. See where Barbara Cartland got her inspiration!"
3,"Racey, Racey, Racey","You must read this book with the knowledge of the date Miss Elinor wrote this book. Carry yourself back into time; read this book as you would read during her time period.This is a book best read in the quiet, undisturbed. Take the few hours, lock yourself away on a rainy day, or find a place of complete solitude and read Three Weeks. To much will be lost if you try to read it in any other way. Then find the book Lady by Thomas Tyron...."
2,Couldn't finish it.,"I was disappointed because I am a classic reader. I love Fitzgerald, Wharton, but I guess Glyn is not in the same category. But I was hoping she was like Anita Loos, I was sadly mistaken."
3,Interesting Story,It was popular during the Downton Abbey era! Interesting for the late 1910's to early 1920's. I'll read it again.
1,A Disappointment,"I've enjoyed other RAH works, especially Starship Troopers. But this book is really quite boring, and I had to stop reading about 1/3 of the way through. It's really disappointing, considering the concept is so interesting and influential."
1,trash utter trash,"I was very fond on this author before this. I noticed some of this leaking through before this. I would not have minded so very much except he makes me feel like I am the one who is sick not him. What the devil got into this old reprobate? He had a shot at the big time here, he blew it, you would think someone who lived as long as lazarus or heinlein would know better. Far from his best, this is ghastly.Incest indeed,how horrible. What an awful concept in book form or reality"
1,a book the whole family can enjoy *snicker*,"This book is about a 2356 year old man who becomes so bored with life, that he travels backward in time and %&#@s his mother.The main character is like a cross between someone out of a 50's western flick and Atlas Shrugged. The editing and continuity is nonexistent. The dialogue is meant to be cute and witty, but sound like no conversations I've ever heard. For writing something as grand as an apology for incest, the author spends very little time actually trying to convince the reader of the theme. The majority of the book is pillow talk and cheesy pet names, with a couple of chapters of random aphorisms thrown in the mix.In summary, there is nothing great, remarkable, fascinating, imaginative, or even interesting about this work."
5,Heinlein at his best,"A great follow up to ""The Past Through Tomorrow"" and lead in to ""Number of the Beast"". An Excellent read."
5,"Arguably, Heinlein's best work.","This book contains several stories within the story. No way you'll get bored. Yes it's long, but not boring. It's a page turner ... one you'll want to stay up and finish reading in one night. If you are a Heinlein fan, this book is an obvious must. It is the story of the thousand-year long life of Lazarus Long, the reminiscences of a guy who's ""seen it all."" Trust me, he's seen some very interesting things!"
1,Dafuq did I just read?,"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend. I would have titled it ""Time Enough to Tell You About All of the Incestuous Relationships I've Been Involved In"" because that's basically all it is. It may be entirely possible that the only thing Lazarus Long never tried was some restraint. Truly a one-dimensional character without charm or dignity."
3,A very incomplete edition,This is the most frustrating Kindle boook I have read. There are many omissions some of which are up to 10000 words. Dont buy it.
3,One of Heinlein's better ~ not best ~ books.,"Story of Lazarus Long, the mutant member of the Howard Families, the longest-lived man ever, the opener of the universe to mankind. Really about three or four plots in one novel (Heinlein was never loath to add a few thousand words to his tales); the outer plot is ~ nearly ~ just a convention to give shape to a series of short stories. Several of those short stories could easily have stood on their own ~ The Man Who Was Too Lazy To Fail, The Story Of 'Dorable Dora, for example ~ in fact, might have been better that way. The characters are both likeable and obnoxious; the views of Long are very closely those of Heinlein, as far as can be told, and are, as Heinlein's, not especially attractive to me. Nevertheless, he's an amusing rascal inhabiting a fun book."
5,TEFL is both wisdom and poetry!,"I first read Time Enough For Love as a teenager, and loved it instantly. The humor, the wisdom and the sheer intelligence of Lazarus Long was something I had never met before. It helped me shape my dreams, and gave me a measure-stick to use on all other science fiction-books. It mixed so many styles, but what struck me the most was the poetry. Just read the first page in the chapter 'The Tale of the Adopted Daughter' out loud and see what I mean! This is a book that will live for ever, being read and reread by thousands of science fiction-fans. If you like the book, continue with 'To Sail Beyond the Sunset' that one is just as brilliant!!"
5,Heinlein spins gold in Time Enough for Love.,"Some books tell a story. This one tells a way of life. After I read this book, I found myself wishing that I was actually a part of this world. I love the society Heinlein has created, and I see myself in his version of the future. Heinlein has the power to: A) give fictional characters more personality than most people I know, and B) Weave an amazing plot around these characters. Believe me, you will love the people he creates, and, in what is perhaps the greater feat, you will love the stage he sets for his characters. A living, breathing world with living, breathing characters. Heinlein creates this in every book, but in my opinion, he does it best in Time Enough for Love."
1,Book is great; Kindle version is not,Is this the quality level that Kindle and Amazon are to be known for? This was OCR'd in and spell checked - that's it. It's disappointing to have to put up with all the mistakes. Why wasn't this proof read?
4,"Epic, Sci-fi romance","Yes, this book has some issues, and could defintley have been whittled down some, HOWEVER, and this is a big however, there are moments in this book where fabulous and creative scifi is seamlessly blended with epic romance on a scale and to a depth that few writer ever achieve, and for Heinlein fans, a level he never achieves again. One thing I would have to say - this is all Heinlein - so yes, if you don't like this, you won't like his other work."
2,Several Very Good Novellas Buried in a Much Longer Work,"Time Enough for Love, the capstone of Heinlein's future histories, is a frustrating work. Buried in this book are a couple of the better bits of short fiction Heinlein ever produced, such as ""The Tale of the Adopted Daughter."" But the novel as a whole is far too long. Like most Heinlein books after 1960, it is drastically in need of an editor."
3,disappointed,"I have to say, I picked this up and just couldn't slog through it. I'm a huge Heinlein fan, but I really don't think this is up there with his best work. Too often it sounds like the ramblings of an old man. Maybe I just didn't have the stamina and it improves after the first few hundred pages. But there was nothing I read that heinlein didn't tackle in more interesting and coherent ways in his other books."
1,I thought better of Robert Heinlien,"The story is mostly (but not all) about beautiful women who want to be screwed (to have a baby) by a 2,500 year old man. He screws his sisters, his mother, and just about everybody. In his day and age, this is O.K. Most of the story is to justify this."
4,Rub her feet,"I rather wish that, like Mr. Scott, I had read this novel when I was ten! My life might have been more interesting. Suffice it to say that the moral structure (or lack thereof?) Lazarus Long operates in has contributed to my outlook on life a great deal. I found the book altogether liberating for reasons I won't give away here. My only criticism is that the overly egregious sexuality of the later chapters seems like a self-indulgence on the author's part. But maybe I'm just being a prude. Clear away some free time, read this book, and decide for yourself. The between-chapter sayings alone are worth the price of admission."
4,One of my favorites,"If you like Heinlein's style you will like this book. If the notion of a writer promoting his crotchety, cranky, yet wise ideas in his work bothers you, you won't like it. But for those of us who love this man's work, this book is a treasure. I would rank this his third best work, with Stranger in a Strange Land being #1, and To Sail Beyond the Sunset as #2. Lazarus and Maureen Long are old friends of mine. Every once in a while I pick up these books just to see how they are doing. And they are always just fine."
3,Good book. Bad editing.,"The kindle version of this book is a bad OCR job followed by no editing. I can't imagine a publisher with so little pride in their product. Two hours of editing could have cleaned up all the egregious, nonsensical errors."
5,My favorite book EVER!,"Time Enough For Love is the culmination of Heinlein's 'Future History' stories. It also happens to be the book that I read most often, and having worn out 6 hardcover books and numerous paperbacks, since first reading in 1976.It is a wonderful sci-fi love story, with the main character, Lazarus Long, having the longest love affair with life than any other human could. Lazarus is an old scalawag who delights in breaking all the rules as he explores all that space and new planets have to offer.May you live as long as you want, and love as long as you live."
5,"Long novel, short review","Other reviewers provide deeper analysis, but I'd just like to say that this book is probably my favorite novel of all time. I believe the ideas laid out in this book probably changed my life. And I'm proud to boast that I now own the painting by Carl Lundgren that was used as the cover art to the Berkley and Ace editions from the 1980s. Yes, I was so obsessed by this book that I eventually tracked down the artist and bought the cover art!"
2,"Not recommended, even to Heinlein fans","RAH is responsible for some of the best and worst science fiction even written. This book is close to the bottom. Although Lazarus Long is a somewhat likeable character, the novel has little plot and eventually devolves into a deviant sexual fantasy. I'm embarassed for RAH and those who rave about this book."
4,gr8 fun!!,"The book is gr8 fun, of a guy in year 4 thousand and sth, trying to give a description of our world today, sarcastic, hilarious, but also kiind of tragic. Wil surely read more of this author, for example ""Stranger in a Strange Land""."
3,Super Reader,"Lazarus Long is one of the Howards, a group of people that have extremely long life, basically due to genetics and being mutants, etc.Lazarus Long is well into this third millenium, and is looking back on his life to that some of the information and insights he has can be used. Long himself is most definitely a dodgy bloke, and a 'villain' in the pommie sense."
3,"Not Heinlein's best, too long and boring","I've read most everything Heinlein wrote, and of what I remember well, I've liked most of it. Time Enough for Love though is boring and for me, was unfinishable. The back cover of the edition I have states it is his ""longest and most ambitious."" Well, in this case, length isn't a strength. In fact, even in Stranger in a Strange Land (Heinlein's greatest story and arguably the best SciFi story ever), the story loses its way 1/2 way through. Shorter would have been better in both cases.True scifi and Heinlein fans will need to read this anyway. I'd suggest a steady diet of caffeine to make your way through it."
3,Book is great; Kindle version is not,"I've read this many a time in print form, and enjoyed it more each time. This Kindle version, however, is so rife with typos that it makes me feel like someone just OCRed it and didn't edit. Hopefully a revision is in the works, as it's jarring."
5,What more do you want?,"Many people dislike this book. Heinlein rambles, he tells a series of stories with an overarching story tying them together and the book has several hundred pages of conversation between characters that love to use pet names for each other. The book ask that you come to love the main characters despite (perhaps even because of) their willingness to violate the most basic taboos known to man and well suffice it to say that this book contains a lot of things people hate to see in a book. None of that matters. If you are the sort of person that doesn't mind reading a long book, believes that social conventions are not laws of nature, and is empathetic, you will be deeply moved by Time Enough for Love."
1,"Maybe he had time enough for love.,,,","Just not time enough to write a decent novel. I am a big Heinlein fan, but this is one of the novels I wished I had skipped.Heinlein seemed to be more interested in shocking his readers than he was in crafting a decent novel."
4,"REX, Where Are You?","This is a pretty good compilation with some new acustic versions of Whitecross clasic songs; however, Whitecross wasn't the same after Rex Caroll (guitar) left the band. The guitarist who replaced Rex, Barry Graul, did a good job in ""Equilibrium."" But their last guitarist, Quinton Gibson, forgot what Whitecross was all about. The good times where when Rex was around and play his guitar on albums like ""Triumphant Return"" and ""In The Kingdom."" With Quiton Gibson Withecross lost its identity and style. ""One More Encore"" is a good compilation, but I will have to give it 4 stars because it just has song since 1994 (whitout Rex) and only one from 1991. Since Rex left, Whitecross coudn't get another hit album like ""In The Kingdom."" Rex, Where are you? Please come back!"
3,I LOVE OLGA... BUT STICK TO MERENGUE ONLY.,"I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF OLGA TANON FOR A WHILE NOW. BUT I AM NOT CRAZY ABOUT HER POP EFFORT, HERE ARE THOSE POP ALBUMS #1 NUEVOS SENDEROS *1996 #2 TE ACORDARAS DE MI *1998 #3 SOBREVIVIR *2002. I WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THESE ALBUMS.

3,Not for beginners,"This video is good if you already have common knowledge on how to play the banjo, but if your just starting and have never picked a banjo up, I would consider trying something else. He goes through the basics, but he goes through them rather quickly and it doesn't give you a real chance to see or learn what he is doing. He also likes to show off in the video. After he instructs at a slow speed, he shows off and plays the whole song at normal speed, knowing that you can't keep up."
3,Micky Dolenz of the Monkees,"Night of the Strangler (1972) centers around a white girl who falls in love with and gets pregnant by a black man. When the two are mysteriously killed, the investigation focuses on the girl's two brothers, Vance, who is kind and was supportive of his sister, and Dan, an arrogant racist who would rather have seen his sister have an abortion than have a black man's baby. A black priest who tries to console the two brothers throughout the film also adds to the increasingly obvious tension.Night of the Strangler is pretty low-budget but has a good (and, for 1972, very controversial) plot. low-budget horror viewing for chilling lovers."
5,Schisms,"I was searching for this episode for over a year. ""Askme.com"" gave me the title/episode number, and ""Amazon.com"" to purchase it. This was one of my favorite ""Trek/NG"". It was a haunting episode which I thoroughly enjoyed, and I've been around since Kirk. It's worthy of any collection."
2,"one of the dumbest, most pointless STTNG episodes","This episode is a rather pointless exploration of alien abduction theories. All the suspense is contrived, and the episode never really goes anywhere, nor does it do anyhting experimental. It just sets up a situation, never resolves it, and never goes back to it later in the series. For UFO conspiracy buffs only, unless you're a completist."
1,Couldn't even finish....,Oh my gosh.... I couldn't go any further than chapter 3 on this one! This book could have been cut down to one chapter-but is 231 page's of b*tchin'. I'd think that these guy's had there nagging wive's write it for them! I'm glad it was only a $1.
1,Need Some Cheese to go Along with this Whine...,"The concept for this book was a good one, and there are certainly things which need to fixed with the game of hockey, but this book comes across as nothing more than a rant which has no basis in reality or common sense. Sure some of the new uniforms are ugly...is that really one of the biggest problems of the game? Organized protests by the fans at NHL games? Riiiight.This book does make some good points, but too bad they are lost under the complaining tone of the book."
3,not what I thought it would be.,The stand is not as tall as I wished. And the gold metal around globe is flaking off in one small area. Dose not look as nice as in picture. . Will be sending back so to get a differant one.
4,worth the read,Wonderful overview of these two west African countries. I am novice traveler to this continent and very much geographically challenged. Book referenced several other interesting books to read.
4,Senegal and Gambia,"I had to do a project on Senegal. And this book helped me a lot, even though I'd like most of the information to be on Senegal instead of Gambia. The book will really help you if you are a traveller going to one of the countries. The part about pickpockets was very interesting as it tells me about the best way to be robbed in Senegal. Overall, this book covers everything, from local slangs to foods eaten. It deserves a four star!"
4,Funny and Realistic Look at Childbirth,"Bleidner has put together a funny and realistic look at the process of childbirth, blending true stories of twists and turns of having a baby with a hilarious sense of humor. Most of these stories are laugh out loud funny and many tug at the heartstrings as well. Any mother about to give birth or who has already done so will identify with a good many of these stories. My only dislike was the addition of the celebrities' stories because most added very little to the cohesiveness of the tales and weren't very interesting to boot. But overall, this is a fun book which should bring a smile to the face of mothers everywhere."
2,Spoty at best,"I am a CS student looking to do some GUI programing.The first 1/4 of the book is just basic brush up on simple c++ classes,strings, declaring variables, pointers,etc. Nice little refresher. Then it gets into pop up windows which was informative but very limited . Then the remander of the book is focused around one program that he wrote as an example but his descriptions are so vague it is dificult to apply it to your own program. The things done in the book can just as easily be done by following the MFC app wizard in visualc++ and then reading the MSDN library, save your money, or buy my copy used =)"
2,Title suggests more than contents of book,"The one thing that you're not going to do at the end of this book is actually understanding MFC. It will give you a crash course in how to write an MFC program, and that's where it stops. Deeper understanding of how and why things work the way they work is not explained.Most of the book is based on one example, so if you skip a chapter you're doomed because your sample project isn't up to date. I wouldn't recommend buying this book."
4,Nice carrier to build.,Even two decks included in case something wrong with one!Simple construction to follow.Should be better packed.Good price!
3,OK for the money,"I am new to the plastic cut and glue model building world. I used to build model by cutting wood and wire while looking at a picture. This is my 8th model in the recent weeks.Revell seems to be the least expensive in more than one sense. Model kits from all other makers (Tamiya, Academic, etc) have been better, and slightly more expensive.This particular model was poorly made - the connecting parts between pieces are uneven and often times too thick, the holes are not cut through when should and not cut in shape as described. The manual is typical Revell - lacking in detail and precision. And most of all, the size is much smaller than expected.However I have yet to find a affordable alternative for this particular ship."
3,Pretty Good but better for younger kids,I teach 7th grade Social Studies and bought this book for my classes. It turns out most of the projects really didn't work for my classes but it got me brainstorming and with a few modifications I hope to use the book next year. If you teach elementary school kids this book would be perfect as it is written. If you teach middle school then you might have to change the projects a little bit which creates more work for an already overworked teacher.
5,fun social studies activities,"This book is great fun for my daughter, it has wonderful activities to do, but you're learning while you do them."
1,Beatle Mania fuels World hate campaign,"I would just like to say that in todays world of postmodern, post enlightenment, post punk, postmortem wolly headedness, it is refreshing to read a throughly modern logically precise and totally believable account of the beginings of all things. To get the whole truth and nothing but the truth into such a small book is a wonderous acheievement. The author must be conmended for their deep comprehension of the true nature of reality and their comitment to sharing this ultimate knowing with the rest of humble humanity. I can only say that it through this kind of supreme effort that the world in which we live is in such a conceptual mess. Yours insincerely Steve the Leggs"
3,3.5 stars,"This book was decent - not great. The examples, in my opinion, were boring and tend to be the abstract kind. There were VERY few step-by-step instructions on how to do those paintings, and the caption underneath a picture would talk about 2 steps while the picture shows only 1 of those steps. So, as you can see, I found this book to be a bit frustrating. I gave it another 1/2 star just because it showed me how to paint an ocean scene."
1,Disappointed due to no support,"I purchased this camisole to wear under lower cut summer tops to help provide support for my mid section but with a quick try on, I could tell there was absolutely no support so I returned it."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought two of these camisoles. I wanted to have something to wear under slinky spring/summer shirts. I was very dissapointed. I am a plus size, and it did very little to smooth or slim. It is very tight across the chest, way too short and is cut too big under the arms. It is so short that it rides up with every movement. You spend all day trying to find a way to discretely pull it back down. In my opinion, it is going to be too short on anyone who is over 5'3. I am 5'6 and it barely reaches my waist.For the cost of the item, I expected a whole lot more. It is definitely not worth the money. If you are shorter and have very little to slim or smooth, it might work okay. This product is no miracle worker."
1,acoustic guitar soloing,Same thoughts as on his Finger picking Dvd. I am just not a fan of this guys teaching style....some good info but hard to grasp unless you pretty much already know how to do it. The videos seem to be very low budget and poorly produced..for my money...go with Pete Huttlinger or Stefen Grossman if you really want to learn from videos.
4,Good price for a 3M camera with 3x optical zoom,"I was comparing this camera to other major brand 3M cameras and decided to pick this one because it is good value for a compact camera with 3x optical zoom. Canon S230 is great but it only has 2x optical zoom. Sony P7 is great but it's a little long and thick. On top of that, both S230 and P7 are selling for a higher price.I've been using it a lot indoor and it has given good quality pictures at Normal setting. The shutter is a little slow but it's not a big deal to me after a little practice. I guess this is the only thing I'm not too happy with.In conclusion I'm satisfied with the overall quality and would recommend it."
2,terrible customer service,"although so far the product has been performing well, getting it connected to my computer and installed was a pain in the ass and the customer service was terrible. the harddrive didn't come very good directions and the website isn't very specific. also when i tried emailing them for help i had to wait a week before i got a reply and the reply told me to look at their website. eventually i had to figure it out with some help from friends. if you don't know much about computers, this is not the company to deal with."
4,Mounted On My Zodiac Outboard Motor,"When I venture out before sunrise in my Zodiac boat there is a need for a rear tail light. This light works great although, it has has turned off without being touched. I believe the switch is too sensitive and can turn off when vibrated. Great light output and I purchased the optional bracket to mount to the flat surface area on the rear of my outboard motor. The mount is more than adequate and I'm satisfied with the easy removal capability."
5,Bright light bright light,This thing is a little ball of brightness. Its bright and that is what you want. If someone doesn't see this light than they are blind.
5,Terrifyingly bright,"As everyone else has said, this thing is great. It's honestly an order of magnitude brighter than anything else out there, and the weird pattern of the two sets of LEDs makes it much more noticeable as well. You can definitely see this thing from hundreds of yards away even in full daylight.The only negative is you need to make sure you hear a click when sliding into the mount. It can look fully seated but vibrate out on rough roads otherwise. Once you hear the click, it stays in through anything."
5,Awesome Light,"This light is so bright and obnoxious that everyone notices it. We both ride Terratrike recumbent tadpoles and when my wife and I ride together whomever is in front has to turn their rear blinky light off. Talk about being in your face, This light is great! Traffic definately notices us!"
5,Great price for a great product,"I'm very happy with my purchase! Extremely bright, waterproof, durable, easy to use and easy to install."
2,"Very bright, but defective switch.","I've owned three, mounted on three different bikes. The first worked like a charm with never a problem. The other two worked fine also, until I really needed them. Moisture would shut them off leaving me caught in the rain with my taillight not working. Two days later when the switch dried out the light would be blinking in the garage. This happened on both the second and third lights. One is mounted on the wheel stay of my road bike, the other behind the headrest of my recumbent. I switched to Portland Design Danger Zone lights (uses same mounting bracket as Blinkey)on both those bikes and have had no problems since."
2,It bounced off!,"The removability is a nice idea, but mine bounced off the mount after just a few uses (and because I didn't notice it until the end of my 8-mile morning commute, I never found it again). Impressively bright, but if I get another -- and I may -- I'll zip-tie it down."
1,"Good visibility, poor durability","Beware of this light in extremely wet weather. I got caught in a very heavy extended downpour of rain and when I pulled off the road to seek shelter, I noticed that the light had packed up due to water obviously getting in through the supposed seal. Even after letting it dry out, it remained useless and I just threw it away and got a different brand. Waste of money and potentially dangerous as goodness knows how long I'd been riding before I'd noticed it had packed up."
5,Solid Light Weight Light,"I purchased this light along with a Portland Design Works Radbot and Planet Bike Helmet rear light. It's not as bright as the Radbot but works great along with it (different light phases & smaller/lighter). Overall, very happy with the light it's great for the price. Brighter than every light I've seen with the exception of the Radbot and pricey rechargeable lights."
3,Light popped apart while riding,"I really like this light (the one with the red lens, not the one that has a clear lens and flashes red LEDs). It's very bright. The blinks and strobes in a sequence which is very attention-getting.I read other reviews saying the light case can pop apart. That happened to me last night. I got home and all I had was the mounting bracket and rear (white) shell of the light. Batteries and light lens gone.It's seems like a bad design. Planet Bike products are warranteed for life of original owner. They say you're supposed to keep the receipt. I called PB this morning. They are mailing a replacement light. All they required was a photo (emailed) showing the remaining white case (proof).I guess you can't complain about a product the manufacturer will easily replace. But, it's a hassle to deal with."
4,Does the job,"I was riding this past winter in the rain and sleet (not quite the dark of night) when I joined up with a few guys (strength in numbers we suggested). At one spot on a narrow road with car traffic one of the guys suggested I go to the front, since my rear blinker wasn't really standing out. That alone made me consider getting a new blinker. Someone suggested this and I bought it that night.Wish I had done so years ago.10 second installation; worked exactly as you'd expect. I feel safer riding. In fact, I use the various blinky modes (there are 3) almost all the time. Even when it's not bad weather."
4,amazingly bright light,"I have had several rear lights for my bike over the years. However, this one really lives up to the advertising. The light is so bright it is hard to look at directly. In my basement with no lights on the light was so intense that I could walk around and easily find my way with the red light. The only draw back for me was that they don't include the mounting bracket for a pannier rack with the cost of the light. I think many people who invest in such a light would be mounting on panniers like I am and that extra bracket would make this a perfect 5 star product."
2,lasted about a month,"The light is bright, but has 2 major problems. 1) as stated in other reviews the switch is very poorly designed. Most of my low light riding is early spring and fall, when I often need full finger gloves. The switch is hard to use bare fingered, impossible with gloves on. It isn't really a switch, just a marked spot on the case. Which leads to, 2) I turned the light on yesterday when caught in light rain (wanted visibility), reached back to my bag and pressed the switch. Apparently that was enough to open the case, because when I went to turn it off after the rain, the light was gone, all that was left was the back and the clip. For $25 I expect much better."
1,Falls Apart,"I bought this tail light because I do a lot of early morning riding in the dark and I got a new bike so I wanted a good tail light. Trouble is, the light part of it fell out of the white casing somewhere on one of my 15 mile rides only about a month after I bought it. On my older bike, I have a cheap tail light that I bought at Wal Mart about 4 years ago. Never had a problem with that one. Makes me think I wasted my money on this supposedly much better light. It's not going to do me any good if it falls apart while I am riding. In fact, it can be dangerous. I think I have a light to make me visible to traffic behind me ... and I don't! Would not recommend this."
5,Warning:,"This F@%*ing thing is bright! They should sell this Planet Bike super flash with a welding mask! I need to brush up on my laws of electricity, 1/2 watt sounds like nothing. Holy smokes! If someone can't see you while you are riding with this thing, its because they're Stevie Wonder, I mean really, this thing is why Stevie Wonder is blind. :D This will give you great visibility...not invincibility- wear a helmet."
4,Bright light,"This light works really well at night, and I'm impressed with how well it works during the day. Dusk is when it does the most good.Comparing it to my old taillight, well, there's no comparison. I'm not sure how I thought the old one made me any safer or more visible.The only problem I had was that the front piece popped off while it was on the front of the bus on the interstate. Planet Bike quickly sent me a replacement under warranty, and I simply added a zip-tie around it to make sure I don't lose it again."
5,The best light,"I ordered 2 of these lights and they work great. They are extremely bright and very small. They come with a seat post mount and the light it self has a slide on type mount. The two mounts work together, so you can slide the light on and off your bike at will and also you are able to attach the light to anything using the slide on mount. Things like your backpack, your pocket or anything with a thin edge.This has to be the best rear bike light out there right now."
4,bright,I have owned many different brands of tail lights. most work fine at night. this one is visable in the daytine..
5,Very good back light for bike.,"I have to say after reading all the other reviews, this light is a very bright led light and works very well when attached to the back on my bike frame. Now I won't need to worry if people driving behind me can see me or not, so very good for safety."
5,Fantastic taillight--there is only one better,"I recently purchased the Superflash, and I am highly impressed. The light has three LEDs---one .5 watt LED and two regular blinky LEDs. This light is so bright it's painful to look at in the daytime. Two modes are available---flash and steady. The flash setting is supposed to give 100 hours of use, which is comparable to other taillights. The only light I can imagine being better than this one is the DiNotte taillight, which is a 5W LED detuned to 3W. It's also 120 bucks or so. I don't think you can go wrong with the Planet Bike Superflash. The only thing I would change is the length of the clip. I attach the light to my Topeak rack trunk, and the clip is barely long enough to go through the mounting strap. Not a big deal. Great light, can't beat it for the price."
4,Planet Bike Blinky Super Flash,"This is an excellent, bright, easy to use, and reasonably priced light. My only complaint is that I wish its mounting options allowed it to be mounted to the rear rack on my commuting bike. However, I feel confident riding home in the dark with this flashing behind me."
1,Somewhat disappointed,"I know its only a blinking red tail light, but I'm really disappointed in two things: its not quite as bright as some other tail lights that Ive seen and probably more importantly, the on/off switch is almost impossible to work---it really takes a hard push in exactly the right place to turn the thing on or off. Might not seem like a big deal, but when you are riding and realize that you need to turn it on, because you forgot when you started the ride, you have to get off the bike and fiddle around with it. Just doesn't need to be that hard even it is just a stinking light."
5,Hard to find a better light for the price.,"This light will very likely meet or exceed most cyclists' needs and expectations. This thing is b-uh-right! Brighter than a lot of car tail lights and brake lights, and the flash pattern is very eye-catching. I recommend this light to everyone; you lose a lot of effectiveness and don't save much money by going with most anything cheaper, and you don't gain a whole lot by spending more. It's pretty much perfect for most uses. Only downside is it may be a little bright for the poor suckers behind you if you're riding with a group, but it's probably OK on steady mode. I have heard some issues a few people have had with the light falling off the bracket, but I've had no problems. Seems solid to me."
4,"Very good, could blink a little faster.","I like this light a lot, just wish that it would blink a little faster.But it is good for the price. I like the fact that it uses a common battery size."
3,"it is bright, but the switch location is odd","No need to say more about how good and bright the light is, did anyone else feel the switch location is odd to turn on and off each time?Each time, I have to feel down to push up with index finger to turn it on and turn it off the same odd, not easy way. i hope Planet will place the switch on the side for an easy access."
3,Only if you like inflicting seizures on the drivers behind you,"I bought this light before I really did the math. All the reviews here say it's great, but everyone seems to use it on flash mode, which I don't like. It's difficult for drivers to gauge the speed and distance of a frantically flashing and blinking light, which is why there are so many laws on the books all over the world banning the mode.So, this has a steady mode, but if I'm doing my math right, two 1000 mAh AA batteries can only light a half-watt LED for a shade over 6 hours. That's not bad, but I like my rear light to be my last resort light that almost never dies. Plus, most of the light is wasted on a very tight beam, making this just a 2-dollar, disposable tail light to any cars not directly behind you and the perfect distance back to be right where you've aimed the beam. I'm going to keep looking for something that will give me a long-lasting, steady glow."
5,Fantastic Visibility at Affordable Prices,"As small and easy to install as these lights are, I'm always amazed to view one from a distance and note how BRIGHT they are.Great value and performance, and fairly easy on the batteries."
5,Great light,This is a great light for the money. I finally decided to purchase after seeing many others using. It clips on to your saddle pack with ease and is within reach to switch on while riding. The light itself is very bright. Would definitely recommend.
5,Very bright,This is the best rear light I have had - and the smallest. On a recent early morning ride that started in the dark the rider behind me when it was light asked me to turn off the light because it is so distracting and bright. No need to spend money on anything more expensive. I can't change a light bulb at home but had no trouble mounting this just below my seat.
2,Bright light. insecure mounting,"This light has a very bright flash, but the mounting system is insecure and badly needs a redesign. The first time I used this light, I added some rubber bands to hold it more securely. The second time, I forgot the rubber bands, and the light bounced out of its mounting bracket somewhere on a stretch of rough road, and I lost it. There are other strobe lights that are every bit as bright as the Super Flash with a better mechanical design. Until Planet Bike redesigns the mounting bracket, I would give this light a pass."
4,Very bright -- you WILL be seen,"This small unit packs a punch in terms of brightness and it's flashing pattern. Combined, it ensures that you will definitely be seen by cars approaching you from behind. I consider it a must-have for riding at dusk or night. My only small annoyance was that it comes with a mount for the seat post and another small mount, but no bracket to mount it to the rear of a bike rack. With so many bikes now having racks installed, would have been nice if they threw that in. Instead, I had to buy the bracket for $5 from another source. Nonetheless, this is one of the brightest -- maybe the brightest -- rear bike light/flasher."
4,it is very blinky,"This seems like a pretty good light for the price. I've only used it a few times, and only in good weather, so i can't comment on water-resistance or long-term reliability. It seems decently built from the outside, at least.The brightness is medium-high. Not as ridiculously bright as many more expensive lights are, but it's as bright as or even brighter than you can possibly expect from one in this price range.As far as the visibility of the blinking mode, there is definitely zero chance that anyone could possibly argue that they hit you because they couldn't see you. However, they might get away with it if their defence was based on how incredibly obnoxious the blinking is to everyone around you..."
3,"Great Light, but can be had much cheaper.","This is a great taillight.Amazon unfortunately is selling this light at a ridiculously high price. It can be had for under $15 Canadian Dollars. I will not say from where, all you have to do is search the net for this light in Canada."
5,Wow! Super Bright!,I couldn't believe how bright this little unit is. It has a blinking and a steady mode. It's the brightest rear bike light I have ever seen and the price is incredible. Best bang for your buck!
5,Hands down one of the brightest taillights out there right now.,"This thing is bright and well built. I have not had any problems with it so far. Because of its brightness, I use it day and night and feel much safer with it."
2,Undersize bit,"This bit is about 3/64"" smaller than 3/4"", so dadoes routed with this bit are too small. The cutting edge is also duller than other bits in it's price range."
5,CMT Router Bit,What can you say? CMT makes one of the finest router bits in the world. This one is no exception. Extremely precise and extremely sharp. You'll never go wrong with CMT...
4,Halloween Fare and Old Fashioned Horror,"For librarians and teachers who want to put together a really creepy, scary program for Halloween, this is one of the books to use. But read it thoroughly first. It's not your typical Dickens fare. And it's not for the very young. Older kids will enjoy it and want to discuss it later. I would guess it would be best not to use it for kids under 5th or 6th grade."
2,movie is fine but the picture quality is awful,"If this DVD was purchased from anywhere else but a US seller, I would have said it was a poorly done pirate copy. The picture is worse than grainy, it is blotchy, the sound is extremely bad. Besides, the summary of the plot provided by Amazon is actually all wrong. Russel in this movie can not be Bronson's hero helper simply for the fact that in the movie he plays a boy of about 12-13 years! They are both much younger in the movie than the cover makes you think.The DVD that I got was only watchable till the middle of the movie, after that the picture started dissapearing or splittering on the screen. No idea if the problem was with that particular DVD or (which is a possibility) the whole batch was badly done from some old tape."
2,as good as it get for now,"slightly better than the other public domain releases & the letter boxing to 1.85:1 seems to be matted. Adequet release until a major studio decides to re - release it, which considering its star they should but doubtful."
3,Review of movie Guns of Diablo,"Just saw movie Guns of Diablo on AMC today, Aug 8m 2009I like it! What year was it made as Kurt Russell very young.........Like seeing him so young"
3,Does little to make sense of a confusing war,"I enjoy the Osprey Essential Histories and up until this one, I believe they were all well put together for the layman to understand. However, in this particular issue, the author does little to clear up background to the war as well as the major participants in the conflicts. Instead he leaves us with lists of major leaders and generals in which one would already have to have an in depth understanding of this era to recognize and understand. I have to say that this is perhaps the most confusing war I have ever read in terms of the various states and sub factions involved. I was hoping Osprey would be able to clear it up, but unfortunately it did not. Though still well written, it did little too help my understanding of this major political and religious struggle."
3,Two and a Half Stars,"I'd never seen Tosca before, and was expecting it to be as good as the hype. But it was not -- it was just barely okay. There's nothing I could recommend on this disk besides its Blu-ray video quality. However, I just watched Tosca with Placido Domingo and Raina Kabaivanska, and that version of Tosca was great! Those two singers were amazing! And the music was beautiful. And the setting and acting were just right. Tosca is as good as its hype on the right DVD..."
2,Plain Lousy Sound and Conductor,"This Blu-ray got great reviews.... I can't imagine why. For a Blu-ray the sound is lousy. The conductor begins the majestic opening as if he had a tooth-ache and needs to finish real fast so he can get to the dentist. Don't waste your time on this ""great"" performance -pass it up like the plague and get something else, anything else would be better."
4,Wonderful looking production with terrific singing.,"I have seen this opera several times, and own over 15 different dvd's of this as well. So, in this one, what particularly moved me? Taking in mind the huge setting in the Verona arena, I was surprised at how well this rather small scale opera worked in this vast space.The arena sits 15,000 people, so VERY large productions like Aida, Nabucco, etc, work especially well. Here, the ending of Act 1 (with the full church service) was spectacular, and looked even better on the Blu-Ray disc. THIS is really what the Verona arena is for. But the more intimate scenes of Act 2 still worked well for me, even with the large scale.Marcello Alavarez was terrific as Carravadosi, and all three major roles were well sung and acted.Finally, the video was excellent, I thought the sound was terrific as well.This opera is always a fun watch as it is so deliciously melodramatic."
3,OK but not outstanding production,"The Arena di Verona is a spectacular venue seating an audience of 15,000 but its open air situation makes any musical ambience near impossible. The orchestra is well recorded in DTS-HD audio but does sound flat because of this and the singers come through less intimately. The artistry is ok with Florenza Cedolins capturing a couple of nice moments in her role as Tosca but this traditional production is generally less than riveting. I feel there are better renditions of this opera to come on Blu Ray so this version cannot be enthusiastically recommended."
2,some thing is wrong,"i just got this in on friday and today is monday. i installed it correctly and put in in my truck. it ran well when i did a trial run. downloaded info to my comp and every thing was great. used it again the next day and said correct info on the way to my destination and the way back the time was off. miles drivin was only 3.5 and time about 10min and diconnected it at 2:55, but the carchip said disconected at 3:27 41 miles and time 55min. i didnt know what was going on so i de-installed and reinstalled the software. everything work correctly the way there at 41.6 miles and about 55min,connected at 11:15 and dis at 12:10. the info on the way back was same distance but chip said con. at 5:45 and disc. at 10:16 when it was supposed to be 6:30 and miles at 209???? so i will find out the return thing and see if i can get every thing worked out."
3,doesn't work with digital camera,"This tripod was listed as an accessory for the Kodak DC3200 digital camera but there is no linkage available on that camera to interface with the tripod (ie. no little hole to screw that attachment screw into). OK, I'm certainly not a photographer myself so I took the whole she-bang into work for the real photographers to explain to me. Shaking their heads, they told me ""hey, this tripod won't work with this camera"". So, I guess I'm not as dumb as I look (weak grin). Anyway, make sure the camera you have has what it takes to hook up with a tripod cuz the recommendations page doesn't necessarily take this into consideration. I can use the tripod with a couple rubber bands around the camera but this certainly wan't my intention."
1,EXTREMELY POOR DIGITAL TRANSFER TO DVD! What an insult!,"This is an excellent game, and when it got transferred to DVD, it seems like SOMEONE in Marketing thought it'd be a cool idea to cram THE WHOLE GAME on one disc to save money. The problem is, when you cram 4 hours of content on a single disc like that, you're going to have to lessen the quality of the video and maybe even the audio. And OH GOD, did they ever SCREW the video quality. It's pixellated GUTTER TRASH that completely insults this great game.You better hope that this DVD gets re-released in a 2 or 3-dvd box set, because this is a slap in the face. They kicked us down and spit on us. Do NOT buy this DVD, and make sure ""DVD Marketing (oh, that's a good one), Inc.) knows that this is UNACCEPTABLE."
2,Horrible Video,"The game is 5 of 5 stars. The video is below par. I too saw this in HD and I would have paid double to have it on bluray format. The best game of all time and it was sold in a grainy, 480p, 4:3, 1989, VHS lookalike format ?? What a waste."
5,Greatest BCS Game so far.,"This dvd is a must have for all Texas Longhorns fans! Before I ordered this dvd, I was concerned, because the description said that the dvd is only 90 minutes long. Do not worry, because the entire game is on the dvd. It also has postgame interviews, but sometimes you can not hear the questions being asked. The special features are also good. The special features include interviews with Vince Young, his offensive lineman, and some game footage of Texas v.s. Ohio State, and Texas v.s. Oaklahoma. I hope this review helps you, big tex"
2,"Great game, but disappointed in DVD quality","I got this as soon as I could from Amazon, but I'm disappointed to report that this was a poor recording of the 2006 Rose Bowl game.First of all, it's in 4:3 fullscreen standard definition, which was hugely disappointing since I originally saw it in beautiful HD. I can't believe ABC couldn't spend enough to record this in widescreen.Even worse, it's a flaky standard definition recording. There are several instances of snow and blurry patches in the playback.Overall, I'm hugely disappointed that the game didn't get the first class DVD treatment it deserved."
2,"Seems awesome, BUT hold on!",It's great if you don't print much. Very quick & quiet. But the toner is twice as expense as my Brother 1250 printer. My Brother & my Samsung were printing side by side 2000 sheets. The Samsung jammed way too many times (50). The Brother 1250 jammed only a few times. The Brother toner cost less and lasted just as long. The Brother stops printing when low on toner. The samsung keeps printing faint copies and wasting paper. The duplex feature is great for a once and a while duplex operation. It's a lot of paper moving for anything over a couple of pages. My Brother 1250 & My Samsung blow away my HP Laserjet. The Laserjet is old but never made into the second cartridge before Goodwill got it. HP didn't even stand behind it. The said they would sell me the repair kit. Brother is a good printer.
4,Cutting edge cello--sometimes with the intensity of a chain saw,"This is not for the conservative listener, but it is some sharp cello playing. Tired on listening to Casals or Yo Yo Ma, then take a chance on hearing what the new generation of cellists is playing."
5,A beautiful second act,"Mona Ruiz is an inspiration, someone both young men and women can relate to, who sees herself and the world she lives in as honestly as possible. This book, written with reporter Greg Boucher, is actually the best written and most fairminded I have read about the gang lifestyle and someone who overcame great obstacles to turn her life around, ultimately using her former life as a gang banger to her advantage as a fine policewoman. I admire her and am happy for her as she continues to try to make her old barrio a better place. As a middle/high school librarian in a school with a number of students who are fascinated by gangs, I am delighted to have found this book and will recommend it to ALL our students. Be safe, Mona."
1,"Someone Help Me, Please!!!","I usually read a book in about two days, regardless of the story-line. It took me a week and a half to finish this book. I must say, it was absolutely awful. I was being used a gineau pig to read the book first. I gladly accepted my role, because I love to read. I was so upset with myself for even opening the book. It left a lot to be desired. It did not flow very well at all. I still don't even know what the book was about. It had too much going on. You couldn't even follow the story line. I hated it. I hated it."
2,Too Much Detailed Astrology,"For the lay person it was too much astrology, as well as, too scientific. Due to my personal lack of astrology I could not get in to it. When I was trying to get into the book, all of a sudden I got hit with more astrology, which turned me off. Although I did finish the book, it is not one that I would ever read again."
3,"A ""Sweet"" Read","Honestly when I first started reading Faraday's Popcorn Factory I just didn't get it, so I put the book away. On an unsually crisp, starry July night, I opened the window, lit some candles and sat down with a glass of herbal tea to try again. Half way through, the author's use of symbolism between the metaphyscial and the human world slowly began to become clear. I don't think it intended to be, but FPF is a ""new age"" romance. I enjoyed the lyrical images of its many characters which made the love between Willow and Clement very special. Borrow it from your local library and read it with an open mind."
2,Whatever!!!!,"This book was weird in my opinion. You never really know much about Clement because the author uses to many unnecessary words to make her point. I mean one would have to be in numerous fields of science to understand Clement. She beats around the bush too much. For some people that may be okay, but I'll have to pass."
2,"Model has almost no detail at all, price should be around $10.","This model lacks alot of detail. Compared to other U-Boat models I've built in the past, this one has only 6 steps to do where other models have about 30 steps to do. Everything about it is so easy, especially the conning tower. The conning tower for this model was finished in less than 5 minutes, where other model's conning tower take 10 minutes to complete. There are no rivets or welds on the hull and the conning tower was only the basic stuff, periscopes, hatch, and anti-aircraft gun. This model is not worth the money, and I suggest buying something else."
5,Simply Fantastic!,"This book is a wonderful collection of poems for children. I love the illustrations by Adrian Sinnott because they match the writing perfectly. They are silly, fun, and creative. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Shel Silverstien."
4,needs a better manual,"The collection includes Macromedia Flash MX, Dreamweaver MX, Fireworks MX, FreeHand, a developer edition of ColdFusion MX Server, they all work great. The only thing I dislike is it doesn't come with an complete manual for each program, only a small tutorial book. How could Macromedia expect us to learn without a detailed manual?"
3,"Just ""okay""","I'm not 100% thrilled with this product. My dog never used to care when I touched her paws but now that I tried to clip them, I think it splintered the nails which is making her very afraid. I think I leave the nail clipping to the groomer or vet."
1,Don't Buy This!,"I own a number of Safari brushes and combs. They are great. So, I figured this clipper would be equal in quality. Boy, was I wrong! This product is terrible! The first time I tried to use it, it did not cut completely through my dog's toenail. I had to tear it off the rest of the way. On the other nails, it left a very frayed edge. This nail clipper is total garbage. I immediately returned it."
