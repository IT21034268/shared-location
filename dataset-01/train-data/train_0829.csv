3,tight Vocals so-so Lyrics,Jaheim can Sing but this Song is Hit&Miss for Me.the Lyrics threw me off quite a bit but His Vocals were Right on!
4,A brave study!,"Joshua, The Man They Called Jesus, by Ian Jones is a brave study into the life of a man who is still, by and large, an enigma to many of us today. Ian Jones has done an indepth research of all four Gospels as well as Acts and very often quotes from The Gospel of Thomas, a Gospel that is still not accepted as authentic. I found his study of the Last Supper to be the most informative, though to be honest, in my case, it was a case of preaching to the converted. I have always found the concept of drinking the blood and eating the flesh of Jesus to be particularly barbaric and cannabilistic. For these views alone, he needs to be commended. For anyone in search of answers to the life and history of Jesus, I can highly recommend this book."
1,I expected more from this book,I expected more form this book. Its too small and too deja-vu. There is nothing outstanding on it.
5,A significant success,"Marshall Poe has achieved prominence as one of the finest empiricists studying early modern Russian history. In the current essay, weighing in at a mere one hundred and thirty breezy pages, Poe finds the seeds of the modern Russian crisis in the early modern period he knows so well. It is a fascinating premise which is certain to draw fire from many quarters. But what separates Poe's book from the myriad ""explanations"" of the demise of the Russian empire is that this meticulously crafted essay is the work of a first-rate (and sometimes brilliant) scholar. Highly recommended."
4,Cheap cotton means cheap clothing,"A quick glance at the title suggests something to do with the World Wide Web. But no! The book predates the Web by 12 years. Its Web is a metaphor of the textile makers who use cotton. It studies the makeup of companies throughout the world who dominate the purchasing of cotton, for clothing production.A serious tome that requires some economic background. Heavily documented with footnotes, to emphasise the depth of their research. Their basic message is that bargaining power rests in these makers, instead of in the often poor third world farmers.Current readers will see analogies with how WalMart now dominates its suppliers, or how coffee chains like Starbucks often have the upper hand over growers.But while the book decries the fate of the cotton farmers, it pays to attention to the worldwide benefit of cheap cotton. It has enabled many people, even in the third world, to have affordable clothing. A global social good."
3,It's okay...,"I've had the pendant for over a month now, and so far I haven't dealt with any discoloration; I also keep it on unless I'm going to take a shower. The pendant is exactly as you see it. The reason I only give this a 3-star rating is because one: for the price, I really expected more of the pendant itself. It is pretty thin and I thought there would be more weight in the silver. The second, the quality of the chain could have also been better. Again, for the price I was expecting better. I'm expecting to have to change the chain out for a more sturdy one in the near future."
3,Tarnishes Easily,"I have had this cross for about 2 weeks and its already turning black, given I don't take it off for anything but a shower, I expected a little better."
4,"""Higher and Higher"" offers great mix for J-pop lovers...","Da Pump burst onto the J-Pop scene with their catchy songs and energetic dance moves and have now become one of Japan's hottest male groups. Their sophomore album contains the same hip-hop dance numbers that made them popular, but their sound has come to take from reggae and R&B as well. Grooves like ""South Guys In Tokio"" and ""All Night Long"" have that soulful sound, whereas songs like ""Crazy Beat Goes On!"" and ""Joyful"" make you want to get up and dance. Writers/Producers m.c.a.t and Akio Togashi have created a sound infusing pop, rap, hip-hop, and R&B that have given Da Pump a more mature sound for their 2nd effort."
5,Excellent DVD,We love all the Homestead Blessings tapes. We are chrisian homeschool family and we like to purchase products that enhance the christian home. We have bought almost all of these tapes.
5,Great Holiday CD,"I am not a big fan of Country music but this Holiday CD is great. Garth's song is a little campy, but the rest are awesome. Highly recommended."
2,Little league,"I bought this book through the net based on the positive review given by the New York Times Book review. Had I seen it first, I might not have bought it. In spite of the fact that I was a fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s and that I like Carl Erskine, this book was a major disappointment. Pleasant, easy reading but shallow, superficial and providing neither interesting inside stories, insight into playing on one of baseball's best and most significant teams (i.e. Jackie Robinson) nor who Carl Erskine is. This is a light-weight book for killing time during a flight but not for learning anything about baseball. I knocked it off in two evenings - and can barely remember anything in it!"
5,I Remembered the day,Very enjoyable book. I was a Brooklyn Dodger fan until they went west. I remember all the players and a lot of the incidents
2,Disappointed,"This is a small book which will hold pictures, and could perhaps be made special by someone creative. It also gives space to tell what the couple did and how they reacted.I had intended it to go with Wedding Memories, but the binding is not as attractive."
1,Only received 2 items as well even though 50 was listed.,I only recieved 2 items as well even though 50 was listed. Even the packing list says 50 but only 2 discs arrived.
1,This is a mis-labeled item,You will not see 50 disks for this price. What you might receive is 2 disks. This listing is supposed to be removed
5,Great album,"A well recorded live album, but I still kinda like the raw, noisy sound of Press the Eject and Give me the Tape. I was at the show, and found the live sound better than reproduced on the discs. Some of their best songs performed well - a must for the Bauhaus fan. Go ahead - it's worth the money."
5,"Yes, its Goth, and yes, its brilliant.","I don't get the point of all you people saying that this isn't goth music. If My Dying Bride etc. don't sound like this then that means My Dying Bride ARE NOT GOTHS. They must be something else. Bauhaus more or less invented the genre, so get used to it. As for this, well it is spectacular. 20 years later and all the songs are played to perfection. As the man says, this is all we ever wanted. Pity they can't stay together long enough to do more new stuff."
3,Nice but does not last long at all.,"This is a very earthy smell of sandlewood and spice. I bought this for my husband because he used it in high school back in the 1970's. When my husband recieved his cologne he noticed that it was much weeker than what he remembered and the scent only lasts but one hour after application. My advise would be to save your money and buy something much more quality other than this product. We gave it three stars only because it is a nice scent but definitely not long lasting at all. By the way Houbigant is not longer a business, Dana I believe bought it and Dana is five and dime kind of products-I rest my case."
3,Not Like The Original,"When I was unable to locate my husband's favorite cologne at our local mall, I began searching online to find it. My husband is a special ed preschool teacher and he uses this scent as a positive association for the children, so he didn't want to switch to some other cologne that would confuse them. I was so happy to find what I thought to be Houbigant's Musk from this seller. When my husband put the cologne on, the scent was much more subtle than the original and I had to get right next to him to smell it. I don't think it's as long-lasting as the original either.I'm giving Monsieur Musk by Dana three stars, because the aroma is nice, but the cologne is just not the same."
1,Dana destroyed a good product.,"I used Monsieur Houbiugant Musk cologne for thirty years. I love the scent especially after a time, how it blended with my body scent. People always told me I smelled like a just got out of the shower. No More! Dana had changed the product and the result is a vegetable mustiness that is unpleasant. I am so disappointed that I can no longer have this product as it was. Dana, if you care, please return to the original formula.Joel"
2,Math lessons not so useful,"This book has some good lessons, but there are only a few for each grade, so overall it was not that helpful."
5,A keeper,"I already miss the Temptation books! This one is such a sensual story about two who really belong together. I won't repeat what the story is about, but you will end up feeling for each of them and watching their relationship and love grow even though they fight it to the end. Jill Shalvis' writing has a way to pull you into the story that you will feel the empathy of the characters. Every book she's written has been on my keepers shelf."
4,Good read!,"I enjoyed this book so much that I ordered more of Jill Shalvis' books for my kindle. However, I did wish for something to surprise me during this read as it felt like it was the same old story line."
2,Needs improvements,"I love Melissa and Doug products, but this puzzle was disappointing. The pieces are not cut out into the shapes of the letters. The bubble shapes are harder for my 2 yr old to figure out, so he can't get them into the right spots without help. He is normally really good at puzzles but the shapes are confusing.The other major miss is the choice of pictures under the letters. For instance, under the letter D is a swan. I'm sure the manufacturer intended a duck but it looks exactly like a graceful, long-necked white swan. Even the beak looks swan-like in shape.For q they did a quail. Maybe a queen would have been more clear for a 2 yr old? He just sees a bird. V is a vine. Took me a moment to figure out what the picture was trying to depict. My son thinks the Basket under the letter B is an acorn.He still likes it but he loves letters already. It does look nice and I like the little puzzle piece handles."
3,Expected more but it's still okay.,I'm bummed that the letters aren't cut into the letter shape. It makes it a lot harder for my 2 year old to put them back where they belong.I also agree with the PP about the images being a bit off for kids this age. Seems like strange choices.The last thing that bugs me is how small the pieces are. Not a fan at all.It has only been played with a couple of times and I'm ready to move on to something else. I'm hoping she will show more interest when she is a little older.
3,"Educational, but weird choice of symbols","We like Melissa and Doug puzzles, but this one is a little different. The alphabet pieces are easy to maneouvre, like their other puzzles, but the ideas that they chose to represent each letter are sometimes weird/confusing.A is for apple, B is for basket, C for carrot, D for duck, E for egg (why is the egg blue? My kid thought it was a balloon), F has a picture of a bird, implying 'feather'. Too off-track for my 2 year old.Other unusual ones: I is for insect. J is for jumprope, Q is for Quail. T for tie, V for vine, Y for yarn.Why didn't they choose items that weren't so 'obtuse', like F is for foot, I is for ice cream, Q is for quilt, or 'quack' (duck)T is for toes, V is for vaccuum, Y is for yam/yogurt/yellow...why didn't they hire me? ;)By the time my kid knows these words himself, he will be too old for the manipulative side of the puzzle.So, you have to be ready to do the puzzle with your young child, if you are practicing words."
1,Letters are not cut out in letter shape.,"I bought this for my 2 year old who has done other similar puzzles, but this one was almost impossible because the letters are not cut out in the correct shape (more like a cicle/square). So, this is way too difficult for her to do. I put it into storage until she is older. I would not buy this alphabet puzzle, but one that has the letters actually cut out and matching the background."
1,Pieces arent in the shape of letters!,"I don't normally post reviews but I was really disappointed with this product. My two year old loves puzzles, and I credit them to helping him learn his shapes and numbers. We have tons of Melissa and Doug puzzles but this one is terrible. The pieces are not cut out in the shape of letters so my son has trouble figuring out where to put them. Plus, the pictures/words associated with the letters are odd choices and not necessarily what you would like (i.e., quail for ""Q""--he saw a bird, not a quail, and though ""B"" for bird). In addition, the letters are not made out of hard, sturdy wood like other puzzles. I had to buy another letter puzzle."
2,Broken,"This puzzle looks so cute. I bought it for my 20 month old son for Christmas. I just received it yesterday and the ""X"" wasn't even punched onto the hole or glued down.... it's just laying in the packaging. Anyone with eyes can see that there is something amiss with this and yet they sent it anyway. Where is Quality Control when you need it? That is the reason I am giving it such a low score. Aside from it not being made properly, my son would have LOVED this. I chose Melissa and Doug products because out every product that I have of theirs, is made with quality but not this."
3,it was alright,very cute. my daughter loves playing with letters. she loves playing with it. recommend for any child whose learning letters
3,Educational but a drag to collect/clean up,I thought the puzzle pieces would be bigger and heavier but not really. So they fall easily out of the spaces when my daughter picks up the puzzle. And since they are small you can lose the pieces easier.
1,"Missing the Letter ""V""","I received this alphabet puzzle with the letter V missing. A Y was inserted into the V's place in the puzzle so we have two Ys - cute move. Since our son needs to learn all of the letters of the alphabet, we will be returning this item, hassle notwithstanding."
5,Another great Melissa and Doug puzzle,"What can I say, I am a huge Melissa and Doug fan, my 2.5 yo loves this puzzle and acts surprised at the pictures everytime he plays with it, probably for my sake, lol. It's very durable and the pegs make fitting the pieces back in place easy. A great buy for the money."
3,Puzzle,"I liked this puzzle but some of the pictures could have been represented differently, i.e. I is for insect (this was tough for my kid to figure out)."
2,Too Much Confusion for a Toddler,"Melissa and Doug have produced some wonderful, educational, age-appropriate developmental toys for toddlers and pre-schollers. This is NOT one of them. Older children will understand and coordintate the letters with the odd pictures inside, but will be bored within a few minutes of play. Younger children will not grasp the matching concepts used for letter/piece placement. Several of the letter pieces are interchangable, making mistakes very easy and not helping with the learning process. My overall impression of this educational product is that flashy colors and imaginative picture matches for the entire alphabet makes it pretty, but useless for anything other than a dust collector. I have taken it away from my toddler and do not plan on using it again."
4,For my 20 month old,"I know the age recommendation says 3 years old but i went ahead and got it for my daughter. Of course, she doesn't know how to do it yet but she loves it. I didn't know it was handmade but after i got it, I could tell it was handmade. Not too sturdy. Hopefully, it will last until she turns 3."
4,for my nephew ...,as with the other puzzle.... I think its colorful.. the abc one will help him for sure... he's very smart...
2,"""ONE CAN ONLY AWAIT VOLUME TWO.""","These words, I wrote 40 years ago when the album was released. The presumptuousness of ""....Volume One"" for a 'superstar' (a word too much in vogue at that time) compelled me to write that terse review. Actually, it was not so much a review as an ad, part of several mini-photos and descriptions that were not much longer. Sherman, a likeable enough fellow, was on the TV series SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS as a parallel to Michael Landon's ""Little Joe"" character on BONANZA. So.......now you know! (For the record --- as it were --- I never listened to this collection. They didn't give us turntables. However, I notice you can buy one here at Amazon.com...!!!!)"
4,Nice HEAVY Dutch Oven,This dutch oven is made well. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the thickness on the sides is a little inconsistent. It appears to be a little thicker in some areas. This doesn't interfere with the use of the product nor the quality of items cooked.
5,Superman Tow hitch,"Good product. I bought this for my husbands Ford F150, it fits perfect, and looks great, he loves it! Fast shipping!"
5,Super - no hitch!,"This trailer hitch plug is ... super! I love it, and it is actually made of metal and still looks brand new after two months on my vehicle. I had to make sure and get a lock so noone would try and steal my hitch just for the hitch plug."
3,Better than I expected,"I did not buy this movie for myself...In fact, the only reason I bought it was because someone I was seeing at the time mentioned the movie to which I responded, ""Oh I absolutely love that movie."" I bought the movie the next day on Amazon.com and watched it two nights later. I was not disappointed. It is not the greatest movie of all time, but it was a good peek into the fast paced world of the successful black woman. Success comes at its costs, as told through this movie: whether abandonment, feelings of worthlessness, or just plain old loneliness, this movie deals with them all. I think this movie is a treat for viewers regardless of their ethnicity or gender."
3,Famous Quote From the Simpsons,"Marge to Homer as he and Bart return from the video store:""Did you get 'Waiting to Exhale'?""Homer:""They put us on the 'Waiting to Exhale' waiting list, but they said don't hold your breath!"""
5,Long time no see!!,I was very excited to receive my dvd not only ontime but early! It's a movie I always wanted to own and was very reasonably priced also.
4,Good Girlfriends Movie,"I like the support and friendship of the women. I think the women are a bit needy and clingy, reason for the 4 stars.Overall I really enjoyed the movie."
5,classic,what can i say another classic movie that is one of the one i will watch when i get that feeling to sit back and reminisce.thanks
3,Nice Item,Most movies that I like are from the time when all movies came on VHS. It is nice to find these great movies on DVD at Amazon.com.
5,it was great it made me wish i had more close friends,it was great couldnt have watched a more entertaining movie
5,"I saw the movie before I read the book, and I loved both!","I saw the movie when it first came out, and I've just started to read the book, and I can't put it down! I can relate to some of the problems the characters were going through."
5,"""Waiting To Exhale""- A fascinating book.","Terry McMillan is an outstanding fiction writer who wrote a fascinating book. She tells a story of four intelligent African American women who struggles in female-male relationships. I liked this book because she speaks in a language that anyone could understand and the stories she tells will sometimes make you laugh. Her stories are fiction, but seem so real. ""Waiting To Exhale"" is a book that almost everyone can relate to because most of us have been through good and bad relationships. END"
2,good,"This should have been better but Angela Bassett's performance was the best, so I guess it's worth a watch."
2,"Blah, chick-flick or not (and I'm a chick) this movie is sap","This movie was too sappy, even for me. For those who say it's pretty much a chick-flick? Perhaps for the ""chicks who live for men club"", maybe, but not for this chick. It was like bathing in Masengil..."
3,Whitney cannot act.,I so agree with the viewer who said that Whitney killed this film. It seems as if people are afraid to bad mouth her but her fakeness deserves to be joked about. I could have easily liked this because of the other performances but in an ensemble one bad one effects the balance and it becomes cartoonish. Bassett should be in way better films than the current space film she's in.
1,waiting to exhale,never received this dvd!!!!!!! will not order from this person again!!! disappointed customer ;(
1,Pirated?,"Waiting to Exhale is one of my favorite movies, and a classic. However, while viewing this film the picture began to pixelate. Was it recorded from a satellite dish during bad weather? I have no idea, but to say the least, I am disappointed in the DVD and its seller."
5,The ultimate black woman empowering film!,"When you want to invite your sistas over for a girls night out, you should watch this movie! I love the fact that every woman had their own problems and that, instead of sitting around moping about it, they did something! This did not put the usual stereotype on black women as some other movies may have. I was tired of seeing all of these female-bonding movies with white women. Without this movie, ""Soulfood"" might not have never been made."
4,The movie did the book injustice,"Although the movie was great to watch with your girlfriends, it did do some damage to the book. What could have been added to the movie were the organizations that the women belonged to so it wouldn't seem as if the women were overly emotional over their disastruous relationships."
3,"This movie was okay, the book was sooooo much better.","I enjoyed the movie but I think Whitney Houston should stick to singing. She just is not a good actress. I walked out of ""Bodyguard"" because she was so bad in that. But ""Waiting to Exhale"" was alright and had some touching and enjoyable moments. My favorite moment was anytime Leon was in a scene, eventhough he didn't play a particularly likeable character. It was worth watching just to see him and Gregory Hines."
4,This is a fine movie which indicates that Black women fall in love too and get hurt in relationships and become bitter.,"Although this movie is about women primarily, the men play a very significant role and the flaws in the men brings out the wonderful strength in the women. It exhibits sex but not nudity which is refreshing. Each of the women get their revenge against the men who triffle with them and the women end of basically optimistic in the end and seem confident that there is a brighter day ahead for them. One woman with a child decides to let her son grow up and be a man. Another woman decides to become a single mother.The scene where Wesley Snipes and Angela Bassett lie in bed in their clothes is a very tender moment in the film. I have wondered for a long time why Wesley Snipes did not get billing for this film."
4,romance,i chose four stars because it could have been a little better in the romance dept. ....only one of the girlfriends ended up with a relationship in the end and i would have liked a movie ending and not what it is in real life...yes i did like it and bought it because whitney was in it and would recommend it to my friends to see.
5,They nailed it!,"This movie leaves no stone unturned, and depicts the true challenges for women of color. It is sad but truly refeshing! Someone got it right!"
4,women at their finest beating the odds against a male sociey,angela basset stole the screen with the real life drama story. all the ladies in this picture up hold a level of class and loviness far beyond the rest. thumbs up to them all
3,"So, So......",Well.. the cover was dented in when I recieved it... wasn't very impressed since I was looking forward to recieving this dvd.. dvd works fine though so besides the massive dent in the cover its good. It was cheap so I guess it boils down to you pay for what you get..
1,Does not work,"I live in an apartment with a crappy toilet (or pipes), that toilet has always have problems flushing, the frequent clogging is really annoying. Tried regular plunger (similar to Master Plunger on here), had little luck, bought Kleer Drain from the ""Save Money. Live Better."" store, it works but the CO2 cartridges cost a lot so I was looking for a cheaper alternative. Then I bought this Drain Buster on ""fleabay"" for $10. Kept pumping for like 10 minutes, nothing, water AND bubbles ""escape"" from the side rubber cup. The fact is every toilet bowl has a slightly different shape, the generic rubber cup won't make a perfect seal. These days only the CO2 can unclogged my toilet, the bright side is you can buy 8g CO2 cartridges real cheap on ""fleabay"" (brands don't matter, as long as they are 8g). Save your $, the Drain Buster does NOT work."
2,Not very effective,"I have used this a few times since I got it and the suction it creates does not do anything to free up a clogged toilet. Maybe it works better on a sink drain, but I will stick to an old fashioned good plunger."
2,Not what I expected,"Didn't get good suction with the blaster, even tried changing to the smaller size cup. No change in drains noted."
3,Drain Buster,After many attempts on my own ie plumber I decided to try this product at first it didnt seem to do what I thought but I tried again then I let it sit for a minute (the plugged drain) and when I ran water down it was unclogged. I was impressed but you need to be the judge Im glad I fixed what a plumber couldnt so Im HAPPY
2,Disappointed,"After using this product, I concluded that any standard plunger did just as good or even a better job than the Drain Buster did. Save your money."
1,Smartworks Multi Drain Plunger,"I should have followed the advice on previous reviews. The negative reviews were correct, this is a piece of junk. My husband used this item in the bathtub and the the plunger did not provide adaquate suction. While trying to use the device it broke, the plunger just came apart. We were very dissappointed with this item. We do not recommend it to any one."
3,Decent Tribute To A Brilliant Band,"A bunch of unknown bands take a shot at covering several well known Leppard classics. Some are terrible; like the industrial sounding cover of ""Pour Some Sugar On Me."" Some are just OK: the standard sounding cover of ""Wasted."" The best cover is a really heavy and rocking version of ""Too Late For Love."" Leppard's impressive production makes them a tough band to cover, but its real cool and about time a tribute album has been made in their honor."
2,"Decent, but not done right!","Def Leppard, sellers of 60 million plus albums deserves a better tribute than what has been placed on Tributized. It was a good effort, but all of these bands are unknown and lack the talent to perform Leppard music. The forthcoming tribute with better known artist will be worth a buy, but this one is only good for Rock of Ages and Women. They totally butchered Pour Some Sugar On Me with that industrial sound. Other song sound like something out of a struggling club act. My recommendation is buy it, but make sure your not expecting a high level of exellence in the recording and performance."
2,Injustice for All,"This is a pretty terrible tribute album. However, there are some descent songs. Women and Rock of Ages are pretty much the only good renditions. Pour some sugar on me is AWFUL! It's an industrial version. And photograph has a contemporary standard rock 4/4 beat with what sounds like a poor man's Matt Barlow on vocals. Avoid if you can. I give it two stars only because of its two good songs and that it isn't nearly as bad as those death metal Iron Maiden tributes."
2,deaf leopard,"You cant complain about this cd. Its somthing that you can kick back to and enjoy because i mean its def lep material. Its not as good as i hoped it would be. these none popular bands did quite good. Some guitar playing turned out to be better than the original def lep tunes. but overall, its the little esseintal things that made this cd overall not very good. Voices, guitar sound, missing guitar solos were some disappointment. but if ur a big def lep fan like me, i say buy it. It's somthing to put in the def lep collection!"
4,It's worth it!,"No, it's not Academy Award calibre, and it isn't going to cure all the world's ills, and it won't even make any reviewer's Top Ten lists. But, this is still a very funny movie, with some priceless scenes and quips, and excellent campy performances from Divine and Lainie Kazan. If you are a pretentious snob or drama queen, don't bother. If you're in the mood for cheap and taudry humor, this is your movie. I love it."
2,Divine without John Waters....,"....is like apple pie without ice cream. This is sure to disappoint those who think Divine made John Waters' movies entertaining. Also, a lot of people seem to think this was a John Waters project--He had nothing to do with it.The movie is just not very funny. Paul Bartel won my admiration with ""Eating Raoul"", so I was thinking a movie with my favorite drag queen directed by Paul Bartel was sure to have plenty of laughs. I was sorely disappointed by the experience. The comic highlight is Divine's singing bit, but everything else is sub-par.I haven't seen the DVD version of this, and may consider purchasing it for the Edith Massey screen test mentioned by another reviewer, but other than that, I have no reason to purchase the DVD copy. Rent this one before buying!"
5,lust in the dust,i loved this movie. I always liked tab hunter and was shocked he would make a movie like this. it was totally funny and enjoyable.
2,best western since Blazing Saddles,Tongue-In-Cheek A somewhat raunchy western comedy-it did not nor will it winany awards.
3,"""I've had carnal knowledge of 215 women and 2 goats.""","On the road to Chili Verde Divine hooks up with Tab Hunter, once there they learn of the legend of the gold. Guns fights, cat fights and sexual hijinks follow but it's all too tame. The first 15 minutes are fine with Divine swimming bottomless then wearing out four rapists, but soon the focus of the film drifts away from the campy stuff and goes more about the story of the lost gold. Who cares about the gold?! I want to see Divine half-naked and singing and eating pie underwater and maybe biting a midget on the foot, not searching for gold.I respect Paul Bartel, but I think John Waters would have been better for this movie. Yea, I know he turned down the job but that doesn't change the fact he probably would have made a better film. At least it would have been cruder and campier and that's what we want right?Also Gina Gallego didn't have a big enough role."
3,These Lips Were Made for Kissin,"It isn't the greatest movie ever, but it has some great moments. I am buying this strictly to hear Divine's pub room song. It is th highlight of the film. Another scene you'll love is when a lover gets accidently squeezed to death between Divine's legs. And don't miss Divine riding a donkey through the desert!"
5,Lust in the Dust,Lust in the DustDVD - The delivery service was exceptional. I collect John Waters movies.
3,Wacky Western,Only a few will truly appreciate the craziness of this movie. If you are a serious person and have never seen a John Water's movie - you may not enjoy this.
3,"The film has its moments, but is not very funny overall","I'm sorry to be the naysayer here, but I feel like someone should warn the general populace who might buy this movie thinking it might be another ""Hairspray."" It isn't.I'm sorry to say this, but what this film needed was John Waters. While it has its funny moments, overall it isn't really funny enough to be engaging. It seems like Paul Bartel wasn't sure whether he wanted the film to be campy or an ordinary comedy, and he doesn't straddle this fence well. The script just frequently falls flat.Divine is still a presence on screen, and so this dvd is worth having for her true fans. That is the reason I bought this. But there is no way that I will play this dvd as often as, say, Hairspray, Female Trouble, Polyester, or Pink Flamingos."
5,Wonderful Perfume Oil,"Love this scent, but it has become difficult to purchase locally, so I buy it online now. All of the Auric Blends are amazing...they last a long time and are very pleasant scents, not overwhelming. Anyone close to you can smell it, but you don't overwhelm a room with your perfume, which I like...you can't really use too much of it. They also do not irritate my skin like some perfumes do. I also add the oils to unscented lotion. This particular scent, One Love, is a blend of cherry and vanilla. Very yummy scent. Sweet, but clean. Can't beat the price, either."
3,Baby Powder + Cherry Jolly Rancher,"I received this as a Christmas gift. It smells to me like a mix of baby powder and cherry Jolly Ranchers. I cannot decide if I like the smell or not. I have heard mostly positive things about it and a few negative things about it when I wear it. I think the price is very reasonable, beings that perfumes are usually VERY expensive! It has quite a sweet smell and would be better for youner girls/teenagers. I am 15, and even I think it may be a little too sweet for me."
3,way too sweet,It's ok just overwhelmingly sweet. Maybe that's just because I like softer scents. I feel like this scent is best for someone between the ages of 10-13
3,"Review of The Further Adventures of Batman, Vol 2, Featuring the Penguin","Considering that this has been on the shelf since 1992, it is in suprisingly good condition.This also probably has some of the most decent stories that fully capture the Penguin's character. Unfortunately, two of the eleven stories don't have the Penguin; there about crimes outside of Gotham. Sadly, the title has ""featuring"" the Penguin, not ""revolving"" around the Penguin. The only major flaw is that this book doesn't have enough Penguin tales.So if you're a fan that revolves around the Penguin, this might be an excellent book for you. If you're a Batman fan, in general, this would still be a good book."
3,Daybreak,"*** NO ENGLISH SUBTITLING ***NO matter how beautifully filmed. NO matter how beautiful you actors are.NO matter how good the story is, IF YOUR ENGLISH SPEAKING CUSTOMERS can'tunderstand a word you actors are saying, WE LOSE 90% OF THE STORY.I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS 5 STARS FOR CINEMATIC BEAUTY ALONE, BUT I DON'T KNOWWHAT ANYONE SAID.PLEASE RESTORE ** SUBTITLING ** TO YOU CINEMATIC OFFERINGS."
2,Too long,"""Daybreak"" is a lovestory between a closet case, married guy and another gay, who is not afraid of his feelings.They meet once in a while in a beach house that belongs to the parents of the married one.Not only different approach to own sexuality creates gap between them, but also their material status.It could have been quite good film, if only some scenes weren't that slow. Even if the director intended to create ""a special atmosphere"", the result seems to disappoint.Poor quality of subtitles (the moment actors speak ""broken english"", the translation is gone) makes it more difficult to understand it.Judge for yourself, but rent before you buy it."
3,Shortened?,"After having seen the DVD from Waterbearer like the previous reviewer I feel that something is missing from the film. It does not portray the relationship as if it is the final night and certainly it does not indicate that these two people have had an on and off relationship as some reviewers have suggested. I think it is due to the DVD having only a 66 mins running time when the box quotes the running time as 75 mins. Secondly some scenes seen on the trailer are not included in the film. I do not think we are seeing the film as it should be. There must be cuts somewhere. I have written to Waterbearer, but have not obtained a satisfactory answer. Any ideas from those who have seen both the theatrical release and the DVD. Are there any discrepancies?"
3,"Good Book, But I was looking for Answer Key too",Bit disappointed when the answer key is sparse. English is not myu first language and I always have trouble finding right usage of grammar.
2,not all that great,"I do not think it's a great product, the exercises are way too simple and sometimes confusing"
3,Not a toy,More a craft than a toy. very small intricate parts that need painted and assembled. It is very quality made kit for anyone with seady hands and patients of Jobe!
5,Chicksaw Mudd Puppies: White Dirt,"Track Listing:1. McIntosh2. Skinny3. Lon Chaney4. Lookout5. Frogmore6. Prison7. Raven8. Ponky Knot9. Sailor, Beat The Blood Out"
1,TRASH!!!,I facilitate a book club and have done so for 7 years. We are a very diverse group with an array of taste. This book was an all time low for our group. What a waste of time!!!!
1,Very Disappointed,"I have liked every other book by this author, but Vertigo was incredibly disappointing. I could not even get through it!! (and I rarely ever abandon books) I skimmed through it just to see how it ended but found myself not at all caring about the characters. As a mother, Emma disgusted me. She had no regard for her son and barely mentioned him and how her relationship with Chance would impact him. I would skip this book and recommended any of Baratz-Logsted's other novels instead."
3,Very dark novel,"Be careful whom you trust would sum up the moral of this story. This is a book that will truly make you think. The heroine, Emma, is a wife and mother in the Victorian times, and literally lives for her husband and her son, never herself. The reader will understand and feel compassionate towards her as she faces life in what seems like a fancy birdcage. In seventeen years of marriage, the woman has never had an orgasm. I daresay, that alone would give us modern women a reason to kill our husbands! As she takes up correspondence with a prisoner, she begins to have urges and desires and finally identifies them as such. When the opportunity arrises, she finds the courage to act on them. Whereas the reader will not agree that killing her husband is the best answer, the reader will also sympathize with her regarding her plight. After the death of her husband, the novel takes a most shocking turn. The ending somewhat leaves you hanging tho, thus getting three stars from me instead of four."
3,Falls short of expectations,"I'm from Argentina, and during a visit to the States I was taken to Taco Bell and bought the tape, which I've loved ever since. I have been looking for the CD version for a couple of years because the tape is slowly dying away, but compared to it this cd is a bit disappointing, as other reviewers have said. Yet, it's quite good ir you avoid the comparison..."
2,Our Busted Pencil Sharpener,"My brother and I never used this pencil sharpener much because it didn't sharpen evenly. We kept on using manual sharpeners. If the manual sharpeners broke the tip of the pencil 3 times, we would try our electric one again. Today, my brother sharpened about 20 pencils in a row. The motor just burned out and wouldn't work again. We made sure the plug was connected with the socket. This pencil sharpener also makes a lot of noise. I personally prefer the Panasonic KP-310 sharpener. I haven't tried out any of the other 5-star Panasonic ones. We have a Panasonic KP-310 sharpener at my school. It only burnt out after I sharpened about 4 boxes of colored pencils (300 colored pencils) in a row when helping my teacher. Note: this pencil sharpener has no auto-stop. I would NOT buy this pencil sharpener for the price. It's more worth it to buy a sharpener that not only works, has durability, but works well."
1,Not worth it!,This was not worth the price at all! At first I thought it was great. It is heavy and sturdy. It worked barely a month and just quit working. Not worth it and not a good product at all. Don't waste your money!
1,mrs,Item didn't last for a week. I got very disappointed because I paid a high price for this used item and it didn't work.
1,"before 10 days of use, it's broke.","After many pencils sharping, the machine doesn't recognize when a pencil is on the hole and we need to press the pencil against the bottom side of the hole to make the engine start's to run. I never expect that happening after just 10 days using it."
4,Nice pencil sharpener,Small in size and this thing tears through pencils and leaves a nice tip. We've had if for a month with no problems. So far so good!
2,Busted after about 18 months.,"This gets a lot of use in my office, but still... I think it should have lasted longer. Choose a different one!"
4,classic!,"yes, someone else bought this! i picked it up in toronto several years ago and it has withstood the test of time! eighteen years later and this still sounds great - timeless and romantic! an unknown classic."
1,Wrong Sizes,"The tool has sockets for 1/2"" and 3/4"" gas valves. My gas valve is slightly larger than 1/2"" (maybe 5/8"" by PG&E in California) and the 3/4"" socket was way to big to close the gas valve. So, check the size of your gas shut off valve first before buying this tool. The tool looks OK for 1/2"" and 3/4' valves"
2,The book has almost 400 pages... 200 are pressure traverse charts,"I was expecting a little bit more of a practical guide on how to use the nodal analysis to optimize production. Instead I got perhaps 20 pages or less on how to optimize a system (there's not much to it I guess), a whole chapter on Inflow-Outflow theory, 200 pages of pressure traverse charts and a chapter on IPR correlations.If you are looking for a practical guide, this is definitely NOT the book... @ $125.00 I think it was a bit on the expensive side."
5,Great beginners guide to stock trading,"Since I day trade stocks on a part time basis, I was curious to see how the author bridge the gap between the day trading and short-term investing or medium term trading. I have to admit the author did an excellent job. Everything seems to be here-- from technical analysis to taxes. It is truly the ""one-stop guide"" to short term investing or medium term trading.I particularly enjoyed technical analysis chapters. They were complete and well illustrated. All of the complex technical analysis indicators were well explained and illustrated. The language was easy to understand. The examples were real. Good job. The author was able to explain complex information in a simple step-by-step manner. It is not surprising that the author has an advanced degree. I do recommend this book to anyone considering the stock trading."
5,I found it!,"One of the best on the subject I have read... and I have read a lot. I particually enjoyed his charting and mathmatical explorations. Very good analysis on the importance and uses of MACD, EMA, and Bollinger Bands. This book took my trading to a new level."
3,Hrn...,"Things wind down in the second volume of X-day..... and it really did not really give me a satisfactory feeling. Yes, everyone becomes semi-happy, but it had potential to be so much more. Ah, well. The only thing that makes this book worthwhile is the short story at the end which is fantastic! I loved it."
3,gr,"i was expecting lotsa cool flashy stuff, but not really much happened. didn't live up to the first one. I love the story at the end though, 'The Final Supper'. that alone made this book worth it in the end!"
1,As the obsessive Space Ghost fan said...,"COP OUT!!!!The first book was edgy and managed to create an improbable mixture of mellowness and anger. All of the characters were interesting and real, as were their problems. In the first book all the characters were forced to do things they didn't want to: X-Day was meant to be their day of liberation. But X-Day never comes. I hope that the ending of the book is meant to be ironic, that they all decided to adopt plastic smiles like the rest of the world; but the author either betrayed their original intention, or was forced to change it. As for The Last Supper: what the hell was that all about? I'm getting sick of manga publishes just throwing in random stories by the same author just for the hell of it. It was an insipid preachy fable, but at least it wasn't as nearly distracting as when Viz did it in the first volume of ""Boys Over Flowers""."
1,A horrible ending to a horrible manga,After a lousy first volume I read the second one. It mangaged to be even worse than volume 1. The ending was abrupt and corny and a huge disappointment to a disappointing series. I also felt that the absolutely awful short manga story at the end was simply tacked on to add more pages to the volume.Don't buy volume 1 and don't buy volume 2. You'll be disappointed unless you enjoy wasting money on garbage.
3,Definitely not his best,"Just like a lot of people I was a little disappointed by this album. I thought it was gonna blow me away like the Keep It Turned On album, but sadly it didn't. There were a couple of songs on here I did like a little bit like Cry Me A River and What The World Needs Now. Rick's voice is amazing... he can sing the phonebook and I would be happy. I think the problem is that the fans really wanted to hear some new material written by him instead of remakes. Portrait is just a little too mellow for my taste. I am grateful that he still came out with new album... it's better than nothing at all. I'm still trying to let is grow on me though. I support Rick's music no matter what, that's what being a real fan is all about."
1,Disappointing Album,"I have all of Rick's albums and as a follow up to the fantastic ""Keep It Turned On"" album, this one is a huge disappointment. I have nothing against cover albums but this one sounds like someone was forcing him to sing in the bathroom at gunpoint. The choice of songs on the album don't mesh at all with his vocal style and the songs themselves are all too slow paced. I paid over $30 for this album (import) and can't recommend it at all unless you are a super groupie diehard fanatic Rick Astley fan. I hope he comes out with another album soon with songs that he has written."
1,Whyyyy Rick ? Whyyyyyyyy ???,"This cd should come with a warning ""DO NOT DRIVE OR OPERATE HEAVY MACHINERY WHILE LISTENING"". This collection has about asmuch sizzle as a seven day old open can of pop. At first listen i could hardly tell where ""vincent"" ended and ""Love you so"" began!, mainly due to the sparse acoustic production style whichfalls way flat. I found my ears straining for other instruments to join in. And If you expect to hear his bold and firey baritone vocals here...forget it. Rick is singing in his sleepon this one. This is such a dissapointment while knowing what great things he can do with that voice when paired with the right production. Recall ""Body and Soul"",""Waiting for the bell to Ring"", ""Hoplessly"",""Cry for Help"". These beautifully astounding songs proved Astley had branched successfully beyond his earlier dance artist fame. This collection however takes him and many of his fans nowhere fast."
5,Very Good,This candy purchase was amazing. It came in 2 days after ordering it and I did not even pay for speed shipping. Everyone I gave some to loved it...too bad I have not seen anyone who sells this in stores where I live.
1,something tastes funny,"I really enjoy the Hi-chews except in Mango. I was happy to see this offered in grape so imagine my disappointment when I tasted a very, very strong chemical taste in these. I would compare it to nail polish remover. I contacted the seller with my concern but was ignored. Don't buy the GRAPE!!I had to rate this with 1 star otherwise my review wouldn't go through, but I take it back."
2,Sizes are big,size runs bigger than the average boot. they are too big nothing I do helps. This was a total waste of money for me.
4,Good Boot. Runs Large,"Overall, this boot is a high quality work boot. The leather is very nice quality. The stitching looks like it will hold up (I haven't had these long enough to comment fully on durability). They are quite comfortable, and I don't even notice the steel toe.My one caution is that the sizing for these boots is really, really off. I am normally a 10.5 wide shoe size. After reading these tend to run a bit big, I ordered 10 wides. The width was perfect, but they were way off in length. I settled on these in a 9 wide, with an extra pair of socks to take up a bit of the extra room. Ideally, I would have gone down to an 8.5 wide, but the width of the 9 wides was narrower than the 10 wides which made me think anything smaller than the 9.5 wides would be too narrow."
4,Great Boots,These boots were of excellent quality. They also looked great. My son in law said that they felt really good on his feet. I would recommend them to anyone who likes a good fitting boot with great style.
5,the best of the best,"I watched this in 1982 and it inspired me to be the derelict i am today, actually it taught me alot"
4,A mixture of the best music genres!,"If you like African music, Latin music and French music than this is something for you! This is a mixture of all those genres together! And it's one of the funniest songs ever written! This is a MUST to buy! It's one of my favorites! So why shouldn't it be yours?"
3,Grace,I enjoy this CD very much. It is always in my CD player in my car. I love tracks 4 and 7 the best.
2,This was not recorded live in Kenya...,"Good music here...great presentation. But this was not recorded in Kenya - as the album states. It was instead recorded live at the Potter's House in Dallas with some instrumentation recorded in the studio. I know...it's disappointing to hear that. By the way, most of these songs are covers...not original songs. Several artists have recorded these songs and that hurts the album's value a bit. But the choir sounds very good and there's some great singing on board."
5,BRING BACK THIS WONDERFUL HOLIDAY CLASSIC!,"This is one of the best Christmas albums I've ever heard..anything done by the Andrews Sisters is golden. Please bring back this Christmas cd along with the other Christmas volume that contains their great version of Sleigh Ride. This album, however, is a true classic-how can you go wrong with duet partners like Bing Crosby & Danny Kaye? A must-have for collectors of good old fashioned holiday music, may it never go out of style!"
1,More Socialist Tripe from McQuaig,"If you wanted the Canadian equivalent of Squealer in George Orwell's best-selling Animal Farm, you wouldn't need to look further than McQuaig.Her predicatable and tiresome rants against the wealthy capitalists that earn their living despite the odds in Canada against the dreaded accumulation of wealth, grates against McQuaig, who is a friend to all things Socialist.By reciting page after page of Left-Wing talking points, her book hopes to infuse her fellow Communists with even more reasons to extract and redistribute the wealth of useful Canadians to their pet causes.This is Mein Kampf for the Homeless, and is not worth the paper its written on.A definite NO to this propaganda tripe!"
4,An intense and intelligent read,"It is incredibly difficult to find intelligent and well written books for the lesbian reader. They are either too sappy, completely unrealistic, or have little to no plot other gratuitous and explicit sex scenes. This book offers a sense of realism and excitement for your mind as well as your libido. The story is riveting and full of twists. Just when you think you know what's going to happen, you are proven wrong. The characters are as flawed as we are. That fact made it easy for me to feel the intensity of what the characters felt, and is only one of the reasons why this book is such a great read. When you begin this book, you won't want to put it down.I hope Ms. Goldsby has more for us in the future, because I know I'll be watching for any further works by this talented author."
2,Avid Reader,"I have read and re-read the first edition of Gabrielle's first book. This is the second edition. Upon reading this new edition I thought perhaps my copy was missing many pages. I absolutely love her work, however am sad to say I enjoyed the first edition much better."
5,Very nice reel,"I have 3 of them (1- MA-30DX, 2 - MA-45DX )!!!No problemsExcellent for trolling. NOT FOR BAITCASTNice feature the feet count"
4,Left handed line counter reel,"I haven't had a chance to use this reel, but it looks to be what I'm looking for to troll for salmon, striper and large trout. I will update my review after a field test."
4,"Solid collection, but a few flaws","First, a warning: the songs in this book are NOT COMPLETELY TRANSCRIBED. Looking for the bridge to ""Eddie Walker?"" Not in the book; better be able to learn it from ear.That being said, what is in the book is of high quality. The transcriptions are dead on, and the CD helps get you through the tougher passages like the end of ""Philosophy"" and the piano solo from ""Song For the Dumped."" The song selection, while questionable at times (""Mess"" but no ""Army?"" ""Evaporated"" but no ""One Angry Dwarf?"" C'mon!), is overall quite good and will satisfy most Ben Folds Five.But if you're HARD CORE into BFF, you may be better off with album folios, which have complete transcriptions. Still, this is a great book and will occupy hours of piano time. Play like Ben. Impress your friends. Have fun."
1,The Year of Miss Agnes,"We all rate this book a 1 star, because it was sort of interesting. It was mainly boring. ALl that occured was teaching and learning. There were not a lot of exciting parts in the story. Although it was in Alaska it still wasn't very adventurous.The characters were not described very well."
3,Gentle pleasure,"As the winner of the Once Upon a World book award, this book was of particular interest to me for its deaf minor character. A sweet story of the teacher who comes to an Inuit village and breaks the mold of teachers in its past, this gentle story would be a good one for an early chapter book reader. The children of the story relate in realistic ways, and bring a diffferent kind of world, one with similarities in people, but differences in environment and a bit of culture. Agnes' response to the deaf girl who had been routinely ignored by previous teachers is appreciated. Its focus on how enjoyable learning can be is a good notion to remind a young reader. Definitely not a dazzler, this one is gently warming and pleasant. I would recommend it."
4,The Year of Miss Agnes is an okay book,The Year of Miss Agnes is an okay book.It is an okay book because it tells about a new teacher who comes to Alaska all the way from England.She teaches a class that has different age groups but there is not another school down where they live.The thing that I liked the least was that it was not that exciting and it did not have any parts that came on strong!The thing I liked best about this book was that it kind of relates to real life.The people in the town had lived in another village but they had to move to where they live now!Hope you read the book!
4,My Fourth Grade Daughter's Impression of this Book,"Written By Sophia (9yrs. Old)I think that this book is cool. The story takes place back in Alaska in the 1940's. In the story, a girl named Fredrika goes to school. All her classmates and her get a new teacher because all the other teachers could not handle the whole class. ""I wonder if she is nice,"" says Fredreika. She turns out to be very nice. Fredreika wonders if she will like the class and stay for the rest of the year? Well to find out read this story. You just might like it."
5,"So inspiring, hopeful, and uplifting","This is one of the most hopeful and inspiring books I had read. I loved it so much that I bought copies to give as Christmas gifts! Very uplifting !!! And it is such a nice reminder that opportunity is always here, and that every plot (no matter where in the forest) has the potential to succeed. It's what we think, act, and do that makes it successful or not.May you find your 4 leaf clover and your good luck life."
5,"Inspirational, THIS BOOK CHANGED MY LIFE","After reading this book I decided to take the steps that I really needed to accomplish my life goals instead of sitting around, waiting for them to happen to me. I am now inspired to be like Sid...and know that there is only one way to go-up!"
1,Irritating,"While I hate to write anything negative, this book was irritating intellectually and spiritually. The morals of the story are well known ideals--work hard, don't play the victim, you reap what you sow, etc. If you are pagan, you may find this a little disturbing, as with the usage of an evil black-toothed witch named Morganna.Honestly, I felt like I just read a children's fable rather than a business/leadership book."
4,The Standard Reference For PA Fly Fishers,"Dwight Landis has authored and photographed what should be considered the standard reference work for fly fishers in Pennsylvania. He has condensed this immense commonwealth of trout fisheries into a fact-filled and fun read that can give guidance to old and new anglers alike. More than a broad collection of scouting reports, this book lets the reader look through the eyes of a single wise angler who shares hard fact with personal experience. The result is better trout fishing for us all."
1,Amateurish,Borstein needs to stick with her voice-over work (where she is truly gifted) until she can come up with a performance better than this. She relies too much on material she hasnt even written (Hollywood casting breakdowns) to get the laughs and to make a point. A point which we all know...Hollywood has set an ideal for women that no one can live up to. The most interesting part of the DVD is a behind-the scenes look at the offices of Family Guy. If you are looking for stand-up from a women's point of view that is much more insightful and actually delivers the laughs check out Margaret Cho.
3,passion is a part of love,"The stories basic format are the same but if you are a fan of Diana Palmer, we would not want it any other way.Just picture one of the heroes being one of these new modern soppy guys who are being so soft that they end up looking like fairies. I love my heroes like these guys being their usual MCP type but what the heck after all it is fiction and boy I like em like this."
3,Good Book But Disappointing.,"I liked the book. Their passion for one another are so intense. That's the kind of passion I like to read in books, but I didn't like having to read in each story how the heroine were virgins. Don't get me wrong I applaud you for having your characters have morals, but I didn't like to have them ram down my throat. That's how I felt reading each story. If that was the case you should have had each hero not smoke or drink. I was kind of disappointed being that this was my first time reading a Diana Palmer book."
5,replacement for fluval clips,This replacement clasp worked great on my fluval canister filter.it.s easy to replace and is as close to original as possible
2,nobody does it like Death does it!,"the title pretty much says it all. some tracks are good, but over all there is only one band worthy of playing these songs. i recommend any fan to buy every Death album first, and get this after you have completed your collection. i give the bands credit for trying, but they all fall short of achieving the benchmark set by a legendary band."
5,Awesome tribute,"This is an awesome tribute. I prefer the originals, but this is an awesome tribute to get for Chuck's memory. RIP - Chuck - RIP"
4,The Human Touch for Social Studies Lessons,"I used this text as a read aloud with my class as we studied the Oregon Trail. The class was attentive because each of them realized how the writings gave them a glimpse into the lives of actual people. They were no longer just learning about facts, as each reading became like a soap opera behind a major event. I like the way the text offers accounts from different experiences along the trail, most of which shed light on major events that occured at that time."
5,"Here a mug,there a mug everybody chug-a-lug!!! A great Blu Ray disc!!!","This is a great blu Ray Disc of the Broken Lizard hit ""Beerfest"", this is the unrated version!!! Has a great transfer of the film,as well a keg of some great extras!!! As well as the Broken Lizard comedy team,some great all time actinbg talent also appears such as Donald Sutherland,and Cloris Leachman in a role that has to be seen to be beleived!!! A great party film!!! If you liked ""Super Troopers"" than you will probably like this one as well!!! A very fun movie for the adults,NOT for the kiddies!!! A+"
4,Beerfest = just plain ole fashioned fun!,"After seeing Club Dread by this Broken Lizard team, I didn't have very high hopes for Beerfest....that's why I skipped it during it's theater run.After it was released on Netflicks, my buddy rented it on Bluray (not that that you need to see it in HighDef to enjoy this kind of movie), and we loved it!!!I got it on Bluray since I got my PS3 and HDTV, so I don't get DVD's anymore.This movie is just plain dumb fun. Dumb and Dumber, Tommy Boy....that kind of dumb fun. Turn off your brains and enjoy the lewd crude ride."
3,This was a gift.,"I've never seen the movie. But my husband thinks it hysterical, so I but the unrated version as a Christmas gift for him."
4,Great for Beer Drinkers,Non stop laughing! Probably not a model drinking film for young drinkers nor a good movie for under certain minimum ages. But for quality beer drinkers this movie is filled with great laughs and sometimes might cause one to think about their past behavior!!!
3,Great Image Quality - Terrible Movie,"This movie has a great transfer with amazing colors and dynamic picture quality. What this comedy is desperatley missing is any humor whatsoever. Granted i chuckled a couple of times, very few, very far between. There is one good laugh right near the end tat comes from a clever delivery but other than that this Broken Lizard film is on the bottom of the comedy stack... Unfortunatley there are not too many comdeies to choose from in HD DVD right now, but i would definately make this a rental and not a purchase if you have any interest in seeing this film."
3,Vut de schnitzel?,"With a name like Beerfest what guy could resist this movie? Beer, babes and more beer. But the problem is ...it's just not that funny. The plot leaves plenty of room for insane, disgusting, and disturbing jokes, but the writers just didn't take advantage of it. The funniest part of the movie takes place with the slutty grandmother and in Germany, but there just isn't enough of that in the film. One great part of the movie is the soundtrack, which I would give four stars. The movie is certainly worth seeing once, but next time I want a funny, racy, party movie, I'll watch Eurotrip again."
4,Completely reprehensible,"Culturally desolate, completely without any artistic merit. Crude, lewd, and morally bankrupt.And I laughed out loud about 30 times."
3,booze and boobs,"If you enjoy the pictures that the Broken Lizard team has created such as Club Dread, Puddle Cruiser and the comedic classic Super Troopers, then you will thoroughly enjoy this film. It is by no means going to make you more intelligent, keep you guessing, or win some sort of award, but it will make you laugh a few times and appreciate beer pong a little more. The Broken Lizard crew will never top Super Troopers; they can never aspire to be that amazing again. If you are looking for something to match that movie, this is not for you. It does have some great jokes and premises, such as the opening scene with the priest, and the fact that the grandma is a hooker. Take this film for what it is; a flick about getting wasted. Crack open a cold one and enjoy."
3,"Meh... it's been done before, and been done better","I laughed several times while watching this DVD, but then fortunately for me I was drinking while I watched it. I don't think I would have wanted to watch it sober. Completely futile and stupid, but then that's been done before and done much better; those of you who recognize that phrase will know what I'm talking about. Also fortunately for me I bought this DVD used for $7, which is about what I would've paid to see it in a theater once. That's about all it's worth."
5,Just be prepared!,"I had low expectations going into the movie, even though Super Troopers, another Broken Lizard production, is one of my all-time favorite comedies. Happily, I was pleasantly surprised. Of course the jokes are low brow and often ridiculous, but if you enjoy that vein of humor (think any of the Frat Pack movies, ie: Old School, Dodgeball, Anchorman, Zoolander) then you will have a great time!***interesting sidenote, the sound of beer bottles rolling down the aisles in the movie theatre was equally amusing. Apparently, Beerfest etiquette suggests that you to BYOB to the movie!"
2,"Great Video and Audio, Lousy Movie","Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The video quality was great. I give it a 9.5 on a 10 point scale. Some scenes didn't look as good as others. Mostly great.Audio was Dolby Digital 5.1, which was very good. Lots of surround sound and sub-woofer bass.I thought the movie was dumb and boring. I didn't even pause it to go to the bathroom."

2,Did not meet expectations,"After watching over and over Super Troopers and laughing harder each time, I had high expectations for BeerFest but they definitely did not meet them. Heard from my nephew that he thought it was bad also."
2,not the full yard of ale,"The premise is classic--during Munich's Oktoberfest there is a secret Fight Club-like Beerfest involving goofy beer drinking games between national teams of all the beer drinking nations--but the problem is although some bits are gut-busting funny, most are just lame.The play on Das Boot with the captain from said movie in it as the brewmaster of a Bavarian brewery has its moments but is a one-trick joke.Let's just put it this way any movie that has 100 y/o Cloris Leachman playing a grandma who knows how to stroke a sausage is just plain scary. The horror! The horror!Extras are actually decent with one where they do a very clever Monty Python-like animation called Beer 101 on the history of beer.Even so, this is not a classic B movie flick."
5,beer fest,over all i was very happy with my order it showed up on time and was what i order and works very well.
4,what I expected..,"This was bought for my husband, it is what I expected.. for the price and shipping was a great buy.. will def buy more movies in the furture"
3,"RELAX,TURN YOUR BRAIN OFF AND HAVE A BEER!","Well, Beerfest was not what I expected and that is a good thing. I thought it had enough going for it to rate 3 stars. I did laugh out loud a few times and that doesn't happen all that often.....so like my title says............"
1,"Garbage attempt at comedy, with bad actors added in!","So painful trying to force myself through this ruck. The only thing that could have made it better, or worse would have been Will Farrel. Film takes on comical approach at German beer manufacturing and fails at that. Disgusting and though some nice exposed skin is seen, I mean if you are into p0rn then buy it. Sickening is another word, but really this film is just really boring. Anyone that thinks this is a film that deserves high praise also deserves a lobotomy. If you want to dumb yourself down, then watch this. I think I will add Roseanne Barr as a tag for this movie."
1,Snorefest - Strike Two For The Lizards,"OK, I LOVED Super Troopers, I'd rate it a top 3 comedy along with Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin of the last 10 years or so, but after Club Dread and this really bad movie, you really have to wonder if the Broken Lizard team is done. The acting was fine here, but the story was horrible, I mean REALLY bad, as if it were written by a bunch of Jr High kids. Not one real laugh in the whole show. The last 20 minutes are the highlight of the movie, if such can be found anywhere in this show. At least there you can smirk and or gently muse to your self, but no laughing, NO LAUGHING at all. I don't think this movie was as bad as Club Dread, which has to be in the top 10 worst movies of all time, but there is no way I can rate this movie any higher than a 1 star. CD should get a negative 9 stars. I understand that BL is putting together a ST2. Lets hope a return to that formula brings back some comedic chemistery, because the last two BL flicks had none."
2,Olympics of beer drinking?,"Here is a party movie that focuses on all aspects of drinking beer. It is a spectacle of drinking games, drinking contests, getting drunk and staying drunk. Of course, all of this is not exactly what I would call ""impressive."" Therein lies the weakness of this movie.There are a few funny parts in this film, to be sure, but it's just not what I would call a ""well done"" movie, even though it is a party movie. There is very little nudity and there is some ""dark"" humor that just doesn't seem to fit with a party film.There's also the obvious point: films that repeatedly glorify getting drunk are not the best influence for people in their late teens & early 20s. I'm old enough to know that the ""have fun & be happy"" stuff associated in this movie with getting drunk is all nonsense. I was in the Navy & knew a great many alcoholics who were miserable. Am just saying that this movie is a lot like professional wrestling. It's OK to watch, SO LONG AS you realize that it's all fake."
1,Foam Filled Dud,"After looking at some of the other reviews on this site, I am left wondering, ""Did we see the same movie?""This flick is really, really bad. I don't mind Broken Lizard's rude, crude humor-I liked Club Dread-and being a beer geek the storyline appealed to me, but this is supposed to be a comedy, folks, and it was anything but funny. I could even live with fitfully amusing, but this dreck couldn't even reach that low mark.Don't waste your time or money on this one."
4,"Nice price, nice quality","The ankle bracelet is beautiful....but not as thick as the illustration would indicate. My only complaint is with the method of shipment - the USPS. Receipt took forever, and, at one point, the Post Office thought they had lost it and said that -- since it wasn't insured --it wasn't their problem. I would STRONGLY recommend that the seller use UPS ground in the future."
4,Lashed again...,"Lisa Lashes returns to the Euphoria series with this incredible 2 disc mix of HardHouse and Nu-Energy onslaught. If you enjoyed her first outing ""HardHouse Euphoria"" then you will definitely get a kick out of this offering. Lisa's ability to mix such great energetic music with the greatest of ease and precision puts her at the top of the HardHouse DJ set. From the Nu-Energy intro ""Ignition"" by DJ Spoke till the frantic closing of Lab 4's remix of ""Unbelievable"", you will take a trip through Lisa's bag of goodies including Lee Haslam, Untidy Dubs, 12 Inch Thumpers, Anne Savage, Jon Bishop, Paul Glazby and many others. This mix alone proves Lisa is at the top of her game."
5,Great product,"I was looking for a product just like this. Trek and Giant bicycle brands make products very similar to this, but for 3x the money. The assembly was very easy, and attachment to my bike was a snap. My 4 year old loves going on bike rides and has no problem climbing or staying on by herself.Would definitely recommend it to anyone considering spending a lot more money on the expensive brands."
4,Assembly was a little tricky,The child can help pedal or just coast. Be careful if you try to collapse this for storage. My husband cut his finger pretty badly!
3,Wee bike,I purchased the wee bike for my sons 6th Birthday. We enjoy biking together and this will help him keep up with longer bike rides. I have not been happy how the two bikes connect together . My seat is constintently moving I cann't get a tight fit. I would alo like to see a kick stand on the wee bike to help support it when parked. Over all it is a great fun to bike together and I feel much safer with my child behind me when biking.
5,Perfect step after a trailer.,My 5 year old was just too heavy to pull in the trailer. This is perfect as her pedaling really does help move us. This is especially helpful on an incline. She cannot ride a two-wheeler yet and has no trouble with this as my bike holds her up. Easy to hook up and unhook and not too heavy.
4,We ride together now!,"This product is priced relatively low and it arrived very quickly. It was obviously made in China. After I made some adjustments to the wheel and chain guard(shipping damage?), this product has performed very well. Great for kids to learn riding, rules of the road, etc., while they keep up! I recommend this product to parents with kids aged 3 to 5."
4,good for 5 yrs old and up,"Shipping was fast. But shipping box tape was loose, so one tool fell out on the way from shipment. We purchased for 3 1/2 years old girl but it is good for 5 years old which my first one enjoys most. Overall, I'm satisfied."
4,Not bad but be careful with young kids,My daughter and I have riden twice now (she is almost 5) and we both really love spending the time together on the bike. We live in a fairly hilly area so she has more confidence being with me on the trailer bike than on her own bike. I've already taught her to pedal when mommy pedals and not to pedal when I'm not which works out great (especially up hill). My only caution is for younger kids who have no concept of riding on a 2 wheeler--my daughter fell off and skinned her elbow pretty bad. But the trooper she is got back on to get home. We'll go again but hopefully she won't wipe out!
1,hard to secure,I read all the reviews before I bought this product but chose to ignore them because it is cheap. We tried everything to tighten all connections but it just keeps on tilting to the left when my daughter was on. I'm not sure if this is due to the design or I just got a defective one. The money I saved is not worth the hassle of assembly and disassembly we had to do to return this product.
1,Multiple Defective Units,"I purchased this trail-a-bike at Academy Sports and recieved a unit without the attachment for the lead bicycle. After returning it for a second unit, it had the missing part except it was not removable as claimed. After working the unit, I could not reseat the saftey pin. The second unit was rendered unsafe/unusable. I plan to return it tomorrow and go with another brand."
4,gets us to school,No complaints about this well-priced solid co-rider. My six year old doesn't mind the 2 mile ride to school and mom gets some exercise! Seems just as solid as friend's high priced model.
1,safety hazard,"Poorly made. Our first trip out, the co-pilot began clanking after after 45 minutes of biking. We barely made it back home. We returned the product and were given a new one. The second one also broke within the first hour of riding. This time, however, it was extremely dangerous. The brakes locked up and almost threw my son off the bike. Since we were on vacation we brought the co-pilot to a bike shop and were told that a barring was broken, which would cost $40 to replace. DON'T TRUST THIS POORLY MADE PRODUCT."
1,this bike sucks,"My son rode maybe 2 miles on this bike, and from the beginning I had problems with him leaning to one side, almost falling off. By the end the bike started to shake a lot during the ride. We kept on tightening the bolts, but it never helped."
4,"Not great for a 4 year old, but good","My 4 year old daughter fell when the lead bike turned, she isn't an avid bike rider, so she's now a little scared of it. But is very stable when assembled properly - only took about 10 minutes to attach to my bike. I'd recommend it. It's great when we want to go on a long bike ride with my 6 year old and my daughter can't keep up."
1,it came with defect and we could not get replacement,"This does look like a good construction and assembly was very easy. However, when we got it the critical swiwel section was stuck in both directions. The manufacture advised to return for replacement. So we did. Got from Amazon a replacement and the same problem. Had hard time getting a very old lady back on the phone and she resumed: you got a ""lemon"". So I returned to Amazon requesting a replacement. Well, by that time Amazon apparently raised the price for the item and now refuses to send me replacement and instead refunding me money. The explanation: we need to do quality control. That must be a lie because the item is on sale, for the higher price. Amazon appears to quality control me, a customer for over 10 years."
1,OK if you get one that works! 2/3 have not for us.,"Our first one, the pedals/chain were defective and the pedals did not ""drive"" they chain, it just freewheeled backwards or forward. Sent back, got replacement. Replacement has been fine, we use it often.With our growing family, we ordered a second one. This is also defective! The mount and bike-mounting holder do not fit together, it is impossible to take the CoPilot on and off, apparently a welding error or something. So we have to send this back to. Telephone customer service was helping only by saying, ""We can't help you with defective parts. Return to Amazon.""So, one CoPilot has worked fine for 2 years for us, but 2 others have come and gone on the first day due to major, inoperable defects."
1,Poor Quality,We purchased this item because of the bargain price and we got what we paid for. The bike trailer did not trail straight behind our bike and we adjusted it many times. The hook up wasn't the best either. We returned the item (with ease) and went with a Trek tag-a-long. The Trek is definately worth the extra money for it is a much better quality bike. The bike trailer is used by our 4 and 6 year old kids.
1,Wee ride copilot,I haven't had an opportunity to use it because the chain keeps slipping off the gears and I haven't been able to figure out the problem or fix it
5,Love it!,"I just got it yesterday, my 16 years old putted together with no problem. I bougth this for my 4 years old son. We putted the seat all the way down and his able to reach the pedals just fine. We had a nice ride, and he loves it. I'm very happy with my purchase. We are looking foward to a nice spring and summer riding bikes."
2,Some quality issues,"Overall still an acceptable deal for the money for us, but some problems that could be a bigger problem for the less mechanically-inclined:Two of the bolt holes on the mounting bracket were partly chromed over so that one bolt head was already stripped by the factory putting it in a little bit and another that wouldn't go in any further. Smaller diameter replacement bolts with separate nuts solved the problem. The bottom bracket is not quite right. From the factory it didn't turn easily or smoothly. Loosening it up helped a lot bit it took some effort to get it right. The pedals are cheap and do not turn as freely as I would like. Some of the other bolts are very difficult to adjust or turn at all. The unit is functioning well but it is not a high quality piece of equipment by any measure."
3,Reasonable but Not the Best Quality,"The product is reasonable quality. However I had to dissasemble several of the pre-assembled pieces to file/grind pieces of flashing to make the joints between the two bikes articulate as designed. Same for the telescoping ""quick connect"". I wish this was a little better designed and built."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING...UNSAFE. POOR QUALITY.,"We were very disappointed with this bike trailer. My husband (who has an engineering degree and is very mechanical) spent about 2 hours trying to get the hitch bolts to fit together properly. He filed and used a lot of WD40. After finally getting the thing together, it worked okay, but I didn't think it was safe for our 6 year old. Very poor quality control and construction. Not worth the money! We ended up returning it to Amazon.com. We plan to buy a different brand."
1,Unusable!,"This arrived at my house with a big hole in the box and missing the instructions, the pedals and the handlebar hardware. So I went through the effort of returning it to Amazon (since they wouldn't just ship the missing parts to me, no, I had to get an entire replacement. So in the replacement shipment the pedals and instructions were there, but still no hardware to attach the handlebar. So I had to go to my local bike shop and I'm still waiting for them to receive the part, and it's going to be like $50 for this solution. So now summer's almost over and my kid has lost interest (at first he was so excited to ride it and now he just doesn't care). What a piece of garbage!"
2,WeeRide Co-Pilot Bike Trailer,"Our daughter absolutely loves her ""new bike"". She is too big for the bike seat and just not ready to master riding w/o training wheels.The quality is less to be desired. The chain rubs against the guard and everyone hears us coming when she is peddling. Whenever we turn, my bike seat turns with us.....kind of annoying but a small price to pay considering that we can once again enjoy family bike rides together."
2,Beware: WeeRide Co-pilot Bike Trailer Feedback,The area where the bike trailer clamps to the seat post can move and willnot return to the straight position. The adult bike seat can move too.
4,Great buy!,"This has been a great way for the family to bike together. It is easy to assemble--just be sure it is very tightly attached or the co-pilot can swivel sideways while turning. It is sturdy and well-crafted. I see no need to pay hundreds of dollars for other brands. The only complaint I have is that I cannot lower the seat any further to allow my almost 4 year old to reach the pedals and pedal along. (He is small for his age.) If you are looking for an attachment for your young child, I would highly recommend this particular brand."
5,Can't say enough great things...,"My son is Autistic and I just could not get him to try to ride his bike without training wheels. He had become to tall to ride any bike alone with training wheels on it. I like to ride my bike to the gym in warm weather and he loves to go the gym with me as was upset when I would ride my bike and he had to miss out. I also wanted to share all the awesome bike trails we have in our community. I discovered this and we both just LOVE it. It is VERY easy to use, connect and disconnect, folds up to store. Rides smoothly and it turns easily...that was a concern for me. He absolutely LOVES this. The first time we took it for a ride, he began to scream, ""LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME! I'm a big boy!!!"" We spent the summer riding this as much as possible and it helped give him the confidence to finally try riding a bike on his own...HUGE DEAL in our world:) Amazing product!"
5,Love it!,"I ordered this WeeRide Co-pilot on Monday, and it was at my door within 3 days, just in time for some weekend riding! I got this for my 5 year old son so he wouldn't have to try so hard keeping up with me and my 15 year old. I got worried when I saw the box and it said ""Fits most 26-inch bikes."" I own a 29-inch Redline, but it fit just fine. The set-up was easy and my son and I were good to go in less than 10 minutes. We rode about 2.5 miles before it started pouring on us. We went up and down a few hills and at times picked up a little speed, and he had absolutely no problems staying on. He loved it! It was a little weird for me at first, with the whole balancing thing, but you get used to it pretty quick. I definitely recommend this product for family fun, and it's a great way for little ones to get used to riding."
5,Great purchase!,We bought 2 so we could have one at our house and one at my grandson's house. It was easy to put together and is easy to use. We all love it and would recommend it to anyone!
5,love it!,"My kids absolutely love riding on this (ages 5 and 7), so we had to buy two. It took about 45 minutes to assemble out of the box, but attaching it to our bikes was pretty easy. Worth the money - we can bike the trails at our pace with the kids, and they love the ride!"
5,Amazing,"This is a great bike. It gives a kid a sense of freedom, they even feel like they're helping, and it's a great way to never lose your little biker.It goes together in a snap, easy instructions. Attaches easily onto your bike, and folds up in a snap. Get this for someone you know today."
5,so fun!!!,Recently bought this for my daughter and I to go on longer bike rides together. She absolutely loves it! It is a little hard to pull going up hills if she is not helping. Assembly is super easy. Overall a great purchase! Everyone in our neighborhood is getting one :D
5,more time on the open road...less fussing with 6 year old riders,"we just hooked this bike to our tandum and it works great! assembly right out of the box was simple. my 6 year old daughter has trouble reaching the pedals; unless I leave the reflector off, I cannot lower seat low enough, with the reflector left off it would lower just perfect enough with balls of her feet on pedals. this product is awesome for family bike rides, we don't have to keep stopping and fussing with my daughter on her own bike. I love it!!!"
3,For the kids,Bought this for my son-in-law. The box came all smashed up - haven't opened it yet to make sure nothing was ruined. Probably could be packaged better. Looks like a lot of fun for daddy and daughter. I may have to update this after we actually use it. It is December in Michigan so it might be a while!
5,Lots of fun. Excellent construction. Highly recommend.,"Easy to assemble. Made extremely well. When it arrived by UPS, I was worried because the box was destroyed and partially open. Due to excellent packing, nothing was scratched or missing. The quick-release mechanism, although a little ""tricky"" only takes a minute to connect and seconds to disconnect. The ride is stable and comfortable. My 6 year old grandson loves being along with me for the ride. Well worth the money and I highly recommend it."
4,WeeRide Co pilot,"We bought this for an upcoming ride to Downtown Washington D.C, it worked really well and my five year old loves it. My only criticism is that he locking mechanism would be better placed on the underside of the frame."
3,Okay for the money,"For the price it does the job. We have had the bike for a month.Pro's - Cheap. Fits well on adult bike and our daughter loves to go riding.Con's - Flag broke in 3 places on the first ride. The bike trails the adult bike about 3 inchs to the left. Also, the child sits with a lean to the right. (The bike was not perfectly lined up in the rigging when it was welded thus the tilt and dog tracking.)Overall - Bike is fun for my daughter to ride along with us. The lower quality does come with a lower price but should last a years worth of use."
2,Poorly made item.,"Paid for next day shipping, but the item was missing the seat post clamp. So I wasted my money on express shipping. The ""quick connect"" is not all that quick and appears to be over manufactured. When you turn your bike the knuckle is too rigid and turns your entire seat.The rest of the components are under built. Disappointed with this entire unit."
2,2 Stars for now....,Package arrived in a heavily damaged box held together with a roll of packing tape. Left pedal was missing from order. Product itself is well built and my daughter is eager to try it out. The 800 number for customer service at WeeRide does not answer and you cannot leave a message. If I can get them to express me the pedal I will revisit this review because the product itself appears to be quite rugged.
2,"Bought it today, returning it tomorrow","Bought this locally today on sale.Like some of the other reviewers, I was also unable to get the pivot points to pivot. I finally was able to get the up/down pivot screws loosened, which amazingly actually have nothing to do with whether or not the pieces will move. There's simply not enough clearance between the two pieces to allow movement. Some spray lube finally got some up/down motion (if you try hard enough), but attempting the same ""fix"" on the side-to-side pivot resulted in two stripped screw heads and a 6mm allen wrench that's now a little worse for wear. Also, the instructions failed to mention the 5mm allen wrench needed for the four bolts that attach the mounting point to my bike's seatpost.I gave the WeeRide two stars because it looks nice and seems sturdier than the $20-more expensive Schwinn we also just bought (but actually turns when we need it to)."
2,Difficult to attach to my bike,"I found the trailer very difficult to attach to my bike. After attaching the collar to the seat column of my bike, it found it impossible to simply slide on the trailer - it was just too tight. In the end I had to use a hammer to bang the two together, and I probably will never be able to separate them again. I'll probably have to remove the collar from my bike if I ever want to remove the trailer. Poor manufacture."
4,Great convienence!,"I had looked at several different options before deciding on the Wee-Ride Co-Pilot. Some of the other reviews created some doubt, but in the end the other reviews were very helpful in understanding the workings of this bike. My 5 year old daughter loves it. I am FINALLY able to get the excercise that I have been missing since she couldn't keep up on the longer rides. Plus with the cost of gas it is very nice for the whole family to be able to ride to the library, grocery, parks, etc. The Wee-Ride is a great value and is well constructed. I am very excited to be using this on a daily basis!"
4,Very fun product,"We bought this product so that our 3 year old could go along on bike rides. It was easy to set up and we just put those little blocks on the pedals so he could reach better. After a few rides he was pedalling and riding with confidence. Make sure that you are a fairly strong bike rider when pulling one of these because a young rider shifting around in back can really throw you off balance, but I have never crashed. It produces very little drag on the lead rider on flat roads. I only have one problem with the product: when making sharp turns (ie: turning the bike around in the driveway), the connecting joint allows the bike trailer to fall over completely. This has happened several times with no injuries and you would never turn this tight at a high speed, so it is just something to be careful about and another reason to wear a quality helmet. Overall, it is solidly constructed, easy to set up, and we love taking family bike rides with it."
2,buyers remorse for valid reasons,"I should have known when two of the screws were not the right size to send this back. Instead I replaced them at the hardware store and assumed all was well. I've had two issues with the tandem since. The bracket that attaches to the adult bike seat post has come loose on us twice...both times resulting in minor crashes in which the tandem, on even wide turns, essentially falls sidewasy halfway to the pavement. We've learned that we can use the tandem only if we tighten the bracket before each and every outing. That, however, leads me to the second point...my son is rightfully reluctant to go for a ride...exactly the opposite of what this product should be about."
4,pleased but still uncertain,"I have used these successfully for transport of my kayak. The boat loads easily and the rack cradles it well. The racks seem stable on the road. It has taken a bit for me to figure out how best to strap the boat. I've moved away from lines to the bumper and have gone to more robust side to side strapping. Early transport had the kayak moving considerably on the racks. The mounting clamps are not secure enough - nor can they be - to keep the boat from moving on the car's cross braces. Overall, these are still the best I've seen."
3,"It's OK, but could be improved...","The HullRaiser was easy to install on my square factory Volvo rack (which was made by Thule), and seems to be sturdy.The uprights won't lay flat though, so there is significant wind noise without a boat. One thing I don't like is how easy it is to remove. The hand-turned screws can easily be removed, making this an easy target for thieves. A cable lock is mandatory for unsecured parking lots."
1,I don't trust this rack,"I almost lost my boat on the highway with this rack. I have a 12 1/2' flat water kayak. I was driving through a storm with a lot of cross wind. In addition an 18 wheeler was coming in the opposite direction. It is a 2 lane highway. The combination of wind forces bent the forward hull raiser stand and partially freed the front of my kayak. It was displaced about 1 foot. I immediately pulled over. (No following traffic fortunately.) I bent the stand back and tied down the boat again.Now when I use this platform, it is still a little bent and I don't have complete faith in it. I always make sure the tie downs are very tight, but the boat tends to wiggle more now.I'm going to replace it with a Thule that allows the boat to lie flat in its horizontal plane."
5,Great book for contemplation,"During my fast, and contemplation, times and again, I'm drawn to this little book.It is a great book. This little book slowly, bit by bit, through 3 meditations on Christ, directs my mind from the ""secular world"" to Christ. It draws me to silence, to face myself, to God, and to caring for others and hope for the future.It takes me to a journey and after that, I am filled with constance and strength."
5,Simple yet profound reading,I love this book and bought this one as a gift for a friend. Henri Nouwen clearly explains the importance of retreat and time alone to recharge.
1,rip off,Not what it said it was very thin 15in strip not worth the money which i could get my money back and shipping back DON'T Buy this at all
2,Too silly to be taken seriously.,"I know it's made for ""kids"" but using kindergarteners and some obvious first graders (missing teeth) to tell the story of the American Revolution seems silly. I was hoping to see/hear the story of the Revolution in simple terms for kids but not to have the kids as actors. I wanted to use it with my 3rd and 4th grade ESL students. Now that I own it, I'll probably try it, and maybe they will enjoy it more than I did."
2,Too immature,"I teach fourth grade. This was way too young for the age group. Babyish, really. Information and facts were appropriate, but couldn't get past the ""acting""."
2,joan jett on windex,"I'd heard about these guys and was expecting something cool, but this is really a sub-average record. the only thing that gives it any gloss is the harp playing and the work of the rhythm section. The singing is joan jett on windex, pretty screechy stuff with lots of ill-conceived groaning. Lyrically, it's also a problem. Tries to come off all 'rock catharsis' but ends up very bland. you've heard these cliches before. Production could have been better. Guitars have that paper bag quality. Overall, something which tries to be all 'bad' with the ACDC angles, the punkabilly angles, etc, but comes off as just bad. nice try......"
2,Not nearly as helpful as Taber's,"I ordered this book for a medical terminology course I was taking. The definitions are very vague and short. Although it was affordable, I didn't use this book much and I found that Taber's Medical dictionary had much better definitions of words. Many of the definitions were confusing because they were so short. Be aware that the spelling in the book is all European, so you will have a hard time finding words unless you know the European spelling."
2,Dissappointing,"The review by Mark McEntire is fair and informative but I am just going to get to the point, every time I have turned to this commentary for help on a difficult exegetical problem, I have been REALLY disappointed. If you want a light, readable, pastor-focused commentary maybe you'll enjoy this but if you are doing serious exegesis and seek to really grapple with the text and gain insights into the language and argument get Longenecker (Word Biblical Commentary). I seriously wish I never bought this, bland bland bland!"
3,Terrif!,"I usually hate xmas compilations, but this one has a coupla gems. Louis Prima's ""What Will Santa Claus Say (when he finds everybody swingin')"" is so jivin'. AND he wrote it! Also, Duke Ellington's take on that hardened chestnust, ""Jingle Bells"" is impressive. And the jovial call-and-response vocals of ""I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm"" is worth the price of admission alone."
3,Need better description and more sizes,"This ring is attractive and feels good on the hand, but I have two problems with it. First, the description should state that the bands are hollow, not solid, 14k gold. Second, I would like for it to be available in half as well as whole sizes--I wear a 5.5 and ordered a 6, but it was too big, and a 5 is too small."
2,Why can't you find this in WHITE gold????,"I HAVE this in yellow gold. I HAVE it in silver and it is forever tarnishing on me. ugh. WHY can't you find it in WHITE gold?????????????Try doing a search for a rolling ring. Computers don't understand ""rolling."""
2,If it's useful?,"This map might be interesting to look at and see elevations, the peaks, and just the overview of Tahoe Rim trail.But it's going to be quite useless to be taken on the trail because it has NONE of the non-Rim trails (the secondary but good maintained trails) marked there. So, if you plan to stay on the trail for a week doing the whole Rim around the Lake, that's one thing. But if you go on a day hike or want to get off the Rim trail, the map will not give you any idea where to go, what the distance is, and what options you have.I am very disappointed."
4,Very Useful!,"The map is just what it says it is - a map of the Tahoe Rim Trail. It is configured to give trail distance, changes of elevation, camp sites, water sources, trail junctions and crossings. All of this comes in a compact, waterproof package perfect for taking on the trail. If one needs maps of other routes, e.g., ones that include segments of other trails in addition to the Tahoe Rim, then one needs one or more other maps. However, this one is just right for Rim trail hikers."
4,Not a Tourist Brochure,"Britt Montero, a seasoned 30-something crime reporter, works the seamy side of Miami for a major daily. If only half her tales are true of criminals and street people targeting tourists, I wouldn't want to go there, even for a day on the beach. According to Britt and her friends, the producers of the TV series Miami Vice (not actually named) spent millions upgrading dilapidated neighborhoods to make their level of degradation believable for TV audiences. In this stew of crime, heat, poverty, and traffic congestion, Britt uncovers evidence of racially-based police brutality. Pursuing such a story not only would sour her crucial relationship with the police, it potentially could divide the city. It's a trendy story, briskly written to pull the reader along. I couldn't say, however, that it stands out from the crowd of books featuring feisty single women, whose lives are full of people under 40. I listened to the recorded book, ably read by Donada Peters."
4,Enjoyable,This is the second Britt Montero novel that I read from the series and find them enjoyable. The characters are well portrayed and I find Britt and her photographer Lottie to be likable. The action is non stop and the plot is far from predictable.
1,What a yawner!,"I had read a short story by Edna Buchanan in a newspaper Sunday supplement and it was very good. Went into my library and I had a book by this author--pulled it out and read. One of the worst books I have read in the past year! Thank goodness it was short! I kept hoping it would improve, it was like a blueprint for a novel in progress"
2,Most information found online,"Before buying this book, I did research online at various bridal sites. Most of the information in this book could be found online for free! I also found that the majority of the information pertains destination wedding brides who are planning celebrations in tropical places (of which I am not). Some good information, but buy it used!"
2,Basic,This book on CS is broad and so not very involved. It covers the basics and may save you some research time if you don't know much about CS at present.
3,Limited little book,"This is a limited little book, leaves MUCH to be desired. If your looking for ideas and how to make ointments, topicals or what to take, how long to take it etc... you won't find it here."
4,pretty good beginner's book.,"I bought the book hoping I'd finally get a list of all the things CS cures and Heals. What I got was a great introductory book, that explains it all to the beginner. Not exactly what I needed, but hey!!! It works for a friend of mine who is a beginner. So I gave the book to her as a gift, and she loves it. So now I'm going to have to hunt up another book for me, that covers what I need. I got more information from the Internet, for free. But that's how life is.It is a good book, and I don't regret getting it. I just wasn't what I needed.Tianca"
1,Do not buy this pool!,"I bought this pool at Toys R Us for my 2 kids 3 1/2 and 2, and thought that it lookd like a fun pool to have for the spring and summer.On the box it looks huge! You see three kids in it with plenty of room to move around, but in fact the picture is totaly a lie!What a piece of junk. The pool first of all is made out of the same plastic that a beach ball is made from so right off the bat you know that this pool will not last for more than a few uses.Then once the pool is filled up, the side walls dont have the strength to contain the water and keep its shape.The pool is so small! No way can three ""big"" kids fit in this thing and have fun! My two kids had standing room only.To top it all off, the pool only lasted for three days! I tryed to patch it with the enclosed patch with no success. We just ended up putting it out with the trash.Dont wast your money, it looks cool, but it's junk!"
1,Cute but flawed and not worth the $$$$$,"This looks great but has many design flaws. The mast flops over no matter how much air is in it. The slide has no steps and is very unstable, ny son was terrified of it and I had to remove it. It is made of very thin plastic and will not last long and already had a hole in it out of the box. I got the bigger version but it still isn't that big, I would hate to see the smaller one. While my son thought it was cute I didn't think a paying $50 for a wading pool was worth it. When I returned it to Target the guy said ""another one, that's the third one today!"" Don't waste your money!!!!"
1,Save your money,"Bought this for our 2 year old son. Only have had it for about 2 weeks. And it already has holes on the bottom of the pool, and in the corner by the bottom where the flag is. Also the top ring doesn't hold air well. Very cheaply made, not worth the money."
1,What a flop!!!!,I was very dissapointed with this item and returned it!!! It did not inflate enough to keep the back sides standing up...they kept flopping over and covering the slide. We had to tie them town so my son could play on the slide part. It is also much smaller in person them it looks on the photos. There is really not so much room to move around. The water cannon does not turn well and it ends up coming off when it is played with and my son was not able to get it back together on his own so it ended up staying off.I would not recommend spending your money on this one!!!
1,saftey hazard - do not buy!,"The pool was purchased for my 3 1/2 yr old twins. Although they had a great time, the slide is very flimsy even when inflated and installed correctly. My son slipped climbing up and getting on the slide, flipped over, feel head first in the pool and because the slide is tied to the bottom, he got stuck under with his head under the water. Luckily there were 3 adults there watching closely and we pulled him out immediately. We will be returning ASAP."
5,Nobody does it like Mofro,"I'm from the south. I grew up listening to soul, funk, and blues. Mofro's music transports me back to summer evenings in the Georgia of my youth. Sitting around the table with my family over steaming plates of beans, cornbread, and collard greens as the sounds of Ray Charles, James Brown, Otis Redding, the Allman Brothers, Rufus Thomas, and Johnnie Taylor radiated from the living room.Nobody does it better than Mofro. If you haven't yet....See Them Live!!"
5,Mofro grows up,"I thought it would be hard to improve Mofro, but JJ and the boys did it! The earthiness is still there, the great lyrics too, it's just a fuller sound. Listen a few times; I'm sure you'll appreciate the grown up sound too."
4,"Less slick, more funk!","Sounds real old school, really brings me back to the sixties (I am old)What it lacks in polish, it more than makes up for in pure funk.The track, A Woman, brings a tear to my eye and goose bumps in conjuring up the spirt of Otis Redding"
3,"NOT BAD...BUT NOT GREAT, EITHER!","This is a pretty good album...although there is nothing earth-shattering or innovative, here. Several of the tunes were obviously inspired by Otis Redding...although Mr. Grey's voice doesn't have the power that Mr. Redding's did. A few of the tunes had more of a Bill Withers sound. Over all, the musicianship was pretty good and the sound, generally, harkened back to a typical 'Stax-Volt' session from the '60s. The songwriting was fairly basic but serviceable within the context of the format.All in all, though, this album was bit more derivative than I had hoped for and it sounds like Mr. Grey is still in the process of trying to find his own unique musical ""voice"". I suspect that if and when he does, he will be worth another listen."
1,Poor value,"There are five tracks totalling 26 minutes of music. Of these five tracks, three are featured in the original Buena Vista Social Club discs. Effectively therefore, only two tracks, playing for less than eleven minutes altogether, are new. [Such a price] for eleven minutes is truly outrageous...."
5,The most camp fun I've had in years!,"I absolutely loved this movie. Yes Nurse No Nurse takes camp to a whole new level with it's candy-colored sets and and toe-tapping score. With a cast of well-developed, tasty characters, this Dutch film had me improvising the language to sing-along. It even tips its hat to its gay fans with a cute sub-plot to help out a grumpy landlord with a ""happy pill.""All in all this is an adorable camp classic that would leave John Waters salivating for more. Guarenteed good entertainment."
4,A Must Have for Oly C-2020Z Owners,A Short Course in Olympus C-2020 Zoom Photography offers a very easy to follow format. The book takes the reader through the basics of Digital Photography all the way through getting the best results from the C-2020Z.
1,doesn't worth,"Disappointed in both print & issue quality. All came in black & white, not a user friendly design, and doesn't pack in useful tips & tricks."
2,A rare misstep for Babson,"Alcohol figures heavily into the narrative of most Marian Babson books, but I think in this case perhaps the author had dipped into the bottle just a little too much herself. That at least would explain this completely nonsensical story. There is so much in this book that doesn't make sense that I only rushed to finish it so I could write down how much I disliked it. I guess every author has the occasional misstep. This is Babson's, to be sure.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
3,title of review,"I expected something at least somewhat unconventional and interesting based on the title, but the title track is just standard, mediocre lilith fair stuff. I really don't get what she was thinking with the offensive title. Anyone conventionally-minded enough to like the music would be offended by the title, and anyone who found the title amusing or interesting would be offended by the boring conventional music. Track 2 is more of the same. Track 3 has a more developed sound with slide guitar and better songwriting. Track 4 has a slight noisy goth vibe, and she uses her voice more effectively as an instrument, although her enounciation is terrible and it's near impossible to make out a word she sings. The last song reminds me of Billie Holiday. It's completely unoriginal and weak, but apparently it's a cover so I guess that shouldn't count against her. Here's hoping her forthcoming album has more songs like tracks 3 and 4 and less like tracks 1 and 2."
4,"A chilling commentary on ""retirement.""","John D. MacDonald is ruthless. First, he pillories ""community leaders"" whose greed and self agrandizement victimize retirees who flock to the tropical paradise of the Florida keys. Then, just as ruthlessly, he describes the realities of the ""golden years,"" years of disenchantment, boredom, paranoia, disease. Here the master (ask Hiaasen and other younger authors whom he as inspired) turns from his usual genre, the detective romp, to a disaster saga. His Hurricane Ella wreaks havoc on scam artist and mark alike. A very good read . . .a very illuminating expose. Never been disappointed yet with a J.D. MacD. novel"
5,very relavent today,I read this book many years ago and I have told many people about it. I am going to purchase it now to give to my children to read. It is perfectly true even by today's standards. They actually made a mini-series of it back in the day when those were all the rage. I would be interested in seeing that again as well. Just as an aside--he also wrote a very astute book about all the tele-evangelists and this was BEFORE the Jimmy Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart scandals. He was a true visionary. I love the whole Travis McGee series as well.
3,Florida Sold,"Soap opera with depth. This is not a Travis McGee novel. There is a rotating cast of characters all involved in Fiddler Key on the Gulf Coast of Florida. One of the amazing things about McDonald is the depth of his knowledge on such a variety of subjects. In this instance, his knowledge of real estate transactions and the accompanying graft, the science behind hurricanes, and the planning and architecture of buildings. Wrapped around his knowledge of all of these areas is a rotating soap opera of people involved in early commercialization of Florida's Gulf Coast. Makes one whistful for the this bygone area. McDonald does nothing bad."
2,"Whew, I differ from the other reviewers here,","First of all, let me say that I was for years, a zealous John D. MacDonald fan.....I have all the Travis McGee books, and had at one time read virtually everything he had put down on paper. I lived in Southern California for over twenty years and saw orange grove after beach land disappear,,,then I moved to the desert and was utterly dismayed to see it happen there also. So, the message of Condominium is something I feel strongly about. But I thought this book had entirely too many characters to keep track of. I found it confusing, as if I needed to make a chart to follow the action. And I found it predictable."
5,This is a stellar book. PRIME John D. MacDonald,"If you like exceptional writing, a fascinating plot, great dialog and a bit of sleaze, this is the book for you. Condominium is a perfect introduction to the incredible talents of John D. MacDonald. Buy it, read it, and be prepared to become addicted to the work of this great American writer."
1,Dullest MacDonald book ever,"I've liked the 10 or so Travis McGee books I've read quite a lot.With those in mind I picked up 'Condominium'. Wow, what a vast disappointment.MacDonald is a great writer, and he puts all his talent to waste with this detailed, lengthy book about absolutely nothing. Literally dozens of boring characters compete to be the least interesting, while the overall 'plot' (if you can call it that) finally emerges in the last section of the book to be about as exciting as your local weatherman harping about hurricane swells.Do yourself a favor and skip this totally forgettable travesty."
3,Good but not great,"Pucell, over 300 years after his dreadfully premature death, remains among the great composers of his, or any, era. Taking the lamest words and setting them to the most glorious music was apparently all he did, as odes, madrigals, and songs full of the silliest lyrics abound. Yet his music is exquisite. Come Ye Sons of Art was on a sadly never-been-reissued LP by David Munrow, and ranks as one of my absolute favorite recordings. This sounds much like it, but you can hear why a great conductor is great, and why Andrew Parrott is not. Serviceable until I get my LP onto CD, and then never to be listened to again.The funeral music is well played, but too little too late."
5,Fascinating and impossible to put down.,I loved the book and have been waiting for the next ones in the series. When will they be published?
5,Very good,"The dragon was neat, probably my favorite character. It was a very good book but it seemed kind of short. Definitely worth reading a second time."
5,a fantastic story,"this is the best book. I read it when I was nine years old.It was my favorite book for a really long time and still rates pretty highly on a short list. It is a really beautiful book and I have been waiting for a sequel for seven years! I am so glad it finally came out! all I have to say is that if you haven't read it, go read it!"
5,This is amazing!,"I've read this book at LEAST a billion times. This is one of the books that got me started on my never-ending fantasy kick. I love equines, including unicorns and pegusi. I may sound immature, but I'm 12. Forgive me.This work of art is about a young girl named Cara and her journeys in a world connected to ours. This place is where all the 'fantasy creatures' live in almost-peace. To tell you much more would actually ruin the book for you, since you'll find all this out eventually if you read this book.Along with the Harry Potter series, the Animorphs series, Everworld, The Dragonriders of Pern ... this is one of the great series (yes, there's a sequel! Lucky us! It's called ""The Song of the Wanderer"") that children and even many adults will enjoy!"
5,"omg, where do i even start!","Into the land of the Unicorns was, without a doubt one of the best books i have ever read! (it's oonly rival is it's sequel!) From the first page i was drawn into the world of luster. i couldn't put it down. i keep reading it again and again. I have always been a lover of fantasy and this book nearly made me cry because it seemed almost tangible, yet i couldn't actually touch it. Any girl will inspired by cara's heroism. I read this book for the first time a few years ago when i was younger than cara. i'm now her age and she is so like me! i feel like i'm her in some ways. I wish this series would never ever end! god, i doubt i'll ever stop gushing!"
5,Into the Land of the Unicorns,"Dear Readers,I think that this book is very well written. And if you are the kind of person who doesn't read much this book is for you! I have read the book 4 times and still the book surprises me. I think that once you read this book you to will want the chronicles to go on for ever, and when you read this book you will never put it down and never want the book to end. But if you read this book and like it you will probley be very inpasent to read the next book. Because a few years back I didn't like to read but since I read this book I'm reading a whole lot more. Sincerely Curlytop"
5,A truly enchanting book!,"This book is awesome! It is a combination of fiction, mystery, and adventure, and the best part is that there's absolutely NO romance(my kind of book!).Cara, the main character, is an orphan who lives with her grandmother Morris. Abandoned by her parents at an early age, her world is shaken up once again when a mysterious stalker starts hounding her small family-and that's only the first chapter! Her grandmother gives her a special amulet, and sends her to Luster, which turns out to be the land of the unicorns.Within the boundaries of Luster, Cara finds adventure at every turn, and befriends very unique characters, including Lightfoot, a rebellious teenage unicorn.With the help of her new friends, Cara must help to save her grandmother, and the whole unicorn population before it's too late. While doing so, she must discover whether blood is really thicker than water, and the outcome could be potentially dangerous."
5,"FANTASTIC, A MUST READ","I read Into The Land of the Unicorns when I was in 5th grade. I was never into the whole fantasy thing, but I thought, well why not? Once read, it immediately became my favorite book. The story pulls the reader into a world of fantasy and wonder. One can not help but be ensnared by the books' web of magic. The allegory is fantastically and delicately woven, from the uniqueness of the characters to the surprisingly captivating plot. The imagery in this book is excellent and so is the tale of Cara and her mystical friend Lightfoot. The reader will be held hostage till the last crinkley page is turned. I highly recommend Into The Land of the Unicorns to you. I can not describe with words how I have enjoyed it, words may tarnish the feeling. You may even find a new part of yourself...that is how deep the ""story"" goes."
5,Not Sappy!,"A lot of people think this book is really sappy.It's NOT.They say the unicorns are gentle and kind.That is kinda true.They can be fierce if need be.This book pulls you into a world of magic and wonder.The characters are fascinating!Coville describes everything in such detail!The trilogy was left unfinished.It's not Coville's fault!You don't find as many good books like this one much anymore.I'll give anyone who reads this review, buy these books!I have read each book twice-so I know what I'm talking about.READ THESE BOOKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Unicorns Are they real??,"I think this book is a great book because, the charactors seem so real. I feel I am the little girl who is in the story, and what she goes through I can see it and feel it. I think it deserves five starts because the author is a good writer. He knows how to write and express what is going on in the book. I do recommend this book to any one who wants to read it. It is a wonderful book that I have enjoyed twice. Many more times will come that I will want to read it again."
5,"An ageless tale, to be read and reread","I'm almost fourteen now, and I still love the book I bought when I was ten. It's an ageless tale, told classically by Coville in the traditional spirit. Its simplistic language, clear defining of characters, and poignant plotline are intriguing. Rarely have I seen a book for young readers told with such minstrel ease and epic flavour. I love it. It deserves a shrine on the bookshelf."
1,OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!,AAAAAAAGH!!!!!.It haunts me in my sleep. Little strange people dorky girl.I wish I could put it in my microwave and bake it. AAAAAAAGH!!!!! I won't say another word.
5,A Classic,"I read this book in the third grade and have reread it a dozen times since. I love the different creatures, the creative stories, and the possibilities that this first book provides. And as it is a children's book, the poor writing must be forgiven. A warning, though: I would not recommend this book for a child under the age of 10 or so; the opening scenes are scary for young children and the father-daughter relationship is rather disturbing."
5,Unicorns are they real??,"I think this book is a great book because, the charactors seem so real. I feel I am the little girl who is in the story. And what she goes through I can see it and feel it. I think it deserves 5 stars because the author is a good writer. He knows how to write and express what is going on in the book. I do recommend this book to any one who wants to read it. It is a wonderful book that I have enjoyed twice and many more times will come, that I will want to read it again."
5,A GREAT BOOK FOR UNICORN LOVERS!,"This was a great book. Sometimes I liked to stop when I was tired and eventhough I was tired, I still wanted to see what Cara, Lightfoot, the Dimblethum and the Squijum's new adventure would be. I am reading the second book now. I recommend this book to anybody!"
5,"Great Book, recommended for all aspiring leaders",Great story of a real Marine. Captivating story with Leadership Lessons at every turn.
4,Can't figure out what's on this CD? Here's the list:,"I ordered this CD without having a clue as to what was on it (with the exception of the track by Kajagoogoo). Luckily, it's pretty good! Here's the 10 tracks found on the CD: ""It's My Life"" by Talk Talk; ""Words"" by Missing Persons; ""Kids in America"" Kim Wilde; ""She Blinded Me with Science"" Thomas Dolby; ""Turning Japanese"" by the Vapors; ""Don't Cry"" by Asia (which I still don't recognize); ""Call Me"" by Blondie; ""Sunglasses At Night"" Corey Hart; ""Lunatic Fringe"" by Red Rider; and ""Too Shy"" by Kajagoogoo. And, the sound quality is actually really good! Not a bad CD for 6 bucks. :)"
2,A Half Hearted Collection,"Ten measly tracks is all you get on this halfhearted collection of 80's new wave hits. Only two of the songs, ""Turning Japanese"" by the Vapors and ""Call Me"" by Blondie are essential and one track, ""Don't Cry"" by Asia doesn't even belong here as it doesn't really qualify as New Wave but more as the type of arena rock that punk new wave was supposed to be rebelling against."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this book but the other Chic Simple wardrobe books are better. This edition outlines too many things to be of much use: fashion trends over the eyars, clothes for sports, women, men and children. Unfocused."
5,Blown away!!!,"I have only three efforts by Eric Gales and I must say, I listen to him more than any other in my extensive music library. His title track, ""Psychdelic Underground"", went back to the days of Jimi Hendrix. The man is truly a master at his craft, and I wish the airwaves would give him a shot. Eric is a force to be reckoned with. Not only does he play the blues, with a true passon, his rock shows just how versitile he is. I'm throughly pleased with having him in my library and look to expand upon it."
2,"The weakest entry (and not surprisingly, the last)","Having read and enjoyed the first two books, I hunted down a copy of this one, and was terribly disappointed.It reads very much as if someone else wrote it from Horowitz's outline, contradicts various elements from the first two books, doesn't have the humor, and is fairly flat. As a stand-alone book, it would be all right, but it doesn't mesh at all with the first two books in its series."
3,New- Raven's Gate!,"I haven't actually read the books yet because I wasn't born when they came out, but I wanted to share the fact that Anthony Horowitz has re-written them! He has renamed the series 'the gatekeeper series'. The first one 'Raven's Gate' has already been published, and is almost identical to 'The Devil's Doorbell' except for Martin's name being changed to Matthew and several other details being altered. I am now going to read the 2nd book.On Horowitz's website it says that there were meant to be 5 books in the old series, but that he never finished them so the series actually ends with the 4th book- 'The Day of the Dragon'. Hopefully , this time round he will finally complete the series and we will all get to find out what happens to Martin/Matthew."
3,Pyle PLMR52 5.25-Inch Marine Speakers,"These don't sound bad for the price. They just are not 5.25"" speakers. They are 5"" speakers masquerading as 5.25"" speakers. I bought them to replace 5.25"" speakers on a boat and they don't quite fit the location, about a quarter inch too small. I added a trim ring to cover the edge, but that was an added expense of $35 for 6 rings (3 pair of speakers were being replaced) that was not in the original budget. Since these are on a boat, they will only last a couple of years before needing replacements. I will probably order these again, considering I already have the trim rings and they sound ok for the price."
4,Sound is good,"We put these on a 1992 Stratos boat and have enjoyed them a lot, the sound is clean and and good output."
4,dvd,This is a good movie. Shows that something can be done about what goes on in this world that shouldn't.
5,inportant to watch,everyone should watch this movie. it informed me about human trafficking but had other things going on as well.
2,Pieces,"When was the last time someone tried to read a story to you by reading a little piece of each chapter rather than going chapter by chapter? Can't figure it out? Neither can I, there are some rarely glimmers of light in the many stories in this film but it lacks the gravity because it's so disjointed. Nothing against Mira Sorvino but would you really expect a victim of childhood sexual assault to be so calm and seemingly unruffled through the movie? Or that a goon wouldn't recognize her from a surveillance attempt? Nothing against the actress but I would say that Donald Sutherland eclipses her in believability and his interrogation is pathetic. You'll get better questioning watching Law & Order. So while it may be a decent attempt, on the psychological, emotional heavy hitting material side of things - HT sadly misses the mark."
2,Soap opera,"The international traffic in human beings is a disgrace as is this movie. The script is atrocious, maudlin, and implausible. Robert Carlyle does a good job of playing the head of the crime organization, but Mira Sorvino as the ICE agent looks and acts like a beagle. If you are looking for a credible story/drama about human trafficking, look elsewhere."
4,Great,"A world problem is approched in the view of the four kind of people that take part on it : The victims of sex trade, the people that trades this women for benefit the customs agencies on the world that tries to stop them and the families of the victimsAll in all a great miniseries perfect if only they would have cast somebody else as Kate Morozov, honestly I don't see how anybody will believe Mira Sorvino as a Ukranian-American somebody else would have done the trick. Donald Sutherland on the other hand as her boss excels., but the greatest performances come from Isabelle Blais & Laurence Lebouef (who play the victims) honestly they are outstanding.Is an honest, brutal and harsh look onto one of the biggest problem the U.S. and the world deals with today. don't miss it"
4,liked it,really good sleeper type movie. shows some of the terrible things that happen in real life.. Love Mira Sorvino in this movie.
2,I feel sorry for the author so that's why it's a 2 star,"The Green Book was a rather short book with a weak , unrealistic and childish plot. I am sure that a younger person such as a 7 or 8 year old might enjoy it more than i did because it has alot of stuff that only kids would enjoy. I would give it a one but i gave an extra star to the author who spent their time writing this book even when they could be doing something much more productive. Here is my bit of advice: Save your money (your local library might come in handy here)"
1,ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!!! DO NOT READ IT!!!,"When I was in 5th grade we had to read THE GREEN BOOK with out class. It is one of the worst books that I have ever read! This unrealistic, rediculus, and pointless story is a waste of time. I am sorry that I wasted my time reading it...don't waste yours!"
4,Wonderful,"I believe that ""The Green Book"" protrays a childs point of view in a new environment almost flawlessly. The plot was origional, the content inspiring, and the imagination intense. I would recommend this book to almost anyone."
3,Wll Pattie and her family survive on Shine?,"I rate this book a three star book. I rated it this because it could have been longer and it could have had a better ending. The characters are Pattie, Joe, Father, Malcolm, Guide, Sarah, Jason, and Jasons mother. A hand picked group got to go on a space ship to another planet because the earth is dying. They all got to take one book with them. Pattie who was to young to understand what they were doing picked an empty journal and when they needed it to write in they found... To find out what they found read this book!"
3,"A very good book..not a great one, but still a very good one","This is a very good light sci-fi book. While it is written for young adults, those somewhat older may enjoy it as well. My problem with this book, is that is seems as though everything (the characters, environment, etc)is not gone into deeply enough. I also felt like when the book ended, that it didn't really have a feeling of completion, sort of like it was over too quickly...the same feeling one gets when watching a movie that seems as though it all of a sudden ran out of budget."
3,It was O.K.,I thought this book was O.K. but it was not the greatest. The Reason it was not the greatest because is very confusing. It was confusing because it skipped around a lot. That's why I rate this book 3 stars.
1,You will not enjoy it,"The Earth is being destroyed! So Pattie her family and many others join in a spaceship to another planet forever. When they laded they saw nothing, nothing expect grass, a wonderful beach. But when they stepped out of the spaceship the grass cut there feet, and the beach had only big green jellyfish, and the water stayed still. Their was no food exept vegtiblaes and wheat, but they were going bad. When the children went out for a walk they found this tree candy from the tree, that was the only food. Then they found theses rocks, they moved, and then moth people came out of them, but they didn't talk. Find out what happened to Pattie's family and if they survive. I rate this book 1*."
3,The boring book,"I think that on a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give The Green Book a two. I would give it a two for many reasons. First, it was boring. It put me to sleep five times! The only part I like is when the kids saved everyone. That only happens a couple of times. It just wasn't my kind of book. I love scary books. Did you like The Green Book? Megan W."
5,excellent futuristic book!,I liked The Green Book because it was futuristic One reason it was futuristic was they traveled to another solar system in just 4 years! I recommend this book to anyone who likes futuristic books.
5,A must read for all residents of planet earth,"This book was simple but full of suspense and excitement on every page. It illustrates the basics of political science, a Mayflower compact for space colonizers, the exploration of a new ecosystem, but most of all, it is just fun to read. It is also a great allegory for the future residents of the new, unpredictable and more localized earth that global warming and post-peak oil production are creating. I can't praise this book too highly."
4,Teacher Review,My teaching partner and I both feel this is a good book to use to teach the genre of Science Fiction.
5,Mrs. Alexander's Class,"Jill Patton Walsh has successfully written a book about a book! In this story she traces the journey of a small band of people as they journey to a new planet from a dying planet Earth. However, the most noteworthy piece of this story is how children who read this book learn the importance of journal writing and recording history. The subtlety Walsh uses to weave the almost thoughtless way the travelers selected the books that would be taken on the journey to the surprise revelation of the existence of Pattie's journal as a recorded history of the beginning of their new life on the planet is nothing short of masterful."
5,Ten+ years and counting...,I read this book for the first time more than ten years ago in a second or third-grade gifted and talented class. It's stayed with me all that time and is without a doubt one of the most formative and definative works of literature I've ever read. I can recommend this without any hesitation at all for any reader of any age.
5,An intelligent summary of chaos.,"Mr. Hoppenstand takes us deeper into the fires of our own disturbances with Clive Barker's Short Stories: Imagination as Metaphor in the Books of Blood and Other Works. In this book, Hoppenstand carefully dissects one of the most interesting minds of our time, and uses his work for a reflection on the current state of our society.Barker is usually thought of as a chotic and violent storyteller, and while that may be true to some extent, Hoppenstand offers his own insight and perspective to show a tender motive behind the blood. In this light it is easy to understand how a poet resides in Barker's turbulent imagination. For those wishing to get more out of madness, Hoppenstand has provided us with a tool for understanding ourselves, and the actions of others."
3,"Nice to have an extra to sync at work, but overpriced.","I bought the extra cradle so I could sync at home and at work, and this does the job for that. However, the price is too high... more than other manufacturers cradles cost. And this one is smaller and flimsier than all of them. Only positive thing is that it does come the AC cord, so that gives you two that you can take with you on a trip for charging."
4,works great,"it is very heavy , but then it is cast iron .flimsy oven racks probably wouldn't hold it ,but mine does .Can proform a variety of tasks , smoke ,steam basting ,does great for fish ,tender ribs , will try more and report . Personally ,I like it ,thou it could be cheaper as I am sure that the Chinese only get $0.50 to a dollar for it ."
3,Not The Wreckers,"This CD is not an official Wreckers release nor is it Michelle Branch and Jessica Harp. It is exactly as it is titled, a tribute being performed by somebody else. The artist is named as Stewart Michaels but I would assume that this is the person that compiled/mixed the recordings as the vocals are female. Both the instrumentation and vocals are performed pretty well so if you like The Wreckers songwriting it is not a bad collection addition."
4,Tourist map,"I didn't realize that this is a tourist map, not a full map of DC. I live in DC and wanted a map for my car, but it doesn't even cover anything north of Woodley Park. Not what I needed."
1,Watch out! Does NOT reflect 2005 law changes!,I bought this without realizing checking the copyright date - note that it does not reflect the big changes to the bankruptcy laws that took effect about a year ago!
5,Now everything is close,I was pleasently suprised with this product. Assembly was simple and intuitive. I've used it camping and in the backyard for grilling and BBQ. It's saved many steps for needed items and holds everything you could use including a lantern for evening or night cooking.It's sturdy and it appears I will have this helping hand for a long time.
5,A Bear Dancing to a Classic,"There are two reasons to learn French: The first is to finally understand the brilliance of Jerry Lewis' French translator and the other is to enjoy this book in its native tongue. How much more effete are words translated from one language to another, one culture to another and one age to another? . Was it not Flaubert himself in this book who so accurately described the impotence of words? Those who would condemn this book as sexist maudlin melodrama perhaps miss this one simple and timeless point - no matter how well you think you may understand others, or make yourself understood, language is limited and ultimately fails"
5,Final Showdown,"The final fight is super cool and I can safely say that I am not at all disappointed. These five episodes keep you glued to your seat. Shishio seems to be an invincible [dude], but he is human after all. Well, I think he's a freak of nature. Anyway, the Kenshin gumi gives their all, but is it enough? You have to find out yourself, [right?]. Buy this now or [ELSE]! ..."
4,Time Remembered,"Novelist Anthony West -- the illegit son of Rebecca West & HG Wells -tells what it was like growing up with two famous, and famously divided,parents. The book so infuriated Mommie dearest that she vowed to sue anypublisher who printed it in the UK. It didnt get published there untilafter her death -- 30 years after US pub. A fascinating book, written- as fiction - with fierce insight and urbanity."
5,Very thorough and eye-opening,"Clive Ponting has put a great deal of research into this book. So much ground is covered that it's hard to do justice here; very thorough. If you think our civilization isn't vulnerable to collapse, you might need to rethink your position after reading this book."
2,"much good info, but incomplete facts","When I read this book for my college environmental science class, I thought it was fascinating and ground-breaking. Picking it up 6 years later, however, I realize how much is missing. I re-read the first chapter on Easter Island, and wondered, ""where is the account of disease?"" Contrary to Ponting's claims, the Easter Island civilization did NOT collapse as a result of over-use of resources! In fact, it recovered from this mistake, only to be devastated by syphilis and small pox, brought by the Europeans.Instead of using Easter Island as a warning to the rest of the world, Ponting should use it as a message of hope. If Easter Islanders could recover from severe resource degradation- so could we. The key is recognizing the problem in time and working actively to resolve it."
1,"incomplete facts, needs an editor, cant stay on subject","man abuses our environmentthere, now you dont have to sit throug 400 pages of ranting about how statistics are proving we destroy our environment. If you need this book to realize we are a destructive race; well then maybe you should read it, its so repetative you are bound to get the idea."
5,"The plot may be formula, but the filming makes it first rate",The Android Invasion is a very fun Tom Baker story. The village setting was an excellent location for this creepy story. The outside location shots give parts of this story a cinematic feel. The return of the UNIT makes this story even more interesting. A definitive Tom Baker era story.
3,"""Is that finger loaded?""","The Doctor and Sarah land on what appears to be Earth, in the town of Devesham. But not all is right, a soldier falls off a cliff, only to return to a pub minutes after his death. All this and more in Terry Nation's second non-Dalek script. The story, at times, can be very irritating, and tedious. There are too many flaws(Crayford never taking his eye-patch off, ect). But on the other hand, there are some enjoyably scenes. The location footage REALLY helps this one, a semi return of UNIT(sans Lethbridge-Stewart), and some great humor(which also really helps). With a few more helpful and clever explanations, this could have been a lot better."
1,Worse than the Candy-man and the 6th Doctor put together!,"I don't remember this tale being funny or original. I never thought I'd say this about Doctor Who, but what a bunch of pants! When I placed this along side my other Doctor Who videos, they started to turn green! Memorable only for the Sarah-Jane's googlie-eyed android doppelganger! Otherwise instantly forgettable. Besides the bad taste that is.Sorry Tom. (and he's usually so good!)"
4,I knew you weren't the real Sarah Jane,"Another great Tom Baker episode with everyone playing a doppleganger. Tom's acting is wild and unexpected as always. Elizabeth Sladen gives another stearling performance as Sarah Jane Smith. Harry Sullivan, UNIT, aliens taking over the workd, what more do you want?"
4,A good work of comparative planetology,"Besides a excellent historical and scientifical synthesis of the Venusian system, this book does a good job at comparing the three main terrestrial planets, from the astronomical, physical, geological, atmospheric, etc. point of views. This is very refreshing because Venus is often overlooked in most books, that usually focus more on the binary comparison of Mars vs the Earth, and, in many ways, Terra is actually closer to Venus than Mars.The text itself is clear, accurate and very entertaining to read (especially the footnotes!). Everything is based on scientific facts, except the last chapter, that digresses a little too much from the main subject, but it's ok."
4,"Venus Revealed: Good Science, Bad Jokes","'Venus Revealed' gives a good summary of what we know, what we might find out, and what we thought we knew about Venus. The book contains enough solid, meaty science for the knowledgable reader and enough basic background to let the less knowledgable keep up. But the author works too hard at keeping it fast and funny. About the middle of chapter two he discovers that footnotes can be used for comedy asides and wisecracks. This gimmick is only funny the first hundred times. Mercifully, the jokes die down near the middle of the book. Maybe the author regained his own interest in the topic. A good book, with a lot ofhard data on Venus in easy-to-read form, but I recommend skipping the footnotes."
3,Great bag....for a few months anyway.,"Loved this bag when I got it at my baby shower. After 3 babies with mediocre diaper bags, I wanted a great one for my 4th baby. Great organization in this bag, looks so cute.Has NOT held up well! I use it every day, but not roughly. Trips to the store, etc. Fabric is ripping and it faded A LOT after washing according to the directions. My baby is only 9 months old and I'm ready to retire this bag. Diaper bags should last until the baby is out of diapers, don't you think?"
2,"Super cute, but flap can't be secured.","I thought this was super cute when my mom gave it to me, but I am not 6 months in and am looking for a new bag. When you have it loaded up, you cannot secure the flap and it is rather inconvenient."
5,One Choice Book.......4 thumbs up....ok....2 thumbs up,"KILLER...I would say this book, is D best I ever read...I just picked it up cause of the cover..Yeah, i judged it by its cover...and I was right...."
3,Infernoerno- aka..Zombieaholic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I like just about every zombie book I read and found this book average. It is a good read and is different than the usual zombie title and is pretty graphic. If you are looking for something to read and is pretty decent this is your book.
3,Typee,Easy and fun reading. Nice to read words that were written so many years ago.I read a bit about Herman Melville and it prompted me to read some of his works I've not previously read.
1,Not as good as it shows online,It is not as good as looks online. Neither does it feel like Cashmere.
4,An engaging novel about lesbian parents,"I am so sick of reading the same lesbian novels over and over again. Coming out stories. Predictable romances. So it was really nice to read a lesbian book that was about something other than *being a lesbian*. There were good complex characters and enough plot to keep me turning the pages. Really nice visual images too, done in a way that didn't annoy or slow things down too much.All in all a satisfying read!"
2,Real Life Dracula,"This shlocker attempts to shed light on the historical Vlad Tepes or Vlad the Impaler, the basis for the Dracula legend. dracula is Romanian for the Devil. Vlad Tepes ruled Transylvania in the 1400s as a war lord, impaling rival armies around Hungat and Romania earing him the name The Impaler. The book is just a retread opf stuff I got on the History channel. The historic Tepes was butchered for commerial print in novels and films, lasting even into the 2000s. We view our devil Dracula Vlad the Impaler Tepes as a folk hero. I remember when that stuff was scary before I got into horror films and hiostoric neo gothicism."
1,In Which Nursing Home Do You Live?,"In Which Nursing Home Do You Live?Angel Perfume reeks of chocolate-scented bathroom air freshener & some kind of orthopedic shoe powder with a Godforsaken undercurrent of nursing home pastries. Have some self respect, my friend; whatever your age, you are too young for this aroma..."
4,Revelatory,"I borrowed this book from a friend thinking it would help me to better communicate with others when I disagreed with them - how to speak the truth in love, etc. I got so much MORE than I ever expected. Backus exposes lies that we believe in about ourselves and others and makes a way for the Holy Spirit to bring change. I am now so much more aware of how easy it is for me to fall into manipulation (based on fears and lack of trust in God) instead of simply speaking the truth. It is an eye opener and I'm really grateful to have read it. I plan on buying several for our home-group as Christmas gifts because we can ALL benefit from his insights."
5,Great book.,"This is a great book. You instantly become attached to the character that you are presented with. It is a heartfelt read that is more than a good book. It is not a masterpiece, but it is pretty good!"
1,Does not work wtih Palm OS 5,"The add should be clearer. I had High hopes on using this camera with my new Sony PEG TG-50 but after installing it, getting errors & going through 2 round of questions with Sony support I was told that the camera does not work with the Palm OS 5. A real disappointment for those who bought the TG-50 or are thinking about upgrading to the newest Palm OS."
4,Unique insights - As always,"I bought this book because I wanted to better understand the Psalms. They are often quoted in the New Testament and seem at once to be beautiful and confounding. C.S. Lewis approaches these works in a way that may seem sacrilegious to some. But for, his honesty and insights came shining through. I will never read them again without thinking more deeply, smiling at his analogies and feeling a greater connection to God."
3,Good but odd.,CS Lewis is always good but here he eschews the Christ-centred reading of the Psalms in favour of psychology and that results in very odd conclusions such as the presence of demonic lurking in the Psalms.The reader needs to be aware of this and consult a Christ-centred reading of Psalms such as Patrick Reardon's Christ in the Psalms along with this book.
2,"Lewis' work is great, but the book is too expensive","As in the title, this work of Lewis is great. His reflections on the Psalms are challenging to the serious Christian. It deserves five stars.I have rated it poorly because of the printing of the volume. Even with the discount from Amazon.com, this book is WAY too expensive. Harvest Books simply issued an earlier printing. They did not bother to re-set the type, fix minor typographical errors, and publish it as their own book. The effect is that they bound a photocopy. What is more, they printed it on cheap paper that readily tears.If you're looking for a bound photocopy of a great work, then this is the book to buy. Otherwise, save your money - go to your local library and make your own photocopies."
3,"CS Lewis, reflections","Wordy, but flowing in time-honored tradition of CS Lewis. have not read it in-depth, but is a reference book that needs to be read front to back and absorbed."
1,Very Dodgy!,"I didn't get very far with this book because his ideas were so dodgy!When talking about the imprecatory Psalms he described the imprecations as devilish and sin on the part of the Psalmists. I decided I'd give him a chance to redeem himself with the rest of the book and read on.In the next chapter he went on to say the Psalmists did not believe in life after death. After reading this I had had enough.If you're looking for enlightenment on the Psalms, keep looking!"
2,Heavily colored by higher criticism,"Most of the time I love C. S. Lewis. Even when I disagree with him he provides food for thought. However, I was cringing through most of this book. Lewis did not hold an especially ""high"" view of Scripture, and his belief in dynamic inspiration (the Bible contains divine truth, but is by no means free of human errors) is very much on display in this book. He also accepts ideas derived from higher criticism in how he describes the development of the Jewish religion, the mechanics of typeology in the messianic Psalms, etc.The chapter on praise was excellent and though-provoking, but that and the introduction were the only parts of the book that I found to be worth reading. The assumption of an error-prone Bible and quasi-pagan Jewish religious development heavily color the exposition in most other parts of the book. If you believe the whole Bible to be equally the Word of God, this book probably isn't worth your time or money."
5,Reflections on the Psalms,"This book is a thought-provoking discussion of experiences and difficulties the author has met while reading the psalms. I enjoyed reading one chapter, then reflecting on the psalms mentioned for myself before going on to another chapter. The book is small enough to take on the commuter train for an absorbing read. I plan to reread sections."
3,Not what I expected,"Probably my fault, but I was looking for a more detailed account of specific Psalms, rather than general aspects of all of the Psalms. A useful scholarly reference but not at all what I was looking for."
1,Horrible Imitation of Music,"When I first heard about HIM, I was told enthusiastically that for anyone who grew up on The Mission, Sisters, Fields of the Nephilim, et cetera, this was a must-have. So, I eagerly downloaded a bunch of songs as a taster. And my reaction was - this is truly atrocious. It sounds like Paradise Lost watered down with Clay Aiken. The vocals are poor to midling, the lyrics ridiculous, and the music was very, very limp. It reminds me very much of the horrid second wave of G*th bands in the 80s - Rosetta Stone, London After Midnight, etc.To any fans of this, I would highly recommend you check out ""Symbol of Life"" from PARADISE LOST. It is the best example of a modern version of this genre of music that I have found in recent years. Otherwise, check out the originals that obviously inspired this band - Sisters of Mercy ""Vision Thing,"" The Mission ""Children,"" Fields of the Nephilim ""Elyzium,"" Red Lorry Yellow Lorry ""Blow,"" Christian Death ""Only Theatre of Pain."""
5,A NEW MOVEMENT,"I hope there are more ""Love Metal"" bands to come that are like H.I.M. The lead singer has a very melodic voice that just adds to the great music that has been written. Can't wait to get the old albums!!!"
5,GREATEST BAND & BEST ALBUM OF ALL-TIME!!!!!,"I encourage everyone to buy this album. This is by far the best CD I have ever bought and the best band I have ever heard. It's romantic, raw, edgy, and hopelessly addictive. I also recommend all other HIM albums. BUY IT NOW!"
5,Great Gothic Band,"Yes, I said it, Gothic. Gothic ways always implied love and death, such as William Shakespear. They are truely Gothic. Anyway, it's a good thing Bam has been promoting this band hard core, because I heard of them before, and tried to get some people to hop on the bandwagon, but failed. Thanks to Bam, tons of people are HIM crazed now, and they have every right to be. Their musically is simply so amazing, and genuine you can hear it in Ville's vocals. One of my personal favorite songs ever has got to be ""Join me in Death,"" which reminds me of, again, a piece of literature Willian Shakespear could have written put into song form. A must have for anyone who respects anything a bit different."
4,Near perfect HIM album,"This is HIM's 2nd album but it is an alternate release of ""Razorblade Romance"". It has two tracks from their debut release; ""Greatest Love songs Vol 666"", : Your sweet 666, and Wicked game.And it's missing three tracks that are on the other ""Razorblade Romance"" version. But to make up for the missing tracks we get 6 previously unreleased live tracks.This album is truely amazing but it's just a step behind their third and fourth releases: ""Deep shadows..."" and ""Love Metal"".But don't get me wrong this is still one of the best cds I have in my collection. These guys are very talented and should be recognized here in the US.Also this album will be released officially in the US in a few weeks. But it' won't include the 6 bonus tracks so you're better off buying this one."
5,HIM,this is probably my favorite HIM album. i love every song and i love the front cover and the artwork so much. i have a poster of the front cover on my door. this album is the first one i got by them and i suggest you all buy it. i would give this album a million stars but it only lets me go to five. BUY IT!
5,Awesome,"This CD... it is awesome. It is like 80's-like, and is just good. some songs are kinda bad, but it is all in all good! Oh, and guy who typed the huge review... never, NEVER, insult Korn."
5,Awesome,HIM is the best band in the world. This cd is awesome too. I love all the songs and razonblade kiss is an awesome song. CKy for like Element for life BAM for life.
3,Metal meets AOR,"HIM has a such a unique sound of their own that it is pretty hard to describe it with just few lines here. The best way to get an idea of what they're all about is to think about Survivor (""Eye Of The Tiger""), Europe (""The Final Countdown"") and Mötley Crue (Girls,Girls,Girls) put together. In other words they're as melodic as AOR groups were in the 80's but their sound is lot harder. Another unusual conflict that they have in their sound is Valo's soft Cure-like voice that is layed on top of full texture hard rock bed.Razorblade Romance is an album with unfortunately not too many radio frendly cuts. As a matter of fact ""Join Me"" is album's only track that has any potential to make it on the pop charts (It was already nr.1 hit in Germany, Austria, top 10 in Swizerland and currently breaking out in Spain ). I believe that this group has a chance to make it real big but it may not be until their next album comes out."
3,For the HIM-obsessed only,"With half the disc being less-interesting versions of songs Ville's come out with before, this disc is only for the truly hardcore-fans of HIM. I still enjoy listening to this CD from time to time, and there are some OK songs on the disc that I hadn't heard of before, but if you're looking to expand your HIM Horizon beyond ""Join Me"" and ""Wicked Game,"" this disc is not for you. If you're looking to delve into remakes and a few extra newbies (which aren't as good as his typical stuff, IMHO) then maybe you might get something out of this one. But I have to say..this isn't his best one."
4,I dont know what to say,"First of all, i like this cd, i got started on HIM from hearing 'join me' and it sounds a lot like glam rock from like the 80's and okay its nothing really new. Pretty shallow, seems to be marketing to teenage girls, and its not really that 'innovative', but i'd be lying if i said i didnt like this CD. I dont think its goth, really i dont, i think its just rock music in which they just happen to wear some black, and i think its pretty easy to see that. Good rock to listen to, catchy as hell, but obviously its not very meaningfull."
5,FINALLY,"I have been a huge HIM fan for the past 2 years...and finally, the second U.S. release of Razorblade Romance...buy it...thats all i can say...no matter what music you listen to..buy this album...you wont regret it!"
5,Best Cd Alive,"I am In Love with this Cd. Ville's killer vocals are amazing, and the guitar is awesome. My favorite songs so far are ""Join Me In Death"" and ""Death In Love With Us."" You really should buy the CD.If youre a big fan of HIM, deifnitely spend that obscence amount of money."
3,not 4 me,"I remember when I bought this cd right after it came out here in italy 'cause of the good reviews. I was a bit disappointed. Howevere I could completly understand all the good words . They have a unique sound,great melodies,etc.., but I just didn't like the songs. I listened to poison girls 5 or 6 times and then I forgot about it for about 2 years. Then I discovered cky and I was completely blown away, and soon I discovered that many ""cky"" fan became ""him"" fan also. I am a cky fan but I don't like him at all and really can't make any connections between the two bands. Is it just me?"
3,hit or miss,"With HIM, its seems to be a hit or miss with their songs. I really dont get it to be honest. Yes, I'm a CKY fan and a Bam fan; no, not fanatic. I personally enjoy a few of the songs on CKY movies from HIM, but to be honest, the rest of the songs you don't hear aren't really that good.There are maybe 5 songs I like from them altogether, but the rest seem to just be the same trash. For those who are like 'incredible cd' or whatever, yeah thats your opinion, but you really need to listen to some older music, or just good music in general. This cd is BY FAR not incredible."
4,H.I.M. has themselves a new fan!,"I picked up ""Dark Light"" a couple of months ago and it really introduced me to this unique sound that they have. I picked up this album and like it just as much. I am going to get the remainder of their CDs as I really like the style and sound of their music!"
5,They're not about Bam,"Ok, I do agree that a lot of kids that want to be like Bam are starting to listen to this band, and that's cool. There's nothing wrong with that. Also, if you want to buy and album, but Razorblade Romance, not dark light. Dark light is an album in which adapted to the American style. Razorblade Romance is the best CD they've put out yet, in my opinion. If you guys aren't sure about these guys, go listen to ""Sigillium Diaboli"", great song!"
5,H.I.M. rocks,hello..well i must say that this is a masterpiece of the band H.I.M......they are considered many times as a goth band...but thats not right...they have they own original style..Love Metal..all the songs on the album are great..i cant say that it has some boring ones..the lyrics are so melancholic and kind..and the songs ..you can compare them with blues...the only difference its that they have some hard melodic guitars...this album worths..you gotta have it....all the him albums as great...but they are so different...so you should listen them all
3,HIM,I must admit this cd has great songs on it. However I've been listening to it for 5 weeks and it got repetitive. Since then 2 years have gone and Razorblade Romance has nothing but dust on itMaybe I should give it a try cos I remember enjoying it but there is some better music. Also the love topic that is on every song gets boring
5,Wow,Fusion bands usually aren't my thing. But I think it's because most bands just can't do it right. HIM does it right. It's basically hard rock with a twist of goth pop. Really sweet ballads and some very nice guitar work make this album totally solid all the way though. Gone with the Sin is my fave track but the whole album is just excellent. The cover is a bit cliche but musicians are like freaky or something...
1,I Hope You're Joking Me...,"Seriously, what is so great about this band? Whoever calls this metal is completely braindead. THIS IS F*CKING POP MUSIC! Yet more trendy Hot Topic goth/pop music that is taking over, and those ""heartagram"" symbols are way too trendy these days.I know this is pop music. I decided to download a song off of this album (""Join Me In Death"") and I was extremely disappointed. It starts off with piano playing and the lyrics, ""Baby, join me in death"". I swore to God that this was N*Sync rgone gothic. And how did they get on the Headbangers Ball compilation with METAL bands (some are hard rock)? If you like pop music, feel free to buy this. If you like metal, avoid at all costs."
1,just another cheesy glam band,"I heard about this band a lot, yet I never heard anything from them since last night. Let me just clarify a few things...this is no were near being ""metal"" or is this ""gothic"". This is a glam band that has taken thier love for The Cure, and Black sabbath to far, and turn it into crap. It seems as though mtv has done it again with another cheesy gothic band that is full of hot-topic trends. When I think about this band I think of AFI, Evanescence, Marilyn manson, Slipknot, and Linkin park, just a few of the trendy cheesy poser mainstream bands. Brain Hugh Warner (yes, this is the actual name of manson) has gotten other bands to try to fallow him in his foot-steps. He is the vanity filled, trendy, mainstream mtv ""goth"" [my face will be the by-product of my music] world. I like metal, and this is NOT metal. This is more punk if anything. This is pansy ""my family hates me"" ""my boyfriend/girl-friend just broke up with me, and I want to kill myself"" tenny-bopper music."
5,you don't have to be a goth/rock/metal fan to LOVE HIM,if the revolution in U.S. music finally going to happen - HIM is going to do it! (or HER as they're known in the U.S.). the wonderfully talented boys just released their first u.s. record! let's keep our fingers crossed.
1,this cd and band is awful,"dear god, what the hell is this garbage. anyone that thinks this band is good is insane. ""most depressing love songs"" was in one of these reviews...if you want depressing love songs, dont look for them in His Infernal Magesty's(HIM) cd. go buy some emo if you want sad love songs. this band, and Camp Kill Yourself (CKY) both suck. i hope no one ever buys these cds ever again. i didnt even want to give 1 star, but i couldnt post this unless i did."
1,Finnish goth metal?,"are u on drugs? stop with the metal label. pop rock sounds a bit better to me. ""When razorblade romance was released in Finland, a young man threw himself off a cliff and they found this cd in his Discman."" yet one more reason NOT to listen to the amazingly boring, pop goth crap group known as HIM (hopeless idiotic morons).and bam IS the only reason they got anywhere. goth METAL my ass.p.s. thanks for clearing up the heartogram thing"
1,H.I.M. is B.A.D.,"This is Finland's Britney Spears right here, folks.You want some real suicide rock check out Sentenced, Charon, or Poisonblack, among others. I can't say I'm surprised this band has started gaining popularity in the states, far be it for MTV-brainwashed morons to listen to anything but... well, MTV-brainwashed-moron music. Ironic, isn't it. Just remember that any time you want a product plugged. Put it on MTV and have some stupid ""star"" say its ""da bomb"" and you'll sell a million units in 2.5 seconds."
1,blah,"this type of music sucks. simple as that. it goes no where, the lyrics are pathetic, the tallent in this band is less than nothing. wtf why are they famous......il tell you why because stupid lil pre teens/teens dont know true music and they like this bulls*%# because its all they know.....its what they are fed...its not their fault they have horrible music taste, its jsut a shame they are stuck listening to this garbage."
1,Not very good at all,"Being in Guitar World and Metal Hammer does not make a band good. This is far from being what real metal is about. This band is far from bein a good finnish band. Bands such as Flowing Tears, Lullacry, Nightwish are real finnish Metal bands.The best Goth Metal bands are Epica, Darkwell, After Forever. Him is far from being any where as good as them."
4,beautiful and addictive,"this album has taken root in my soul like some sort of twisted, thorny rose. it's the perfect album for angsty moments, for rainy days, for long car rides, for dancing...possibly for anything.i've only had it for a few days, so the last few songs start to blend, but the first three especially, ""your sweet six six six"", ""poison girl"" and ""join me in death"", made the album an instant favorite.it's a little bit metal, a little bit ballad, a little bit classic rock and a whole lot of tragic romance. how can you resist its call?"
4,Pretty Good,"I love this group because of the dark gothy atmospere and the heartsick lyrics of Ville Vallo. This reminds me of decadent rock with a lead singer that is reminscent of Bowie, Jagger, Smith and others who had a swagger and embraced the lifestyle. But a few tracks were lackluster."
1,I can't believe you did this,"You sent me a cd with one song on it. I paid for this cd and I got one song. I cannot believe that you did this, from now on I am buying things NEW because obviously I cannot trust some people here."
2,2 stars only because it can remove face oil...but it will strip you.,"It is very drying and I do not recommend it at all for someone with sensitive/oily skin. You will find yourself reaching for the moisturizer more than one should, however if you want to use it for your body then its not a bad product. Oh yeah before I forget there is a smell to it, not bad, but herbal."
4,She Loves it!!,"I bought this for my daughter who is almost two. So far she's only played with it in the bath tub, but I plan to bring it to the pool as well. She and her sister who is almost 5 love it! Lots of little gadgets to play with, keeps them busy in the tub. I especially like the little net... great for coordination! Putting away their toys is so much more fun with they get to store it in a big green frog!"
3,nice but cheaply packaged,"I bought this as a gift for my neice's birthday. She loves the toys and plays with them every night. I, on the other hand, was a little disappointed. The items were shipped in a large box with no individual packaging. The toys arrived nicked and banged up. I really wanted to return the items but decided to give them to her anyway. Of course being just a year old she has never known the difference but my suggestion is to find these in a store somewhere if you want them to look new."
1,Aloe Vera 80 facial wash has dangerous ingredients,"I have been using Aloe Vera 80 facial wash for over 5 yearsand recently when receiving from Vitamin website, theproduct's ingredients definitely have been changed.It smells like lye and stings my eyes horribly evenwhen washing with my eyes closed. I know that theingredients have changed but the Lily of the Desertfolks disagree..Be VERY careful with this product....much harsher solution"
3,"Beautiful prose, horrible characters","I really enjoy reading this author's prose. She writes in a very clear, strong fashion and expresses herself well. The problem with this book is that the characters are not people you would want to spend any time with. I started to truly hate Rosalie as the book wore on, and at the end I thought the guy that she ended up with was too good for her. He was the only character that I really liked at all, maybe Delbanco should have made him the lead. I love her writing, but I really hated the characters."
2,Pretty blah,"What I found myself thinking as I read ""Ask Me Anything"" was, ""Hasn't someone told Miss Delbanco to show, not tell?"" A promising storyline is constantly interrupted by Rosalie's narration. Nothing is left for the reader to infer on his/her own, and the generalizations punctuating the text are neither insightful nor amusing enough to warrent the interruption. The ""I'm just telling you what happened"" narration doesn't work because Rosalie's boring voice adds nothing to compensate for the clutter of casual prose.I'm not quite sure what the point of the girls' letters were. As chapter frames go they were pretty obvious, and didn't fit with the plot.As a character, Rosalie is neither complex enough to make the novel serious or funny enough to make it, well, funny. She describes herself as average, and does nothing to show us otherwise.In Delbanco's favour is that her writing is controlled, her plot basically interesting, and that she has plenty of time to improve."
1,Piece of Junk! Waste of Money!,"Great Concept - Horrible Execution. There's a reason this item is in the bargain bin. It sounds really neat but in reality it's a huge disappointment. As soon as I pulled it out of the box I knew the thing would be destroyed within days and I was right. You have to hang the ruler underneath the little recording device and it's just a couple of hole punches with absolutely no reinforcement. That was ripped down nearly immediately. I've since bought reinforcment circles from an office store but am thinking that I should just move on.The other bad design is the recording device. As you're trying to learn how to work the recorder, it's very easy to ""accidently"" record but there is no simple way (or at least not that I could find) to erase what you recorded. Considering the thing is designed for children they really need to work on making it child friendly. Stick with pencil hash marks in a doorway and stick the money you would have spent in a college fund."
2,Same old info,"Yawn....any woman who's read any number of basic diets will be bored with this book. It's basically an accumulation of any other diet you've surely read about.Some samples of the many ""tips"" offered by the interviewed skinny chicks, the tips the book soley revolves around: Do cardio!, count calories! avoid sugar! protein is filling! avoid processed foods! Practice positive self-talk! Wow, nothing new covered here. And these tips are presented as if the author was the first to discover this ground-breaking advice.I would think anyone could easily be a ""skinny chick"" like those highlighted in this book, if they were doing between 2-3 hour daily work-outs like they are! And note that all info given from the skinny chicks are about maintaining their skinny-ness, not obtaining it in the first place."
4,Honest and Motivating,I love that there is a book telling you honestly how much hard work and dedication it takes to stay healthy and fit. These women have truly made this their lifestyle and I found it incredibly motivating.
4,Good Book,"Book was insiteful on ""what skinny chicks do"" to keep healthy.Recommend for anyone looking for a lifestyle change, and needing some hints on how to do it."
1,The Secret of Skinny Chicks,"I found this book deeply disappointing - especially the 'Meet the Skinny Chicks Part'. I am a full time working mother and if I make it to the gym three times a week for 45' a go I consider myself lucky. Most of the profiles are based on actresses, models or super-models who have the time and the ability to spend seven days a week and two to three hours per day exercising. I do not have that privilege and I know many, many others who feel the same. The majority of the examples cited are not 'real people' and, therefore, should not have made it in a book addressed to the general public."
5,Wrong Comic,"I purchased, and didn't realize that it was a new cover on a very old school comic. Will have to pay closer attention next time. Just not what i expected... Still an oldy but goody"
5,Great Pictorials,All of Vickers books are well written with excellent pictorials . SOme parts could have used a bit more in depth explanation but it is a field manual so that is why some items are not as explained in depth
4,The Ideal Vicar,"What a wonderful discovery this book was! Once again I initially judged the book choice on its cover and my interest in the period in which it was written. And it was a great choice. The Vicar's upbeat character was consistent throughout the book. Even in the worst of times, being at his worst, he brought himself back to his basically good, decent nature. This book is perfect for lovers of classics, who have not yet discovered Oliver Goldsmith and especially those who enjoy and laugh at the character of the vicar in other great classics!"
4,An intelligent book,"I liked this book, but did not get all five stars because of the slowness and somewhat predictable ending. But it was good writing, despite being a little bit stereotypical, but here i am chastizing a book which i gave four stars."
1,Not something I&#65533;d recommend.,"As I was reading this book I found that all I was hearing had to do with how brilliant the men were and how simple the women were. Mr. Wakefield (the father) made several references to how well he ""trained"" his wife. In another instance, the women were only chatting but the men were arguing philosophy. I also found this book to be a tedious read. I wouldn't waste my time on it."
1,These shoes are partially leather!!!!,"The shoes themselves are comfortable and good looking for casual wear, however they are not as advertised on amazon. I am a vegetarian and was on a hunt for a reasonably priced pair of good looking casual shoes that are made of synthetic materials only and I came upon these Deertags by typing vegetarian shoes into the search engine. They say manmade in description, but low in behold I order them and look at the stiched tag on the inside and yes their upper is partially made of leather. What a waste of time for anyone looking not to where animal skin on their feet!!! Otherwise buy them."
1,THIS SHOE IS NOT VEGAN,"After reading contradictory reviews on the materials used for this shoe, I contacted Deer Stag directly to inquire whether or not it is made of genuine leather. E. Philips is correct, this shoe, and all of the Deer Stag line is made of genuine leather. However, the Soft Stag line has a similar looking shoe called the Tremor that is made of synthetic materials. I will gladly remove my 1 star review once the description on this shoe has been changed (which will hopefully be soon since I contacted amazon customer service)."
3,A contributor,This is a great book. My favorite poetry books are ones from this series. I love to hear how my generation expresses themselves. Keeep up the good work Marlow!
4,A truely diverse collection of poetry.,"I agree with poetry purists that this book does not represent well crafted poetry; however, one should keep the objective of the book in mind. I do believe this book accomplishes what it aims to do by showing the diversity of a generation. Some of the poetry in this book is well crafted. Other poems in this book are not necessarily well crafted, but at least seem to be true expressions from the poets. I hope there will be a book two with perhaps a few improvements. I would like to see more acclaimed poets and page numbers."
5,"An interesting, fresh insight into poetry","While this book may not represent what poetry purists would consider the best American poetry, the book does reflect a kaleidscope of poetic voices and a range of abilties. Some of the poetry is very well crafted, while other poems are somewhat rough. Still, it is refreshing to have something different out there. Also, all of the poets show potential. Providing young writers with a forum will hopefully encourage them to futher develope their writing prowess.The book also gives insight into an often put down and misunderstood generation. For the most part, I think the book acheives its mission."
3,A not-too-flattering introduction to a generation,"Mr. Weaver has done the X generation only a slight disservice. You'll find this group of poems, as the editor says in his introduction, full of feeling and emotion. And he is all too correct; roughly 85% of these poems are written in first-person singular, and, although such self-centeredness may be necessary in a volume intended to be definitive of a generation, here it shows that generation prone to confessional navel gazing, as well as the use of poor grammar and punctuation. Many readers will find the varying fonts distracting, but not nearly so as the absence of page numbers. Still, the anthology shows flashes of brilliance, and, with its fine yet unself-conscious accessibility, gazes defiantly at today's vapid status quo of academic poetry."
4,great cd single,"Most of you probably know this track from Groove the movie. It's an awesome cut and is well recieved. It's a more progressive trance track, with some interesting variation."
5,Much better than any third-party stylus,"I bought this pack because the stylus that came with my Clie N710C was one of those that had the light in the tip, and the darned thing broke. The OEM stylus (original from Sony) is the only way to go, since they don't break under normal usage, fit perfectly into the stylus hole (the other one didn't do that either), and look good too."
3,A bit light but acceptable,I prefer a much heavier stylus - so I find the Sony version a bit disappointing. But the price is reasonable and the quality of the unit seems in order. Overall an average effort.
3,Beware,"There are apparentely two different versions of this release which I found out the hard way. I purchased this expecting what was to be a projecion of what a 4th Stooges album would be like and instead I received a product much different than the tracklisting provided indicates.There's a version on Bomp Records and a version on Revenge which is what I received.The tracklisting of what I received is:01. Death Trip02. Head On03. Rubber Legs04. Radio Advertisement05. Raw Power06. I Am A Man07. Ballad Of Hollis Brown08. Open Up And Bleed09. Johanna10. Purple Haze11. I'm So GladThis is a live album of sorts and while it's actually pretty decent, it's hardly what I ordered or was lead to believe I was ordering.Just a heads up."
3,Not quite what I had in mind.,"If you were a fan of the first Cinematic Orchesra album""Every Day"", ""Motion"" might not be what you had in mind. The first album was much less jazzy and much more symphonic, or dramatic.I like both the albums, but I loved ""Every Day"". If your intentions to buy ""Motion"" are based on your reaction to ""Every Day"", you might want to reconsider and instead purchase the ""Remixes"" album, which is full of good tracks."
1,Others in this series are better ........,"There are much better chill cds than this. To me chill is about flow, and there is no flow here."
5,The other side of midnight,I was held captive from the first chapter til the end. The story has so many twists and turns that you are constantly on the edge of your seat trying to hurry and get to the next page. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an interesting read.
4,Sublime Cooking Ahead,"We have been looking for a Dutch Oven this size for about 5 months. We really liked the Bayou Classic because the lid is actually functional. The reason we have not purchased before is the shipping was almost as much as the oven. Super Saver Shipping saved the day. Oven is of good quality, not quite like they used to make them in Grandma's day. We have been pleased so far."
4,Bayou Classic 16 qt a great buy,"This item was very reasonably priced, delivered on time and intact (apparently others have had delivery issues) and performed as expected. Having said that, let me add it isn't designed to be pretty, it's for cooking. The fit, form and function are exactly what is needed for producing great flavored bulk cooking. This isn't one of those beautiful Le Creuset pots, and isn't supposed to be. It's one quarter (or less) the price, and is designed to be buried in embers, without damage to the finish.I gave it a 4 star rating because I had to ""season"" it prior to use. If seasoned from the factory, it would definitely rate 5 stars.DO NOT TRY TO USE IT WITHOUT DOING MULTIPLE SEASONINGS! It will rust quite easily.This 16 quart pot will make enough Osso Bucco for a platoon!"
4,Guerrero Wreck exposed,"Good short documentary that exposed a ""small""event in our history that really relates to the ""big"" issue of slavery. Slavery is still very emotional to us just a few generations hence and you can see it in many of the personalities in this film. I guess that is why we do not see enough history re. slavery in the Wester Hemosphere. The far ranging mix of personalities and characters here help tell a very interesting story. I wish more ""Projects"" such as this have the same attention as there are thousands of events and stories to be told."
4,Works great with proper tool,"These connectors work great for making high quality coax patch cables. Note that these are ""compression"" connectors, not ""crimp"" connectors. Use the right tool and these work much better than crimp on connectors.Paladin Tools 70052 Compression Crimper"
4,NYC's best,"with King Django producing and assisting in the horn section, this album is one of the ripest to come from the stubborn records collection. I've also got thier vinyl EP, but I'm waiting for the turtable. I lament that these guys haven't stayed together as ska pop has died down, but ""the Early Years"" should stand the test of time if we can keep the thing in circulation.All together, this is a jazzy and loose album, bringing in memories of the Miles Davis quartet and the Skatalites. I'd go so far to say that this is what ""No Doubt"" could have been if they tried hard enough and avoided being too commercial. It's worth the buy. I'd like to see what these guys are up to these days. I only wish there was a little more tightness in the lyrics."
1,This game should have a DNB sticker=Do Not Buy!!,"This game is bad. The AI on it is terrible. The Japs take at least 3 seconds to shoot at you. The weapon selection is ok, but the selection isnt realstic. Annoying background music, stupid team mates, and levels are very much the same. These developers also make Vietnam Black Ops and World War II Normandy.Normandy is better than this if you want the best one, both..are bad.."
1,Not suitable for young kids.,I thought that this video would be calmer than some of the other Spiderman cartoons that I have purchased in the past. It is still pretty violent and I had to take it away from my 4 year old. I am surprised how hard it is to find a Spiderman cartoon for young kids.
3,Milking consumers,"Ok, I will admit that the Spider-man Animated Series was one of the best modern kids' cartoon shows. I was certainly a fan. However, the way they are releasing the DVDs is really crappy. Spider-Man's seasons averaged about 13 episodes. Normally, a thirteen-episode season on DVD would be about 20 bucks. Instead we are getting four episodes for our twenty bucks. Also, the best part of Spider-Man was the ongoing storylines. Here the episodes are taken out of the full context. In short, you can buy this if you really like the Spider-Man show. But otherwise keep your money, because you're kinda being ripped off."
5,Terrific material,"We used to listen to the comedy bits on a weekly radio program that plays in the D.C. area, and the whole family loves them. The Shakespeare retellings are the best -- funny, yet actually quite close to the actual plots. And What it was was football is a perfect deadpan southern dimwit parody. I'm so glad these are out on cd."
4,Pre-Vintage Andy,"Here's Andy before Mayberry -- some of the original singles that gave him a shot on the Danny Thomas Show as the laid-back NC Sheriff. What is was was Football will make you giggle, laugh, spill yer Big Orange, and I don't know what-all. But especially watch out for Andy's read on Carmine!"
4,my hometown,Andy is from Mt Airy NC which is my home town. I dad spent time with Andy doing his childhood. So I may be a bit prejudiced but I love this guy and his comedy! Try a couple and see what you think. It's clean family oriented comedy.
4,Funny,Funny and I had not heard of many of the skits. Shows Andy's human side a lot and is refreshing.
1,"What it was was football, is there a part 3?","Is there a part 3 to what it was was football? I ordered this CD expecting the entire track. It said part 1 & 2, but I've heard this track before and not everything was on this CD. Can someone help??"
1,andy griffith american originals,"My question if the same as Mr. Bernard's. What is on this cd/audio tape. If I knew, I might also want to purchase it."
1,Poorly made,"I wanted an inexpensive ""beater"" to leave in the car, etc instead of worrying about my real mandolin. But I was terribly disappointed with this one. It looked pretty good out of the box for this purpose. But then several strings started breaking. Ok, cheap strings, easily replaced. But now some of the hardware started coming out, the screws on the tuning brackets, and I could see that the bridge had sharp edges that was causing the broken strings. As I started to look this instrument over carefully I just decided to not take a further chance on it before the return time ran out. So I returned it, which pained me because I have to pay for return shipping. But I will say that Amazon/Austin were good about it and made no hassles and I did get credit back promptly."
1,i have this in blue,"I have had mine for a year and a half and it is alright if you are just starting out and need to know if you like playing mandolin before you shell out big bucks for a professional one. not worth your time or money if you are looking for a high quality mandolin.I didn't buy it from amazon but from a different site. Once I opened the box it was deemed unreturnable, even though there were manufacturer problems with it. The fourth fret had to be filed down under the e string for it to even play right.My advice, NEVER buy an instrument online if you can buy one in person and test it out first."
2,Okay as a first instrument,"I bought one of these on ebay for $5 with a $35 shipping fee as well. Amazon claims it is originally 160.00 and is a 80% price deduction but this remains to be seen. I bought this as my first instrument which is fine because I knew nothing about playing music or the sound it should produce. It is very flat, and no matter what, you can't get it to tune. I have tried 2 sets of strings and it sounds okay with a good set od daddario's. I would however reccomend the 39.99 or 49.99 mandolins on amazon. They sound like real mandolins and are generally well built for the price and for 10$ more its a huge advancement."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"This Belkin cable works ok. I also have Monster cable and have compared the two. The Monster cable by far out-performs the Belkin. The connectors on this Belkin are bulky and long and do not fit as well in the HDMI port as the Monster cable. The smaller connectors on the Monster are easier to connect. You can see at a glance the superior quality of the Monster construction when you compare the two side by side. Better construction ultimately means better picture and sound quality. Yes, this cable works for HDMI and one can get by with it fine. However,the picture, sound, and quality of the Monster are much better. You definitely get what you pay for."
1,Non-functional HDMI cable,"Dead on arrival. Ordered a Samsung 46"" LCD, and got this cable to hook up from the cable box to the new TV. Cable did not work at all. Tried another, more expensive one which worked perfectly. Lesson learned."
2,"This is not bad, but there are better ones",AZCables HDMI 1.3 2.0M (6.5ft) Certified High Performance Flat 24 AWG Cableis much much better quality.
5,Quality product at the right price,"I saw this product in a local store for twice the price. I purchased twoand am using one to connect my HD tv to the satellite box and the other toconnect a home theatre system. The picture is flawless. My neighbor usesMonster cables and we tried them on my set and you could not see any diff-erence. These come in the original factory packaging and are well protectedin the container shipped to your home. Excellent, quick service."
2,good at first...now doesnt work,Belkin usually makes good products. The price was right on this cable so I picked it up for my ps3. Worked good for about 9 months now and all of the sudden it just stopped transmitting signal. Checked other cables on the tv and it turned out to be the Belkin. Hopefully Amazon will send me a new one.
5,HDMI Cable,Great product. Works flawlessly and is a lot cheaper than Monster Cables or others of that ilk.
5,all you need...,This cable is all you need for an hdmi cable. The expensive ones are not necessary. Picture quality and sound are awesome. Fast delivery service.
4,Works Great!,This HDMI works great between my Sony PS3 and Samsung HDTV. Very high quality cable at a great price. You won't be disappointed.
5,Great,"No complaints here, the cord works just fine. Not a huge nerd when it comes to these things but it looks good and sounds good, so I say buy it and you should be happy with it!"
5,Solid construction,My experience with HDMI cables is that they either work or don't -- no inbetween. The problem with the cheapest cables is that some break very easily. This is a well-priced and solidly constructed cable. There's no reason to pay more for an HDMI cable (despite what some salespeople tell you when trying to push a $100 HDMI cable).
4,Almost Perfect,Everything about this cable was perfect. Easy set up...CHEAP!! Only 0.01!!! The only problem was that 6 feet was a little too short for my set up...but thats subjective...Great products for an unbeatable price!
5,"Affordable, Works Like a Champ.","What else do you need to know? I have used Belkin products for years (particularly their cables) and have never had to return one or trash one (Firewire, USB, HDMI, whatever...). They use high grade materials but give you a low-to-medium grade price point. I even went to Radio Shack thinking ""this will be the practical option"", and their cables of the same length cost twice as much! And I don't mean their Monster cables, I mean their ""Shack Brand"" that traditionally stereo lovers and others have turned to, in order to get a good deal.Just get this cable and start enjoying your HD content. No need to review any further IMO. ;-)"
4,works great,the hdmi works great. and it was soooooo much cheaper than the cables stores like best buy and circuit city try to sell you.
5,Great value!,"This is the second Belkin HDMI cable that I bought from Amazon. The first one I used for my Samsung DVD Receiver to my Samsung 46"" HDTV and works great. I bought the second one to connect my wife's HP laptop to my HDTV so we can watch videos and stuff. It works really well and it's cheap. No sense in buying overpriced HDMI cables!"
4,Solid Cable,"It is a satisfactory cable. Maybe it was the LCD or the Blue ray but I dont get blown away. The price is great compared to the big stores though. This HDMI will get you results, but not knock you off your feet."
5,Great value HDMI,"I have three of these cables. Knowing what a ripoff Monster, et al are I bought the least expensive HDMI I could find at Target. (These were the days before I discovered Monoprice.) I had one running from my PS3 and one from my HD cable box. Then, when I bought a receiver for home theater sound, I added a third. I have had no issues with this cable at all. It was a great value, even when I paid $40 for it at a brick and mortar store. It's an even better deal at $12."
3,BELKIN AM22302-06 6-FOOT HDMI TO HDMI CABLE,"This Belkin HDMI cable works as described. I use it to hook up a laptop to an Acer DLP projector.The laptop and projector sit on a table, so the 6-foot cable is more than long enough for this purpose. The length is suitable for when using the projector with a tripod."
4,this is a good movie,i've seen this movie the day it opened and i thought it was alright but not that good. after the dvd came out and i thought well let's give it try and i bought it. after i've watched the dvd i really started to like the movie. to everyone who didn't see it. give it a try. it's definetly worth the few bucks.
3,"Great special effects, weak plot.","Hollow man is definitely eye candy, but it changes from suspenseful at the beginning to a slasher-type film at the end. It's good for horror movie fans, but matrix fans may only appreciate the dazzling special effects it has to offer. It's an OK DVD, I guess."
3,A Predictable Special Effects Movie,"I thought that Elizabeth Shue was very good in this movie. And K. Bacon was all right. But the plot is compeltely derivative. This is just another attempt to ""modernize"" H.G. Wells' classic book from more than a hundred year ago. Well, does the attempt succeed? I think the movie is so predictable as to make the story line dull, therefore everything relies on special effects. These certainly are superb, but they cannot save the whole project from its simplicity and less than compelling characters. All along I was conscious of the fact that I was watching actors, who trade silly barbs, and not real scientists, and that the movie would have the prosaic and by now banal end that any intelligent viewer can expect."
1,PEOPLE WILL PUT THIS DOWN IT LACKS QUALITY!!!,"I COULDN'T SEE MYSELF GIVING H.MAN EVEN 1 STAR THEY ASKED ME 2 RATE IT...(IT'S MEDIOCRE)2 SAY THE VERY LEAST!! KEVIN BACON IS CAPABLE OF SO MUCH BETTER UM...PERHAPS LIKE FOOTLOOSE & THAT WAS SOME OF HIS' EARLIER WORK! Elizabeth SHUE SHOULD'VE DIED ALONG WITH HER OTHER BOYFRIEND! THE SPECIAL EEFECTS WERE GREAT BUT WASTED ON THIS HORRID FILM! I CAN HONESTLY SAY THE ONLY PART I ENJOYED WAS THE SCENE OF THE GORILLAS' BLOOD STREAM & THAT'S SAD! I GAVE MY COPY 2 A FAMILY MEMBER BECAUSE ""I WAS FURIOUS 2 REMEMBER THAT ""I ACTUALLY SPENT MONEY ON THAT FILTH""! (I WANT MY DOE BACK)!***SOME CAN'T OVERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE PUTTING H.MAN DOWN, WHEN I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANYONE OTHER THAN THE STAFF WOULD SUPPORT IT!!**"
2,Disappointing Misuse Of The Subject Of Invisibility,"Hollow Man proposes an interesting subject: Invisibility. A subject which opens doors to a lot of possibilities, ethical ones, humouristic ones, etc. The makers of this film do not succeed in digging into any of those. In fact, I doubt they're even trying. Instead, they drown the subject in a film which is basicly about special effects, voyeurism, a ridiculous jealousy story, and unnecessary, unexplained evil and violence.Furthermore, Hollow Man is so packed with obvious movie mistakes that you don't even have to look for them; you will be annoyed anyway.A poor performace. What a shame, 'cause it starts out interesting... and ends up just being ridiculous and a useless waste of time."
2,Thin and shallow,"Although the special effects are very impressive, thats all there really is to this film. The plot is wafer thin, the characters generally uninteresting and the whole thing is very predictable. If you watch it with this in mind, you may enjoy it, if it is your kind of film, but really for the rest, unless attractive special effects make a good film in your view, don't bother. Very dissapointing"
1,"Can't give a zero star, huh? Too bad!!!","This has to be one of the worst films of the last year! What starts out really good, with the invisible gorilla and then Kevin Bacon turning invisible WOW - Special Effects 5 stars!!! All of the actors and actresses in the movie 0 stars!!!!! Yes, this movie is so unbelievably stupid. Instead of Kevin Bacon running around robbing banks or messing with the government or FBI or whatever he stays locked up in his basement laboratory. He does go out and what does he do? Rapes a neighbor and kills people. Yes , that's it! I know you don't believe it, but that is it! Elizabeth shue walks around like some super scientist and her lover annother scientist are absolutely horrible in the movie. Talk about BAD acting! The ending is a total rip-off of the terminator - You think he's dead, but just keeps coming back! This is as bad as it gets. This movie and Battlefield Earth are tied for the worst movie of last year!"
1,Awful!,"Then again any thing with Kevin Bacon usually means it sucks. This wasn't scary, suspenseful, and doesn't deliver on any level. Acting stinx, plot is hackneyed and boring, this makes Halloween Ressurection look like cinematic art. This has no room on this planet. So much time you could spend doing other things than watching an atrocious film like this. See something else."
2,NOT WORTH THE CELLULOID,"Where do I begin to explain what is wrong with this film? The only decent part is Josh Brolin. Kevin Bacon has never done much for me, and he is positively diabolical and egotistical in this role. He does spend most of the time in this film as an invisible man, which is good, but overall the concept of making a man invisible and his going crazy while invisible is not very interesting. Elisabeth Shue has become a progressively worse actress since her Oscar nominated performance in Leaving Las Vegas. It is as though she thinks if she acts powerful and overly sexual she will be a better actress, but it all seems forced and very contrived."
4,HOLLOW SCRIPT (WHAT A WASTE OF SOME EXCELLENT FX),"The buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Sadly, they stopped there. They should have continued to make the script disappear, then the silly set, and finally every visible element of this film. Because, there's nothing else there to show.And this from a man who's behind all-time rockers like Total Recall and Basic Instinct (Verhoeven)! Here, he seems completely oblivious of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world (and this has some outstanding ones) cannot hide a a script from ""Scripts-R-Us"". Even the predictable slasher gore and the breasts on display (ah, the corrupt power invisibility can bring!) couldn't salvage the movie's tedium.Possibly OK rental, nothing more."
2,"Excellent Special Effects, but a disgusting Script.","I saw this movie not knowing what sort of flick it would be. I think that it was the most pathetic movie of the 90s. For one, brilliant scientists and doctors don't act like that. For two the whole plot is trivial and weak. It is entertaining however and the special effects are great, but it's the only thing which keeps the viewer going. I do happen to have a favorite scene and that's when a bland character named Matt is trapped playing Marco and Polo with the demented Sebastain Caine."
2,Fun Special Effects And That's About It.,"Hollow Man is no different than those other invisible man movies where the scientist goes mad, the only thing that makes this one different is the great effects.... Instead from Paul Verhoeven we get an invisible man that's ...[aroused]... As a man I can't say I didn't enjoy those scenes ""lol"" but you would think a movie with such great effects and a good cast would have a better script.Elisabeth Shue is beautiful, there's no doubt about it, ...she's hard to take serious as a scientist. Kevin Bacon makes a taunting and chilling invisible man but just like Shue he's not really believable as the brainy type. In fact it's only Josh Brolin and Kim Dickens that are the only ones who look like they belong there. ...Hollow Man is a gory B-Movie with fun special effects and although I have mixed feelings for it, I recommend it because it's still mildly entertaining. Still it could have been much, much more though."
4,Great movie!,"Paul Vehoven's films (Robocop,Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Starship Troopers) have always aptly blended an impressive mix of sexual overtones and ultra-violence, and Hollw Man is one of his best films, with great SFX, excellent action and trademark Verhoven nudity. Unlike his films in the 80s and early 90s, Hollow Man is much more stylish and inventive.Kevin Bacon is great as the crazy genius who manages to turn himself invisible, and the naughty things he gets up to are fun. Elizabeth Shue is the only real let-down in this film (running around in a very tight shirt) but she dosn't do any real damage. Sure it's cheesy and silly, and the film's graphic elements may not sit well with some viewers but what did you expect? Great fun in a cheesy B-movie kind of way."
3,"Nothing horrible, but it's still wasted potential.","Kevin Bacon is the scientist who turns himself invisible and slowly grows insane. Initially intriguing thriller from Paul Verhoeven begins very well, with some of the best special effects I've ever seen, but eventually comes loose when the movie turns into a disturbing and unbelievable slasher. It's all still watchable, if only for the premise and effects. Bacon is terrific (as usual) as the titular character.** 1/2 out of *****"
3,OK soso cheesy i think,Well all i got to say about this movie is so so i didnt like it as much as i thought I would the ending was very cool though.
2,Could have been so much better...,"The Hollow Man has a great premise but fails to do anything with it. Kevin Bacon is a research scientist for the government who has discovered how to make himself invisible. This movie could have focused a lot on what Bacon does when he is invisible. Instead he gets out for one night, but spends most of his time in the lab. Also, since Bacon is invisible most of the time, we just hear is voice. For all we know, that isn't even him when he is wearing a mask. The final fight in the lab is pretty exciting, but also pretty predictable. This movie would have been better if it had been set outside of the lab."
1,"Wow, couldn't believe it....bad, bad, good.","Bad acting. Bad story. Good special effects. In retrospect, the typical Hollywood garbage we get every summer. To know what the movie is about, read the other reviews."
3,Enjoyable fun,"But Paul Verhoeven's essentially a pretty boring director.Is it actually possible for the guy to make a film without any violence or sex/nudity? All the same ,this is entertaining stuff.The story has a pretty slow feel to it,but the special effects are great and it's certainly very lively towards the end."
2,Wow that was bad,"Despite amazing special effects this is one horible movie. The acting is completely ridiculous and the plot that started off alright, quickly became another one for the trash can."
1,This movie is a big disappointment!,The trailer made this movie out to be better than it really was. This movie is the only movie I can say is worse than Troll 2 at least Troll 2 didn't have the pretense of being an awesome movie. This movie had a theatrical release and an awesome trailer so there is no excuse for this movie to suck!Hollowman had awesome special effects and high caliber actors how come it's such a worthless piece of crap?Oh because the script much like the title is practically non-existent!
3,A journey without return,"This fascinating fiction entertainment deals about a curious experiment the overall search of the biogenetic sequence. Since a smart scientist has made certain experiments without concrete advances, the top authorities who command such project treat him with retire the financial budget in case not obtain more solid results.The main twist concerns when he decides by himself, to make the journey. But the rest runs for you. A delirious exploration of the human nature faced with nature forces. A breathtaking movie that made us remind that famous film of Ken Russell : ""Altered states"". Bloody story with the accustomed violence and overwhelming special effects.Perhaps the anecdote literally could not avoid a major and devastating reflection around the unthinkable facts that eventually might derivate from certain arrogant attitudes without taking into account the final goal.But the film is above the average."
4,Honestly is a great movie....,"Regardless of what some people are saying about this movie (""John Wayne""), Hollow Man is a great movie. Movies are made for entertainment, so don't psychoanalyze them, like some people seem to be doing. This movie is very entertaining, and has awesome special effects. Remember: It's only a movie!!!!"
2,Another movie ruined by the trailer,"The producers of Hollow Man made a mistake that many films of this nature do, they showed all the good parts in the trailer. The writers could have taken this to many levels but do not. Don't get me wrong I like the film because of the eye candy but the trailer ruined all the good parts."
1,One of the worst films I've ever seen,"I have a pretty high tolerance I think for bad movies. The writing and the acting in the movie was so bad, I couldn't finish it."
1,Waste of a rental fee,"This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have been known to enjoy some pretty bad movies. I wanted to turn it off, but for some reason, I just kept watching. Afterwards, I was so mad that I wasted my time and money on this piece of c***. I am seriously embarrassed for the people involved in making this movie. It just kept getting worse. There is a post below that mentions the ridiculous elevator scene. I just kept thinking ""How stupid do they think we are?"" I know it's tempting, but please, for your sake, resist the urge to buy or rent this."
1,"Good effect, but my god what a stupid movie",No logic involved what so ever. The end was about the most stupid thing I have ever seen on film (And that says a lot)
1,With a movie this BAD I must be brief.,"I wish I could give this movie zero stars. I saw this movie in the theater and I felt like asking for a refund just imagine buying this for your home. Kevin Bacon is horrible, the special effects are nothing to brag about and neither is this movie. I prefer the original which I haven't even seen."
3,Some good special effects....but,"There are so many holes in the story it's not funny. First I'd like to say the special effects where great. But make the story believable, the formula makes him invisible not superhuman!! If you'd wanted to make it believable that he was impervious to injury build that into the story line, just don't dump that on me at the end of the movie. Kevin Bacon was killed half a dozen times in the last ten minutes of the movie, but he kept coming back for more."
3,"Oscar-worthy special effects, but for the acting...","Kevin Bacon delivers a pretty predictable role as a ""do it, ask questions later"" scientist, once finding the serum to invisibility, immediately appoints himself guinea pig, and injects the serum, causing the Oscar-nominated special effects to really make the invisibility seem real. But, once he gets invisible, he uses his newfound invisibility to sexually molest three women (including Shue, costar, and his next-door neigbor) and on a killing rampage Michael-Myers style. Predictable eye candy, but fair acting keeps this from going down as another flop at sci-fi/thrillers. Also, female viewers may get a kick out of seeing Bacon's frontal nudity and backside. Rated R for graphic violence and gore, language, sexual content, and for graphic male and female nudity."
1,"The Movie is Hollow,Man!","Have you ever had the feeling that the movie's trailer was better than the movie?Well Hollow Man is one of them.The promos made it look like a cool sci-fi thiller,but instead it was B-grade horror/slasher trash dressed up with grade-A special effects.Don't get me wrong;I can suspend disbelief and enjoy mindless entertainment,but the bad acting and ludicrous scenarios(once the pet project's leader makes himself invisible,what does he do?He fondles and rapes woman.What class!)in this flick made this eye-candy buff sleepy.Had it been made with soild,well-written script and a different cast,it could have been killer.As it is,unfortunately,Hollow Man is last year's most disappointing movie."
2,Intriuging Premise Wasted,"Paul Verhoven could have made a much better movie out of this material. This time he seems to sabotage his own movie about half an hour in. Sure the SFX are good, but they serve the same old formula. That being said, Kevin Bacon turns in his usually good performance. In this film he's acting better than Verhoven is directing. ""Stir of Echoes"" is much more effective."
1,Hollow Movie,I was really dissapointed in this movie. It had an interesting plot - but the acting was terrible and Kevin Bacon seemed more obsessed with looking under skirts than anything. The ending was really bizzare where the ingenious Dr. goes nuts and starts to kill everyone just because he can't have his babe. I thought this movie might be appealing to my 13 year old son - but even he thought it was crap. Some of the special effects were interesting - but Bacon should be embarrased to have even done this movie.
1,Stupidest ending for a movie in 5 years,"GOOD: Great special effects! BAD: Everything else - especially because it seems that a 13 year old wrote the ending. Do audiences actually like seeing idiot people in movies that always think the bad guy is dead, but then he comes back for one more scare (or two, ...)? How many times in 1 movie can they use that same lame idea?"
4,I CAN'T LET IT GO,OK FIRST THINGS FIRST THIS MOVIE'S VISUALS ARE AMAZING WITH THAT SAID THE STORY IS JUST AS GOOD. ATLEAST RENT IT BUT PEOPLE WHY THE BAD REVIEWS THIS MOVIE HAS A VERY IMPRESSIVE STORY TO IT AND BESIDES IT HAS KEVIN BACON IN IT WHO IS ALSO VERY COOL HE HAS COLL SONGS WHEN HE DRIVES BE READY FOR THAT TO YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED WATCH IT YOU'LL LIKE IT!!
4,Hollow Man better on blu!,"This movie is one of those that require you to check your brain at the door, But it is still a good popcorn flick. It is kind of suspenseful and has killer visuals the story is only so-so."
2,Looks like someone had a brain fart...,"I took my friend Shannon to see this movie, and boy, was I disappointed. This movie had no plot, talent, or scares. I was absolutely disgusted at the violence towards the animals in this movie. And how many times can we re-use the whole ""Invisible Man"" plot? I guess I shouldn't have expected much, being that Paul Verhoeven brought us ""Showgirls."" The movie would have been a lot better if Kevin Bacon had caused some mischief to kind of lighten up the movie, instead of just raping and killing people. The only reason that I gave ""Hollow Man"" 2 stars instead of one, is because of the awesome special effects. It's sad that they had to be in such a flat, boring, superficial turd of a movie."
2,Disappointing,"As a huge Kevin Bacon fan, I was eagerly anticipating this movie. I was so disappointed at the waste of such great special effects. And yes, Kevin, keep your pants on! Don't get me wrong, I like a good horror movie. But the way the invisible guy set out to rape the neighbor, without any hesitation, was pretty sickening. I don't agree with the other review that stated this movie shows what a ""real"" person would be doing if they found themselves invisible. ""Normal"" men aren't just waiting for the opportunity to get away with raping a woman."
1,Pretty Weak,"I understand that people in horror movies are supposed to be stupid, but come on! These are Scientist. Not some stupid 18yo's in Scream. The other part of the film would be Kevin Bacon's character. If I could be invisible. I would permanently be out and about scaring people and purving out. Not wasting my time in a dungeon full of idiotic scientist."
2,Hollow Man - A Hollow movie,"I really expected more from this film. After watching this movie, you sit back and wonder why didn't they just add a plot to this whole movie? This movie could have been made with much more creativity. The special effects were good but not having any real plot made it disappointing to watch. They left too many parts open with no resolution. What happened to the neighbor? What happened after the guy was drowned in the pool? Didn't the commity get suspisous? What happened all the times that Kevin Bacon left the lab?RP"
2,Needs Improvement,This film was a major disappointment! I actually wanted the villian to win for once! I was convinced it was good due to the hype the advertisements made it out to be. But boy was I wrong!
4,Fleshed-out,"For the sake of art we can finally experience Hollow Man as intended, and it rocks: prepare for a kick not unlike seeing Hitchcock's PSYCHO with the shower scene cut back in!"
1,Horror Movie Junk,"Seems Hollywood has really ran out of good ideas for horror movies. They seemed to have found some really useful junk in ""Hollow Man"", my pick as worst movie of the year 2000. The story is quite nice, starting out, but as Bacon starts to fry up and burn, so does the movie. Really neat-o special-effects try their hardest to save this truck load of invisible crap, but never quite makes up for its tastes in nudity, violence, and stupidity. Give us Chevy Chase again! No, that was a joke."
3,Spectacular Effects...But What's With The Acting???,"I really think that the title of this review says it all. The effects in this film are berathtaking, but the performances turned in by the supporting cast are sub-par. Bacon and Shue do an okay job in their roles. Not my favorite Bacon movie, but not bad either. The supporting cast, however, either don't know how to act or they were handed really bad dialogue. Ignore that part of the movie. No worse than many ""classic"" horror films. This is still a fun film to watch."
2,Had potential,"At least the producers never pretended that this film was anything more than it was -- a showcase for stunning digital effects. The script is weak, the actors seem a bit lost, and the pacing is downright awful -- Bacon goes arrogant, driven scientist to homicidal maniac in one reel. And how many times do we have to watch the ensemble good guys get picked off, one by one, by the ""monster?"" I would like to have seen more of Bacon's temptations with power, wandering the streets of Washington and spreading mischief; this angle was handled much more adroitly by HG Wells over 100 years ago..."
2,Good special effects......,Nothing more. The story was a little dry and predictable...Kevin Bacon is one of my favorite actors. He should have pushed harder for a better story.....
4,good movie but terrible ending,"i liked the move but the ending was terrible. on a R rated thriller usaully there is one survivor but on this one there is two survivors. the lady and the jerk. the guy could have killed him and then the woman would have cried and then kill the invisible man. it ended terribally. but good action. cool special effects, great story, interesting but the ending is poor"
3,Not a Bad Movie,This isn't the greatest movie ever made but it isn't bad. The effects are awesome. The plot is a bit shallow and there are no surprises but the movie is entertaining just the same. I can think of worst ways to spend an hour and a half.
1,Evil Wins,"In real life good and evil are not completely black or white but colored in shades of grey. Kevin Bacon's character was a ""good guy"" but his scientific ego made him slightly grey along with the others on his staff. After their invisibility experiment worked on him, he went insane and was definitely in the black (evil) zone.Still, it was hard not to feel sorry for him given there were a couple of scientists more evil than he was. They were not only on scientific ego trips but decided to treat him as a lab rat.This movie was nauseating because the less evil scientists all die and the most evil scientists live. At least Bacon could claim insanity as a reason for his evilness."
1,LOUSY! HORRIBLE!,SOME OF THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE GREAT. THE CHARACTER IS SUPPOSED TO BE INVISIBLE. FOR SOME REASON THEY DECIDED TO SHOW THE GUYS PACKAGE CONTINUOSLY DURING THE MOVIE. GIVE ME A BREAK. I DID NOT WATCH THIS TO SEE AN OUTLINE OF KEVIN BACON'S PRIVATE PARTS.
2,Kevin Bacon is no Claude Rains.,"The one and only reason I gave this movie two stars is because it has great special effects, although Universal Pictures' The Invisible Man, staring Claude Rains, from 1933 invented the type of effects used in this film.From start to finnish, Hollow Man plays as nothing more...nothing less then an Invisible Man rip-off.If you want to watch a film about a mad scientist who turns himself invisible, skip this bad rip-off, and watch The Invisible Man (1933)."
2,Hollow Man Was A Hollow Movie!!,"This was one of the worst pictures I've ever seen. The trailers make it look appealing, but it really is just a stupid-plotted movie. Kevin Bacon harasses women the entire movie and at the end, the movie turns into a bloody gore fest. Just horrible!!"
1,Ain't only the man that is hollow!,"Where have we gone wrong in American films? Used to be that people went to the movies to be entertained, uplifted, view heroic exploits, relax and come home refreshed. We seem to be beseiged by a flood of gratituous gore, insanity and violence. This movie has many excellent special effects, but is certainly not something to see with your children (of any age). It is not only the man that is hollow, but the whole bloody thing.If 4th or 5th graders were asked what they would do if they were invisible, and you might, if they were honest, get answers like 'peeking into the girls' bathroom'. From there, the movie rapidly degenerates into a virtual blood bath with the hero/villain having nearly super-human strength and powers.This is easily one of the worst, most disturbing movies I have seen in several years. It was a true waste of time for me and the family. It truly was a hollow movie with very little redeeming value in sight."
1,The worst movie ever...?,"...well, it has some competition. Right up there wih ""Bats"", ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"", ""Home Alone 4"", ""Baby Geniuses"", and the like. I only recommend you buy it if you are a fan of animal cruelty or Kevin Bacon's ass. Otherwise, stay away."
3,"Now You See It, Now You Don't","""Hollow Man"" is another in director Paul Verhoeven's loud, gaudy multiplex spectacles, this one reprising the story of the invisible man. Genius scientist Kevin Bacon takes the serum this time out, and the expected madness, mania and mayhem ensue. Ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Shue, conveniently having an affair with Bacon's co-worker Josh Brolin, is in for a few nasty surprises, as are all his fellow scientists and even the girl across the courtyard, in a sequence cribbed from Hitchcock's ""Rear Window."" No, this is not rocket science or even very detailed script-writing, but as high tech Saturday matinee fodder, it is screamingly good fun. The special effects are awesome, and the final series of events, decried by many critics, was, for me, thrilling and well worth the price of admission to this theme park ride."
2,You'd have to be hollow in the head.,"All in all, Hollow Man is a decent thriller with good effects. Many people get coerced into giving this movie a good review from all the effects but you can't watch two straight hours just of computer effects. After it finishes with the disappearing it all goes downhill, often predictable and flawed. How many people would go crazy from being invisible? And as always, he has to kill everybody then escape. The fire system sprays water and you see him, more effects. I really like the part where the water's all over from the sprinklers and Kevin Bacon hits the electrical box with a crow bar and gets electrocuted but Elisabeth Shue, who happens to be several feet away from him, still manages to not get electrocuted."
3,"Invisibility done better, but still fun","HALLOW MAN is yet another flick in the ""Invisible Man"" genre, with Kevin Bacon playing the researcher who discovers the secret to invisibility, and goes mad as a result. Bacon does a solid job in the title role, easily handling the meglomania that the character displays. Elizabeth Shue is basically wasted in what is little more than a ""damsel-in-distress"" role. The movie moves at a good clip, while the special effects are nothing short of stunning. The classic James Whale film, THE INVISIBLE MAN, with Claude Rains in the title role, is still the best flim of this type. HALLOW MAN, however, does provide a quick paced entertainment. Not a great film, but fun nevertheless."
3,It was a fun movie,"The sexual parts did unerve me, but as a thriller it was pretty good. I liked the effects, and its entertainment value alone didn't let me notice whatever holes the plot had. It just wasn't as bad as I heard, and I don't see what the big fuss is about. I liked it, not LOVED it. But I felt it was worth a rental, but I dunno if I wanna own such a racey film in terms of sexual content. But not bad, and good effects. Especially the gorilla in the beginning."
1,The name says it all...,"I had no overwhelming desire to see this movie; I watched it out of idle (and perhaps morbid) curiosity. I'm almost sorry I did. Despite special effects which are, admittedly, some of the best I've seen, Hollow Man is a thoroughly forgettable movie, with a so-so plot, two-dimensional characters with largely four-letter vocabularies, and an ending that leaves you thinking, ""I wonder what time it is?"" I'm getting quite sick of these formulaic movies where people are portrayed as A. ignorant, and B. dispensable. They've no redeeming qualities, and are a waste of both time and money."
3,Hollow Movie; but interesting special features on the DVD,"Whew, this was a bad film. Not just a hollow man, but hollow men and women. Too bad, since, the idea of becoming invisible is certainly a story with lots of potential. No need to dwell on the shortcomings of the film. But the DVD is worth owning if you're interested in seeing how they generated the special effects. I was very curious about how they filmed each scene, and the featurettes and commentaries were quite educational. I especially liked the picture in picture feature which allowed you to view the scene as it was filmed and the scene as it appeared in the final version. You'll learn a lot about the world of special effects by exploring the extras on this DVD. Also, the score by Jerry Goldsmith was fairly interesting, and you can listen to it in isolation, with occasional commentary from Goldsmith himself."
3,Not much character development,"The concept of the movie was great, however I felt the storyline and character development was really vague. It was disappointing to me and I wouldn't recommend it."
3,"Interesting film, but could have been more","This was a film that actually started off really well. All of the actors did pretty good jobs in their roles throughout the film, but unfortunately, the story/writing kind of unraveled, and this became less of a sci-fi film and more of a horror film after the Hollow Man starts going crazy. This film had the opportunity to explore a really cool concept and it somehow transformed into a cheap B-quality slasher flick.This movie would have benefited by ending in a different direction, because the way it ended was pretty cliched and predictable. It's a shame when films with lots of potential get weighed down by bad plot/writing."
4,UMD Purchase,There was a hiccup at first but was IMMEDIATELY resolved. Absolutely please with the purchase.
1,Special effects don't excuse poorly designed & executed plot,"Horrid! This was an awful remake of The Invisible Man. Yes, the special effects were exciting and gruesome. Isn't modern movie technology wonderful? But...so what? Bacon is not a convincing scientist. Renegade--yes. Madman--absolutely. Letch--he was perfect. However, none of these aspects meshed with him being a scientist. He played out like an adult kid who somehow got permission to fool around with very expensive military-scientific toys.A serious hole in this plot is the notion that the military would fully fund such an over-the-edge project as phase-shifting to create invisibility--and then not demand oversight. We are supposed to believe that a bunch of gen-X scientists would be allowed to run a super-pricey military project without so much as an MP in the laboratory?If you must view this wretched production, borrow it from the library like I did--there is no waiting list."
2,watchable,"The plot is predictable and lackluster. The writing is medicore and the characters are generally unlikeable. Kevin Bacon's performance is good, which is the only reason to watch this film. If you want scary, you won't find it here. If you want a smart movie, you won't find it here. And if you want a good movie, you won't find it here. Kevin Bacon has been in a lot of movies; this is not one of his best."
4,A big bang with a big finale and nothing in between,"This cd starts out with a big Dean Martin favorite and finishes (in the next to last rack) with a big Billy May piece full of attitude. In between those two tracks is little more than fluff meant to take up time (with the exception, of course, of Nat King Cole's number). If you're looking for some classic music to take you from humor to sleepiness to spunk, I recommend this cd. If you're looking for nothing more than one good song--I recommend this cd. If you're looking for much more than that, I recommend you find a better, more consistent compilation."
3,A reasonable book for Intro to Inner Asian history,"This book covers great span of history and geography, it is reasonable intro text to Inner Asian history and will give you a sense of everything, but it tries to cover too much and gives nothing in-depth."
5,An AWESOME video for an AWESOME team.,This is really well made video for a Classy team. A definite Must for any San Antonio Spurs fan.
4,"Good Product, Bad Company Selling It","This is a great product for people who have Sony Palm Pilots. I currently use it for my SJ 22 and it works well. My only complaint is with Amazon.com. They expected that it would take a maximum of two weeks (it was on back-order) to recieve the package then another five days to ship it. After the two weeks came and went, they sent me an e-mail saying that it would take another 1 1/2 to 2 weeks before they recieved it then four or five days before I actually recieved it. Making it a total of 1 month from the time I ordered it til the time I got it! I cancelled my order with them and purchased it through sonystyle.com (luckily I had a 25% off coupon so it was the same price as Amazon) and got it within 6 days."
2,Falls off a cliff...,"The part on Front Screen Projection to fake the moon landing was plausible, but everything else is completely false when it comes to ""The Shining"" the maker of this film should of done some research, because at the very end of the film they show the final shot of ""The Shining"" and the narrator says ""you want to know what that secret paper in jacks hand says, you just did"" The photo wasn't created for the movie, it was a stock photo that they put Jack Nicholson's head onto, thus killing the little credibility the filmmaker had."
1,Save your time and money,"What was I thinking when I paid money for this steaming pile of crap???This film has no connection with the work of Stanley Kubrick. Using the name Kubrick is what lured me into purchasing and then wasting the 70 minutes watching it.It is a desecration of the name, the work and the memory of a great artist.If lunacy gets you off this should work."
1,Grasping at straws.,"The Moon landings weren't faked. This documentary is reaching. If it were under the ""Comedy"" category, I may have rated it higher. Everyone, save your money."
3,Very Well Recorded,"All of the voices on this CD are lovely indeed, though the STYLE of the soloists' singing was not always quite to my liking--somewhat too ""jazzed up"" for my taste, especially for Christmas music. And, as at least one other reviewer has mentioned, too many of the instruments sound synthesized. I DO, however, want to emphasize how very well the choir is recorded and how well the massed choir sings. I think I have never heard a choir better recorded: you can hear individual voices and yet it sounds like a well-balanced choir. As an audiophile, I find this CD well worth owning simply for the effect of the very well recorded choir."
1,"Gladys? Well, she is on the cover...","Yes, as the earlier reviewer mentioned, Gladys does little but make a cameo appearance on this record; she sings lead on perhaps two of the songs, with the remaining tunes ""produced and arranged"" by her with others. The rest of the singing is OK, the instruments are almost entirely sampled or synthesized - not bad, but not great. And, worst of all, not Gladys; I'm disappointed that she'd intentionally mislead her many fans this way. There is nothing on the outside of the case that warns you about Ms. Knight's paltry participation, so it's not until after you buy the thing that you find out you've been duped. Don't bother."
2,"If you were expecting Gladys, think again....","boo... disappointing. Excepted Gladys, got nothing close."
4,How Good People Can Take Control,"This is a clear, amusing and readable account of how Joan Darrah went from being a volunteer leader to become the mayor of Stockton, CA. Her engaging style makes it seem both doable and worthwhile. She recounts how much she was able to do by diplomacy and persuasion to dramatically reduce crime in the city and to take control of the city's development away from the developers and give it back to the people. Inspiring. And she is so likable. You end up feeling as though you have just had a good talk with a fine mentor. I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone concerned about civic affairs."
3,"Bulky, but adequate","This case does the job of carrying around my CLIE, but it is a bit bulky. Sometimes credit cards can fall out of the pockets and that can be a problem. Other PDA carrying devices do a much better job of sealing the PDA off from damage, this case leaves the edges open, and does not stay secure like other metal PDA cases. Sony does not give you an option of going with a metal case, so this is one of the few options available. It will do the job, but don't expect too much of this case."
1,THIS IS NOT A BIBLE!,"This is NOT a Bible, it is one feminist woman's interpretation and her attempt to spread a false gospel. Don't even consider getting it."
1,I did not like this bible.,I tryed to get in this book or bible. I could not do it. There are other women's bibles out there that are better. I took it off my kindle.
1,HERESY,"This ""bible"" is not a bible at all, but is authored by Satan,the father of lies, and is the heretical imaginations of a deceived mind, who, in pride, has re-written portions of God's Word to suit her carnal pride. The title of the book is deceptive, and could lead people into the deception that she has fallen prey to. She is very deceived, and is not ""born again"", otherwise she would recognize the truth about the Trinity, and also she is not Biblically well-read, or she would recognize that Jesus Himself said ""I will send the Holy Spirit and HE WILL LEAD YOU INTO ALL TRUTH."" NOT ""SHE""!!! Poor woman...may God have mercy on her soul, or she will go where all unbelievers go...to the lake of fire.Linnie Robinson (a Christian)"
1,This is not a Bible!,This is not at ALL what I expected...an accurate Bible with commentaries and highlight related to the women's heart. It is a feminist rewrite full of commentary and hogwash. It is not a Bible!! Very disappointed!
1,Bible,"It wasn't what I thought it was. I was looking for an Amplfied bible. It might work some people, but not for me."
2,not 4 me,"Since I am a man, I guess I really miss to point of this, but then it was not written with me in mind."
1,i hate it,was not making sense to controversal and the author did not give me the impression that she was familiar with the holy bible
3,the womans bible,I think this Bible is good. However I prefer the King James Virsion. I am sure I will enjoy this bible when I do Bible studies. I love to compare bibles.
1,To Contemporary for me,I can't understand the theory that was intended in this bible. I was looking for a bible bases on the new International version for women not a complete rewrite.Not for me.
1,Too Liberal,"For an evangelical like me, it compromises the truth of scripture for the sake of Women's Liberation, not that God means that women are inferior to man, but God sent Jesus to save the world, he didn't send a daughter. Men, you should love your wives as you love yourself for no man hates himself, instead he nourishes, feeds and clothes himself. Likewise love your wives and she will love you. Men, take up the challenge and be a leader like God meant you to be in today's world."
1,The Woman's Bible,"I feel too much of the word had taken on a deferent meaning . So as I read the book, I did not feel it was a good buy for me. No longer own the book . Judy"
1,meh,not my favorite version of the bible for women. I ended up deleting it from my kindle. I found another I like.
1,The Woman's Bible,I hate this so called Woman's Bible because it is so biased and unscriptural. It's not the entire Bible but just a few selected passages with comments that are not scriptural.
1,the womens bible,"1 star because i just could get into it ..... blah, blah blah, not my cup of tea i guess"
2,The Woman's Bible,It is hard to look up texts and confusing. As being acusome to other bible versions this seems to lack a significant amount of wording to make it understandable.
3,Isn't complete version.,I thought I was downloading a complete bible. This only has small sections. Not the complete bible. Will have to get a different one.
2,the womens Bible,I disagree with the doctrine. I did read it and the comments some was good but still uncomfortable with the premise
1,boring,This book definitely wasn't what I thought it would be. It's kindda like bible but it's not. Definitely not worth my time.
1,Not what I thought it would be,It is not what I thought it would be. I was looking for a study of different women in the Bible and it seemed to be a look at the Bible from a women's perspective.
1,The Woman's Bible,"I thought I purchased a regular bible with stories about women experiences in between books of the bible. I never read anymore after reading the first couple of pages and read about their version of who the Trinity is. No where in the Bible does it say that the Trinity consists of Father, Mother and Son. I prefer a regular women's bible and not only portions of the Bible that has portions that only include women."
1,Not Great,"If you are looking for a women's bible to compliment your daily reading, this is not the it. Quite disappointing."
1,Woman's Bible,Awful Bible - it is not even really a Bible. I plan to trash this one and not keep it. Don't waste your time.
1,poor purchase,"bought in error, thought I was getting the excellent ""Daily Study Bible for Women"" would not have bought, glad I didn't pay for it, now just got to work out how to delete it!!!"
1,womens bible,"Could not get through the first few chapters, it seem a lot was taken out of context and who ever may have written this book was looking to prove a point not encourage or up lift women. Erased it from my kindle."
2,To confusing,Did not like this version at all as it was too confusing to read and I deleted it right away.
2,Hard to navigate,This book is very hard to navigate through. The beginning credits and introduction are way to long. Need a easier way to find what your looking for. It is a bible and most people don't start with genius and flip through every page to find the verse they are looking for.
1,"Blasphemy, Lies and False Doctrine","Unfortunately, the title of this book misleads one into expecting the WORD of GOD. Instead you get a perversion of scripture. Bible verses are taken out of context and twisted to support false unChristian doctrine. There are so many excellent women's Bibles, it would be a shame for a new believer to download this rubbish and be led away from GOD."
4,Thank you,I've enjoyed this read and appreciate the opportunity to read it. Thank you for sending it back out in a timely manner.
3,Women's Bible,"I did not agree with all the interpretations in this bible. In fact I expected something totally different, however it is readable and really gives feminist points of view that can be quite interesting, even though some ideas are far fetched."
3,How Very Interesting!,"I have not yet read it, only glanced through it. It appears that it was well beyond it's time in seeking equality for women in the Bible. So much has been revealed since, it has me curiousas to what they came up with."
3,Just reviewed,I just reviewed this book and did not keep it on my kindle at this time. I may want to read it more later.
3,Not what I was looking for.,I am sure this is a fine Bible but it was not what I had in mind. I am still looking for something to meet my needs exactly.
1,The Woman's Bible,I was completely surprised and repulsed by its feminist stance. I couldn't bear to read much of it as I believe the Bible is the unerring Word of God. Women's stature in organized church has grown significantly and I would not want my daughter's and granddaughter's minds poisoned by these ideas. I have several women friends who have gone into the ministry and have been very successful. I know this is an old writing but it came off my Kindle the minute I saw the problems Stantan had been trying to express. She must have been a terribly abused girl to have such bitterness.
1,Not a devotional bible for women,wanted a bible with some devotional elements...this was not it. would be best if there was a description before you buy...even at free... interested in the rewrite and commentary
1,Worst piece of feministic sacriligeous piece of crap I've had the misfortune to read,"If I could I would rate this book minus 5 stars. The fact that this author has the gall to call this piece of horsecrap a ""bible"" is a shame and disgrace. Everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but when you write a book calling the Word of God an ""incomplete"" and ""imperfect"" work, and calling it the Bible, you are false teacher, and should be avoided like the plague. I fear for the very soul of the person who wrote this drivel."
1,womens bible,This is a hacked up version of the bible . I would not reccomend this to anyone interestef in the binle
2,Woman's bible,It does not meet my requirements. Do not care for this item. This Woman's Bible does not equal to an average bible contents.
1,Not pleased with book,Was not happy with this book. It is NOT a true Bible. Text has been added and taken away. It is very misleading and incorrect in its message.
2,The Woman's Bible,This book was not what I expected. I thought it would compliment my Bible but it is about things in the Bible and interpreting them in another way. How do I delete it from much kindle?
2,Book not a Bible,"I was under yhe assumption that this was a Bible. It is my fault that I didn't take time to realize what I was getting. I need to use my time in the scriptures right now, later I might have time to read this book."
2,Its a bible,I downloaded this to my account by mistake while trying to download it for my mother's account. I'm not a religious person so it holds no interest to me.
1,Wrong Item,This is not the version I was looking for. I was looking for the Woman's Study Bible New King James Version
1,VERY Misleading,"You may think this author is a wonderful writer, woman, person but the simple fact is she's wrong for naming this book what it is. It's not a Bible period! I personally would not ever read anything she wrote just from reading exerts from this BOOK. Its shameful that it was allowed to be published with such a misleading title and I wonder how many people were tricked into buying this book thinking they were actually buying a TRUE AND FACTUAL BIBLE?"
2,Feminist Take on Bible,"I was looking for a Women's Devotional Bible when I stumbled on this. Was a bit too click-happy for the free Kindle books and ended up downloading this. Turns out to be some sort of feminist version of the Bible which includes: ""God the Mother and God the Father."" (I should have read the reviews before downloading, but at least it is easy to delete.) I am aware that because God created male and female in His image that there are aspects to the feminine nature that come from God. My spouse and I are just the kind of people who prefer a more literal translation of the Bible - ones that are closest in meaning to the original text languages. (Written by the wife.)"
1,This is not a BIBLE at all,"Where do I begin? This should not be called a ""Woman's Bible"" by any means. Instead it should read ""A Specific Woman's Misunderstanding of the Bible."" If the author had attended a bible study, or had theological training, or even been a Christian, this book would not exist. The author tried to explain spiritual truths with a carnal outlook...what a tragedy."
2,I did not like this book,It was not what I expected. Or maybe not what I want to hear. It should not be classed as a bible but I studies of the bible from a particluar point of view. I don't know who's but I don't believe it was a woman.
4,A Help for Women,It gives you an understanding that you would not get unless you read this book with the commentary or went to Bible College.
2,Not what i was looking for,It wasn't the content I was looking for and read more like a novel instead of a bible with biblical clippings or sayings that relate to a proverbs woman. Good read but just not what I thought it was going to be.
5,WONDERFUL POLICE ACTION ANIME,This anime is quite enjoyable.I liked the action scenes alot. Good for all police movies lovers.I strongly recommend it
1,Just about the worst book I ever read,Terrible. Save your $20. Don't waste your time on this piece of crap.
2,No new tale to tell,"Probably the worst romance novel I've ever read. Could have used a little more ""frenetic humor"" and not so much of the ""stark sadness"" anyhow. And the hero doesn't even get laid!"
4,Not what I expected!,"Though this is a good relations/memory builder for marriages, I felt it was good for newly weds or maybe even the ""7 year itch"" syndrome but wasn't much help for my wife and I after 35 years!So, go for it, kids. You'll get the ideas we have enjoyed for years. And, hug her once for me!"
1,Does NOT work for Tredia,"This is a nice looking connector and pigtails, too badit doesn't work for a Tredia. This ""Tredia"" connectoris a universal EIA connector, it has 4 more pins thanwhat the Tredia does have and will not fit. I only keptthe item to use the labeled wires on the wiring harnessI created from the female connector that is on the backof the stock radio."
3,Good Community basics-- fuzzy theology,Peck presents some sound theoretical and practical tools for community building. He focuses more on community building as social action than on bringing geographical groups together for mutual support such as neighborhoods and the more vulnerable. His theology is fuzzy at best and distorts Christianity into a justification for world government. While his intentions around that are honest; his theological gymnastics aren't.
5,Wonderful book on creating real communities,"This is such a wonderful book, that even though I am a fast reader, I find I savour this book, and it's one of very few books that I will read again.As someone who has studied how the next realm works, it should come as no surprise to find that there are similarities in the process that Peck describes. Of course in the next realm the Spiritual Laws create these communities, but what we find in this book is some of the keys to creating a real heaven on earth."
4,heartening to know the signs of community in progress,"I read this book years ago, and it has lived with me since. It's heartening to understand that anger and silence are stages in community building--not signs of its demise. It's good to know, too, that pseudo-politeness must go before real community can flourish.Nearly all of us are members of communities--whether in committed partnerships, friendships, or larger groups. Peck's examination of the lives and deaths of communities offers encouragement to hang in there through anger and emptiness, for the real rewards are coming."
5,"One of the classic best, ""how to do it"" books ever for teaching group interaction and civility",The title of the book speaks for itself. I give this classic to groups that I have joined. Jack Queen Veterans for Peace
4,Peck Mixes Spirituality with Common Sense,"Community isn't what we think it is. Peck does an impeccable job of explaining true community and why it is so elusive in our society. Though he mentions over and over that he is an idealist, Peck presents some very intelligent arguments as to why a community approach just makes sense. He isn't naive either. He says the road to community can be painful and extremely hard."
5,Compact but extremely fragile,"I loved my starter digital camera, once Ifigured out the battery situation. That is,until someone accidentally dropped it.Needless to say, one short trip (in avery light carrying case) from waist highto the kitchen floor, did this camera infor life. If you buy it, handle it carefully.Because it is soooo light, it's easy to fumble it."
1,"used = high risk, medium reward","Thought I would get my son an actual camera rather than those awful ""kid"" cameras with zero features, and this would save an older camera from a landfill, right? Well luckily I bought this way ahead of Christmas - completely failed... all images, pictures and video were just a red haze, like a martian nightmare.Vendor was very nice and prompt about the refund, though, which saved this from being a complete disaster. Found a cheap (about $7 more than this one) new camera, 5MP. Again, light on features, but whatever, it's for a kid."
1,Garbage,"This digital camera stinks--buy something else1. Eats up batteries more than anything, more than any digi camera i've dealt with.2. Delay between pictures sucks.3. The thing doesn't even turn on anymore (new batteries too!)....4. Pictures are good, but after taking two pictures, the battery is dead.5. The picture screen stinks, not very sharp.Save your money, folks."
4,Adam & The Cants.,"I've loved A&A videos since (t)he(y) first appeared on MTV back in the early 1980's. With their rock-a-billy / punkish sound and Adam's charisma, they were perfect for the video format. I would have gave this DVD package a resounding 5 Stars!!! (USA BUYER BEWARE WARNING!!) Unfortunately, I had the same problem as one of the earlier reviewers had: IT WON'T PLAY ON MY DVD PLAYER! How lame is that!? It's 2007, I own a $1000 Surround Sound Theater System and it is NOT compatible to play / view? This sucks BIG TIME! So, off it goes...back to Amazon for a refund until A&A can STAND AND DELIVER a U.S. region DVD set that I can play on my system. What a shame and waste of my time. But I still love the music!"
5,Renewed adoration for Adam Ant,"Anyone remotely interested in Adam Ant should have this.I was originally going to buy Dirk, Kings and Prince Charming but decided that I should have the visuals attached so I purchased this DVD, instead.It's FANTASTIC!!Disc 1 is a joy with all of the videos but Disc 2 is worth it unto itself.A very very very well done documentary that renewed my adoration for Adam.The quips from Marco and acquaintances are priceless!The documentary shows Adam to be even more genius than I ever gave him credit for, previously.Great man. Great product.I just wish that I had an all-range DVD player! Mine is old and I can only watch this on my computer and that is the only detraction from this work.It still gets 5 stars handily, though.Long Live The Ants!!!"
4,No problems here...,"I purchased this TV back in November of 2005 from Circuit City, and have not had any problems with it. My parents had an earlier version of the same 27"" HDTV and were very pleased with it. Theirs is still working after 3 years of use and I have had no problems with mine at all.The HD picture is great, and I like that you can see the full picture from any viewing angle. Being a 27"" TV, it fit perfectly into our living room. Setup was very easy, and the abundance of inputs allows me to have all of my equipment connected at once.I'm sorry other people have had problems, but I would definately reccommend this TV to my friends."
5,Kids and I really enjoy!,"Cute songs, some of which the kids aren't familiar with these days. Very nice and we truly enjoy!"
4,Would you rather be a pig?,"This CD features Capitol Records recording artists performing ""kids songs"". Kids songs is this case are songs based on nursery rhymes, or songs from Disney movies, or silly novelty songs that kids like. The performers are mostly ""pop singers"" from the pre-rock and roll era. People like Nat King Cole, Tony Bennett and the Lettermen. Sadly, Frank Sinatra singing ""Old MacDonald"" is not included. But the songs that are included are pretty entertaining. This is a fun, lighthearted CD."
3,mostly nice,A nice collection of songs whose charmis occasionally marred by overly cutearrangements.
3,A shadow of Wodehouse's early works,"While Wodehouse continued to turn a funny phrase this book did not live up to his earlier works. The plot turns around a gentleman named Biffin who stands to inherit a fortune... providing he doesn't get arrested prior to his 30th birthday. Since Biff's hobby is to get drunk and punch police officers it takes plotting by several of his friends to save Biff despite himself. The trouser sub-plot was a nice touch as well. I certainly recommend this for anyone who is a true fan of Wodehouse and wants to experience the full spectrum of his work. The edition I borrowed, however, had a some printing errors in which two lines on two seperate pages were placed out of order."
3,comb,"This comb is quite large, a little bigger than what I need for my dog.I bought it to get mats out, but it was too big."
4,Pretty much what I expected,"The comb seems well made, and will probably outlast my dog. The only drawback is that it's quite heavy, and might be a bit easier to use if it were a lighter weight. But maybe the weight is a function of quality. On the whole, I'm pleased with it."
1,Teeth fall out,"I've been using this for about a month now and it's missing so many teeth it's time to get a new comb. The handle edges are sharp which makes using it for any length of time uncomfortable.I haven't bent any teeth, they seem very strong, but they fall out."
5,works great,I finally found a comb that my cat doesn't HATE! works well getting out matts of hair and easy to maneuver around the face.
2,"Fun for a couple of days, but not challenging enough.","Fun dance moves, but by the end of the video, I was tired of doing the same routine. The video is not very challenging if you're a dancer or if you're already in good shape. Buy this video if you're out of shape or looking for a fun video to do on lazy days."
4,I miss old MTV workouts...,"Even though their Yoga and Pilates series videos are good, I miss the MTV hip-hop inspired cardio workouts! I wish they would make some new ones. :( I disagree with the reviewer that thought the instruction was poor. I followed along with no problem. The choreography may take you a couple of times doing the video, but that's common with dance workouts. I really like the music they use, tracks by Coolio and Naughty by Nature for example. The only thing that bugged me was the marching in place between moves. I think they needed to keep the intensity up higher, but I guess you can do that on your own. This video is about 50 minutes long."
1,Review from Florida,As a total beginner I thought it went way too fast. I brought a couple of other vidoes that were much better. I thought the camera panned round all of the dancers too much instead of showing how the feet should be moving. I was left trying to figure out which foot should be where! Also I wasn't really into watching people flirt throughtout the video.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I was extemely disappointed in the quality of the ""aerobic"" effect of this video. The dance instructions are NOT for a beginner, nor is there any continuity. This is definately not a video for the benefit of obtaining a cardiovascular workout. It's fast with a lot of stop & go to figure out what they are doing. There's very little instruction and almost impossible for a viewer to keep up without having to rewind to learn the steps. Spend your money on some exercise equipment!"
5,Eric Nies is sooooooooooo good lookin',"This tape is fun for me mostly because of beautiful, gorgeous Eric and the really great music. There's also this black guy in it that is so buffed he looks like a statue of a greek god. Get this if you're tired of girls in leotards (It's much better to look at Eric!!!)"
3,I thought it was fun and a great way to stay fit!,"I think the workout was really good, but Lynda should have spent a little more time worrying about herself, other than sitting there flirting with Eric Neis the whole time! Poor guy, he tries to spend almost an hour working out and he's got this crazy lady on him!"
1,NOT for beginners or unexperienced in dance,"I thought this video, was A.Poorly done, B. To Fast. Not to mention the whole time all the instructors are flirting with each other. I didn't feel like there was enough focus on the dance or instruction. Took me a day or two to get the hang of it. It was fun for like one day I have not used this video since then. Also the video movement of the camera all the time, awful!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!,"I was extremely disappointed in the exercise quality of this video. There is too much stop & go to even work up a sweat. The instructions are poor, even for a dance student. You need to stop and rewind the video to learn the dance steps. ""That's the real exercise!"" It is poor quality and definitely does not provide a cardiovascular workout!"
4,Grindin',"...I do like the music in this video, because it's upbeat and goes along with the moves. The stretching in the begining and end is great. In this viedo they show you a dance move and then break it down and then do it at tempo. It took me a lot of rewinding to get the fun moves down. But once you know the whole routine and moves you can do it at clubs and parties. I didn't sweat a whole lot during this workout, probably becasue of all the breaking the move down."
4,Do you love to dance?,"If you hate exercise, but love to dance, this video is absolutely for you! Yes, Eric is full of himself, but the music & beat make it easy to ignore. The music is awesome, the dancers are full of energy, and you will sweat! The instructions are bad, but if you grew up in this era and enjoyed going to clubs, you will have no problem. If you didn't know the moves to start with remember, it is a tape, you can practice it as many times as you need to! I've tried some of the other Grind workouts and this is the only one I like because it is the least like an exercise video than the rest of them are. The other tapes have a different instructor, and do not seem to be as fun as this one is."
3,"Pretty good, could maybe be a little more intense","This is a high-energy workout. The moves are very fast-paced. You feel like you're dancing a party for 90 minutes. There are some parts in the video that I wish were a little more intense or faster paced. Overall, it's a good aerobic workout, though."
4,Fun and motivating,"Let's be honest, it's a 90's video, this is the 2000's, some things are going to be outdated. Fun and motivation are not outdated though. The workout is what you make out of it. Once you learn the moves you can make it as intense as you want. Instead of marching it out while the moves are reviewed, you can challenge yourself a little and do your own thing. Try to see how many times you can do the move fast while they break it down. It's all up to you. I always break a sweat, I always hit my target heart rate and I always have fun. This work out got me in shape once before and it will again."
1,cheaper to purchase every season seperate!,Why does it cost less to buy each season seperately than this whole series. That makes no sense at all!
1,NEVER GOT THE BOOK ITS BEEN ALMOST A MONTH NOW!,"I am still waiting for this book to ship to me, I ordered it about four weeks ago. Don't use this seller."
2,20 qt dutch oven,"Product looked great. Might have worked, IF IT WERE NOT BROKEN TO BUPKIS when it arrived, both times. Packaging was terrible. As a result, my son was very disappointed that he did not receive his Christmas gift."
5,the first HIM record debuts in america,"dont confuse it with the first him record TO debut, because that would be DARK LIGHT. GSL is the first record HIM ever made, and it's finally in america...i love it, i just wanted to be the first one to review that's all. props to me."
5,Good Goth Album?,"Well HIM do concider themselves ""goth"" anyway. This album is by far the BEST HIM album ever released. I have all their albums and their all great (read my reviews) but this one is The BEST both music wise and lyrically. I bought this album in amazon as an import a few months back but hopefully HIM do get around to releasing this commercially because it would be a great waste of a good album like this that never gets nationwide release. Best songs for me are:It's All Tears (Drown In This Love)Beginning Of The EndWicked GameHeartlessDon't Fear The Reaper"
4,Very good...,"I recently bought this album and I'm glad I did. I was debating whether to get this or the new album (Venus Doom). Out of all of the HIM albums I own, this one is my favorite so far. I like this album's version of ""Your Sweet Six Six Six"" over Razorblade Romance's re-recording. I have yet to purchase Venus Doom or Love Metal so, we'll see..."
3,It is an ok cd,"Alright Him in my opinion is a great great band. Villes voice is one of the best of today. Linde is a good at guitar. Burton is a great piano player, and gas and mige are good at wut they do. The first cd i ever bought was Razorblade romance and i thought it was amazing. This was the second cd i bought and i didnt rly like it. First of all it is much heavier than their other cds. Villes voice is pretty good on this cd but not his best by any means. I also find the recording to be pretty bad. LIke all there cds there are great songs Its All Tears, Heartless, and When Love and Death embrace are all great songs. They also do an amazing cover of Blue Oyster Cults ""Dont Fear The Reaper"". The rest of the cd i have to say is not very good. I give it all in all 3 1/2 stars."
2,meh.,"Everyone seems to love this band and I can't figure out why... They're okay but not great, I grew up on goth and industrial rock and compared to some of the older bands these guys just sound bland and cliched. I mean, you can tell that the lead singer is DESPERATELY trying to sound like Peter Murphy, come on.Oh well, I guess they're better than most of their contemporaries, anyway, which is probably why I stopped listening to this type of music in the nineties.If you want something better but in a similiar vein go to a used record store and dig up an old bauhaus, christian death or sisters of mercy album."
1,terrible,"this is the worst hard/heavy album i heard in ages (together with limp bizkit, papa roach, kid rock, 3 doors down etc.) calling this gothic is a shame for any fan of goth music. the vocalist tries to imitate peter steele of type o negative, but he doesn't succeed. the music is typical mainstream music, simple and stupid. while this may not be well known in the u.s. it definitly is in germany. this is typical mainstream junk."
1,One good song... the rest are dull and monotonous,"As the title said, there is only one good song on this album... Your Sweet 666. The rest are so pathetic I threw the album in the trash right away. The singer sounds like a Backstreet Boy on depressants. ""Love Metal"" is bull. Take the instruments of, say, Creed and add the lyrics of N Sync mixed with Manson (N Sync's sappy lyrics, Manson's slightly creepy, evil-tinged lyrics) and the vocal sound of the Backstreet Boys. If that sounds like a good mix to you, I'd suggest this album to you right away. If you're like me and find this to be appalling, avoid this album at all costs."
3,What!!,"LOL, What is this stuff? For that price I can pour white vinegar in there and soak it clean for many many years."
3,good!,I received a different product than the one i ordered and paid for. it was suppossed to be superior... i accepted it and it works... i see no difference in results for cleaning my water carafe ... thanks!
5,Great Bluray,Really impressed with the superior quality of the bluray. The songs are pretty good. $46 is too high for a Bluray. I think it should be less than $20. I don't know why Indian blurays are so expensive. The average price for a Tamil bluray is $30. Most of the Hindi moves are reasonably priced.Yash Raj BluRays are superb. Keep up the good quality.
3,One of Pare's best movie,"I'm the fan of Michael Pare, i've watched some of his greatest movies (which available in Indonesian Market)and i always enjoy it. I like this movie, the story not bad, acting is ok, and the sex scenes is hottt (Pare with Tweed ). Unfortunately most of his (Pare) movies not available in dvd format, i think that it would be great if it had as i like to have dvd collection for Pare's movies (Point of Impact, Womens Club, etc)."
4,Hooper's Performance is The only good reason to watch,"The movie [was weak], but Dennis Hooper's performance is just plain awesome. The only reason I liked to watch the film... :-). No but seriously, vintage Hooper at his best in the film is only reason to buy it, I couldn't stop laughing at some of the scene Hopper did...."
5,Helpful for preaching,Thiselton's reflection and application questions at the end of each section are very helpful for preaching week to week. I would recommend this shorter book to any pastor looking for that type of commentary.
3,midnight star the anniversary collection,"I wish they had the original music on all the tracks, some of them sounded spacey cause they were remixed."
4,Solid Career Overview,"The Right Stuff label continues to release compilation CD's of Solar Records core audiences. I highly recommend the Shalamar, Lakeside and Whispers Best of's that are out there. And this is a good one, too. As a fan of ""Midas Touch"" I was pleasantly surprised to find that the rest of these songs brought back Old School memories, as well. Basically, these are good songs. Old School, lives."
4,this disc is slammin',"so many jams&grooves.no parking on the dance floor,midas touch,wet my whistle.i never get tired of grooving to there synth funk jams.these jams still can rock a house party."
2,Wasted My Money,"I like to buy the Greatest Hits CD's from all of my favorite groups from back in the day, but it just doesn't seem like those who put these things together are really in touch with what was being played on the radio. Maybe I just wasn't as big a fan of Midnight Star as I thought. My two favorite cuts are ""Wet My Whistle"" and ""Midas Touch"". But, for those who were big fans of theirs, I'm sure you will enjoy ""Make It Last"" and ""Freak-A-Zoid"" and others. I was more into The Sylvers (which I still have there albums but would like to find a good compilation CD), Switch, and Shalamar."
3,Fun Read,"This book gives you some good insight into Law and Law School. It is filled with some funny stories, practical cases, and shows how the system works through the eyes of a law professor."
4,PRODUCTIVE,That seems to be easy to praise good works... nothing better than being into the Law affairs through this complete manual.
3,"Entertaining, but ANNOYING...","Entertaining and generally useful account of what layman ought to know, seriously marred by endlessly irritating attempts at gender equity, using feminine pronouns in the most contrived and annoying examples. Yes, we know women occupy more and more positions in male society, but according to Feinman women pick pockets, drive trucks, hunt deer, and tackle fleeing robbers with such frequency that describing these actions as ""hers"" wouldn't strike anyone as laugh out loud silly. The whole attempt strikes the reader as some kind of neurotic attempt to please his mother, or his wife, or his cat."
1,Compatibility problem,"I just bought a Clie PEG-SL 10, and this cradle is advertised as the right one for PEG-S series. WATCH OUT! does not fit into the PEG-SL10...though it is advertised as compatible for all PEG-S series. I am retuning it."
3,Propeller without enough data,"The propeller works. The description does not list the hub or hole size. It is about 1mm hole and 5mm hub I was able to drill out to 3 mm and run at 22,000 Rpm without it exploding. Not enough thrust at this altitude 8000 ft so I am getting a 4""x4"" prop and cutting it down to fit plane."
2,give me my money back,"I have one of these ""antijam"" staplers. Have had it about a year. Somewhere along the way it just stopped functioning properly. Thought it was the staples so ordered some new ones. When you put in new staples, it works perfectly -- one time. Then you have to remove the staples, re-insert them....and it works again. Same thing every time. Can't remember where I bought it. Can't find a contact address for Stanley Bostitch. I'm just stuck."
2,just dont drop it,"it worked fine until my coworkers droped it, and broke it. it still works but I have taped it, so when it needs staples I un-tape it and re-tape it."
2,"Does the job, but too bulky","Bought this to use on trips, to recharge and connect my PEG-T615C to laptop. The official Sony ""solution"" for traveling more than a couple of days (the battery doesn't last much longer) consists of two separate items: a cradle-less USB connector to synch, and a power supply. (The power supply is the same that comes with the cradle, but with a connector for the handheld.) Some genius decided they could maximize profit that way, but it is almost as bulky as a second cradle. I wish they offered a single USB cable capable of recharging the handheld (Targus offers such a cable but not for the PEG-Ts)"
3,Yet another blatant attempt to impugn the founding father,"The author's work is certainly exhaustively researched, and thus has much to offer to any student of Washington, and of slavery itself. However, I take umbrage to the notion of conducting a limited analysis on the character of Washington, as inferred solely from his reluctant acceptance of the institution of slavery. Had the author been born into a southern plantation family in the late eighteenth century, I wonder if his intractable views on slavery would have been quite as pronounced."
5,Not another let-me-show-you-how book....,".... but is a let-me-explain-to-you-why book. The authoer (Tim Ewald) obviously has a clear unerstanding of how COM+ was designed, and how the different features it offers can be used to get the best out of it. It explains the basic concepts in a very clear way, and develops them briniantly. While reading a book, I always keep notes of questions I need to get answers for later, and not before long, I could find the answers in the following pages. I have no interest in promoting the book, but I think everyone whether experienced or a bigenner should get this book. Beware though, that you need to understand basic COM, threading and component-based development concepts to be able to keep up and get the most out of the book."
3,You should know....,All the code examples are in C++. A VB developer should look elsewhere for COM+ instruction.
5,great!!!,I love it. Better than I thought it would be. The install is super easy with two people. Highly recommend to anyone.
1,Cheap,"Whaddayawant for a $30 guitar? Somewhat disappointed when I received the sunburst model, since I had ordered ""Natural"". Aside from that, the intonation sucks. Only somewhat satisfying as a slide, where intonation is up to you the consumer."
1,You get what you pay for,"This guitar is a cheap piece of junk. Which I expected, for $30. Mine came with strings and a bag, but the strings the guitar ships with are too heavy--I thought they were going to break the guitar's body. Intonation is absolutely terrible--I suspect they changed design, or started buying fretboards from a different supplier--without doing any math. Either they used the wrong fretboard, or they glued the bridge on in the wrong place. It's wrong by half an inch. For guitars, that's a huge error--it means anything past the second fret is out of tune.Do not buy this guitar for someone looking to learn to play. It will disappoint them."
3,Good for the price,Fun to play around with. Obviously not the same quality as higher priced instruments but worth the money.
4,movie with a good message,"This is one of my favorite movies bec it was shown every summer at the camp I worked at. My friends and I have most of the lines memorized and it is a tradition to say them out loud while watching it. Sort of like Rocky Horror only Christian. Anyway the plot centers on the escape of the very much feared Cahill brothers and the kidnapping of a blind preacher and his family by the brothers. Oh, but the blind preacher has a secret and it has to do with one of the brothers. I recommend this movie bec it might be a little cheesy but it has a good message."
4,NOT HER BEST BUT GOOD ENOUGH,"I'm a die hard Anne Stuart fan and have even gone to great (and sometimes expensive) lengths to purchase her earlier works (get RITUAL SINS at all costs!). While this was not her best book, even AS's almost perfect books are great. I really liked SHADOW LOVER better than this one - better mystery and character development - but AS gives us our dark anti-hero and that's why we buy her books. Right? AS fans won't be disappointed. We need more writers like her and Linda Howard."
4,superchefblog recommends this book to fan of many kinds,"Today's Kitchen Cookbook appeals to all kinds of different fan -- for celebrities, chefs, even for the ""Fab Four"" of NBC's Today Show itself. Many of the recipes are quite goog -- but the packaging is celebrity, not food.Read more at <a href=""http://www.superchefblog.com/2005/09/todays-kitchen-cookbook.html"">http://www.superchefblog.com/2005/09/todays-kitchen-cookbook.html</a>."
1,doesn't sharpen pencils,"Looks very well made...only problem is that it won't sharpen pencils. I've tried dull pencils and brand-new pencils. Something seems to be holding the pencil away from the the blade, so it gnaws at the wood, but the pencil doesn't get sharpened. It was a gift, so I don't have the receipt, carton, or patience to return it. What a waste."
3,It's okay....design flaw perhaps?,"Right out of the box the battery compartment is an issue. It appears to slightly stick ""out"" as though the batteries were too big for it. In order for it to work I had to apply pressure to the battery cover while I attempted to sharpen the pencil. I actually think it's the connectors inside yet when I tried to adjust them a bit (so the battery cover would be flush with the bottom) the batteries didn't/couldn't connect to provide power. It's very touchy. If I set it on the table and press the battery end down it will work, but it shouldn't have to be that way.In regards to sharpening, it seem to take a while but it did make an excellent point without breaking the lead off or eating the entire pencil."
1,Total piece of crap,The motor broke the very first time I put a pencil in it. I returned it. Get one that plugs in.
3,Bostitch Battery Desktop Pencil Sharpener,"Three stars only because it really isn't very good. One has to force the pencil down to a degree that causes even new batteries to labor, and the point is still not what one had hoped. Maybe this is the best they can do."
1,Do not buy!!,-Worked poorly once then just stopped working altogether...Do not waste your money. I ignored the bad reviews and paid for it. :-(
1,Didn't work,I put new batteries in this and it will NOT sharpen any pencils. It runs and your pencil will look like the sides were shaved a bit but nothing more. Annoyed!
1,It's really not worth it!,"It's really hard to use, I bought mine from college store in Art Center, NEVER WORKING after I bought it. It's eating led, and black led covered the WHOLE PENCIL from the led to wood part. DO NOT BUY IT it's really bad product."
5,Great Fun,"I got this for my 8 year old. Both she and her 5 year old sister LOVE it. My daughter loves to make up songs and it is a thrill for her to hear them coming out of the radio. She feels like a real rock star. I saw the other review that said her child had to stand right next to the radio or the mic didn't work, but we have found the range to be great. My daughter can even go into another room than the radio and the mic still works really well. Super fun. Her friends all love it too. I plan on buying it to give as birthday presents for her friends."
1,Waste of money...,My daughter is a huge fan of the Bratz and really wanted this item. The first one we bought didn't work at all and we had to return it. The second one we bought worked but only and only if the radio was playing and she was standing pretty close to it.
5,Its about time!,"The other services came out with a similar book years ago. Every time I walk into a book store I immediately go to the military section with the hope of finding this book waiting for me on the shelf. I always left feeling disappointed. This book retails for about 75 bucks. Some may say that is too high a price for a book, I say it is worth every penny. Semper Paratus."
5,Great History,Great book to have on your coffee table for friends to see your history with and the history of the Coast Guard.
2,product damage/appearance,Spine of the book was split in 2 place and outside was marked up and a bit dirty
5,Great Movie,"Great movie, the story is a bit exagerated in comparison to Sosai Oyama's life, but it has a lot of true aspects of his life. Long live Kyokushin!"
4,Angel of Darkness,It was a very interesting read. The characters had great personalities. Once you start reading it is hard to put down.
3,Short almost merge of what could be two novels,"So the book was good, but it not only ended very abruptly, but was almost two stories in one. It could have been split in two and fleshed out more to be better."
5,"""Mastering Herbalism"" by Paul Huson","""Mastering Herbalism"" is a very informative book on herbs. Paul Huson talks about making incense, cooking, Witchcraft and Wortcunning and the hidden properties of them. ""Mastering Herbalism"" also includes a descriptive chapter on herbs themselves"
5,One of the best--,"This book is a cornerstone of my library. This book covers the uses of herbs since ancient egyptian times into the modern. Ancient recipies for healing, health, perfumery, and of course incenses are included. There is also a large section regarding the use of herbs in cooking.There is practical, concise info regarding herb propogation and how to maintain a garden.Over time the price of this book waxes and wanes, depending on availability, so if you can find it at a reasonable price, go ahead and pick up a copy. . .you won't be dissapointed."
4,Useful and Insightful,"This book is very suitable for people with Asperger syndrome who are conducting their job search independently or semi-independently, and who are interested in finding a career, not just a job. The author herself has Non-Verbal Learning disorder, and a large part of the book is devoted to contributions from other people with Non-Verbal learning disorder or Asperger syndrome, describing their experiences of employment. The later chapters look in depth at the issues, and provide lots of information and advice on the application procedure and dealing with your employers. Interestingly, the author recommends non disclosure to employers, and instead suggests being honest about yourself and how you are without giving people labels. This is definitely a book for people who want to be taken seriously."
1,Highly dissappointing,"I was hoping for some insight to help my 13 year old make some choices as he enters high school. This book offered me nothing, other than to bring on anxiety because of all the negativity in it. It was full of just chapters of individual Aspie experiences, MOSTLY BAD experiences. Chapter after chapter would say the same thing: try to find what you are good at, then emphasize the positive and try to work around the negatives.The book offered no real direction or help, just sob stories."
1,crappy record player,"I got this for my husband for his birthday. OOPS. His parents had a similar one, so I thought it would be fine. Actually, the first time we tried to adjust the volume, the knob broke off. It was very cheaply made. We sent it back and did not order a replacement. I didn't have any problem with the return."
3,"Very good, but read this first ...","The music deserves five stars & this collection contains all major & minor hits that the great group had, but the reason for the 3 stars is that all songs are in their 45 rpm versions! This may not bother some, but for the TRUE fan (like me), this will be very annoying.For those of us who need something more, buy the 12"" collection here on Amazon. This is an import from Canada & a little more expensive (about $$$), but MUCH better. This one also collects all the hits & all of the long versions at that. To have Uptown Festival in its' complete form after all these years is great!See what kind of a fan you are & make your decision off of that. Hopefully you will make the 12"" choice ..."
5,Great Collection,"This is a fairly comprehensive collection of Shalamar's hits. ""Take That to the Bank"", ""The Second Time Around"" and ""A Night to Remember"" are all fantastic soulful dancefloor grooves that you can't help but love. Jody Watley was the vocalist who went on to have a short but successful solo career in the late 80's, but this stuff is even better and certainly more mellow. Sample the tracks above (perhaps not the forgetable ""Uptown Medley"")and I'm sure you will like!Oh yeah and i agree the cover art is dreadful!!"
5,Finally! A compilation worthy of Shalamar,"It's been a long time coming, but Shalamar finally have a compilation worthy of their legacy. And what is that legacy? Along with Ray Parker Jr., they made some of the best black-pop of the late70's/mid-80's. All the hits are here, and even if the final 2 tracks (which don't feature Howard Hewett) aren't much this is still a great listen. One note to Right Stuff. How about dumping the cheap cover art, which are also on the Lakeside and Whispers compilations. Shalamar and the rest of the Solar gang deserve better."
5,Shalamar make you feel good,"If you want ""feel good"" music then you cant beat Shalamar. Okay, so some of your favorites are missing here, but then again Shalamar just made too many good records to put them all on one disc, so if that's how you feel then buy the original albums - Big Fun, Three for Love, Go for it, Friends, The Look and Heartbreak. These are the six which feature Howard Hewett (all except Heartbreak also feature Jody Watley and Jeffrey Daniel). But if you're just after a taster then any ""best of Shalamar"" should do the trick."
4,Oldie but Goldie,This CD brings back memories of the good old days when music was music and you could understand the lyrics. I enjoy Shalamar. It's a classic.
2,not the original cuts,"These are cuts redone later. They do a pretty good job...but ""the second time around"" isn't as good as the first."
1,Refurbished Lexmark Ink Cartridge,"Bought 2 sets of black and color ink combo. Used 1 black cartridge and the ink ran out about twice as quickly as a typical ink cartridge. The other black cartridge has leaked ink in its unopened packaging and is unusable. Will return that bad black cartridge and the two color ones to the seller. The cartridges are not even a Lexmark brand as the seller claims, but of a generic brand. Don't waste your time and money buying this product."
3,Lexmark Ink,"Did not like the fact that the print cartridges were not in the original boxes. To me this indicates that they are outdated. So far they are working fine, but time will tell."
1,BAD COMPANY,"We ordered the cartridges, the black ones did not work. I ordered two black and neither one of them worked. I called and talked to someone. He told me to return them which is what I did. They came back to me, NO SUCH ADDRESS. I was out $30.00 plus postage. DON'T ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY."
1,This is not the Lexmark I expected,"I thought was purchasing original Lexmark cartridges. However, they are refills of Lexmark cartridges. Going back and rereading, I see that they are listed as refills. That's fine but I quickly found that they are not the same quality as the originals. The price is certainly right if you don't mind the reduced quality. For me it wasn't, so I went to Staples and bought the real thing."
5,TLC,"""Received product promptly. But 1st color ink cartridge was defective. Contacted seller and in return they sent a new one out right away. I was very pleased with the way they handled it as soon as they became aware of the situation. I would most certainly do business with them again. Item was the real thing, Lexmark brand, not a substitute. Highly recommend this seller. """
5,Just what I wanted,"Sent quickly, delivered as advertised, no muss or fuss. Just what I was looking for and at a reasonable price. I would buy this again."
3,It's toner. Always pricey.,It's black and color toner. Nothing special. Gets to you in average time. It wasn't dried up or used. Not much more to say.
2,lexmark ink combo,"Have not yet used the color cartridge; however, my printer will not align properly after inserting the new??? black cartridge. I get a message to remove the tape ( which I had already done). I can print, but the result is very light. I am wondering if this was truly a new pack or a refill?"
1,Stuck with one star -- it deserves none!,Howard the Dreck is unbearable! Someone below actually said she is hoping and praying for a sequel (fat chance). That's like hoping and praying for a root canal! Among the worst pieces of (garbage) ever to escape from Hollywood. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!
2,The wonders of being a kid,"I first saw this movie when i was about 9 or 10, back then I found it entertaining. Today I was just thinking how corny this movie can be. No real plot, but the special effects were intersting and are pretty good. Bad acting all around really hurt this movie.. hell, even back then I knew it was bad acting. I just sat around making jokes about this movie with my friends, which is about the only thing you can do with this movie, unless you want the tradition to continue and make your kids watch it so they can grow up and wonder how they ever sat through this movie and not laugh themselves stupid. Not really worth the price of owning, this is one of those movies you watch on TBS, TNT, UPN, or WB on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon to pass time."
4,"Doll..., I don't drink out of bowls. You got a beer?","Where's the DVD already!!?? No matter how bad people think this movie sucked, they still have to admit that it's 100 times better than 90% of the commercialized Hollywood simple simon B.S. that the media throws out annually! I mean compare Howard with the new Fantastic Four movie! No comp! People that hate on Howard the Duck are people that take certain films too seriously. Its not Casablanca or Citizen Cane, it's Howard the Duck! Of course it's not going to have an ingenious plot. It's supposed to be campy and unbelievable! The same people who critizise Howard love Star Wars Episode 1 which was a far inferior film despite its big budget special effects! The bottom line is that the Dark Overlords scare sheepish Hollywood moviegoers and so they put on Spider-Man because the Green Goblin is less intimidating and the special effects are much more up to date."
4,Glad they finally released it,my girlfriend had been wanting this on DVD forever and i'm glad they finally released it... the movie itself is OK... it's no star wars thats for sure
5,Howard The Duck,"I really like this movie it's funny and clean which is hard to find these daysThank You!Yours Truly,Grandma :)"
2,Howard the Duck,"It was a great movie when I was 18, spent years talking about Howard the duck only to be disappointed with technology these days it shows just how sad the acting was back then, still love Howard though. Would be funnier after a few beers."
4,This Duck was a pleasant suprise,"After being dragged by my family in front of the TV to watch this movie, I prepared myself for yet another horrible film that my family always seems to pick out. But as I sat on the couch getting ready to hate this movie, I really started to like it. The slightly bizzare, improbable, and innane plot has it's charm. And without a doubt it's fresh, I mean honestly, how many movies have you seen where the lead actor is a talking duck? Not many I'm guessing."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!,"This movie has to be one of the greatest movies I have seen. Atleast it is about one of the greatest movies to be made in the 80's. I think this because this movie makes me laugh and I can watch it over and over again without getting bored. I think Lea Thompson played her role very well like she does in all of her movies and TV shows. I aslo think the music in the movie is a good selection. Everyone has to see this movie. I HOPE AND PRAY THEY WILL MAKE HOWARD THE DUCK 2. They probably won't but I hope they do and so do all the other fans of the movie. The critics gave it a bad review. They probably convinced everyone not to see it. But if they did that to you, see it anyway. We all have our own opinions. They might have different ones then what you think. So do yourself a favor...GO RENT THE MOVIE!!!"
1,Return of the Deadly Quack,"No revisionism here: ""Howard the Duck"" (1986) remains a cinematic turkey of the highest caliber. The DVD ""special edition"" proves that time is definitely not on its side. Lea Thompson and Tim Robbins managed to survive this big-budget fiasco with their careers intact, but director Willard Huyck was not so lucky. Proceed at your own risk!"
1,A Justly Reviled Disaster,"Folks, even George Lucas, the man who gave us Hayden Christensen as Annakin Skywalker, knows this movie SUCKS. Why do you think it has taken so long for this vile bit of nonsense to slither onto DVD?I saw it when it was first released. It SUCKED then. It SUCKED when I saw it on video a few years later.The movie SUCKS. It is not an undiscovered classic, or an unfairly trashed movie that is so so much better than you've heard.HOWARD THE DUCK SUCKS. Don't be fooled."
1,Howard the Turkey!,"I'm sorry. No, really! I'm sorry I ever saw this movie. Besides the cheesy duck costumes and the fully inappropriate bestiality references, this film was imminently forgettable. Don't waste your money."
4,A Look Back,"I just happened to be at Walmart and happened upon this little (ahem!) gem. Well, back when it made its debut, gem wasn't exactly the word most critics (and some moviegoers) had for it. Needless to say, Howard The Duck was anything but a blockbuster. I happened to be a fan of the Marvel comic it originated from and I did see this film back when it came out and I did enjoy it! Some people just didn't get it. It's a movie about a talking duck from outer space, people! What were you expecting? Dog Day Afternoon? It's nice this underrated film finally got its day on DVD. The extras are also nice too. In closing, seeing this movie again takes me back to my childhood. It's nice to look back once in a while and remember actually having fun. Howard The Duck, ladies and gentleman. Expensive bomb, now a cult movie. Oh, and I got it for five bucks."
5,DVD,weird film but I couldn't believe the duck _uck scene.... got me alittle excited... I must be a sick prick... Funny movie good price fast delivery
3,Get Over It,"Oh get over it! Everyone calls this movie the worst ever, and it's not even close. While no one would be stupid enough to try to rank it as anywhere near the best movie ever, it still is definitely not the worst. It's fun. It has cool effects. Some hilarious parts. And a little skin (although some of it is covered with feathers). It's actually one of those movies that is so stupid it's cool. Just like the Howard the Duck comics of the late 70's. It should be a cult classic. I know it is at my house. I plan to buy it just as soon as it comes out on DVD."
1,Very Unsatisfied Customer,"I purchased a dvd from this company in good faith that the dvd would work. Once I received the movie I went to play it, it would work in any of my dvd players or computer. Come to find out it was a region 2 dvd that would only play in Europe. The seller not once mention this is his review or else I wouldn't have wasted my time ordering it plus waiting the month I waited to receive it. All of this could have been avoided if the seller put all the correct information from the beginning. So I was a very unhappy customer."
1,Absolutely Dreadful!!!!,Howard the Duck is absolutely dreadful!The only good that came out of this movie was Tim Robbins and Lea Thompson and I'm surprised that Howad the Duck didn't destroy their careers like it did some of the other actors in this abomination!
1,Howard the Dud,"Well I can honestly say that I have enjoyed some cheesy bizarre movies the kind that are so bad that they are funny but Howard the Duck was simply just bad and bizarre but not funny at all and though I don't always agree with the professional critics I'm in complete agreement with them that this is one of the worst movie ever made and truly is the worst thing that came out in the 80's. I like Tim Robbins, Jeffrey Jones and Leah Thompson but this movie is so beneath them! I love George Lucas but WHAT WAS HE THINKING!!!!!!!"
1,Exactly what I needed,"We're having an office Christmas party and the theme for the white elephant gift exchange is to bring the worst movie you've ever seen. Howard the Duck fits that criteria very nicely. Too bad I can't give it zero stars -- too bad I can't give it negative stars. It's a real stinker -- written, directed, and produced by cocaine-addled 1980s Hollywood. Phewww."
2,Lost in Translation,"This is a bad movie based on an excellent comic book. It's a great example of the problems that arise when you try to translate one medium into another. Still, it has its charms, and it means well. I gave it two stars, because the film is a fun way to kill ninety minutes, especially if you have some friends over and give it the Mystery Science Theater treatment. I recommend following it up with some Challenge of the Super Friends DVDs for a night of complete grade Z kitsch. Take it from this ""hairless ape"", you could do a lot worse!"
2,Not Lucas' worst...,"Pretty bad,even considering the satirical comic book is essentially unfilmable. The idea of Howard in the completely phony looking duck suit was,to say the least,a bad idea. Something animated,along the lines of Roger Rabbit,or Mr. Limpit,would have worked better,but the script is horrendous in any case.I only give this 2 stars since Lucas has done numerous movies which are even WORSE,for example,the last couple of Star Wars movies.Howard the Duck was a pretty strong signal that Lucas was just a hack."
3,a Quassic,"This is one of those, ""I just had to buy it"" quirky classics. I will probably watch it one more time in my life time but definitely enjoy the flash back. Oye the Pat Benatar hair action going on in this movie. I love it!"
4,awesome movie,this movie was great. it really takes me back. i would recommend it to anyone who likes the 80's genre.
3,A mess of a movie... that shot an arrow straight to my heart,"Howard the Duck is a mess. There's some disturbing adult humor at the beginning and a sluggish diner scene and chase that get in the way of the climax. Even so, I find it to be silly fun, mostly for the performances by Lea Thompson and Tim Robbins.It would be interesting to see a special edition that tightened things up and made it more family friendly."
1,Howard the Dud!,Howard the Duck the most bad movie I ever seen! I can see why it failed in it's theater releases. Yuck! This movie is an insult to ducks every where!
1,Holy-Crap! Give me my money back damnit!,This movie sucked. Case closed. George Lucas was smart to dis-own it. I dis-owned my copy into the trash.
1,Howard The Schmuck!,"I watchted the movie Howard The Duck on cable and even though I have liked my share of silly, campy movies I really didn't like this movie and thought it was horrible. You would have to be drunk or on drugs to like or understand this movie! I like Lea Thompson though and I'm glad she was still able to continue her acting career after this movie."
3,If a duck talks in an empty theater will anyone hear it?,"Apparently yes they did, as it is a fave of some reviewers here! And I'm on that list. This is a fun film, though clearly not a great one. The creator (Steve Gerber) of HTD was ignored and had to sue to get the rights back. If they had consulted him this film would be better. The comic book was more satirical and Howard was less obnoxious in it. And despite the description of the film here, there was a man (little person) in the costume, That in my opinion was a mistake. Having Howard be animated in a live action world would have made it much better as a film as Roger Rabbit proved a few years later. Give it a try!"
2,Duck out while you still can.,"This movie for the most part is bad. Another bad Marvel adaption with not much going for it. Sure it has Lea Thompson but the film sans rhyme and reason which is what lead to negative reviews. I must admit there is some unintentional humor but not enough. Although this flick isn't the worst Comicbook adaption. (Captain America is far worst) This flick is still lacking. Good special FX,a few mildly diverting moments and unintentional amusement raise the entertainment level a notch. For those looking for a good movie are well asvised to give this one a pass,Those looking for cheesy moments and those who love to mock the 80's are advised to check out the flick. But only to mock it."
1,Downright horrible,"Just simply one of the worst movies to ever exist! Bad acting, bad costumes, bad dialogue. I am surprised to know that Lea Thompson, who played Lorraine McFly on Back To the Future was on this piece of garbage. This movie has really tarnished the good name of George Lucas. Stay away, and if you must watch it, see if TNT or TBS might show it."
1,nasty,this movie is nasty the whole way through the movie this duck and this human woman fall in love with each other. at some scenes the two sleep together i believe. that love is the whole way through the movie. plus Howard gets his chance to go back to his planet. Howard turned it down to be with the lady.
5,Howard the Duck Kicks!,"One of the greatest movies of the 80's and if not greatest most memorable. This is deffinantly a movie that should be released on DVD. Crazy movie about a large talking, beer gulping duck that goes to earth, get's the girl, and save's the world. He's from somewhere in space. THIS IS A MUST SEE!"
3,It's ok.,This movie is not that good. I kinda like the duck.It does not have a plot! I reccomend it to people who like silly movies.
4,Classic,A classic 80's sci-fi comedy. More for adults than for young children. One of those cult classic's.
4,Finally!!!!!,It's about time that Howard the Duck is being released on DVD. I haven't seen this movie since I was a child. I'm pre-ordering this movie right now.
1,worst comic translation ever,"this pathetic, insufferable piece of garbage defiled one of the most creative, original and brilliant comic books of all time -- steve gerber's seminal howard the duck. seek out the comics (ebay?), shun the ""film""."
5,It's a COMEDY people,"I loved this movie! Howard has a ton of funny lines and situations, my favorite being his run in with a no-nonsense welfare conselor, Cora-May. Lea Thompson is the perfect counter point to the farcial goings on and you'll never see her appear more lovely. Tim Robbins is surprisingly adept at comedy and the whole movie is a HOOT! I don't know what the problem is for these negative reviewers. Hey guys, get some bran cereal in your diet and try to enjoy life!"
4,Come on it's Howard the Duck,"Everyone gets too serious about reviewing movies. It's Howard the Duck. Which in general is probably yes a bad movie, but I love it because I remember watching it as a kid and thought the duck looked so real. Seriously lighten up about the whole thing, it's a bad movie but I still love it without questioning it. It's like Big Trouble in Little China."
1,This Duck Laid An Egg!,I have seen some cheesy movies that the critics hated that I actually liked and there are quite a few of the 80s corn movies that are cute and enjoyable but Howard The Duck isn't one of them and this time I totally agree with the critics that this movie is as bad as they say it is and if it ever does get to DVD I sure won't be buying it for my collection of cheesy movies! I prefer a cheesy movie that actually has a decent workable plot and actually has funny humor and isn't totally lame. Sorry but this movie about a beer swilling talking duck is just not funny!
3,Cleveland Quacks,"I don't get this film's notoriety. Methinks it's a case of Lucas envy on the part of it's critics. Nor did producer George Lucas have to take the extraordinary step of disowning it. Personally, I found it to be average summer fare, no worse than ""Men in Black II"" and as innocuous as ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"". The film's strongest moments come in it's first half and then kind of peters out with a series of elongated chase scenes and OK but nothing special FX. The only thing that gave me pause was the film's PG rating. There's a scene of Howard thumbing through ""Playduck"" and another where Lea Thompson discovers a condom in Howard's wallet. Otherwise, nothing to get your feathers in an uproar."
3,An enjoyable lightweight comedy,"Once you get past the fact that the producers tried to make Howard The Duck cute and loveable, this movie is actually an enjoyable lightweight comedy. Just sit back and enjoy the silliness.Of course, one of the things that made Howard The Duck such a great experience when it first came out was the opportunity to hear a Thomas Dolby soundtrack (he wrote & produced all the songs; John Barry did the orchestral score) at loud volume over a theater sound system..."
2,I Know Quack-Fu!,"At first recommended by a friend as one of the funniest movies he had ever seen, I went out on the hunt for a copy of the now-deleted 'Howard' and was lucky enough to finally purchase a copy last week. Why was I recommended this? How is it funny? Set back in the 80's, this dated tale of a cigar smoking, Booze ridden duck who is pulled out of his world (which publishes a magazine called 'Playduck') straight into the bed of Lea Thompson and has the cheek to be too embarrassed. Landing in Cleveland, Howard teams up with Thompson's Rock chick and crew and sets out to fight the evil Dark Overlord. To list this movies good points would be a task in itself, as its inept script, don't care attitude acting and cliché plot, it was no surprise that this little light was quickly blown out. A poor excuse at film-making in every angle, but the only problem is that its stupidly addictive to the end. Hence two stars instead of the dreaded one."
2,too much,"For a VHS copy of this movie, you cant actually charge $20 when its not worth more than $5. I also liked the movie, but never read the comic, Ive found this movie for .10 CENTS on ebay, and you have the audacity to sell it that high and rip people off. You can also get it from Hollywood video for $2.99. People that waste that much money are really dumb."
4,old movie,"got this movie for my husband, he had been wanting this movie. no dislikes about it. It is a funny movie."
1,Stinks like Rotten eggs!,"Peeeeew! This movie stinks, it was the worst movie I've ever seen and was absolute torture! Definitely can't recommended this stupid pile of junk!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS MOVIE--IT SUCKS,DID ANYONE REALLY PAY TO GO SEE THIS FILM IN 1986? OHMYGOD!!! PA-LEASE!! THIS MOVIE MAKES BEAVIS & BUTTHEAD DO AMERICA LOOK LIKE A BEST PICTURE.
1,Howard The Flop!,This movie sucks! And the reason why there isn't a sequel is because this was a box-office flop!
1,Why the heck did I watch this on HBO in the 80s.,"My how some of these 80s movies looks so god-awful in retrospect. Was this Duck World supposed to be a parallel universe to Earth's? Howard's world and everything that went on there closely, all too closely resembled Earth's and it's inhabitants.This movie is so lame and transparent. Why did I enjoy it in the 80s? Don't answer!"
1,costume + rocking out = box office poison,"Who got the idea that a man in a duck costume, rocking out with a guitar in front of screaming fans, was a ticket for success? At some level someone read this script and said ""what a great idea! Lets blow millions making this golden gem!"" It is the stupidest idea in the history of moviedom....proof of this is seen in the utter failure of the disney movie ""the country bears"" which also used the ""costume + rocking out in front of screaming fans"" formula. This movie is ""The Suck""....period."
3,Nice accessory to have if you need to re-charge often,"Useful device to charge my sony clie without the bulky cradle. The cable leading to the interface connector is a bit off-center because the other slot is for the USB cable (not included). This missing component is the USB Hotsync cable, available separately as the PEGA-HS10. I guess one needs to buy several accessories if you want both charge and hotsync while mobile.The other aspect I like about the portable charger is its capability to be plugged in to any voltage/frequency 100-240V, 50/60Hz.As I use my clie a lot, with the background light on, my battery does not last me through the long day. This is the reason I bought this portable charger."
5,My Life In The Pits,"I would recommend this book "" My Life in the Pits "" to any racing fans to get to understand the drivers more !"
5,I wish I could give this book more than five stars!,"I've been a huge fan of Catherine Spangler's since I devoured her first two books SHIELDER AND SHADOW CROSSING. I eagerly and anxiously look forward to each and every one of her fabulous futuristic romances. These books are simply brilliant! I only wish she would write faster! Of course, I read these books in one sitting.I had been waiting for Celie Cameron's story for ages and was so glad for it to finally have been written. She was paired up with the perfect hero in Rurik. This book couldn't have been more adventuresome! I know I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole book.Keep on bringing 'em on, Catherine Spangler! I'll be here to read and enjoy them!!"
5,Accessible and Convincing,"Searle approaches philosophy with unusual clarity and thoughtfulness. This book is a convincingly argued account for a philosophy of the mind that is both naturalist and respectful of subjective phenomenal experiences.The importance of this book's themes is only overshadowed by the extraordinarily lucid style with which Searle approaches his subject matter. By taking actual human experience as his starting point, Searle's argument gains force as well as meaning to less philosphically inclined readers. Searle has a knack for making complex issues in recent philosophy accessible to the less experienced reader while not losing any persuasiveness in conveying his argument.This book is a wonderful introduction to the philosophy of consciousness for anyone who has not done extensive work in the field and also a complex and intriguing argument that needs to be considered by the most serious philosophers."
3,The study of the mind is the study of consciousness.,"This book gives a good picture of the structure of the mind and of its irreducibility.It explains clearly what's the stumbling block of all scientific and philosophical problems with consciousness: the fact that the mind is only a subjective first-person experience.But the most interesting part, for me, was his convincing attack against cognitivismn (the theory that the brain is a computer and the mind a computer program).Nevertheless, I found his book 'The Mystery of Consciousness' more interesting, more profound and more specific, because it laid bare the accuracies / errors of other author's who wrote about the same important items."
2,state of analytic philosophy of mind at the end of century,"I sympathize with many of Searle's views about the inelliminability of the intentional character of consciousness, and the general misguidedness of philosophy of mind.. but I would ask: is this a big discovery? why read Searle rather than Husserl in the first place? Is his naturalism of any philosophical depth or interest? I would say no. I believe reading this book is a waste of time, as it was for me..."
4,No problem for older bottles,"It may be a little difficult for new beginner to use. After a while, you will enjoy the fun. It is especially good for open the older bottles, like 1960s."
5,THE BEST opener- period.,"I have looked ALL over for these, and am SOO thankful to have found the LAST one...these are the BEST quality ""ah so"" made. No cork damage, nor pieces floating in a bottle with this!!"
5,Cool 80's music,This vendor delivered quickly. By here and see my other reviews. This vendor is the best and delivers satiisfaction when others don't
2,Experienced multihull fan review,"This book is intended for people who know very little about sailing, and even less about multihulls.If you have sailing and multihull experience this book is not for you."
3,Reasonable book for ASA 114 class,Book focuses on comparison between Monohulls and Multihulls and does not appear to be as well written as other ASA publications. I would have liked more coverage of Cruising Catamarans and less on trailable multihulls.
5,Multihull Cruising Fundamentals,"Prompt, good quality and reasonable price.Book covers exactly what I wanted.Would recomment to others. Mix of pictures and descriptions."
1,Missing parts,I received this item and as a walked up to my back door I noticed box was open on top. I put the table together and was not surprized that parts were missing. I think the quality of this product is cheap for the price. I returned it via the mail in the condition I received it in.
1,Bocelli has no voice for opera,"Bocelli isn't a real Turiddu. His voice is powerless and he's not a great tenor. Marrocu is a wonderful Santuzza, so expressive, and very well done; she deserved a partner at her level."
2,Pass this one up if you are a Andre fan,"This is for you if you love opera. But if you are a Andre fan, pass it by. Why? Not much Andre and lots of opera"
5,Wow!,"Although much pricier than other dog steps I've researched, this product is worth every cent. It's a piece of furniture and one I'm not embarassed to have in my bedroom. It's a ramp or steps and folds flat for storage, comes fully assembled and ready for use and it even has a handle affixed to it for ease of carrying. It's sturdy and I don't worry about my poor old Cocoa using it to reach the bed. You won't regret this purchase."
4,Heavenly Touch,"*** no english sub-titles ***4 (****) stars. this would have been 5 stars if english sub-titles provided.excellent acting, with good directing throughout.marco morales gets better with each movie. paolo and joash did very well for it to be their 1st starring roles.it's nice to see a decently happy ending for our lovers for once."
1,What happened to ajax products?,"I have used ajax soap products for over 30 years,Recently I bought the lemon dish soap ,and the ajax ultra laundry soap and let me tell you both products were so watered down. had to use 3times more than ever before.This stuff is terrible now.I will never buy those products again.I would not advise buying those products,rip off."
3,Ahhh! Think I'll stick with my usual Dawn.,"I bought this when I needed some dish soap. It was on sale(cheap!), & my budget for that week was smaller than usual. Sure, I save a little money. But not really. It cleans the dishes ok, but I had to use a lot of it each washing. It didn't bubble up at all. Not that good on grease either. I had to was my greasy stuff 2 times.with the dawn I use less soap & only have to wash once. I think I'll stick to that no matter the cost."
3,Smells great.....,"I use this (lemon scented) Ajax dish soap occasionally and it is an ok product. It seems to clean dishes and remove grease but it doesn't suds like other dish washing soaps. I have to use alot of the product--even adding more soap after the water sits inthe sink, in order to get soap suds. In conclusion, if you wash dishes frequently I recommend trying a different product because it will save you money in the long run."
2,Mediocre Dish Soap,"I think I purchased this dish soap because I saved a few cents, assuming all dish soaps were more or less the same. This actually seems worse then the other name brands. Seems to run out of suds way faster. Not worth the miniscule amount of savings to have to wash dishes with this mediocre junk for months."
1,Waste of money,"I have used Ajax dish soap for a couple yrs now. I bought it cause you could get a large bottle at a great price.My daughter and daughter-in-law also used it. One day I was talking to them about it, they both switched to something different.I tried Palmolive and WOW what a difference. Just a dime size in my dishwater goes a long way. You can feel it in the water, unlike Ajax.Ajax is a watered down soap. You need to use a lot of it just to feel the soap in your dishwater. It mightclean well but for the price....try something different. You get what you pay for."
1,Disappointing,"I have used this for years, but now it is as runny as the ""brand x"" soaps. I will not purchase this any longer. I have to use 2 - 3 times as much as before."
5,Challenge your understanding,"This book will challenge your understanding of the role and value of e-commerce for small and medium-sized business as it generates as many new questions as it answers. I recommend this book as essential reading for anyone who really wants to learn how to help SMEs innovate with e-commerce, but without the hype!"
3,Wrong color,I love these envelopes but I received the cream color and not blue like what is shown on this page.
4,A better grasp on DIS,"I wanted to learn about DIS, and a friend reccomended this book to me. Even though I had very little background information on this subject, the author explained it in such a way that he did not cut out any information, but it could still be understood easily. The author goes into great detail about some of the more powerfull aspects of DIS, and with ideas that are a little harder to visualize the author provides helpfull illustrations, and diagrams.After reading this book, I went onto other writings about this subject, and found my self understanding what the text was talking about before it finished describing the concept. This is a great book to get into the world of DIS, or to Strengthen your existing knowledge of it."
3,Dated but hilarious graphics,"I picked up this book after enjoying the hilarious 90s-era illustrations in the book. I was doing some work that this book covered, and picked up a copy for cheap on Amazon."
2,Unbox + Tvio + Great!! No Remastered Trek - Blechh!,I've purchased several TV shows via my Tivo and Unbox. Never had any problems. Every episode was promptly downloaded to my Tivo.I naturally assumed that the episodes of TOS would be the remastered ones. I was very disappointed that Amazon was NOT offering them. I only found that out AFTER buying the episode and starting to watch it. Guess I should have come here first.I'm very disappointed in you Amazon.
3,Not as good as other Healthy Food sets,"I was disappointed in the quality of this set, when compared to the Healthy Dinner set which is excellent and very realistic. This one has more plastic pieces than vinyl ones and they are mostly flatly colored, so they don't look as real. The yogurt cup was damaged to boot, an real empty yogurt cup is better."
2,Warning: Very Dangerous Strawberries!!,"Fun toy, some of the food looks pretty real, and some just looks like a pile of goo. Cute little basket.But a BIG warning to all parents out there. The strawberries are wedge/pyramid shaped and sized *just* right so that a child can shove it into their mouth small point first, and it will get horribly stuck there with no way to take it out, potentially choking the child. DO NOT LET YOUR CHILD PLAY WITH THE STRAWBERRIES if they have a tendency to put things in their mouth.The rest of the toy isn't bad, so if you just throw away the strawberries, it's just fine and fun to play with."
5,Not loosing site of yester year,"My grandson watched the movie Sandlot. After that, it was all he talked about, how those PF Flyers made the Jet run so fast, and how he wanted some so he could run fast too!"
5,very comfy,I love this shoes. The first day was a little painful just due to the fact I have wide feet but after that they are very nice to wear.
5,Happy,We bought these for my son and he loves them. They are made well and he runs twice as fast and jumps twice as high.
5,"PF Flyers Center High top sneakers in ""Sandlot"" black, size 15","Bought these for my Converse-loving son, who says that the PF Flyers fit his wide feet MUCH better than chucks, and that the sole has more arch support and is therefore more comfortable than chucks, especially if you spend all day on your feet. He also said that they were comfortable right out of the box & needed no ""breaking in"" at all. And the all-black ""Sandlot"" version was very nice looking. Will defintely get another pair for my son, and maybe some for myself, too!"
3,contractor,I have other lights & they are more powerful & stand taller so the light isn't in your eyes. This light does not have spare bulbs in the frame.
1,"Relativity: The Special and the General Theory, The Masterpiece Science Edition","This book is just a re-print of the regular version with the same title- there is nothing special about it, so don't be fooled. Quite the contrary- it is horribly laid-out/edited and looks like someone never proof-read it for layout/format. It is even difficult to discern where each chapter (section) ends and the next begins (yes, it really is that bad). I haven't noticed any additional or different content in this book (despite what the title and description of the book elude to), when compared with the regular version.Einstein's original [translated] content in the book is in fact all there, and intact, and naturally quite good, but this edition of the book is just a poor quality reprint. If you are interested at all in this title/topic, simply buy the regular version, ""Relativity: The Special and the General Theory"". It is a proper version of Einstein's book."
2,Badly edited,So poorly edited (I is intended generally to be 1 in many equations) that the reader is distracted by typos. Not for the faint of heart.
2,From average to bad,"The Arrival is a good... television movie. Not terrific, but ""watchable"". The Arrival II is a bad movie. Visual effects are so bad ! And the story is quiet the same as the first one. In the special features, they reveal that The Arrival II had a very very small budget. We can believe it."
1,Very bad to see this movie!,I don't like this movie because the format of this pcture is not full screen and I have a 50'Plasma TV and it is horrible to see a movie like this...I would try to return you this movie because it's not fit for a HD TV.
1,Arrival - 3 stars...Arrival II - junk! NOT PG13~~ RATED R!,"...these two movies are distinctly different, and only Arrival I is PG13. Arrival II, however, is rated R and contains an unecessary and EXPLICIT SEX scene with full frontal nudity during and after. This had nothing to do with the movie plot and since it was already an enormous flop from the first one, only tended to degrade it worse. If these were separate movies, I'd keep one and trash the other. As it is, I'm stuck for having bought them as a dual dvd. Don't waste your money."
1,Stinker,"I saw this by accident on FiOS. What a stinker. Plot is awful. Characters thin. Effects cheesy. ""Sets"" phony. The very idea of buying this on Blu-ray is laughable. Sheen is a joke. He should stick to what he knows: one-line sex jokes, hookers and beating up his wives.This is a third world-produced ""film"" that should have gone straight to video that I'd perhaps buy used for $1 at a garage sale, and then throw away to save space. This makes Plan 9 From Outer Space look plausible.Man am I glad I saw it on a backwater channel and didn't put any money out on this turkey, even as a rental. There is no doubt why it failed at the box office. It would have failed at 2:00 AM on Syfy channel.If this is what passes for good sci-fi, y'all have a pretty low threshold for quality."
3,Good viewing,"Not the most inspirational DVD; however, it does have some fair acting, a decent ploy and a number of suspenseful moments. Worth the money for the entertainment value."
4,Crystal clear video,This is an entertaining science fiction movie with crystal clear video equal to that of The Fifth Element. I wish all DVD's had video that was this sharp.
3,Second rate sci-fi film,"I'm a fan of science fiction movies, to include alien movies. So, based on the average 4-star rating by the other Amazon reviewers, I watched this one.And I gotta say...kind of a waste of my time. The best part of the movie is the plot. But unfortunately the characters don't really infuse the film with much life. Charlie Sheen takes the lead role, and while humorous, just doesn't play a convincing paranoid astrophysicist. And the supporting cast doesn't do much for it either.Just a bland sci-fi movie that I really could have just skipped. I can't really even recommend renting it. If you want some 80's and 90s' sci-fi, go watch ""The Thing"", or any of the Alien or Predator movies, or ""ID4"" or even ""The Astronauts Wife"" for a better sci-fi experience."
4,A great plot!,"The Arrival is 1990's alien sci-fi at its best. I particularly enjoyed actors Charlie Sheen, Lindsay Crouse, and Ron Silver in this movie. The movie moved well, with generous portions of conspiracy theory and special effects thrown in. The ending was the best part and gives the viewer something to think about. As far as alien takeovers go, this movie presents an interesting dilemma; can mankind stop its self-destructive ways or face extinction by a more advanced race? It was certainly worth watching."
2,The Arrival,Did not like the storyline or acting. Seemed like a very low budget movie. Don't waste your money or time watching.
3,"Liked it, didn't love it","I watched it again to refresh my memory. I never loved it, but it was indeed an interesting angle on the alien invasion. How did they do it in the movie? As to make temperature high( for they can not survive cold), and overtake the Earth, for them we do not deserve it. They have a base with their technology deep underground and they are killing those who might find out about them(aka. team of scientists or 3 scientists). I didn't like the model of the aliens, nor that they are taking the full-body masks to walk among us. But it was okay to see how some of them may just look like and adapt to be among us just for a short time. In the movie, they basically hunt us and fast overtaking the Earth. How did they make it that far? And what was the support? Of course for humanity one of them must be a multi-millionaire. Interesting angle, but it lacks something that made me really enjoy it."
5,"Dave and Arrival dvds good, Four Feathers Very bad.","Amazon, you need to apply pressure to (dvdlegacy) for merchandisethat is not delivered.I was a happy custimer up till now.jcjgrega@embarqmail.com"
3,Arrival,"""Arrival"" has quite a bit going for it, but ""Arrival 2"" is a bit stretched. I would give ""Arrival"" at least 3 1/2 stars, but only 2 1/2 to ""Arrival 2"". The reason the first movie has so much going for it is the suspense, action, and acting. Good story with the trickling in of information that shows we aren't alone on our planet. Casting is good with Charlie Sheen, Lindsay Crouse, and Ron Silver. The story centers around Sheen tracking unusual data transmissions that lead him to a corporation that is carrying on operations that they don't want revealed at any cost, including murder. One of the things I respected about ""Arrival"" is the intelligence and cunning of the enemy. No blasting away and wiping things out, quite the contrary. If you enjoyed these be sure to catch ""Alienation"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". Good quality DVD with decent replayability."
1,only for arrival 2,"arrival was an inventive, cool movie worthy of 5 stars. however, arrival 2 is NOT. the nudity and ""intimate scenes"" *snicker* of that really unattractive woman were certainly unnecessary. what exactly was this movie about? where were the aliens with the scarey legs that were so great from the first movie? the only way they can sell this piece of garbage is to include it on a DVD with something else. do yourself a favour and just buy the arrival by itself."
3,t and a transistions to q and a,"the ""meat"" of the nude scenes have been altered..nice movie ..but doesnt have the zing to really move it along after being clipped ..so to speak...was at least five stars as wrapped ..."
2,Does not hold up well with time. Cheesy.,"I remember enjoying this movie during the theatrical run, but a recent viewing makes me think it is a rip off of 1997's Contact even though this came out a year earlier. Was there a battle over scripts or something? Contact is so much better in every way and I've watched it so many times it has become impossible to enjoy The Arrival."
1,Really Terrible Acting,There was not one redeeming feature in this movie. Everything aboout it was bad--including the use of time it took to watch it.
4,Good for a Charlie Sheen Movie,"Given that it was a Charlie Sheen starring movie I expected it to be a lot more dumber that it actually turned out to be. An original imaginative story which is not too ludicrous, somber acting by Charlie Sheen, good CG work all help to make this movie a very good package.A decent watch for sci-fi and alien movie addicts."
3,Gratuitous Fun,This is one of those lazy weekend movies when you want to have a little mindless diversion. The cute girl has sexual tension with a young Charlie Sheen and together they work in an anti-authority way to save the world. What more could you ask for?
4,"A forgotten ""B"" flick","It is unique and cool in its own way. I get bored easy in a lousy flick, but this one holds my interest. A cool and unique plot reminded me as lot of the XFiles (except there is not hot red headed actress!)."
1,Are other people reviewing the same movie?,"I love sci-fi. This movie doesn't fit the bill. It was just truly awful. Cult classic? Try cheesey, poor story and boring. By the end I couldn't have cared less what happened. This movie is on par with your typical syfy original movie."
3,Cheezy,"It's a b movie, not really great at anything. In fact I fell asleep. So, if you're into b movies this is it!"
3,They Have Arrived,"It's a good yarn. Sheen did a pretty good job. I was not overly excited by the story, though, or the acting."
3,Intriguing Beginning That Tends to Fizzle at the End,"This is an alien invasion plot which is more insidious than spectacular. Our hero, a radio astronomer who listens to the stars for alien life stumbles across an unmistakable signal. He finds it increasingly odd the deeper he investigates because the bureaucracy keeps shutting him down and discounting his findings. It becomes difficult to know who to trust because nothing turns out to be what it appears to be. He's finally forced to go it alone and presses on until he discovers the shocking truth. It woldn't surprise me if Al Gore didn't finance this film given its ultimate plot. Let's just say I had a hard time warming up to it."
3,The Arrival,This was a good sunday night family movie. It makes you thing that we may have visitors that we just don't know they are there.
4,Where did this movie come from? A real surprise!,I stumbled across The Arrival by pure accident and was prepared for a hokey stupid movie. What I found instead was a fairly good movie. Charlie Sheen pulled off his role very well. I think one of the best scenes has to be when Zane is sitting in a bathtub listening to his phone messages when all of a sudden the tub from upstairs comes crashing thru the ceiling. I enjoyed this film so much I went back and watched it again. I rated this movie **** stars. END
1,Those who gave it 4-5 stars must have been playing a practical joke?,"As there were lots of 4-5 star reviews, I thought this might be worth a try.All I can figure is that after wasting 2 hours on this movie, those who rated it high did so in the spirit of ""misery loves company"".This was just a HORRIBLE movie. Grade school acting, amateurish special effects, ridiculous plot, and a script that was disjointed.OK, so spoiler alert: Why did the aliens, who had this amazing terra-forming technology have to use scorpions to kill their enemies???Charlie Sheen is PATHETIC in the film - unless it was supposed to be a comedy, in which case he was BRILLIANT.It's two hours you'll want back. It's too late for me - but save yourselves before it is too late - not from the Aliens, but from the god-awful excuse for a movie!"
2,Just a mediocre sci-fi time killer,"I, as a Vangelis fan, bought it simply due to some name confusion (The Arrival + Vangelis = completely not relevant CD) and MAINLY the 4 star review at amazon. After watching it I realized this is really just a TV-scale sci-fi movie. Low cost production with one-actor show. The story was barely interesting but the acting, special effect, and script were just mediocre, not really to the standard of big screen.Some claims this is a movie that should receive better review than Independence Day. Not so at all in my opinion. Not even compare with the special effect, just by the ""effort"" put in the movie and the acting alone, ID was way better than this movie. I found Sheen's acting was exaggerating and less convincing.Since I was lured to buy it due to the review, I would just like to provide another data point to help people make better decision than I did. :("
1,Caveat Cogitor,"So the aliens have videotapes in their outdoor security cameras, instead of inside a building.So the aliens have such poor security that anybody can stroll into and out of their ""secret"" facilities.So the aliens disclose their plans in front of a camera.So aliens freeze solid when sprayed with a little liquid nitrogen.So Sheen took up about 90% of the screen time.So the special effects were dated even when the movie was released.So the aliens have knees the bend the other way.So what!I long for the verisimilitude of Buck Rogers."
4,$8.00 or $13.00,Why would you pay $13.00 for arrival 1 when you could pay $8.00 for arrival 1 and the piece of junk arrival 2 ??????????So don't watch the piece of junk !!!!!
3,The Arrival,First of two movies on the subject. I have spent much time studying this subject from a more scientific level and can say by reading between the lines there is much mythos icons here. But you will have to dig for them. If that study motivates you the movie rates a 4. If it is entertainment you want it is a 2.
5,Great movie!,"I'd like to thank those who took time to writereviews for this flick; they were so positivethat I took the chance and was well rewarded.This movie is just a 'sleeper', pure and simple.The same thing happened with that other David Twohyclassic, Pitch Black. Twohy knows his stuff, knowshow to make a really really solid sci-fi movie.There are great special effects here (mostly towardsthe end), but this little gem has such good character development,fine acting, pace etc., thatspecial effects (which I love when well done) aren'timportant to the success of this film. I'll put it thisway: there is a sea of Sci-Fi out there- I'll takemore of this!At the very least rent this and see for yourself."
2,stupid,"Bad acting, dumb story not worth you time or engery...Bad acting, dumb story not worth you time or engery... not even a B movie"
3,Interesting plot,"Not Charlie Sheen typical macho role. Interesting plot, but a little far fetched. No one in the entire world suspects anything but Zane, Sheen's character, of alien activities. Does have an unexpected twist at the very end you don't see coming."
3,The Arrival and Arrival II DVD,"The original Arrival was entertaining (it's a long winter here in the Midwest.....) for a science fiction lover. The plot is not developed deeply, but the viewer can get the drift. Arrival II is a lost cause, but did afford some laughs for poor acting and no plot. as it came free with the first movie, am not complaining."
5,I love weird movies,I had seen this movie only once on TV and it was so goodI had to get a copy. Had to have both one & two..Charlie playes a great part too.Anytime i see a good ailen movie with strangebeings that I want..
2,classic B movie,"Good storyline, not great acting. Kind of predictable. Saw movie many years ago. Was worth second look. Was not Charlie Sheens best movie."
2,Sneaky Aliens Attempt To Take Over Earth,"This movie could very well be an episode of Star Trek that never got produced. Hey, if you are 14 and have nothing else better to do, just press play."
5,The Arrival is a top rated thriller,"Movie really is worth watching, don't miss the Arrival 2. The special effects are really great . The aliens are very unique and original"
3,Arrival,This was a fun and action filled movie. Charlie is young. This is not an award winning movie but is still fun.
4,Not bad...,"Having seen the mess that Charlie Sheen is today, I wasn't expecting much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised. The story has an overtone of Global Warming politics, but even with that, it is still an entertaining tale of one man's journey to prove his work, and finding a conspiracy to hide it."
3,The movie will not play.,"I seen this movie before and it's pretty good. However, it will stop after the first 10 minutes when play on Roku or Sony blu-ray."
4,Entertaining cautionary tale,"A well crafted early ecological metaphor, with a sane script and a believable terraforming premise. Sheen at his hyper-paranoiac best."
3,"So, so picture","Charlie is neurotic enough for the part, but difficult to empathize with. Plot is nothing new. Altogether, a real yawner."
2,A bad film,"there's not too much to say on this film, except bad acting by virtually everyone, an uninspired score, cheesy effects and mundane dialogue. if you want a really believable alien film, try ""monster"" which is currently on amazon instant."
1,The Train,"I cannot play this dvd on my dvd player. It is not formatted for the USA. When I purchased it , it gave me no warning that I could not use it on my player! I cannot send it back because it would cost more for postage than the price of the dvd!"
3,"Great for WWII buffs, but it didn't do much for me.","John Frankenheimer directed this semi-grim WWII action film, with Burt Lancaster as a one-man army out to stop the Nazis from plundering all of France's greatest modern art treasures. Frankly, it's not the greatest script, but there is some flashy, impressive B&W cinematography, and an interesting cameo by oafish French character actor Michel Simon (who was the star of Jean Vigo's 1934 masterpiece, ""L'Atlante."") This film's epic scope and technical razzle-dazzle both feel a bit mechanical -- one could imagine Joel Schumacher or Brian DePalma directing it, if they'd been active in the 1960s. Nevertheless, WWII buffs and train enthusiasts will dig it. I thought it was okay, but there are plenty of war films that are much better. (Axton)"
3,Very detailed and suspenseful ww2 film.,"Based around the French railway men and how they managed to derail NAZI efforts to smuggle french art treasures out of the country before the allied advance. It really is a good movie, don't let the first 5 minutes or so throw you for a loop, it just sets up the main 'evil nazi guy's ' madness."
3,"""Mancaster""","Great old time WW11 movie. Good action, decent special effects. This Black and white tells an interesting story (True?)of Paintings being smuggled out of France to Germany by German officer with good taste. Some really excellent preformances by old school French/ euro actors. Lancaster is Young and Studly, and quite nimble. American Accent, well doesn't work. Don't get too deep with this one. This movie is well made however and has real grit to it as people die and are roughed up good. Fun little film at a good price."
4,A story that needed to be told.,This is a great movie that tells about saving the great art of the world that was stolen by the Nazis during WWII. This little known story is thrillingly told in this film. Well acted by Burt Lancaster and the rest of the cast. The cinematography is excellent with great action. This is one movie I'm glad I bought.
5,"I have not seen this video, but...","I have not seen the video version of this excellent movie, however, I saw this movie when it was out in the theaters (dating myself somewhat). It is one of my all time favorites and I am glad to discover that it is out in video. I looked for it many times in rental stores with no luck. If you like Burt Lancaster, you love this movie. If you like WWII movies, you love this movie. If you like trains, you love this movie. I am about to buy myself a copy right now."
4,One of Burt's Best,"I saw this year's ago as a small kid but never truly appreciated it until I bought it and saw it as an adult. A gritty story about the resolve of the French resistance during the end of World War II. If you love trains, you will enjoy seeing these classic trains brought back to life. Burt doesn't come off as being very ""french"" in this movie but it is still an excellent story."
5,Burt Lancaster in the Train,A great movie -- I've watched it on TV several times and finally broke down and bought it. One of the best WWII movies.
3,puttin on the ritz is a good one,I like the whole cd. I wanted the song with the words but sounded good though and it also has a few other songs that I know and I was surprised they were on there. So I gave it 3 big stars.
1,Ninja Gaiden Wannabe,"Terrible movie, those who gave this movie a good review need to get out more or rent ong bak 1 or 2 and find out what a real martial arts movie is supposed to look like."
3,not bad,"it was a good movie and the action scences were great, but the story could have used more work."
4,Low Budget... Highly enjoyable,"ALthough low budget... and not fantastic acting... I still enjoyed this movie a lot. I purchased it and have no plans on trading it in. Had some better moments than Ninja Assassin and some good flashbacks, etc. At this current price of 7.99, its a steal."
3,NINJA,"Ninja [Blu-ray]A good action flick although in the ""B"" category, the special effects were good but the acting was so-so and the story line was predictable. All in all though I enjoyed it as a martial arts film. It was released at about the same time as Ninja Assain (which if put side by side was by far the better film)."
3,Talent not fully utilized,"I've seen Scott Adkins in other things and his stunts on youtube and in this movie we see so little fighting and stunts its a shame.The plot is typical but well told. Not too trite or mundane. White guy is an orphan and gets favor of sensei over the Japanese guy who becomes enraged with jealousy and then defects. Was pleasantly surprised that the japanese girl actually tried to fight and hold her own, unlike american women in movies who just scream and get in the way of the hero. and she was good so it was cool.The fighting scenes were few and far between. Lots of blood but not excessive like ninja assassin. I'm really just upset that there were few actual martial arts scenes. It wasnt a bad movie though. But, even though I own it on bluray, I prolly wont watch it again."
2,Not worth my time,"This movie was mistakenly purchased in place of NINJA ASSASSIN. This movie, despite the poor ratings, is still really bad. Very dumb. It started off mediocre and despite my hope and expectation, just got worse. Just too stupid for words--and with the exception of a couple of actors, very bad acting. Some good fight scenes, but nothing holds this story together--and did I mention, it was really dumb! Don't waste your time."
1,They bothered to make a DVD for this movie?,"I've watched my fair share of horribly acted, bad movies. But in all honesty I'd rather watch some of the 70's and 80's kung-fu flicks than toss this DVD in the player. I rented the movie and watched it then couldn't drive fast enough back to the store to return the blasted thing.It's a bad movie, with bad actors, and a bad story. About the only good thing is the name and cover art."
2,Waste of time,Well not much to say. I rented this at Redbox for a buck.. Waste of a dollar. I mean since when does a Ninja use a gun? That was pretty much a deal breaker for me. No Story at all. Stupid men in cult robes that never have a meaning. Bad acting. Fight scenes are Ok. More karate than Ninja. Pass on this one until its on TV for free.
1,Where is an actual ninja movie?,"Honestly... This movie as well as ninja assassin... is Terrible. Neither depicts the actual ninja. Just bullshit. This is a movie with terrible acting as all other negative comment says. However, they say ""Ninja assassin"" Is a better movie. Ninja assassin has better acting and better visuals. BUT NEITHER DEPICTS AN ACTUAL SHINOBI! They were men of stealth, sabotage, and concealment. All this bullshit about them being Killing machines get far to much attention from fools. I am american, But I am fascinated with the actual ninja. I am sick of this Bull shit where they put an english speaking person in a ninja scene. It is old, and should be dead. I want a ninja Movie that is historically acurate. One that isnt just a ""Ninja"" Cutting his way through a truck load of people then getting the girl. Its Stupid. A Stealth based ninja movie would be nice for a change."
2,"Ignore the cover, its deceiving","I am not one of those critics that nit picks movies on menial stuff, but this movie sucked. I was very disappointed because the cover deceives you into thinking this guys is going to be awesome like snake eyes or something. Wrong! and the female just ticked me off, they should have just trained her to make tea if they were going to let her get beat up so much, depite going to the SAME martial arts school as her buddy. The chick still ends up being the typical damsel in distress. Do they have some decent stunts yes? But there are beter movies to waste your three dollars on. So I beg of you don't waste your time and please don't waste your money. You can't get either back. Not if you want a real movie watch IPMAN 1! Now that guy is the sickest martial artist I have seen yet!"
1,Expected ALOT more!,"I am a big fan of Scott Adkins ever since I saw Undisputed 2 and 3 and I really expected a whole lot more from him and Isaac Florentine in this movie since both Undisputed movies were so badass! But this movie was sooooooo lame. The acting was terrible. The effects were terrible. The plot was stupid. And the little details were just dumb. Alot of the other bad reviews pretty much covers in detail as to why this movie sucks but man Isaac should've used Scott's talent in martial arts a WHOLE lot more than the POS fight scenes he was in. They were your basic jump, kick and bad guy falls down in agonizing pain. C'mon! And plus Scott's character was lame. That did no justice for him as an actor or a martial arts expert."
1,What is the point?,"I can't believe how dissapointed i am with this movie. With one or two good parts the rest of the movie is crap. The bad guy is the only cool character, and i use cool very very spareingly. What is the point of a ninja movie where the main character gets his butt handed to him through the entire movie!!!!! You can't even call him a ninja because he dosen't do anything stealthly. Just martial arts and he gets his butt kicked over and Over and over and over and over....... It is pathetic. Even at the end when the hero is supposed to be amazing and super strong, fast, skilled, etc. He still gets his butt kicked. I should have listened to the negative reviews and not wasted my money. God i hate myself for buying this."
2,Horrible Movie,Horrible movie bad acting the only thing that was good about this movie was the bad Ninja's modernised armored and hi tech ninja suit
1,Time I will never get back,This movie was down right just HORRIBLE!!! It was sooo bad I had to forward through all the bad acting and dialogue just to get to the so-so action sequences I love a good ninja flick but this was not it.
1,A far inferior ninja movie,"I made the mistake of watching 'Ninja Assassin' first and saw one of the most complete and best ninja movies ever. After watching 'Ninja,' I was supremely disappointed w/every facet of the movie: the so-called acting is atrocious, the story is pathetic and very lackluster and the best thing to do w/this movie, is to avoid it at all costs. Save your money and save your time, then watch the far superior 'Ninja Assassin.'"
2,laughable and not in a good way,"I rented this before buying it because I noticed it got really low reviews. I was trying not to laugh while watching this because it was really ridiculous. The ninja costumes were great and some of the fight scenes were cool but the story and acting were really bad. Plus at times felt like a live TV broadcast. I guess they didn't have time or budget to use better filters in post production. Overall, it was like watching a live action 80's cartoon with way over the top stories and villains. I loved those 80's cartoons and the ninja movies of that decade, and this film seemed help me live some of those memories. But overall it was really hurried and poorly done. I found it hard to make use of my ""suspension of disbelief"". I wouldn't buy it for $15 but it's good to rent for the giggles. Ninja Assassin was much better movie. Better story, acting, and action."
3,Worth your time :) It Delivers!,"I am a huge Martial Arts fan so for me going into any ""NINJA"" film you have to expect that the plot will be the same, the acting will be the same and hope for good fight scenes. This film delivers! Awesome fight scenes and choreography were shot very well. I was very impressed with the action overall. Hey, it is a ""NINJA"" film so it does not have to be realistic which is what is great about these films. Kind of reminded me of The Perfect Weapon combined with Revenge of the Ninja. Definitely worth checking out and perhaps purchasing as it is very inexpensive."
4,A great read for bedtime,This book is fun to read and has great sounds for the kids to make and repeat! The language flows in a methodical manner that creates a sleepiness. Put in on the nightstand under good night moon!
5,Beautifully written bedtime story,"This is a wonderfully imaginative and calm book which makes it perfect for bedtime, yet is interesting enough to hold their attention. It's characters are realistic enough for a child to relate to. It's illustrations are simple, uncluttered and support the tone of the storyline. A book to keep for years for children of all ages to enjoy."
5,A valuable resource for creative job seekers,"This is an excellent book. The author has done a great job in pulling together the elements which spell success in the quest for employment. I recommend it.Wayne D. Ford, Ph.D., author of ""The Accelerated Job Search"" docwifford@msn.com"
2,Costly paperback!,Its hard to believe someone would choose this book over one by a similiar name for much less money.
1,"Such a cute book, but the STINK just isn't there!","I ordered this book for my daughter and returned it right away--I think these ""Bug"" books are so cute, and we have several, but the scratch and sniff stickers were totally odorless. It was a real disappointment. In general though, this series has got some really creative themes, and the bugs are all so darling and clever! I'd recommend any from this author, but be forewarned about the poor quality of the scratch and sniff stickers in this one."
2,Stinks-they disappear overnight!,After gently scratching and reading this the first time the scents disappeared. Though my 2 yr old still likes the book. The purpose of spending the $ was to introduce smells which there aren't any. Don't waste your $.
3,Watch out for the dirty sock bug!,"I agree with all of the other reviewers who say that the smells wear out fast. After a week I could not longer detect any of the good smells such as bannnana, chocolate, or popcorn. However my daughter does not seem to care. She LOVES this book. Actually she loves all of the bug books with a passion. I don't really understand it myself but they make her happy so that is good enough for me. Unfortunatly the one smell that still lasts is the dirty sock bug on the last page of the book. It cracks her up to make us smell it and if we won't she chases us around the room with it. Yes I am dissapointed that the smells no longer work but my three year old daughter still gets a kick out of the book so I guess that's what matters."
3,Mediocre and limited utility,"I tried this solution,as recommended on our Bichon Frise. It reduced the stains but did not eliminate them. Our pet suffered no ill effects.It barely worked and was only 40-50% effective.It may be worth a try but it didn't work for my dog."
5,not burnt,"Ordered this coffee and was quite pleased with it. For those who are used to (and, possibly enamored of) the world of Starbuck's burnt coffee, Reggie's Blue Mountain will come as a surprise. It's not over roasted, it has wonderful depth and complexity, and is an all around solid coffee.This is why I like coffee, not that other burnt stuff. Recommended for everyone."
3,"Not bad, just not worth the price","This coffee produces an extremely mild brew. What you can taste is pretty good, but so faint; it's one step above hot water. Given the price, we won't be ordering again."
2,A Disappointment for the Price,"I knew this was not going to be as good as real Blue Mountain coffee one can have in Jamaica, but I still had high expectations. This coffee fell short by quite a bit. The aroma was reasonably good, but the taste was just mediocre. Not nearly as good as 100% Kona. I am not saying it's bad, just it's not worth this price to me."
2,"Was OK, but have definitely tasted better...","The delivery was quick, so that's a plus, but I was dissapointed with the coffee itself. Like other reviewers here, I had my first cup of Blue Mountain coffee in Jamaica, and it was amazing, so I had pretty high expectations. This coffee was just too dry and bland for my taste. The coffee shop where I used to get my coffee in Chicago, My Soul Cafe, recently started selling their blue mountain coffee online, so I will never purchase Reggie's again. There is definitely better stuff out there, and probably at a better price."
1,Dry as a Bone,"Drinking Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee in Jamaica is a treat - it's fantastic coffee. Unfortunately, the stuff you get from Reggie's Roast must date back to the Paleolithic Era. Good luck finding oils on these beans. There were hints of the Jamaican ""magic"", but the beans were just too old. Better to buy local, I guess..."
4,Reggies for Reggie,"I gave some to a guy called Reggie and he loved it! Maybe it was just the name. It's an OK blend. Not the best I have had, but taste is avery personal thing. Still, enjoyable nonetheless!"
3,"Fascinating ideas, tough reading","This book has some amazing concepts about scientifically designing sustainable structures to support humanity.Be warned, the writing style is hard to read, with lots of hypenation and big words. However, the underlying concepts are extremely simple.This book opened my eyes to the possibility that science can be applied to create high living standards for everyone."
2,"Good thoughts, poorly written","This book was a struggle to read and enjoy. The author, though he has decent ideas (albeit very outdated), takes so many tangents, his point is never clearly made. It's like listening to Grandpa rant on about everything and nothing. I consider myself a very logical ""scientifically minded"" person. Much of Fuller's ideas of history of humanity are logically thought out based on his understanding and experience although it is not all necessarily based on sufficient scientific/ archeological evidence. So it's difficult to differentiate between which is credible mainstream theory and personal philosophical thoughts. I think the book has some wonderful ideas that apply especially to today's society. It's just a shame that the book was written so poorly and the train of thought was poorly organized. By the way, the Dymaxiom house is a horrible, unsustainable invention. That's why only a couple were built."
5,THE twenty-first century survival manual,"I first stumbled across this title in the small booklet of a Sting CD, if you can believe that (don't forget Sting was a high school English teacher before his ""white reggae"" stardom.) This is THE twenty-first century survival manual if you ask me. It has everything: green politics, scientific method, soul mechanics, management poetry, global strategies, new age without the sewage, ""righteous"" criticism, fraternity, and enough flint to provoke a four-alarm fire in your nascent conscience, with an emphasis on the science. A crunchy read.(Part of my ""starter's kit"" along with everything ever written by C. Wright Mills, Alvin Toffler, Fritjof Capra, Noam Chomsky, Joseph Campbell, John Kenneth Galbraith, Gaston Bachelard, Abraham Maslow, Michel Foucault, and Bertrand Russell)"
4,keep an open mind,"While reading this book I felt that it was possible that the form of the book and the ideas within were at odds. I almost wish Fuller might have reinvented the Book to somehow suit this thought process and logic which seem to work best if mapped out in a less linear manner- more geodesic if you will.This book will cause you to question nearly every aspect of the world as you know it, from economics to geology. In fact, you might even gain an appreciation of just how important one is to the other. You may even find yourself in awe of a man with a scope of history (and the future) rivaling that of Marx."
1,Poor Craftsmanship,"Just purchased this for my parakeet, went to put it together and what junk. None of the poles lined up and I had to drill holes for them to fit and the wood was bowed. I was going to send it back but once I started drilling holes I just finished. I would not recommend this item to anyone."
4,small but works,Play area seems kinda cheap but the price was right. The swing rubs the side of the pole. My quaker parrot enjoys standing on the top of it though. Ladder is easy for him to climb.
4,Very useful before or after first Ring experience,"Professor Cord's book proved very useful to me when I attended the Ring cycle at the S.F. Opera in June 1999. I had watched the N.Y. Met video tapes, and read up on the four operas, but Cord's book gives extensive background information to help you understand the context in which the operas were created and first performed. The S.F. Opera was selling this handbook to its patrons and it turned out Professor Cord was sitting two rows ahead of us. His enthusiasm, love, respect and knowledge of Wagner are clear.You can read the book before attending or, if your prefer, after the experience to clarify questions and insights you have had. I recommend it as a wonderful starting point for anyone exploring Wagner's Ring."
3,"good book,but lacked knowlage and enthusiasim of Wagner",I am a true Wagnarian. Der Gotterdammerung is my favorute opera. The Rhine Madiens in this book where not described acuretly.
4,A pretty promising start for a true talent in jazz.,"This is a good album. Tia was much younger then and it shows that she has room to grow but this is still a good album. The sound of the band is pretty coherent but the vocals hurt the album and take away from otherwise good performances by the band. Otherwise, this is a very good debut album and it carries the promise of bringing young blood, energy and perspective to the jazz sound. Tia Fuller brings a fresh voice to a jazz world that needs it."
2,misleading and irresponsible,"beautiful pics,however the native information is misleading and borders on the irresponsible...95% of the plants used in the "" traditional Mayan"" remedies are not native to this continent and were brought over by Latins...how can it be Mayan if they are not using Mayan plants? One bath calls for Rue, marigold, motherwort,basil,and St. Johns Wort..all Mediterranean plants. They also tell folks to look for a native sweatlodge on the INTERNET!!How dumb can you be?..that is very dangerous and people have died doing that before. Good book for new agers that don't care about authenticity in ceremony. signed, ""NDN Sobadora"""
5,Hot Fun for the Summer Time!,"""Let It Be Me"" by Libbie Richman is a romatic, sexy adventure to read. The book features Lisa Klein's conflict regarding a fling with her romantic ideal, singer Yale Frye and her loyal husband Ronnie. Lisa's emotions, passion and spirit make the book an exciting read.Libbie Richman brings life to a host of characters and breathes life into the genre of adult novels. Share this book with your wife or girlfriend. They'll be moved by the romance and adventure and the passion inside."
4,Dozens of Fantastic Goals,"This DVD is a great summation of the 2006 World Cup. It includes all the goals, but almost nothing else.One of the biggest attractions of this DVD for me is hearing proper commentary by informed, skilled individuals which is far superior to the commentary we had to listen to in the U.S. during the televised matches. The other strong point is the many angles from which each goals is shown. The DVD also includes the 10 best goals and the 10 best saves.The only weakness is that group play is a single chapter: You have to fast-forward to get to another group's goals. I was also concerned with getting my money's worth (given the relatively high price of the DVD), but I ended up watching it several times in the first couple of weeks.Strongly recommended."
4,Only in small doses,This video is best taken in small doses. The goals and shots are excellent but they all start to fade together.
1,This move is really judgment day,For Ice T and Mario Van Pepples that is. Two of the worst actor to ever grace the screen star in a movie together and whatz worst hollywood is still givin this cats money to make more films what the f--- are they thinkin. If you want to rent a movie with a fine woman(Shireen Crutchfield) rent this movie if you want a good movie rent something else. Mos def!
3,"Excellent plot, low budget?","Judgement Day is similar to Armageddon and Deep Impact, which came out around the same time in 1998-1999. But if I had to choose the best PLOT of any of the ""big rock hits earth"" movies, it would be Judgement Day. However, there are a few actors who just do not fit the roles they are cast in. Yet the three primary actors are Ice-T, Suzi Amis, and Mario Van Peebles. Their roles are solid and convincing.There are about fifty dollars worth of special effects in the movie and, being a ""big rock in space, hits earth"" movie, that should tell you something.If you get this, do so for the story. The plot (with minor development) is by far excellent compared to any of the other movies of this genre."
1,What this movie is missing is Ice-T and Coolio in space......,"Ice-T (Mean Guns, New Jack City) is released from being a convict by female cop Suzy Amis (Firestorm) because religious gospel talking Mario Van Peebles (Baadasssss!, The Hebrew Hammer) has in his capture a scientist, played by Linden Ashby (Mortal Kombat) who can stop a astroied from wiping the planet out. All that's missing is Ice-T and Coolio in space, that would be cool. Seeing them in space, trying to stop the astroid...that would be cool. No, nothing of the sort in this thriller which just doesnt thrill, it gives off bad acting and kills Coolio (Batman & Robin) off in his cameo. Suzy Amis doesnt even look like's she trying, Ice-T is himself and Peebles doesnt even give off enough juice in his role though he has some moments. Also starring Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister Jr (The Fifth Element, Friday movies). Suffers from being just too boring."
2,SUZY AMIS-PLEASE STOP ACTING,"okay. Just caught this on TV1 tonight. First off, there is some above average script writing for a low budget film, and the gun effects are nice as well. Some of the characters are interesting, but the plot is a bit hokey (gangstas and asteroids?), and Suzy Amis appears to be recovering from a hang over. Totally uninspired performance, her lines are delivered as if she were rehearsing rather than actually ""acting"". Better casting and better direction needed. The Coolio death scene is about as uninspired as has ever been put on film. I kept yelling at the screen ""Hey, Mister Director, were's the passion!"". In fact, this film's biggest flaw is the flaw most grade B films have: A director who does not force his actors to display a sense of urgency. When Suzy is told the world is going to end, her reaction is similar to being told you forgot your change at the convenience store. ACTING!!!"
3,Judgement Day,"This review is for the 1999 version with Ice T and Mario Van Peebles. A religious fanatic, played by Peebles, thinks killing and kidnapping is okay. He kidnaps a scientist that could save the Earth from being hit by a meteor. He believes God has willed man to be eradicated so he doesn't want the scientist to prevent it. Fortunately for us Ice T is being released from prison just to take him out. Good B actioner for a slow Sunday. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catchChain of Command.CA Luster"
5,Great commentary for my collection,This is a well written commentary with lots of insights and study tools. This is a must for the student of the Word. I am never disappointed in any of John MacArthur's works.
5,Happy customer,I was very pleased with the book and I received it in a timely manner. I will order again
3,Tricks of the Trade [VHS],This was an interesting movie with Cindy Willams. Was it a great movie? No. Still it was interesting to see what movies she did do long ago.
1,Don't waste your time with this book!!!!,"Save your money, unless you don't know that you can still make trades before and after the normal, 9:30 am to 4:00 pm, stock market hours of operation.This book in my opinion doesn't do much other than to explain, you can trade after hours if you choose a broker that allows you access to the ECN's which operate longer hours then the normal market times. They fill the rest of the book with explanations of charting, and other technical analysis, and there are many other books that do that much better. I found nothing on techniques of trading after hours, which this book implies will make easy.I would sell this book used, but my ethics prevent me from hoisting this on you."
4,I love Her Stuff!!,"My favorite though is the Beauty and the Opera, just FYI that story is also availibla in the Modern Classics of Fantay Collection and it is less expensive there."
2,Stagestruck...,"From the macabre to the lightly horrific, this anthology has something for almost anyone. The stories delve into the past and then shoot to the future. A psychiatrist whose aim is to change her clients finds herself the one changed. The last survivors of earth's desolation depend on the mercy of aliens, and a young girl finds within herself the power to avenge the wrongs done by those who torment her. One story in particular stands out as especially haunting- the opening story, Beauty and the Opera or the Phantom Beast; as you might guess, it deals with the Phantom of the Opera- leaning more towards what the internet would term Christine - Erik shippers- but be warned- it's not all roses. That story, if no other, makes this a book worth reading."
5,The Dore Lectures on Mental Science,"Anyone familiar with Thomas Troward has probably read The Edingurgh Lectures. If not, that would be a good starting point, followed by The Dore Lectures. If you want to get a thorough picture of what mental science is about, please take the time to read these two volumns. Be patient and read carefully, as he was writing a century ago and may seem a bit more poetic than today's writingsThe Edinburgh and Dore Lectures on Mental Science. Once you get accustomed to his writing style, these books are quite enjoyable and well laid out. Open your mind and you will learn much. Happy reading!"
4,Much Easier,"I'm not getting any younger, so working on extended length caulking projects with a manual caulking gun was becoming a little too difficult. Enter the Milwaukee 6562. I've only used it once, but I went through five tubes of caulk on my driveway and pool deck and the only fatigue I felt was in my legs. The size of the caulk bead can be adjusted very precisely. The battery was not challenged by my project, so I don't know exactly how long it would last. I deducted one star because I found it difficult (or more accurately ""awkward"") trying to stop a small amount of caulk from dispensing after I'd released the trigger."
2,The end of the story,"Bob Matherson succumbed to cancer early in 2008. He spent his last days in Key West where he lived from about 2000. He opened the Oak Beach Inn Key West in big house on the corner of Duval and Caroline Streets, with a very large open-air restaurant and bar. The immediately previous tenant was a Hooters.The OBI-KW was fitted out with much of the nautical memorabilia transported from Long Island when the last OBI there closed. The new OBI only lasted for about a year. The owners of the property gave Matherson assurances that would be able to use part of the large house as employee housing, but City officials denied him that right.He had another manuscript that picked up where ""Scandal"" left off but it probably died with him. I sat with Bob on a couple of afternoons when he was unable to get up from the couch where he laid due to pain and pain killers. He was bitter at the end, frustrated that he was never able to get satisfaction from those he felt had screwed him over."
1,"only one word comes to mind ""AWFUL""!!!!!","George ,how can you have your name attached to this drivel .I'm sorry but the writing style is in no-way yours , can`t be , it `s terrible have read most of your books over the years , and have waited for your new works to arrive in anticipation of a fantastic read . SHAME ,SHAME, GEORGE!!!. Who is this Rousseau person?, been unable to find any other works bearing her hand, and, obvious lacking literary talent . Please George , return to your solo works and leave the collaborations with no-name hacks to others . sincerely , Loyal reader."
2,"Well writen ""Bravo"" MS Rousseau .","I found the book a decent read ,although every other chapter was an account of one mans egotistacal dilemma, the fantastic writing style of the authur Ms. Rousseau , kept it flowing, and made this Huge ""EGO"" filled ""TIRADE"" highy readable. Again ""Bravo"" to the authur ... ps. Dosn`t allow for writing style via the star rating system ,which i would have to give the author 6 stars.."
3,Still Left Holding,"After reading your book, I was very disappointed that you didn't finish your story.To date you are now in Key West, FL. Working and growing up on Long Island at the time of your reign, I found your book very interesting with a lot of flashbacks for myself. I followed most of your events as they unfolded.I would like to know your outcome after the book finished...Bottom line, did you WIN???? Or just take the money you made in your adventures.Sincerely, Bartender of the Time"
5,A True Original,Director Paul Schrader's sumptuous and operatic telling of writer Yukio Mishima's life and stories rivals all films released in the past ten years for filmmaking originality and daring. Critics scream for something different and this film was totally ignored! Go figure. Discover it for yourself and you will marvel at the cinematography by John Bailey highlighted by the music of Phillip Glass. This film deserves more than just a cult following.
4,Subarashi! Wonderful!,"Outstanding! However, I am a Mishima groupie -- I've read most of his novels and biography. I expected some documentary footage of which there is none. If you love Mishima for his introspection and have no political agenda, this is a wonderful movie. It's very well put together for a former Grand Rapidsite (and any American for that matter). Mishima was a marvelous and complex individual who has some great tales to tell unbeknowest to the average Western person."
3,brief comments about the merits of the DVD release,"Yes, the narration has changed and is about as lively as Leonard Cohen on valium, and if anyone knows why they got rid of the original I'd be glad to hear it.However, I think there are a couple of good reasons to get this DVD. First, it is a widescreen transfer. Second, there is the commentary by Paul Schrader (and director's commentaries are always a welcome feature). Lastly, there is the Japanese language narration for which I believe the DVD is the first available format.If you don't like the English language narration, maybe you could watch it in Japanese with the subtitles? Just a suggestion--although the Japanese narrator (is it Ogata Ken?) is similarly detached, which I suppose was a stylistic decision."
3,GRAET COMEBACK ALBUM...BUT SOUNDS LIKE....,"This is a great way for a comeback and all! Good lyrics and the beats are da bomb! Very Mellow!! Has a voice that sounds like Aaliyah...but her songs may remind some of 702. Too much like 702(the song where's my girls at?"" is what they sing)...the all girl group! Partially because her producers are the same ones that recently produced the new 702 album (Soulshock and Karlin).The slow break beat style is what she brings to this new album...but there could be a little more variety in styles! Overall a good buy to chill and listen too! Definately she has grown up!!"
4,Nice Comeback,"I listened to samples of Tracie's new album and it is off the hook. I don't know why people are so disappointed even though some of the reviews are positive. I thought the album was good even though there are not that many ballads, it still provides cool r&b/hip-hop grooves. Even though I have not listen to the whole album, I am just going to go out on a limb and give it 4 stars."
3,Tracie!!!,"Tracie has come back with a grown up edge to her lyrics and vocals. It's almost hard to listen to her talking about making love and being in love since she started out at 12 and is now 23, but she pulls it off well. The only downfall to this cd I would say is that she used Soulshock and Karlin for the whole thing. It like Brandy's ""Never Say Never"" (Rodney Jerkins, producer)sounds like you are on an endless loop that keeps repeating itself."
4,"It's been a long time, I'm glad she's back","I have been a fan of Tracie since Hide & Seek, Symptoms of true love, and Imagination. Her Make a difference album I was in love with, especially her ballads. Its been 9 years and I have always wondered what happened and now she's back. On this album I was very impressed with the music especially for her more upbeat music. And teaming up with Soulshock & Karlin is good, because her music doesn't sound like someone elses nor does it have alot of samples which makes her style original. For my personal music taste the only drawback is that there aren't enough ballads. If she had at least 2 more I'd be happy. But I love her album and like ""Shanice"" I'm glad to see her back on the scene. This is a good CD especially if you like jeep-style music."
3,Sing Tracie,"This would be an excellent CD had it been sung by one of the young newer artists. But for Miss Spencer, she can do a whole lot better. This CD does not do justice to the girl from Waterloo. While Tracie does an ok job with what she has to work with, she has so much more to offer vocally. Remember her rendition of John Lennon's Imagine. That's the Tracie Spencer I know and appreciate."
2,Tracie I expected so much more....,I honestly love Tracie but this album is not a good example of her best work! The intro single is mainly the only song worth listening to!
5,Great puppy carrier,I just love this carrier! No one knows my new Chihuahua puppy is even in it. I just love the fact that the mesh netting closure zips up all the way to prevent my little angel from escaping. You do need to line the bottom with a puppy pad just in case of an accident. But since it's quilted the whole thing can just be thrown in the washer for cleaning. So no really worries.
3,Sign of the times,"I bought this drill press based on the reviews I read here. Here's my two cents. The first drill press I received was defective. The heavy metal casting which holds the upright cracked completely through (!) just by hand-tightening the wingnut which keeps the workpiece support at the desired height. It was either a defective casting or cheap metal or both. An e-mail to Fisch resulted in a replacement unit, which seems OK so far. Since reviewers here also seemed to like the customer service at Fisch, I wrote them to ask about a part of the press which was not explained in the manual. Fisch ignored this message - never replied. My impression is the item & company seems average - no more, no less. You may be satisfied with the unit you receive, but I don't think it deserves 4-5 stars."
2,Chuck is junk,"I've had this DP for almost 2 years and have used it very lightly. The DP itself is ok, especially at the price. The chuck is junk though. It's very tempremental and sometimes won't open fully or lock down tightly on the drill bit.I would not have bought this DP when I did if I had known how irritating it would be to work with."
3,Not Quite Up to Par,"I'm a big fan of Gooseberry patch series, and received my copy in the mail with baited breath. Christmas Book 5 was not as good as others in the series. Why? Mostly because I found some of the crafts rather boring and drab, and nothing anyone might actually want to make... Also, there weren't quite as many recipes, and the ones which were included were mostly desserts. While I like desserts, I think there should be a fair mix of entrees and other snacks included to round out a compilation. Overall, an average book. Not quite up to par, and nothing I see myself using using for anything other than shelf weight to round out my collection."
5,NEAT!,"a neighbor gave me a folder on Gooseberry Patch books and I thought they looked so nice, I was delighted to see you offerring this item. It is charming and delightful. Thank you so much"
2,Sucks,It took way to long to get here. I followed the very little directions on how to put it on. It didn't stay on right and ripped on of his spikes out.
5,Design Your Loft,Need some ideas for your loft apartment? This book is full of great decorating plans you can put into action.
2,Freaky vampire stripper flick,"This is a low budget(or should I say ""No Budget"") try at a vampire stripper horror flick.I think more money went into the box cover artwork than the film itself. A waitress at a stripclub wants to be a dancer to make more money. She ends up taking lessons from a stripper whohappens to be Queen of the vampires. The film suffers from bad make-up, low rent special effects,and some very poor acting. There is nothing scary in the film and nothing erotic except for alap dance scene between the two female leads which is hot for a little while. I did not expect muchfrom this movie so I can not complain all that loudly. I would note that Julie Strain makes acameo as one of the customers in the strip joint."
3,Different,"I have all of the Celtic Twilight series and found both #6 & #7 to be a departure from the quiet beauty that marked the first CD's in the series. If there is a #8, I will preview it, but will not promise a purchase, until after the preview."
2,Bratz clock radio phone,"I don't care for the clock part. At night, the screen does not stay light up so you can't see what time it is. It only lights up when you pick up the receiver of the phone or touch a button on the clock."
5,Feel this music -- you're there,"Have you visited the village churches of England? You're there if you sit down with this beautiful recording by Procol Harum's good Commander and his friends. The title song, by Brooker/Reid, is as beautiful and mature as any song written in this century and is an all-time keeper. How the mix of Procol and church songs came off so beautifully is still beyond me and I've been listening since this album was available just to phans. Please. Slow down. Weep. Hear this music. Gary Brooker is to be thanked."
4,Canadian drama....filmed in France !,"What an interesting idea.....Director Gilles Carle wrote a story of 19th century Canada and then filmed it in France, so we have a very ""French"" production, in the colours and drama, set in a village created in the Jura that looks like old Canada!"
3,Important points marred by intellectual arrogance,"I received (the English version of) this book as a Christmas present (1998) and read it with great interest. The authors present a convincing pillory of the usage of mathematics' and physics' concepts in French philosophy. However, the work is marred by the authors' adventures into the philosophy of science and the validity of relativism in general. Their comments on these points are very shallow and unconvincing.Nevertheless the book is a good thought catalyst (if only for the outrage value) and I've bought further books on epistemology since reading it.7 January 1999"
3,A frustrating but important book,"First of all, this is not the liberating, savvy kid vs. naked tyrant, feel-good story its supporters would have you believe. It's a fascinating and highly problematic critique of contemporary philosophy.Much of the critique is valid but the entire project is weakened by an attitude of smirking condescension towards the material. Are we to believe that the most prominent philosophers of the second half of this century and all of the people who take them seriously are idiots or charlatans? The authors don't seem at all curious about what it is people find valuable or interesting in this work. That's a sloppy way to read philosophy.I see this book as an opportunity to begin a real dialogue about what it means to think seriously about the world around us, about what intellectual common ground might look like, beyond the limits of naive academic over-specialization."
1,"The book is high on polemicism, short on analysis","This book makes the following argument, simple but brilliant:These books of French philosophy are hard to read and I don't understand them. Ergo, the books are incomprehensible and meaningless. Ergo, anybody who claims to understand them is a fraud.Sokal's book sells itself partly as a shocking exposure of the emptiness and fraudulence of the work of Giles Deleuze & Felix Guattari. Can you guess how many of their books he talks about? One. Well, not quite one: a chapter. Well, not quite a chapter: a page from a chapter. Actually, not quite a page: a paragraph. *Who*, exactly, is peddling ""charlatanism and nonsense"" as scholarship...?"
2,Works if someone is close and paying attention,"I debated on a one star. As a signaling device for communication, it might work well. As an attention getter, no. I seemed to work, but low in volume when I tested under good conditions...i.e. not an emergency, but one time I did need to use it when i was having equalization issues and could not continue to descend. Maybe 15ft away when was able to get it out and sound....nothing, no reaction. fortunately they eventually looked around, but i realized that this device does not really signal well for assistance."
2,"um, weak","I was recommended by none other than the Wall Street Journal recently that this was the ""scariest movie ever"". Not. Want scary? Avoid this over-hyped trash with all its subliminal scary faces and rent ""The Exorcist"". Or, go to youtube and watch the Mumbai attacks for real fear. This movie is not scary! It is stupid. Even ""Dracula"" wth Bela Lugosi was at least far more interesting. Put a stake through this one's heart."
1,LOOKS LIKE AN OLD STAG MOVIE,"A very cheap, and crude, movie, even by 1930s standards----only reason professional critics and others rave about this junk is because a famous director made it.This is, basically, a silent movie---a couple years after THE JAZZ SINGER.HORROR OF DRACULA, from terrance fisher, is a million times better, though fisher isn't the respectable celebrity like the director of this junk that pretentious movie fans admire."
4,Gooseflesh for the connoisseur,"This is one of the movies where you get really frightened without actually knowing why. There is no gore (exept perhaps when the old doctor gets suffocated by tons of grain), but a lot of sinister images. Actually, if I hadn't read what the plot of the film is, I wouldn't have known, still, I felt very frightened by its whispering, shady, sinister images."
4,Missing Scene,Love Criterion. Love this film. I own the Image version and I noticed that the Criterion version is missing a crucial scene. In the Image version we see the stake being driven into the vampire. The Criterion version glosses over this key scene. Had anyone notived this???
5,A Great Transfer Of A Great Classic Horror,"For anyone interested on the history of horror, this film is a must. Carl Dreyer has a unique style of storytelling and filming that stands apart from all other filmmakers. I have other transfers of this film, but the Criterion version is the best. A viewer will notice some spots and blotches left on the film. Criterion does not clean it up completely. From reading the write-ups of previous Criterion transfers I own, I gather the reason they do this is to preserve the version in a state that would be very similar to how it would have looked in the theatres when it was released. They would not have been pristine. The technology was not advanced enough and, in this case, a viewer in the early 30s would have noticed some spots and blotches still left on the film. I hope this write-up was helpful and I hope you enjoy this film as much as I do."
4,Different than the rest,"This Kino/Image DVD is the same edition they previously released to laser and VHS and to date it's the best-looking print out there. Also included is a terrific Ladislaw Sarewicks short ""The Mascot"" AKA ""The Devil's Ball"".This is one of my favorite horror films, it's truly stands alone as one of the most serious and artful films of the genre. Those who dismiss it as boring are dragging around too many preconceptions of what vampire/horror film should be rather than surrendering to it's unearthly and dream-like atmosphere.My only gripe is the clunky way this print was subtitled. If it were restored today they would probably come up with a more clever way of replacing the Danish titles with English ones."
1,"Classic film, lousy DVD","NOTE: The following comments from 2002 pertain to the Image Entertainment DVD.Carl Dreyer's classic horror film _Vampyr_ is desecrated on a substandard DVD. The image transfer is nearly unwatchable (as is true of the VHS cassette), with extensive grain and artifacts. The sound is muffled and garbled, with persistent loud hissing; most of the underscoring and some of the dialogue are lost under the noise. The English subtitles -- which cannot be turned off -- are large and intrusive.The only bonus feature on the disc is _The Mascot_, an unrelated short subject by the stop-motion master Starewicz. (Imagine what would happen if the Brothers Quay were dropped into the 1930s, and you'll have a good idea of Starewicz.) It's a great short. Unfortunately, its DVD transfer is even worse than the main feature's.Dreyer and Starewicz deserve better. Criterion, where are you?UPDATE (April 2008): Criterion is releasing a deluxe 2-DVD edition of VAMPYR in July 2008."
2,"Disappointing ""Classic""","Vampyr is a film designed to baffle the viewer - and it succeeds brilliantly. With no coherent story line or identification of the characters, and with its disconnected jumps from one scene to another, this viewer was left completely at sea.The Criterion release adds a screenplay book and a smaller booklet about the film and its history. The special features on Disc 2 are also interesting but neither these nor the commentary provides much clarity about what is going on.Criterion did what it could to render the poor-quality film elements viewable, but picture quality is only fair. Sound, conversely, is quite good.This is not in the same league as other Criterion titles such as The Third Man and M."
2,Umm ..Art students listen up,"This film was disappointing for me because I expected a scary,haunting film. Its a great primer for students going into filmaking and cinematography. Light and shadow,texture, depth of field, and symbolism to pad the storyline give this film educational credibility."
1,Down loaded another film,I asked for this film but got a hodgepodge of other films and TV shows in it's place. Strange.
2,Not a Classic.,"To be honest, I did not like this movie. I found it boring and the storyline to be absurd. I cannot recommend it."
5,Outstanding meditation!,"We often think of ""drinking the cup"" as accepting and living with the sorrows of life! From Henri Nouwen's writings, it be comes obvious that ""drinking the cup"" includes both the sorrows and the joys of life ....and sharing them with others. For me, this little book came at just the right time ... a perfect meditation written for each of us to understand."
5,"Coping with loss, tragedy, randomness in life","One of Nouwen's more autobiograhical books and also one of his last, this quiet meditation on how we deal with the difficult parts of life was very helpful to me as a parent of a child with disability. The descriptions of the L'Arche community sent me to other Nouwen works to learn more about that movement. This is very simply written and positive in its outlook. I would recommend it for an adult discussion group and also for private devotional reading (and re-reading)."
5,Out of the Ordinary!,"This book is one of the most original pieces of fiction I have read in a long time, but I can see where it might not be for everyone.It required me to think ""ouside of the box"". Some of the passages actually left me breathless with amazement. Others made me scratch my head and think: ""Huh?"". But all in all - it is an awesome book that defies description.It changed the way I think about the world - and, for me, that's what good fiction is all about."
2,Too much 'creativity' for its own good,"The Thin Place tries too hard to be creative, and in the process misses out on a fairly important aspect of a novel: being fun to read. The book is about a bunch of people in a small town who all do seemingly pointless things, in which characteristic they are closely mirrored by the novel's plot.My main problem with the novel is that it is simply not enjoyable. The author inserts so many witty ovservations on nature and 'creative' media (police reports, diaries, astrology columns, etc.) that at a certain point it becomes more of a scrapbook than a novel. This may be creative, but it doesn't make for a good read. At the same time the book is so packed with metaphors and similes that it becomes absolutely claustrophobic.All in all, can't recomment this book - it's more effort to read than it's worth."
4,pw review riddled with errors,"this was a fantastic book, alive with wonder, humor,sensitivity, a qualified cynicism combined with a spiritual questing. Almost perfect, but for contrived elements of the climax.All of the talk of ""difficulty"" in some reviews makes it sound more arduous of a read than it actually is: It is always engaging in its prose, but only ""difficult"" in the sense that nothing is ""pat"" in meaning, but multilayered and thought-provoking.the above pw review has at least two errors:1)the schoolteacher, Inez Fair, did not perish with the schoolchildren in the disaster.2)Billie is not a divorcee, but a widow -- her husband was murdered."
2,Disappointing,"I picked up this book after seeing it on NPR's list of summer/beach books. I wonder if they actually read it. I thought it would deal with the thin place between worlds. I stuck with it to the bitter end ... thinking something was going to happen, but couldn't recommend anyone else bother. The description of the characters was detailed but nothing happens. I believe a good book has to have more of a plot than this one did."
2,Did I Miss Something?,"After hearing praise for this book, I decided to read it. The first line was intriguing, so I was patient at first. As I read chapter after chapter, I kept wondering - when is someting going to happen? It was boring and I felt like there was no connection between the characters, though maybe thats just what the author wanted you to think. The book certainly did not live up to the first line, or even the back cover, for that matter. I felt cheated, and the only part that had any excitement was the last few pages! All in all, it just seemed like a bunch of normal people in a small town going about their daily lives. I just didn't get the point."
2,"Beautifully Written, But Too Remote and Inaccessible","The Thin Place is beautifully written, but I can't recommend it. The novel is too remote and too inaccessible.Because I appreciated Davis's craftmanship, I plowed through. But while I admired The Thin Place, I can't say that I enjoyed most of it.For those who want a thumbnail, think Thornton Wilder's Our Town with much of the likability stripped out. Davis crafts several characters who arouse sympathy, but because she has chosen a broad palette, they don't stand out sufficiently to make you care about the novel as a whole.My two stars are for Davis's prose. Had her prose been less luminous, this review would have been one star and I would have branded the book unreadable. Like other under-whelmed reviewers on this site, I agree with the poster who felt that a novel that demands so much work of the reader is more of a household chore than a good book."
2,The Thin Place,Could not get the plot or purpose. Did not get past chapter 5. It really was not my type of reading.
3,Interconnection in a Small Town,"The Thin Place presents readers with a small New England town where the spiritual coexists with the mundane. The friendship of three pre-teen girls teeters on the edge of some significant life changes at the same time one of the girls, Mees, has amazing, unexplained healing powers. There are many detailed depictions of the residents of the town ranging from the girls to the inhabitants of the local nursing home, and the novel is all about how the fate of each member of the community affects everyone else as in small town relatedness taken to the karmic power.Although I enjoyed the book for the most part,especially some of the offbeat characters, some of the plot seemed a bit contrived."
2,Would Not Recommend,"After the second chapter, I had to keep telling myself to ""stick with it."" I know there is a story in there somewhere, but I felt like I had to really dig to make the discovery. I wanted to take the book apart, cut out paragraphs and chapters and paste them back together in a different order to find a cohesive story. On the positive side, there are some interesting characters and I did enjoy a look at the dogs' side of things. I won't say that I wouldn't try the author again, but I will not be recommending this book to my friends."
1,Couldn't finish it...,I couldn't make heads or tails of this book and more importantly I couldn't stay awake. This book didn't make much sense to me and life is too short so I didn't bother to finish it.I realized when I was on page 70 something and I couldn't even write a one sentence summary on the book that it was probably time to move on.
1,Literary Narcissim,"I struggled through this book hoping it would come together at some point, but concluded that this author belongs to that university-bound school of literati who write to demonstrate their own brilliance with the language. She does not love her character and considers story beneath her. If you want to ponder this book to prove you are brilliant, good luck."
3,Easy to appreciate,"Many times during the reading of this book - I considered putting it down and getting rid of it. It's not exactly an easy read - and I can't say that I was very engrosed in it - nor was I especially concerned about finding out how it ended. I had a hard time keeping track of who was who...but when I was in a character's mind - I did enjoy being there. I liked seeing, smelling, feeling the world through someone else's senses.Though the flow of action was hard for me to get a grip on - the flow of the world, the feel of the season (summer) was very vivid. This is the 2nd book of Davis's that I've read - and as with the first one (The Walking Tour) - I spend most of the time feeling lost and as if I am walking around with blinders on - but what I can see is like a painting; true to life but larger than life. Dripping with color and texture and emotion, Davis's books are easy for me to appreciate but far more difficult to lose myself in."
5,I loved it!,"I loved it. Mysterious, surprising, funny, great story, great characters and I loved the animal world Davis enters. It was an extremely satisfying read. I want to read her other books now!"
2,I did not care for it.,"This book is written by several view points. Some teenage girls, dogs, badgers, old diaries. I listened to the audiobook for about one and a half of the CD's and then gave up on it because it was not holding my interest. There really was no plot per se, just a whole bunch of different little anectodotes which seemed to be only loosely connected to each other. It wasn't meaningful to me. I didn't want to continue."
3,Quirky,"I'm usually a fan of quirky fiction but I just didn't get this book. At the end I was thinking ""was that it; did I miss something?"""
1,Fragmented and Slow,"I really thought that I was going to enjoy this novel but instead I found myself looking forward to it being over. After 200 pages, I still felt like I was reading the introduction and waiting for the real story to begin. I did not care about any of the characters and I found the story to be boring. On a separate note, I have absolutely no idea how the cover art fits in with the story because none of the drawn images figure into the story. I wonder what the purpose of that was? I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,painful,"What was i thinking? i actually had this in my wishlist and got it for christmas. I never am one to give up on a book, but there are just too many good ones out there to struggle like this!! i told myself to at least get to page 50...I CANT!! I have no clue as to what ive read so far! For me to toss a book and not even put it on a shelf...its bad. Im tossing it!!"
1,"Not for me, thank you.","I agree totally with the reviewer who said that, if you have to work that hard to stay with a book, then you should go do an actual household chore. This book is a real push, and my main guideline for reading is pretty simple: if I don't look forward to getting back into it, then I'm not enjoying the book and I probably won't finish it.Why are so many writers trying to be ""quirky"" these days? Doesn't anyone just tell a great story anymore? When Mees revived the man on the beach, I honestly had no idea what it was she was doing. Where was she putting her hand? In his mouth? Somewhere else? I'm not a squeamish person; I just like some clarity. I don't think that's asking too much.In my opinion, this book is over-written and trite. I won't read her books again."
5,Absolutly Brilliant!!! A must for any Madonna fan,This movie is really good.It combines great concert footage with a really in depth look into what is Madonna.It is also neat to look at how a concert of that magnitude is put togther.
2,"Starts out great, ends up another Madonna publicity stunt.","Alek Keshishian's vision was indeed a noble one. This could have easily become a true ""rockumentary"", if Madonna had not become aware of the camera and tried to be cutesy and show off. The beginning of the film is wonderful...telling Alek to ""get out"" of her business conversations. Later in the film, the ""candid"" moments appeared very contrived. The bed scene with the dancers and singers? C'mon! Are we to believe this is candid? It's probably a good movie for the hardcore fans, but the rest of us are left with an empty and cheated feeling."
5,Awesome! - Nothing Like It !!!,"At a time where Madonna was at the top, I thought it was very courageous of her to let you into her personal life even if it was such a ""high life"" a lot of us cannot understand what that must feel like but after seeing this my whole attidude towards the lady changed! It show's how a female star at the age of 32 has TOTAL control of her life not to mention a talent that far exceeds anything i've ever heard or seen! I have seen the entire concert and was left breathless at the end of it! Her opening rendition of ""Express Yourself"" is the best live performance I have ever seen and the song wasn't even one of my favorites! the costumes and the coriography is amazing (for its time)The only thing I didn't get was what she was doing with Warren Beatty? Glad she got over that one quickly!Highly recommend this.What other artist do you know that has had the courage to do a similar thing?"
2,I bOuGhT tHiS fOr ThE bLoNdE aMbItIoN PeRfOrMeNcEs,"Although the movie is good , I would perfer more perfomences from the blonde ambition tour like :1. material girl2. cherish3. open your heart4. & like a prayerI hope that she releases the BA tour on VHS or DVD . I think every Madonna fan does !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not necessarily for fans of her music only.,"Even if you hate Madonna's music, like me (sorry, I'm a classic rock man), you can still enjoy this movie for the way it was filmed, especitally the black and white behind-the-scenes of her life during her 1990 tour. You can simply skip the chapters of concert performances.And besides, it's always great to watch Madonna act like a total slut!!!"
2,Like a Prima Donna,"Holy S***! Enough said. And I own the IMMACULATE COLLECTION album and love it. 1 1/2 stars. Terrific as a film record of American narcissism, crapshoot superstardom, and arrested development. She's never going to exit from adolescence, is she? She was 33 years old when this was made. Unbelievable. (Not to take away from her prowess as a businesswoman or promoter--no quarrel, there!)----Okay...I can see from the other reviews that I'm reacting to the person rather than to the product. Yeah, the documentary was done very competently. But Madonna, the person, is just soooooo annoying.**(I wrote this little review in August 2005. Now it's April 2008. I just saw a Madonna interview where she talked about how self-centered she used to be and how glad she is that she's not like that anymore. So I think what I said above is fair, except the part about growing up. Looks like she made it, after all.)"
1,Madonna Truth or Dare blu ray,My old dvd is better. The only blu ray parts of this vhs to dvd to blu ray are the credits. I guess if you like snowy black and white and color blu ray buy it. This is not blu ray.
1,Incorrect Region !!!,"Atención:RESPECTO AL BLU-RAY Madonna: Truth Or DareEl problema es que me han enviado el Blu-RayCon región A / 1 (America)Y NO PUEDO REPRODUCIRLO !!!Yo necesito con región B / 2 (Europa)Por favor: me pueden enviar el Blu-Ray CORRECTO?Gracias,Carles Rius Vidal-----------"
1,europe,Truth or dare! For me a sentimental movie of my youth and childhood. Iam living in the Netherlands and this regioncode does not working in my country. We have in Holland regioncode 2 and this movie is regioncode 1 USA. I contacted with amazon but a reaction have not received yet. It was very disapointing. I have a blue ray disc and it does not play yet.Maarten Schriks the netherlands
4,madonna truth or dare,"Being a die-hard Madonna fan my views of her slightley changed after seeing this video. Thoughout the entire tape Madonna protrades herself as a spoiled brat. In some scences she would whine and throw fits if she didn't get her way. I know that if I was Madonna I would have been extremly embarrased and would have not realeased this to the public. Though I was disappointed with Madonna's attuitude and the way she carried herself though out this documentry , it was interesting and watchable , and I enjoyed being able to see the true Madonna , but let us prey she has changed over the years. After seeing this tape you will be able to see Madonna the human being rather than Madonna the star. That is why I gave it 4 rather than 3 , 2, or ,1. If you like Madonna I suppose you could give this movie a try. Though it can be shocking at some points , if you want to see madonna living her life day by day , well , here it is. Enjoy!"
4,Madonna at her best.,"Madonna is great as herself. This is such an interesting background look at the lives of those who bring us these great shows on stage. If only the music parts of the film weren't so boring. It really took from what was going on. You start getting interested and then a music performance pops on. It's like watching a really, really interesting show, then it breaking for commerical. Huge Madonna fans won't mind them, but others will. Over all, the behind the scenes stuff is great, but if you want the show, they should have sold it by it's self."
1,In Bed with Madonna....,"...was the European release title. But since I've never been very much impressed by her as a 'singer',and because I've been very much impressed by her (lack of) talent as an actress (I've seen only some trailers and it was more than I could stand), I dare to say the truth: I will be very happy not to see her in bed, and to leave her to all who appreciate provocative vulgarity...and I'm very far of beeing prudish."
1,Truth or dud is more like it,I saw this movie (for free) in the theater when it came out and if I had to pay good money to watch it I would have demanded my money back. It has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen! I was so bored I almost fell asleep watching it. This movie is a waste of good hard earned money and I would not recomend buying it or wasting your time watching it.
1,Oh Please!,"I can't believe anyone likes this movie... it's overly dramtic, and shows the world what Madonna really is. Shallow and low class."
2,"Good music...lousy ""acting""","Although this movie was supposed to be an intimate portrayl of Madonna, it seemed to me like it was just lousy acting. I have a hard time believing many of the things she says, and I also believe it was overly dramatic. The music was excellent, and a good compilation of her work. But that was all it was. For those of you who are tempted to buy this, I'd reconsider. Buy her CD's instead."
5,Madonna you are fearless!,"What a fantastic documentary. One every Madonna fan or even skeptic should own. It is raw, real, and genuine and makes us all see behind the curtain of an icon. Madonna is fearless and true to herself with no regrets. Madonna you are truly an icon."
2,"More Ego-Tripping, Less Rock","A potentially good concert film evolves into a Madonna hagiography. Some excellent music is overshadowed by the singer's continual ego-tripping. Alek Keshishian receives director credit, but the Material Girl pulls the strings. Even die-hard fans deserve more entertainment value."
4,Inside Look at 1990's Madonna,"This movie/documentary is a combination of 1) black and white backstage footage of Madonna and her crew and 2) colorful concert footage. If you are a Madonna fan, this movie is worth having just for the great concert footage, especially because the Blonde Ambition tour footage has not been widely released. I also appreciated the backstage footage. I was surprised at how candid Madonna was at times regarding problems with her show- whether it was content or technical problems. I found it interesting that Madonna's main concern was ""Did you like my show?"" She is always the consummate entertainer. This movie is an interesting look at a multi-faceted and colorful performer- on and off stage."
5,Kursk ..... finally explained,"Col. Glantz and Mr. House have finally defined the Battle of Kursk in a thoughtful, engaging and methodical approach. More accessible than George Nipe's very good work on Kursk, this is probably the best book on the definitive battle of the Russian Front. A serious, well-researched study."
5,"Great, detailed account","This book MUST be owned by any serious military history reader of WWII. The detail, and the maps are unparalleled. The maps are especially impressive, and allow you to follow the account of the battle totally. I look forward to more such books by the author. Just a word of caution, this is not a book about the ""human interest"" side of the battle; nor is it intended for the casual reader."
2,"Rough riding but informative, 2.5 stars.","I agree with another poster who said this book is a bombardment of facts and figures without much readability. If you are looking for facts and figures, check it out; if you are looking for something resembling a story or something more than barely adequate structure to impart wads of information, this probably isn't your bag."
4,Good Music&the Brothers Can Rock,"I always dug Living Color.Proud of these Brothers for showing that Brothers could Rock&where the Foundation came from.""cult of Personality"" still knocks you out.Vernon Reid was rocking on the Axe&Cory Glover throws down on Vocals.the Lyrics come at you&give a lesson all at once.""Glamour Boys"" brings the same intensity.Living Color like Fishbone deserve More Dap than they have ever gotten."
3,glamour boys?,This CD is decent. It has 1 great song(cult of personality) and a couple of o.k songs. Glamour boys is an especially funny track. Overall the CD is worth it just because Cult of Personality is on it. If you don't like that song you won't like any of the other tracks on this record.
1,"Terrible, they melted in the car.","So I bought 15 pairs of these and I had them in the car in a container and after one afternoon in the car, they melted and and now are all very curved and difficult to use, almost unusable."
3,Wish I had ordered plastic mallets,"These are a good product. But I messed up and ordered rubber when what I really needed was a hard, brittle plastic to get the sharp, piercing tone I was going for out of my set of bells. Oh well. This product is good if what you really want is RUBBER."
3,Unending Pain,"Pain -- unending pain, no relief, the desire to end it all, hope for a cure, missing the good times, I knew them all - all the themes in Linda Martinson's ""Poetry of Pain."" I even identified with the inflamed blur behind the word ""PAIN"" on the blue cover. Linda's poetry helped me realize that my experience with chronic pain is not unique: others have similar reactions. I understand too that many of my friends would identify with her poems. Some experience chronic pain; others live or work near someone in distress, so I ordered several copies. Thank you, Linda, for sharing your awareness. Your poems tell the story."
3,Good for sufferers and those that love them,"I thought the book was good, in that it tells the pain and agony and frustration of fibromyalgia. The last four poems are more poignant in their imagery and optimism. The poet is not very creative, however, and that upsets me. These would work fine as essays, but as poems on their own, they are unfortunately dull. I read them all with interest since I have severe fibro myself."
2,Great for my purpose,This Book is one of two on Proverbs. In its ebook style it is very hard to read and very technical. For my class on Preaching /Teaching for a Doctor of Ministry this just what was needed. Do not try to run throuh this Book it is difficult to read and understnd and must be used as a real study not just to skim. For why it was written it is great but as a book just to read it is much to deep and its style make speed reading near to impossible
1,Only Part of Book,Incredible that only the first half of Bruce Waltke's work on Proverbs is available in Kindle format! Release the rest of Proverbs in Kindle format!
4,Better Than the College Store,"I tried to buy a Penn State Sweatshirt at the Penn State College store. What a hassle and in the end, four days before Christmas, they let me know the sweatshirt was out of stock. I went thru Amazon and I got the sweatshirt in time for Christmas Eve Night. Nice! And it was better quality."
5,Great CD,I love this cd and the performer. His voice is fantastic. I have seen him perform live and what a show...great
5,Daydream with these girls!,"I remember this album when I was 13. I love this hot CD. It brings back memories. Their name stems from their shared goal of living each day to the fullest and striving to achieve as much as possible before the symbolic sun of their youth sets. They delivered a powerful, diverse mix of sizzling R&B and blazing hip-hop flavor. The girls are veterans of the business despite their young age, consistently delivering cool, contemporary beats in a youthful, yet timeless fashion(in 2000). This album pulsates with golden voices,bangin' beats,serious slow jams,and a plethora of passionate lyrics. Each song depicts various levels of romance. This album should have been promoted more. Remember,this was 2000."
3,my honest opinion,"Well, being dat i bought before dark. I honestly think that they did real good with their cd. They show their talents and im wishing they would come out with another cd.Chris M Williams"
4,One of the Best R&B Girl Group CD's of 2000,"I brought this CD back in 2000, when I was 18 and now that I'm about to turn 23, I can still remember when I bought this CD. I thought this was a great CD and these girls had it all, talent, personality,looks, and a great production team, but one thing they didn't have was great promotion.They became one of my favorite groups of 2000, after my dissapointment over Destiny's Child (with them kicking out my girls LeToya and Latavia) along with ""So Plush"", another girl group who had good voices and talent, but were lost in the tidal wave of Destiny's Child (the new group with Beyonce, Kelly, and Michelle). I would love to see ""Before Dark"" have a reunion. It would be great.My favorite songs on this CD:How Could YouAs Far As They KnowAlways on My MindCome CorrectTough LoveDaydreamShePush ""N"" ShoveIf you want to hear an underated group of 1999/2000,definitely check these girls out!"
3,It was good!,"Before Dark are great. But they get no publicty. You never hear their songs on the radio and mtv and bet don't play them. Sometime The box will so that's cool. The album is good they can blow. My fav songs are ""How could you"" ""As Far as they know"" ""Monica"" ""Baby"" ""Come correct"" ""Back around"" ""Push n Shove"" and ""Given so much"" I know I know that's a lot of fav songs but hey the album is hott so support Before dark and buy it!"
2,Nothing Here,I was so not impressed with this album that I gave it away after the second time of listening to it. The vocals and lyrics are very teen-wannabe-R&B. They are very forgetable.
4,Man...this cd got slept on...,"This was a great cd. The crazy thing about this is that my sister had this cd in her collection, and I had never heard of them until I borrowed her cd. These girls could really sing. I have ""Push & Shove"" on a slow mix cd that I made for myself. Too bad they didn't go further than they did because I thorougly enjoyed the cd."
3,"Nice idea, but. . .","The pictures in this book are great, especially for small children to look at while you read the story. But, read ALL of the other reviews. It's not coincidence that many are complaining of the quality of the stories. They're not TERRIBLE, but they're written too advanced for small children, and the stories are too short for older children. The stories are super-condensed (four or five page) versions of the movies, so if you haven't seen the movies, they're pretty hard to follow. We let our daughter look at the pictures while we tell our own versions of the stories because the written words are too hard for her to follow. Aside from that, the actual BOOK is terribly made. The binding on ours came completely off and it lost several pages within a week of very light use."
2,Stories are Not Edited Well,"I was dissapointed with this volume. The pictures are nice, but I thought the stories were edited poorly, making it difficult for young children to understand the story if they were unfamiliar with it without a lot of explanation. Also, the book uses a lot of large words for young children. And, even though I realize many of these are ""love"" stories, they still came across as a little heavy-handed on the romance for my taste."
1,The only kid's book I've ever thrown in the trash,"This bizarre book will not make sense to your children unless they have memorized every Disney animated film every made. The stories start randomly in the middle and have no narrative flow. Many are oddly disturbing in tone and content. We received this book as a gift, started to read it to our girls and were frankly horrified. I think the most telling thing is the earlier reviewer who said that she loved the book because it was the same size as other Disney books and looked great on her shelf! That is clearly its best use...leave it on the shelf."
2,terribly mangled stories,These stories have been so poorly edited and abridged that many of them are very difficult to follow. This is a transparent effort on the part of Disney to simply sell more of their junk. It's shameful the way they treat narrative and a real disservice to the kids who are seduced by the pictures and want to read this book.
1,DISAPPOINTING,"This is a collection of what should be wonderful, classic children's stories. Unfortunately, these versions are SO abbreviated that they make very little sense, and lack all that Disney magic. Do yourself--and your child--a favor, and buy each story as an individual book. These ""collections"" pack in a lot of titles, but the wonderful details and true story lines of the individual tales are sadly absent. A huge disappointment."
5,A book for girls to treasure!,"This is a lovely book, one that little girls will read and reread. It has short versions of some of the most beloved Disney stories. A perfect gift for girls, this book will delight for years."
1,Unreadable,"This book butchers and jumbles beloved stories into nonsense. It arbitrarily leaves out entire storylines and characters, skips over key scenes, and uses language completely unintelligible to toddlers all for the sake putting an unnecessary 'friendship' slant on each retelling of a Disney movie. I understand the value of product tie-ins, but if just a little care were given to writing, this could've been a wonderful collection of stories instead of a mishmash of garbled ad copy. DO NOT BUY."
2,Too Small,"I purchased this item thinking that it would fit my Civic 2006 and it fits to small. It said that it would fit my car but it does (too small) it doesn't even cover half of my windshield. I had to go out and purchase another one, currently I am in the process of returning this shade to the original sender. REFUND."
3,It was a great idea,"I think the makers of this extended battery had a great idea; just wish that is could have come in a smaller battery. The extra door is nice, however I have not found a case to fit this extra bulk the battery causes. My battery life continues to be about 1 1/2 days with my average phone and internet usage (roughly 2 hours/day)...seems fine for me."
2,Not all that we had expected,"My 21 month old was saying tractor long before he ever said anything else. He loves to go to the family farm and sit on all the different old tractors and ride them with his daddy. But, this 27 minute video didn't even begin to show much of anything. Just a couple of tractors riding through a dusty field chewing up some corn and wheat straw. The video promises to show you cows being milked and bales of hay being made......where? We saw cows but no milking machines. We saw square bales of hay being spit into a trailer but no show on the actual making of them. I was so disappointed in this video. People that love it have no clue that they aren't even seeing anything. How about a longer video with ""Big Bud"" and more combine action? 30 minutes is just barely long enough to get a tractor warmed up where I come from."
4,Plenty of Tractors here. Good for young children.,"My 2 1/2 year old son likes this video. The country-western music isn't too bad--and I'm not a country & western fan. Dad can still watch this video without going crazy! There are lots of nice views of a working farm / dairy, and the narration doesn't make you feel like you're being ""dumbed-down."" All of my Uncles & Grandparents were farmers and it made me feel nostalgic. This is a good low-key video for anyone who is interested in farm tractors."
2,Pretty [boring],This video offers an extremely superficial view of the duties of tractors on the farm. Lots of boring footage from the cab looking at the fields. My 2 yr old son watched this twice and since then wanders off bored after about 3 minutes of the tape. There are better choices out there.
2,Good but could have been better,"This is not for real Bruce Lee fans as we have all seen the childhood footages, imitators, and movie documentaries many times. The so called ""never before seen footages"" can also be seen in other Bruce Lee documentaries and demonstration tapes. What is most upsetting is the use of Bruce bio movie clips when talking about Bruce's movies. Why weren't actual Bruce Lee movie clips used to better describe his movies and martial arts ability. The only part that were worth paying for are the interviews and demonstrations."
4,long due for hollywood rip-off,"Excellent early Fassbinder classic. The tale of the widow of a factory worker -- gone psycho-killer. Mother Kuster is visited by the authorities, the press, the socialists -- all pretending to be sympathetic to her plight and all, with agendas of their own, ultimately using her. Except that the willy ""mother"" is not so helpless as she first seems. I envision Charlize Theron with great make-up and frumpy clothing ... naaaa! Pick-up this classic and check out the pleasures of great (black and white) storytelling."
3,Interesting Russian Point-of-View: Tough Read,"The author Romanov provides a wide range of information and strong points-of-view from someone who is a technical expert. The problem is the translation which reads more like the output of a language program than a well-considered, edited work.This book is not for the casual reader. It is really not a presentation of a ""story"". It's a very detailed analysis of the loss of the sub by a highly technical writer. For example, the original Russian-language schematics are presented, but without any English translations or explanations. So the reader is left to piece together cause and effect from the text, which turns out to be difficult.This is a good near-primary source for the Komsomolets tragedy, but the reader will need to have access to other narratives to put everything presented here into a cohesive perspective."
5,oh no................ this is to hot,If you like hip hop this is incredable and even if you dont then this is still hot.Oh no(track 16) is one of da total greatest joints ever.
5,"represnting queens, newyork",noreaga new album is the hottest album i have ever heard from noreaga for a solo artist but this album is better than the first album so far and all the people featured on the album ripped the lyrics so crazy and this one of the hottest album of the summer.
3,MELVYN FLYNT SA HUSTLA DOESN'T MEASURE UP,"Many rap artists go through a second album jinx, and Noreaga is the latest. It happens to the best of them Nas,Jay-Z,and Snoop. All of these artist first albums are certified classics,but they fall off a bit with their second effort. In no way does Melvyn Flynt: Da Hustla measures up to last years N.O.R.E. NO WAY WHAT SO EVER. Even Capone-N-Noreaga's WAR REPORT blows Nore's latest effort out the box. The tightest joints on the album is GANSTA'S WATCH,BLOOD MONEY PT.3,and SOMETIMES,my man Noreaga holds it down on those cuts too badd the rest of the album falls short of Noreaga incredible ability,but I'm definite when Capone-N-Noreaga drop their second joint in the year 2G it will make up for it. I mean don't get me wrong Nore is one of the illest lyricts on the East Coast it's just the fact that Melvyn Flynt:Da Hustla is not in the same category as N.O.R.E. WORD IS BOND SIGNING OFF THE YOUNGBLOOD PEACE."
2,Melvyn Flynt~Da Brick,"Noreaga was great on ""The War Report."" He was o.k. on ""N.O.R.E.,"" but the tight beats and great collabos made up for it. ""Melvyn Flynt"" is ""N.O.R.E."" without the tight beats and great collabos. ""Play That S**t"" featuring Juvenile and Lil' Wayne is the lone real standout track. ""Sometimes"" and ""Wethuggedout"" (feat. Missy) are above average tracks, but the best overall advice--buy the ""Play That S**t"" single and leave the album on store shelves."
4,"better than God's Favorite, wacker than NORE","good album. my favs are ""Sometimes"", ""Da Hustla"", ""Blood Money 3"" and ""We Don't Play That"". worth checking it out"
2,A fairly good album but CNN is better.,I liked this album especially Blood Money but I would recommend Tragedy Khadefi when he blows out the spot. In fact that it is going to be a wonderful album but Noreaga needs better beats and more creative flow I would think...
1,OMG,"I don't know why record companies put up with this foolishness. This cat cannot rap. The song ""Cocaine Business"" featuring Kelis is the only track I care for and only because Kelis' hook is the best part in the song. N.O.R.E. raps like I play basketball...and I can't even dribble.N.O.R.E., GET A APPLICATION FOR BURGER KING AND KEEP UR MOUTH SHUT!"
2,Not Worth It - The title should be changed.,"This book has a lot of information on concepts and treatments. It does not go into the details of the technique of a pitch. It is very encouraging, but with reagrds to the actual pitch they wrote,""the energy of a pitch can't be written"" or something to that effect. I would have appreciated an outline or something. They provide general info like be on time, make it brief, etc... Wow, insightful!"
2,About 5 pages of worthwhile info...,"If you are a fireman, truck driver or stock broker, this book might be useful. For anyone who knows anything about film or tv, this is pretty elementary stuff. Big type, lots of blank space on the pages, and filled with useless witty banter between the 2 ""authors"", I was very disappointed. There is a basic breakdown of what a pitch is but little concrete information is given about the process or strategies involved in making a successful pitch. The excuse is that you cannot capture the essence of a pitch in words. If this is true, why write a book? A large portion of the book is dedicated to plot summaries of popular films and TV shows. While some of this is useful, in order to illustrate the format of a treatment (a written precursor to the pitch), it feels as if this was done to get the book to a publishable length. In its current state, the information info in this book would best be served by a magazine article."
3,A Primer for Screenwritting,"The book is a good overview of the process. If nothing else the reader will get a good sense of the magnitude (and odds of success)of trying to achieve screenwriting success. It is not a ""how to"" book. The book provides meaningful insight as to the qualities inherent in successful pitching of a concept."
3,laptop bag,this bag was in good shape but was advertised as like new. That would definetly be stretching it. It was just okay.
2,disappointing,"front breaks with deffect, can not be ajusted. quality did not meet expectations. without some personal adjustments wouldn't be able to use it."
5,Nice bike!!!,My husband love it!!! He put it together in 1 hour or so. Not so difficult to assemble. Heavier than expected but feels strong and look pretty nice.
5,Best bike iv owned :D,"Best bike that iv owned, needs some work done, very heavy 37lb but i like it. nice shocks and disk breaks i bought it when it was cheap :D"
2,terrible instructions,Item arrived with terrible instructions full of typos and referencing parts that are never identified in the initial diagram. The Left peddle did not want to initially screw in. The kick stand installation instructions do not give any true install instructions that can be deciphered unless you have built a bike before.
5,This GMC bike gete 5***** ratings!,"I have looked for a heavy-duty off road bike to convert to an electric bike! At the price you can not get a better heavy-duty bike which will be able to withstand what I am going to do to it! My new bike will exceed 70 mph with no worries about the bike holding up to the challenge!It rides a little slower than flimsy speed bikes, but this is designed for off road adventures! It passes all my tests! If I can't break it, I challenge you to!It a very good bike! A little heavy but if you want a heavy-duty bike this is the real thing!"
2,Quality?,The quality of the paint has gone downhill. My last one was great (stolen) but this one gets several chips just looking at it. Now it is a few months and the seat is junk!
2,Design needs to be refined.,"Pros: great for exerciseCons: Heavy, slow, uncomfortable stock seat. The front brakes were a NIGHTMARE to adjust to stop it rubbing against the rotor (instructions not included).The handlebar quickly comes loose from its mount after riding over a few bumps OR if you brake hard and your body puts pressure on them. It's very scary and dangerous to ride like this. I used a drill to fasten the mounting screws, but they come within 1 hr every time I ride.In first gear, the chain rubs against the back tire (this section was pre-assembled)."
4,nice bike,"been riding this bike everyday since i got it a couple of weeks ago and so far so good. i had no trouble assembling this bike. everything was nicely set up for me. the only problem i had was i took my bike off road on the first day and a few thorns had punctured my tires. i bought a Slime tire fix and that took care of that. this bike is a bit on the heavy side though and i recomend replacing the tire as it is knobby. i also made a few mods like i got a riser for the handlebar, replace the saddle, and the hand grip. over all this bike is a nice workout bike does well on all terrain."
1,"This bike is NOT a 26"" Frame!!","We purchased this bike based on the belief that the frame was indeed a 26"" frame. Why do so many people not know the correct way to measure a bike? This bike has a 21"" frame. That is the measurement of the seat tube from the pedals to where the seat post enters the seat tube. THAT IS HOW YOU MEASURE FRAME SIZE...not by tire size, top tube or the down tube. I am 6'7"" and even though this is a good looking bike, it is way too small and the inaccurate description caused for a complete waste of my time. Amazon did do their part in allowing us to return the item."
3,not a review just a note for other mountain bike lovers,This GMC bike is exactly the same as the genesis bike that you can get at wally world for about $150. The only difference is that the genesis does not have rear discs. The frames and every thing else are identical. I have had mine for about 6 months and absolutely love it.
2,bad idea to buy through amazon,"product came quickly enough but box was damaged. plastic hub over rear sprocket was shattered but rest of contents seemed ok. after removing bike and starting to assemble, had all kinds of trouble. The front brake line was not connected to the handlebar. called kent and they said they usually pay to have a local bike shop assemble and tune up the bike when purchased over the net. how come i did'nt get this service when i purchased through you. another problem is the tech dept of kent is only open until 3:30 eastern time. i have a problem with shifting into highest gear on the main sprocket and work during the day so i can't reach tech support when i get home. i need help with this problem and i'm not paying a bike shop to do it.all in all i would not recomend buying a bike this way and would tell anybody that if asked. i think going to bike shop or sporting goods store would be better. if you have a problem you can talk to them and have it fixed."
3,Alright for the price,"I picked this up for $100 even, its an ok bike. I find the tires/rims combination to be awkward, the deep V rims are so very narrow compared to the wider knobby tires. there is a very noticeable wiggle (from the tire flexing side to side) when on slanted surfaces or after hitting small bumps.Like most people have commented, the brakes will almost certainly require adjustment, and the rear calliper does rub (just adjust the large retainer nut on the spoke side of the brake calliper, this adjusts the stationary pad). I still only ride this bike for short distances due to a flat tire i got on my first ride (the puncture was spoke side, so wasn't road debris). I might purchase a wider rim for the rear in the future."
3,GMC Topkick- middle of the pack,"Bike is a little flimsy for the price. Went together OK, but no instructions as most people indicated. No broken parts on receipt. My first dual suspension bike. Shifting could be more accurate, but overall an average bike for the price."
4,Excellent bike for the price. Bad assembly instructions.,"I love the quality of this bike. For the price, it is certainly one of the best options and the best bike I have owned ever. I see a problem if you try to assembly by yourself, because the instructions pamphlet is very poorly written and the images are terrible (look like a bad photocopy). I had to have it assembled by a professional shop. Other than that, the dual suspension works fine and the Shimano exchanger is of good quality. I am very satisfied with this purchase."
2,Unhappy customer .,I bought the bike 2 weeks ago only use is oneNow is making squeaky sound I don't want to spend more money to Repiar is .
3,"Nice bike, decent price but cheap parts.","It is a nice looking bike that can be easily assembled in 15 minutes or less. The only thing is that the bike was built using cheap and low quality materials and accessories. It is very heavy and the seat is uncomfortable. The rear suspension does not perform as expected. But, for the price, it is just fine."
3,I just think it is a OK bicycle.,"One month after I ride it. The chain didn't engage with the rear wheel, but the position of the chain is right. So I just put it in my car and drive home. Then it works again after I got home. It is weird."
