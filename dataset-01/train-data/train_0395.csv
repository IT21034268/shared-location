5,the best sports songs on the planet!,"This has great sports music for you to enjoy.It has many hot songs including Hip Hop Hooray, twilight zone, and Whoomp! There It Is. Those are just a few out of 20 great songs."
3,THIS CD ROCKS,"THIS CD HAS ALOT OF GREAT SONGS YOU CAN DANCE TO. BUT MY FAVORITE IS TOOTSEE ROLL. THAT SONG KICKS ""YOU KNOW WHAT""!!!!"
3,Fun,It was on sale and took me on a stroll down memory lane as a lot of the songs come from when I was growing up. Good to get pumped if you are playing a video game or something or getting ready for a test or (of course) a sporting event but I definitely see it as limited listening any other time. Got this album on sale. Wouldn't pay full price for it.
5,Great,Wanted it for a wedding it was great. Lots of good dance songs to get people on the dance floor.
4,March Madness Party,I purchased the CD Jock Jams CD for a March Madness Party that I held for over 100 people and it truly was the hit or hits of the evening. Especially the first two tracks Let's Get Ready to Rumble. It had the people pumped. All the people said the party was great and all said the music set the tone. Thanks!
4,So Close,"This CD has some of the best sports songs ever on it. Like ""Let's get ready to rumble"", ""Get Ready 4 This"", ""Strike it Up"" and ""Rock N Roll"", among others. But you have to wonder what songs like ""Unbelievable"" and ""Ive got the Power"" are doing on there. This CD came so close but didn't quite make it."
5,Slamming!,"If you love old school terror core from the 90's then this is a great album to pick up if you can still find it. The only thing that would make it better is if it was a mixed set instead of individual tracks. But it's still awesome. Great for partying with your old school raver friends, or when you need some high energy sound for writing code. Or whatever your thing is. If you can find it. Buy it!"
2,Unhappy - Author did not do full review before writing,The book tells a story but there where at the time of creation two living participants that were never spoken too. I know this for a fact because Sarah Hunt (not Clara as stated in the book) is my grandmother and the infant that she was feeding is my dad. Since the publishing of this book my grandmother has passed away but my father is still alive and living in the Oneonta area and has never been spoken too.My grandmother's name was miss spelled and I feel before a book like this is published all people involved should have been spoken with. From my father's view there are many things and situations that are incorrect in this book.
4,good solid Book,"Im sorry but you shouldn't be reading this book if you cant find the ""all components off"" toggle, this book is made for a user who is beyond a beginner lever and more familiar with Maya and how it works. It lays down a good foundation on how to rig a character properly, for more advanced rigging I suggest a lot of experimenting on your own, there is no sing resource that will give you everything on a silver platter"
2,ONLY good for George Lamond that's it,"Skip this one and stick to the earlier collections. Volume 1, 2 and 5. Unless you are completist this compilation is not worth $14. If you see it for like $6.99 then go for it. This compo is more 90's style and I am an 80's man. Basically I recommend sounds from 1984 - 1989."
5,This is an amazing cookbook!,"Because this cookbook is presented almost as a calendar, the recipes are not only cultural but seasonal. I have tried many of the recipes and they are delicious--try it."
5,absolute best,"This ambiant/techno CD is BY FAR the best i've ever listened to. It's not that kind of space/new-age ambiant and not too much techno. It's just perfect ! Even if you don't like techno. Quite all the CD is mixed from track to track. Just turn on the volume, listen, relax, enjoy !"
4,You Can't Go Wrong with Max and Ruby,Great book. My kids love Max's mischief. I have 4 children and I was an early childhood teacher for 10 yrs. Max and Ruby stories are loved by all.
5,Ruby & Max Play Beauty Shop,"Simple, sweet picture book with another great adventure for Ruby and her brother Max as they play Beauty Shop-- beautifying themselves, their friend, Louise, and Grandma. Louise comes over with her deluxe Beauty Kit. Max wants to open the Beauty Kit, but the girls say, ""No, you are our first customer!"" With wigs, stick-nails, mousse, and make-up, the girls have fun with Max. Then they make over themselves. Too busy with their own creations, Max discovers the hair color and adds Lizard Green to dye his white fur. Sunflower Yellow goes on one foot and Ocean Blue on the other. Max answers the phone. It's Grandma, and the girls want to beautify her. But Grandma makes her first appointment with Max. Grandmas will identify with the Blond Bombshell wig and the beehive hairdo from the 50s and 60s. Kids will just get a kick out of the story."
3,Too Familiar,"I bought this CD mainly because the sticker on the cover stated that the Generators played ""melodic punk rock for fans of Bad Religion and Social Distortion."" If you're going to name-drop, those are the two punk bands that are most likely to catch my attention.Well, it's obvious right from the start that this band is heavily influenced by Bad Religion and Social Distortion. Too much so, perhaps. The band's ""by the numbers"" approach may keep their style recognizable, but it seems to be missing that fire and energy that makes similar (though unique in their own ways) bands like Avail, Millencolin, and Welt so much fun to listen to.The best rating I can give The Winter of Discontent is 3-stars. It's a decent melodic punk album, but I expected better. I don't mind when a band's influences are clearly on display, but there has to be something more that makes the band stand out, and I'm just not seeing it here."
3,Stupid CD Great Seller,"I bought this CD because I needed a few songs on it, but over all it is silly and stupid. But the Seller was wonderful. The package was proper and secured the CD and the service was fast."
5,Upbeat,"Vol 1 and the other CDs in this series are all time favorite, sing along, party songs. If you plan on dancing this is not the CD to buy. If you plan on just hanging out with friends then you are buying the right CD."
3,no title,...i got this cd and i just want to tell you that it's a great cdif you like your oldies but if you want some music that will get you totally [psyched] then i sugest that you get Jock jams Volume 3 (cotten eyed Joe is my fav)i had that but i lost it and right now i'm missing it it's a great cd also if you want to try something new get pure disco 2 of pure funk
4,"Believe it or not, the title is apt!","I was hesitant because of the title, but was surprised at how consistently good this comp was. For me, crust bands tend to wear thin after half a record. This comp has a good flow. Each band is definitively crust, but their subtle differences make this an easy and enjoyable listen... if such a thing is possible. Get It."
4,Unique Watch.,"I purchased this watch about 3 months ago and have been wearing it off and on in rotation. It is a very elegant an unique looking watch. You will likely never see another watch that displays the time in such a way. That being said it is not easy to simply glance at the watch and tell what time it is. It is more art over usefulness. It has a nice brushed metal look that always gets compliments and a cool second hand that has the 5 second numerals except for 19 and 48 (replacing 20 and 50).The band looks great but I am not a fan of the button push clasp, it is easy to disengage with mild activity. So dinner or sitting at a desk yes. Clapping (sporting event) or doing work around the house no.In review. 5 stars for the watch itself. Keeps accurate time. (But only time) and looks splendid.3 stars for the band, Looks good but the clasp is frustrating."
4,I Married Adventure review,"Though I am biased, since Osa Johnson was my grandfather's aunt, I have read this book a couple of times and have always found it to be well-written and easy to relate to. Osa was a woman ahead of her time, driving a truck, hunting fowl for dinner, and planting a garden with the help of hired African men, only to see it trampled by elephants. This story really gives a clear picture of what it was like to be one of very few American women traveling in undeveloped parts of the world in the 1920s and 30s."
1,Did not ship what is pictured,"The picture posted for this item is the original ""Zebra"" style book cover. What was sent to me is an edition of the book that was published in the 1980's. Not a zebra cover design."
1,Overdone!,"Only one star for Waltz for Debbie? This is a sublime album and deserves all the accolades it gets but Orrin Keepnews managed to blow it. Not only does he add three alternate takes but instead of tacking them on at the end he plays them in succession and then runs those three back to back. Thus we hear Waltz for Debbie-Waltz for Debbie-Detour Ahead-Detour Ahead-My Romance-My Romance, each about seven minutes long. Using the ""Random Play"" option doesn't help because the ratio of alternate takes is so high your just as likely to hear the same track three or four times in a row. Musicians wouldn't play a set like this. The album was perfect at about 45 minutes."
2,Masterpiece? Why?,"Jazz fans praise this album tooo much.I guess Evans and Lafaro are so great, I totally agree.However, Motian, one of the worst drummerever......He messed up this album.LAME"
3,Distortion,"Unfortunately, on this CD and its companion, SUNDAY AT THE VILLAGE VANGUARD, the piano is plagued by distortion.I tried to pick out the songs with less distortion for the purpose of making a mix, but I realized I would always be listening for distortion, so I put them away.It's a pity, because the session took place ten days before Scott LaFaro's death, and the recording of his bass is superb.If you're willing to overlook the buzzing of the distortion in the piano, buy them both. The musicianship is extraordinary."
2,5 stars music-- 2 stars sound,"i LOVE this collection.in fact, i'd got so far as to say i can't go very long without listening to it. the music is amazing..the crying shame of it IS-- the piano is SO distorted in transients, that i can't listen to it without cringing. it's so clear and great on bass and drums.. you feel immersed in the space. but... bill evans' piano is farting out in so many places.. it's really sorta atrocious. i thought there was something wrong with my system-- literally. but it's the discs..i really don't know if it's the masters, or the mastering.. but sadly.. either way.. it kinda bombs. if you listen in the car or as a background.. this is a fantastic set. if you REALLY sit and listen.. i'm really sad to say, this ain't your collection!"
5,Every myth enkernals a truth.,"For jazz cognoscenti, this recording captures a seminal moment in the evolution of jazz, Bill Evans' career, and that of the subsequently legendary Scott Faro. You don't need to know the details to appreciate it. Your appreciation only can be enhanced once you hear the story and, even, read a poem inspired by the performance of ""I Loves You, Porgy."" By all means, purchase this recording without reservation."
1,This Subwoofer output is Weak,"This Subwoofer output is Weak, I had the dial at maximum settings and it is still sounds weak."
3,dish cloths,these are sturdy enough but they changed color when they were washed. Some of them are still green while others changed to yellow
4,DOWN IN THE DELTA,"Dan Dane spins a fine yarn about sharecroppers' lives on plantations in eastern Arkansas. Through his accurate depiction of black laborers and white landowners, the reader will learn the true meaning of the lyrics from a popular song of the forties, ""I owe my soul to the company store.""Dane, a lawyer with experience in the judicial system of the Delta, compares today's law enforcement agencies that tie poor blacks to them by using the blacks as snitches to avoid jail time with the plantation owners who held black farm workers hostage to the general store."
5,Great 2nd album by Coolio,"This was Coolio's first album after the phenominal It Takes A Thief. It was boosted by the smash-hit Gangsta's Paradise and made Coolio a huge name. The album is packed with catchy beats and tight lyrics. My best song on the album is Get Up Get Down guest starring WC which is ill. Other great songs are A Thing Goin' On, Exercise Yo' Game and Is This Me. I say check this album out if you are a fan of Coolio or even better check out his great debut, It Takes A Thief for some real old-school hip hop... Later"
4,Gangsta's Paradise,"Gangsta's Paradise is an album that was released in 1995. One of the title tracks was also released on the Dangerous Minds soundtrack. This album was a major hit back in 1995. So much that Coolio was awarded a Grammy for the song/album.If you are looking for an upbeat CD with good song selections (rap), this is the CD for you."
3,Good,Gangsta's Paradise is a great song. Rest of the album is just average( exept Too Hot and Kind High Kinda Drunk). Good album but nothing special. Coolio can do better.
3,"Coolio - ""gangsta's paradise""","This album is good, especially ""Gangsta's paradise"". Some tracks are of poor quality but it is mostly very good. It would be so much better if you didn't have all the swearing."
4,Good rap cd,"Now, I'm not a big Coolio fan. But I've just always liked the song ""Gangsta's Paradise"". Even though that's the initial reason I bought the album, there are many more good songs on it. I like the song ""Ghetto Highlights"" almost as much as the title track. ""Sumpin New(1,2,3,4)"" is a pretty catchy tune I used to hear at roller skate places a lot. Those are my 3 favorite songs, but I also like the songs ""Kinda High, Kinda Drunk"" and ""Exercise Yo' Game"". The only reason I took off a star is because since this is an edited album, there are a couple of songs that could be good that are edited so much, it takes away from the songs."
3,could be better,"this CD isn't bad but it could be better. It needs more songs and it needs better songs. The only song I really liked was gangstas paradise. I really don't know why they made an edited vesion. Coolio doesn't curse much. Oh well... Buy the unedited version!!!!(or Tupac, 50 cent, Eminem, or Chingy)."
3,A couple stand out songs.,"I bought this album mainly for GANGSTA'S PARADISE. I've never been a huge Coolio fan, but I liked the song. There were a couple of other good songs on the album, especially the one with the guest appearance by WC (the Shadiest!). The lyrics and the beats on that were pretty tight. The rest of the album was enjoyable, but nothing outstanding. The lyrics were nothing special and the production was mediocre...he needed more work from Crazy Toones.This album isn't a must have unless you're a Coolio fan, but it's enjoyable."
1,If it's sooooo good how come it's selling right now used for 1 ?,"Because suckers by it, quickly get bored by it, then try to sell it.Except there are more suckers than buyers.Gangsta indeed. Only an idiot thinks gangsta's are good at making music.OK the dumbos who disagree can now press the ""not helpful"" button, and the smart people can, at least, consider what I've written."
3,message from coolio,"not the best from coolio the compton o.g. but also not the worsest cd in hip hop either the cd is worth bumpin, but my favorite is get up get down with cameo's from 40 thevs and the only reason i wanted to hear the cd was because i wanted to hear a guest spot from wc,and glad to see i was'nt let down."
3,"Loved ""Gangsta's Paradise""!!","""Gangsta's Paradise"" is getting to be a quite old rap song...but it's still probably one of the best ever. It definitely goes on the top of my all-time favorite rap songs list. I gave this CD 3 stars because ""Gangsta's Paradise"" is the only song I've heard off this album. I'm sure the rest of the album is pretty decent, too. But ""Gangsta's Paradise"" will probably always be one of the best rap songs! If you love Coolio's music, than this is a really great CD and you must have it. Otherwise, if you only like ""Gangsta's Paradise"", then I suggest buying the CD-single for it or the soundtrack for DANGEROUS MINDS. Totally awesome song. Probably Coolio's best. I just love it!!"
2,Disappointed,The Skull Beneath the SkinWay too much minutiae and not enough written on the plot to keep my interest. Very disappointed but will give P. D. James another try with Cover Her Face featuring Adam Dalglish. You can't beat Agatha Christie for being the queen of description in one short paragraph while James takes pages to show us a setting.
3,"Good plot, crazy detective","I liked the plot, found it interesting and compelling, but found it very difficult to identify with or even understand some of the choices the main character makes later in the book, which diminished my enjoyment of the book very much."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I have always enjoyed the P.D. James books. I have read nearly all the Adam Dogleash series. This book was a huge waste of time. It was a combination of ""Then There Were None,"" and a Massie Dobbs book. It was so predictable.A women detective with an agency in London is supposed to protect an actress who will be giving a preformance at a Castle on an island. First there is one murder than two and of course you know where this is going.I am surprised that P.D. James wrote this."
2,Why does Baroness James hate women?,"Sad to say, ""Skull Beneath the Skin"" is another misogynistic scar on P.D. James's body of work, with a soulless, career-obsessed sex fiend who meets her well-deserved end. What is James's problem? She's a career woman, whether she likes it or not, but she seems to have a pathological hatred for career women who put out, unlike the saintly Emma. Perhaps she's just getting old. ""Skull"" has some of James's trademark character development and plotting skill, but even her gift for landscape falls short in this outing -- the island and its inhabitants never seem remotely believable. Try ""Death in Holy Orders"" for James without the nasty streak."
1,Terrible,"I had to read this book for my high school summer reading. It was one of the worst books i have ever read. Everytime I sat down to read it i fell asleep. When the end finally came i was very dissapointed because nothing happened. Clarissa died and everyone left the island, nobody was convicted of her murder. Pointless and terrible."
1,In serious need of an editor...,"This book should be required reading in technical writing classes as an example of how *not* to write. Not only is the writing style poor (runons, poor cutting and pasting) but there are logical errors abounding as well. And I didn't even manage to get through the introductory chapter..."
1,"Ambitious title, but poor content","I was very enthusiastic to see the seal of the WWISA on this book. I had read their book titled ""Software Architecture - Organizational Principles and Patterns"" and thought this book would be just as useful.I was wrong.I stopped reading this book after the first chapter. The book lacked a focus. I jumped to a chapter in the middle of the book and found the same problem.This book needs more focus, better diagrams and more streamlined approach towards systems architecture."
1,Use this to get references to what you should read,You can find a cheaper way to get references on what you should study to be an architect. Unfortunatly this book tries to cover too much and only gives superficial overviews of the subjects.
1,This is religion!,"I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunatly the authors were unable to rise above the technology/process wars. The words ""In Our Opinion"" or simalar statements occur on every other page. If you happen to be in disagreement with the opinions reading this book is torture.I am afraid this will hurt WWISA, the goal of creating a viable Software Architecture Profession can only be achieved if we stay independent of the wars. This book, being visable evidence of the organiztions existance will give readers a false impression of the WWISA."
1,Huge disappointment,"A book on software architecture should discuss a number of approaches to architecting software: layers, business objects, pipelines, frameworks, etc. This book has a few ideas, but mostly it's a tiresome diatribe against Microsoft technologies (2 million professional developers should switch just because this author and Scott McNeally says so!), and a verbose marketing brochure for CORBA, Linux, and the Usual wanna-be-as-succesful-as-Microsoft Suspects!"
5,"Great! ""Architect in a Box""","As a newly crowned enterprise software architect, I needed a complete ""Architect in a Box"" kit, and this book is it. Learn what software architecture is, why it is becoming so popular, where it started, where it is going, and how to do it well. A must have on any software architect's desk."
1,"Interesting idea, but badly executed","Software Architect Bootcamp offers a good selection of topics and an interesting organizational metaphor. Unfortunately, this title doesn't fulfill its promise, suffering from poor writing, ineffective use of illustrations and examples and a dismal quality of editorial work."
3,"Terrible editing but the ""right"" message",If you need an example of how to not write or edit a book this is it. What saves it is at least the architecture is based on contemporary thinking and not the latest pap out of Redmond. That alone makes it tolerable. Of course the RUP centric view and emphasis on CORBA are strong points. If you're out to learn architecture (as in go to bootcamp) at least study the solid features of architectures and methodologies. Leave the For Dummies series to the MS worshipers and architect [....]
3,Very uneven,"The book starts out great, talking about the architect role and what an architect should and shouldn't do. After a dozen pages or so, it dives into a prolonged and repetitive discussion of COM+ vs CORBA, mislabeled as ""Basic Training"". Towards the end of the book, the author returns to relevant subjects and makes many excellent observations on the human factors to consider when doing architecture work."
1,Defective By Design,"The DualDisc format was too thick for my notebook drive and would not play in any of my home players (two standalone players and three computers) or my car's 6-disc CD changer. I found a DVD player to listen to the other side of the disc, which was scratched after trying to insert it into my notebook's drive, and the album was unimpressive. I am white, nerdy, and a Wierd Al fan since the very first album, but I found the parodies just OK, most of the original comedy pedestrian, and what's left was simply irritating. I gave up trying to rip it to my iPod, and I am NOT buying the songs AGAIN on iTunes. Why they chose not to put Orange Book audio on the defective DualDisc format is beyond me. Since I can't use what I bought, and I can't return it, I'll swap it for a not-scratched copy... and you can find that one on the auctions."
3,Tough rating,"I'm a huge Weird Al fan, blah blah blah, I have all his stuff, blah blah blah. You don't want to hear that from me, you want a review. This is a tough one because I like so much of his previous stuff. Unfortunately, I don't like this one much but it may grow on me. The good stuff - White & Nerdy, Confessions III (surprisingly funny since I don't care for Usher), and Weasel Stomping Day. The bad... almost the rest, I'm still undecided on Trapped in the Drive Thru but leaning towards liking the stupidity of it which is trademark Al. The dual disk helped save a star on this rating. Sadly, I'm letdown by the other songs when there was just so much he could have really jabbed at (Lumps: Black Eye Peas, Down With the Sickness: Disturbed, and Honkytonk Badonkadonk: Trace Adkins, and even a song for LOST were begging for parodies).Overall, it will probably grow on me, but after listening to it a few times so far, I think it's subpar to his other stuff."
1,Download this album,"I am a big Al fan and i wish i could tell you this album is great but i can't because I can't play it. This is not a dual disc set it is a double sided disc with a DVD with videos on one side and an ""audio side ...does not conform to CD Specifications"" on the other. I went to load it into my ipod and none of my drives will read it. Buy it from Itunes if you even have the thought of playing it on a computer or Ipod."
4,Glad to hear Al back in top form.,"The parodies are very well done here. ""White And Nerdy"" is easily the funniest song I've heard in a really long time. Even the songs that aren't parodies borrow styles from other bands; ""Close but no cigar"" sounds like Cake and ""I'll Sue Ya"" sounds like Rage Against The Machine. Very well done."
4,"Better Than Poodle Hat, But......","This album is better than Poodle Hat. The originals are better written and seem like more thought was put into them (in comparison to ""Poodle Hat""), with the exception of ""Pancreas."" I don't understand the point of that song. The rest are for the most part, great. All fresh and recent parodies, as usual.I have a problem with the DVD aspect though. I can view it fine, from my DVD-ROM drive or my DVD Players, but the videos are all animated, not factory produced motion-picture videos which was I was hoping to see. The behind-the-scenes portion of Al and his crew making the album are good, but the videos.....who's idea was it to put these poor man's attempt of music video filmmaking on the DVD side?"
1,beat up,the cd side barly worked took a lot of tries to get my computer to download it and the video side is to scratched up to play
3,Shows how much rock is dead,"The cd's alright. But there's a huge lack of variety on this album. At least 85% of the album is hiphop and R&B. There's only one parody of a rock song, ""Canadian Idiot."" And it's alright. He seemed to have tried to make up for it in the Polka song with more alternative songs.. but that just doesn't do it for me. As for the funniness of the lyrics itself, just like any other Al cd.. it's only funny the first time you listen to it. And I don't feel any of these songs have the same sort of listen longevity (You can listen to it after years and years and still have same affect), like ""Yoda"" and ""Eat it."" Most of his original tracks are about relationships/women.. which just got old. What happend to the food and TV themes? Basically.. I think Al could've did better, the lack of variety really killed this album for me. Though, the album is worth listening to.. once."
2,WeirD Al Lynwood album,We're Weird Al fans but this album wasn't as great as other albums. I think one problem is the fact that the music itself just isn't as good as other albums he has done. We're still loyal fans though!!! It just proves my conclusion that ALL musicians and composers put out not-so-great stuff too along with the gems.
2,Dualdisc not so hot:(,"The album sounds like it's great, and the DVD features are cool...but I can't play it in my completely normal CD/DVD drive - not either side. And I listen to music mostly on the computer. This really should have been offered in a normal edition:("
4,"Its Funny, hopefully it will stay that way...","I not a gigantic fan of Wierd Al, since he can become a victim of his own success (anybody want to hear ""Eat It"" again, ever?) but I heard ""Weasel Stomping Day"" on Cartoon Network's Robot Chicken show and I was laughing out loud. Hopefully cuts from this CD won't get played to death because its worth a listen."
5,Simply great!,"This is by far Weird Al's funniest and truly best smelling album, second only to the book ""Instru-Mental"" from the Adventures With Boys book series!"
2,"A few funny lines, but not up to the level of his earlier stuff","The only really funny song here is ""I'll Sue Ya"". A few of the others have humorous lines, but don't hold up all the way through.In spite of Al's song ""Don't Download This Song"", that's the best way to get this album because you'll only want to hear it a coupla times, at most, then file it away."
2,Not Impressed,"I have every single album that Weird Al has ever made. And I am not impressed by this one at all. It lacks variety, and is overall boring and not creative. I enjoy white and nerdy and weasel stomping day, but Close But No Cigar and Trapped In The Drive-Thru (waaay too long) are just crappy. And Pancreas? WTF??"
2,Don't waste your money,"The parodies are comical, but I don't like the style of music. I don't think it's near up to the same level as his past albums. I think he is running out of steam, and trying too hard."
2,Not as great as they say,"I've been a Weird Al fan for some time now and after reading all the reviews here on amazon I was really excited to hear his newest release. Unfortunately, the album does not justify the hype. White & Nerdy is an impressive starting song, but pancreas is a bit of a let down, it just feels like he's done a song or two just like it on past albums. Candian Idiot is alright, but I'll Sue Ya is a really boring and poor excuse for a Rage Against The Machine (style) paradoy. Polkarama was alright. Virus Alert was kinda funny. Convessions Part III is about as exciting as the R&B song that it parody's. Weasel Stomping Day is stupid and a little gross. Close But No Cigar is completely forgettable. Do I Creep You Out was pretty good. I liked it. The rest of the songs were decent and I haven't watched the bonus items but I doubt they can make up for so many disappointing songs."
3,Close but no cigar blew it,"I have been a 'Weird Al' fan for about two years or so and I can say. This was a fun album. Creative and entertaining. For the songs I give five stars. The DVD part I give five. BUT.. My complaint is that the video for 'Close But No Cigar' was too bad. It was not really him so to speak. A little on the CD, works fine except it skipped 0:54 through 0:57 of 'White & Nerdy' it is just a pause. The DVD worked fine too. I think that this is good but the song ""CBNC' is sort of explicit.Happy Weasel Stomping Day!"
2,Looks like people are starting to catch on ...,"I did a review of Weird Al's last album (Poodle Hat), where I said that I thought Al was losing his edge. Now it seems that more people are starting to agree with me, as you see multiple reviews here where people are saying ""it's just not funny anymore."" Some people say that Bad Hair Day was Al's last really good album, but it say it goes further back to Off The Deep End.As for this album, I gotta give it 2 stars because of White & Nerdy, which is probably the best thing Al has done since Headline News. Other than that, the rest of the album isn't much to write home about. I think the problem is that many of the songs are more 'clever' than they are funny.I'm sorry to say, but it Al's music just isn't what it used to be. Better luck next time, I guess."
2,Pretty Disappointed,"I have followed Weird Al from the start. I have enjoyed every single one of his albums ... until now.His comic brilliance didn't show through this time, and this album crossed over from funny to stupid. I only enjoyed two of the twelve songs on this entire album, both of which have been made available for free download. I honestly recommend that you go to his website and download those two tracks. Don't waste money on this CD, because it is overall pretty disappointing.Why am I rating it 2/5 stars? The answer is that it just isn't funny any more. There used to be a suble genius about Weird Al, that made me listen to his albums over and over again. But this CD isn't even good for laughs the first time.Thanks for reading my review. Even if you do not agree with me, please take a moment to say that this review was helpful."
2,"I'm sure its a great CD, but the format is terrible","The songs are great, I've already heard some. However, the dual disc format won't allow me to upload the songs to iTunes. Now I'll probably have to buy it on iTunes if I want to listen to it on my computer."
4,Newest Weird Al CD,"I purchased this as a gift for my hubby who thinks ""Al"" is hysterical- and I gotta say - he is. After listening to it all the way to my in-laws on Christmas Day, and laughing at the songs, this guy has a great knack for making catchy songs out of the craziest things. I love that he basically is telling some artists to stop taking theirselves so serious- He combines two things I love- music and laughing... and to see my husband laugh is even better !! He loves to listen to it if he's having a bad day just to chill out. Keep making us laugh Al !!!"
3,Weird Al's first...,"...Don't gotta have!The big single ""White and Nerdy"" is Very Fun. however, it's also the only video not on the disk. This Song, and the DualDisk as the principal release are why Al earned the star rating from me.I've been a Weird Al fan since album 1... by my taste he almost totally missed with this one; but I don't enjoy Hip-hop. The only gotta have on the album is ""White and Nerdy"" although with true Al style, both Weasel Stomping Day and Don't Download This Song (Which you can download for free on several sites) are classically infectious, irreverent and addictive. If they were packaged on a single, I could have gotten away with buying that.I honestly can't remember the rest of the material. Not even after running the disk through both my DVD and CD players a half dozen times.On the plus side: Kudos on the Dual Disk for under $20! Thank you Thank you Thank you. I get to have the videos bundled with the album.Very Very Smart."
3,"Weird Al, still going strong","Loved most of the songs on this CD, even if more and more of them seem to be parodies of music I don't listen to. The videos were fun too. I look forward to getting some more of Weird Al's music in the near future."
4,Good but not the best,"A keeper for those who collect Weird Al. For the rest, not sure. Al shows flashes of brilliance, but there's some pretty pedestrian stuff on this disc too. It's no ""Even Worse""."
5,BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT,The funniest group of songs i have ever listened to. The video quality is really good. buy it buy it buy it buyit buy it buy it buy it buy it
4,good old Al,"Al is in usual good form however I haven't really been crazy about either of his last 2 albums..""White & Nerdy"" is really good & ""I'll Sue Ya"" is a funny ""in the style of"" Rage Against the Machine.. It's good AL but maybe not hilarious AL."
5,always hysterical,"If you have never seen Jeff Dunham, do yourself this favor. He is extremely talented and hysterical!"
5,Jeff Dunham - Arguing with Myself,"As usual, Jeff & Crew are great. My wife and I were introduced to Jeff about 20 years ago, and have made multiple trips to see him LIVE at the Improv in DC & Baltimore Md., spending at least $150 per night. This DVD is the best thing you could spend $$$$$ on. I would buy this DVD even if the price was $75, so I could share the experence with all my friends and family. I am creating a Christmas list of at least 10 of these DVD's. I would rate this DVD as a 10 if possible."
5,Hilarious,Our whole family loved this DVD. We shared it with our friends and they all thought it was great also. Very funny without having all the swearing that a lot of the comedians use in their shows today.
5,Jeff Dunham - Arguing With Myself,After seeing Jeff in person I had to buy this DVD and was very pleased. It's laugh out loud funny and the out takes are great it's almost as good as being there live . Would highly recomend.
1,Funny as hell,"The funniest part of this act is the one star reviews on Amazon. One star for the act., four stars for the comments."
2,"Funny, but needs to be R-rated","This is funny, but it had too much sexual humor. It should be R rated. I would not watch it again or recommend it."
5,You will laugh yourself to tears!!,This guy is so funny and his 5 characters are a blast!! He is a master at ventriliquism for sure. I may buy a bunch more to give as gifts. There is an option on the dvd to have the censored or unsensored version to satisfy the audiences taste...very nice. You have to buy it....it is very funny!!
5,Jeff Dunham Arguing with Myself,"This is a hilarious video with a guy that ""plays with dolls."" He is a vantriliquist and he is very funny and very talented. If you buy this video you will be very pleased"
5,Jeff Dunham Spark of Insanity,"WE adored the two DVDs of Jeff Dunham and FRIENDS, they put smiles on our lips and Laughter in our hearts and our Home..Whole family is sharing these DVDS and everyone loves them... Walter is so familiar, can't place where I know him from but.........Hope there are more shows coming from thiese Talented ""People""!!! Thank you Jeff"
5,Jeff Dunham AWESOME Funny,If you like to laugh and like comedy anybody from young to old will love thisman and his puppets. He is just GREAT! The Larghe's
4,Jeff Dunham Arguing With Myself,"This was good, all of Jeff's stuff is good, but in comparison to the Insanity DVD, this wasn't nearly as funny. Get this dvd for a couple of laughs, but definitely get the Spark of Insanity one, it's awesome."
4,Jeff Dunham - Arguing With Myself,"I love ventriloquists and Jeff Dunham is at the top of the class. His variety of characters allow him to cover a large spectrum on life in today's chaotic world. It is always amazing when the ventriloquist is this good how easy it is to ""feel"" that the puppet is alive! The ventriloquist plays the innocent as he speaks the outrageous through his puppet/alter egos, disclaiming any responsibility for their abusive, rude behavior. Jeff Dunham is a very funny man. Enjoy, Bro. Mac"
5,You won't be able to stop laughing,This DVD is great and I wasn't able to stop laughing. Jeff really has an interesting perspective on every day happenings and puts his hilarious spin on it. I highly recommend this one.
5,Jeff Dunham Arguing with myself,"Love the man. Love his humor, his creativity, would absolutely adore seeing him in person some day. Cracks me up. :)"
4,Review,"Jeff Dunham is super talented. Arguing with myself shows that talent. I love walter, peanut, and the gang. I think he spends too much time with the terrorist clip though."
5,Lots of laughs,Jeff Durham is certainly not politically correct but he is funny. I would recommend this to DVD to anyone who wants a good laugh.
5,comedy relief,"jeff dunham, walter and the wole gang is absolutly hilarious. more than well worth the money it was bought for."
4,"Rolling on the floor, laughing","This DVD is great! Jeff Dunham is the best ventriloquist out there! I never laughed so hard. I had seen him perform several times in the past at our local comedy club and he never fails to deliver. If you can't see him live, GET THIS DVD!!!"
4,"Dunham's Great, this edition is Very good","Get the DVD just for Walter, Peanut, and jose. there are two others that are not nearly as good (which is probably why they are no longer in the act).there is an option for bleeped and un-bleeped which is good, and the ability to chapter-choose which puppet you want to see is priceless!This is one of the best comedians out there, with three of his best friends ever!"
5,One Funny Guy,"Not only is Jeff a great ventriloquist but he's very, very funny and to think he creates and makes all these characters is just way out there. He's a natural comic. We recently watched one of his DVD's at a club campout and were all nearly in tears before he finished. Fantastic."
5,Arguing with Myself by Jeff Dunham,Purchased the DVD after seeing Jeff Dunham's act on the Comedy Channel. He and his characters are hysterical. My favorite is Walter; next favorite is Achmed. I received my purchase timely and in perfect shape.
5,Medic 67,Perfect inexpensive gift for birthday or christmas. Everyone needs a laugh once in a while and who better than Jeff Dunham.
5,Another Christmas gift,My nephew enjoyes this very much as well and has watched it numerous time. Jeff is verry funny and makes the characters come alive...
5,Best Ever,This was the funniest stand-up comedian in the whole world. Great jokes. I was entertained from start to finish!!!
5,Worth every minute!,"I love Jeff and all his pals. I just could not stop laughing. I have watched this several times since I purchased it, I wish he had a few more of his specials on dvd. If you want a great laugh than I would reccommend this dvd."
4,Jeff Dunham-Arguing With Myself,This is hilarious!!!! There is a bleeped and unbleeped selection which is helpful but still says curse words just not real vulger ones.
5,Great comedy,"When I showed this to other couples, they ordered a combine total of 12 copies. That says it all. It's a skit you can watch over and over and still laugh."
5,Great Entertainment,Great Entertainment. This is an unwind show. Get in your favorite chair with your snacks and unwind. You can watch this show more than once.
5,Jeff Dunham - Arguing With Myself,"What can I say? This DVD is fantastic and I have watched it at least 100 times since purchasing it--I have also dubbed the audio portion onto CD so that I might be able to listen to it in the car and at work!! I have loved watching Jeff Dunham perform for a long time. I recently got to see him in person and was thrilled with his performance!! I would like to be able to see him perform at Kuss Auditorium in Springfield, Ohio if at all possible. One of his newest characters, Sweet Daddy D, is the epitome of my Black brothers!! If anyone who sees this DVD doesn't find themselves laughing their heads off, then you must not have a sense of humor. Also, hearing Jeff do Sweet Daddy D is the first time that I knew what the word ""PIMP"" really means!! He is good at what he does and I hope he continues to do it for many years to come. Kudos to you, Jeff, for a job well done."
5,Stupendous!!!!!,"This DVD was simply outstanding!!! A true must-see for anyone who likes comedy of any kind!!! I would recommend it to anyone, even my 75-year-old mother, who loved it as well!!!"
5,Funny!,I have shared Arguing With Myself with many family members and friends and it is popular with one and all. Peanut and Walter are especially delightful. I do not like the interruptions of Sweet Daddy Dee from the green room and such. I thought those bits added nothing and were distracting from the flow of the show.
3,Funny but not for kids,"After seeing his Insanity tour, I thought this DVD of Jeff Dunham would be a good one for the entire family. Ouch. The language is definitely not kid-friendly although, on second look, it does have a ""bleep"" version. Still, all the bleeps take away from what would otherwise be a great routine. He's funny. I'm not a prude but he'd definitely be funnier if he'd clean up the language."
5,Just Plain Funny,Jeff is a comic genies. His routines are just darn funny. How he manages his routine is brilliant. Funniest guy I have ever seen.
5,Laughter!!!,"If you want to laugh, set back in your chair and put a Jeff Dunham DVD in.. they're fantastic!!!!"
4,Great Ventriloquist! Super funny.,This is a great video - just be aware it does not feature the unibomber. Jeff is the funniest ventriloquist I have ever seen.
5,I Will Never Blink,"I don't have the DVD but I've seen the show on comedy central. I love it, it is hilarious and I think I could look at it again and again and not get tired of it. A barrel of laughs."
5,Great Laugh For The Adults,"Jeff Dunham is absolutely wonderful. My parents and I walk around our house quoting him. The best part is he relates to the audience pulls his ""jokes"" from his experiences."
5,Hold a pillow to your stomach while you laugh,"We're still laughing over a month later. Jeff's loveable puppets are so engaging, you might forget he's a ventriloquist."
1,"Jeff Dunham is an Unfunny Racist, Like His Fans","There is nothing good about Jeff Dunham or anything he does. He is probably the least funny ""comedian"" that has ever reached that level of stardom. It makes me physically ill to listen to his thinly-veiled racist jokes. I use the word jokes pretty liberally there, it's really just ""who's the dummy"" brand schtick with a bunch of catch phrases thrown in from the racist stereotype characters he has created. The fact that he has achieved such a level of success makes me weep for the American viewing public that swallows this ugliness up and begs for more."
3,Disappointed,I don't know what I was expecting - more than what was offered I guess. It was cute but not spectacular. Would not recommend.
2,A Comedy Must See!!!!!,"If you love comdey, you will love Jeff Dunham's ""Jeff Dunham - Arguing With Myself"". Even if you seen it on Comedy Central, you will want to own your own copy so you can watch Walter and Peanut and the others over and over. We love our copy and have shared it with others. This DVD is too funny to miss. Jeff reaches out to all ages and all kinds of people every where."
1,Watch your language!,"We were watching this DVD with anther couple and we turned it off before we were half way through. The language in it is atrocious! Why do comedians think they have to use all that bad language to be funny. We could use more comedians like Red Skelton and Bill Cosby! I had Jeff's other DVD on order but canceled immediately after watching what I did of this one. Sorry, but didn't think the language is called for."
1,Not for me or my family,"Watched it for 10 minutes, took it out of the player and immediately filed in the trash with the rest of the garbage."
4,Very funny,"I didn't like his two new characters at all. I still love the old man, peanut and jalapeno on a steeeek. They are still my all time favorites."
4,Jeff Dunham,"This dvd was purchased for my son as a birthday present because he is a fan of Jeff Dunham. Jeff Dunham is a great comedian, he is very funny and you have to love all his characters. His is a great ventriloquist."
4,You'll laugh your socks off!,"Absolutely loved this video! It's one of his earlier releases, so Achmed is NOT part of the line-up of puppets. We've since viewed his newer ones and loved all of them."
5,Such an accurate and amusing title,"I can't get enough of Dunham and his multi-talented performances. He has created and portrays such marvelous characters. Walter, Achmed, and Peanut are my favorites, but I love them all. I have all his live performances, TV series, and special comedy shows on DVD's, and I will never part with them. Waiting for his new one, Diane, to show ""her stuff."" Any or all of these make great gifts. Jeff, I'm so glad I discovered you and bought your DVD's."
4,Juff Dunham-Arguing with Myself,As always Jeff Dunham is very entertaining. I was very pleased with the content of this video. I would recommend this purchase to anyone.
4,great video,great video to watch and I like walter and my wife loves peanut we alugh everytime we watch it great for the family
5,Great,"Jeff Dunham's DVD's are great, they will keep you laughing, I have 6 of them so far. It only took a few days to get to me"
1,Horrible,"One of the worst ""comedy"" acts; his success is baffling and another sign as we march towards the future of Idiocracy."
1,It won't let me rate 0 stars,"The fact that this has a 5 star rating makes me worry so much about America. He is a horrid ventriloquist, and an even worse comedian. It's like he is just trying to see how many terrible stereotypes he can fit into each terrible program, while someone managing not to be the least bit edgy. This sucks funny out of my brain. Ouch."
5,Jeff Dunham-Arguing with Myself,This is such a great DVD! Jeff is awesome. You don't realize that they are really puppets.
5,Jeff Dunham DVD,I love this DVD and enjoy how quick it was delivered. I will definetly order from Amazon again.
3,"Good, but not as good as ""Spark of Insanity""","My title says it all. Jeff is good here in his first Comedy Central special, but aside from hilarious stand-bys Walter, Peanut, and Jose Jalepeno (on a steek), the other characters are one-dimensional and not overly funny. If you're going to buy only one JD DVD, make it ""Spark of Insanity""... but this one is worth the investment also."
5,Jeff Dunham Arguing with myself,"After the first couple of minutes you forget that Jeff is the only one on stage doing the talking. And when he has a 3 way argument, it only shows how brilliant Jeff really is. I would really like to see him in person."
5,Hilarious!,"Jeff Dunham is one of the best comics out there. I've seen his act for years and after seeing him live recently, I had to own this DVD. We've watched it three times with three different couples and it left us in tears each time!"
5,Very Funny!,Jeff Dunham is incredibly talented. His characters are personable and subjects are common everyday things that everyone goes through. Everyone can relate (with a big laugh). We've watched this over and over and still can't help but laugh all the way through it each time. It's hillarious.
5,Hilariously funny!!,"I've never laughed so hard!! Not necessarily for kids under 14, but so very funny!!!"
5,Jeff Dunham,"This is the best ventriloguist that I've ever seen. He is truly remarkable in the way that he changes his voice and interacts with his ""dummies"". There is an ""unedited version"" on the disk which I preferred to watch. It is simply hillarous. I have played it again and again and cannot get tired from watching it."
5,"Review , Jeff Dunham, Arguing With Myself","Jeff Dunham is a GENUIS!!!! I have seen him live a few times,and this is DVD is actually better. He does all his characters on this DVD. I have watched this over and over and laugh everytime. My friends and I have found ourselves using some of his catch phrases. Very Funny. This is a MUST in a DVD collection."
3,funny BUT very profane,"The DVD gives you an option to watch with quite a bit of profanity OR you can select to bleep the offensive words, BUT the bleep is too short to cover when a profane word is used. Thus, the offensive words are obvious when used [more than a dozen times]. It sort of dampens the spirit of humor."
3,Parents be warned,This has a choice of bleeped or not but still has way too many things that should have been bleeped if you don't want a pre-teen hearing it.
3,Time to change,"I'm not a prude, alittle off-color is fine. But I am sick and tired of people thinking the F bomb is hilarious. Come on people,we are intelligent and can use better vocabulary than resorting to that!"
5,Comedy,Really enjoy Jeff Dunham's comedy style. Was a very good dvd. Would order more of his work in the future.
5,DonnaZ,I think that Jeff Dunham is the latest and greatest in ventriloquism and is the new Edgar Bergen and Senor Weneces. He is really funny and my teenagers think he is hilarious. I wouldn't have below 12 watching only because of the sexual references and some words. This is not a kiddie muppet show. Jeff's characters are truly that. I hope to see more of him.
5,Soooo Funny!,"I have been a fan of Jeff Dunham for so long. When I saw him on TV I was rolling on the floor laughing. I just had to have the DVD. When I received the DVD and saw it again, I was so happy that there was a lot more in it than what was on TV. I have watch it over and over and am hysterical everytime I see it!! He is amazing to watch. You actually think the ""dummies"" are real. I will probably order more for gifts."
5,I am still laughing,"I saw his routine on Comedy Central and decided I had to have the DVD.We have watched it several times and it's still funny. My kids quote lines from it. We had some friends over the other night and by the end, everyone in the room was laughing. Even the people who had already seen it.Mr. Dunham is a pretty good ventriloquist, but what makes him better than a lot of his contemporaries is the fast-paced humor and the use of more than one dummy at a time. The quick jokes and one liners keep you distracted from the fact that it's really just a guy with lotion (a running gag in the video) and you begin to believe that the puppets have their own life. Especially when he begins to pick on people in the audience."
4,A Very Funny Group of Characters and a Nice Young Man,"As you probably know, Jeff Dunham is a ventriloquist who appears on Comedy Central a lot. Apparently he has his own show now, but I haven't seen it. His comedy is not politically correct, but he's an equal-opportunity offender. He's topical and he's very, very funny.The characters who worked on this show with him include:Walter, an old curmudgeon with a face like a prune.Sweet Daddy D, introduced as his new manager.Bubba J, a beer swilling NASCAR fan.Peanut, who is something alien, I think.Jose Jalapeno in a stick. Yes, a jalapeno pepper in a Mexican hat. On a stick.So long as you're not easily offended, I think you will love this show."
5,Worth a look.,"I would highly recommend this DVD. If your a fan of Jeff Dunham, then you already know why. Catch glimpses of him on Youtube."
5,Gotta LOVE this guy!!!,"I absolutely LOVE this movie!! Jeff is the BEST at what he does and I would recommend this movie to any comedy fan! It's hilarious, non-stop laughs the entire length of the show! Great purchase!"
5,Jeff Dunham: Arguing With Myself,"I recently purchased this DVD and Jeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity. My family and I just couldn't stop laughing! Jeff's DVD's are non-stop laughter. Now we want to watch Jeff perform live when he makes an appearance near us!! If you are like me and like to buy DVD""s to watch over and over again, you won't go wrong by buying these. I'm even giving these to my sister for xmas. What else do you give the person who has everything?"
4,Very funny,"This dvd is somewhat hilarious, however, I must caution that it has A LOT of language. I would not recommend it for children or adults who do not appreciate foul language (like myself). Even though their is a ""bleeped"" version, it stills lets a lot of language go thru.My brother-in-law actually purchased this and he loves it."
5,Been waiting for this DVD for about 5 years now!,"Totally worth the wait, Jeff is an incredibly talented comedian it amazes me how he can keep all his voices straight. This DVD is just as great as seeing him in person, I'm crossing my fingers for a second DVD, if you're deciding wether or not to get this DVD, stop thinking about it and GET IT! It's totally worth it!"
3,something missing,"While I throughly enjoyed the performance, I am hard of hearing and could not believe that this DVD was not close captioned for the hearing impared. Had to turn TV all way up to hear."
2,I wanted to think he was funny,"The puppets are cute but not my style of humor. Apparently a lot of people think he's funny, though. I think I'm more of a Gaffigan style humor."
1,Racist caricatures not funny,"Jeff Dunham relies on stereotypes as a source for his humor. He might be a skilled ventriloquist but he is not funny. If you like carlos mencia or colin quinn you'd probably like this crap, but most of us laugh at xenophobes like archie bunker not with them. If you think this is funny, you are the joke."
3,One of the Funniest Comedians around,One of the Funniest Comedians around. You hear some of the material he's used on tour for years. The results are side splitting funny.
1,Terrible,"Just attempted to watch some of this on Amazon Prime's streaming service. Probably the most unfunny comedian I've ever watched, with Carlos Mencia being a close second. How the hell either of these guys got popular I have to wonder. Made it through 5-10 minutes of this Dunham crap and stopped."
3,"A few were funny, a few weren't...","One thing I dislike about this is some of the characters are either too repetetive or just plain not funny. Walter is BY FAR the funniest and so was peanut but the others weren't. I was hoping for the Super Hero guy but he wasn't in it. Either way, it's funny."
1,Old people humor,"If you enjoy lunchtime revues in Vegas, then this is the show for you. If you enjoy humor from within the past 3 decades... then stay away!!!!"
5,Jeff Dunham & friends,"This is absolutely hilarious. Did see the show on Comedy Central (edited version) but enjoyed the unedited much more enjoyable without the bleeps. Jeff Dunham is a master and his characters, especially Walter and Peanut, are phenomenally funny!"
5,Jeff Dunham - Arguing with Myself,Very funny--takes swipes at every group equally and shows how reality is really quite funny...we shouldn't take ourselves too seriously. Walter is my favorite...I think we all know someone just like him. I encourage everyone to see Jeff in person...the live show is better than the DVD and it is so much fun. Great day brightener.
5,Non Stop Laughter Till Your Sides Split,"Jeff Dunham has got to be one of the funniest and greatest ventriloquist's in the world. His characters, though cliche, are down right funny. At times while watching him, you'll start to think the puppet is real. This DVD shows off Jeff's talents superbly. Clocking in at around 90 minutes of nonstop hilarity with his puppets Walter, Sweet Daddy D, Bubba J, and of course everyone's favorite Peanut & Jose Jalapeno On A Stick. The dvd includes outtakes which are just as funny as the show, 2 versions of the show (one censored and one not), and even for the first time on a comedy show: an audio commentary from Jeff and friend. If you're looking for a way to spend 90 minutes laughing yourself to death, pick up this dvd. Jeff Dunham is hillarious and after 5 minutes of watching it, you'll agree."
5,"FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY!","This guy and all his ""friends"" are just as funny as can be, and worth watching over and over again. He's such a good ventriloquist that you actually forget he's talking for his friends, and his range of voices and accents is amazing. His own persona appears so sweet and upbeat, while his characters all seem to have ""issues."" It's a genuine hoot, and I highly recommend it!"
2,Over the top on innuendos,I have seen Jeff many times on television and have truly enjoyed the clean version of his show. I started watching this show with my family and was appalled at the number of sexual comments and innuendos. This was not at all what I expected and I am greatly disappointed.
1,just too dumb,I guess if you miss puppet humor from back when it was done well... This just isn't funny.
1,Best comediam inyears!,I love this tape. We haven't laughed this hard in years. This should be shown to people who are DEPRESSED...When is he going to do another one....Thanks
5,Jeff Dunham is a very funny man.,This is a very funny video. I highly recommend it to every one who wants to laugh.
5,"""It's a form of suicide!""","That is one of the better lines Peanut has. All of them are hilarious & the best part is in the bloopers.....its Peanut & that's all I'm gonna say about that, go watch it, totally hilarious!"
5,Too funny and entertaining!!,Jeff Dunham is very entertaining and we have been very pleased with this DVD. We have even loaned it to many of our friends so they could watch it as well. I highly recommend this if you like comedy and want to laugh a lot!!
2,Nostalgia,"I was looking for a song by Occulta Fama called ""Nostalgia."" I thought that this song was included on this CD. However, it is not on here, and I don't like the music on the CD. Unfortunately, there were no samples to which I could listen to confirm this was the right purchase.If anyone knows where I can find ""Nostalgia"" by Occulta Fama (as played on Sirius Satellite Radio), please advise.Thanks,Linda D"
5,an essential reference,"This book is in the public domain and can be found on-line free... but at this price it's worth owning a copy. Still the essential reference for the colonial period in South and Southeast Asia, especially India, Burma, Malaya, and the western Dutch East Indies. Unmatched info on places, peoples, foods, and things. Well documented entries with etymologies and OED-style chronological quotations."
3,"Contemporary rededication, but not roots ethnomusicology","Anything on Native Amer-Indian music is worthy since so little has been written on it; however, this book is focused on the contemporary scene, the artists and their backgrounds, and their work in the world today. It was more of a cultural magazine anthology than a serious book on musicology: the music itself, lyrics, rhythms, tunes, and their development and historic spread. Note that this small book is even smaller considering that the text of this book is double-spaced, as in a manuscript, probably to increase the thickness of the edition. Although disappointed in the absence of scholarship, being unable to relate in detail the tradition to today's exploration, the information includes many interesting comments and biographical sketches, and shows how this music has left the dusty museum archives to a living, growing art."
1,Too bad he's so wrong.,"The author is close enough to the story - and judging by his credentials, one would think he's intelligent enough - to illuminate the story of the salmon crash. Perhaps he's simply TOO close. Alternately shrill, arrogant, and whiny, the book supposes ridiculous motives behind his opponents' actions, and offers his own clients as selfless angels. There's no doubt that the issue is complex. That, alone, would seem to be a reason to recognize that there could be different perspectives without nefarious or purely self-interested motivations.Lots of heat, no light. Not worth the time."
1,A biased and unprofessional effort,"I too began this book with an open mind, but the author's blantant antagonism toward all agencies, parties, and conservationists in the salmon restoration debate quickly became too much to stomach. Saving Pacific Northwest salmon, especially on the Columbia & Snake Rivers, will take working together and understanding all sides of the issue, which this book does not take the time to do. It is single minded in its condemnation of everyone who attempts to make true progress on the issue, instead focusing on and glorifying those who advocate delay and denial. It's not worth your time--instead I would recommend Keith Peterson's ""River of Life, Channel of Death-Fish and Dams on the Lower Snake River"" and Blaine Hardin's ""A River Lost-The Life and Death of the Columbia"" for two much more balanced and well-thought out perspectives on restoring salmon to the Northwest's greatest rivers."
1,Terrible lies!!!,This book unsuccessfully attempts to discredit leading scientists and studies that have linked the decline of salmon to the interests that the author represents. Don't waste your time with this pseudo-intellectual nonsense.
4,Required reading for all who live (and fish) in the NW,"Buchal tells it as it is, with mountains of solid facts and many valuable cases. He sets forth the politics of fish recovery and lists the big boys in this ""drama"". I live on the Dungeness River, a major, undammed salmon stream, and I'm a participant in the local version of ""the great salmon hoax"". We've spent perhaps a million dollars with zilch results. Most of the players see it as permanent income, never mind the fish. Buy Buchal's book. Get the facts! At least glance at his web site."
5,Everyone should read this.,"This was required reading for my Criminal Justice major. It is truly one of the most compelling books I have ever read. I think it gives incredible insight into the juvenile system, and the juveniles themselves, which is an innately depressing topic. This book however, as sad as these true stories are, is more redemptive and hopeful than most on the subject of juvenile delinquency. I really do wish everyone could read this book."
5,Hopeful,Would give this book 5 stars for the hopeful ideas about rehabilitating violent youth offenders. Successful treatment program could be used nationwide and lead to increased rehabilitation instead of increased recidivism. Youths from horrific backgrounds and who committed horrendous crimes begin to feel empathy and remorse.
3,decent box set,"it haves some nice songs off of a pretty dope label (hypnotic) the only thing that bites is the inconsientcy of this set. some songs are nice trance, than others are goa, hard trance, which just make my teeth tingle. the stand out tracks are children of dub - nemesis, dj akira - take me higher, kinder atom - niple, transistorhythm - eternity."
4,great gift idea,"My wife is a lover of a good cello, so when I gave her this disc for Christmas, she loved it!"
5,A Great Western,"One of, if not the best, Western television show produced. Very well reproduced clear B&W; picture and clean, crisp sound and many features. This was Clint Eastwood's first starring role and if you like Eastwood you will want these shows if for nothing else but to see him as a young performer. Good acting and interesting guest stars. Rawhide tells the story of a crew of cattle drovers and their adventures on the trail. Lot's of action and good stories are set against the western skies.Boxed sets have liner notes and the DVDs are protected on book page type holders. This seems to be typical of CBS Video boxed sets. Hopefully more of Rawhide's seasons will make it onto DVD."
2,"confusing, not enough on details--especially his battles","This book is a constant barrage of difficult names and convoluted information; and too little organized information on his battles. Suddenly your there and then gone, thinking, well it said something about it was a benificial out-come for Frederick--didn't it? It was a mess, really--I read only half. Two stars because of the topic."
3,Interesting But Flawed,"Although this book is very well-written (at times it feels like a novel), I cannot help feeling that at times there was something missing. The sections that deal with Frederick's upbringing and home life are compelling, but as soon as Mitford dives into Frederick's battles (which were so numerous they almost defined his later life!) the discussion becomes very dense and hard to follow. While I loved hearing abour Voltaire's visit to Potsdam, and the interaction between the two luminaries, I felt that this short time was dwelt upon for a bit too long, perhaps to the detriment of other events in Frederick's life. The book is very sympathetic to Frederick William I (Frederick's father), who I feel is one of history's least likable characters. When it gets to Frederick's later life (after the Seven Years' War), the coverage becomes sparse. However, because at times it is so readable, I recommend this book to those who have little to no knowledge of Frederick and his times."
2,Mitford's Frederick the Great,"Mitford's treatment of Frederick the Great is good for those readers who have little to no background on his life and times, since it is a very fluid read and is loaded with humorous anecdotes. It also is relatively non-partisan in its treatment of the subject, although Mitford clearly admires Frederick. Nevertheless the book tends to be very light on important details surrounding Frederick's campaigns, and not nearly as good an introductory piece to Frederick's life as Asprey's >The Magnificent Enigma<. Serious Frederick fans can bypass this book altogether."
4,"Interesting Read, Nothing Ground Breaking","I enjoy reading this book to see his many interesting ideas. Having said this, the book doesn't contain any ground breaking idea or any ""must have"" idea. Still, it is an interesting book that I don't mind reading."
3,Too wordy and gets off track way too much,"Perhaps the author should revise this book and make it less ""wordy"". It feels as if he is trying to explain things over and over. However, the examples are great and I believe that overall I would recommend this to anyone starting Java and couple it with a ""For Dummies"" or Sams ""Teach yourself...."" series to cross reference and look for other ways to solve a particular problem or just get better explanations.I give it three stars because I like it...but this isn't a book I would rave about to people either."
5,cool,Really good buy. My java teacher said its almost the same as the 7th edition but he prefers this version. Its cheap and easy to read even though the course is difficult for me.
3,Not for everyone,"While I found this book informative and detailed, I think that may be the main problem with it. It is written in a confused manner that gives the reader too much information on each page. I was constantly feeling bombarded. The information is presented in several different ways on each page and it can get disorienting while reading. That said, the book is very thorough and well researched. I am not sure that it is anywhere worth the price, however. For a third of the money you might consider Java: A Beginner's Guide by Schildt, or one of the O'Reilly books."
3,Could be the best Java book I own.,"Pros:=====Good material. Great organization. Good examples. In Color. Love the writing style.Cons:=====Print is to small. This should possibly be spilt into Vol 1 & 2 or the format enlarged to make the material more readable. Yes, I know it would cost more but the additional paper would be worth the cost."
5,Java 1.5 Enhancements,"Last semester, I used this book for a Java Programming class. I commend the Deitel and Deitel to be one of the first authors to cover the many features of Java 1.5. And, believe me there are numerous enhancements that were added to Java 1.5.You do want a book that starts off with the enhancements as opposed to one that mentions them in an appendix as an afterthought.The students seem to like the fact that the authors thoroughly explain every line of every example."
4,Good index,"I use the book mainly for quick references and sample code to supplement the online JavaDocs.Pro:+ Great index - best I've seen in programming books+ Color - easier on the eyes+ Compact - not a lot of wasted space and useless diagrams+ Lots of Sample Code+ Code on CDCons:- Expensive- Sometimes keywords are hard to find in text because they are not highlighted very well (in light blue)- Printing might be off (some colors weren't aligned during printing)- Ad pages in the back- Softcover - gets damaged easily when carrying aroundOverall:+ Very good resource, better than the Head First Java book for people already accustomed to programming books."
4,Learn Java Now,This book is an excellent review of the Java programming language. It's chapters are well thought out and easy to understand. It's use of color really helps when reviewing the hundreds of sample Java programs and other diagrams. This book even teaches you the basics of object-oriented design (OOD) and the Unified Modeling Language (UML).
4,Very Good book,"This is very good book, goes to the point and give you a lot of info. However, the book suppose to come with a CD, which I never recieve it."
4,This CD is P. Diddy's Best Since No Way Out!,"The Album is great, and definately worth the money. Aside from Mario Winans and Joe Hooker, Puff has gotten a whole new team of producers to work with. The album features up and coming new artist. Cherri Dennis gives us a sample of some promising vocals. In this work, Puff puts on Kain, Big Azz Ko, G-Dep, Black Rob, Faith and others."
2,P.,"P.DIDDY HAS TOTALLY LOST WHAT LITTLE RESPECT I HAD LEFT FROM THE NOTORIOUS B.I.G DAYS AFTER LISTENING TO THIS HEAP OF DIDDY!!THE ONLY REASON I EVEN GAVE IT 2 STARS IS BECAUSE BLACK ROB SHINES ON EVERY TRACK HE IS ON AND G-DEP SOUNDS LIKE HE HAS PROMISE BUT AS FOR MR COMBS I THINK HE SHOULD JUST STICK TO THE ""BAD BOY"" AND ""I THOUGHT I TOLD U THAT WE WON'T STOP"" AD-LIBS THAT MADE BAD BOY THE LABEL THAT IT IS TODAY.SORRY DIDDY BUT THE SAGA ENDS NOW!"
4,Mainly for experts in Finsler geometry,"The authors claim to turn the subject of Finsler geometry with this bookinto a more teachable one and to have a candid style of writing.This is definitly true for the first 50 pages, where the concepts ofFinsler geometry are very well explained and the exercisesare manageable and perfectly interrelated with the text.Then the Chern connection and the curvature tensor of Finsler geometrydrop out of the heaven without any explanation of the ideas leading to theseconstructions. So one has to derive them alone. In doing so oldertexts on Finsler geometry like the Grundlehren text of Rund are morehelpful than this volume.But the book was apparently prepared with great care. The layout must be calledbeautyful and it really facilitates reading this book. Many referencesto the literature and classical papers of the subject are included. So beginners,which want to get a first aquaintance in Finsler geometry, find at least some help."
4,"unique and pleasant, provoking lyrics","The mix of steel guitar with piano, reminds me of Tumbleweed Junction or Dlyan and the Band."
5,"Twenty-three years later, still a great album","Jeez, I think I had this album back about 1975. If you're looking for 70s Southern Rock, believe me, it's well worth the money."
4,Great but not excellent compared to Tomcattin' and Marauder,"Simply put while ""Highway Song"" is great, it still is a ""Freebird"" tribute. Covers of Free's ""Wishing well"" and Randy California's ""I got a line on you"" are excellent, but are still copies.As far as the other songs go, if any other hard rock, southern rock group had of recorded them, it would have been one of their best lpsPut it this way; if there were ten star ratings I would give STRIKES 8 stars, compared to 10 stars to the Tomcattin' and Marauder CDs"
5,Rock n roll,Just the kinda music I listened to as a teenager that I love so much that I will never be able to give up!
3,Good solid music,"If you are a fan of solid classical rock, this CD is a must have. ""Road Fever"" is mighty ""heavy""... it rocks hard, folks. Song 7 has lyrics that get me everytime I listen to it. ""Left Turn on a Red Light"" is great. I liken their sound to Deep Purple meets Dixie. Another excellent feature of BLACKFOOT is that they are not just some copy-cat of Lynyrd Skynyrd! I can't wait to try ""TOMCATTIN'"""
5,BLACKFOOT'S MOST FAMOUS SONGS ARE ON THIS,"THE TOP BLACKFOOT SONGS HIGHWAY SONG, TRAIN TRAIN, LEFT TURN ON THE RIGHT LIGHT ARE ON THIS ALBUM HENCE THIS IS BLACKFOOT'S HIGHEST SELLING ALBUM. AND IS CONSIDERED THEIR BEST. WHICH THERE ARE A FEW SONGS THAT ARE AVERAGE AND YOU CAN SKIP. SO IT'S BOUT EVEN WITH ALL THERE ALBUMS. I LOVE BLACKFOOT AND ALL THEIR ALBUMS. EXCEPT FOR VERTICAL SMILES ALBUM. SO IF YOU LIKE ONE BLACKFOOT ALBUM YO WILL ALSO LIKE ALL OTHERS. NO RESERVATIONS FLYIN' HIGH STRIKES TOMCATTIN MARAUDER SIOGO ""DON'T BUY VERTICAL SMILES"" RICKY MEDLOCKE AND BLACKFOOT MEDICINE MAN AFTER THE THE REIGN HIGHWAY SONG LIVE LIVE. I HAVE REVIEWS ON ALL OF THEM."
5,THE FIRST OF A PERFECT TRIO,"This is one of the finest Southern Rock albums ever. Songs like Train, Train and Highway Song are just as good if not better than any song any other Southern Rock band sung. But there is more on here than just those two songs, the classic and probably the best on here is Left Turn On A Red Light, not to sure what that really means but it's awesome anyway. Ricky Medlocke and Co. are at the top of their game here and the winning streak continues with Tomcattin'."
4,The picture on the cover tells it all,"OK, kids. Here we have Rattlesnake Rick Medlocke making his first foray into the big time, and what a show he puts on!What a freakin entrance! This album shows absolutely everything that this genre has to give. If any of you want to learn anything about southern rock, buy this CD.This is the evolution that Duane Allman would have wanted.I won't bore you with a track list, but just know that this is what you've been waiting for. It'll scratch your itch."
3,A bad night,"No matter what you do in life, we all know the feeling of having a 'bad day' or a 'bad night'. This was Mingus 'bad night'. Unfortunately, it was recorded and released. Tha band was not familiar with the material, and you can hear it here. There are good moments, specially when Dolphy and Clark Terry takes solos, but it is a difficult listen. Mingus fans need this of course, but if you want to listen to a good symponic Mingus go listen to 'Black Saint and sinner lady' and if you want a good live Mingus go get 'Mingus at Antibes'."
2,A Failed Masterpiece,"""The Complete Town Hall Concert"" also known as ""Epitaph"" was to designed to be a larger than life jazz symphonic masterpiece, but ultimately it was a failure. There is a lack of cohesion to the performance, the musicians seem lost at times, and Mingus' compositions are uncharacteristically dull at many points. Even the posthumous tribute/remake ""Epitaph"" fell short of expectations. It was an ambitious project, but one that you can feel free to pass on."
5,Great old school group!,"Oh my goodness, this group performed in Las Vegas and they were a hit! We truly enjoyed their performance and hanging out with them!!"
1,Homphobic and negative,"It's been a few years since I read this book so my synopsis of the story may not be 100% correct. It's about a man who lives in the show business world and is happily married. However, through the years, he has sex with men. However he's not gay (he says again and again and AGAIN) and dumps the guys when things get too serious. The guys always commit suicide or go crazy...but he sees nothing wrong with that. Then finally he meets a man who he falls in love with totally and has to admit he's gay...but how will his wife take it.Merrick's books are hardly great literature but (with the sole exception of ""The Lord Won't Mind"") they're homophobic, negative and always end with the gay men being murdered or committing suicide. The gay world is always shown in a negative light and God forbid anyone should have a happy relationship! The ending of this book is extremely tragic and I threw the book away after finishing it. Negative, homophobic and just plain sick."
4,Couldn't put it down,"But it wasn't any kind of literary masterpiece. So many of Mr. Merrick's books are unbelieveable but it almost always doesn't matter. First of all, why did Mark get naked in front of Clare and then jump into bed with her? Another big problem I had was how did Walter fall in love with Tom so fast and decide he wanted to spend the rest of his life with him right off the bat? This never happens in real life! But who cares, it was a great story that I couldn't put down and am looking forward to reading the rest of his books."
3,A Real Drag,"I expected lots more from Leeb and Fulber (aka Front Line Assembly, Delerium, etc.) but I think Desideratum is a tough listen for even the biggest ambient fans. I get the feeling that most of the two cds (just under 70 minutes each) contain mostly filler and very little creativity.This might sound great if played really loud or if you're in the mood for it, and at almost 140 minutes length it will do the job for those times when you're hallucinating from an overdose of insanity. Almost every track sounds the same. If I wasn't a supporter of the group and genre, Desideratum would be unbearable.Grade: 2 (**) and a half stars."
2,Synaesthesia - 'Desideratum' (Cleopatra) 2 1/2 stars,"Band's second release,key players for this studio project are Bill Leeb and Rhys Fulber.Two CD's,duration is two hours and twenty minutes.Best described as industrial/electronic with a somewhat 'sinister' edge to it.As a friend of mine put it,'Desideratum' is borderline tolerable.As for myself,I prefer to listen to one disc per time I choose to check it out.Tracks that I most remember noticing were ""Orion Nebula"",""Dark Core"",""Barred Spirals"" and the fifteen-minute ""Lifeless"".Might appeal to fans of Front Line Assembly,Delerium,Surface 10,Philip Glass and Red Shift."
5,I Love this Album,"Beautiful songs and sounds. Bill Leeb and Rhys Fulber of Frontline Assembly are amazing musicians.The first 3 songs on the 1st disk are my favorite. They are perfect to listen to when reading a good book, or when your chilling out or looking at the stars or something like that.Another reviewer said that this album is for when your by yourself, I could'nt agree more. Its not a party album or a dancey album or anything like that, its more of a Tangerine Dream style album. This album will put you in a relaxed trance, and it will make you think, and then think some more.If you like Delerium, Frontline Assembly, Will, Intermix, Equinox or any of Leebs projects you'll really enjoy this album.Its very cool."
3,Lacking in depth; overcompensating with length,"As a fan of Delerium and multiple other Leeb/Fulber/Peterson projects, I thought I'd check out Synaesthesia. I had heard Ephemeral was a much better album, but Desideratum was the only album I could find in stores. When I first popped this into my CD player, I was very impressed with the first song, ""Andromeda."" It was upbeat and very cool, like newer Delerium and Front Line Assembly and Pro Tech, but I was quite disappointed by all the songs that followed. They are too long for lacking in material. They're actually not bad songs for dark, ambient stuff like old Delerium, and would be good to fall asleep to, but I can't help but feel teased by the first song.If you enjoy dark goth ambient stuff, I'd recommend old Delerium or Synaesthesia's Ephemeral (which I now have) over this.If you like a little more upbeat but still moody electronica, I'd recommend newer Delerium, Front Line Assembly, or Pro Tech."
5,Excellent,"We read and reread this book often. It is a cute story and the illustrations are so well done. Recommend it for little girls, especially ballerinas."
2,"Way too thin, almost not even a book!","The story is okay, but this book may as well be a free prize from a Chick-Fila kid's meal. There is nothing to it!"
4,Good Music,"Arrived within a few days after ordering,and in excellent condition. The CD is good but wish it was mixed but great dance music."
4,No one serious about weather should miss this book,"Bits and pieces of weather are put together systematically. Never too brief. Never too technical. A must-read for all laymen interested in weather on earth.The text and colourful pictures succinctly explain how the different weather systems form on earth. Though the book's focus is on US weather, many of the theories, principles and processes explained apply to other locations too."
2,Very Disorganized,"I do not understand these favorable reviews. This book is terribly disorganized. It jumps from subject to subject and does not teach or explain weather systems in an understandable manner. Though it is filled with fun facts and sidebars, it does not lay down fundamentals and then build on these fundamentals, which is the basis of any scientific text. Unfortunately I have not found a better laymen's text on weather and weather systems."
3,"Okay, but not great.","This book is okay.Pros:- Easy to understand presentation of material.- Lots of color pictures.- Wide selection of information.Cons:- I don't like how the book has inserts that break up the reading of the main material.- I don't like how pictures are occasionally referenced by text multiple pages away.- I skip the multi-page inserts on people, it is not weather information, and not interesting to me.The book is cheap, and does do a good job of explaining quite a bit about weather. If you want an easy to understand presentation of material with basic explanations and lots of pictures this book is good.I was hoping more for a meat and potatoes text book style approach to learning weather.Okay book, but not what I was looking for."
5,Very good explanations and diagrams,"I was looking for good diagrams and smart explanations for a book I'm writing, and The Weather Book delivers. Very smart illustrations, and in-depth discussions of weather, water, and other influences on our weather were very helpful. I'm a little distracted by some of the articles that cover weather history, but I've been reading it from the index forward, using it more as an encyclopedia than a linear book, and I'm very happy."
4,As diverse as the band,"I've checked out a few compilations of Uriah Heep for comparison; and in my opinion this is a very good one. It's time span is from 1972 - 1982, and covers four different line-ups and three singers (David Byron, John Lawton & Pete Goalby). Unfortunately they've left out John Sloman from the 1980's ""Conquest"". Being that this is a single CD clocking in at 56:32 it could still have included some tracks of the present line-up. This is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. The track selection, however, is excellent! If you're a newcomer to Uriah Heep this a very good place to start. If you're a regular fan this would be nice to take to work or parties, or why not have it in your car? Anyway, it's a good choice."
3,Masked Female Avenger,"Not only does Zorro not get mentioned at all, why the silly title, as the story has nothing to do with him. The central character is a masked female avenger played by the very capable Linda Sterling. The title should be ""The Black Whip"", as this is what the heroine is known. Another disappointment is that the episode cliff-hangers are weak and the serial also lacks the atmosphere and pulse-pounding soundtrack music of the Republic Classic Serials such as, Zorro's Fighting Legion, Spy Smasher, Nyoka and the Tigermen, just to name a few. The redeeming factors here are the action sequences that are well handled and there are plenty of fisticuffs, good stunt work coupled with some rough riding from our heroine. The story-line is good, and has all the ingredients of a good action packed western."
2,"""The Black Whip has got to be a man! He's out-shot us, out-rode us and out-fought us. He's stopped us at every turn!""","No matter what you may think of this Linda Sterling adventure serial, consider that:1.) ECHO BRIDGE's reported time of 177 minutes is a full half-hour less than this 12 chapter cliffhanger originally ran.2.) The company inserts an intermittent watermark at lower screen right.3.) No sign of restoration on any of their antique film dubs, so quality is solely dependent on source material.Caveat emptor."
2,Don't waste your time.,"Probably the stupidest of the Zorro ""chapters"". Zorro a woman? Gimme a break!!!"
3,First Book To Suggest Serious Romantic Thought,"I read this when I was 13, in the eighth grade. It wasn't a very enjoyable or riveting story, although I did not reach a point where I simply wanted to drop it. It's about a young teen guy with an eccentric friend named Homer Fink, and they meet a girl their age. The plot involves which one she will choose as her boyfriend. Though Homer was a relatively odd guy, I don't recall any real humor from the story. It was the first work I read that examined romance at a contemporary (my own age) level, and was valuable from that perspective. It made the point that, at that age, one does not genuinely know what love means, regardless of how much a crush you have on someone. To appreciate this book, it has to hit you at the right time in life. It might be constructive for junior high school teachers to read it, and broach the subject of real romance -- affection between two young people -- with their students."
3,A cute little story,"This is a cute little story about what happens when an absentminded genius is chosen by his classmates to run for school president. Interesting references are made to Greek gods and philosophers, and Homer brings a little 'truth and justice' to his friends.I feel like if I had read this when I was much younger, I would have enjoyed it more. Also, the author has managed to print some quotations in the original Greek characters and doesn't always translate them.All in all, though, an enjoyable story for ages 8-13, that though written in 1966, would be understood and enjoyed by more modern readers."
2,Virtualizer - 'Acid Warriors Dream Crystals' (Cleopatra),"First off, I'd like to mention that this is one CD release that I actually CAN fully understand as to WHY no one has yet reviewed it here. Simply TOO experimentally annoying for most. Export band from Amsterdam, Holland. Although they consider themselves to be 'industrial dance'. There are a couple of semi-likable tunes here such as ""Dolphins"", the ten-minute ""Paradyze D"" and ""Factor 23 Full Trip"". Might appeal to tolerant fans of System 7, Aphex Twin, Anubismatist and Fluke. Check it out for yourself and perhaps you can get more out of this CD that I did."
2,UGH....YEA OK,"Ok this group totally murdered this song! I love the classic even though I am 15 ok? I gave this piece of crap I 2 stars cos you have to admit it, it does get stuck in your head, well the lyrics but that's because of ROXETTE but their beat is good. If they could only do a different song to it!"
1,House track wannabe,"D.H.T.'s cover of Roxette's ""Listen To Your Heart"" certainly made a splash worldwide in 2005. But in all honesty, this is the cheesiest of cheesy dance music. An only ok cover to begin with, a few only so-so dance mixes were thrown together at the last minute and slapped on this single. The end result is one of the most mediocre dance offerings of the last couple of years. There are so many better dance acts to choose from out there, many of which were huge in the U.S. this year...Juliet, Deep Dish, Kristine W, New Order. You should go for their work before picking up this CD.D.H.T.'s cover will have a short shelf life in the long run, and will be quickly forgotten as the years go by. Give me Roxette's original version anyday."
2,Not The Original,"I can't believe they keep remaking these 80's songs & doing so terrible with them. I mean, Heaven by DJ Sammy? So HORRIBLE! Totally not the same as Bryan Adams' original romantic song. And this?? Terrible! Roxette's version had so much more feeling & emotion behind it. I'm a huge Roxette fan & if anything, this version is just so insulting, they definitely didn't do it any justice. I'm tired of watching people think they can just take over an old song without really trying & they just can't match the original. Come up with your own stuff, man!"
1,Is this the same DHT ??,"that does the song ""White Power""? As far as I can tell, it is. Just something to think about before you buy. Any group that promotes racism, doesn't deserve my money."
1,So bad it hurts!,"The song is originally sung by Roxette, it's not a DHT own song. The piano, acoustic version is the most boring thing I have heard in years. And the hard-core remixes are unlistenable. Don't waste money in this bad done cover. Buy Roxette's ""Look Sharp!"" or The Ballad Hits"" and you will enjoy the original and real version of the song, that is lightyears better than this! In addition, in ""The Ballad Hits"" you got all the greatest ballads that Roxette has released through these years. It worths every cent!"
4,Good mix single,"Another one of Robbins remakes. They pick a great song to redo, and overall the song is catchy, and the vocals are pretty good. However, the engineering and music are a bit subpar, and the six versions or so are simply not distinctive enough. Worth buying? Sure, but not the best engineered music out there. The highlight here is the killer vocals."
5,This Song Kicks!,"For lovers of club music everywhere. The Furious F. EZ Radio Edit is the best version of Listen To Your Heart on this disc, and this CD it is worth it for that song alone. It touches your heart, but it is also wholly danceable. If you like club music you should own this single."
3,Worth $4.00 but not much more,"I chose this book because I saw the good reviews and I was interested in a gay love story. I was pretty dissapointed. Like another reviewer said, the characters were not fully developed. I thought the writing wasn't that great either. There seemed to be alot of loose ends and questions throughout the book. I feel like the writer tried hard to create romance and mystery but it just fell short of the mark. The storyline was not good enough to keep me very interested. I definitely would not purchase another book from this author but for the $3-$4 amazon is asking I guess it is ok."
2,Missed Opportunity,This book had all the right ingredients but the author just did not have the necessary skills to take this book where it should have gone. The characters were not fully developed. Many issues are introduced but left unexplored until finally there is a real bombshell that gets dropped but nothing explodes in the story. I was left feeling that a promise to me had been broken. The romance between the two main characters was boring. The book is just OK. It could have been so much more.
1,Waste of your money.,"Pros: It's pink.Cons: The body is rigid plastic. The tip vibrates at a high frequency, but little power.Summary: Don't waste your time and money on this one."
5,A Way of the Cross to represent our Society.,"A poetic and beautifully significant Via Crucis, to instill in us Christ's trip to Calvary..in preparation for the Resurrection on Easter Sunday. Each station is prayerful yet theologically inspired. Full of the Face of Human Warmth. Written by our present Pope.Prayed on the last Good Friday of the life of the beloved Pope John Paul II."
3,This CD lurks like a specter in my collection...,"Even though the styles on some tracks are insidiously hypnotic, the overall brooding of some of the ambient house seems contrived and reactionary ... nonetheless it's a solid buy for a Sunday evening to get really morbid before Monday morning."
2,Product does not clearly specify the size in terms of,"I am from the Caribbean and in truth, I think I did badly in my purchase because it was specified that the advertising customized for adults 02 and buy for the holidays my wife and I, but it turns out that there are small, the breathing tube is not suited comfortably into the mouth and the mask is very close to the face causing the face to abuse, I believe that a present to my little nephews."
2,A little too late....,"I do shows and we were in need of a snorkel and mask. Since it is winter, I purchased this product online. I also needed this product very quickly so I chose the ""expedited"" delivery. Along with this product, I had made several other orders on amazon at the same time. Every single other item came in before the supposed ""expedited"" snorkel and mask. I waited well over a week for this product. No, I did not contact the seller as I barely had time to get on the computer to order it. I feel as though my money was basically stolen from me."
2,Dissapointed,I thought this tongue ring was quite attractive and unsual so I bought it. It is however notvery practical to wear. The studs on the top are rough and cut the palette. It cannot be worn for extended periods of time because it is uncomfortable. I would not recommend this product
4,"A unique, improvisatorial approach to the art of the essay","In this collection of essays, the subjects of which range from the commercialism of Michael Jackson to the wisdom and insight of Ralph Ellison to sex in the army, Stanley Crouch offers a fresh and engaging perspective on the ""blues"" that our society faces today. Although he is not always perfectly accurate and consistent in his sociological marksmanship, his application of the jazz idiom to his writing style is unique and, quite often, breathtaking. Crouch has proven himself to be a masterful esasayist and has demonstrated a firm command of the english language."
2,does not raise the bar,"Unfortunately, Mr. Crouch's arguments have run out of steam and settled into a argument for the status quo. Crouch made his most valid points back in the 70s, and has not kept up with the times. Readers are advised to stick with Crouch's ""Outlaws and Gladiators""."
3,Hit&Miss,"Stanley Crouch i Respect his Mind.but i don't agree with alot of the things he says.he is a trip.i guess i will always have issue at some of the things he once said about Miles Davis after the 60's.Mr.Crouch likes to group things.he is a very Intelligent Man but he can go all over the place&leave you hanging.these essays are interesting.I don't agree with his thoughts on Michael Jackson nor Malcolm X.deep down he probably would love to trade places with them.folks he seems to always have an issue with are Free Spirits.hint,hint."
5,Rare Dye Book,"As a student of natural dye techniques, I was particularly pleased to find this book. It is full of methods not in current use and has information on plants that is presented in a novel way. Highly recommended !"
2,A Goal That fell Short,"This book should have been an excellent resource (a cisco bible even) if the editors and technical reviewers had been more careful. Too many grammatical and sentence structure errors. Not to mention, the index is hard to read (difficult to distinguish where an alphabetical listing begins and ends). Also information listed in the index wasn't actually included on the page it referenced."
4,cisco router inside out,"this is the only reference book you need for cisco routerthe book has the design and configuration of RIP I and RIP II, IGRP, EIGRP, OSPF and BGP. Also included are chapters on frame relay, and ATM design as well as DSL and voice, ISDN, DDR and VPNOf particular interest were the coverage of security and firewalls as well as voice configuration.All in all, the book is more than a reference tool for cisco router technologies. A little hitch though, is the typographical and grammatical errors.A GOOD BOOK"
3,Bought for the title track,"I really bought this whole CD for just one song (""Groovin' Out on Life"") and to me, it was worth it. I loved this song when I first heard it years ago because of the melody and lyrics, and I still love it 'til this day. The other tracks are nice, but nothing like the title track!"
4,More Great Gems from this Amazing Group,"I was pleased to be able to purchase this fine cd - a great blend of vocal pop from the group, some lovely duo harmonies similar to the Everly Brothers and some fine solo recordings all from the Hickory Studios. I will add this to my many recordings of The Newbeats. BREAD and BUTTER to all pop enthusiasts."
3,3 1/2 stars. A pleasant and engaging listen,"Nothing suprising, deep or new. However, Tyner and Hutchinson are the consummate professionals on this album. They have a lovely rapport with one another and they are both in top form. This is not the type of introspection that Burton and Corea are into."
5,Home Grown 4,"One of the best mixes of jammin' music I've heard in a while. It rivals some of my own burned CD's. With The Big Wu, Deep Banana Blackout, Inasense, and others, you can't go wrong with this album. And the sound quality is great too!"
1,Not worth it...,"I bought this bottle warmer since I was going on a 7 hour trip and didn't want to have to take 15 minutes or more to heat a bottle. The box says it heats a bottle in just minutes...yeah, more like 15-20 minutes. Plus you have to make sure the button that the bottle sits on is completely pressed down. I had to hold the button down myself or press the bottle down against it because the bottle wasn't heavy enough. Otherwise the device doesn't turn on or shuts off the second the button is not fully depressed. It's a pain in the butt to me. My baby doesn't eat on a specific schedule so I don't start heating a bottle until she starts to wake up. It takes 5 minutes just to get the bottle out and situated, then it takes 15 minutes to heat the bottle because the heating band is only against about 2/3rd's of the bottle. By then my baby is screaming. I would not recommend this item."
1,not practical,this product is not effective UNLESS the bottom of your bottle is FLAT. otherwise it's not going to work unless you feel like suppressing a small button for a long period of time to heat your bottle. i'm still in search of an auto bottle warmer. any bright ideas????
2,okay,"Hardly ever use it. Not so great a product because it takes to long to warm the bottle if it is cold, especially if you have to make several stops while driving, it will take forever to warm. Secondly, it is kind of difficult to use when using an advent bottle. It does not not hold the bottle well."
5,Just what we needed,It'll warm your baby's bottles in less than 10 minutes. That's good enough for me while on the road.
1,OMG don't waste you're money,"Oh wow, I don't understand how this company stays in business I bought one of their older model bottle warmer didn't work at all! Then I decided to purchase this one, I thought maybe they would have improved the performance but I have the same problem, it doesn't work...don't waste you're money, people. The best way to warm up a babies bottle is take a thermostat filled with boiled water and a cup large enough to fit the bottle. When you need to warm up the bottle pour a little bit of hot water into the cup then place the bottle into the cup....presto!"
4,Pretty neat!,"The bottle warmer does take a while to heat the bottle! Maybe 15-30 minutes, depending on how cold the bottle is. My advice is to just pay attenion to your babies feeding times. Start warming before their normal feeding time. Do not wait until they are screaming because they are hungry! Otherwise that will be a very long 15-30 minutes! The item does work though. You do have to make sure that the bottle is pushed down well to press down the sensor to make it heat. It does not sit well in a standard size cup holder either. So you have to be careful that it does not tip over. Overall, it gets the job done...with a little planning ahead. :-)"
4,easy to use,"Fits wide bottles. It takes about 20min., so you have to prepare in advance. Small & convenient. It's a great product."
4,Nice card,"These are excellent mini-SDs, and the 2GB lasts practically forever for 3MPixel JPEG stills on my Canon HV10. Recommended! The adaptor also lets me drop these into a standard card reader, or my Palm PDA (adaptors SHOULD be included with mini or micro SDs as a matter of course... check before buying)."
5,SanDisk for Best Flash Memory / Blue Proton for Best Vendor,"I'm very particular when I buy from Amazon. When there are multiple buying choices, I tend to stay with the Amazon offering, even if reasonably higher than the others.Only occasionally will I trust and support one of the other vendors listed. J&R; was one of those. If they are an option, they are now automatically trusted.Blue Proton has now also achieved that status.I've recently placed a series of orders for Flash Memory. And what can I say. Their prices were excellent, their notifications were prompt and informative, and their delivery was each time, like Amazon's, ahead of schedule.And, incidentally, I purchased a bunch of Mini-SD and Micro-SD cards. SanDisk only - for consistency and constant quality.The ones labeled ""bulk"" are a bit cheaper, but still include the SD-sized adapter. You apparently do not get the retail packaging.Select Blue Proton. Their exceptional efforts deserve to be supported."
2,Goin Ebay- the shipping is more than the product itself,"I didn't see it till I got the invoice, but if I would have known it was $25 shipping I would have never bothered with this product"
3,"GOOD CARD, BAD SUPPLIER!",MA CARD WORKS PERFECTLY ON MY PHONE. AND I HAVE TO SYNC EVERYTHING BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE SENDER SENT ME A MAILFUNCTIONED CARD. IT DOESNT WORK WITH THE ADAPTOR. AND ITS THE CARD BECAUSE I USE MY BROTHERS CARD AND IT WORKD JUST FINE.
2,"cheap, but doesnt work with everything","My computer has a hard time recognizing it and now my phone won't detect it. It worked 50% of the time for about 6 months, but now its dead."
5,Good purchase,Just what I needed to insert into my Motorola Q to save songs to the phone. It also has an adapter so that it can fit into regular sized storage disk products. This was much cheaper than at the store.
3,hard time finding the one i needed,"i ordered this for my granddaughter's mp4 player for christmas, which unusually called for a mini sd card. when i got it, it did not fit it. but fortunately it fit my son's wii."
5,Great!!!,It works great! Thanks to you guys I was able to get it. Couldn't find it in no other place.Thanks again!
2,Half Worked,"I bought the mini card to work in a smart phone. The mini card worked fine. I had a problem when I plugged the mini card into the regular sized case that comes with it. When connected together like this, the card could not be read. I would/should have returned it. I found that a new computer I bought had a mini card reader built in. So, I was able to read the card without going to the trouble."
4,Nice Old-fashioned Murder Mystery,"E X Ferrars ""Hanged Man's House"" is well done murder mystery in the classical format. When a brilliant but morally repugnant scientist is discovered hanged in his house, nobody really believes it to be suicide. Before the police even arrive on the scene another body -- this one mummified! -- is found in the basement. Most of the scientist's associates and their families seem to have motives for killing him, and nearly all of them are trying to conceal things from the police.The story moves along at a good pace. The plot is good despite a few hackneyed devices (A man builds a new rock garden shortly after his wife disappears. Come on!). Characters are OK but nothing special.A nice old-fashioned ""cozy"". Very enjoyable."
3,A Disappointment,"There is so much better music out there to discover and enjoy. Don't waste your time with this double album. Try Ethereal Melodic Trance instead, for one."
2,Ho hum,"Sorry, I waited weeks for this to arrive and it's really a dissapointment! I thought this would give my six year old son some inspiration for new vehicles to build with his basic LEGO bricks. Actually the designs featured in this book are so basic that he could teach them a thing or two. I guess if you're really a beginning builder than it's a decent book."
5,(clouston@mailbox.co.uk) - just let its music take you...,"very nice selection of scores written by leeb and fulber.i for one love delerium and have all cd's except reflections 1 and 2. monolith, cloud barrier and colony all have an atmospheric mood to them. monolith has sounds from Synaesthesia's desideratum Disc II.if you like this try these other bands by the same artists... Synaesthesia: Embody and Desideratum, Equinox: holon and Co Ex: Ascents Meteora. (the last isn't delerium, but is pretty sweet except for the price!) if interested DONT get Co Ex's synaesthesia album."
5,The best water bottle - EVER!,"I have sugar gliders, a lot of sugar gliders, lol. 24 to be precise and some of them were used to using water bowls, but they were just too time-consuming to fill each day; plus, water bowls can get contaminated with waste and are subject to spillage. I bought a pair of these water bottles when I got my first sugar glider, and I was so impressed with them that as my sugar glider family got larger, I bought more of these bottles.These bottles are a breeze to wash and keep clean, the fit is tight, and there is never an issue with leaking. The newer ""models"" of these water bottles now have little ""floats"" in them so that it is easy to see, at-a-glance, from across the room if the water level is low. They've taken a great bottle and made it even better! I have at least two water bottles on each of my cages as a back-up water supply.Check out KV Vet Supply - that's where I get my bottles. Price was very reasonable and shipping was super fast! I'd order from them again!"
5,Great product,"I didn't want plastic by products leeching into water, and this bottle is fantastic - doesn't drip, easy to clean, really quality product. If you're debating, buy this. It's a bit more expensive, but you're only buying it once. Totally worth it."
3,"bottle is great, ability to hook it to cage is horrible","We bought this for our pet rats, The bottle itself is really nice and barely leaks. HOWEVER: we could not easily attach it to the cage, my son had to make his own wire hanger for it. Really not hard he just used some easy to bend wire."
5,This is a great one!,"While I've never been a huge mystery fan, I truly enjoyed this one! I instantly fell in love with the Michael Drake character. You couldn't help but root for him through the mess he found himself in. I seriously couldn't put it down until I finished the entire book.I hope there's more to come."
4,Kept me turning the pages,I really enjoyed this story and the way it was written. Will look for more books by this author for my kindle
4,Great book!,Can't wait for the second book to be out. This had all the twists and turns of a good mystery!
3,"as mysteries go, OK; as page turner or great lit - better luck next time","This author has great potential, it's not yet developed, but you can have an enjoyable read ... If you've nothing better...."
2,Under abnormal conditions,Lots of twists and turns! Quick reading. You don't expect the real villain. Shows how quickly someone's life can change.
4,Surprising,"With a lot of bodies stacking up and numerous suspects I still didn't guess the murderer until the end ,totally caught me off guard ."
2,It's Ok...I guess,I guess it was an OK mystery...not the best I've read. The writing style was kinda awkward...didn't flow well in my most humble opinion.
4,a remarkable debut,"A truly remarkable album. I can listen to and enjoy every track on the album. Donalds has a remarkable voice that comes along very rarely. You can choose to listen actively to this album, or leave it in the background ... sort of like Roxy Music's Avalon, tho' the styles are totally different.Bottom line -- if you like any pop, soul, R&B or funk music released in the last 35 years, you will enjoy this album."
5,A TALE OF LOST AND FOUND LOVE,"I was bought this album on tape by a a holiday romance,I loved it then and treasured it, then I lost the tape and have been trying to find it for years as deleted.Thankyou Amazon.com for bringing back those happy memories of sunny days and happiness that this album bought me.My holiday romance ended there, but Mishale I can't live without you and Andru, and now I've found you again. Thankyou"
1,Delivery not timely,I ordered this book on or about Sept.15th. I was leaving for a trip on the 25th and thought it would definitly be to me in time. The book company is in the same area of Maryland in which I live. I have tried to respond to the email address on the receipt. This is evidentaly not the correct email address......
5,Search for the Phillistines,"I found Search for the Phillistines an excellent work for the layman which includes me. At the same time, obviously a scholarly work. I have read a good deal on The Peoples of the Sea and this was the best in helping to identify, at least, some of the origins."
1,limited cd play,"the music is great, the cd is made cheaply (too thin) the cd plays on my boom box but will not play in my auto cd player or my dvd player connected to my television."
3,Starts great but fades quickly!,"The quality of the DVD series is very good and its starts off very strongly.....but it doesn't last! After the first few episodes it really gets corny and poor. Enjoyed some of it, but overall I can see why it only lasted one season."
1,huge disappointment,"The first thing to note is that this film does not feature the real Frances Farmer as the video info states. Rather it is a biopic which makes the 1982 version with Jessica Lange look like a masterpiece. As Frances, Sheila McLaughlin is abysmal. In some scenes she's not even blonde! And she looks more like Piper Laurie than Frances Farmer, who was petite and luminously beautiful. The film offers no greater insight into Frances than the Lange version, in spite of the publicists claim, and the direction is heavy-handed and humourless. A lot of the time it reads like a bad play with hardly any character interaction or drama. There is even some pseudo-Bergman touches which are almost laughable. In spite of the scant Frances Farmer titles available on video, a viewing of Come and Get It or Toast of New York is preferable to this disaster."
1,"Is this ""real"" lobster?","Are you kidding me? Sure it comes at a lobster price but I never tasted lobster so synthetic and sooooooooooooooo rubbery in my entire life. I should know, I've lived in New England and Florida. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE! If you must buy from Omaha(a steak company), buy steaks. At least it's steak and not horse pretending to be steak!"
1,Thoroughly Disappointing,"I suppose this book could be construed as some sort of commentary on human depravity but to me, the whole thing read like a bad Twilight Zone script. Thoroughly disappointing considering the wonderful stories in Heatseeker. Extradimensional being f**ks with some humans for kicks. The end. There. I just saved you the trouble of reading the book."
5,Read this,"A small book that packs a punch. In his ""Preface"", Chet explains that he began writing this book in an effort to illustrate how Englishmen were militarily transformed into Americans; how they gradually gave up their European defensive tactics and instead adopted Indian offensive tactics. As with most myths, the deeper you dig, the less you find. The book Chet wound up writing demonstrates the exact opposite of what he originally thought he'd find. It shows how and why European tactics WORKED in North America, despite the terrain and theIndians' guerilla tactics.Although the book deals with the colonial period only and does not analyze the American Revolutionary War, Chet's argument fits in with what we know about George Washington's management of his army during the war.The sections about Benjamin Church, Rogers' Rangers, and British light infantry tactics are particularly interesting.The endnotes contain interesting and funny incidents that reallyenhance the impact of the text."
5,excellent reading,"I loved this book, the mix of Oriental/Asian/American intrigue was just right, kept me reading and finished it in an afternoon. I hope this author has more up his sleeve!"
1,Battery is Complete Failure,When I received the battery I charged it per normal but it did not hold the charge. Subsequent attempts to charge it have failed totally - it just won't accept a charge. I have reported the problem to Lenmar per their Warranty procedure but have not yet heard back from them. I will have to purchase another brand and would suggest others do the same initially.
4,Indistinguishable from OEM,It works. It lasts as long as the battery that came with the camera. It's substantially cheaper than the OEM model.
4,Very good CD,I've bought this CD three months ago and I'm still listening. It's a great CD. If you like Trance you MUST have this CD.
1,BAD,"...simply put..it has no focus, no story, bad acting....a bad and overly noisey score intended to scare fails miserably.This is really bad and predictable.At the end i bet you'll go 'what was the point'?Not recommended."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"It's a shame that the writers, or the editors, or the director couldn't come up with an ending that tied an otherwise scary film together. To often, it seems, horror pictures don't leave the watcher understanding what they just saw. This is a classic example, it will leave you wondering what the heck just happened."
1,Run like the wind,"The Producers, Director, cameraman (I know there was only one), everybody associated with this... this... whatever this is have got to be kidding me, right? For that matter all the reviewers who say how ""like totally awesome"" it was have got to be kidding me.Oscar? Maybe in the next world.I rented this for &1.50, and I still feel like I was ripped off.Run, people. Run away."
1,Don't bother with this one.,"I sat through an hour and a half with this movie and I want that moment of my life back. This movie is trying to be too many things- but what it is not is a horror movie. The cast did the best they could with a script that goes no where but it is still crap. Half way through the movie you will be sitting there wondering two things.1. what the hell is going on2. Do I care what is going on and when is this going to end.Here's a helpful hint, watch the first fifteen minutes, then fast forward to finishing twenty minutes and you will have all the information required to know what took place."
1,Worthless,"I'm an avid Horror movie goer. My taste in horror flicks may not be the best, I'll admit I am a little picky, but they still have to be worth watching. This movie has no redeeming qualities to it whatsoever. I watched it with a group of people and by the first five minutes none of us knew what was going on, yet the ending was easily predictable. It was one of the worst horror flicks I've ever seen. I wouldn't recommend even renting it."
3,To Grandmother's House We Go...,"I really like Tom Sizemore. I even liked him in THE RELIC, an otherwise putrid affair. I loved Gina Philips in JEEPERS CREEPERS, and yes, she's a hottie. My main problem w/ RING AROUND THE ROSIE is that it takes too long to get going and to get to the point. This would have made a fantastic episode of TWILIGHT ZONE / NIGHT GALLERY / ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS etc., w/ about 40 minutes shaved off. The story is interesting enough- girl plagued by ghostly / psychological / evil hauntings. It just needs a big trim. As it stands, it's not terrible / unwatchable, it's just bloated. After seeing it once, I watched it again, fast-forwarding through the parts I knew to be superfluous, and found it far more enjoyable. I recommend this technique..."
2,Don't waste your time,I bought the movie and wish I had left it on the shelf. It's not very entertaining at all.
2,"Horror-able, just Horror-able",What in the world is going on? That's the question you will ask yourself many times during this movie. We laughed so often during this movie at how stupid it was and how little sense it made throughout.Save your money. Don't waste your time. The movie was seriously bad...just horror-able.
2,Disappointed,"You know, I was disappointed in this book. I read the reviews and thought it was going to be great, but it wasn't. This book is geared towards women who are older and have been married a long time, mostly stay-at-home-moms, who found themselves, all of a sudden, divorced and forced to go out and work. I recommend it for those women; not for younger, single moms. Young single moms who are already working full time jobs & raising children know the stuff in this book already."
5,A cure for what ails you,"This music will move you. This CD has something for whatever you mood you're in---or whatever mood you want to be in. I listen to it while I'm working, while trying to unwind, or when trying to balance myself for meditation, prayer or ritual. A powerful connection between sound and soul."
3,Why is everyone white?,"This is a book with a lovely message. One child has the power to change the world for the better through a simple act of kindness. The story describes the happiness and good deeds that spread across the planet in a chain reaction of goodness. The story is well done, but the illustrations are not. Why is every person white in the chain of good deeds? Even when children from every contintent are pictured they're all white! This is a major flaw in an otherwise worthwhile story."
5,"You can Count the Seeds in an Apple, but not the Apples in a Seed",Delightful book about the usually unknown and countless effects one kind deed can trigger. Everyone should read this book and go out and do something nice for someone today. Nice illustrations. Appeals to kids and adults alike. This one is a classic and makes a great gift!
5,Uplifting book for reinforcing good deeds,"Wonderful choice for children as a read aloud that promotes doing good deeds for others. A great ""what goes around, comes around"" book. Great teacher resource with cute pictures and catchy storyline. I am really glad I bought this book!"
3,Misses the mark,"I love the concept behind this book -- that ordinary, everyday kindnesses can have far-reaching results. But the book was simply too long and complicated for young children to understand. I tried to read this to my four-year-old, and she had little patience for the wordy story. She also showed absolutely no interest in the mathematics of how one person can affect many. And my older kids (ages 8 and 10) found the story too simplistic.While I love the story, it misses the age groups on both ends, being simultaneously too simple for older kids and too complicated for younger ones."
5,"Yes, It Really *Is* That Good","I asked myself how many knitting books a person needs. As it turns out, probably not all that many. But if you have even the most cursory interest in sweater design, you do need this book. I've been knitting for 25 years, and I'm astonished at how much this book has taught me. Helpful close-up photos and the author's light, conversational tone will make you feel like you have her sitting right next to you. As the author is the one selling the book on Amazon, it arrived autographed, which I thought was a nice touch, and would make it a particularly nice gift for any knitters you know."
1,A very misleading title,"I bought this book - which has very pretty pictures and lots of information about putting different patterns together - BUT the key missing ingredient is that no where in the book is there any information on how to create all the various types of cables and stitches she pictures. You CANNOT create your own sweater based solely on this book. You'd have to buy books on how to make cables, etc and how to construct a sweater pattern. . ."
5,Feast for anyone passionate for Aran Sweater knitting,"From the time I saw my first Aran design (which happened to be an afghan), I knew that I had found my home in the crocheting and knitting community. I am one of the growing number of men who greatly enjoys both knitting and crocheting, though developing skills in knitted Aran work is something relatively new to me. Janet's book on Cables and this one are two of the finest I have ever seen when it comes to detailed instruction. I am very pleased to have purchased both books, and even more pleased to know that their content is going to teach me pretty much everything I want to know when it comes to this style of knitting."
1,Terrible! Dino Down!,"I guess even great actors like Gil Gerard have to take a break from greatness. I knew it was going to be terrible, but I hadn't seen Gil in a movie for sometime. He really only had a cameo role. Dino was bad! I mean really bad. It wasn't even worth a penny to watch!"
3,Dino Wolf,"Bad name for the title and the wolf. Dino refers to large, but this wolf was simply hairy, not the least bit large. The wolf was not scary and it was a really bad costume/makeup job. Very third rate, not up to today's standards. The acting was terrible, but I gave it 3 stars just for the entertainment portion of it. It wasn't good enough to scare you or make you laugh. I wouldn't waste my time seeing it again."
3,A Dire Film at Best,"Don't let the cover fool you. It isn't a mega-huge, CGI cross between a dinosaur and a wolf. If it had been, such a great title wouldn't have been wasted. No new plot twists here. No spoilers really possible in this all too predictable made for DVD monster flick. Basically, it's a genetically engineered werewolf type monster that can run around in daylight. Lower shooting cost, no doubt. The daylight does hurt the suspense factor. The kills are numerous and messy. The acting is a bit better than average. Over all it's your standard monster movie fair. No nudity. But enough gore to please the average teenage fan-boy. I like monster movies. So,it's no classic,but it works for me!"
3,Dinowolf,I got to say this movie is reasonbly good in terms there's lots of gore and blood and the structure of the werewolf was inpressive so overall the movie has a good plot and a good design.
2,Dino Wolf in Dire need,"Dinowolf is actually a released in 2009 film called Dire Wolf - which is more accurate (in that there was such an animal but definitely not in the time of the dinosaurs - and not related to dinosaurs, but hey...My problem though is more with the fact that none of the reviews have any note of the things Fred is normally noted for and IMDB has no commentaries from anyone about it. Weird for this kind of film. I am going to take as wild guess that that is because most of the natural audience did not see this and the few who may have really had little to say. This implies no nudity (female) - and who would, with no offense, really wish to see Gil naked. It also implies special effects not good enough for comment, though possibly not bad enough for same either. Overall I have to go with my impression that I have no reason to buy/watch this film. So I won't. Those who do, enjoy!!"
5,A cultural treasury of art!,"I bought this book, as another reviewer said ""just for the pictures"". When you study this book day after day with a mind on fire with creativity you will realize that there is nothing wrong with that. The plates are truly awesome and filled with many hundreds of the most beautiful mosaics, calligraphy and carvings. This not just a ""picture book""; the author has carefully laid out the geometry behind it to be intelligible with many, many drawings and some 3D computer compositions. I am now studying this brilliant world of art with the hope of creating in these techniques myself."
5,Happy Days The Fourth Season,"Good season to watch of happy days, i would reccemmend anyone to watch these series of happy days."
3,Gary Hoyt,"Season 1-3, five stars, season four needed better writters in my opinion, thats why the lower rating."
5,Happy Days are here again!,"I have been waiting non-stop, for the release of Happy Days Season 4. This will make a great Christmas gift, for those who loves the Fonz. I hope Paramount releases more Seasons on DVD, in the near future. I also hope they continue releasing Laverne and Shirley and Mork and Mindy on DVD.Here are some seasons left for each of these three shows.Happy Days Seasons 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11Laverne and Shirley Seasons 5, 6, 7, and 8Mork and Mindy Season 4Please make for more seasons of these 3 cool shows on DVD!"
5,Happy Days Revisited,"We love Happy Days. My wife and I, both senior citizens, decided to re-visit the show. It was great to have the discs available to watch it in our time."
2,"""Sound Enhanced"" (?)","The three DVD set TV GUIDE: THE 50s GREATEST COMEDIES claims on its box cover that the programs contained within are ""Sound Enhanced."" What this means is that TV show themes have been replaced by an inept keyboardist who tries (but fails) to duplicate the music we know and love. These overdubs are all poor, but what's been done to ""The Jack Benny Program"" is most egregious of all.For anyone still interested in this set--The three discs are stored in individual slimline cases within a glossy cardboard slipcover. Video quality is fair to average.Fortunately, there's lots of excellent public domain material out there.RECOMMENDED:MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT'sBEST OF JACK BENNY - 39 EPISODESAlso, theirESSENTIAL FAMILY TELEVISION - 150 EPISODES"

2,Stop at tomcattin,Trying to make money with Siogo and the next album Vertical lines. These two albums are watered down. What happened? Like another fine southern band Point Blank they got talked into sounding like Journey to make $$$Stop at Tomcattin IMO
5,Maybe the best Blackfoot album,"This is Blackfoot's best album along with ""Marauder"" and ""Strikes"". On ""Siogo"" Blackfoot step a bit outside their former southern rock 'n' roll formula, and this album is more radio-friendly, but it still rocks! The best songs are ""Send me an angel"", ""Crossfire"", ""Teenage idol"", and ""White man's land"" but there are no lousy tracks at all. If you're into melodic hard rock you shouldn't hesitate to buy this record since it's worth every dime.And for those who don't know, ex Blackfoot drummer Jackson Spires has a ""new"" band called Southern Rock Allstars, and their latest album ""Danger road"" includes two songs written by Spires/Medlocke - please check it out!"
4,Good cd,"This is good cd by blackfoot, not quite great, however. Has some very good songs on it Send me an angel, teenage idol, white man's land, sail away, and drivin fool stand above the others on it. It's good to have it back in print so you don't have pay twice as much for it for a copy of it. Most songs on it are pretty hard rockin..would be lot better than the next cd vertical smiles"
2,Not even close,"This album is a huge disapointment-going into pop 80's with overkill on keyboards- this album has no edge and will be resold -it isn't even close to Tomcattin, Strikes or the lessor Marader-Thanks K.C."
3,NOT Bluesman Michael Powers from New York!,This is NOT the 5x Blues Music Award Nominee & blues master MICHAEL POWERS (MichaelPowers.com) from New York or Bayonne NJ.
5,The Fascination of the 20th Century Mind,All I can say is I wish this book had been available when I was studying for my Ph.D. forty years ago. Watson's knowledge of the primary intellectual trends of the last 150 years is--pardon the overused word--awesome. I recommend this book to all of my current and former students.
1,A review of the Kindle edition,"I do not want to comment on the book itself...all has been said in the previous reviews.The Kindle edition of this book is nothing short of an utter disgrace of book editing. I have so far covered 50% of this book, and found about 50 to 60 typographical errors of the worst kind...it is obvious that no professional editor looked at the manuscript after it had been converted to an eBook. Considering the price of this edition, and the gravity of the topic, this is shameful. Nothing more to add, other than ""Fix it!"""
2,"I read only half the book, but listen...","OK. Writing a review for a book that you did not fully read may seem unjust. And that too a bad review at that. It is not that I did not finish it: I COULD NOT finish it, which defintely reflects on the nature of the book. It reminded me of that time in ninth grade when I decided to memorize the dictionary and could go only as far as the word ""aba"". Not that the dictionary is without its charms. There is only so much useful information the mind can assimilate unless presented in a style that engages it. So if you buy this book, try to use it like a dictionary or an encyclopedia. If you have ever wondered what Bill Gates' nephew's name is, the book probably has it. But I would suggest you look up in the index for "" Gates, Bill..nephew"" instead of trying to read it ascendingly till you reach that particular section.BTW, If you are wondering what ""aba"" means my dictionary tells me it is ""A fabric woven of the hair of camels or goats""."
3,I broke it!,I broke this ( bent it ) with my bare hands trying to pry something loose. I only weigh 165lbs you would think it would hold up better
1,fause ad,"I received the item and it was not the item described on the web site.I ordered the maul because it was described (in print and also pictured) as having over strike protection.When it came it did not have this protection.I called you costumer service and I stated my problem to a foreign person that I could hardlyunderstand.He stated that I could return it but would have to pay for the shipping, which I think is ridiculous, being that theitem was not as described.I am very unhappy with the false advertisement.I should at least get a partial refund.I could have purchased the same item locally and not payed the shipping."
3,Not what I wanted to read.,"Although this book does contain information on the scientific hunt for the 'flu virus of 1918 which is fascinating, it was not what I was looking for. I was looking for a book which gave a detailed narrative of the disease's impact on the world. Davies does include this information but not to the degree that I desired. It is still a very good read though.I would recommend it if you have an interest from a scientific perspective, however, historians like myself should go for something more relevant to our area of interest."
1,Leonard Cohen Live at the Isle of Wight,"I absolutely love Leonard Cohen, but only his recordings in his later years. Through time his voice has taken on a deep rhaspy, whiskey voice that adds so much more depth to it. His early recordings have great credence, but it is his later recordings that have drawn me in."
3,Leonard oh Leonard,"I know this was recorded when Leonard Cohen was new, however I wish I had purchased his later, studio CD's and not this one."
5,Everybody Knows,"Cohen is the man! His poetry is amazing, his voice is a little lacking but he more than makes up for it with the emotions he elicits from his listeners. This is a beautiful album with a lot of heart."
5,"cohen - still excellent, always was, it seems","The Isle of Wight concert DVD really adds a lot of meaning and depth compared to the soundtrack alone. We have all heard those songs, and those exact tracks, but the video brings it to life. And when you compare Wight to the recent concerts (and if you havent made the physical and financial effort to see at least one of them, then you deserve to, and indeed will, die in relative misery - compared to the enduring high that the rest of us obtained for our money) ah yes, comparing Wight to recent, you can see that the calm and brilliantly structured current format had its genesis way back then. For my part I hadnt even noticed how he created that Cohen aura back then, until I saw the Wight video.This is really worth while owning, not just because one should collect every collectable crumb of . . . whatever one is interested in, but because it will in some small way make your life better."
5,One of the best star wars books I've read,"I've read a lot of star wars books, and this one is one of my favorite. Stackpole puts a twist into writing as he puts it in 1st person, something most Star Wars authors won't do. Even though its written as if you've read the first 8 X-wing books, you can still follow. Stackpole does a great job, and he rebuilds my confidence in him after the disappointment of Isard's Revenge <- a truly poor book."
3,'NOT' a stand-alone novel,"I, Jedi struck me as being a 'What's going on behind the scenes of other Star Wars novels?' type of story. It's a good read don't get me wrong but I think it references too many events from other books. That is great for consistancy, but it fails when the reader has not had the benefit of reading the works that Stackpole is referenceing. Coming from that perspective it seems like the author is just trying to plug his other works. I like Corran, and I think he's a very cool character, but I think his 'coolness' is built on the expense of making the other characters look weak. (With the exception of Tycho who he gave beaucoup props to) My only problem with the character is that everything seemed to go his way. His plans always worked and he was always right. I hated that quality about Admiral Thrawn and it doesn't compliment Corran Horn much either. But Mara Jade makes a cameo and that is way cool. All in all, a decent read, but it has its faults."
4,a good read,"I loved the book and one thing I really like about it is how it ties into the story of the Jedi Search, Dark Apprentice, and Champions of the Force books."
3,Disapointing,"Overall this was a pretty good book. Corran is an interesting character and Stackpole is a great writer. But he has a couple of major problems that undermine the entire story. First of, by comparison to other books, his wife is missing for over a year! How can you be spending so much time at the academy and fooling around with pirates while your wife is missing. Second, Stackpole simply cannot wright with any characters other than his own. Luke is a somewhat naive and arrogant ""Jedi Master"" who knows nothing of the Force but thinks he knows everything. Mara is an overly freindly smuggler, not the hardend warriror Zahn intended her to be. Plus the annoyingly constant need of every caracter to discuss every aspect of their relationships with each other(Is that Mara Jade discussing the reason she's not attracted to Corran?) Stackpole is a good author but he needs to realize his limitations."
3,okay..,this is an okay book.i like how it refers to the other books. but not worth even 8 dollars. sorry.
1,This Book S_ _ _ s ... You fill it in !,"I agree with the reviewer who's posted twice about his displeasure of this book. Who the heck is Corran Horn ? And how did he get to be such a powerful force in the Star Wars Universe ?I don't remember this character or the alias he (supposedly) went by in the Jedi Trilogy series ? From the way this book was written you'd think Horn should be running the Jedi Academy !This character, Horn, is soooo into himself that he's a Living Legend, in HIS own mind.And what's up with making Luke seem such a weak Jedi ? After reading (practically) every Star Wars book, including the Dark Horse comic series ... with ALL that Luke has been through and that's from the Light-side to the Dark-side and BACK again, after defeating the clone of Emperor Palpatine and countless other events, you would figure that Luke would be much, MUCH more powerful than Stackpole made him to be.This author should refrain from writing within the Star Wars Universe."
4,A new perspective on Star Wars novels...,"I thought I, Jedi was well done as a first person novel. However, The first half of the book deals with Corran's Jedi training, then the Jedi part is just left behind. Also, it deals with events in the Jedi Academy trilogy, which is just like reading those books over again. Later, he becomes a Invid and fights against the New Republic, while inviltrating the Invid's command structure. I was hoping a part of the book would be set aside for dealing with the issue of Corran's fighting against the New Rebublic in a military tribunal."
3,Alright but not that great,"I can't totally rip on this book because the fact of it is, is that its very difficult to write a book that's place in the middle of a series that was written years before. On the hold he did an okay job with fitting it in. but I think the reason he tried to portray Luke in that way so it'd be different from KAJ's trilogy. This was also the first book to focus on one character which I didn't care for since I personally prefer having Zahn's multiple plots that at the end coverge cleverly. Stackpole experiemnted with many things that had never been done in SW books (First person, placing a story in the already written series, following one character only) but I think it was too many in one book. But another reminder who knows if all of this was his idea for first person, maybe it was suggested by the publishing company. Peeps gotta remember that writing an official SW book is different than writing a 100% original novel and some aspects you don't have complete control over."
2,"Great writing, bad story","While the language itself was admirable, the plot was ludicrous. The title is I, Jedi. The main character is a jedi-wannabe who can't do jack, drops out of school, and searches for his wife many months after she becomes missing for no apparant reason at all. I also did not think that he could ionize rouge squadron while flying a tri-fighter (The rouges have a reputation for being good). The description was pretty good, but the plot needs work. I like the parralel to Jedi Search, but Corran really didn't do anything now did he? I know that this is a contraversial book (Some people feel like they are Corran Horn, they should get out more often) but I would think that it is somewhere inbetween. I don't regret reading it, yet like the X-Wing on the cover that is missing a cannon, the book still lacks something."
1,So Bad...,"In fanfiction circles, the book's main character, Corran Horn, is amazingly popular. After attempting to read this novel, I am completely *mystified* as to why. This book is so poorly written that I couldn't even finish it. Corran is inexcusably arrogant. He insults, puts down, and otherwise undermines everyone in Kevin J Anderson's Jedi Academy Trilogy (particularly Luke), any chance he gets.I *much* prefer JAT to this crap. Not only does Corran have an ego that's limitless, he also comes off as a player that cares precious little for his *wife*. Total fail. If I could I'd give I, Jedi a zero, it's that excruciating."
2,Bummer,"I was dissapointed. There was too much shallow philosophising and reinterpretation of other people's story lines (Lucas and Zahn). If you're going to philosophize, make it thought provoking! Also, too little real charachter study to make the dialog time worthwhile. The rusult was not enough action -- mental, emotional, or physical. I can believe that Stackpole wrote this one quickly, because it looked like he never took the time to go back and trim the parts that dragged and beef up the parts that were really exciting.....A final beef, Luke is a hero and I don't like it when heros are made to look impotent (a problem I also had with Zahn's original stories). Heros can certainly have (and should have) flaws, but that's not the same as impotence. All that being said, if you're as much a Star Wars fan as I am, you'll read the book and enjoy it anyway!"
5,One of the best Star Wars novels I've ever read!,"This is undoubtably one of the best SW books I've ever read. And I've read almost every one that has been written. It is a wonderful book in itself, but it is ten times better to those who have read several SW books. The references to events in other works gives the story a depth that would be impossible to attain without the support of such a highly developed environment that the myriad of SW novels has created.It starts a little slow (like all classics) but it is worth it to set up the storyline. It is interesting to see the events of the Jedi Acadamy Trilogy through someone else's eyes. I'm a little disappointed with how Luke is portrayed, but that has nothing to do with this particular novel, that's just the way the character is. The second half of the book is a non-stop page turner. It never lets up till the climax. This is a must read for anyone who has any intrest in Star Wars."
5,Ecellent book one of the best Star Wars books ever written!,"Stackpole totally outdid himself with I, Jedi. It's simply a magnificent read, one level with Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy. I, Jedi is the first and only Star Wars novel written in the first person and follows the character Corran Horn from the X-Wing series. Almost al the other beloved Star Wars characters are featured in the story but not as the main characters. This gives the book a very refreshing slant. Stackpole also improves upon Anderson's Jedi Academy Trilogy, fleshing out plot and fixing inconsistancies etc. I highly recommend this book to anyone, and I simply cannot praise it enough. It is really a incredible creation."
4,Everything you needed to know about a Jedi,"I feel that this book could have been a lot better. For example I personally thought that Corran/Keiran seemed a bit immature for all of the experiences he went through in his life. His thoughts and actions just didn't seem to fit his character background. With that exception, I thought the rest of the story was great. There is a lot of detail about the Jedi. It is not an easy book to read. You really have to pay attetion to the details to understand everything the author is telling you about the Jedi. We must remember that these stories are fiction and if the hero fails then what is the point of writing the book. The hero is suppose to defeat all odds that are stacked against him. No matter how unbelievable. I would love to see more of Coran and I would especially like to find out if his children have Jedi powers. I would recommend this story to anyone who loves to read Star Wars and/or a good Sci-fi story about a hero that is truly a ""good guy""."
5,Stackpole knows his stuff!,"I loved this book from beginning to end! Although it did start off a little slow, it was an excellent way to learn more about the Jedi and Luke's academy. Plus it gave me more time to get to know my favorite non-movie character, Corran Horn. I, Jedi is one of the few SW books that has given me that tingle of excitement when the protagonist is in danger and barely makes it out alive.My only complaint is that Luke is characterized as a little too indecisive. He seems like he doesn't have the slightest idea what he's doing with his academy, allowing Corran to step in and advise him quite a bit. I realize that Luke does not know everything about the Jedi teaching tradition, since he was not trained in the most efficient manner, but after a while he just seems spineless. Still, the book deserves 5 stars for being a well-crafted novel that is difficult to put down."
2,This book was not that great.,"I've read the X-Wing books and thought they were good, but I've gotten rather sick of Corran Horn. He's been overplayed too much-rather like Kyle Katarn and Kyp Durron. Not only that, but like them he's characterized as almost superhuman in a way. I also think someone should resolve the way Luke Skywalker is portrayed. Sure, in the movies he wasn't all macho but in these books he seems to not be able to do anything at all. Isn't he the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy and also the most intelligent? Then why does he either sit there and do nothing, or pull a trick out of his hat that makes being a Jedi look like being a stage magician? There's no power behind his techniques, just flashiness. Overall I think that this book was a disappointment; just another run-through of the basic storyline that's been echoed over and over again."
1,"I, Jedi - I, Puke","I'm sorry, but this is the worst Star Wars book I've ever read. I really enjoy most of the books, but I found the trite dialog and hero worship of Corran Horn offensive.I didn't enjoy the first section of the book but didn't find it horrible. It wasn't until he starts lecturing Luke Skywalker about being a Jedi that I got sick. The idea that he could defeat a 4,000 year old Jedi while Luke is blasted senseless is just silly.I also found the use of the dialog to explain everyones' actions really sad. This is high school level writing. Example: ""You didn't like this book because it had really bad dialog and was utter trash. So that is why you are writing a review. Because you didn't like it.""If you want some good Star Wars read Timothy Zahn. Kevin Anderson has written some decent books also."
1,Reads like a bad comic book,"This is, without a doubt, the worst Star Wars novel I have read. It's incredibly cheesy, predictable, and utterly uninspired. On the dedication page Stackpole admits that he wrote it in one month and it shows. Luke and Mara are completely out of character. Luke is basically made to seem unintelligent and lost and Mara is soft. While developing this annoying characterization of Corran Horn, he tries too hard to make him seem good at everything (even better than Luke). It reminds me of a Steven Segal movie at certain points. It has maybe one redeeming scene *SPOILERS* where Corran Horn's grandfather (a pre-clone war jedi) is described absorbing all the energy from a light saber when it punctures a hole in him and causes it to shut down. That's all you really need to know though."
3,a pretty good for the first star novel i read,i jedi was the first star wars i read it was okay i like the idea for corran horn become a jedi knight also like how he takes on the indentendy of a dark jedi to find his kiddnapped wife i amlooking for to read more star wars novels i preffered star trek Novels .
2,Not worth the journey,"Tepid at best, boring at its worst, ""I, Jedi"" managed to turn the exciting world of the Star Wars universe into a dull plod through the day to day life of a Jedi hopeful. It featured a romantic separation that didn't capture any of the angst, ho-hum battles, and even a sophomoric morality lesson about sex. This book had none of the passion that made other S.W. books great, nor did I care about any of the characters in this installment. Although this book didn't sink to the level of the abysmal ""Courtship of Princess Leia"", it was lackluster and at times tiresome reading. My advice is to avoid ""I, Jedi"" and re-read one of the S.W. books by Timothy Zahn or Kevin Anderson instead."
1,It deserves zero stars,"Like others, I can't believe all the positive reviews. This is the worst star wars book I've read! The first person perspective is boring as it leaves out important events. The main character is boring as well. How can a guy go on for weeks knowing his wife has been kidnapped? The plot was totally unrealistic, even for sci-fi."
4,A good Star Wars book,"This is definately a good book; I like Mr. Stackpole's writing style, but I do think that it would be hard to follow if the read had no prior association with his other Star Wars novels. I hadn't read his other books, so I was a bit lost character-wise. But the book kept me reading, and I liked it."
5,This is the best book ever written.,This is the best book ever written. It is exiting and has all the qualities of a perfect book. Everyone has to read this book!!!!
1,Play It Again Sam!,"Ummm.... I don't even know where to start. This book was written for one purpose and one purpose only. To make money. It is basically the Jedi Academy Trilogy all over again except the writing it terrible, the characters personalities were not portrayed correctly, and the main character is completely arrogant.The author made Luke Skywalker look completely clueless. I really don't understand why this book was almost rated as good as the Thrawn Trilogy. It wasn't even close!"
5,Wonderful first-person epic!,"Aside from River God by Wilbur Smith being my favorite first-person book, this one follows close in second. In I, Jedi, Corran Horn (hero and main character of the X-Wing Series) has taken leave of Rouge Squadron to realize that he has the Force with in him. Upon figuring this out his wife, Mirax gets captured. Desperatly wanting to find her, he goes to Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy to home in on his Force Abilities. To cut a long summary short, Corran must choose between bowing before the dark-side and 4 millenia old Dark Lord of the Sith Exar Kun, or die trying to save his wife and everything he holds dear. Truely a must read for any X-Wing fan. I would advise reading the X-wing series up to the point where Stackpole stops writing them, that will give you a good idea of what the book talks about including Corran's past and bloodlines. If you don't have time to read those just read the first of the X-Wing series by Stackpole which will give you enough of the back story."
2,Luke the buffoon...,I was disturbed at Stackpole's take on the Jedi Academy. I haven't read many of the X-wing series as space combat given in such tedious detail is boring to me. I liked Corran's character for the most part and kind of liked the idea of different people having different strengths and weakness regarding their talent using the Force.The portrayal of Luke Skywalker in the book was terrible. Stackpole made him out to be an insecure and incompetent person until the very end. Stackpole seems to want to make the Jedi Academy into a military academy turning out Jedi cadets. It seems that an Jedi apprentice should find their own way through the Force with the guidence of their master.I did enjoy the book and I do hope to see Corran Horn in other SW novels just a little toned down a little bit.
2,OOOh Brother,"I'd have to say that this is the most poorly written Star Wars books ever. After reading them all I really think that Michael Stackpole could do the universe better justice than this. His original X-wing series was great (though hardly the best) and I have to respect the way he uses his own characters. But the feeling I got from reading ""I, Jedi"" was ""In the Jedi Academy Trilogy, Luke Skywalker made this or that move, and then Cilghal did this,while Streen did that. However, this was all really the manipulation of undercover agent Corran Horn,who knows everything that's going on better than the Jedi master whose running the show."" Come on! Kevin Anderson's novels where totally awesome, but I, Jedi really felt like it was trying hard to replace their grandeur. Grow up!"
1,ugly...,"This is one of the worst Star Wars books written. The first person view sucks and Corran whines all the time about his dad's death , GET OVER IT. Luke's whiny and weak , and worst of all , a FEMALE Moff??? I thouht the Emperor was biased against females. Daala was said to be the highhest ranking Imperial female , and now we have a female Moff?. wierd. And there is apperently a timeline inconsistency here , since this story apperantly takes place with the Jedi trilogy. Corran Horn sucks. I hate him. And I hope he doesnt look as ugly as he does on the cover , if so I cant imagine why all these females in the X-wing novels were atracted to him. skip this book. nothing important happens anyway."
1,What a load of rubbish,"Frankly, I'm disappointed. After a bang-up job on the Rogue Squadron series and on the Blood of Kerensky trilogy, Mr. Stackpole seems now to be using his book as a Corran Horn vehicle to the detriment of the other characters. I shudder to think that he may be a participant in not only the Star Wars, but Battletech universe as well."
1,The Author does not know anything about star wars,So you can become a jedi in a matter of mere weeks? This is the most ridiculous book I have ever read and it was written by a person who knows nothing of the star wars universe. The portrayal of Luke was down right aggravating. Just thinking about this book makes me mad. I will pretend it doesn't exist from now on.
5,The most accurate book I've ever read.,"Now, first, I want to say that this is the FIRST Star Wars novel I'd ever read when I read it [I've read nearly all of them, now]. I picked it up, because it looked like an older version of Luke on the front, what with the greeen saber, astromech, similar dress, and the image of young Luke in the back.ANYWAY...This book, to me, captured the very essance of any type of training that one could equate to Jedi training. Yes, Corran was full of himself early on. Heck, he stayed that way through most of the book. But, he saw that his ego made him weak, and as the book went on, he saw that ego keep getting in the way. He learned to let go of it, and learned to touch the Force.This indepth look into the human nature, and its reaction to Jedi training, is by far, the most accurate book I have EVER read on the subject.I've re-read this book so many times after the years, I had to buy a second one, cause the first fell apart."
4,not one of the best,I was sort of shocked to read how long Corran spent at the Jedi academy. I would have gone right at and started to look for Mirax. But yes I know Luke told Corran that it was to dangerous to go out at the time since he was a Jedi vulnerable to the dark side of the force. The part where he was the dark shadow and getting people afraid was great.
5,Killer book....,"Stackpole did another 5 start book. If you have read the 4 X-wing books, this one fits right in. The one thing I didn't like about this book was that it was in 1st person, insead of the clasic 3rd person. Other than that small inconvence, its a great book, with lots of interesting twists and turns. Recomend this book to everyone!"
4,Another hit for the Star Wars universe!,"Michael Stackpole has done an excellent job of bringing one of the 'Rogues' into the limelight. Corran Horn is faced with his greatest challenge ever as he begins the search for his missing wife Mirax,the part-time spy, full-time trader and daughter of the notorious Booster Terrik. His search takes him to the Jedi Academy on Endor...to his homeworld of Corellia and many other exciting places! Read it...you'll love it!"
4,Very Well Written Book,"I, Jedi By Micheal A. Stackpole I, Jedi is a book about a Rogue Squadron pilot who goes to a Jedi Academy to find his wife who has participated in a movement against the remnants of the now fallen Empire. At the Academy, he gets involved in mysteries and interactions with ghastly creatures. He leaves the academy out of anger against Luke Skywalker and goes on a man-hunt for his wife . But, along the way, he is forced with challenges. Will he turn to the Dark Side or die? This is a very good book. Stackpole takes a big leap by going first-person in the Star Wars universe. But, surprisingly it works. Good characters and first-person make this a top-notch book. The only problem is that sometimes I found myself slipping away in interest and felt asleep a few times on it. Overall a very good book and I would recommend it."
4,Original.,"The first person point of view is new to the Star Wars universe, but it's also one of the things that sets this book apart from all the others. Stackpole manages to blend his events with those in the Jedi Academy Trilogy pretty well, and he goes into more detail about Jedi training than Anderson ever has. Not to mention that a whole book about Corran Horn couldn't be a bad thing! Overall, it was an original Star Wars book, and a joy to read."
5,This book is simply one of the best Star Wars books EVER!,"I, Jedi is a fast paced, action packed, humorous book. It provides a great new perspective on Corran Horn. I reccomend it to anyone who liked the X-Wing Series or the Jedi Acadamy Trilogy"
3,Adds Depth to Corran Horn's Character,"Corran Horn's personal training in the Jedi academy is explored in this book and his subsequent adventures. The first half of the book repeats the story of Kyp Durron and his involvement in stealing the sun crusher, and the subsequent defeat of Exar-Kun although from the eyes of Corran Horn. This story is original, in that it is narrated in the first person, something unfamiliar in the Star Wars novels.The second part of the story presents a Corran Horn who is not as strict with the law nor as sharp as we thought he was after his CorSec days. This story almost presents a different character than what we saw in the X-Wing series, although it is difficult to say that this was done on purpose to show a different state of mind in the character."
2,I found Corran Horn very annoying in this book.,"What is with this book? The author made Corran Horn to be some omniscient being. He seems to know everything and treats all the other characters like nothing. It's extremely annoying. I knew the book was about Corran Horn, but I didn't expect the author to make the rest of the other characters look so bad. Especially Luke Skywalker. He didn't seem like a Jedi Master in the book, but just some out of place loser. During the book, Corran just seemed to have all the answers for everything. I dont want to read a book about a know-it-all. They didn't need him in the trilogy by Kevin J. Anderson, why do they need him now? This book would have been much better, if it weren't for the fact that Corran Horn is so annoying. If for some reason you're in love with Corran Horn, then buy the book. It is very well written, except I hated the way he made Corran so great."
2,"Nice try, but it falls far short","Mr. Stackpole has apparently spent too much time writing Battletech novels because his characters are too stiff and formal to fit into the Star Wars Universe. It pains me to see a mighty Jedi Master fall and a fascist cop/fighter jock telling him how the Academy should be run and then take off himself to go looking for his wife. Hardly the Knightly ideal. Quite honestly Stackpole has got it wrong about Luke Skywalker- human he may be but not wimpy. I also feel like many readers that this is basically a long self-centred rehash of the Jedi Academy series by Kevin J. Anderson. Wake UP, MIKE!!!!! Do something original! I paid 35 Aussie dollars for THIS?!!!!!"
5,Catholocism at the millenium makes the angels sing!,"While this book is not for the faint of heart or mind, the broad range of perspectives offered captures in an extremely well-written way what is happening within the Catholic Church today and what will likely be happening in the near future. ""Catholicsm at the Millenium"" is written about Catholocism it captures, I believe, the essence of the movements and trends in established religions in general. If your faith and your church are important to you or if you are curious about some of the ways the Catholic Church is changing this book is a must read."
5,My Dinosaur,"This is absolutly one of my favorite books to read to my boys! It's a great fantasy story with a very friendly dinosaur. It's very, very different than any other dinosaur books we read. I think girls would really love it also!"
5,instant favorite,"from the first time i read this enchanting book to my 2yr old son, we both loved it. he talked about it all the time and we read it at nap time and bedtime every day for two weeks (library book), then we had to get it again and he still loved it just as much.it is simple enough to let both our imaginations play. it made me think of when i was a little girl imagining i had large animal friends and i loved to think that my son was having that same kind of feeling as we read. there is nothing negative in the story or scary or confusing. it is a great story of adventure, just the kind of adventure kids already love to pretend.i went ahead and bought it because i look forward to my new baby girl loving it just as much as my son does."
5,RETRACTABLE HOSE 5 STAR RATING,"Bought this hose reel because I am tired of lugging a big hose around which I don't put away as it is too much trouble. This product works great, retracts fully every time ( I am using the flexogen 100' ). Would like it if the box was dark green or brown to blend in better. Plan to paint it. Pleased enough with this retractable reel to have bought two more for other areas of my garden which is quite large. 5 star rating."
5,Great item,This is a great product. It is so simple to wind the hose back up. Especially for older people with arthritis. I would recommend this product for anyone.No Crank Crate 125' Water Powered Retractable Garden Hose Reel #RS12581
5,Daughter's opinion,"We bought this for our daughter this Christmas (upon her request!) and she hasn't even opened it yet but knows, of course, what it is. I know she'll love it as she takes care of her yard and garden in California."
1,JUNK,I've had two for about two years. Had problems from the get-go. One quit winding early fall without manual help. The other broke a gear tooth after a month and barely works. Think I will take them out for target practice with my 12ga. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!
4,Works smooth as silk,"I really like this thing! My only concern with buying it was that it might not be happy while winding up a hose that had picked up debris - such as bark mulch and grass clippings - while dragging itself back to the storage reel. No need for concern. It very nicely does the job, bark chips and all. My yard is small, but I use 75 feet of high-quality hose, which reels up with no problem. I set the white exhaust hose near a rose bush that just loves water, so the ""exhaust"" water does not go to waste. I have two reasons for the four star rating: the hose leading into the unit is of VERY poor quality and will need to be replaced soon or the kinks will drive me nutty; the unit does not come with ground stakes to hold it firmly in place. For the price of $85, both of those items should be covered."
1,This is a totally flawed product,"I purchased this product and almost immediately had problems. The hose would not stay on track and required that I open the top lid and pull it out. Then the handle to shift between rolling up the hose and allowing the hose to be taken out broke.I contacted the company on two occasions and never received a response. Never have I written a product review on line but this product is so unabashedly worthless that I have felt compelled to share my experience. Run, don't walk."
1,Works good initially and then FAILS,"This item seemed incredibly wonderful at the outset. However during its second season it started being difficult to pull out. There were lots of tugging thumping noises. After that started, it would not rewind without my opening the unit and hand rolling the 100 foot no kink hose all the way inside. I would not recommend this to anyone considering the cost of purchase and the short lifetime of use."
2,Stops working after one year,"This item delivers as promised with few minor glitches. My units have both leaked a bit, and the initial connection is somewhat difficult. Yes the hose is neatly re-wound, but both of my carefully stored units do not work well this year. They both require assistance to rewind, yes you must open the lid and assist with a tug on the wheel every one to two turns. That is not to much fun especially if the sharp edges on the wheel cut your fingers. Anyway if you check with the manufacturer, even though their phone states they are closed during their stated business hours you can leave a e-mail message and order parts (if you know what you need) on their website at www.no-crank.com.Good Luck!"
5,This little beauty saves lots of elbow grease. works smoothly,This operates efficiently and every time. I have had another one for 10 years and it is still going
1,Bad Design..Does not last,I bought 2 of these 3 years ago. The first year it worked great. Last year the units had problems rewinding. This year 1 unit will not rewind at all and I had to take the other unit apart to get the hose off it was so tangled. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
5,Great hose reel,"I have a bad back and have a lot of trouble bending over and to crank a hose reel is all but impossible and not worth the risk of worsening my back problems. I already have one reel, so this is my second-One in the front and one in the back. I have tried other reels because I could not find another ""reel smart"". after two other reels, I am back to the reel smart reel which has a proven track record with me. Slide a lever and the reel does all the work. It works best if you secure it somehow so it can't move while it retracts. Great reel!"
2,A low-quality novelty,"It does work, but that is about as good as it gets. The quality of the materials used is quite low. I found that you sometimes have to pull pretty hard to unwind the hose which can be annoying. The worse problem is that I had this product for about 2 months and it already has a serious internal leak. These were summer months (no freeze occurred). My next step is to just throw it away and start over with a better product."
1,"Great Idea, Flimsy material","Ok, We thought we had finally found the solution to reeling in the hose! We bought one, tried it, loved it, and bought 3 more! Alas, a lack! The lever to flip broke after just one summer's use. This is the essential lever to rewind. We mailed the company a check for the replacement part. The check was never cashed, and the company never responded. We cannibalized one of the more infrequently used ones. After a few months, that lever also broke.Now we are researching hose reels that work, are not much hassle, and that are built with quality materials. Maybe you could buy this hose reel if you plan to use it just once or twice a year. Might last you a bit then. :p Me, I feel robbed."
4,Where's the Warranty?,"I just received the hose reel which I bought through Amazon. I used a Visa card with which I could double the warranty period. There was no warranty information listed on Amazon for it, but I figured it would be in the manual. Wrong. Zip, nothing, nada. O.k., so I called the manufacturer. Remarkably, the representative was clueless ... she referred me to the manufacturer's web page which, again, had no information about the warranty (if there even is one). You have to wonder about a product for which there is either no warranty or the manufacturer isn't inclined to publish and disseminate it."
2,Not so hot...,"I collect Roy Loney...with the flaming grovvies and more. Actaully filmed him play at the EMU Ballroom in late 80's with my friends band: ""The Nads"" backing him up! He was awesome!!!But I fear that he is struggling with the world as much as the rest of us old rockers...and cannot say I'd buy this again."
5,Great Ska Album!,"This album has a great song selection from some relatively unknown ska bands.Dream Girl, Cable, Distress and many other great songs that could have been pretty big radio hits had they been given the attention they deserved.Definitely recommended to any fans of ska and reggae music."
5,Easy Steps To Success!,"Healthy, Wealthy, & Wise was a great read. KRS Edstrom shares the secrets to some of the most successful business people of recent times. This is an ""A to Z"" list of what helped propel these people to the top.Wonderful fun for anyone interesting in comparing their habits to those of some of America's most successful."
4,Excellent as always,"John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee books are something that current authors should try to emulate. They are usually 250 pages long, actually give the reader food for thought and tell a good story. There is no padding in the book, no gratuitous sex scenes (although Travis meets heaps of women) and violence is kept to a minimum.In this novel, Travis is approached by an old friend in need of help. The story centres around the search for a man who has gone missing, presumed dead but doubts have arisen over the possible large insurance payout and rumours that the man is hiding out in Mexico.This leads to Travis and Meyer setting out to gather more information and at the same time, making interesting observations about the human condition (a trademark of MacDonald's writings).Warmly recommended."
3,"Learned a little about a lot, good for the bathroom","I spent my mornings from April 2001 to April 2002 reading each days entry in this book. I certainly learned quite a bit from it. I felt like Cliffy from Cheers some mornings at work. I enjoyed the book, but not every day was a winner. The story about the Crocodile attack on the Japanese troops in World War II was amazing.The only disappointment was the neglecting of King Solomon, the bible mentions him as one of the greatest Natural Historians ever. Oh well, I'm pretty sure the author is an atheist anyhoo."
2,"Nothing special, but typical of the serials' waning days","This 1950 serial adventure stars Kirk Alyn, more familiar as the star of the ""Superman"" serials. This has Alyn in civilian clothes, taking on villain John Merton and thwarting his plans at every turn. By this time the Republic studio was no longer paying license fees for established superheroes, so this is a generic cops-and-robbers story with the standard number of fights and chases, but without any really distinguishing characteristics. Serial collectors may want to see this because of Alyn; if you've never seen a serial, try an older Republic title first."
5,Single-handedly restores your faith in original jazz vocals!,This is a terrific set - the songs sparkle and the performances are so true! Mose's perspective shines through on every song - and he's so HUMAN!! Everything he sings about is (or will be!) universal. Here's a man who knows the blues inside and out - he's got something to say!
3,Memory,"This the original the only memory card that works with my camera, a little expensive but no choice if You don't want to get rid of your old camera."
5,Best current reference on Arabic,"In 39 crisp chapters covering more than 700 pages Ryding organizes both the grand lines and essential details of Arabic language structure and grammar. This is a highly readable, easily searched linguistic reference. The index really does the job and her list of references alone is a significant academic contribution. Finally, this gem will make life easier for both students of Arabic and researchers. All my thumbs are up for this once in a lifetime linguistic treasure."
5,One of a kind,"Karin Ryding has done a truly amazing job putting together a thorough, well-researched and accessible reference grammar of contemporary standard Arabic. There is really no other way to describe this book but in superlatives. It is a must-have for any learner or scholar of Arabic. In terms of comprehensiveness, accessibility and clarity, it has no competition on the current book market - not only here in the US, but worldwide, including in the Arab world (yes, I know what I am saying). Fifty years from now, it will still be the classic source on contemporary grammar. And, given the sheer immensity of undertaking a project like this one, I am afraid in half a century it may still be the *only* source on contemporary grammar. It takes serious guts to attempt a book of this magnitude. Not many scholars would dare put their expertise to this kind of test. I am glad she did.I'd give it six stars if I could."
2,I am so frustrated with this gate!!,"I wish I could send this thing back, but I threw the box away and have kept it too long, trying to get it to work out, but now I'm done w/it. I can't get the bottom bar to stay secure. The gate is good in theory, but I have an active and curious baby, and he's always trying to go underneath it because the lower bar won't stay put. I feel like I wasted the $30 I spent on this gate."
2,Disappointed,"I was very excited when I read about and ordered this product, but it did not live up to my expectations. Maybe it was because our tub is too curved, but I could not secure the bottom bar. (I was able to secure the top bar though.) Anyway, it does not fit ALL standard tubs and tub openings 19 - 26 inches, as advertised. Too bad!"
2,Not as secure as needs to be,"The bars tighten but loosen when the tub gets wet, my 14 month old has been able to pull the thing down and has on one occasion used the top bar to pull herself up causing the thing to collapse sending her face down into the water, could have been very dangerous. If using this, ALWAYS be within arms reach. Disappointing."
3,I expected a more modern fragrance,"i bought this one for my daughter but it would be better directed towards my grandmother. Its not bad but its also not interesting. same old same old. Since I have always been happy with DK fragrances, I imagined this would be the case. Since the price was attractive, my disappointment was not overwhelming."
1,This book is not recommended,"Any book which recommends buying a puppy from a pet store or from a ""neighborhood breeder"" is not to be recommended."
1,Written to make money for authors,"Yes, this book is used at the Naval Academy. I am a Midshipman there who has just finished my junior leadership course, and I HATE THIS BOOK. It's written for academics and theorists, not practitioners. If you removed the parenthetical citations, the page count of this book would probably be cut in half. I'm sorry that I don't have an alternative for you, but if you actually want to learn how to lead people, the first step is not buying this book."
2,Useless!,"This book is required reading for the Leadership course in my MBA program, but I am embarrassed to be seen with this book in my hands.The text is about 200 pages longer than it needs to be, and doesn't introduce anything really new or insightful to any adult who has ever held a job (certainly not useful for the MBA students). To top it off, the text is BORING!I instantly questioned the credibility of this textbook when I first noticed all too many grammatical blunders, and then saw that it uses WIKIPEDIA as a SOURCE! Unless something has changed recently, any research I submitted with traces of Wiki on it would be thrown out...but it's OK for a textbook publisher to use it?"
3,TO ANY STUDENTS BUYING USED EDITIONS,THIS IS TO INFORM STUDENTS THAT ARE BUYING USED EDITIONS OF ANY TEXTBOOK: PLEASE READ THE DESCRIPTIONS THE SELLER POSTS AND ASK THE SELLER IF IT IS AN INTERNATIONAL EDITION. THE ISBNS ARE DIFFERENT AND SO IS THE QUALITY OF THE TEXT. IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO RESELL THESE KINDS OF BOOKS.
4,book review,Very good and very informative book. Highly recommended for people taking higher level of leadership roles in any academic profession.
4,"a lush, heartfelt aural wonder","who the hell is Josh Rouse and how did he get inside me like that? Josh's plaintive, sweetly naive tenor is juxtaposed by a rich, sonic backdrop of haunting feedback and wurlitzer that gives an emotional power to his lyrics,yet never cocoons them. Pain and longing are the stuff of these watercolors, and the mesmerizing, subtle arrangments remind me a bit of Chris Whitley's best work on ""Living with the Law"". But you cannot pigeon-hole Rouse's work very easily. His lyrics are so personal that the listener at times feels almost an eavesdropper. In ""The White Trash Period of My Life"" the simple refrain, ""happy and willing to die for your love.."" becomes tremendously moving. David Henry's production--most of the album was recorded in his home studio--is just about perfect. Dressed Up Like Nebraska haunts me, and if you lend him your ears, Josh Rouse will haunt you, too."
4,a pretty good record,"this album is pretty good. it is sometimes a little slow. but, the texture of it is really pinpoint. it just gets into you somehow and grabs hold. its minamalist pop but seemingly intense at times. its a good one to put on and read or relax or drive to. its a good record."
2,"Nebraska may be dressed up, but it's got no where to go","The monontony of the production of this record kills me. I heard Rouse live on the radio, and was really impressed by ""Nebraska"" and ""L.N. Conversation,"" but there's a real sameness that permeates the record. Sure, he's got that great R. Smith/Cure pop guitar strum/singsong melodies (which makes those two songs so infectious), but any sense of newness peters out very quickly over a long player. I think the problem is the album has a flatness to it; there is a serious lack of dynamics to the song structures. This record probably works best when you don't have to listen to it the whole way through - a song here and there would stand out next to other/different kind of music. I know a previous reviewer favorably compared this record to Whiskeytown's ""Stranger's Almanac"", Freedie , M. Eitzel, E. Smith - no way, no how, no sir. This release is not in the same league as the recent releases by those artists."
3,It's not all that,"I thought the song writing on this album would be a lot better. If all you want is good background music when you're sitting with you flannel-wearing date and drinking a few beers, this is the CD for you. It has a consistent feel to it, and there are nice arrangements. However, I've been into Whiskeytown and Richard Buckner lately and this guy doesn't compare. The songs sound very similar and go exactly where you'd expect them to, just like ear candy should. If you have the cash to spare, buy it. If you're short on cash like me and have to choose your purchases wisely, be careful."
5,"Outstanding, Sublime, Wonderful","Hate Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears et al.? Want to support a real artist? BUY THIS ALBUM IMMEDIATELY. Thank you."
3,Your cat will be super soft!,"The palatability of this product is not great. We can only get one of our cats to eat it, and she doesn't love it, but will tolerate it if we really mix it into her food. We bought this product solely as a skin and coat supplement, and to boost the omega 3s in our cats' diet, so I can't comment on its other potential benefits. Although flax is not super species appropriate, this stuff REALLY works to make their coat smooth and soft. That cat that will eat it is a 3 year old Siamese mix with a medium length coat. People always are amazed at how soft she is. I have some friends who feed this as well, and their cats' coats are just as soft! This took about a month of daily feeding to see a major difference in her coat quality. I give it 3 stars because I wish the omega source was something like fish oil, but we haven't had the same results in coat improvement with plain fish oil as we have with this product."
3,I'd know more if the cat had liked it,"I tried giving this to our 18-year-old cat. He's about as picky as a cat can be, and he didn't like the vitamins. I could not find a way to get him to ingest any of it (putting it in food, mixing it with water, etc). It looked like a fantastic product and I had high hopes for it, but there is no getting around a cat who's made up his mind."
2,Can't say because cats wouldn't eat it,"For three weeks, I diligently added this to my cats' wet food in the hopes of improving the one cat's digestion/elimination troubles. They ate it... reluctantly at first, then not at all. It's incredibly rare for my cats to not eat their wet food, but by week 3 of this stuff, that was our world. Also, strange side effect that I can only attribute to this--one of the cats started having tiny pellet stool instead of well-formed stool. Between those two things, we've officially stopped using the product. On to the next supplement..."
5,Love Tony!,"If you are a huge Tony Danza fan, as I am, you will find his biography enjoyable to watch, and it will be one of your cherished favorite videos in your library."
2,Memory foam wanting,"I sent these back as I purchased them for the comfort of the memory foam insole, which was very thin and not very comfortable. Very disappointing after searching long for what I thought was going to be a great slipper."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Flimsy and more flimsy after they were washed. These slippers would be good for someone who cannot fit into a regular slipper because their foot is swollen but for a regular everyday slipper, they do not grip the foot and I kept walking out of them."
2,expwcted a better product,"I looked forward to getting a very comfortable pair of slippers. Unfortunately they ran big and the cord covering the open edges was abrasive and unpleasant. The support in the sole was good, but I needed a pair I could wear. I ordered two pair of Daniel Green slippers at the same time and they both had the rough cording around the edges. I won't order another pair of their slippers. I did appreciate the refund. The second pair also had no support, was a flat sole with not much there."
4,Shoes for Grandma,We love these shoes! We love having the adjustable strap at the toes to make a snug fix. They are extremely soft. They are a bit pricey for slippers. Very thick sole which is great for support and the elderly.
2,Incorrectly sized,"As said above for the Daniel Green Tess slipper, these definitely are NOT a narrow - they are much too wide."
4,DANIEL GREEN WM'S TARA REVIEW,"DANIEL GREEN SLIPPERS ARE WELL CONSTRUCTED COMFORTABLE AND PRACTICAL DUE TO ABILITY OF ""WASHABLE""JUDGING OF CORRECT SIZE NEEDED WAS HARD TO GUESS. I REQUIRED RETURN TO AMAZON - PLUS HAD TO PAY MAILING FEE- TO HAVE CORRECT SIZE SENT."
1,eyes all puff,minus 1 StarShiny no more..Wack StillHmmmmmm I used to respect G-Dep and a Few others that appeared on this LP... A Shame..
1,Done,SEAN COMBS....I will never call him that other name he goes by. LETS SAY THE SAGA STOPS HERE. SEAN MAY BE A GOOD BUSINESS MAN BUT HE IS NOT A RAPPER............. SEAN YOU SHOULD THANK BIGGIE EVERY NIGHT YOU LAY YOUR HEAD DOWN AND GO TO SLEEP...........GREG LASSITERwww.misguidedproduction.com
5,Bad Boy 4 Life!!,This cd is straight fire.. Everything bad bay does is fire!! I can't wait till Faith drops her joint!!
4,P Diddy Tha Saga Continues : Best Hip -Hop Album,"This Album could not be better the first single Bad Boy 4 life gets mad radio time.Another song is the DIDDY a track produced by the Neptunes which will help bring in units.Other songs that are hot are Tha Saga continues , Where Sean?, Shiny Suit Man (The Lox Diss),Toe Game.The Hottest track on the album is That's Crazy ft Black Rob, G-dep, and P Diddy.It's like Whoa but instead they say That's Crazy.To all readers this not you typical BAD BOY ALBUM!!Hottest Album since Nelly Country Grammar & Jay-Z Hard Knock Life.A must buy for True Hip-Hop Lovers !!"
2,Below Average!,"If your gonna make a cd with 25 tracks on it, then you need to make more than three or four good tracks. Nuff Said!"
1,Wackness!,"I don't care what anyone thinks, P. Diddy, Puff Daddy, Puffy, Puff The Magic Dragon (or whatever he's calling himself these days) can't rap! He is definately one of the most overrated rap ""artist"" (if you can call what he does ""art""). I was a young white country kid when I first heard this dude...and back then, I thought he couldn't rhyme himself out of a wet paper bag. With this new album of his, I haven't heard much improvement in his rap skills. That's my feel on the lyrical portion of the album. As for the beats: I wasn't impressed at all. It sounds like he ripped off his beats from my kid brother's Children's Sing Along tapes. I hope for the sake of hip hop culture P. Diddy's Saga doesn't continue after this album."
1,Most overated and over the hill act ever,"Perhaps Puffy only got as far as he could riding on Biggie's legacy, but lets face it, he really has very little talent, charisma, charm and just seems so dull, he is basically a male Paris Hilton, going around acting like the world's biggest d1ck ny saying ""look people, I got money, arent I cool"" besides Biggie(RIP), Bad Boy really is not great, most of the artists are poor quality, The production is awful and no one has not even shown potetial. This album is basically not even worth printing or existing. It is just sad that many great underground rappers are not getting any attention while garbage like Diddy plague are airwaves and puts his dumb face everywhere on TV. I don't know why people like Tupac, Biggie, Dimebag, Chuck Shuldiner and countless other greats are buried but this guy still breaths. So I would say in conclusion that we should do what people like chingy and D4L deserve, a 1 star rating."
2,ummmmm no,"The only reason I gave this album 2 stars is becasue I feel the track with Carl Thomas and Faith Evans. As far as the rest of the average... your usual P Diddy bs. If you feel this type of commercial hiphop then this may be the album for you, but if you into deep hiphop and you know hiphop then I would have to say dont get this."
3,hey stupid,"who is the idiot that wrote REVOLUTIONARY, dr.dre wrote the chronic and the album is okay but u should download it."
1,Bad Boy Sux,I Have not heeard this album but i don't have to. If you are associated with Bad boy Records in anyway and your name is not Notorious B.I.G you are the reason the rap game is in bad shape right now. Where would Puff Daddy or P.Diddy or whatever his name is be without 2pac callin him out on his album's. Puffy your nothing but a punk who is still rideing the Biggie Smalls wave. You are a untalented rapper who wants to be famous again
3,Puff daddy,"This ain't nuthin special, afew hot tracks but most of it is trash.Hot tracks:Bad Boy For LifeCan't BelieveBack For Good Now"
1,"Stick to being an Executive Producer,Clothing Line Designer","Besides track 10,11,18,23 the CD is whack, Eightball,MJG, and Faith Evans bailed you out, either it would had been another dust collector, no disrespect to you P-Diddy, you have the tightest clothing line on the market today, I buy everything that they put in the stores that is made affordable, but your music is best left to your artist like the Lox, Faith Evans ect..... Plus get with the R&B groove Hardcore is nice, Hip Hop Is nice but R&B is lovely"
5,Phat lyrics,I am very suprised. This is the hottest CD on the streets. I you like nice tracks BUY IT !!!!
3,Bad Boy,"i used to like bad boy music but since biggie died and mase left, bad boy is [...]. nO WAy out was a good record but afta that p diddy was a sell out. wid losin da name he lost his talent. in da 90's he used to be my favourite but now he a big headed dik. mark curry is [...] black rob is a dik loon is ok but not on dis record. pop rap is good but p diddy just has too take it one further. i didn't rate dis 1 star cos p diddy was once a good rapper/producer/business man."
5,Get this album NOW!!!!!!!!!!,This is the best album of the year. Everyone needs to go and cop this album now. It don't have a bad song on it. you can listin to it all the way through and never skip a track. it is the best. P diddy and the bad boy family for life.
1,WARNING WARNING WARNING,"DO NOT BUY THIS CD if you are going to copy it to your computer and make an MP3 file. It contains the music distortion scheme from Macrovision. This inserts popping and cracking sounds when you make the backup. They are slightly noticable when you play the CD but really annoying on the backup. The higher quality the audio equipment the more noticable the distortion.According to Macrovision, the company that has provided the technology to several major music labels, the test has been going on for four to six months. Although it's not disclosing just which titles have been loaded with the technology, at least one has sold close to 100,000 copies, the company said.I have talked to two other owners of this CD with the same problem. What a horrible thing to do to such beautiful music."
1,utter pap,anything that's got anything to do with the commercial facade that is p diddy has got to be utter and complete pap. I genuinely hope it's only a matter of time before everyone realises this.0 stars.
1,Why God Why????????????????,Why Do You Allow P.Diddy To Put Out A Cd. I Ask You To Feed Starving Children But You Dont Have Time. I Ask You To Heal My Scizophrenia But You Wont But At Least Stop P.Diddy From Making Music. Please I'm In Pain.
1,WOW...,"After I heard Snoops ""da game is to be sold, not to be told"" I thought i would never hear a worse hip hop album. I was wrong. This cd is a peice of crap and it should only be sold 4 about $1.00. If u want real rap, listen to Dre, Pac, Or biggie. They are all tight. Unlike this sellout."
1,For shame P Diddy...for shame.,"P Diddy?It sounds like something out of Donkey Kong. But then knowing Sean Combes he probably did rip it off someone else. This sad attempt at music, crossed with his endless, yet futile crusade to portray himself as a 'hard man' only reinforces the fact that he is a fool. Maybe if Puffy began to make his own music rather than covering classic songs, then maybe he would have respect.This record only furthers his fall from grace."
1,THIS IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!,"I'm still wondering why I bought this stupid record. I should have known it was going to be bad since it was by ""P.Diddy"". Every song on here is unbearable except for ""Let's Get It"" and the okay ""Bad Boy For Life"".The other 23 tracks...are just pure junk. Skip this dumb and pointless CD and don't even think of buying the remix version. Both were made for money and nothing else."
4,I actually listened to the CD!,"That's right. Amazingly, their are people who make assumtions about this disc because of the artist. Well, let me tell you these assumtions are all wrong, and why you should by this disc:1.All PD talks about is money. Wrong. In most tracks he talks about life experiences (ie the trial, J-Lo, God etc) Cheak I Need A Girl, and On Top. Why can other artist talk about what's real to them and Diddy can't.2.It's all dance music. Wrong. If he wanted to do that their would be samples. On this album, Puff strays from his previous sampling mode.3.The rapers have no skill. Well, that's a judgement call (Loon is cool, but not a convincing Ma$e). But I promise U let's Get it is only the surface of G-Dep's talent.This is really a good album. Not great, but equal to NWO. No this isn't inspiring music (ie. Mos Def or Kweli) but it is what it aspires to be. Like Mase said ""sold 4 million, somebody got to love it"""
3,Typical P.Diddy,"This CD is tight, but if youre lookin for deep rhymes go look somewhere else. This is a Puffy CD, amazing beats with not too much goin on lyrically. While some of the songs are carried by his others like B.Rob and Curry, Puffy isnt a great rapper and it shows on this CD as he recycles old rhymes. At leats now he isnt recycling beats, and the ones of this album are great to party and drive to.This is a great CD to throw on while youre driving, hanging out, or driving, but if youre big on lyrical prowess and content leave this one alone"
4,P.Diddy does it again,This cd is one not the best but i like it. It has 8 good songs. Including bad boy 4 life with hot lyrics by diddy. Lets get it which is my favorite.diddy has a tight beat and lyrics except da chorus is lame.Blast of has a nice beat. t game is reallly funny. I neeed a girls is an overall good song except didddy uses the same rhymes a couple of times.You have all heard cant believe.And those r all good songs.Diddy did a good job. p.s. i like incomplete.
3,A solid album.,"If I could rate this album from tracks 1-8, I would have given it four stars. After that, there are some great tracks, but they are intertwined with mediocre ones as well. All in all, it is a solid effort from P.Diddy, but the excitement wanes as the album goes on."
2,No more please!,"Let me start this review off by saying I'm a poor college student with a SUV, I should have filled my tank rather than buying this. I got burned by FOREVER, but for some reason I thought it wouldn't happen this time after I heard the two tracks bumping on the radio (thus the two stars) if puffy releases any more albums after this I'll be surprised. It just goes to show how much Big did for their rap game. Disappointing buy the new Alicia Keys album or anything other than this garbage!"
1,Bad Puffy Album,"It's really not good. Very bad lyrics and weak Beats, that's an awful Album. A lot of things have Changed with the Beats and Guest Rappers, but it has changed and it sucks! Bad Boy Records is better in R'n'B than Rap now, with 112 and Dream, but in Rap they are behind all other Rap Labels. So if you like Bad Boy, buy 112, and if you like Rap, buy Lil' Romeo or Redman."
5,Old Time Sake,"Very Cool to drive with it.Back in the days of '95 when me & my homies playing Basket Ball, We used to listen this at the playground."
2,The only enjoyable part was the story...,"First off, let me make this clear, I read this book as an asignment for an Apologetics class I was taking, so my opinion could be biased as no teenager in highschool wants to read books like this. HahahaBut on a more serious note, I find Josh McDowell's writing style to be a bit dry and somewhat of a bore. As I stated in my title, the story was the only semi-entertaining part. Of course this book was not made for entertainment but to get you to think deeper on such matters as beliefs and convictions. The only problem was that I didn't need to think deeper while reading this book, because everything in it I had already been told by teachers, parents, or other books. I definately did not get out of this book what I had hoped for!In fact I was glad when my teacher told me that we didn't have to read the last few chapters!"
1,Disappointed in Audio CD,"Josh McDowell is a great speaker with passion and conviction. Having his book read by a professional voice, in a monotone style, does not work for this product. Save the money and order Josh McDowell's presentation from Focus on the Family for $5. It is much better, has the same content, only spoken with conviction by the author himself."
3,Enjoyable.,"Coalesce, Give Them Rope (Edison, 2000)Short. Fast. Croaking. Weird attempts to shove lyrics into places they definitely do not belong. It's turn-of-the-century American hardcore. Some positively catchy riffs, impressionist lyrics (look them up, don't bother trying to understand), and solid rhythm. Likable. ***"
5,Coalesce pull no punches.,"This is amazing. Coalesce is the most original, most innovative, most talented, most brutal hardcore band ever, and this album is truly a work of art. The complex chords and the spectacular drum work make this an aural masterpiece (but only if you can truly appreciate music like this). To truly grasp the talent of this band, you have to see them live. Just watch the guitarist and the bassist play. You will be amazed. My favorite album of all time."
2,Not for n64 controllers,"I tried 4 different N64 controllers on my computer using this cable. It didn't work at all, the joystick moved on it's own and the buttons sometimes pressed automatically. But if you want to take your chances, go for it. That's what I did."
1,Doesn't Work,"The complaints above are accurate. It is not a matter of knowing how to calibrate the controller once you use this Adaptor. You cannot calibrate the controller because the Adapator inccorectly signals to the computer that buttons are being depressed and the N64 joystick is being moved. And, just to be clear, I purchased a new controller to use in conjunction with this adator, so it is, by no means, a result of the controller.You can take your chances. Apparently some people have had it work, but I am not in the lucky group."
3,Be Very Very Wary,"This is the third one of these that I have purchased, and two of the three arrived defective. I am infuriated, but the fact that one works fine makes me desire to continue trying to find another working one"
3,Eh..,"Shipping was late, but worked perfect when I first got it. Shortly after the Playstation part broke. But the N64 part works just fine still."
3,works perfect with ps2 controllers...n64 not so much,"The only problem I had with this was that when I tried to use the n64 controller, it does it soft, so instead of running...you walk, but the ps2 worked fine...so if you only want it for n64 and cant do with the ps2, then I wouldn't recommend getting this...I do have windows XP and it was plug and play for me."
2,Good and bad.,It is a good device and it works well but the N64 analog stick does not work right. If I knew who the manafactor of it I might be able to find a web sight and see if there is any drivers for it.
1,I have read better Social Stratification books.,"I feel that this book does not go into depth about stratification of class and groups as much as it should, I used this book for a college class and did not like it. I think that other books on Social Stratification are much better than this one. The author jumps aroung issues instead of discussing them, and uses redundant termanology throughout a sentence, paragraph and even chapters. Throughout this book when the author trys to make a point the reader can become lost and confused due to the author dancing around the main point (or Issue) by using terms like, ""By and Large"" and many others to complete a thought, that render the sentence unintelligable. I think that the editors are also to blame they should have deleted that redundant statements made throughtout the book when necessary. Other than that I do not believe that this book should be used on a college level for Sociology."
3,missing link,"We have been using this with multiple dogs for a couple of years, and I'm unsure how much of a positive effect is has or does not have on the dogs. I don't think it has any effect on their digestive issues ([...]) and maybe it's because I have GSDs, but I don't think it reduced their shedding either. My dogs still have allergic reactions, etc. However, I'm sure the added vitamins and minerals are good for them. After this current 5lb bag is gone, I am going to stop feeding it to my dogs and see if there is a significant difference."
5,This product has improved the health of my dog!!!,"If your dog has any type of skin disease, such as Lupus, this will help...you will see a difference in a matter of months....best supplement out there!"
3,So far so good,I haven't used enough of the product to give a full review yet. So far the dogs like it added to their food. They have nice coats but still some dryness. I am hoping by the time we finish the bag I will see results.
3,Vigor and coat improved but itching continues.,My lab has always followed on our daily walks while my toller was covering the 40 acres in front of me. After a week on the formula she is out in front and romping with the other dog. The itching has not improved but her coat is getting shiny again. I hope I can get this to 5 stars before I finish this 5 lbs. My vet said there must have been something in the ML formula that she was lacking and continue with it.
5,Great video! Fast delivery!,I really enjoy this DVD and recomend it to anyone that is interested in yoga!
2,Dissapointment!,"She must be a good yoga instructor, but to deliver the yoga on video there must be more . More enlightment, more energy, more empathy, more charisma. I made a mistake to order this, having Paul Grilley and Sara Powers for yin yoga, is perfect."
3,something to aspire to,"This is NOT a DVD for a beginner, so perhaps my rating would be higher if I weren't one. There isn't any instruction given for proper alignment or pose description. If you aren't familiar with the sanskrit names of poses, you will be lost or constantly looking at the television and trying to figure out what is going on. For those practitioners that really know their stuff, this DVD will be a nice addition to your collection. This is a DVD that I would like to be able to follow along with someday, but for now, I need to concentrate on learning the individual poses and how to correctly move from one pose to another without injuring myself. While the flow portion of the DVD is beyond a beginner level,I do think the Yin session would be useful for all levels."
4,Great intro to Yin yoga,"This DVD served as my introduction to Yin yoga -- very slow, very deep (supposed to access and work on connective tissue), relaxing, and quite different from my regular Kundalini routine. In short: I like the ""yin"" portion of Donna Helm-Yost's set as a kind of occassional practice, to balance and juxtapose against the more active yoga I do most days. This DVD is worth the second set alone!"
3,Academic approach,Nearly finished this book but thought I would share my comments now.The book is written very much for someone who already knows about Lawrence's life and is adding this to their collection.It doesn't seem to take into account that you might actually want to read about his life and be kept in some suspense about what will happen. He jumps back and forth in time quite a lot in the beginning because he tends to first discuss a period in high level before then dealing with it in a chapter. Very annoying as if you're reading a masters thesis which lays outall its conclusions at the beginning and the rest of the book is an attempt to back up those statements. Takes a lot of the fun out of the read.I read recently Rice's biography of Capt. Sir Richard Francis Burton and this really demonstrated a much better way of presenting a biography.
1,Terrible oboe reed,I guess for 8 bucks you can't expect much. Well that's certainly true in this case. An absolutely lousy oboe reed and no amount of scraping will make it decent. Bad responsiveness and flat top octave notes. Stay away is all I can say.
4,After Dark - Richard Elliot,Richard Elliot is one of my favorite saxophonists. There is absolutely nothing else to say about this artist except that he is brilliant.
3,Synaesthesia - 'Embody' (Cleopatra),"Looks to be the band's first CD.I,personally liked it better than it's follow-up,'Desideration'(see my review).Simply more idealistic industrial/electronic to fully experience.Tracks that I was semi-impressed with were ""Outland"", the atmospheric ten-minute ""New Horizons"" (perhaps the CD's best cut) and ""Floatation"". I guess electronica isn't exactly my favorite genre, but if I'm in the right mood,I can get into this. Big-time fans of such should get more from this CD than I did."
5,How much better can it get...,"This CD sounds better every time I listen to it. It is AMAZING. You will instantly recognize that Bill & Rhys did these songs (signature sound). Each song really has a different tempo, structure, and overall ""feel,"" but they all flow together nicely. Possibly my favorite all-instrumental CD."
3,Explore the dark side...,"I purchased both Embody and Ephemeral at the same time and definitely find Ephemeral the better of the two. Embody is just a little too dark/cold, and I find I get irritated by some of the songs; they seem too repetetive and go on a little too long (starts grating on the nerves); although I can't get track 3 out of my mind which I feel is absolutely beautiful!I also own Delerium's Karma and Semantic Spaces and to me there may be similarities in the 2 groups' styles but they definitely put me in different headspaces. Delerium is more upbeat and great for background music at a party, while Synaesthesia is somewhat cold and more appropriate for an session of solitude and introspection. Both groups however, are great for long lonely roadtrips!"
2,Heavier than I expected,"We took this ball to the beach, but it drinks up water and becomes quite heavy. This is not the type of volleyball we were looking for, it was hard on my children's fingers. We ended up buying another, lighter, volleyball that's easier to keep up in the air."
4,good product,"I've been using these for a while now and like them. You just push down on the little button lever thing and the cap pops right open. The only issue I've had with it is that it sometimes doesn't close all the way unless you apply firm pressure to the top. This can be annoying if you are careless while loading up and don't close it all the way so all your paint spills all over the ground. As long as you make sure it is closed all the way, it does work quite well."
5,real good,"I already was fanatic of Reggae when I heard Pato the first time. But he is quite different. A little bit unique. The one you could best compare him with is Damian Marley, but Pato sings his own songs...in fact he's got a great combination of Rhytm, Melodies, Lyrics and Soul. I think, his Music Rhythms are the best of all Reggae Artists.(if my English was bad, please excuse this - it's not my language)"
1,not too bad,"I give this cd 2 out of 5 stars:The only songs I liked on this cd were:'aun hay algo','nuestro amor', 'este corazon', and 'que hay detras'. The rest of the songs weren't that great at all.So overall, I wouldn't recommend buying this cd(nor do I recommend watching the soap opera). Their first cd gets 4 out of 5 stars while this one gets 2 out of 5 stars."
1,"No, no, no...Here we go again!","What is wrong with you guys?!?! These guys can't sing nor act! they are talentless! i mean they are just a bunch of FRESONAS (like those brainless popular girls we see in movies)! Is that the example we want to give to the younger ones? I really don't think so! So, why don't we buy something that can be a good example to the younger ones something that is worth listening and watching, not this kind of crap that is actually a copy of a argentinian soap opera. I mean, when are mexicans going to star and use their own original ideas and actually put some talent on the TV not just a huge butt and a pretty face but real talent?"
1,KELLY CLARKSONNNNNN WHERE ARE UUUU????????,"HEY GUYS......THE SONG CALLED ME VOY ITS A FAKEEEE...THIS IS AN ORGINAL SONG OF KELLY CLARKSON FROM HER BREAKAWAY CD...GONE... HELLO!!!! RBD IS A ""POP BAND"" WHO WAS CREATED BY TELEVISA AND MARKETING....THIS IS LIKE ASHLEE SIMPSON AND MTV IN THE US!!! NOO WAYYYYYYY.....RCA RECORDSSSSS U COULD SUE THIS MEDIOCRE AND OPPORTUNIST MEXICAN ""SINGERS"""
3,Do not spray on your pet,Read the directions before using. This product is for bedding areas. I have not noticed any effects on my dog's excitedness but she seemed OK with the scent (peppermint oil & clove oil).
1,"save your money, not worth it - doesn't work at all",Used it just as directed on bottle and my 3 lb. Chihuahua was still anxious and never stopped shaking. She was panting just as she has done before when it rains and when riding in our car.
4,Seems to work.,"I have used this product for the past 3 days for my dog. He is a chihuahua mix and is very anxious, especially around my boyfriend. My boyfriend, his family and my roommate have all said my dog seems more calm and relaxed. I just spray the product on my dog's blanket and bed in the morning and afternoon. It is much easier than trying to get him to take the pills- he did not like how those tasted! The product does not smell like anything to me. I didn't use it at my boyfriends house, but he said my dog seems more relaxed even when he is there. I'm not sure if it supposed to have lasting effects like this or not."
5,It's Just Great! Never Leave Home Without It.,"I've had a tiny toy poodle since he was 5 wks. old and who's now 3 yrs old. He's been my traveling companion since he was ""potty broke"" at 6 wks. I spray this product on his safety seat and blanket liner shortly before leaving for one of our travels and it works just great. He's very calm and sleeps most of the time. Even when he's awake, he just sits up in his seat and looks around with no noise whatsoever. I've tried the ""paste"", but it doesn't sit well in his little tummy, so just use the spray and ""all is well"". I never leave home without a bottle in my truck and also keep one in the house to make sure we are never without it.Quiet Moments Natural Herbal Calming Spray for Dogs and Puppies"
1,Boooo,"It is supposed to calm my dog....but you have to get him to sit in the same spot. I guess it would be good if I could just put him in the cage, but he wont stop barking. I had to get something stronger"
1,quiet moments,it never worked my 4 year old dog didn't calm down he ran from any area I sprayed lol so this will not work on a wild coco dog
3,good smell,this has a nice smell not very strong but it has zero affect on my two yorkies. I stopped using it about a week after I bought it because it was just wasted time.
1,Doesn't Work,This didn't work for us. I sprayed it on my dogs stuff and I couldn't see any difference in her behavior at all.
4,Excellent big band jazz,"These two 1960 performances by the Jones big band are top-notch, especially the one in Switzerland. Personnel vary between the two, but Phil Woods is the standout soloist on both, although Melba Liston, Clark Terry, Patti Bown, Jerome Richardson, Julius Watkins, and Benny Bailey are among the other musicians offering satisfying improvisations as well. Worthwhile listening, especially for fans of big band jazz. Very good audio and video quality."
5,quincy jones- live in 60 (jazz icons),"I've enjoyed the album of this group for 40 years. To see it on dvd is incredible and totally ""cooking""."
5,Quincy Jones Live in '60,What a great band Quincy put together. Of all the bands of that era that was one of the best.Ron Chambers
5,Bedtime Routine,"My Sheltie gets her teeth brushed every night as part of the bedtime routine. She actually runs to the bathroom when I tell her, ""Time to brush your teeth"". She loves it and has been getting her teeth brushed since she was a puppy. My cat also comes running to get some licking off my finger. We use Poultry and Malt flavours and are going to try the Vanilla Mint. Just like with people, if an animals teeth aren't healthy, it can make the animal sick. Good dental hygiene is part of good health. Start them young and it's a breeze! Purchasing through Amazon was HALF PRICE from what the Veterinarian charges too!!"
1,Poor formatting,"Technically, this is Bellows's translation, but formatted poorly. Other editions actually put spaces in between the lines of poetry. And do a better job of separating the footnotes from the stanzas."
3,"Good movie, but some not relavent","This is a good movie for those curious about the life of a Russian bride, or those just starting their search. One bad misconception in the movie, is that she had obtained a fiance visa, without first meeting. That's not how this works in real life. You'll be making one or more trips over there. But, all in all, it did show what a young Russian bride may encounter."
3,2 People looking for love,"A workaholic from NY (Blake) decides it is time to have someone else in his life and turns to Russia in the hope of meeting the lady of his dreams. Tanya, a beautifull young Russian girl selects him as a mate from a number of hopefull others in similar positions.This is the story of their Blake and Tanya getting together in NY the problems they face and Blakes eventual disillusionment with Tanya leaving her in an impossible position.This is a heart wrenching story of looking for love, of hope of a better life, false expectations and the shattering of dreams."
5,Breathing Life into Music,"Wow!!! What a mind-blowing CD. The catchy beats and lyrics have me listening to this CD non-stop. I have waited a long time for a band like DownCycle to appear. Their following in Raleigh NC is massive and their fans are loyal. The voice of the lead singer Mike Bonavita combined with the guitars of BUk, Robby, bassist Todd P. and the drums of Barry make for a very interesting blend of music that everyone can listen to. For anyone who likes rock and enjoy listening to such bands as Staind, Tool ( A Perfect Circle), Fingereleven, etc. will enjoy this CD immensely. All in all I have enjoyed this CD and have bought many copies to give to my friends so that they may enjoy it as well. I have a feeling that DownCycle will be national soon and that they are here to stay so I encourage people to buy the CD and see what they think."
4,Breathe This disc,"I first listened to this disc in the car and it was ok, then I listened to it real loud in the headphones and it was great. Most of the music is really straight forward but is delivered very well and with a lot of emotion. A great first effort from an independent band, they will surely be making some great records in the future. I reccomend to give it a chance."
2,ULTRA is NO ULTRAMAGNETIC,"Sure KOOL KEITH actually is ULTRAMAGNETIC lyrically,but why short the group's name when he is the only member from it? TIM DOG? So what,he dissed Compton and was a guest on ULTRAMAGNETIC's 'FUNK YOUR HEAD UP' (about 4-5 tracks). There is nothing here for ULTRA,the title track is about the only clean track you can blast around your kids. Everything else,oh my God watch out. The guys are vexed to the limit,why? You listen yourself. Although TIM DOG featured KOOL KEITH on 'PENICILLIN ON WAX',this is their first of anything together. Even so this is a weak effort,I'd buy a second album by ULTRA and pray it'd be better than this."
1,general onan quality,"Onan advertises rv in their generators, but the quality is not there. They are strickly into marketing!! The motor generator is ok, but the accesories like mufflers, frames, starter motor, aqnd exhaust parts are made of cheap steel which rust like crazy. I have a 4 year old generator with 10 hrs on the unit. The starter had a bad spot in it. Removed generator, and the rust is sca;ing and the main pan is seriously rusted. RV should mean that some stainless should be used to take road salt and be better built than a basement storage type generator. I have a generac basement generator built alot better than this unit. If rplacing a generator, stay away from this overmarketed junk!...Tom"
4,Incredible Sophomore Album,"I bought the first album a while ago and loved almost every song. Especially the Boss Battle theme from FFVII (which to this day I still think is Nobuo's best song ever written) and was exciting to see he created a sequal album. I'm happy they put songs from IX which weren't in the first album (especially Vamo' Alla Flamenco), but am saddened that he didn't put any more of the awesome tracks from FFVII. The guitars are crunchy as hell and have incredible melody. My only beef with this album.. which was my only beef with the old album.. is the synth sound just gets so cheezy and annoying sometimes.. but it's easy to get over."
1,Nunca llegó! It never arrived!,"Unluckily you informed that you didn't have this item available, I had to buy to another supplier"
2,"OK MOVIE..... RENT DON""T BUY","I bought this not knowing what to expect. I got a fairly decent story. This movie is better suited for rental and not one I'd recommend buying. The sex, what little there is, is muted to the point of almost being nonexistant. It primarily revolves around an otherwise ordinary guy who starts fantasizing over a particular girl. The fantasies become an obsession on which he acts. This movie is not pleasant to watch by any means, but still the director managed to film it in a rather bland manner, in which everything is muted. Charlie S."
4,A lovely animal set,"My daughter loves this animal set and has spent hours with her cows, pig, sheep and dog. the dog is very ambiguous and looks like a dog/cat mix. Either way, she likes it. The sheep's woolly coat can be removed for the fresh-shorn look.After owning the set 18 months, one of the dog's legs broke. The peg holding it into the leg hole split and it fell out. I took a photo of it and emailed their customer care department, who quickly sent out a free replacement.I have been very happy with Plan Toys as a company, and the quality of their products."
4,So cute,"I bought these for my daughter as a Christmas present when she was 21 months old. They are very well made and very cute. I like that they are wood and cloth with non-toxic stains/paints and no plastic. Unfortunately, the mommy cow's head broke off after an enthusiastic throw by our daughter. I guess this is the risk when playing with a wooden toy on a hardwood floor! I do not think it has anything to do with the quality of the toy, just an aspect of wooden toys that is different from plastic. If you are looking to avoid the risks of plastic toys, this is a great alternative."
3,"Good artwork, but boring story","The artwork of X is as stunning as all other Clamp's manga, however, the story itself isn't that great, esp compared with many other good manga. Many scenes just keep showing up again and again in an unnecessary manner. If for artwork alone, I would have given it 5 stars, but the story only worth 1 star, IMHO."
4,Uhhh straight edge? I think not,"This band is badass, much better I think than the bands that came from their ashes(Shadows Fall and Killswitch Engage). However, despite what a previous reviewer said, these guys are definitely not straight edge as I have hung out with Brian Fair and Mike D'Antonio and they definitely enjoy their brew and bud."
5,*** BRUTAL METAL/HORROR CORE ***,"My title pretty much sums it up. One of the best bands to be ever created with members from greats by the likes of 'Shadows Fall' & 'Killswitch Engage'.Solid brutal hooks n breakbeats to counter the deep melodies produced endlesly throughout the whole album.I recommend to all fans of devilcore, KsE, Brian Fair vox, deathcore, metalcore and pure earf#cking music."
4,"Straight edge, Devilcore from the best",After first hearing Expectational Dilution i was blown away but i craved for something heavier and angrier and i found it in Fight ambition to kill. This album is so heavy it is the essence of Devilcore so if u like Earthcrisis u will love this.
5,"Straight forward, brutal, emotional metal.","The first time I saw Overcast was at a club by my house, and my friends band was opening for them. From the moment they came on stage, to the moment they left the agression and power never stopped. Since then I have fallen in love with their music, as well as this album. This is easily the most intelligently written, and tight metal album I have ever listened to. If you are into Starkweather, Slayer, Coalesce, or any other powerful metal bands, check these guys out, you will not be dissapointed!! (And they are just as tight live, but they recently broke up, sorry!!)"
4,Fans don't care,"The gloves have soft lining, which feels nice; since they're new, I don't know how long that will last, but it seems like it'll do ok. The exterior leather also seems like decent quality.These aren't for seriously cold weather; they've got slits for the velcro adjustments, and they just reach the wrist. Also, I wouldn't use them for handling rough stuff, since the leather is soft and supple rather than tough.But if you're a sports fan, the logo ont eh back of the hand is what mostly matters anyway, right? In my case (SF 49ers), the colors are right, though the embroidering of the red portion is a bit thin (you can see the black leather through it). This thinness actually looks ok in my case anyway.I like 'em."
4,This grows on you!!,"The rythms and underlying beat develop in a sophisticated way, and the enthusiasm of the artists is very apparent! Constant variations give real depth to the music and artistry."
5,Ideas to sleep on!,"Susie Johns has put together a beautiful book for anyone who has a yen to be creative. ""Pretty Pillows"" is packed with practical information. Each project has excellent step-by-step instructions and a colour photo to show you exactly what you are aiming for. The book covers many different techniques from cross-stitch to batik, patchwork to silk painting. Johns also encourages her readers to add their own touches in fabric and colour choice. A wealth of knowledge and ideas is contained in ""Pretty Pillows"". This makes it an ideal choice for the less experienced craftsperson. And a source of inspiration for the already competent."
4,"Very Good, but not what I thought","I do love the album, but the difference between the release track and the other track was only slight. Not so sure that I would've purchased it had I known that is was that little of a difference."
4,pleasant moodiness,"If you liked the Trance Planet CD series, you'll like this. Techno/electronica blends with acoustic basics - guitar, and piano. Good for a dark, rainy evening when you're burning incense and letting your mind wind into moody places."
3,Not as innovative as you'd like,"This album is good. It's good background music for a rainy day or a self-pitying night alone. That's about it. It doesn't break much ground, nor does it have the guts to really develop the songs past their initial ambient grooves, though some of the sampling is interesting. The brief, self-contained tracks make this a pop album for ambient fans, but whereas pop songs shouldn't overextend themselves, this album doesn't extend itself enough. It'll slide by you without much stick, and repeated listenings won't help it sink in, as much as you might wish it would. It's fine, that's all. Just fine."
2,Overall pretty boring,There is some interesting information included in this movie... but that's all it is! information! Very dry and un-entertaining. Save your money and read the Wikipedia article for Judaism.
3,JohnD,"For those who are not familiar with the Jewishness of Yeshua - the Hebrew name of Jesus, this film can start an open door that can help understand that Jesus/Yeshua a Jew followed the Jewish custom's and teachings of the First Century. This is an important fact that many Christians and any one who chooses to follow the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to start with to understand the deeper nature and mission of Jesus/Yeshua. Once this is done then one can go into more detail and study of the life of Jesus/Yeshua and gain a better understanding of many of His statements, teachings, and works."
5,Chet Baker Sings!!!,"Chet Baker is not the most talented singer in the world. He does get by doing it though. He's never off key, and has a good ear for pitch, but technically, he's not a great singer. But this is Chet Baker. Not a great singer, but his voice has warmth and it is unique.Chet is not a singer. He is a trumpet player, who happens to sing sometimes. Somebody probaly talked him into singing, maybe the record company.This album is a showcase for his voice. He goes through standards like But Not For Me, and Time After Time like he would if he was doing the melody with his horn. Then he compliments his warm singing voice with his warm trumpet tone.Chet Baker is a very unique musician. His looks, his singing, his trumpet playing, his fame, it looked like he had it all. Actually he had a very horrible life, in his later years.This is Chet Baker! Chet on the west coast, singing, blowing, and everything in between."
4,The high point in literature of the rails,"Let me start by saying that each of us responds reflexively to certain elements of the environment with a kind of passionate and largely involuntary embrace. Of course, it's different elements for each of us. For me, and I suppose for Harry Bedwell, trains are among those automatic triggers of interest. What distinguishes Bedwell's stories about trains and people is that he was the most able craftsman, the best storyteller, of the many ones I've read. So this book is a high point in the literature of the rails. It's an enjoyable book with, to my ear, some rather modern prose styling, along with the drama and the canonic tale telling."
5,The Boomer: A Story of the Rails,"This was a gift to a son who loves railroads. He says that it's a great book, and that anyone who's 'into' trains would like it."
5,Good railroading book,"There is more to railroading than riding the rails. Eddie Sand is one of the people who kept the railroads running during the Depression as a telegrapher. The position requires a skilled telegrapher, a person who is cool under pressure, and able to react instantly when necessary. The only problem I had with the story was one of the episodes ended in a rather fanciful way, but the rest were realistic. I enjoyed it, you will too if you like railroading."
5,He stole his ideas from Pythagorus' works in the Library of Alexandria,"Don't be fooled. He took his ideas from the Library of Alexandria which housed all the great works of Antiquity and then he burned them so that his ideas would flourish in Christ's name. The work is Pythagorus' folks. Sorry to disappoint you, he stole the ""copyrights"". And Cyril twisted it into Christian theology."
4,One of Pat Metheny's Best,"Over the years, Pat Metheny has released dozens of albums; I find that this one stands out, namely because the numbers on it are much more memorable. I particularly like ""The Red One"", track no 2, as well as ""No Way Jose"", but I pretty much like the cd through and through."
4,I almost overlooked this jewel !!,"Another solid collection of energetic jazz from Pat & SEVT (Somebody Else Very Talented). I don't intend to denigrate JS, because I don't know his music. I just know that when Pat gets together with another whiz for a studio recording session, the results are usually great. This CD has a lot of similarities to other CDs that Pat's done with SEVT, but the flavor of this one is more electric, upbeat, and dynamic than others.I believe that I own every release that Pat's ever done with anyone else, solo, or PMG. I even have the one with Joni Mitchell. It's the fattest and most cherished part of my music collection! This CD is a solid addition. I can't believe that I just discovered it this year. It's been out since 1994."
3,sound good; looks ugly,"i'm not an audiophile, but these sound good to me. the only complaint would be the length of the cord (way too long) and the ear buds are connected in a J-shape. that means one side is longer than the other. if u don't mind (i thought i didn't, but eventually did), then i guess it would be ok."
4,Great for the price!,"I bought these headphones after my ears got sore from the white headphones that Creative includes with their mp3 players (which seem abnormally large). These are comfortable, don't fall out and have great sound."
2,"Comfortable, Yes, but poor fidelity and lousy bass.","Being new to the MP3 world the earbuds that came with our Zen Nano units are our benchmark. We think they are pretty good reproducing our music but they are just a little big for comfort.The improvement in comfort of these JVC buds is not worth the trade off in sound the quality of the original Zen buds.For example the bass line and harmonica riffs are almost non existant in Waylon Jennings music. Not good.They are not as efficient either, the volume level needs to be boosted much, much higher than with the Zen buds.We will send them back."
3,great deal for the price,great deal for the price.I've only had the watch for about 4 months so it's to soon to tell if the color on the watch its self starts to fade.
3,I'm Being Generous with Three Stars,"I guess the main reason this book was written was to provide a more balanced account of Billy Martin. He certainly had a number of people who didn't care for him and a number of derogatory stories have been told about him. This book relates experiences about people such as Willie Horton, Paul Blair, Rod Carew, Mike Heath, and others who had positive experiences regarding Billy Martin. Any manager has individuals who can tell both positive or negative stories about them so Martin would not be unique in this respect. I find Billy Martin to be an interesting individual to read about in baseball, but I found the book to have pretty much the same people commenting on him throughout. It is not a story of his life, but one that is told by those having positive experiences with him. I buy baseball books to save for my baseball library, but if I had the chance to do it again, this book would have remained in the bookstore. I found it to be repetitious and boring at times."
3,a good novel,"I enjoyed reading this book. But calling it a masterpiece and giving it 5 stars seem to me exagerated for such a novel. I would not consider The Human Factor as a novel that one must read. There are thousands of other books where the story, the characters, the style are more powerful and more exciting."
2,Disappointing,"For what it is, and when it was written, this is not a bad book at all. However, I think by today's standards it's a bit of a let down. Personally, I was looking for something more like Forsyth, with action and plot twists as well as details about the intelligence world, and was disappointed."
1,The commie good guys,"It is a shame that great writers like Greene just can't seem to give up on their Marxist sympathies. The main character in this book resist actually becoming a communist, but by the end of this book Greene removes any doubt that he is one of the unfortunate, naive leftist writers who was still holding out hope for the communists to get it right. Greene knew about the horrors of communism but in this book the good guys are all Soviets and, of course, the bad guys are all those callous, racists, greedy capitalists. Perhaps he never learned what an unbelievable racist Marx (not to mention Lenin and Stalin)actually was? I picked this book up at a used book store because I had read so many other spy writers compared to Greene. To ensure no one else will make the same mistake I did, I am throwing it away."
4,Dated but timeless,"This is one of Graham Greene's later books, and though some of the elements now seem dated (apartheid, the Cold War), the essence of the story is timeless because it concerns human foibles and emotions. Other reviewers have commented on the ""anti-hero"" spy--which was perfected by John Le Carre in the character of George Smiley, but Greene's Castle surely comes close (and may even be ""better""). I first read this book in the late 1970s/early 1980s, and in rediscovering it recently, was struck by the timelessness of the story. The main characters are wonderfully fleshed out and the sheer amateurishness of the British security service is at once charming and appalling. A wonderful read to (re)discover."
3,"good concept, poor terms & conditions","This phone designed for the tween set is good in theory, but the company's terms & conditions, which are not clearly spelled out anywhere obvious, get you to keep dumping money into it, even if you're not using the minutes. I had activated my phone over the summer, but never used it. When I went to give it to my daughter to take somewhere, I was puzzled when I tested it and was told that was not a valid phone number. Apparently, once the minutes are activated, you have 90 days to either use them or buy more, after which the minutes expire. To reactiviate, you have to purchase a new SIMS card at $25! This was supposed to be mostly for emergency use, I certainly don't need more minutes every 90 days. I plan to wait until my kids are older and will see more use out of it."
1,Dont waste your money,"This item is a great concept, BUT, First of all you have no idea how many minutes are on your phone unless you go online to find out. The phone does not hold a charge long enough to last the day. Your child cannot text you back because the phone hasn't the capability, providing they can even receive them on this thing with all of it's need for tech. support.....I ended up getting my child a trac phone, cost less and worked much better. Do not waste your money on this thing."
1,POOR POOR Customer Service!!! Don't Buy!!,"We bought this phone for our 7 year old daughter who has a vision impairment. We thought the buttons were big enough and the phone would be easy to use. Trying to refill minutes, getting a new sim card and using their worthless internet site has been a nightmare!! Shop elsewhere!"
3,I Want To Like This Disc,"As an aficionado of both African music and dance remixes, I had high hopes for ""Frikyiwa,"" but after several listenings I feel like I want more. More diversity in styles (in terms of both African sources and dance genres), more radical reconstruction, and personally more junglism. As it is, ""Frikyiwa"" contains only middling performances--and those in small bites--and mediocre, mainly Euro-style beats, plus two dub tracks that while good dub have only tiny bits of African sounds. While this disc should (and has) gotten credit for being an attempt to concentrate on African/dance fusions, I am looking more forward to what will progress out of this than with ""Frikyiwa"" itself."
2,tantalizing idea poorly executed,"As a great fan of Afropop in general, and of the overall Six Degrees-type approach to things, this one looked like a no-brainer. Like the other reviewer, though, I came away disappointed. There is certainly enough African material for Six Degrees-type remixes to last until the next century, and I think such projects are potentially very worthwhile, but the source material used here doesn't seem all that strong. Of course, it's kind of hard to tell because a thick gauze of electronic mush is draped over the whole proceedings. I don't hear anything innovative or inspired here, which is a real shame because the concept has such fantastic and varied possibilities. This one strikes out, but I hope Six Degrees pursues it in the future with the same vigor they've given South American treatments, for example."
1,Major Firmware update bug (Do not buy),"(See other reviews on the internet for this product also, all complaining of the same problem).Plug it in, unit will ask if you want to upgrade firmware (default is yes). Press Yes, and the unit will stop working permanently.DO NOT BUY until manufacturer fixes this Major Bug. I selected this unit over the Roku, because I liked the ability to add a hard disk. The features in this unit are excellent, BUT it will automatically try to upgrade its firmware over the network, and this WILL RENDER THIS UNIT USELESS. You will not be able to reset or do anything with this unit except send it back. I tried 2 units, and had the same issue with both. Spoke with ""product specialists"" at DLink. They should simply take these units off the market instead of wasting the consumer's time and effort.Search for 'dsm-120 firmware' on Google for other similar reviews of this unit."
4,It does what it is supposed to do.,The firmware update fix is out there.The product is simple and does what it is expected to do: streams music from your PC to another location in your home wirelessly.
2,Bring Back Chet Baker,"No trace here of Chet Baker, the gifted trumpet soloist, much less Chet Baker, the innovator (with Gerry Mulligan) of the West Coast sound. ""Chet Baker for Lovers."" Contrast his trumpet performance on My Funny Valentine here with his earlier lyrical and inventive performance with Gerry Mulligan. If you really liked Johnny Mathis, you might like this. Obviously, some reviewers did. To me it sounds completely derivative."
3,Chet Sings,I was somewhat surprised to realize it was Chet singing. His voice isn't great but it has a lot of feeling; kinda in the French style. There is some classic Chet trumpet playing as well. I enjoy it in quite times.
1,Chet Baker - My funny valentine,Not as expected.Expected brilliant saxo solos but was just singing with a really boring and sleeping voice
4,A wonderful showcase of Baker's original talents,"Chet Baker's voice had an innocent, sincere quality that few other singers have matched (although they've certainly tried). These 14 cuts -- mostly standards -- are not only well performed but also well recorded, with a warm sonic clarity.This CD is a good start in building a Chet Baker collection; if you want only one Baker disc, this will fill the bill."
5,Excellent,"These are works by a young Chet Baker, simple, most of them without a string section, just trumpet, piano, drums, and bass fiddle, and singing between the trumpet solos. These songs are very pure and effective having somewhat the same effect on me as James Taylor's ""Sweet Baby James"". Fortunately, CD's don't wear out from frequent playing."
4,Half Of The CD Are Fillers,"Unless you don't mind paying multiple times for the same track, keep on reading.These are all truly great numbers but from a total of 14 songs, 7 have been published in ""Embraceable You"" and ""Best Of Chet Baker Sings"". I would not object if they were different interpretations but these are exactly the same recordings."
5,Incredible!,This CD is the closest to perfection that one can buy. This one goes in my all time top five. The music is very well mastered for being from the 50s. And Chet is utterly perfect.This CD is a must have for any adult's collection.
4,a respectable sophomore effort,"I'd actually give this 3 stars, but such a rating is not possible.Most fans of Pee's debut ""Now, More Charm and More Tender"" probably won't be disappointed with this CD. There are significantly fewer songs, but the songwriting prowess is still there. The problem is that you can have excellent songwriting and still end up with some mediocre songs. There are some truly awesome tunes here, notably ""I Can't Wait 'Til I Get Rickets"", ""The Rewards of Gourmet Cooking"", ""The Misguided Self-Punishers"", and ""Carmen's Theme"". That's nearly half of the album. However, when pretty much 100% of the debut CD is great and only 50% of the follow-up is, there's inevitably some letdown, however small it may be.Fans of the first CD will also note that track 66 from that one is in finished form for this CD and is aptly entitled ""Track Sixty-Six""."
1,misleading,this product was not the right one... now they have a picture of the dvd but before it was very misleading as to what this item truly was
1,JW from South Carolina,buy beware of this seller!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!false reps movie. Not Disney move!!!!!Uses Disney cover to sell cheap aftermarket!!!
1,Misleading,It was advertised as being the Disney Movie and turned out to be a off production from another production company all together. Very disappointed to say the least as it was a gift for my 2 little nieces and they love Beauty and the Beast. They are not mad about it but I am. It was very embarassing for my wife and me to get a call telling us that the movie arrived and it was a knock off. I will never buy a movie from this seller again.
1,If there is less than 1-star in the rating this will be it. Do not be deceived by the title and the picture as I did.,If there is less than 1-star or a negative star this is it. Do not be deceived by the picture and title- this is not the Disney Beuty and the Beast.
3,NOT DISNEY!,"TRUE THIS IS NOT THE DISNEY VERSION. AND THERE ARE PARTS WHERE ANIMATION HAS BEEN REPEATED, BUT ITS STILL A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE."
4,A wonderful collection of medical memories...,"I picked up this book because of my enjoyment of Thomas' earlier books, Lives of a Cell, and Medusa and the Snail. This happened about 20 years ago.I've read The Youngest Science: Notes of a Medicine-Watcher two times since then.The Youngest Science focuses not on specific ""adventures"" within medicine, microbiology, and evolution, but more on the evolution of Dr. Thomas himself, from watching his father (a physician), to going through medical school, to becoming a medical researcher, to reaching the positions of authority within various colleges of medicine.Thomas was in the early part of his career when there came about profound changes in the understanding and treatment of disease processes. This makes his observations particularly interesting.The book suffers from being so far behind the times in terms of modern medicine. Nevertheless, as the historical documentation of the evolution of a medical career, it remains fascinating."
1,A waste of time.,It is too bad that some trees had to give their lives so this book could be published.
4,Joe Is Really Good!!!,Their isn't a bad song on this CD. Joe is really good!!! He remains virtually unknown except to those who listen to this genre of music. He reminds me of George Duke with good vocals and great playing. I can't understand why he isn't more popular??? I own 2 of his CD's and plan to buy more. This is a good starting place for those who haven't heard him. Thanks Joe!!!
3,60's TV at its best?,"I remember watching Petticoat Junction as a kid and thinking it was pretty good, so when I saw that it was coming out on DVD I bought it right away. Does the show hold up after 40 odd years? Somewhat, the first few shows focus mostly on the railroad trying to shut down the Cannonball and thus putting the hotel out of business. While the show does have some down home charm, Edgar Buchannan was doing his best Barney Fife/second bananna imatation and was pretty much wasted in the role. One thing to consider, this was the age of a lot of shows in a season, this set has 36-ish episodes, and after about 3 you will be looking for something else to watch for a while. Best in small doses. There are bonus' included featuring interviews with the first Bobby Jo and Billie Jo who also do introductions to most episodes."
3,TV land is a nightmare,"If paramount is compiling these DVDs from TV land edited versions, do not waste your money. Their editing is ridiculous, often cutting the best scenes from classic favorites. All for a few more advertising dollars. It should be illeal."
4,"Deserves this release, but this IS CBS we're talking about...","I am happy that the show is getting official releases, though the MPI set was very good. It really deserves the treatment. But I am worried when you consider who will be releasing it...yes, CBS/Paramount, known for: edited episodes; changing any music that costs, well, anything; and logo plastering (I am hopeful as they usually plaster Paramount logos, and there are officially none on PJ)"
4,Great Memories - Cute Show,"I've really enjoyed this DVD. Great quality for an old black & white show. Content-wise, if you enjoy the old-style comedies of the '60's, I think this show ranks right up there. We've gotten lots of viewing enjoyment out of this, and look forward to future releases of other seasons."
5,Just What I Wanted,"This is a concise, beautifully illustrated Bead book. I was looking for something different than the usual French Beaded flower instruction. In my opinion, the instructions are relatively easy to follow, IF you already have been introduced to basic bead weaving stitches. It even contains a pretty good section on how to do these basic stitches. There are instructions on many flowers, and even variations on some. All in all, a lovely and useful book."
5,One of the best & most beautiful beading books I own!,"We love every single design in this book, and the author, Diane Fitzgerald, has outdone herself this time! Flower bouquets, flower necklaces, flower brooches... flowers, flowers, and more flowers! Simple, clear diagrams with easy to read instructions... combined in the most exquisite and unique ways. What more can you ask for?I own two copies since mine are always being ""borrowed,"" but I'm happy to have more."
5,The Beaded Garden : Creating Flowers with Beads and Thread,This book is just fantastic.The patterns of all the florals and insects are just beautiful;but most of all her instructions are clear and easy to understand.Love the book.Kasey Toledo Mazzara
3,Beautiful pictures but sadly lacking in visual directions,"I am a seasoned beader and wire worker but have only in the last few months branched off into the wonderful and adictive world of seed beads, but this book just does not have the proper amount of visual instructions even for my newness to the craft. I find my self thumbing through the pages wistfully wanting to do some of the very interesting projects with in, but sadly I have not as yet been able to put one of the projects into use. I esspecialy would like to make the tiny versions of daffodils...someday after a few more classes I hope. If you are a non visual learner and can pick it up from written instruction this book would be great for you."
2,Some projects have poor directions,"This is a very attractive book with lots of information about forming flowers, leaves and stems. However, I have had several problems with inaccuracy with directions. Point: I have made 7 roses per directions in the book. NONE have come out the way they look in the book. I followed the given directions and the rose was too tight...as were all the others I made. I tried not gathering to tight - same result. I tried skipping some of the contact beads and that got tricky and still didn't get the look in the book. Now, I am simply experimenting with my own ideas and see how that works. But, what a lot of wasted time, thread and beads trying to get it right!"
4,point,"This album was very different compared to the last two,hop were probably one of the most aggressive groups in hip hop.But this album was calm the main reason being that eric shcrody aka everlast , lead mc had a heart attack. Thats probably the reason that this was toned down a bit , but still a good album. The first album was the most moody which was great, the second being aggressively good."
2,Um...Where's the House of Pain I know and love?,"Upon listening to this, I asked myself...""What the F?"" I didn't hear the old-school style and feel of their previous albums, I heard ""We're trying to sound like the rest of the West Coast"". Disappointing at best..."
5,U***N***D***E***R***R***A***T***E***D,"""HOUSE OF PAINS"" 3rd installment to the H.O.P trilogy ""RISE AGAIN"" is probably one of the most underrated hip-hop albums of all time & its there very hardest! the thing about H.O.P.'s 3 albums is that they are all a little different from eachother & at the same time there all just as good as eachother! all 3 albums are just str8 up 5 star masterpiece's of the hip-hop culture/genre!!!! its kinda funny in a way with the full title of there last album being ""TRUTH CRUSHED TO EARTH SHALL RISE AGAIN"" because the crushed truth did rise up again when the legendary EVERLAST bursted back in the music world as a much wiser & elder philosipher with his solo act, just proof that real skill = longevity!!!!!!!! HOUSE OF PAIN is one of the greatest rap bands eva so you'd betta !RECONIZE!"
5,tip-top hip-hop album,"This may be one of the best hip hop albums ever. No, it does not sound like the first or second albums. It is much much better. This is one of the few discs you can listen to from beginning to end without skipping any tracks. If you understand Hip-hop the way it was meant to be heard, not like the material of Puff-Daddy, or Will Smith, you'll want this. It blends melody, beats and lyrics in a way that will surprise you"
1,A waste of money - do not buy!,"Having taken ballet classes for eight years, I was not at all impressed by this DVD. The production quality is poor, there is very little barre work and the instruction is brief. Much of the DVD is in fact movements which aren't related to ballet. I attempted to follow this DVD one time and gave up - the instructor is awful. Save your money and don't buy this."
5,Excellent Ballet Video!,This is the absolute nearest I have come to finding a real ballet class on video. It has a wonderful warm up followed by floor exercises and center work. If you are studying Ballet this is great at home practice refresher. If you are taking a Ballet class and thinking of buying one tape or dvd buy Ballet Bootcamp 2!
4,"Standard ""Pieces"" fare with Eva Cassidy added","Basically if you like ""Pieces of a Dream"" you will enjoy this album. What makes this one stand out as unusual in their discography is the addition of the late, great singer Eva Cassidy, who sings lead in the title song and another called ""Have a Little Faith."" If you're a big Cassidy fan, get her other albums first, including ""The Other Side"" with Chuck Brown."
4,Forgotten wonder,"I note there are only two for sale, neither of which have the records--text only! If Columbia had one half the brains of Rush Limbaugh, they would put out a CD. This (I own it) is terrific--I was looking to see if I could find a copy for one of my fellow historians. American companies just have no common sense compared to the Europeans. Hell, maybe the Japanese can put out a copy for $300--it would still be a steal. Many of the classic Americana singers, and the great songs of our past, what a wonderful symbol of the high point of American civilization the middle of the 20th century."
3,Mostly plastic and flimsy,"From the pics, my wife and I thought it was metal. Nope, all plastic. Would rather it been made of metal to make it more rigid and durable. Seems to be working just fine though."
2,SPICE RACK,"I like the idea of a spinning spice rack because it is unique and it saves space. However, this one looks like it is metal, but as soon as you open it you can tell that it is plastic with a shiny ""sticker"" like finish. In addition, it didn't even have some of the basic spices like garlic powder. Nice idea, but poorly built. I just hope mine will last."
3,Damaged product,"Receipt the product in bad conditions, stiff evil, rompio or flask of species and descuadro the base of the carrousel, that disappointment since it was a high price for the bad quality of the product"
3,Rack,"The Spice rack itself is sturdy, but all of the names have peeled off the containers, and it is a hassle to not know what spices are in the jars without constantly looking."
5,Wonderful and unique spice rack at a great price,We love this. We have seen this item for twice the amount at local stores. It was a great price and came with all the spices. What a great find.
1,Horrible,"One of the jars was broken in the box so I had to go buy extra jar at bed bath and beyond. It is cheaply made and not stable. It looks fancy but every time I use it, I just hope it wont break down."
3,SPICE RACK REVIEW,I FIND THIS SPICE RACK TO BE CONVENIENT TO USE AND LOOKS NICE ON MY COUNTERTOP. I ALSO LIKE THE CONVENIENCE OF HAVING A SPICE AT A GLANCE.
1,dissappointed,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, it is a great show and the desciption clearly says this is an all regions dvd however this does not play on australian dvds."
5,More Than Anyone Asked For...,"After the wait, people expected alot from this second album. Resident Hero surpassed all expectations. With tantalizing vocals, wonderful guitar and superb drums, this album is a non-stop rollercoaster. Perhaps the biggest thrill is listening to the perfectly written lyrics. Buy this cd, but do not let anyone borrow it-- you will never get it back."
1,This cd stinks.,"I want my money back. This cd shold carry the warning ""May hurt ears and pocketbook"" in my opinion. All the songs sound the same. I've seen these guys live, and the only word that comes to mind is ""blows."" Go to an Uncle Silas concert, or better yet, a movie."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"We purchased this bouncer because of its bright colors and overhead mobile. We have been very disappointed. It runs batteries out VERY quickly, and the bouncer itself is really, really big. Also, the side arm toys are a good idea in theory, but my son does nothing but pull them off and throw them on the floor. There should be an attached plaything on the side arms to keep them entertained for longer periods of time. Overall, it needs some improvement in several areas. I would not recommend this bouncer to a friend. Maybe an enemy. ;)"
2,Not my favorite,"This bouncy seat is obviously comfortable for napping, and lays back more than my other one. I give it 2 stars because he sleeps well in it (hates his crib so far and only in pack n play the first part of the night). BUT the mobile seems too high to get his attention. He likes to look forward and see things. The mobile may turn, but there is nothing on it but little plastic pieces that don't do a THING. This thing does NOT entertain my son at all. I bought the fisher price flutterbye seat for half the price and he LOVES it."
2,Very colorful bouncer,"But thats all. I hate to return this bouncer its so pretty! I am not happy with the mobile its too far above head for my baby to even know its there. The two side rattles are hard plastic not soft, and when my baby gets excited and kicks her feet, her knees bump the rattle holders and they are not soft either."
5,after trying differet bouncers she loves this!,SOur daughter frist had the lullaby dreams she hated it!So we got her this bouncer shes 2 months old tomorrew we putted her in it right away and she loved it!she laughed and giggled she loves watching her baby enstien videos in it.
3,"Pretty good, but there is better","The downfalls of this bouncer is the toys come out of the holder very easily so in a flash your child will have them and throw them accross the room, onto the floor than cries wanting his toys back... Another downfall is the rotating mirror is right above and a bit behind their head, which makes them stretch their necks to look at it. And the last downfall is that you can not connect any new toys to dangle down and change the ""atmosphere"" at all. I like changing it up a bit to keep his attention while I do the dishes, clean, etc. There are several features that I like, but all in all, all of these could be found in other bouncers with additional functional features. If I could, I would go back and purchase another bouncer like the jungle one. :)"
2,Disappointed....Music Didn't work,"I liked this bouncer because of all the colorful activity and sounds, but after putting it together and adding batteries, the music doesn't work, only the vibration and mobile. That is disappointing. Fisher Price is not reliable. With my first child, I had to take 2 aquarium swings back before getting one that all the functions worked on it. Lesson learned, test before completely assembling. It's a pain to get it all back in the box and have to return it."
2,Does not last long. We bought two.,We bought two of these for our twin sons back in Feb 2006. They love sleeping in them and kicking in them. The babies love the music on the mirror on top. We liked that it allowed them to lay flat instead of bunching up in the other swings. We thought you got a lot for the money. We loved that it had the vibration and the mobile but in less than two months one of the mobiles on the bouncer broke and the other one makes a loud sound. I contacted Fisher Price to see if there was something we could do they were not very helpful they told us to take it back to the store (we got rid of the boxes) or to take the base and one wire leg and pay to ship it back and wait six weeks to get a replacement. We were upset that the item did not last longer and that the company is giving us a hard time about returning the item
4,Fantastic!,"This was a gift at my baby shower and turned out to be the biggest life-saver of all. It's all my son would sleep in the first week of his life; all he would nap in for nearly two months! My only complaints: the ""vibrations"" are a bit noisy; you have to be SUPER gentle with the ""mirror dome""- we slung it back one too many times and the 'rotating' feature stopped working; it sucks batteries like crazy (though, in the big scheme of things, it's totally worth it!). My son (now 9 months) is too big for the bouncer, but still loves the bear/bee rattle toys. Also, it's so easy to toss the cover in the washer, then let air dry. Loved it and now buy it for all of my expecting mommy friends!"
3,Not the same as it once was...,"My mother-in-law, who watches my daughter, bought a sensory bouncer to keep at her house. I was excited to get one for our home because of the sensory options she would have. She especially liked the crinkly fabric on the bee's wings and on the swing arms that hold the bee and the bear. When I received the bouncer, many of the fabric items had been changed, and not in a good way. The same crinkly fabric wasn't used, and I found out after speaking with FP, is no longer used. To me, the ""sensory"" was taken out of the bouncer. There is still different fabric, but it's really not the same as the product they once put out (like the one my mother-in-law bought at a children's consignment shop.) My daughter still uses it, but doesn't show as much interest in the non-crinkly winged bee."
5,Perfect for Rest or Play,"My preemie son loves this bouncer seat! The toys are colorful and stimulating, the overhead mirror provides lots of entertainment for little ones. The music is soothing enough for when he falls asleep, but also upbeat and the volume can be turned up if you choose. The vibrations are also quieting and calming without being harsh and causing him to spit up like some swings do.I highly recommend this bouncer seat. It is also reasonably priced. A worthwhile product that will keep your baby happy when you need a break!"
5,Love this bouncer!,"We got this bouncer for our second child as it just had so much more to do/see then our previous one. Our daughter loves it! At only a couple of months she was already pulling on the toys and mesmerized by seeing herself in the mirror. The toys are great as there are so many different colors and textures to explore, and I love that we can not only adjust the sound level, but easily turn the speakers off entirely."
2,Too busy,"My baby thought this was a bit too much stimulation. She was 3 months old when we tried it. First, the two side holders could not fold out without squishing her in. (And she is small for her age) The mobile was neat. For some reason, the removable bee made her cry on instant. The seat seemed small and like she would grow out of it quickly. However, the fabric is soft. The speakers were a neat unique feature. Overall, she never grew to like it and we returned it. We ended up purchasing the Leap Frog Learning Seat which is really neat and has age appropriate stimulation."
4,"GREAT bouncer, BUT...........","My daughter really likes her bouncer, but after only about 2 weeks, it started making a loud humming noise everytime I turn on the vibration. I thought maybe it was the surface I had it on, but it doesn't matter, carpet or floor, it hums. Then, I tried squeezing together the battery box. The noise stops if I hold it tightly so I thought maybe the vibration loosened the screws. I tightened them, but it STILL makes that annoying humming noise. I really don't know what else to do. She loves the vibration and it puts her to sleep and even makes her less gassy, but we can't stand that loud noise! Besides that, everything else is great! I love the colors of the fabric and the toys. My daughter is 2 months and is now talking to herself in the mirror."
4,Good,"The bouncer does everything that the ad said that it would. It's nice and colorful and handy to have around. My son lays in it and watches me in the kitchen. The vibrations are really nice if he's in a good mood. And I can bounce him in it to soothe him to sleep. He also likes the rattles. But, too much time in it for our 3 month old gets him [...]. The buttons on the bouncer are not as clear as they could be. I keep having to refer to the instructions to figure out which combination of buttons does what. I also wish that the ad would have given a size/age estimate. I wish I had bought it sooner since my 3 month-17lb. baby will be out-growing it very soon."
2,It's Okay,"I had read a lot of good reviews of this product which is why we bought it. Our baby has used it for 3 or so months now and it doesn't hold her interest for very long. When she was younger, 3 months, she didn't like it at all. Now that she is older, 6 months, the hard toys she just chucks on the floor. I wish it had more toys, maybe softer ones since when she was little she kept hitting herself with them and wasn't that interested in them. Disappointed since she likes a lot of the other fisher-price products."
5,the best!,"We bought and tried three different bouncers before this one and they were all flops. Our son LOVED this one and it was worth the little bit of extra money to have something he can enjoy w/o being held. He is eight weeks old and we got it when he was 5 weeks old. He loved it then, loves it now, and will likely continue to enjoy it! kudos to FP!"
4,My daughter loves it,"This bouncer keeps my 3 month old entertained while I clean and do mommy things. She loves it, the fabirc is colorful, seems very comfy, she loves watching herself in the mirror. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the batteries dont seem to last long but other than that love it."
5,PERFECT,"This bouncer is perfect for my three month old. I tried three others, but this one beat them all by far. Not only does my daughter look absolutely comfortable, but she stays completely entertained as well. The other wonderful thing is that the bouncer is really cute so it isn't so hard to look at day after day in the middle of the living room floor. Also, all the toys on the bouncer fold out of the way so you can get baby in and out very easily."
2,Got a Lemon,"I'm sure this happens sometimes, but this shower gift was a disappointment. The music never worked, and the vibrations seem to have a short and work infrequently. The bouncer, however, is quality. Unfortunately, the nature of its construction limits its ease of portability. This toy does not collapse."
5,Great entertaining Fisher Price Sensory Selections bouncer,"My grandaughter used this for almost 8 months. She loved the mobil on the top and that she could see herself in the mirror. I read reviews that the toys on the sides interferred with the baby's thighs. My grandaughter had pretty chunky thighs and the toys were never a problem. She liked pulling the toys off to play with them. The music was plenty loud but not too loud that is would annoy anyone. Also she liked the vibrator, but you have to remember to shut it off (we often forgor) if you want to conserve the battery life. I would highly recommend this bouncer."
5,AWESOME,"I love this bouncer! The best is that you can select the level of stimulation for the baby. When my son starts to get stressed from too much playing, I can turn off the music, or vibration, or swivel back the mirror/mobile and/or the toys so he can go to sleep without moving him to another place. All of the options enable bay to play and sleep in this item - other bouncers don't allow for under/over stimulation.Love that the pieces are interchangeable with our 3 in 1 gym and other miracles and milestones toys with the same round base... he loves the toys."
1,load of sh..,"this thing is one piece of sh..! It is frosty cant make out a thing.Besides that, this upside down view you get when you look thru the viewfinder is utter nonsence.Because looking at anything thru a peephole in itself requires some effort in first trying to figure out quickly what yu are looking at ,far more difficult to accomplish this when wat U are lookin at is UPSIDE DOWN! Wen U tink of it HOW STUPID!"
2,Nothing New Here,"I can't really recall why I bought this pair of warhorses from Amazon . . . it seemed a good idea at the time, perhaps? As a budding classical music fan in the early 1960s, I remember listening to the Tchaikovsky 1812 with reverence and awe; the Beethoven piece I found much later, paired with the Tchaikovsky chesnut on a Philadelphia Orchestra LP. Both are dramatic, a workout for your stereo, but there's nothing new here, in either recording. But anyone who buys this disc surely does not want or expect anything new . . . no doubt my yawn is occasioned by the simple fact that I've heard this music far too many times to find anything exciting in it now that I'm no longer that adolescent boy discovering classical standards. I wish I could recapture the thrill of such new discoveries, but alas, it rarely happens now that I'm 61. These are competent recordings, but to me it is just ""same old, same old."""
5,Norton Password Manager 2004,I recently purchased the cd-rom of Norton Password Manager 2004And it does exactly what is says it will do!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Make sure to try this before buying it!!!,"FREE TRIAL: First of all, let me say there is a free 15-Day trial of this program on Symantec's website...try it before you buy it.On to the review: This isn't worth it. You have very little control over your passwords once you enter them into the program. After entry, you will never see your actual password again...good luck remembering them to use on a different computer. Ignoring the bad features and annoyances...this program didn't work on 3 out of the 7 websites I tried it on! That's nearly half! Stay Away!"
1,Just terrible,"I would expect products by Symantec to be of higher quality. This one is just terrible. There is no way to add new passwords manually, and it doesn't detect alot of login sites."
2,No longer supported,"I have to say that I have loved this product when I initially purchased it as part of a package in 2004. BUT - it just recently crashed and I was told by Symantec (after much time on the website & on hold on the phone) that they are no longer supporting this software! Since I have been a ""good"" computer user and backed up all my info I was assuming there should be some way to get back this information - WRONG. The only thing they said I could do was try to reinstall the program, but since I initially purchased it as a download only, I no longer was able to do that...I am EXTREMELY frustrated with the lack of support & concern for my dilemma and it has turned me very sour towards Symantec..."
1,FORGET ABOUT THIS ONE,Rarely ever works...have tried everything Norton has on their site to get it working again but nothing works...and impossible to contact them by email.Save your money.
2,Needs major enhancements before it is useable.,"After waiting forever for this product to actually be released, I am severely disappointed after having it for 24 hours. First, it can only be installed on one computer so you have to buy additional copies for your home and work computer. Second, once it starts remembering your passwords it is great about automatically filling them in for you at web sites and programs, however you can never see your passwords in the clear again. Since the program remembers them for you, it won't be long before you forget all your passwords, without retrieval. Since you can't see them in the clear, they are lost to the internal encryption within the program. It desperately needs a way to see all your passwords in the clear if you so choose!"
1,Doesn't do the job,"There are no provisions to backup your passwords, nor provisions to randomly generate passwords. How can I move my passwords from a desktop to a laptop? This software does not allow you to control where the data is saved. This software assums that you have some other master list of passwords in case this data is lost. I can't believe Norton put their name on this product."
1,Irish Stew,"Slow and BORING! Sorry I bought it. The purchase price of ""free"" would have been too expensive."
4,Good Read,I have read all the books in this series. The conversations between Dermot and his mental alter ego were very confusing at times. I would re-read paragraphs to make sure I was getting the speaker right. I enjoyed the history lesson though!
4,Item as promised,VERY fast delivery. The book is of decent quality and intact. I would most definitely buy from this seller again.
3,Renaissance & Roll,"I must admit I bypassed many of the poems that were lyrics (or lyrics that were poems, depending on your point of view) to find the soul behind Paul McCartney's foray into the poetry realm. I was pleasantly surprised that the poems that were poems (or poems that were poems...) were quite good and ingenius. Of notable import are ""Ivan"", ""Jerk of all Jerks"", and the clutch of poems about his wife Linda. The overabundance of lyrics - ""Monkberry Moon Delight""? - make it appear as though Macca simply didn't have the material to fill a book (which is consistant, as most fans think a lot of his albums come with plenty of filler). But then if one were to take the lyrics out, it would be a slim volume indeed. Kudos to the designers of the book, who went all out in terms of presentation."
1,Way overrated,I bought this book because of the high ratings (and corresponding low ratings of Sommerville's and Pressman's Software Engineering texts). I have to say that I was highly disappointed with this book. Just get Sommerville's or Pressman's textbook and skip this sub-par outline. I have Pressman's textbook and you can learn far more about software engineering from skimming that one than from reading this one.
4,Awesome,"This book is sort of a biography on Ozzy. It's great because it shows only what Ozzy, himself, said(it also has pices of what the members of Black Sabbath had to say). Its pieced together very well and is excellent for any Ozzy fan. Plus the price is right."
2,Only quote from him,"there are a lot of quotes from ozzy, for me it means nothing for who want to read about his biography."
3,Not bad,If you ever went to the cool clubs in the day then you heard most of these especailly Track 5
2,only the first three or four songs are good,"This Freestyle CD was not as great as the other ones because it contains a lot of songs that I never heard before (Time Passes By),etc."
1,Opionated Not Factual,"I read and enjoyed all six books of the Left Behind Series,even though I detected a lot of ""Catholic Bashing"" from the beginning. This seems to be his whole purpose of writing ""Revalation Unveiled"". I was disappointed with all the inaccuracies that I now wonder how many inaccuracies are in The Left Behind series. He really let his imagination run wild with all that vestal virgin and pagan mumbo jumbo as he relates it to the Catholic Church. Come on Tim, this is the 21st Century. Catholics have bible studies and read scriptures at mass from the same bible that you read from. We worship only one God and beleive in the the second coming of Christ. We beleive that we are no better or no worse than any other true beleiver in the word of God."
1,I'll toss it in the trash.,"I would rate this book no stars but that is not an option. I read what Lahaye had to say about the letters to the churches and already Lahaye had bashed NATO, the World Council of Churches, the Roman Catholics, anyone who babtizes infants, anyone who baptizes by sprinkling, anything ecumenical and women. I've got better things to do than read the rest. I'm sorry I wasted my money buying this book."
4,Revelation Unveiled,It was very helpful in my study of the book of Revelations.It really helps to bring an understanding of what your reading
3,"learned author, mediocre writer","I found his writing unnecessarily difficult to follow. The book is full of knowledge and opinions, which are hard to differentiate. I suppose my expectations were too high. I had hoped for a clear sequential analysis of prophesies. This is written like a legal brief."
5,Revelation Unvieled,"This book is excellent for reading to help explain the things of the ""End Times"". When reading it today, and the current events of the world's condition...it's like reading the newspaper, and listening to the news. It is exciting!!!"
1,Absurd,"An imaginative interpretation of the Book of Revelation. Deeply anti-Catholic. According to LaHaye, the Catholic Church is the Whore of Babylon. Yes, people still believe that. Beware of this bigoted unscholarly tripe."
1,Sound Exegesis Got Left Behind!,"Dr. LaHaye's commentary on Revelation offers a biased, non-scholarly view of Revelation that is based more on a tradition that is less than 200 years old than it is based on sound exegesis. For a real commentary on Revelation, read either George Eldon Ladd's A Commentary on the Revelation of John (Historical Pre-millennial) or Ray Summers' Worthy is the Lamb (Amillennial)."
4,More study for Revelation,"I have read part of the Left Behind series and got bored with them on Book #5. I wanted to understand Revelation more, so I started with this book.Revelation Unveiled takes you through each chapter and verse of Revelation describing what will happen. While reading this book, you need to concentrate on Tim Lahaye's understanding of each verse. You are not going to sit down and read this like a novel. The beginning of the book concerns the letters to the 7 churches. This part seemed the most confusing to me. If you get past the 7 churches, it will be easier to understand.Overall, I found the book a good learning tool. I have gone on to other books for more study of Revelation."
1,Never got it,I tried emailing them twice and never got a response but it's now 9 days past estimated ship time and still nothing. Also. The worst part is they say they shipped it almost month ago!!!! I will never do business again with them
1,Mis-informed anti-Catholic hogwash,"I was highly disappointed after reading this book. I started out reading it with blind enthusiasm, because my wife liked the ""Left Behind"" series so much. The first chapter or so held my attention, then Lahaye started blasting everything the Catholic Church is based on, up to and including the Blessed Virgin Mary! Where did this guy come from? His writing represents more of an Anti-Christ sentiment than a Christian one! He is pure EVIL! The hate spues from the pages like venom. Mr. Lahaye had better pray for forgiveness, and donate all his ill gotten money to some charitable foundations to make some reparation for all the damage he is causing to the Christian beliefs. This book is NOT worth reading, even for fictional entertainment value. God forgive you Mr. Lahaye!"
3,A piece of Revelation unveiled,"Great expectations! That's what I had. A course in Revelation AND a book that I could read and enjoy. OK, OK. Expectations were a bit too high. The course was MUCH deeper than the book. The bits of bashing in this book were not needed. Opinon and teachings were interwoven to the extent that one needs to agree completely with Lahaye. I felt that this book was not very objective and open but somewhat dogmatic and opinionated.Revelation is a very deep book. One can study it at many levels. One needs to be very careful not to add or delete from the teachings. A serious student might have problems with this book by Mr. Lahaye."
1,bias in place of facts and good sense,"This book is so colored by its vehement anti-Catholicism that in many places LaHaye completely digresses from the topic of Revelation and the End Times. LaHaye compares the shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe with the ancient cults of Babylon, and supports his comparison using an apocryphal story about Nimrod--quite a leap for someone who claims to base his beliefs on the ""Bible alone!"" Of course he has every right to interpret the Bible however he sees fit (or however makes him the most profit), but know that almost every ""fact"" he gives about Catholics is an unsubstantiated lie."
1,A poor excuse for biblical exposition,"As a careful student of scripture who uses scripture to explain scripture, I was severely disappointed by this book. A single example will serve to show why everyone should avoid this work.The Seals, Trumpets, and Bowls take up 11 of the 22 chapters of the book of Revelation. They are saturated with Old Testament quotations and allusions. Yet LaHaye doesn't use a single Old Testament passage to help him explain these three series. This is completely inexcusable. But even more, when he considers the first horseman (the first Seal), he completely ignores Revelation's own use of the symbolism of ""white robes"" and the ""crown"" (Greek: stephanos, the crown given to the righteous). By doing this, he turns the meaning of this symbol completely on its head.No one should read this book for anything other than a good example of how not to read the Bible."
1,revelation unvieled,is a good source of information I have always had trouble understanding the book of revelation in the bible this book has helped me to understand more
1,Welcome to fantasy island..,"This book may as well be a science fiction novel. None of the information in this book is based on Sacred Scripture. Where he gets his interpretations of the Book of Revelation, we don't want to know. All of the information on the Catholic faith is completely wrong and he has done no research to substantiate his claims against the Church. The only thing I would recommend this book for is to start your next winter fire with."
1,making money or making disciples?,"Mr. LaHaye is a regular prophecy factory, like so many of his predecessors and peers. However, anyone interested in a historically grounded, accurate understanding of the Bible will have to look elsewhere. It is material like this that makes so many secular people seeking faith turn to anything except the Bible for hope. As someone for whom the Bible has become a key source of wisdom and truth, I find it terribly frustrating that so many think that the cartoon versions of God and Christ offered by Mr. LaHaye resemble the real things."
2,It started as a page turner...,"It started as a page turner. ""This is going to be great!"" was my thoughts, ...for the first twenty pages...Then something diffuse happend to the text. This wasn't the early Jan Guillou. I couldn't feel the nerve. I missed the convincing feeling. ...I felt, ...that this time he had written a story that was meant to be accepted by the female critics. Perhaps I even felt a touch of commercialism that I hadn't felt before. I missed the convincing feeling that allways had surrounded the secondary figures and Hamilton in his first years..."
5,"A good read, and good food, too!","Who would have thought that actually reading a cookbook could be so much fun? My personal preference leans toward cookbooks that offer more than a collection of recipes and this book delights both readers of the classics and contemporary literature, as well as the enthusiastic cookbook collector. I had the good fortune of meeting authors Shaunda Kennedy Wenger and Janet Kay Jensen in a live chat. I was taken by their lively sense of humor and the fun they expressed they had in assembling the recipes to match the excerpts and quotations used throughout the book.You'll find plenty of comfort food to enjoy while you read some great stories, or revisit old favorites."
4,SafClens,"This is a great product to have on hand, My mother is on coumadin and has very thin skin this aids in the healing process. I am a diabetic it works for wounds that occur from mishaps Great product."
5,"Gental Wound Care Clenser, Highly Recommended!","My Wound Care Specialist gave me a bottle of ""SAF-Clens AF"" to use before changing the dressings on my sensitive skin ulcers. This works well either sprayed directly on the skin or onto a gauze-sponge for cleaning the wound area.This is a gental clenser and does not have a strong scent or leave a residue.Highly Recommended!"
2,Book merits 5 stars; cassette is horrible.,"Unless they've changed the audio, cassette features one reader only who reads all poems alike with great fake intensiy, in a muffled voice. My French teacher agreed that the cassette was very poor."
5,Great product for the price!,"I live in NM, in the country. Ticks are a constant problem, and fleas as well. I have been spending more money on the more expensive versions of the spot controls and this brand works great for the price. I use different weight versions on all my different dogs, and use for my cats ( cat version) and I am flea and tick free for a second summer again!"
4,Does the Job for a lot Less,We had been using Frontline but our breeder had mentioned that she uses Bio Spot for her dogs and that it's always worked for her. For $9.99 for a 6 month qty it was totally worth trying especially considering we'd be spending that on one dose of the Frontline. So far so good..he's tick and flea free and we just applied the 2nd dose. I can't see why it's worth paying for Frontline if this does as good of a job. I did notice our pup scratching on occasion but I can't directly correlate it to the Bio Spot....it could be that he just needs a bath :)
4,works as good as the others,i have 3 dogs and not a lot of money and since they dont have fleas already i tried it and it has been wonderful
1,This stuff KILLS pets!,I will never ever ever use this this or any other Hartz insect control product again. I didn't realize THIS was what was making my dog so sick till I stumbled on [...] where I read heart breaking stories of other pets that either developed neurological disorders or died from using this. DON'T DO IT!!
1,not worth the risk,"I'm always amazed that this product is still legal and that people purchase it. I've worked at numerous vet hospitals and dog after dog visit emergency rooms due to reactions to this product. If you're thinking, ""any topical product has risk of adverse reactions"", consider that I never once saw a dog at the ER due to Frontline or Advantage. Yes, these brands are pricey, but for an obvious reason. A trip to an emergency hospital will cost you a lifetime's supply of Frontline or Advantage. And money aside, my dog's health and comfort are not worth that risk."
1,Noooooo!,"I hate giving bad reviews, but I bought for all 3 of my dogs (3 different weights) and it didn't kill ONE flea. They are still crawling all over my dogs 3 weeks later. So Sad."
1,still have fleas,I purchased this item as it was recommended by a friend. I put a dose on one of my dogs on 8-2-2010. Today I checked the dogs as I usually do when we play and found fleas on the dog I had put the product on the 2nd. Both dogs will get bathed today and I will make a trip to the vets office to purchase the more expensive Frontline as I know it will work longer than 2 weeks.
1,Doesn't work.,Bio spot doesn't work. I bought it to try and save money. Guess you get what you pay for. Bought Frontline and it is excellent.
2,Not sure if this even works.,"I started using this product to save money. About 3 months into it, I got a reinfestation. Went back to the ultra expensive name-brand stuff and haven't seen another flea since.To be fair, the Vet said that ANY medicine can occasionally fail to prevent infestations...none are 100% fool proof. But I personally didn't have any lick with this one."
1,Severe adverse reaction,"I tried this product as a cheaper alternative to Frontline, but my 4 yr old, 35 lb mutt had a severe adverse reaction. I put the product on her before bedtime, and the next morning she was twitching, stumbling, and having trouble keeping her balance. A rushed trip to the vet, a deep clean shampoo, and a day of rest and she's fine, but I would never recommend this product."
1,Scary,"I have used this product in the past with no problems, but this time my dog had a seizure 3 days after using this product. Not worth the risk!"
2,small toy,Was a lot smaller than I expected. My daughter had to find a small doll to use that would fit. Because she couldn't use her best baby doll that she loves to play with she lost interest real quick.
4,Hmmmmmmm...........,Hi. I'm wondering if this will fit a 20 inch doll cause I think this is what I need. Hmmmmmmmmmm........... maybe I'll buy it. It's on my wish list so I guess I want it.
2,"Okay product, but not great","I'm a fan of the ""Sightings"" TV show from the 1990's, so I wanted to hang this up on my wall. The description of the product is somewhat misleading. It describes it as a fabric tapestry which makes me think of something thick and non-drooping. It is actually a thin silk cloth (with the image spray-painted on it) that droops when you try to pin it to your wall. This drooping affects how the image looks (especially, the logo). If you stretch it enough, you can make it appear somewhat straight, but it never looks perfect.It is very thin and can tear. It comes folded several times in a very small ""box"" and you have to iron the wrinkles out of it. Also, even though the image does look basicly good, some of the details have been lost in the screen-printing from the original image on the cover of the VHS tape and book. This would have worked much better as a paper poster."
5,Great CD,"I bought this CD after seeing them live, and hearing them for the first time. I went to see a band named Thrice, and these guys were playing, and I was blown away! When these got on stage, I wasn't anticipating what I heard. I saw 4 or so guys dressed up in all black, looking kinda goth like, but then the singer started going, and I couldn't believe it. It was one of the best things I had ever heard. The first reviewer of this CD said something I've thought ever from the beginning, the singer does sound like Ray Cappo, which isn't a bad thing, cuz Youth of Today is one of my favorite bands. But this is such an awesome CD, and the man himself, Davey Havoc, does some back-up vocals too. This CD is a must have for any punk and hardcore fan. Go out and buy this today, and while you're at it, buy and AFI and Thrice CD. It should do you some good."
5,First time is the charm,This was my first cd by Omar. I've spent the better part of 8 years looking for his imports after listening to this CD. If you truly love music and yourself GET THIS CD (if you can find it). VAJRAYAN the Tantric ONE
1,Scammed,"I heard this album many years ago in London. I've wanted it ever since but could not find it here in the US. I decided to treat myself for my birthday when I found it on amazon. I had a big smile on my face when it came this afternoon. Turned on my system, Had my Gallo 3.5 ready to play, opened up the package then my heart sank. The CD was not the full album. My favorite track ""Keep Steppin""was not listed on the dammed thing. I am so pissed off. DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM NEW CHAPTER RECYCLING INC!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Big Noid does ""NOT"" live up to the Moob Deep legend.","Havoc did not take time on beats and Noid himself seems to stumble over his lyrics, He just doesnt hit me in the hart by hiself but when with the ""Infamous"" he does OK."
4,The third of Mobb Deep,"Man they brought out some old gold from the Mobb Deep and Big Noyd on this one. Some familiar lyrics on a couple of tracks with different music that was good. Noyd would have fit in great on all the Mobb Deep classics but we should appreciate the work he did. I get all of his work and this cd is in my top 5 of Big Noyd. The only sucky thing about Episodes of a Hustla is that i think he hustled us out of some tracks! 11 tracks and the first 2 are skits? Intro was cool but we want more Noyd!!!! Only gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because because of only 8 songs and 3 skits, if that doesnt bother you this is a 5"
2,I was sent wide instead of regular width,"I ordered the sneakers that i always wear because I love the fit. They are comfortable all day. However, the sneakers that were delivered to me were wide. As a result, the fit is stiff and not very comfortable"
2,slechers review,I buy this product twice yearly and have done so for over 5 years. This is the first time it's not fit. I don't know if it is the seller or what is it. Had to return them. Disappointing.
2,Not sue what happend this time!,"I had to order my sketchers on here since Sketchers was out of my size, and got them in they were good for only 2 weeks and I had the same issue as T. Hunter did where they have already pulled apart along the seam on the inside right shoe. So now it feels like the toes are loose on them. I don't know what Sketchers has done this year. I had bought so many of this pair before and never had this problem. But I am contacting them to let them know they maybe loosing me as a buyer!We shall see how it goes I just called Sketchers today and they want me to send them back so they can check on them and see if it was a flaw on their part and replace them. Fingers crossed!"
5,Best Sketchers,"Probably the best Sketchers I have owned. Most comfort and they look and feel well made. I need shoes to stand up to my active lifestyle yet are comfortable and soft. I look all over the web for good shoes like these and if you like the sketcher brand these are the best, they are true to size and are a bit wider on fit than other brands. I use these shoes almost everyday, and since I love to wear white shoes, I do wash all my shoes until they fall apart, and that is the greatest measure of quality construction. I have found these to be the best of the sketchers line."
1,Difficult to put on,"I bought the correct size and I have several other Skechers shoes that I love. However, I couldn't put the shoes on. I found them too tight around the top. THe idea of ""slip on"" is really not correct. I think making these shoes with a regular tongue and velcro straps would be a better idea. They would be easy to put on. I returned them the day after they arrived."
3,Ok,Its ok. Got it quick from seller. When i wear them all day they kind of hurt. I thought they would have more cushion.
2,Disappointed in shoe,Have had other slip on Sketchers which fit well- this particular shoe is very hard to get foot into (the hole seems too small.)
4,Great Work Shoe,"I love these shoes for work. They are easy to clean, hold up nicely and are comfortable to wear. I work in a hospital as an xray tech and am on my feet 10 hours a day, with exposure to bodily fluids. One of the reason I love these shoes is that they have very little fabric and no shoe laces that can get yucky. They can be wiped cleaned very easily. Also love the leather, durable. Is a little stiff at first but after a couple days they mold to your feet."
4,Excellent book for serious rock hounds & geology students,"This book is arranged according to the mineral classifications, which is good if you know your minerals. The mineral testing section (flame tests, bead tests, etc.) is not found in very many field guides. As a professional Geologist, I would recommend this to other geologists, not to rock hounds. The National Audubon Society's field guide is better for rock hounds; there are more photos and they are arranged by color. The Audubon's minerals are still by classification, but the testing information is not included."
2,a great handbook but a cheap binding,"This is the definitive handbook for the rockhound. Nicely updated with more and better pictures to help in identification of rocks and minerals. Too bad that Peterson's decided to save a nickel on the binding -- my copy of ""Rocks and Minerals"" was splitting out within a week.I've had other Peterson's Field Guides which were softcover but HARD bound. These are useful handbooks that will last a lifetime.If you buy a cheap paperback to read once, the binding isn't of much concern. A ""field guide"" deserves better.The ""Cambridge Guide to Minerals Rocks and Fossils"" is just about as good, is about the same price, and has sewn in pages."
3,From a geology major,"I use this for my geochemistry/mineralogy class. The descriptions of minerals are very in-depth and good for those who understand what it's describing, but not so good for the layman. The color plates are quite nice. For the layman, I'd recommend the Golden Guide to Rocks and Minerals, as it has more images of the minerals in question. I'm also disappointed at the complete dearth of rock entries in this field guide. As one is most likely to encounter rocks as opposed to standalone minerals in the field, a guide with a greater focus on rocks would have been a great addition. I'm also disappointed that this guide does not go into detail on mineral lattice structures."
4,Exactly what I expected,"Not much to say other than it is informative and easy to use and understand. Good illustration and photos as well as many ""old school"" testing techniques. Should be in your pocket while out collecting."
3,Bought it for my 8-yr old,"I bought this book for my 8-year old daughter who is really into gems. It is really too old for her, and has few pictures. I'm sure it is fine for someone older."
4,GM 3.4L Timing Tools,"Just as the previous review stated, I also had to adjust my cam sprocket holder (J38614 - the 3/8"" square drive tool with three lugs). The lugs were not 90 degrees to the base, requiring the inside surface of each to be filed to fit between gear spokes. After modifying, the tool worked great on my 95 cutlass supreme 3.4L"
4,auto tools,Cam Timing Tools arrived as promised ! Did need to adjust the cam gear holders to actually fit the application ( 94 olds 3.4 ) could not have done the job without them !!!
2,I can't smile.,Sorry but I can't give this more stars. It wasvery disappointing after I heard SiOGo and washoping for more of the same. While Siogo isdifferent it still is a masterpiece and lovedthe keyboard addition of Hensley but this fallsflat. I think they just wanted to get it overwith. While some songs aren't bad I'd ratherlisten to something else. SIOGO!
1,MORNING DOO DOO,"We have Al Nalli to thank for turning one of of the hardest rockin bands ever into a band that was more concerned with hair and spandex then guitars and lyrics.This was the end for this awesome band from the south , this cd is for fanatics of Blackfoot only.Ray"
2,Blackfoot lost their former edge,"""Vertical smiles"" is the most radio friendly sounding album by southern rockers Blackfoot. It can't compete at all with the previous excellent ""Siogo"" (which also had a tendency to be more towards the commercial side than earlier albums). But as usual there are a couple of songs that are very good, especially ""In for the kill"". But the overall impression is that it's too slick and polished, and lack the edge Blackfoot showed on ""Strikes"" and ""Marauder"". If you're looking for a first taste of Blackfoot, I don't think ""Vertical smiles"" is the best album to get."
3,Has about three songs I like on it,"Most of this cd sounds like Blackfoot trying to do foreigner or something doesn't quite work, but it does have two really excellent songs on it young girl (I think one of their best songs) and summers days..the cover for morning dew is good too, but the rest of the cd just doesn't do much for me. Much better to have in print if there is something on here you like instead of paying a ridiculous price for a so, so cd"
5,Hot Debut C.D. Visit Amber's Message Board at VH1.com,"I love Amber's music. In my opinion, Amber should be rated as highly as Madonna. ""This Is Your Night"" is the album that stated it all. Her voice is smooth and beautiful, it reminds me of fellow R&B-Soul/Club diva Jody Watley. My favourite tracks are the title track, ""Move Your Body"", ""Colour of Love"", the sensual ""One More Night"", her cover of ""Being With You"" by Roberta Flack, ""This is the Right Time"", ""Push It to the Limit"" and the funky R&B track ""Are You the One"". The house mixes of ""This Is Your Night"" and ""Colour of Love"" are superbly done! Overall a fine debut album A-."
1,Devoid of Life (Ultimate Producer Driven Disc),Very generic. No soul. No substance. No life. No emotion from the artist. No creativity. No nothing.
1,Buyer Beware,"I'm truly sorry I bought this software. The ad blocker and pop up blocker are far weaker than the 2003 version. The ad/popup ad blocker dose not work on this version. The automated support system on Symantec's website is hard to find answers and frustrating to navigate. The privacy monitor is a good concept, but a pain to work with, especially in email. The only thing I trust in this product to work is the virus scan utilities. Everything else is hit or miss depending on the day. I'm extremely disappointed with this software."
1,Sadly -- lost integrity,"I have been using Norton products only since about1986, but I'm ready to switch. All manner of problems with this program never seen in previous editions. Instructions and support seriously inadequate at all levels.I have used this version on two machines -- spent days trying to clean a botched installation [I believe not by me, but the installation program] on one machine. Now a month-old installation an a new desktop is failing. Spent hours with ""knowledge"" base and incomprehensible advice. Then, for a $29.95 phone call, received numerous recorded ""we are too busy to talk to you even if you pay us."" Then, a rude and sarcastic rep, who dumped my into an uninstall routine that failed, disconnected my call, and refused to hear symptoms."
1,Kills internet connection 0 stars,"NIS 2004 Pro on XP Home gave me 100% protection, by killing my ADSL internet connection altogether (a novel approach!).Although it set up fine, it slowed the computer down once installed and killed email and browsers.I could still ping servers on the net, but couldn't make any other type of connection. This was despite fiddling with the firewall rules for hours and looking for clashing drivers.It also dumped my ActiveSync partnership between the pc and my ipaq, so I had to redo those settings.After uninstalling the first time I had to add a network connection to get on the net.After uninstalling the second time no added network connections work, I'm still not on the net a week later.Like others said the evaluation of Zone Alarm Pro works seamlessly for me, has a smaller footprint, is less invasive, and actually uninstalls itself if asked!"
1,McAfee users: don't expect to get the rebate from Norton,"The $30 rebate form says it is for current upgrade users and users of competitors products. I used to use McAfee and switched to NIS Pro. Rebate was denied cuz of ""invalid proof of previous purchase"". Point of the matter is I am not a previous user, I switched from a competitor. So get this if you want to switch but don't hold your breath on the rebate. Not a bad product but not a great one either. I will not renew when the term is up. It is difficult to use when you want to stream in video media because it thinks you are under attack."
3,success has made them arrogant,"Internet Security 2004 has done a good job of keeping me virus free (so far as I know) but their Customer Service is very poor. I ran a google check on ""norton"", ""customer service"", arrogant and got about 700 hits (OK not all relevant)- they are ARROGANT. If you try to contact a person with an actual product problem, they are not interested unless you want to pay for the time.The case in point is that with my OE6 email anti-spam, certain emails cause the sorter to freeze and block the download indefinitely until OE times out. The only solution I have found is to exit OE6 and disable the antispammer. I have sent them an email about this problem but they simply ignored it. The firewall can also be quirky in that it does not inform you when it is blocking access to some applications and you just sit and wait - again you have to disable Norton to get that access.Lousy customer service has made me derate 2 stars."
1,Bad Product For Developers..,"The ""Norton/Symantic"" Shepard is much worse than the ""Adware"" Wolf. If you are a developer or need access to local development tools such as IIS, DON'T INSTALL THIS PRODUCT. I'm sorry I didn't read the Amazon reviews before I installed. It'll kill your machine's speed, IIS localhost and you'll either have to reformat OR IF YOUR LUCKY Restore to an earlier restore point. - (thanks to windows XP restore). I was lucky. Worst part is that there's no way to get a refund. I can't imagine how a large company like Symantec could put out such an ill conceived product - and even worse - a very sick help-and-support department. Talk about internet wolves. Get McAffee for antivirus and ZoneAlarm for Internet Security. Much better."
1,Simply awful,"My husband was so frustrated with MANY problems that he finally uninstalled the whole mess. Even getting it off his machine took 2 days. For the first time in his life, he considered suicide.It slowed my PC down (and I have a new AMD). I cannot access IE without disabling Internet Security Professional (this started out of the blue a couple months ago). I'm afraid to even try to uninstall it. I'll probably end up taking it in to a shop and having them uninstall it - and paying.I will never buy from Norton again. I thought Norton was supposed to have a reputable product. It's trash."
2,Wish I hadn't upgraded to 2004,"Way too restrictive and/or buggy. I am constantly having to turn this off to get to some web pages. So I am in greater danger than I was before. Have spent several hours trying to tune the thing per their website support instructions but it doesn't seem to do any good. Very disappointed. Never had these problems with 2003 version. I would avoid until you start seeing some positive comments or they come out with some fixes.Update - please read the June 2004 PC World eval of firewalls. Described Norton as sluggish, etc. I took it off and installed their recommendation of PC Cillin. What a difference, my PC has gotten it's speed back. And my problems have gone away."
1,What a piece of junk Zero Stars,"What a piece of junk:It did not install properly, it states support for Eudora email, bit it does not w0rk.ZoneAlarm is much better firewall, simple and works.The worst part is the uninstall does not work. The only way to uninstall it is to download rnav2003.exe from symantec to remove this piece of junk from the registry. It is amazing that they ship a program that does not unintall yet they seem to know what is wrong and have fixed it with their rnav2003 utility program.Do not waste your time or money on this piece of junk"
1,Great for turning your computer into junk,"Took an hour to install, no errors. Required me to activate even before it completed installation, even before I knew it would work. After installing, it took 20 minutes to reboot my 1.8 GHz computer. After reboot, spent the next 3 hours doing updates with a cable connection. After all was installed and updated, I could not access the Internet, but everyone else could access my computer. I could not open MS Office files, and creating a 1 MB zip file took 45 minutes because NIS had to repeatedly scan the file as it was being made. It disabled my ADD/REMOVE programs so I couldn't even uninstall it. Will be spending my weekend reinstalling all my software after wiping my drive clean to uninstall this program."
1,"Kills IIS forever! stops working after hardware changes, etc","This is pure junk. You will never get IIS to work, even after uninstalling NIS! Do you know why? Because it considers your desktop as a server and so it will prevent IIS to run. Why? Because Symantec wants you to buy the corporate version, for servers, which is much more expensive.The registration is based on your hardware and there is a limit of registration attempts (not indicated anywhere explicitly). If you change a few components in your computer, it will stop working, a crash can easily corrupt it as well. You can't use it in an image file (driveimage or so) already registered because it won't work.Customer support? In one word: nasty! They reply by email asking you to call the 1-800 number, of course won't be able to talk to anyone unless you wait for a loooong time."
1,goa somewhere else,"I must admit that I have not heard this CD set. Being a Goa-fanatic, though, I consider myself and expert, and I maybe recognize 1 or 2 artists between all 3 CDs in the set. If you are looking for the true Goa experience (or introduction), I would suggest looking somewhere else.The music on these CDs may be fantastic, but the definitive Goa experience it is not."
2,"SOME CALL IT STALKING, I CALL IT LOVE","Originally released as Match.dead. The movie was supposed to be about online dating and killers, but it never hit on all cylinders with that theme, so the name was changed to fit the movie they made. (Not a good sign.)James Ray plays a psychotic killer. He is a young buff version of G. Gordon Liddy. He doesn't kill to make skin masks, but rather to just thin out the herd of human existence to make room on the planet. He does this from his desert home. Kathleen Benner plays Valora Smith, a woman he has abducted. He has a fancy for her, so he doesn't kill her, but attempts to get her to like him...in his own way. Valora sports a t-shirt that reads, ""Some call it stalking, I call it love."" She is not very likable either, and seriously lacks personality. She relies on memories from growing up with grandpa (a John Wayne type) to give her strength and at times guidance.Occasional f-bomb, sexual situations (no rape) and nudity- Earl's butt."
1,Horrible Movie,"This was a terrible movie! don't waste your time or money. No plot, horrible acting, not enough ""damsel in distress"", just plain stupid. I will never get that time back."
1,Cheap A** Movie!!!,"Horrible movie. The plot sounded like it would be okay, but it was very cheaply made. Translation: Horrible acting, vomit dialogue, and the shooting was amateur at best! I spent the entire movie fast forwarding every now and then just so that it would get over sooner!!! If I could I wouldn't give it any stars at all!!!"
3,"Decent acting, thin story line, no nudity","Maybe the ""no nudity"" part was disappointing, because I was actually looking forward to seeing Kathleen Benner nude. I thought James Ray did a better job of acting his part than Benner did."
5,the american country inn and bed and breakfast cookbook,This cookbook is great !!!! i borrowed it from a friend and never gave it back (bad!!!) but it really is a great source for entertaining. Fanstastic and easy recipes. A good way to impress your friends with your cooking. Also what i like is they usually have serveral recipes for similar dishes so lets say you want to make scalloped potatoes - you can look at them all and then kind of use the info to make your own variation with the pieces of the recipes you think sound good. Also it is good if you are doing theme parties. I love asian cooking we were having a party where i needed to bring an asian salad - they have like 5 different types. and they arent what you would expect. Note this is just not breakfast foods - all types of cooking are in this book and from all types of us regions.
5,It's my 'go to' cookbook of choice!,"I can't you how many times I've gone to my copy of this cookbook for recipes... it's the one I reach for first! It's like taking a trip around the country without leaving my home! VERY user friendly format, too!I love the small-sized recipes that many of the B&B's and Inns use... hubby and I are 'empty nesters' most of the year with our sons away at college so there's no need to make big meals or we'd be eating leftovers forever."
5,Terrific cookbook for special occasions,"I really enjoyed this cookbook. It's a great resource for special occasions/entertaining. I have found their baking recipes are excellent. If you loved a particular dish from a B & B, you might just find it here."
5,A Classic of Jazz and Blues,I can't believe I am only the second person to review this album. It is one of the finest jazz and blues of all time. Lou has soul- the sound samples speak for themselves. The jazz arrangements by Benny Carter are outstanding as are Lou's smooth vocals. This IS the great unknown jazz and blues recording...buy it!
5,Doggie gone good...,"How can you not like this manga? I admit, the cover was the first thing that had attracted me-bondages maybe? After glancing at the artwork, I soon fell in love. Ayume and Hyoue are two very likeable characters, each filling in what the other person lacked. I always find myself looking for the next volume when I go to a bookstore. Amazing storyline, I would recommend it to everyone."
1,"very few pictures,not of interest to artists or sculptors","i believe it was written to complete a grant,a few toaken pictures,& very dry reading. not recomended for artest or sculptor."
1,"Cheap, leaks",Never able to use this as it was made poorly and leaked even after following instructions carefully. Would not recommend.
1,Item never came,"Terrible experience. The original company was out of stock of the item, but oddly, I received an email from another company saying the item ""shipped."" However, no item ever arrived and I had to send emails to affirm that the item was in fact, never coming. Meanwhile, my customers were out of a tuner. I will not be using this avenue again to order Seiko product."
2,Stopped working after using twice,"Used twice and when I went to use for the third time, it didn't work. I heard something rattling inside.It's also not as powerful as a Wahl."
5,Overlord: D-Day and Battle for Normandy--Max Hastings,"This overview of D-Day and the Normandy battle is an incredibly rich and nuanced study of this critical battle in World War II. It is replete with vivid descriptions of the actual fighting and incisive analysis of the strategies and motives of the German and Allied commanders. I read this volume after having read two other Hasting's books on WWII--Armaggedon and Retribution--both brilliant analyses of the last two years of the war against Germany and Japan, respectively. But his D-Day book, published earlier (1984) is still a terrfic read and may remain the best one-volume history of this campaign."
2,Poor edition,"The paper edition of this book is poorly done--print jammed on the page, small and crowded, maps too small to read, poor quality photos, etc. It almost looked as if the pages had been photographed from another edition and reduced in size to fit on a smaller page. After looking through it, I ordered the more expensive hard-cover edition."
5,"A superb, unvarnished military history","Hastings strips away the mythology of the ""triumphant"" march across Western Europe from D-Day to the Falaise Gap. We see instead often confused, all too timid generalship, poor training and worse execution that may have lengthened the European war by months.Hastings is the very best of the current crop of WWII historians.Jerry"
3,Harumph!,"Ya Know, I wish that amazon would expand the review system cuz 1 to 5 stars doesn't cut it. When I was a kid I idolized my big brother and any music he listened to, therefore from that perspective this album gets 12 stars. From a musical perspective it gets somewhere between 1.5 - 2. That being said it is a pretty good american metal album. I don't like to compare it to Maiden or Metallica because it's not the same thing. It's just cheesy L.A. Rock/Metal/Glam but in my opinion it's better than most of what came after it. e.g. Warrant, Poison, Winger, etc. So if your in the mood for some good 80's Rock/Metal I think you might enjoy this, but don't expect too much from it."
5,Awesome album,This is one of WASPs best albums! Intense lyrics and hard driving music. A good listen for those like Me in the BDSM community!
4,Hair band? NO. Its W.A.S.P.,"W.A.S.P is one of my favorite bands of all time. Blackie and company deliver with almost every album. Now I'm not a big fan of the blood, guts, sex, ect ect they had in the early years. I focus on the talent of a band. Now believe me WASP has as much talent as everyone else. It wasnt really shown until The Headless Children. But I will give this album props because of the songs I Wanna Be Somebody, BAD, Tormentor, Hellion, and LOVE machine. This album is catchy as hell and proves that WASP had something different to add than most other bands in this genre at that time. Now yes I didnt say I liked Animal, and truth is...its an okay songs when you look at what they had in the future (Headless Children, Crimson Idol). Overall, if you are just getting into WASP buy this album to learn of their beginnings and you too will see that over time, they aged really well and released better albums."
4,Purple Moon,Pretty good movie although somehow pretty stereotypical of the Civil War in Spain.Ana Belén & Miguel Bosé are better as singers than actors.It had better reviews abroad (Europe & US) than in Spain.
3,"Beautiful pictures, lite prose","For 12 pages, the book discusses the interaction of plants and wildlife. Another 12 pages offer basic tips on planting, plus a few projects. The remaining 115 pages offer 'plant directory'. Each plant gets 1-2 pages, including a wonderful color photos. The photos are magnificent, but the discussion relatively uninformative.I found ""Great Garden Companions : A Companion-Planting System for a Beautiful, Chemical-Free Vegetable Garden"" by Sally Jean Cunningham far more helpful."
1,Recommends common invasives which negatively impact wildlife habitat,I purchased this book because I do gardening for wildlife in Florida and thought it would be a good read. I was appalled that one of the plants recommended was English Ivy which is a major exotic invasive in the United States which has negative impacts on our natural areas. To recommend a common invasive that Governments spend millions of dollars to remove so it doesn't hurt our wildlife doesn't speak well of this as a reference guide.Pass this one up.
5,DELIGHTFUL ENTERTAINMENT,"I was impressed with Steve Colbert as president. His TV persona showed through in this left of center satire on monster and alien movies. It is a movie that parents will find entertaining as well.There is a reference to Susan's boobies and a scene where the military man scans his butt to enter a room. That is pretty much the extent of objectionable material. The movie starts out with Susan getting married in a Unitarian(?)church (no Christian symbols) when she is struck by a meteorite which turns her into the 50 foot woman. The military subdues her like Lilliputians and imprisons her with other monsters (interment camp).When an alien robot attacks the earth, the monsters are let loose to save the planet and win their freedom in return. If your kids liked Mars Attacks, they will enjoy this movie. I know I did and so did my grandniece (third-fourth grade)."
5,monster vs aliens,"Great movie. Quality of the pictures is wonderful, storyline is very good the only negative thing that I can say about this movie is on the bonus 3D features. When I used the provided 3D glasses the colors does not look good, matter of fact is that it also created alot of ghosting moving images and blurry moving scenes. Other then that everything else are absolutely well beyond my expectations."
4,"Saw in the Theater, Had to get it for the home","My boys (including my husband) and I loved this movie. I knew when we were leaving the theater I'd be buying the movie. The characters are great. BOB is hilarious, which is expected from Seth Rogan. Reese Witherspoon does very well in this movie, which is great because I normally don't care for her. The only complaint I have about this, which I didn't realize until I actually received the Blu Ray, is that it's only Blu Ray. Most Disney DVDs come in a DVD/Blu Ray combo and I strongly feel that, if nothing else, other companies that make kids movies should offer their movies in DVD/Blu-Ray combos. My kids can only watch this in the living room on our PS3. We had to buy the actual DVD to accommodate being able to watch this in other rooms. Good job for Disney for recognizing this and making those combos. Had it been a combo disc, it would have gotten 5 stars without question."
1,Wouldn't have bought if I'd known NO 3D!!,"I was excited when this movie came out. I didn't get to go see this in the theater when my husband and daughter went, so I went out and bought it as soon as it came out. That evening the family gathered around the tv with our 3D glasses on, only to be extremely disappointed!! For some reason they thought that the home viewing wouldn't do the 3D justice. (even though every other movie that's released in the theaters in 3D is also released on the DVD with the 3D option). Also, we have a tv that is 3D capable. This company should have at least given us a chance to watch it in 3D. Packaging was misleading and I am very frustrated!"
2,No surprises.,"This piece of product follows the same tired formula as other DreamWorks Animation projects - insert stale pop-culture references, use a by-the-numbers plot, take some stock characters off the shelf, give it a nice CGI sheen, and throw it out there. Loved the trailer, hoped for more, and found it was even less than I usually expect from this bunch. Avoid unless your kids dig anything in color that moves (granted, that's most kids, but...)."
1,Like monsters? Into aliens? Stay away from this sucker!,"Quite possibly one of the most anticipated, and most disappointing, movies in all of kid-movie history, this cliche-ridden watered-down blob of corporate media muck is to be avoided at all costs. 20 minutes in, my kids and I looked at each other hoping it would turn around. 40 minutes in one of 'em was asleep. 60 minutes in the other one looked like he was going to punch someone out. 80 minutes in we were getting our money back. Time is valuable; don't waste it on this pooper."
1,Disgrateful writing!,"Monsters vs. Aliens gives Science-Fiction a BAD NAME!Animation was doing just fine, until Dreamworks took over!Down with Dreamworks, with their sick sense of humor they put in their GARBAGE!"
5,Big Fun!,"We saw this again today at the theater. Lots of fun for the adults and the 8-12 year old kids. Is it a deep thinking, thought provoking film? No way. Is it great summer fun? Absolutely! Of course since my wife's first name is Susan it delivers even more laughs."
4,"The 50 ft. Woman Meets Mothra, and The Creature, and The Blob, and...","Another movie that accomplishes the difficult feat of appealing to all ages. If you love old B-grade (or lower!) monster movies like Attack of the 50 Ft Woman, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Blob, etc. you will feel right at home inside this movie. But there's a twist: the monsters actually turn into the heroes of the movie, saving the planet while poking fun at themselves at the same time.Kids will love the Ice Age quality slapstick and adults will have fun remembering all those old movie monsters, which this time around are brilliantly CGI animated.I won't tell you the ending but suffice to say it leaves it open for a sequel which of course will appear in a couple of years. Let's see, what old monster movies have they not ripped off, er, I mean ""paid tribute to?!"""
4,"Nice Story, Nice Moral","Not my favorite for 2009, but definitely a movie with a moral behind it presented in a fun way. Monsters and aliens presented in a humorous way."
3,Interesting idea,"I love kids movies, but this one didn't enthrall me. I love Seth Rogan, but his laugh makes me want to punch myself in the face. Overall, it should keep the kids entertained, but make sure you don't have to be in the room when the kids make you put it on repeat."
3,"Fun movie, but not 3-D at home","At least not in this packaging. Though it doesn't mislead you or anything, it just isn't in 3-D. The movie is fun and the Blu-Ray disk look good though."
3,Monsters vs Aliens on Blu Ray,"Clever film that is well designed and nicely produced. I like the character designs, and the animation is really top notch for a Dreamworks film, however, the film has no more depth that a typical Saturday morning cartoon. Enjoyable to watch the first time, its certainly not a film I will watch again and again as it lacks the emotional depth from Dreamworks previous film Kung Fu Panda, which I felt was an excellent film and very obviously Dreamworks best. Too bad they couldn't take an idea like MvA and give it the same treatment."
4,A blu-ray only buy?,"This movie definitely has replay value for kids, which is the movie's audience. Personally I wouldn't buy it in standard definition as it isn't the best kids movie ever, but it definitely looks great in HD and is enjoyable to watch again for the animation (if not the story). My son loves the movie and really that's all that matters."
4,Good fun for kids and grownups!,"My friend and I went to this with kids aged 3, 8 and 12 and everybody loved it! We saw it in 2D and did not feel like we were missing anything. There's a lot of cleverness in here about old monster movies, great sight gags, turning some movie conventions on their heads. The characters are not as deeply developed as those in, say, Up! or Shrek, but this is a MONSTER movie with ALIENS, it is an homage! It's not meant to be a Message movie, just good fun, and it delivers. There is some good action but also a lot of plot. The characters are smart and interesting, and the movie never talks down to its audience like so many kids' movies do. My 3yo daughter did not find it too scary, despite the name it is not loud & frenetic (as opposed to the latest Ice Age, which we almost had to walk out of). Watch it with a big bowl of popcorn as a weekend matinee!"
1,IT'S NOT BLU-RAY 3-D DISC,"BEWARE IT'S NOT BLU-RAY 3-D FOR USE IN 3D TV WITH 3-D BLU-RAY PLAYER USING ACTIVE SHUTTER GLASSES, i just made a mistake based on some review here that (saying it's a 3-D from start to finish) but i got the disc it's not, the extra has 3-d for just 15 minutes, using a paper frame with magenta and cyan lens - the anaglyph 3-D, in short the old school 3-D."
3,fun kids flick,"My kids are pretty nuts for this film. For myself, these are all kind of the same: strange powers, new friends, discovery of inner strength to use said powers effectively against a serious baddie, then possible sequel. While there was nothing much new to this for a jaded adult, there are lots of funny quirky things in it that delight my kids. They like the normal gal getting big and strong and her superhero colleagues are usual, from the brainless blob to the skyscraper-sized butterfly. I most enjoyed the references to other films in it, which were quite witty, e.g. the Star Wars tones didn't work with the alien robot. The politicians are also bumbly hilarious.REcommended. It ain't as smart as, say, Shrek, but entertaining nonetheless."
4,Good For Renting,"Continuing the kids-friendly video borrowing, I recently saw Monsters vs Aliens.This is a terrific movie. It was a great counter to the failure that was Where the Wild Things Are.There is a secret government group comprised of monsters. These monsters are released to combat an alien bent on the earth's enslavement.While this was released in 3D, I was unable to see it in that format.The voices are provided by: Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett, Kiefer Sutherland, Stephen Colbert and many others.Casting Colbert as the President was genius. He steals the show. Every single line is laugh out loud. My particular favorite has to do with ""Code Brown"" because he has to change his pants.Dreamworks has been trying to steal some of the thunder from Pixar for years. This film is great for the entire family to watch and not have to worry about subtle, inappropriate humor.Rent this tonight!"
3,Good enough to watch a few times,"This is not an instant classic, but cute and fun for kids, my son sort of lost interest about 2/3 of the way through, but he is only 4."
4,Fun for all ages,"From a child's perspective, monsters plus aliens speaks for itself. I have a 3 year old daughter that loves stuff like this so I'm gonna say it depends on the kid. I enjoyed the sci fi inside jokes for adults. I do not care as much for the quality of the streaming image that seems to fluctuate throughout the experience. The movie gets 4 stars but amazon gets a warning. Blu ray still exists and so does iTunes so step it up amazon if you wanna stay in the running."
5,Monsters vs aliens,"A simple story, easy to follow and well executed. Visually interesting and colorful. Makes use of intelligable voice actors and varied space techniques."
4,Monsters vs Aliens,A very good movie for young and old. My 4 year old grandson and my 9 year old grandaughter both loved this along with their mother and I. We thought it was a terrific show.
5,monsters vs aliens,"Don't listen to anyone who gave this movie a under 4 star review. They clearly have not seen enough movies to know what a bad movie is. Anyway, this movie was really funny. A person in a great deep depression would end up laughing and being happy by the end. I loved bob, The American president and everyone else. The voice overs were good and everything was as real as it could get. This movie is for people of all ages."
4,Cool film,"I wasn't really excited about this film till I caught on with the story. The monsters referred to are mutated earthlings that have been imprisoned by the US government. When alien invaders threaten earth, who can save us...well of course the mutants.Story is good, animation is excellent. Secondary storyline is relevant, Susan, her fiance and their relationship dynamics. Cute twist with mutant bug/weevel close to end of film."
5,3D effects excellent,"Just purchased this movie and love the 3D effects - they are well done and numerous through out the movie, excellent movie for the family to enjoy.."
3,Not what I expected.,It was a cute movie but not what I had expected. The humor was more for adults and the story line was a stretch.
4,M vs. A . . . Good but . . .,"Great feature . . . bonus was too short. Really needed to have access to a digital copy though. Ah Dreamworks, still need to learn from Pixar / Disney."
2,Not very a very well thought out plotline,"To sum up, This whole movie could have been cut down to a 30 minute TV show and not lost a bit of plot in the process. The story didn't warrant a whole movie built around it. I'm glad I watched it for free at my sister's and didn't spend any money to see it in theaters, or buy it, or rent it. It's not completely unentertaining, but it takes a really long time to get where it's going. And when you get there, you may feel a bit disappointed. You aren't going to see anything new here. The characters are ok and the voice actors are only as good as the script allows. If your kids like Pixar or Dreamworks computer animated films, they'll probably watch it and not get bored the first time."
4,"Pretty Funny, Actually","I didn't realize so many names were in this movie! ha ha. It made it more enjoyable for my kids father and I to watch it with them. They enjoyed it, still do; I enjoy listening and watching it over and over again, too! I would recommend it."
4,Kids Love It!,"This is one of my children's favorite moving. Another one where the good guys win, but with 4-year-olds, we need some of those types of movies in our collection."
4,Good a must have in the collection,good movie. stunning graphics and fast shipping to sweden. The 3D effect of the film i more like looking thru a window then objects flying out the tv. dreamworks as usual make great 3d films.
2,Fun for the kids,We watch this from time to time and I live the vintage 50/60's monster movie feel to it. Does Reece do anything bad? Fun.
3,I was expecting more!,"I give this an ""average"" review. This was very plain and not even something that I can show my kids do to some of the content.I'm very disappointed with the main story line but I did like the alternate story line of B.O.B.'s big break.That will be something that I can show my kids. I think that this was a setup for a Saturday morning cartoon lineup. Just like the penguins did.I don't fault Dreamworks one bit about wanting to make a buck, but this was really a straight to DVD sort of production.It seemed very edited and cut-up with a loss of continuity of both character and the story line.Go rent it or pick it up at your local library. I wouldn't spend the money if I had it to do over again."
3,cute movie but not all that,This was simply a big Sat morn cartoon with nothing really original. It was watchable but that is it.
1,A Lousy Trick,"The movie is great, but I feel the packaging was intentionally meant to lead you to believe that the movie was in 3D, when it is not. Who cares about a 3D ""Extra"". After buying the movie and scrambline to find additional 3D glasses for the fam, I felt more than a little jaded when my disappointed kids had to watch it in 2D."
3,Not the Greatest,"As a student of Spanish, I like to read novels written in Spanish. Generally I choose books written for young adults so the vocabulary will be easier. I highly recommend the Harry Potter series by the way.Even with the simpler vocabulary I find myself having to look up certain words. Unfortunately many times the Collins Dictionary didn't contain the word I was searching for but I could find it in my other dictionary, the Langenscheidt's Pocket dictionary. It is smaller (but thicker) than the Collins which is more of a standard paperback book size.I bought the Collins based upon reviews I read on Amazon, but definitely feel the Langenscheidt's is superior."
4,A great introductory companion for the study of history,"I was assigned this book for my historical methods course while in college. Throughout my time as a history major, it proved to be very helpful. The most important aspects of the book, for me, were the citation and format examples. It is common knowledge that one can just buy a style guide book, but Benjamin's effort provides the context in which it should be used. The listings of where to find information on the web as well as in journals, monographs, etc. is priceless. Another book that was assigned for my course that I feel was more helpful in my study of historiography and how to view history was Edward Hallet Carr'sWhat Is History?I highly recommend both of these books for the college history student or someone that is interested in the methodology of history."
3,Good Overall Reference,"I would not say that this book is CRITICAL to being a good history student but it has certainly helped. Benjamin lays everything out in basics and is well-organized. I do appreciate the fact that he does give credit to finding information on the Internet as that is becoming the dominant form of ""net-casting"" for most college students."
5,Classic Hollywood musical,"A delightful comedic pairing of the ever-babilicious Rita Hayworth and the ever-dashing Fred Astaire... A followup to their earlier hit, ""You'll Never Be Rich."" The pacing on this film is great -- it hardly drags at all, has a great ensemble and some genuinely funny routines. The action is set in Argentina (although there's nary a bad accent to be heard in the entire film), and Latin bandleader Xavier Cugat provides all the musical backup. He also gets a BIG speaking part -- if you really want to see Cugie in full swing, this movie is the one to check out! His vocalist, the renowned Miguelito Valdes is also featured in a number at the film's start... Astaire, of course, is also a wonder to behold; these songs aren't his best, but he still shines while performing them! Recommended."
2,You were never lovelier,"Firstly, it plays automatically in Russian but luckily there was someone around who knew how to turn the Russian off as there are no English instructions! The film itself is pretty awful, just saved by some good Fred Astaire dances!"
4,Classic Fred Astaire!,I love this movie. One of the best musicals ever! The picture quality is as I recall seeing in VHS player back in the days. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the delay in receiving the item--over 2 weeks later than the promised date.
5,Old time great movie,"These old movies with dancers like Fred Astaire, Rita Hayworth, etc. are just wonderful to watch. Such grace. Easier on the eyes than todays dancers...."
3,Interesting but stilted,"An interesting but, but rather stilted. Of course, this was written by Mussolini prior to the rise to power of Adolf Hitler in Germany. The amazing thing to me is that the edition I read had an introduction penned in the 1920s praising Mussolini that was written by the American Ambassador to Italy. I bet he wished he could have taken that introduction back ten years later."
5,A Woman of Egypt,"I was living in Saudi Arabia with my husband for several years. Last summer, a German friend of mine gave me this book translated into German. I was completely captivated by the contents of which I knew very little and the interesting way Ms. Sadat wrote about her life. It was definitely a revelation to me how deeply rooted the problems in the Middle East between Egypt and Isreal were already at the time. Whether this my suggestion belongs into this review or not: I wished the book was made more public - I could not find it this past summer anywhere in a bookstore. (Competitive store)only showed the German title. Every American should read the book in order understand the unsurmountable problems between Jews and Arabs in the region to this day.As to Madame Sadat: What a courageous, dedicated women she was in a Muslim country, combining her deep faith with her progressive ideas."
4,Probably the best source of what Jehan Sadat did for Egypt.,"As can be expected, this book is the best source for what Jehan Sadat did in Egypt before, during, and after Sadat's presidency. Well-written and interesting, this book details her life with and without Anwar Sadat from a unique point of view. Well worth reading. Please note- I am an engineer, not that interested in the Middle East, and even I could not stop reading"
4,Informational,This book is a biography of Jehan Sadat. I enjoyed how she described the background of Egypt in a very respectful way. I didn't feel that Israel's character as a country was assasinated which I appreciated.
3,an excellent book,"may be it's too late to read this book (out of print or unavailable edition) but I think it is a excellent book written by a courageous woman. In fact, it's not easy to be a woman and specially a president's husband in some arabic countries. However, I just want to remark that the Tunisian president never refugiated in Egypt, as written in the book."
5,A great combination of romance and suspense,"The second book in the Gallaher Justice series, Secret Admirer carries a connection to The Littlest Witness, yet has its own story of romance and suspense. I did not suspect who the villain was; it kept me guessing right up to the end. I am eager to read Forbidden Lover, the third book in this trilogy."
5,A great book!,"Into That Good Night may well be the best book I've ever read. Having been raised in a small Texas town in the same era, it really hit home. Ron's story of life's experiences, of loves and losses, is a heart felt story that is enjoyable and easy to read. It is a wonderfully written story of growing up when racism was really becoming an issue in the south, of his beloved father's Alzheimers, and much, much more. I highly recommend this book."
3,jock jams 2 review,"The Jock Jams number two could have had a mega mix because of the Jock Rock one,Slam Jams one,and Jock Jams one.And,the mega mix could have still been really good.That's why I gave it four stars."
1,MY FAVORITE CD EVER!!,IT IS THE BEST! IT IS AWESOME! A GREAT PARTY CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,BOOOOOOOOO,"This CD stinks. It's got the worst music. The only good song is ""This is How We Do It"".Don't buy it."
4,"An eclectic collection, but overall it's pretty fun!","This is a collection of the kind of songs you might hear at a ball game...any sort of ball game. It's an eclectic collection, a hodge-podge of this and that, but overall it's pretty fun!"
2,Stick to LIVING LIKE HUSTLERS.,"Time has revealed that this album is not very good. Above The Law had one good album in them, this is not it."
4,Adaptability,"One of the ""selling"" points of the Russian martial art of Systema is the ease at which its concepts are applied to the most unusual circumstances. Fighting in the Water is one example of that adaptability. Using many of the same drills centered on breathing, relaxation, movement, and form (posture), these fighting instructors give you the tools you need to survive a fight in the water. Following these drills, you will learn how to become as comfortable in water as out of it. Whether you have an irrational fear of water or you take to it like a duck, you will find something for you in these lessons. In addition to instructive, these drills are just plain fun. Watch the video with friends, then get out there in the lake and have some fun trying them out. Use common sense rules as with any new exercise activity, of course. But most of all, enjoy the training and get over that uneasy feeling in the water and learn a lot while you're at it."
4,jiffypop,"I like the quiet, Caribbean beat on many of these songs. Good quality, long CD that was a good buy. Can't say that about the container. Don't like the cheap, paper box it came in that won't stay closed."
5,On My Short-List of Favorite Books,I'm ordering another copy of MOTHER WITHOUT A MASK because I lent my Hard Back copy to someone who never returned it. I wish more people could read this book because I think they would have a whole new attitude toward those who are living life styles very different from our own. I found the book entertaining as well as educational.Mrs Holton is a wonderful story teller.
3,OK but Oddly Titled,"This is a strangely titled DVD, given that some of the women are never shown from the back and at least one is never even shown from the waist down, which sort of gives credence to Mystique's fly-by-night reputation. They try to be classy but seldom raise themselves above B- or C-class productions like this. At least the segments are relatively short and to the point; there's only so much slo-mo footage of a woman running her hands over her body before one is tempted to hit the fast-forward button. If you're interested in this kind of thing, I'd at least recommend that you get it discounted or used."
3,Not bad,"The town of Goulden's Falls, long sunken beneath the surface of a man-made lake, harbors a terrible secret. As the fiftieth anniversary of the dam approaches, the forgotten horror awakens, drawing two independent journalists into its orbit.This is one of those cheap paperback originals with garish covers that there seemed to be so many of in the 80s. Largely forgotten, they now gather dust on the shelves of used book stores if they still exist at all. This novel actually succeeds as an efficient, effective little thriller for much of its length. By the end, however, it becomes clear that author Matthew J. Costello has no way to end it other than by falling back on the hoariest of B-movie cliches. Until that point, though, it evokes some pretty good shudders, particularly in scenes wherein divers explore the submerged town."
3,great documentary,"The documentary was great, very complete, but the DVD disc was awful, the disc was not a original disc, the front was just a paper glued on the disc, the box was fine and the quality of video fine too."
5,almost as good as...,"this is a risky move for young sufjan-following up his best received record to date with a collection of outtakes. only a guy batty enough to think about recording an album for each of the 50 states could be so stupid. but wait a second! holy cow, i guess he knows what he's doing. this release is awesome. it clearly would have been criminal NOT to put this out. my only complaint about this disc is this inclusion of three different versions of ""chicago"" and this is even mitigated by it's not being a proper addition to his catalog. give him a mulligan there. as already stated, it sounds exactly like illinois and this is a good thing. given mr. stevens' penchant for evolving, it may be our last chance to enjoy that unique blend that made illinois the best record of this decade (so far).odd thing is, this may actually outsell its big sister. i hope so. sufjan deserves the money. give it to him."
4,Take Me to Chicago,"Sufjan's lyrics are rich, specific, emotive, honest and poetic. Tracks that particularly transport me so the music takes over whatever I was doing at the time include the acoustic version of ""Chicago,"" ""Saul Bellow,"" and ""Pittsfield."""
3,Stevens a new American Master,"I do think that this young man will be considered one of the best song writers of the 21st Century.His songs are in the same league as Woody Guthre.This CD has some songs that ""miss"", but most of them are right on the mark.Too bad the Illinoiose CD was not the double set as intended."
3,Tiding listeners over until the next album....,"This is certainly an interesting collection, and has a few standout pieces.I'm really eager to see his next work. I think Sufjan is immensely talented, and has an enormous amount of promise as a long-term artist. Having said that, he does have a few weaknesses in his repetoire - a preponderance to ramble musically, and a certain sameness in the sonic elements. I don't want him to lose his sense of adventure and whimsy, but unchecked, the hey-look-I'm-hitting-a-tin-can-with-a-stick earnestness can be a bit much.But ""Illinois"" was a classic CD that deserved every accolade it's received - a wonderful culmination of much of his previous experimentation. This isn't a full-on followup, but it it probably going to delight hardcore Sufjan fanatics."
4,X-cellent,"I don't really think of this as an X-games sampler, as much as I do just a great early 90's alt/metal collection. It's pretty lengthy at 17 tracks, and includes alt/metal classics from Primus, Ministry, Pepper's, Beastie's, Korn, Kravitz, Faith no More, and a great House of Pain remix. The remaining stuff is all mostly good too. Volume 3 isn't bad either with Pantera, 311, and Crystal Method, but it's not as sweet as this is. So if your throwing a party with all your little X buddies, and they're at least over 19, this should be the only cd you need."
5,oil is correlated with the recent growth of islam,"a tour de force. this title is one of Pipes' early works when he was preaching about the ""comimg storm"" but no one in DC would listen."
5,more essential early Fahey,"""The Yellow Princess"" has a lot in common with Fahey's other early stuff, especially ""Death Chants, Breakdown, and Military Waltzes."" Similar inspired mix of full-on fingerpicking, slow blues, dissonance and found sound. The title track can be found on a number of anthologies, but the rest of the record is excellent as well. There's drum and bass backing on a few cuts, an unusual set-up for Fahey but one that works well.Suprising this is only available as an import, according to Amazon. You'd think Vanguard would get with the program and reissue this excellent CD, especially now that he's kicked the bucket. Let's hope so."
5,Darkly Humorous Revenge,"Picador edition has wonderful, nicely written introduction that gives marvelous details of Saki's remarkable and short life, explaining well why his stories are usually so dark, and why he liked to take aim at stuffy old bats.Nearly all of Saki's short stories are about some character exacting revenge upon cruel or shallow members of the British upper class. His writing sometimes feels labored and overwrought, with overlong sentences or ungainly descriptions. But his consistant style, sense of justice, and biting wit are the gems to be discovered within.The earliest stories seemed to have a lack of balance between darkness and wit, but he did find his equilibrium and most of the later tales are deliciously satisfying.Absolutely delightful reading if you liked Robert Altman's recent film Gosford Park, or if you are fed up with stuffy, mean upper class types."
2,BEWARE! This is the MONO mix.,"This was an early 1957 stereo Roulette recording and one of Basie's best albums. Capitol/Blue Note elected to remaster this masterpiece in mono, instead of using the stereo master. They should be ashamed to release this wonderful album in this form. The stereo version is amazing. If you can find a used copy the first mid 80's CD issue of this on French Vogue (which is in stereo) grab it! (try Amazon France) The only reason I don't give this domestic reissue just one star is that it does contain some alternate and out takes. Not everyone is into the ""back to mono"" movement."
1,How much???!!!,"It's 11 tracks, lasts 29 and one-quarter minutes (according to the ""and more bears"" website) and you're asking $950 US?As an incredulous Aussie might say ""Crikey mate! Emma Chizit?"""
3,Somewhat of a disappointment,I really like Basie but many of the tunes here are on the dull side. It's a good version of Lil Darling and Whirybird. There are better Basie CDs out there
1,EX-CUSE ME???!!!,"$950.00. Is that a typo? For not quite 1/2 hour of music? And $1 free download? This should at the very LEAST be a solid platinum CD that can cook breakfast and provide day-care for the kids! Anything less is RipOffsVille, ladies and gents!"
1,Wow,"Did you notice that if you buy it for $950, then you get $1 in free amazaon downloads? What a bargain."
4,"not the early Basie, but really good","Of course this is not the ground-breaking band that featured Lester Young and the Basie rhythm section in the late 30s, but it's a great band, with more power and drive than that band, and just as much swing. Did I really say that? The power comes from abigger band and better recording techniques. Lockjaw Davis's presence is wonderful. Whirlybird and Flight of the Foobirds are super cuts. This is NOT the first Basie disk you should buy, but it is about #6, and since #1-4 (the three disk set of Basie on Decca and Vols. 1,2,3 on Columbia) are in my top 10 jazz disks overall, this is a high recommendation. The Best of Jazz issue of Basie is superb by the way, if you only want to buy one."
5,Basie's Best Band with Signature Songs,"Having heard Count Basie and His Orchestra innumerable times in many venues across the country, the Complete Atomic Basie would have to be my favorite CD since it features what I would personally consider to be his best band. ""Kid from Red Bank"", ""Whirlybird"", and the smooth ""Lil' Darlin'"" are superb demonstrations of the range of this entourage.Many will remember the tune ""Blues in Hoss' Flat"" as the number featured in Jerry Lewis' movie ""The Errand Boy"". In that movie Lewis pretends he is a big shot giving orders to imaginary underlings in a corporate board room. The piece provides the drive behind Lewis' great enactment. The movie is worth renting for that scene alone.The quality of the remastering on this CD is also quite good."
2,hokey,"I read this one for a book club - so it isn't my usual fare. This is a little bit more hard-boiled, first in the series, featuring Hoke Mosely, a detective in Miami. Hoke smokes, drinks, swears, and eats whatever he wants (teeth or no teeth), so this obviously takes place in an earlier decade. Hoke starts out investigating the death of a Hare Krishna at the International Airport, and winds up losing more things than one can count as well as connecting his investigation to a lot of odd twists and turns in the story. Humor definitely plays a part - a large part - but it was a tad to masculine for my taste."
1,PLEASE Don't Bother,"This was so bad I barely got through it. I can't understand the high praise from other reviewers. This wasn't a thriller or in the least bit funny. Hoke Moseley lives in a dump hotel because he has to send his ex-wife every other paycheck and can't afford anything else. This veteran Miami cop manages to get his teeth, badge & gun stolen when he stupidly sticks his head out his hotel room door without knowing who it is and gets beat up. The whole book just reenforced what a loser he was."
5,THE BEST GREATEST FREESTYLE ON EARTH!,WHEN I BOUGHT THE COLLECTION 1 TO 10 IT WAS LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE. CAUSE I USE TO HAVE THEM A RECORDED ON A CASSETTE.
3,I would pass on this one,"A decent assortment of song's but not with any length.The earlier volume's in this series are a better choice. It takes time to find what to like because there are so many different choices.Be patient and read the reviews because we all do and try and reach out to help one another in explaining as best we could . Everyone has their own all time favorite's,lol.Happy Dancing.Bye"
4,this cd is a must for all the 90-94 crowd,"Remember the day's partying with your crew, all the homies getting together and going to the house partie's. Yeah those were the day's I wish I could be 15 again. Johnny-O bring's back the memories."
5,They Don't Make Singers Like This No Mo',"Soulful ain't even the word. Classic R & B comes close to describing this album, but still doesn't even give it justice. This is an album that demands your complete awe. I have tried cooking while it is playing and nearly burned my entire arm. You just sit and listen. And catch the holy ghost. Shoot, if any preacher wants to increase his church's roll, let him put on ""Come Ye Disconsalate"". Sinners, saints alike will be coming through the doors in droves. And for all you little kids under 30 who thought Luther Vandross was the first to record ""I Who Have Nothing"" listen to Roberta and Donny's ORIGINAL version. Be prepared to cringe in agony the next time you hear Luther's version on the radio. And we ain't gon even talk about ""For All We Know."" I can only imagine how many babies were conceived to that one. Shoot, I probably was.GET THIS ALBUM IMMEDIATELY!"
5,"""Where Is The Love?""....RIGHT HERE","Originally, my dad bought this album in 1972. I've borrowed the album, kept it and worn it out; bought the cassette and wore it out; finally I have the CD. I've loved this album from the moment I heard ""Where Is The Love"" on the radio, to then listening to the album after my dad bought it. And he didn't buy many albums, so by that fact alone, I knew it was special. This is a classic album, showcasing two exceptional vocalists/instrumentalists. Both Roberta and Donny's vocals are warm and inviting on ""You've Got A Friend,"" and ""When Love Has Grown,"" playful on ""Baby I Love You,"" and so earnest on ""You've Lost That Loving Feeling."" This album is a classic, and is an example of the great R&B albums of the decade."
2,The 70's,"I bought this CD because of one song on it: ""Where is the Love?"". This was a great song from this 70's and they don't play it enough on the 70's stations I listen to (on Satellite Radio and on Yahoo! Music). The rest of the CD bored me. But the price was right!"
3,good music but they both have done better work,I WAS NOT HAS ENAMORED WITH THIS EFFORT BY THESE TWO ARTISTS.I HAVE HEARD BETTER COMING FROM THESE VERY PROLIFIC SONGWRITERS/SINGERS. I'D SAY 50% WAS GOOD 25% MEDIOCRE AND 25% NOT SO GOODASIDE FROM THE MATERIAL THEIR VOICES WERE NEVER BETTER.
5,I love this album.,"I've loved this album (now CD) since it first came out. After all of these years, it continues to be a beautiful and moving collection of music. Any- one who loves soulful R&B must have this in their collection."
3,An OK album,Somehow I expected more from this album but it didn't deliver. Perhaps for the diehard Donny Hathaway fan it would've suited but I'm afraid it didn't do much for me...
1,Horrible,"If you want to get extremely frustrated then get this product. Also, if you want to have nothing fixed on your computer get this product. I wish I could return it."
1,Live Updates,"On 12-7-03, cynicalodessit from Woodbury, MN United States, wrote:...""keep the 2003 version and just sign up for new virus definitions."" How does one ""just sign up for new virus definitions."" I already have SystemsWorks 2003. TIA!"
2,B Smith,"Crashed my hard drive when I tried to update from System works 2002. Deleted important files needed to boot windows. BACKUP YOUR HARD DRIVE BEFORE INSTALLING, or you will be pissed off like me. No help from the techies at Symantec either.Once I was able to resurect, it seems to be working great though."
1,"Run, run, run as fast as you can","I have always like Norton products, but this one is horrible. I am taking a break after a 6 hour install process on this garbage, and I'm not even done yet. I had 2003, 2002, ... and this one won't install without constant errors. I can't even get it uninstalled off my system to have a clean boot up.Forget about viruses, worms, hackers etc, this is one and you have even paid for this garbage."
1,Installation fails and doesn't clean up,"The installation keeps failing, and then it doesn't clean itself up - it leaves you with the Symantec Core Licence Client service running, and if you delete that you will trash your network connection and then you'll need to reload XP."
1,Norton CrashWorks,"This beast of a program caused a blue-screen crash shortly after I installed it on my XP system. Now I get ""serious error"" messages every time I boot up my computer.I should have listened to the warnings on here...Year after year Norton puts out this kind of clumsy software...they never get it right...I don't expect they ever will.Never again, Norton."
1,Keep the 2003 version instead!!!,"If you have the 2003 version you need to keep it, it is a wonderful product, and I wish I still had mine. Whatever you do, DO NOT UPGRADE to this 2004 version! Buy the subscription and save yourself many headaches. These other people know what they are talking about. Now I'm looking at re-formating my hard drive or buying a new one to get rid of my pain."
2,Don't bother,"I am generally a big fan of Norton products, but if you have Norton SystemWorks 2003, then you have almost everything that the 2004 version has. I loaded the 2004 version and checked it out, the differences are pretty minor.Also, when I loaded the 2004 version on my computer it disabled my internet access somehow(Earthlink). It kept giving me warnings that I should run ""LiveUpdate"", but I couldn't because I couldn't get onto the internet. After I uninstalled it my internet access went back to working like normal.I'll stick with the 2003 version. I've never had any problems with it."
1,The Final Straw,"Adding product activation was the straw that broke this camel's back. I have used Norton Utilities since DOS and have continued up through Systemworks 2003. Well, the latest version went back to the store. Aside from a myriad of problems, the reality here is Symantec is just not a customer-friendly company. Look elsewhere. Some good alternatives:Anti-Virus: Pc-Cillin 2003 from Trend-Micro (If you have IMAP e-mail you will have to disable POP3 e-mail scanning) otherwise a great package!Disk Defrag: Diskeeper 8.0 is the best.General fix-it utilities: Nothing really jumps out. Hopefully a product will come on the market that really works well. I haven't found one yet."
1,A poor upgrade to a good product,"I have been running SystemWorks for years, and Personal Firewall for 1 year, didnt have a day's problem with the 2003 bundle on 98 or XP, but nothing but problems with 2004 bundle (NSW+PF).First activation didnt work, now its conflicting with something else, causing it not to run at all, although no obvious error message. Rebooted without other drivers..no joy. Support an absolute nightmare, despite forking out $30 a pop.Steer clear of this one, folks."
1,Customer Support Lacking,Just tried to load this program unsucessfully. Attempted online tech support and received email that I would get a response in FOUR TO FIVE DAYS! I switched from McAfee after my subscription expired and will be returning Norton and going back to McAfee who has a free Chat Support where I can solve my problems immediately- who wants to wait 4 or 5 days to solve a problem?
3,2004 Norton Systemworks,This is exactly what I wanted. It was a good thing that my son had good eyes otherwise I wouldn't have been able to read the product key. I use it for password manager and I love it.
1,"A slow, memory-hogging, suite that's a rip-off!!","Other than the anti-virus stuff, everything else is just MASSIVE dead weight. You'd think something this massive would offer a firewall program. If Symantec did that, then the price could be justified. But they (Surprise!! Surprise!!) force you to buy that seperately. In short, the time for this software suite has passed a LONG time ago!! You're better off getting Norton Internet Security, which is bundled with Norton AntiVirus and Norton AntiSpam (Add in Executive Software's Diskeeper, and you'll have all you'll need.) Don't bother wasting your money on Norton SystemWorks. It's a freakin' rip-off!! Everything else can be taken care of by the Windows OS."
3,Support? What's that? And how to SHORTEN your subscription!,"Overall, it's a decent product. However, the phone support disconnected me 3 times and my emails have gone unanswered for 2 months! I upgraded from a previous version - which I installed 6 months ago. I THOUGHT the upgrade would extend my previous subscription to get upgrades and virus definitions. Instead, it gave me one year from the date of the upgrade. So I lost 6 months of subscription time!While AntiVirus appears to work, my computer (WinXP, P4 2.6GHz, 512MB Ram) has slowed significantly since upgrading. And that's AFTER I ran speed disk, web doctor, etc. And no, I have not installed anything else. I'm considering uninstalling and reinstalling, although from other reviews that seems like a risk in itself."
1,Norton is the Anti-Christ,Don't buy this software. I tried to uninstall Norton Anti-virusfrom my system before install of NSW 2004 but it insists that aversion of anti-virus is still there and will not install.Installation locks up EVERY time . Save yourself anguish byanything else ... O no Nada tech support until u cough up30 bucks.... Unless u are a programmer and feel like editingyour registry
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I've been buying norton for years. Since it first came out actually. And I wasted money on this product. I install it only to find out that they want you to activate it every time it runs. It won't work otherwise. And it's not returnable. Once you buy software, you can't give it back. So I'm stuck with a copy of Norton that will not work. Thanks Symantec. See if I ever buy anything from you again..."
1,Weak,"Ok, so I didn't read and obey the reviews for this product but I thought I had enough experience with Norton products to make it work. It doesn't. Save your money. While I didn't have the problems with installation that others have had, I find that the software does very little to aid in helping my computer to run better.Of special note is clean sweep. When you run it MANY programs say that they are protected and cannot be deleted. What is up with that? I paid my money for this product, now get the stuff out of my computer that I tell you to. It really doesn't work. A specific example is Netscape. Netscape has infested my computer and I have tried to delete it through add and remove programs but my Sony (AKA shotty) won't let me delete it. So I thought Norton would go in an tear it out. No way. Norton doesn't do anything you cannot do yourself. Do yourself a favor, skip the Norton and buy premium beer instead!"
2,problems ...,"I've had Systemworks for the past 3 years ... but this was by far the worst experience ... too many problems, i.e can' find a qdcspi.dll - that was supposed to be fixed in the 2001 release ... ??? I've begun experiencing problems with IE sessions ... I use Win ME which is far from being a reliable OS but I know that I haven't had those problems before ... As other people have suggested here ... keep the 2003 version and just sign up for new virus definitions."
2,They Ruined GoBACK,"One of the best parts of this suite, should have been GoBack whcy Norton acquired from Roxio last year. I couldn't believe that the new version took out functionality that was there in Version 3.0 -- the ability to retrieve files which disapeared after reverting the hard drive. WHY???The Antivirus is excellent as usual with Norton. The scheduling doesn't seem to pay attention to your settings. Set what you will, the program still wants to run a couple of times a week, and new a check up.If they enhanced rather than degraded GoBack (suggestions: Allow larger than 4 GB file and run restore the ability to retrieve lost files after a revert), they could do away with a few other utilities in the suite."
2,Not worth paying for,"I bought this new version because I got it for free after rebates. One button check-up will no longer automatically repair any errors it finds, if you spend anytime on a website with a form to be filled (ie cnnsi) the password manager (NPM) pops up, steals the focus and asks if you would like to complete the form. I have found one site that NPM does not even work! NPM seems to put your entire phone number in the box for area code. Unless you get it for a low, low price after rebate, keep the 2003 version and get the google tool bar, it will fill out forms and block the annoying pop-ups."
2,Don't use with older CPU,"As a user of other Norton product don't attempt to install Systemworks on an older CPU. The minimum requirements for a computer running Win 2000 is a 133mhz processor and 64mb of ram. I have a 400mhz processor and 521mb of ram. The machine was crippled, startup was 7-10 minutes, opening a program took an additional 1-3 minutes and the virus check would cripple the web browser waiting for every file to be scanned. All was solved by uninstalling the product. Overall it may do the trick at fixing computer problems such as lost files, viruses, windows registry problems, and such. If you have any of these except for the virus problem install, fix it, and uninstall because you will have more problems then you started out with."
1,"If you own 2003, don't bother","I've been using Norton Utilities, now called Systemworks, since they came on 5 1/2 inch floppies. Back in the ""old"" days, Norton would release a new version that contained better or additional features. Unfortunately, Symantec now insists on releasing one every year, regardless of any major changes. Too bad."
2,Internet access problems,"For some reason this program disables Earthlink Total Access internet access. I discovered that the problem is with the way the program loads. If you don't include it in the startup, everything works fine. The problem seems to be with the Clean Sweep and Ghost."
1,Really I classify SystemWorks with no stars at all,"The term ""Easy"" in the ads really means uncontrollable - just like the OS called MS Windows. They offer no support - ooops, they do support you for 40 bucks - my word that's the same as this software costs!? So you buy it once and then over and over again, until you throw it away. Then happiness sets in. Working behind the scenes, SystemWorks ruined two of my Laptops used for important work (while I was in Europe) but did I understand, NO. I thought it was a Virus, but Virus Scans were negative and it turned out to be SystemWorks. Actually - I call it SystemDoesn'tWorks. Easy my foot! If you have a problem during installation, give up fast. I spent days on this but, since there are no options (to make it EASY to use there are no options or controls) once it decides not to allow installation, there is no appeal process and no support from Norton. You just can't ""force installation"""
1,Buyer beware!,"This product is absolutely horrible. I bought five update copies for my office since I was very happy with the previous version. I have had nothing but trouble and can't get help! Worse, when you need technical support, they will CHARGE YOU unless you ask your question by email. Then, you get a lame response from an offshore support operation. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this!!"
1,fails to back up hard drive,"I have used Norton systemmworks to keep my hard drive operating. I backed up my hard drive 3 times with Ghost but when I needed to restore the hard drive, each of the ghost images failed with an error 437. There was no warning that the images might not be able to restore the hard drive and once you begin to restore the image, the hard drive is wiped clean. AVOID THIS PRODUCT. AVOID THE GHOST BACKUPS."
1,Problems !,"NSW 2004 Disabled my Earthlink Total Access. After a week of having to do a quick restore on my Windows 98, my computer sloooowing way down, improper shutdowns, freezing screens, etc. etc., I seemed to get it all working. But what an unnecessary load of grief!!! I un-installed NSW 2004 then re-installed with a custom installation leaving out the Password Manager. This may have been the problem. My internet access was functioning again after I did this. I will probably be a lot more careful before choosing a product and read reviews, be aware of return policies. I jumped the gun on this one. Norton got the best of me this time, but there won't be a next. I will be watching out for a better product/company."
1,NIS 2004 Pro,"I have NIS on 3 PCs and one Mac. All installed and worked fine. Had an opportunity to buy NIS 2004 Pro cheap (after rebates) the big shopping day after Thanksgiving. Spent two days trying to install 2004 Pro on a newer Dell running XP. I do know how to clean out the old stuff. Spent 30 minutes on telephone with Symantec IT who led me thru 20 reconfigure steps for my puter. Never did work.. Talked to local IT rep who says Symantec ""Microsofted"" the buyers. Product full of crap. Removed all 2004 and reinstalled NIS 2003 without a hitch. Anyone want to buy 2 copies of NIS 2004 Pro cheap?"
1,2004 forced me to reinstall OS,"I've used Norton Systemworks for years so well acquainted with installation process. It hung up on the opening screen when ""next"" button wouldn't work. I was unable to find a phone number for tech/installation services. I could still access the Internet but java script errors prevented loading some sites. Then I discovered major problems with my OS (XP Home). This involved 6 to 8 hours on phone with Dell (at least they were accessible) and finally reinstalling my entire operating (we tried a repair first)system. Now I am having to reinstall all programs and backups but you can be sure Norton Systemworks wouldn't be one of them. I finally got a response from Norton's registration department (only e-mail address I could find) which suggested I run the program from safe mode. NO THANK YOU!"
4,Works great with XP,"A lot of the new features are related to the Windows XP environment. Maybe they don't work so well under older versions. Under XP Pro I have had seamless installation, and the utilities have unscrambled many messes done with installs and uninstalls."
1,Boom to Bust in 3 Versions or Less!,"In years past, I would never run a Mac or PC system without Norton Utilities or SystemWorks. Things started looking bad with NSW 2002 and 2003... Very little improvement, higher prices. With NSW 2004, Symantec has effectively killed any reason for anyone to use this now-useless software. If you want hard drive imaging, buy Ghost standalone. If you want anti-virus protection, buy Norton AV standalone. Stay away from NSW. Even if you can manage to get the product activated (I couldn't), it will bog down your system with tons of memory-resident and background applications."
1,look for something else,"Now I bought this suite because I have been using symantec products for past 3 years and have been satisfied with performance. Also for the amounth of utilites in the package it's a good priceWell I don't know who was coding this years version of Anti virus because I'm getting so many issues with outlook xp not being able to connect to pop3 email server. I'm using windows 2K pro and according to Microsoft I have to uninstall and reinstall antivirus program every time this goes down, it wouldn't be a big deal if it happened once a month but it happens at least once a week. It's impossible to get an messages unless it's from someone I know because the anti-virus konks out all the time. The Anitvirus software has turned into a productivity killer for me.Next time I'm reading reviews in Computer Shopper or PCWorld before I but another Symantic product.There's better utility software out there don't make the same mistake I did."
4,Uninstall old stuff first!,"I've not had a problem installing Systemworks, but I do follow recommended steps. Plus, even if it's not recommended, ALWAYS uninstall the old programs, like any antivirus program or previous Systemworks first. Of course, this would mean unplugging or disconnecting your ""always-on"" connection. Too much trouble for some? One person I know complained that his antivirus program ""went nuts"" while he attempted to install Systemworks, and he finally had to reformat to fix the problems he created trying to force installation, then unistallation, etc...Can't comment on GoBack as I use MS System Restore."
1,Non-existant support,"I have been trying for weeks to get presale information on this product and every single email has gone unanswered. This company is only interested in your money, not your satisfaction. Look elsewhere. Check out V Communications (http://www.v-com.com) for similar products and MUCH better support.UPDATE: Nearly a month later, I got a form letter response to one of my emails, referring me to their web site (if the info was on their web site, would I have gone to the trouble of contacting them?). It answered none of the questions I asked. When I replied, I got another copy of the same form letter sent back to me within 10 minutes. None of my other emails have been answered."
1,Evaluation version is miserable already,"Installed evaluation version available from symantecs website. Before installing, it performs a system test and always freezes my machine at about 32000 files.A progress bar is also missing. Scanning takes about 1.5 hours so far, but it won't tell how many files are left to scan."
5,Met all expectations,"Prompt delivery, full support during the whole process.. Recommended..I bought 2 Ford Explorer FOBS- remotes and they work great and saved me 100$+.."
1,Worst of many Gould biographies,"Ostwald obviously was upset that Gould turned away from him. This biography is nothing but a shrinks' analysis after being cast aside and feeling hurt. Compared to other biographies, you can tell that after Ostwald was dumped he has no solid facts about Gould. And much of what he writes is contradicted by other biographers who were working with Gould's close friends, letters, and other documents.This book is a sham, written by a self-absorbed psychiatrist who wanted to make a buck off of his one-time (and short) association with someone famous. Avoid."
4,"well-written and interesting,","full of detail and personal anecdotes about the world-famous eccentric pianist.To correct a minor point of contention: the author was a psychiatrist, NOT a psychologist.I almost gave this a 3 because I wanted more psychology, even if speculative. More, I wanted something said about the relationship of genius to eccentricity and what is widely seen as madness. Good material has been written about this, but not much; Gould would have made a fine study (I mean ""study"" in a personal and subjective way, not as an object under laboratory scrutiny by experts). Instead, the book was really a storybook biography with loads of information about composition dates, performances, etc.Still, it flowed well and I found it helpful and, in places, inspiring."
2,My opinion,"I guess I have to say that I enjoyed the book itself while reading it, since I am such a big fan of Gould but, it just doen't give me any insights on his musical world and Oswalt emphasizes too much about how close they were... Maybe because Oswalt was a doctor, not a musician himself.."
4,Never forget the MUSIC!,"We are interested in Gould not because of his eerie behavior or his being a paranoid. We are JUST fascinated by his wonderful music. This book gives us some perspective of the psychic state and health of Gould, but it stress too much on them ,regardless the really good music Gould had move us, and it tells too little about how Gould make music, what's the connection between music and Gould, and what the meaning of life to Gould? After reading the book, I get the impression that Gould is but a tragic freak. But I ask myself, where does the music come from? The book tells us nothing. It does help me know Gould the guy, but doesn't help me penetrate into Gould the musician."
2,"Interesting perspective, but flawed in many ways.","I had high hopes for this book, reserving a copy the second I heard of its existance. And though it provided some new perspectives, not on new material. I also felt that while he continued to talk about Gould's ego problems, his writing seemed to reflect some of his own ego problems. One cannot forget his contradictory parenthetical statements about Gould's views, and the amount of himself that can be found in a biography about Gould. Overall, it was a good idea, but not necesarily as well implimented"
1,psycho-babble,"This book makes you wonder about the profession of psychology. For example: Glenn Gould calls some of his radio pieces, collages of recorded interviews and conversations, polyphonic. The author alleges that this is evidence Gould is pathologically ""out of touch with reality"" because ""polyphonic"" is a musical term, and music requires pitches. Obviously, Gould is using the term ""polyphonic"" figuratively, but whether or not the term is appropriate should be considered a matter of opinion, not psychological diagnosis. Buy ""The Glenn Gould Reader"" instead. Let Glenn Gould speak for himself.Recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
3,"The author is bitter, and it shows!...","...BUT with Glenn Gould as the subject, it can't possibly be all *that* bad. I think Ostwald is disgruntled at having been ""dumped"" by Gould as a friend, and it shows in this rather nasty account of an astonishingly wonderful person. I feel that this book delves into GG's person too far for comfort and reasonability, to the point of offensiveness. I think Ostwald created an unfair, inaccurate account of Gould's character in order to make excuses for why Gould stopped calling him. Otto Friedrich and Tim Page, in their respective Gould biographies, give a far better picture of both GG *and* his music--and that is what we should care about far more than the personal details Ostwald deals with!"
1,LLOYD ANDERSEN,DONT EVER GO THROUGH THIS COMPANY FIND YOUR ICECREAM SOMEWHERE ELSE.MY WIFE ORDERED WRONG KIND CALLED TO RETURNED AN WAS CALLED A IDIOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE.
5,Deep Space Ambient,"Super cosmic ultra-deep ambient for those meditations that should take you beyond the physical limitations of the human body! Dare yourself to sleep to this album on repeat at a low volume and wake up in that state of cognition that exists wholly disincarnate, yet having learned from the human condition all there is to know of yourself as a post human intelligence...Thank You Dilate!!!"
4,Cyclos,"I really like this cd, relaxing electronic music to spir you on into outer orbits. Shame it's a discontinued item."
3,Don't buy this model,"I've used HP printers for many years from the Laser II. But this time I wasn't paying attention to the design since I didn't understand till I bought the machine that I couldn't feed paper like the older models, that is, you could say take a stack of checks and put them on the manual feeder and pay bills.You can't do that now. You can only manually feed one piece of paper at a time. I guess I'll have to buy the module for a second tier of printing. Note added later: I find that address labels are not precisely and evenly printed.HP-your desire to make profits and squeeze the customers is not appreciated."
4,hp laserjet 1320,"Good work horse printer. I use it daily, printing about 100 sheets a day, first one I owned lasted about 7yrs and then got damaged. I order this as a replacement because I had / have 3 boxes of toner that fit this machine."
5,"Good speed and quality, nice little footprint","I bought this printer to make double-sided printouts of order forms, and I am very pleased with its performance. The print quality is clear and even, the machine is very reliable even though I printed over 25,000 sheets on it the first week.Cons: the paper sometimes gets jammed as it feeds from the tray, and even when you fix the problem and hit the green ""okay"" button to continue printing, it continues to register a problem until you cancel the job and shut down the printer. Also, the initial toner cartridge does not last very long, it's only good for about 1,000 sheets. The extended life toner cartridges are much better but are pricey at $130 each.Overall a good machine and worth the money, the double-sided printing feature is a very nice bonus."
5,Long-lasting printer,"I have had this printer since 2006. The biggest expense, as for most laser printers, has not been the initial purchase price but the toner, drum and paper refills. It gives a decent-quality darkness on the page, and has only jammed twice in 7 years. I don't use it nearly as much these days as I did years ago, and it will probably last indefinitely."
5,How Can It Be Better?!,"Just a really fine item!Had for six years, hundreds of pages a month, and never a problem! Quiet, truly reliable fast machine!The best office printer for black and white. And cartridges last for six to eight months depending on how much you pull it out and rock it back and forth! Give it an A++!"
4,Regarding the duplex option,"This is just a quick comment rather than a full review.Printing in duplex mode (both sides) takes more than double the time of single sided printing. The sheets do not come out printed on both sides. Instead, sheets come out initially printed on one side, but right before a sheet is released in the output tray, it is ""retracted"" back inside the printer to print the back side then it is completely ejected printed both sides. So the sequence is: out-in-out which takes close to 2.5 times single sided printing.At least, all this process is done automatically versus printers where you have to print odd pages first, re-insert them in the paper tray, then print the even pages in reverse order."
1,No duplex printing with Windows 7,"I bought this printer because it offered duplex printing (printing on both sides of the page). This feature worked perfectly under Windows XP Pro and Vista, but it doesn't work under Windows 7. There are a number of complaints about this problem on HP's customer forum but so far the company has chosen to ignore them. If you are running Windows 7 or planning to in the future, it would be wise purchase another printer. The only lesson I have learned from the time I've wasted searching for a solution to this problem is that my next printer purchase will not be from HP."
2,Mediocre at best,"Okay for printing on 8.5 x 11 paper. Standard input tray does not work for paper narrower than 8.75 inches wide. Paper guides on multipurpose input slot do not stay put, making it very difficult to print straight on other sizes of paper."
3,Better for only a couple of users,"The price was great on this printer and it shipped right away. I was intending to use it for my whole office, but that plan didn't work as well as I wanted it to. I felt like I was replacing toner too often and the print, with a little rubbing, flaked off. Later I purchased a HP LJ 5200 and saw a vast improvement. It is a much more expensive machine, but I am sure that the toner we save will pay for the difference. Now we use the 1320 for just a few personal computers and it works perfectly."
1,A lung's worst nightmare,I just read some articles about the particle emission of the laser printer. This machine is one of the worst kind. You need to make sure that you also buy a laser printer filter if you really like this model!
4,great printer -- but don't forget to get a USB cable too,"This printer is fast, and its duplex printing is a great feature -- it can print on both sides of the paper automatically, without your having to feed the paper in. It also has a neat booklet printing feature, so you can print your own books. The only drawback: HP is too cheap to include a USB cable with the printer, so you have to buy it yourself. The only things in the box are the printer, an electric cable, and the CD to install the software and view the manual. Still, it's a great printer at a good price."
2,Laserjet 1320,"The printer is good, but it came with NOTHING ELSE. How do you expect me to hook it up or even begin to find cables?? Not very happy with this."
4,Very pleased with product.,"When I first received the printer I had realized that I ordered the wrong one. I wanted a color printer not a black and white printer. So after several phone calls and emails to the company that shipped it about a receipt,manual and how to exchange it for what I really wanted all of which was to no avail. I decided to try the printer out and to make a long story short I really did not needed a color printer so I decided to keep it and glad I did. The quality of print is very good Would like to know how to print post cards and such but I will figure it out."
1,Not network and double-side,"I bought this printer because under the product description (#8 to be exact) says that it is a wireless printer with easy networking AND that it prints double-sided pages. I received the printer only to discover that it does neither. I have windows 7, and I figured out how to properly install the printer but there was no function for a wireless connection. I don not understand why this printer is listed as wireless, it is not!"
4,Worth the effort to find it.,Insightful and introspective account of the author's extended study of the Polar Innuit of the Thule district in Greenland. The most recent edition includes the author's bittersweet reflections many years later on modern incursions that threaten the survival of this indigenous culture.
1,Looks may be deceiving... AVOID this unreliable player,"I agree that the player looks and sounds nice, but it fails on the reliability factor. I've had this player in for servicing three times in less than a year. After about 3 months of play all my CDs began skipping. I get it fixed and a few months later, all my CDs are skipping again. The player is very UNRELIABLE. I was warned that lot's of moving parts = more chances of player failure. This is definitely the case here. The CD changer involves many mechanical moving parts. I should have listened to the warnings. This is a player to definitely AVOID! Unless of course you enjoy spending alot of time at the repair shops."
1,A Place in Time - Mike Gibbins,Just a warning to anyone looking for the theme song to the 4400.THIS IS NOT IT!!!! This CD has nothing in common with the 4400 except for the title. I was forced to give it 1 star so that it could be seen.
3,Welcome return from former Badfinger drummer & vocalist,"Out of the limelight for more than a decade, Mike Gibbins returns with a fine album. At its best this album recalls some of Gibbins best work with Badfinger. He's matured both as a songwriter and singer and displays a more adventurous side on this album.To expect Gibbins (or Molland for that matter)to recapture the flame that burned during their days with Badfinger is a little unrealistic. Judged on its own merits this fine album is a worthwhile addition to any fan's collection."
3,Solid Debut!,"A Place In Time is Mike Gibbins First solo album. Mike can write real good songs ; he wrote a handful of great songs for Badfinger. This album has several examples of good songwriting too. Songs like Layaway (written to Pete Ham), Time In, Day After Night all have strong melodies.But - in spite of many good songs the album somehow lacks excitement. Some of the tracks go on for too long;The sound is pretty much the same on many of the tracks, not enough variation. Mike's singing and playing is good, though, so the album is well worth going for. Play half of it at the time, then it's fine.A remastered version has been released containing two bonus-tracks; Believe Me and Bahamas .My favourites:Time In and Day After Night"
5,Duende,". . . I first read the three plays back in the mid-1960's . . . Eventually the book was lost. About 1 year ago I began doing research for some poema I had written circa 1970 and came across Carlos Saura's ""Blood Wedding"" (video) and Jose Menese, which in turn led to Federico Garcia-Lorca and my missing copy of ""3 Tragedies"". I'm rebuilding a library that was destroyed by a fire, and having this English translation as a resource is like having an old friend return . . . I enjoy reading Lorca's work, and comparing translations, so the book is a blessing."
1,"""Blood Wedding"" - Amateurishly written.","""Three Tragedies"" - I only read ""Blood Wedding."" This play was absolutely horrendous. The writing style was rough and detached. Lorca tried writing passionately and seductively, but it came across as illiterate. The characters did not have any depth. Horrible play. I do not recommend."
3,Ok but not great..,"This may be a good book if one wants to build a trading system starting from writing the code with a language such as C++. Especially given the fact that one can order the software from the author.The book also examines some of the most common trading strategies. However, having reviewed other books on this topic and given the title describes the book as an 'Encyclopedia of Trading Strategies"", it would be a useful book but not all-encompassing as one may hope.Overall a useful book, particularly for programmers. As a book on trading strategies it does give some valuable insights but other books on the topic come first..2 stars"
4,Interesting trading models and exit strategies,"Mostly testing of trading models in C or C++. then testing of exit strategies. Well organized and easy to read, interesting even if you are not interested in optimizing.Too much talk about slippage which he should point out that this is a problem for day traders that could be solved by automated trading platform and its not for everybody to worry about that much. Then talks also about gunning, as the name implies."
1,none would work,"the book is too diversified to be useful.if it works, one is enough; more do not do any good.the authors are good at publishing, and seem live on that."
2,Deceiving name,"As a software engineer I needed a book that will teach me some trading strategies that I can program and bought this book hoping to find a list/ideas of trading strategies, as you expect from Encyclopedia. Unfortunately this is the most not practical book I have ever read, if you think you'll be able to trade after reading this book you're wrong!It has academic theoretical discussions about trading systems by testing the most simple and basic setups just to tell you that they don't work if you trade them automatically (crossing MAs, breakouts etc). I'm sorry but you don't need to have Phd to know that, they don't even try to come up with a strategy that work!Who can benefit from this book? If you are in your Master/Phd studies and looking for theoretical trading academic book, no doubt this is for you, all the rest try something else..."
2,Good but outdated,"This book needs a complete overhaul.Markets have changed, tactics have changed and the whole internet and technology boom has had a tremendous effect on markets. There are other books on trading strategy that are more current, and ones that focus on specific markets...such as stocks or currencies. You would be better off with something updated. Generally, from a 'big picture' point of view the book still holds up...but you can find general big picture info at the numerous websites offering free education and lessons.A new, up to date, well tested and proven version of this is needed."
2,Too Technical for Me,"The Encyclopedia of Trading Strategies is well written and is a good book if you are looking for something very technical and mechanical. I was disappointed with the book. I thought it would offer chart set ups or set ups per technical indicators. Instead, it offered codes, etc for setting up mechanical systems."
4,good for travel,These works well if you travel a lot and don't want to bring a big box of bags and or have them all over the bag.
2,No Scent,"The product arrived quickly but, the baggies were not scented and that was a disappointment. The packaging that they are in is a convienant way to have them because its perfect for travel."
5,Excellent information for your last journey,"My husband and I received this book from Pat Cochrane who had asked permission to use one of his poems called ""Conections"" in her book. He asked for a copy of her book in return for using the poem. It came at a most appropriate time: Phil has Parkinson's Disease and we have been discussing the end of life. Pat has clearly, matter-of- factly, intelligently set out the steps one needs to take to ensure that one's affairs are in order before your time is come - complete with all the necessary forms to fill out right in the book, including your epitaph and your obituary. An invaluable asset for all who wish to save their family unnecessary anguish.b"
5,great way to structure conversation,This book is a gteat guide to structure conversation with loved ones about how THEY want us to be prepared for their death. I am starting to use the guidelines and forms to help ME figure out what I want. Many of my forty something friends are buying this book for their spouses AND their parents.
2,"Buddhist Pilgrimage Sites, + Animated Biography","This DVD contains color footage of all of the pilgrimage sites where the Buddha taught and lived 2,500 years ago, not much of which historical building structures remain today, aside from brick architectural foundations which at least provide an outline of the size and layout of the original buildings and building complexes (e.g., palaces, monasteries, and devotional sites and shrines, typically in park-like settings).This DVD also contains an animated biography of the Buddha, in a presentation format which is probably more attractive and interesting to children than to adults.This DVD is 47 minutes long. However, PBS has another, absolutely marvelous 2 hour DVD entitled THE BUDDHA, which contains not only some more compelling animated visual material, but also wonderful and informative commentary by delightful and radiant scholars who explicate - and who also seem to personally embody and exemplify - the Buddha's teachings."
5,Very smooth.,"It doesn't get any smoother than this. Both artists are at their peak career wise. I recall my father purchasing this one on vinyl in 1963.Eckstine's version of ""Don't Cry Baby"" is exquisite. ""Jelly, Jelly"" has the type of feel that youngsters like Michael Buble, Matt Dusk or Harry Connick Jnr. strive to obtain.Tremendous atmosphere on this album and it's on ""Blue Note""..what more could you want?"
5,A Pioneering Aircraft,"The Arado 234 was a pioneering aircraft, combining elements and systems that were themselves new and untested. That this was accomplished at all in the chaos and destruction of wartime Germany makes it all the more remarkable. This book does a good job of covering the basics of the Ar-234A, development of the engines (Jumo and BMW), the airframe and the V-series prototypes up to the first jet reconnaissance missions over London and the Normandy beaches. The photographs are numerous and excellent and the technical drawings are clear and well-done. The Arado 234 is a sparsely-covered subject and cries out for Messers Smith and Creek to give it the full Classic Publications treatment.This is my first review so please be gentle. Hope it helps."
4,"Somewhat Problematic, But a Decent Set of Stories","This may not be the best storybook, and I also agree that the TV series is better, but this really isn't too bad a book.This book is a set of six stories --- ""Fritz Tries Again,"" ""Buried Treasure,"" ""Charles Stands Tall,"" ""Tubbette,"" ""Timothy Takes the Cake,"" ""Laughing on the Inside."" These stories are fairly nicely illustrated and generally fun, funny and interesting, although the dialogue seems a bit unnatural at times and some of the stories are a bit odd.There are some great lessons, such as believing in your potential and not giving up. The songs that the teacher Mrs. Jenkins sings are also cute. But, as has been mentioned, some things just don't work, such as the ""Tubbette"" story, which seems to convey a rather odd message. I don't think the ""Charles Stands Tall"" story is too bad, though. Charles manages to stand up for himself and doesn't let the teasing negatively effect him."
2,Very hard to get to work,"Well, as a Windows application programmer myself, I usually get any new software to work under 15 minutes. I was ""humbled"" by my experience with SystemWorks Pro. It would install fine, but unexpectedly exit right after the startup. No error messages, no warnings, nothing. Symantec knowledge base offered 4 various fix options (one of the most popular articles on the site!), but none of those worked. I guess the problem hit my ""vanity"", so I sat there for the next hour or so until I solved it (basically removal of every trace of any other Symantec product from the XP system). Finally, it worked. Unfortunately, once it started, it knocked-out my Outlook e-mail (""server could not be located""). Turning off e-mail virus checking completely did NOT help the problem. LiveUpdate reported internal errors, so no chance of updating. That did it for me. Uninstalled and things are back to normal. Two stars instead of one because SpeedDisk actually worked."
2,Slowed my system down,"I was very dissapointed with this product. After installing and running SystemWorks, I noticed every application I run on my computer had slowed down considerably. There was constant hard drive activity, even doing somthing as simple as navigating the programs menu under windows. I also noticed my firewall reporting that windows messenger was accessing the internet in the background, which it had never done prior to installing this software(why did it need to do that?). If it didnt slow my system down so much I may have kept using it, but it was to much of a performance hit. I will say on a positive note, it uninstalled nicely.btw, system specs are an AthlonXP 2400, 512 ram, Geforce4 ti4200."
2,Too much burden on system,"This was my third try of the SystemWorks (after 2001 and 2002 versions), and my impression is still the same. It is not worth the hassle of installing and configuring each component and seeing substantial slowing of your machine. I always find it easier to do a fresh installation of Windows a couple of times a year than to suffer with a bogged down machine running SystemWorks. If you are not happy with this product, return it and get your money back."
2,it's ok,"I was dissapointed in the value of this book. A book with this type of content would be better represented in a larger format with better quality printing. The pictures are of the quality of a cheaper art production, and the book seems lacking in content. I have seen much better representations of this subject matter with more artistic imagination and variety. If you are a big fan of this type of work than it should be in your collection but if you are looking for one realy good book to treasure on this subject look some more."
3,A GOOD REFERENCE BOOK,"Although the book is small, it covers much material on the subject and the color reproductions are good for an inexpensive book. The explanations of the reproductions shown are very interesting and very helpful in better understanding the subject matter - the poetry is superb - a valuable reference work for the price."
3,Skin-tight covers,"I usually buy cover-versions of songs because I want to hear someone else's spin (try Type O Negative's ""Summer Breeze"" to hear what I mean) on music. With the notable exceptions of Giez and Supersonic Project, what you have on this CD is just too close to the original. Also, why bother with virtually note-perfect covers of tracks as plodding as 'Exit' or 'Invisible Limits'? Where's the heavy metal version of 'Rising Runner...' or the rave version of 'Midnight in Tula'? As for the 'bonus' tracks, neither is by TD??!!). 'Horizon' is great, but the final track 'Solar Cells' is just horrible: everything that people hate in electronic music."
5,Wonderful Close to a Terrific Series,"The author has stated that he is particularly proud of this work, the last in the Mark Manning mystery series. He should be proud; this is one of his finest efforts to date. If you have followed this series from the first novel (Flight Dreams) as I have, you have no doubt become attached to these characters. Unlike some other authors, Michael successfully wraps up this series for ALL of the characters we've come to know and love through the years.Mr. Craft's wry sense of humor is even more evident in this final installment than in earlier ones, and I daresay you'll find yourself laughing out loud more than a few times. As usual, there is a wonderfully erotic scene or two as well.All in all, fans of the series will find this to be a wonderfully funny, somewhat touching, and altogether satisfying conclusion. Kudos to the author for an absolutely marvelous series--from first book to last!"
5,Brilliant,This is an incredible record. I can't stop listening to it. Better than Rafi's Revenge in the sense that the songs are better and Deeder has matured.
5,Oozes Revolutionary Spirit,"This effort by ADF has resulted in some of the most bottom heavy riddims I have heard. The bass is pulled off flawlessly and the ragga vocals are delivered with such raw energy and genuine passion which makes this album so great. Features the Angry 'Real Great Britain' & 'Officer XX' as well as more melodic 'New Way New Life' and 'Truth Hides', this is the real deal."
4,The echo of a scream!,"Charlie Parker symbolized as no other jazz musician, the existential crisis of a generation. He represented with all the horridness, the embodiment of the sorrow, although he was in the creative decade of the life as the thirties are for any artist.His emblematic talent and his remarkable gifts made of him a legend, and this album includes certainly part of this golden bequeath."
3,Very poor recording,"I have been very impressed with most remastered CD's taken from performances going back to the 50's. Some of this mastering work is nearly miraculous (""Getz and Hamp"" being one shining example). Unfortunately this CD is largely unrestored. It has minimal noise but it also has minimal dynamic range and is quite flat. I admittedly spoiled but I can't get through to the music if I can't hear it propertly. That's a shame because there is some good music here."
3,The Essential Charlie Parker,I was disappointed. I should have listened to the not so positive reviews already on Amazon. There is too much embellished sappy orchestration on this CD and not enough essential Charlie Parker.
5,Sunday in the Park with Bird,"It's October. The leaves are falling. I'm walking in Lincoln Park at sunset. The sky is a brilliant red-orange. I'm holding hands with the girl I love, as we laugh and play like little children. I realize that the moment is perfect.That moment is this CD. I listen to this music and I can't help but imagine myself in that park, in that moment. It's just a wonderful collection of songs."
4,Minor Correction.,"Just to correct a mistake I made, #7 is the song called My Little Suede Shoes w/the Cuban drummers."
1,rebate information is not correct,"Be aware - there is not a $100 rebate for this product. The $35 rebates are identical and you also must provide proof of purchase, or UPCs from each box. So, since there are 3 rebate forms and only 2 sets of proof of purchase items (one set of UPCs and one set on the inside of the boxes), you will not qualify.I verified this with Symantec who claims this is a mistake.Does anyone know different?"
5,The zaniest show on MTV returns for season 2,"Picking up from the season 1 cliff hanger, the hard times of RJ Berger season 2 returns for more hilarious insanity. Described as Wonder years meets American Pie; The Hard Times Of RJ Berger is an hilarious and original comedy. From the first episode to the season finale; season 2 is filled with surprises throughout. From ""accidentally"" eating L.S.D. filled cookies to a sweet 16 party from hell the laughs never stop. The good natured RJ who is too nice to say no gets caught up in the schemes of everyone whether it's from his cousin, ""Vinnie"" from the jersey shore or the horrible advice of his best friend miles or his street wise guidance counselor ""Coach Sinclair"" it's bound to be season you won't soon forget. If You enjoyed season 1 your going to want to pick up season 2 as well."
1,"An Unedited, Poorly Scanned Copy","It is incredible that this book has not only made it to print but is actually advertised and sold by Amazon. It appears to have been copied by scanning and then printed, almost unedited, from the product of that copy method. Anyone in the least familiar with the scanning process knows that strange characters appear and words are often distorted and separated in an unusual manner. Nothing was done to ""clean up"" the text with the original in view. It is an ""Elibron Classic"" and published in 2006. Were it not that I need the text for a course I am enrolled it, I would have returned it summarily for a refund. Whole sentences are incomplete, strange and unusual words and markings appear [and they are not merely archaic words from a forgotten vocabulary]. It is a frustrating read, but with a little imagination the original elegance of Washington Irving's prose can be gleamed."
4,Good NIghtstand,"This was a good purchase. This nightstand goes well in our guestroom. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I found it a little bit time consuming to assemble. However, overall I am satisfied with this purchase."
4,Nice shower head,Nice replacement for a previous Moen posh-temp shower set up. Updated bath from brass to chrome and it looks and works great.
3,Great Show - Ameteurish Recording,"I wish I could report that this is a must-have disc for all Ellington fans, but the fact is you may want to take pause and consider carefully if you place a high value on sound quality.It's obvious that only 2 mics were used to record this performance, with some members of the band up close, and some at a distance, including Duke's piano. This results in a very unbalanced recording that strongly favors percussion. Oddly enough, it's a very good recording in the sense that it gives you an excellent impression of space, but unfortunately this seems to exaggerate the distance of some of the players. Duke sounds far away.This is a wonderful performance, and I would recommend this to any Ellington completest or anybody not normally critical of sound quality, but uncompromising audiophiles may be disappointed."
5,"A Wonderful, spontaneous, live recording","Intimate, you are there in sound, and the sound quality and musicianship are unsurpassed. One of my favorite CDs (really two CDs). If you love Ellington, or Jazz, or fine music in general this is a must have imho."
2,Just a generic dog book,Although it has some useful information for new dog owners this is just a generic dog book. It has very little specific to Chow Chows. It is mostly information that could apply to any breed. If you want to learn about Chow Chows pick another book.
1,This book was a bit of a disappointment ...,"Some of the pictures were nice ... but the information seemed quite generic and not specific to the chow chow at all. if one wants to learn more about chow chows, read another book!"
2,I loved the pictures,"Pictures were great and there is some useful info,but over allI was a bit disappointed."
3,Hoping for more remixes in the single!,Huge fan of Craig David. Should have had more remixes. Has only 1 remix and the radio edit. Not enough :(
2,For the very beginner,"Not necessarily a bad book, but a faux painting instruction book definitely for a beginner. Simplistic finishes that are far from a professional look."
3,This is an OK chair for the price range,"This chair is pretty comfortable, but for the price segment it is in, it's not that great.Steelcase's Leap chair is much more comfortable and reclines much better, and is around the same price range."
1,I HATE this chair!!!,"This is Stupid Chair!! Think twice and really try one out before you buy one. My employer bought these chairs for almost all of us in a recent remodel. The seat pan is non-breathable (although we were told it is breathable material) and sticks to your legs. AND, there is not enough padding in the seat. Most of us have added our own fabric pad, to make the chair usable. I have tried and tried to reset the chair, but my legs still get numb after 45 minutes of sitting. Might be fine for people under 30, but the rest of us are suffering."
5,Thank god,I can finally sleep at night. This unit works miracles... Easy to clean also. My allergies are bad so I keep it next to the bed at night on low.. I can finally breath again
5,4 years and counting,"I bought one of these unit four years ago because I was taking care of a turtle at the time and it was gross. Anyway, if made a huge difference in air quality in that room. It ran almost 24/7 for a year. After I passed the turtle along to a new home, I was used to the white noise it provided and still run it almost every night. I have noticed that if I don't use it my sinuses start acting up so it must be doing good things."
4,Uncertain whether the product really works,"First, upon receiving the product my first thought was how large it seemed. The picture seems to be a little misleading, because the design of the purifier makes it appear to look smaller. It was about 50% larger than I expected. So when purchasing pay attention to the measurements and determine whether the sizing is appropriate for space.Like many people I purchased this product to help with my allergies, but being that I do not live in a air-conditioned environment, I need to keep my windows open in order to stay cool (especially when I sleep at night). This may be affecting the performance of the product. Therefore, I'm still getting my allergies, and I have yet to pinpoint whether the product is at the least reducing my allergies."
1,Doesn't work for dust,I have had this unit for a year now and I can say that it does nothing for dust removal. I have gone through 3 cycles for cleaning the filter and there is nothing in the water when i rinse it out. There is a lot of dust on the unit fan blades which are AFTER the filter which tell me that the dust is going straight through the filter. It is in my bedroom and there is always dust on my furniture. The uv lights on the top of the unit can be annoying if you don't like your room lit up like Vegas when you sleep.
1,ack. what IS this?!,"no no no. for one thing this book doesnt even deserve ONE star. for another, although i have nothing against Christians, i'm a Demonic Hunter(and witch), i track and consort demons often in other words. the author of this book doesnt seem to know a lot about Demons. i found it a rather pathetic attempt to make you feel safer and happier with God. ...and i never will be but this book was just ridiculous."
4,A must-read for those interested in Olympic history,"Through extensive research and with the help of many examples, Shaikin presents his argument that the Olympics can never be free of politics. While many decried the boycotts that took place in 1980 and 1984, Shaikin points out that these acts were perhaps inevitable and certainly better than some of the alternatives. Shaikin points out the interference of politics in the Games going back to the first Olympiad in ancient Greece and works his way forward. While this topic could be quite dry, Shaikin uses plenty of quotes and examples to add color and life to his argument. What is most interesting are the in-depth looks at what was going on behind the scenes of Los Angeles' bid for the Games and the USSR boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics. This is a must-read for anyone truly interested in the Olympic Games and the part they play in world politics, economics and, of course, athletics."
5,Required Reading,"For those of you who think sports are just fun and games--and for those of you who know better--Bill Shaikin's ""Sport and Politics"" makes for a fascinating read. Shaikin uses example of the 1984 Olympic Games as a prism to explore the intricate connections between sports, politics and society. And what's more, he dedicated his work to his mom and dad. What a nice Jewish boy!"
1,Wrong Dedication,"Being that my brother wrote the book, one might think I would be biased. However, being that he dedicated the book to my parents and not to me, I have never, and will never, read the book."
4,"Yo, This Mix Tape is Whiggedy Wack!","Hey dawg, growin' up on the mean streets of Farmtown, Indiana (pop. 312 G's), I didn't have no way to express the anger I felt from coming from such a ideal WASP home, with a mother who loved me and a OB-GYN dad who only saw 6 figs a year.So me and my homies down at the 4-H found this CD at Wal-Mart--I mean, our crack house where we do our bidness. And finally, MTV spoke of real, non-pre-fab music that talked about life in the 'hood.For all you playas raising the roof (at the local livestock arena) who grew up in a true ""gangsta"" (and fisherman's) paradise, let me just say for REAL music that tells our story, yo, there's nothing as raw, uninhibited, and as unplanned as an MTV production. They got mad street cred, aight?I only give it 4 stars cuz wasn't enough brown honies for me, King Albino, Tru Dawg till the end.By the way, that Ashton Kutchner's Punked show is jus like me and my dawgs kick it here in F-town."
3,Okay Intro For the Price,"This is an okay but far from great intro to The Lord's music. If it weren't for the low price, this CD would rate much lower. We really could have used some freaking liner notes, for instance. When the hell were these songs recorded?! Some don't sound so old and were likely rerecordings. The sad thing is that Sutch's best recordings are all but impossible to find nowadays, so we have to be satisfied with this lackluster package for now."
1,This is the Short Story and Not the Novel,"This Kindle Edition of ""Tongues of the Moon"" is the short story that first appeared in Amazing Stories, September 1961; and is not the longer novel version, first published in 1964, that I was expecting. The short story is only the first 20% of the novel. I was shocked that this was not pointed out on the purchase page."
5,A most enjoyable recording,"The most enjoyable live recording I've had the pleasure of listening to. ""Pensativa"" is a master piece. Where can I get a copy of this recording?"
5,Important historical document,"This is not really a book, but rather a booklet. The further title of the booklet is...During a Captivity of Twenty-one Months Among The Comanche Indians; With a Sketch of Their Manners, Customs, Law & c., & with A Short Description of the Country Over Which She Traveled Whilst With the Indians Written By Herself. Mrs. Plummer was kidnapped by the Comanches along with Cynthia Ann Parker (of fame and mother of Quanah Parker). Her tale is quite interesting, but somewhat revolting in that it describes in detail how the indians murdered Mrs. Plummer's son. It was written in 1839. 28 pp."
2,small,"Too small..I should buy 8.5 size. I normally buy 7.5 and 8, but this really small on my feet. Kinda waste my money on this. I did not return, probably will cause me more. :-("
5,I keep buying these,"Five.Five pairs.I bought my first pair of Reebok Classic Nylon shoes in 2005, and they have yet to let me down. I just bought my fifth pair last week. I've worn every pair until the soles are flat and smooth, and then I keep them around for yard work or quick trips outside. On top of that, you can wear them with just about anything. I wear them with shorts and a t-shirt or even with jeans and a button-up for a casual evening out with friends.I think five pairs speak for themselves, but if not I'll let you know when I buy my sixth pair in a year or so."
2,incorrect size,"the shoe was not correct size. Apparently, a larger width is not available. Size 11.5W is needed. Shoes were returned"
5,These are great snealers,"I've purchased several pairs of these sneakers. They are comfortable, and they last at least one year, even if you wear them every day!"
1,Once great but now 3rd rate junk,"I have worn these Reebok Nylon Classics for years. They just fit and were a reasonable price. However, when they outsourced these to China in the 90s the quality started to go down. When they went to Vietnam they got worse but I still bought them. The last pair I bought was made in Cambodia. A poor fit to begin with and almost no arch support anymore. Then after only two weeks, the tread on both shoes began to come off. What were once really good, affordable sneakers have now been reduced to third rate junk - all to meet the bottom line of Reebok. Geez, bring them back to be made in America..."
2,reebok classic,"I have been buying this model for at least 35 years and was always satisfied, now they changed the internal parts of the shoe taking out the arch and using a thinner pad with a different feel. They will not get my businessanymore, trying to reduce cost on material and design is a big mistake. Good bye Reebok, my last shoe."
3,Wee-Bok,The shoe is fine but too small. I would suggest getting a bigger size than usual or try on a similar make shoe in a store to get correct sizing.
1,sexy?,"I don't know how these look on a woman as most of my wife is dead. But if you put them on a pillow, or a giant stuffed animal you won at the fair, you'd be surprised what a few drinks and an active imagination can make it feel like. Hey I ain't coming over to your place and judging me. I'm just offering some advice, an amazon review if you will."
1,Garbage.,Didn't come with Vent clip that is advertised and the lock tab for the window mount snapped off as I pushed down on it.
3,"not bad, but you get what you pay for","This product is exactly what it seems: a cheap phone/gps mount that will suction to your windshield. The thing feels pretty cheaply made right out of the box, but it does work for at least a little while. I've gone through 2 of these since the iPhone 4 came out just a few months ago. The little ratcheting mechanism that tightens the foam-lined arms around your device broke on my first one. You could hear the plastic ratchet inside snap one day. On the second one, the suction cup mount stopped staying on the windshield as soon as the weather turned cold. This is not a terrible product based on the price, but I wouldn't expect to get any more than 6 months out of the thing if you leave it in your vehicle in the sun or cold. I'm shopping for a higher quality mount right now."
4,Does well for its price,"I got this to hold my cell phone (Palm Pre) while displaying map info. It fastens securely to the windshield using the suction cup and adjusts well to face where it's needed. One caveat is the vent attachment doesn't work with my Mazda 6 vents, the slats are too deep/long for the clips to hook into. It seems to hold up pretty decently, even though it feels like very lightweight plastic."
4,Great for different uses,"I needed a car mount that I could use for my iPhone and GPS - this works extremely well for practically any handheld electronic gadget. What I really like is that I can have my iPhone on landscape view for videos and quickly twist it upright to navigate through songs, podcasts, etc. The quality of the the material is less than stellar, but for the price, it's a good buy."
2,Not worth the money,"I thought this was what I wanted until I tried mounting it, the suction cup is junk. Stuck to the windshield for all of 5 seconds 3 times. Prime example of that great Chinese quality we have all come to love."
2,Broke...,It was nice...but the suction cup ended up peeling apart and it became useless. Probably worked right for about 6 months.
5,Great for GPS navigation,"I own this car mount holder and it is great. It can act as either windshield mount or vent mount, and it holds PDA/MP3/Phone/iPOD very tight without slipping.It works great for GPS navigation with my hw6515 PDA Phone."
1,Don't waste your money,"I just received this today and within 2 minutes it was obvious I had made a mistake in purchasing this product. There are no instructions except for one poorly-written, nonsensical sentence on the back of the box. The tip of the gooseneck broke off when I tried to slide it into the back of the holder. And the holder itself broke while I was trying to adjust it to fit my iPhone. I'm now boxing up the pieces of this disaster and sending it back to the seller. If it were possible to rate this zero stars, I would!"
3,"It Works, but it isn't great","I have been using this lightly (about once or twice a week on long drives) for a few months now. The construction of the product feels cheap, but does work. The suction cup works, but is not completely secure. After temperature changes it seems to lose its suction and must be re-attached to the window. It has fallen off a couple times, but it is uncommon. In conclusion - If you have a touchscreen phone and you plan on poking it while driving, get something more secure. If you don't mind something a bit more delicate and want to save some cash, this thing should suffice."
3,Vent mount mighty crappy,"I bought this item specifically for using it on one of my air vents. However, the way it mounts to the vent is very loose and the quality is quite low. I was too lazy to return it so I am using it now, but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone - there has to be a better product out there."
1,Broke on day 1,Tried to move the slider to fit in the phone and it broke on first try. Flimsy plastic. Trashed.
2,FIFA Voices,"Thought I had made a good purchase but after only one month, the cd skips. I've tried playing it on several cd players to make sure it was the cd and not the player. I feel I wasted my money here."
3,"Good surrealistic film, with some reservations","This 1970 film from Czechoslovakia is a surrealistic movie that deals with a teenage girl bizarre dreams after reaching puberty. The film is certainly imaginative, has very strong visuals, is submerged in lovely central European folklore and is shot in luscious color. But what bothered me a little was something else: the constant mockery of the Catholic Church. Here one must say that the Catholic Church was not the most oppressive institution in Czechoslovakia in 1970. Rather, this was the time of the communist repression after the breakup of the Prague Spring. So, in light of this, these shots against a potential enemy of the communist regime seem a bit politically opportunistic, and gives a somewhat bad taste to an otherwise fine film."
3,What was that about then?,"3*s because I managed to sit through the whole movie in 1 sitting.From the point of view of someone who has no idea what makes a movie 'good' or 'bad':It felt like watching a 20s movie with 70s technology, colour and sound, although since all the dialogue is subtitled, it felt like watching a silent movie with a music score. Also the imagery is very 70s soft-core porn, vampire movie like.The conversations make no real sense - at first I thought that this might be partially due to the inaccurate translation, but I guess they don't make sense in their original language either.Loads of visually interesting images filmed on a low-budget. Each scene appears to be an individual mini-story, with little connection between them.I do see the other reviewers connection to Company of Wolves. A movie that I did like."
2,Conjunto Chaney -- Conjunto del Amor,"This is not the same as the original ""El Conjunto del Amor"" 1991 album. So here are the songs:1. He Sabido que te Amaba2. Concavo y Convexo3. Cada cosa en su lugar4. Vamos a darnos tiempo5. Acariciame6. Chiquitita7. Estas SeguraOverall, sound quality is between fair and good. It doesn't sound like a in-house recopy ... but it does (if that makes sense).Hope this helps you save money!"
1,Brit is asinine!,"Your initial post: Jan 9, 2012 7:49:31 PM PSTJessica Veuleman says:Just read the book and found her to be an over-the-top drama queen. She is only famous because of Peter Sellers and she appears to be a husband stealing whore. Her quote ""As a woman I did not find Sophia Loren to be attractive at all"", she's insane Loren is so much more attractive than this fake blond could ever be. Brit said that Sophia's full body never appealed to her, what, isn't she the one who later got a boob job? Hmm, I think she is jealous of Lorens good looks and talents that she has never possessed! I find her to way to self-assured considering we would not even know this B movie actresses name if she had never married Peter sellers. And of all the bond girls she is the least attractive and least talented. If you want to see how a woman can latch on and use and steal other woman's boyfriend and husband than this book is for you."
3,Great Gift!,My daughter wanted a copy of just one the movies included in this bundle so she really got a nice surprise when she opened her gift.
3,Nicholas Sparks Romance,"Nicholas Sparks is a great author, and I have read several of his books, but I am so tired of all the sad endings, I don't think I will spend anymore of my time reading his books or watching his movies, I would like to feel good with a happy ending just once in a while, his work is just to much of a downer for me."
4,service,very fast service! It was bran new! I really enjoyed coming home and having four good movies waiting for me.
5,AWESOME,This set is great! I love Nicholas Sparks' books and movies. The idea of a set like this is amazing. You get 4 AWESOME movies in a nice box set for cheaper than you could separately. I like the fact each movie has its own individual case.
5,4film sparks Romance,well my favorite movie is a walk to remember its about a a girl following her faith she winds up finding real love to find out when you think all said done you find out she got a life treating disease could change everything
5,Big fan!,I have read all of Nicholas Sparks' books and love them all! Most of them have transferred to movie form very well. He writes stories that you can relate to.
5,Awesome,Sparks is a favorite in our family and this collection is great. We read the books them buy the films. These arrived timely and in great shape! Thanks!
4,What a great deal!,"I was interested in two of the four before I found this set, but was happy to have come across it because it was such a great price to include four great movies. One thing worth mentioning (the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that all four discs come stacked together in one case: they don't each have their own 'page' whether hard plastic snap-in or cloth-type insert which would, of course, better protect each disc, so it might not be a good idea for those who are rough on their things or have kids who aren't careful. But this does save space from having four separate DVDs on my shelf and is such a bargain that it hardly matters!"
5,Wonderfull - I thought these were Chick Flicks,"I enjoyed these very much. The Plots / story lines are excellant. My wife wanted these so I thought what the hick. Then she wanted me to watch them with her. I thought, OMG Chick Flicks - But I enjoyed them"
4,Nicholas Sparks Romances 4 Film Favorites,"I already owned two of the movies, but still had not seen the other two. I recently saw""Night at the Roadanthe (sp?) and loved it. I enjoyed the Notebook and Message in a Bottle also. Thank you for combining them."
3,Who chose the songs for this one?,"""Ambiend Anarchists"" has a number of superior tracks on it, notably the live version of ""Assasins"" with the ambient opener. However, many of the versions of older songs are not the best ones. Psychedellic warlords and Urban Guerrilla are particularly bad (although Sonic Attack is mind-blowing). There are some real gems here, but keep your finger on the ""skip"" button."
3,"good compilation for newcomers, but fans may have the tracks","ambient anarchists is not a bad double compilation, probably the best hawkwind compilation going (there are soo many). unfortunately it doesn't really offer up enough new stuff for the hardcore fan whose got 20+ hawks lps as it is. (a killer live ""urban guerrila"" might just make it though.) However, if you don't have diddly by way of a hawks collection but like what you've heard, this is a great way to get an overview and an idea where to go next."
3,VERY AVERAGE,I bought this album when it first came out.And the songs got very old very fast.I wouldn't recomend this one unless you really like coolio.
1,No magic at all,"Just that, apart from C U when U get there, the rest is just the worst coolio possible"
3,Not bad...but not his best,"Coolio tries hard and it is tough to identify what he is as a rapper, he delivers hard at times, and then messages of warning and then some pop...ok album"
3,Works as advertised,These showed up on time and works as advertised. They didn't quite fit my chairs but that was due to my fault not a shortcoming of the product.
1,Too much trouble,You have to be a maintenance man/woman to keep this thing going. Not worth the effort to put together and once put together keeps falling apart. Would not recomend this toy unless you want to get even with someone
1,Stay away from this thing,I knew it was trouble right out of the box. It took forever to put together and the combination of intricate little parts and flimsy attachment points meant this toy was going to be total frustration. I was right.My 5-year-old gets frustrated to tears trying to play with it. The elevator falls apart and when it does work it grabs the foam off the 'washers' on the way up. The 'sprayers' constantly fall off of it. The previous design is far better but no longer available.When my son isn't looking it's going out to the trash.
2,A disappointing purchase,"My son was so excited about this. we bought it as a special reward for him and it keeps breaking apart. He can't put it together by himself so I constantly have to put the tracks back together. As far as the actual ""wash,"" it's been ok, although a bit of a pain to clean the soap out, but I was prepared for that. My son still wants to play with it, so I guess I'm just stuck sticking tracks back together. It would be so much more fun if it didn't fall apart so easily. It makes me wonder why Hot Wheels wants it's name on such flimsy, junky toys."
1,Don't waste your money,It took forever to assemble and the elevator never worked right. It fell apart the first time my son played with it. I was really disappointed!
1,Total Waste,"This CD is a complete fabrication, not one of the original performers are featured. It's a total fake. Don't waste your money. This type of thing should be illegal, and I fault Amazon for not warning the buyer."
5,"It was exactly what I needed, and the price was unbeatable.","This was a bit out of my price range, but I really thought it would satisfy my scooting needs. My Sea Doo Explorer Dildo needed a new battery, so I knew what had to be done. I had to sell my butler, my Veyron, my daughter and four of my six mansions, but I needed it that badly. Truly a small price to pay."
1,Horrible,"I can appreciate Slipknot for being very good at what they do, but I do not listen to them. I thought Stone Sour would be more my style. The more melodic heavy sound is what I prefer. However, Stone Sour is horrible at it. Breaking Benjamin is 1000 times better than this rehashed junk. There is no real feel for being genuine or poignant. Nothing that Stone Sour has created makes me feel connected to their music. I have listened to both Stone Sour and Come What(ever) May. Both albums were the same for me. I feel the same disconnection when I listen to Godsmack. The lyrics are so generic. The vocals and the music do not enhance each other, they just blend together in a noisy bland way. There is no distinct character to the lyrics, vocals or the music."
4,A nice addition to a music collection,"Stone Sour hits the stores again with their second self-titled CD. Corey Taylor and Jim Root from Slipknot, along with a few other talented guys make this band. While, there are some pretty obvious relations between Stone Sour and Slipknot, this band has a name of their own. Sure, some of the songs sound a lot like typical Slipknot. But there are differences as well. Corey sings and shows that he actually has a great voice. The radio-played song ""Bother"" is just one of the songs that shows how marvelous his voice actually is. The harmonies, mixed with the guitars and other instruments make this CD and great musical experience. There is little I see wrong with this CD. It is easy to see the relationship between Stone Sour and Slipknot, but that isn't any reason to pass this CD up. Hopefully we will see future albums from this band. They are definately gifted."
5,Totally delivers,"This whole album is good, which is pretty rare these days. ""Cold Reader"" is the best track on the disc with pissed-off Cory belting the chorus over Root's grungy riff. ""Monolith"" is also top notch, weaving, melodic and catchy. ""Get Inside"" caught my attention several years ago when this album came out. It's also great, hard and fast, although I prefer Cory signing to his ""rapping."" The album is very diverse and original with great song writing. This is quality hard rock/metal.If you like Slipknot, you'll like Stone Sour. Even if you don't care for Slipknot, you should give it a shot. If you find Slipknot a bit too bludgeoning, you might like SS. I bought this album along with Stone Sour's second effort, ""Come What(ever) May."" That's a great album too (a few too many ballads for my tastes), but this first one is clearly better."
4,Solid CD,I was recently introduced to Stone Sour because they are touring with Papa Roach and I have tickets to their concert. I am pleased to have finally found them after all of these years.
4,Stone Sour - Stone Sour,"This is a very interesting album for me because I feel many genres are represented here. From metal to soft rock, this album encompasses a full spectrum of emotion... and volume. Honestly, I can really appreciate that. Take a track like ""Get Inside"", which is a total mosh pit anthem, and then move into ""Bother"", which would find a cozy home on college radio. Their talent really does impress me, not many bands could pull such a thing off. So all in all I really enjoyed this CD. Anyone expecting a Slipknot metalfest will indeed be let down, but someone with more expansive tastes could get a lot of enjoyment from this album."
5,great,"stone sour is a great cd full of melodic heavy tunes such as inhale and get inside to the great bother ballard, corey has a great vox and iy ashamed that he waste his talents in the group slipknot"
4,It's good... But it's no Slipkot,"This CD is a good Slipknot alternative. Taking into to mind they're 2 different genre's of music I say this:The lyrics are good, but not as strong and passionate as those used in Slipknot songs.The music is good to listen to when your ""metal-exhausted""Finally, it's a better decision than Murderdolls... Yuck!"
2,"not my thing, got bored","First off i would like to say that although i like a limited amount of nu-metal (system of a down, Mudvayne, i guess you could throw tool in there even though they are more there own thing) I am much more into the harder stuff like nile and black metal like Soilwork and Opeth. With that said this niche of music is not my fortay. ""Get inside"" and ""Bother"" are decent songs but the rest of it just got boring for me. I try to give it a full listen and i just can't. I end up taking it out and putting something with better instrumentation in. Was not a huge fan of slipknot either."
2,not that good,"Their sophmore effort is 10 better than this one, don't bother buying this one, theres only 2 good songs on this album, their 2nd cd is great from start to finish...I bought this one after i had their 2nd album thinking it would be just as good, but i was dissapointed, just go out and buy---Stone Sour, Come What(ever) May....."
1,This CD is no good,"This Cd only has a couple of good songs the rest are horrible, do not waste money on Stone Sour and just stick to Slipknot."
1,why do I hate Corey Taylor?,"This is ten times worse than Slipknot. It is laced with his stupid rap and annoying voice. It really isn't any different from them either. This could pass for the new Slipknot album. I don't get why so many people admire this guy. He sucks at everything. Singing, screaming, rapping (even though you're not suppposed to be rapping anyway). He is like the male Courtney Love. A disgrace to everything. Well, here is more nu-metal for the easily impressed mind. If you're a fan of horrible nu-metal with no talent like Linkin Park, Papa Roach, Slipknot, or Trust Company, then this should be right up your alley."
4,Impressed,"They're not as heavy as slipknot. If you like slipknot, that doesn't mean you'll like StoneSour. Many people try to compare them which isn't right. StoneSour has a more persistent sound through this album and Taylor sings with a more humanistic rock voice, which isn't bad at all. The instruments tend be pretty bold on this album, I can't say the whole album is enjoyable though, a few tracks on here let down from the others. It's a good listen though for your common metal fan."
3,Would You Believe...,"Who, outside of Iowa, knew that vocalist Corey Taylor and guitarist Jim Root had a far more melodic side than Slipknot? Probably not many, but this album tries to change that. And for the most part, it accomplishes said goal. ""Get Inside"" is a mosh pit call, but basically a waste of space on a record that is far more interesting than one would originally think. Put it this way; there is no way you would think any of these guys could be in Slipknot. That doesn't mean the album lacks heavyness. ""Cold Reader"" and ""Inhale"" sound like ultra-heavy Soundgarden. AIC is effectively evoked on the hypnotic opening of ""Monolith."" A few nuimbers, most notably ""Tumult"" revisit the best of thrash metal. The quiet ballad ""Bother"" from Spider Man is included, showing sometimes there is indeed more than meets the eye. Pretty cool stuff."
4,good cd,"I was really suprised when i first heard this cd. I listen to slipknot, and i expected slipknot type of music. it isn't, corey taylor SINGS in this cd, with some screaming and growling thrown in. favs: inhale, orchids, tumult, and monolith."
2,Heh heh...,"Umm, sure, ""Bother"" is REALLY emotional. Well, sure. You can call it that. But this deserves 2 stars for ""Inhale"" and ""Get Inside,"" yet it also deserves 1 star because it is getting compared to a perfect band like SlipKnoT.Buy this if you want a good little time-killer, but if you want a great thrash or speed metal album, go buy Iowa and SlipKnoT, where you could get a better taste of Corey Taylor and Jim Root."
5,What a debut!,"Kathleen Wilhoite is one of those rare people who not only act incredibly well (she was Chloe, Susan's sister, in 'ER') but also sing and not make a complete botch-up of it. I originally heard of Kathleen Wilhoite when 'Wish We'd Never Met' was used in an episode of 'Buffy' called 'Consequences'. If you liked that song then you will no doubt love this album.The tracks here are a real good mix, with Kathleen neither leaning towards one style of the other. Each song is completely individual and rather than spouting out the same old love songs, any tracks on here are easily related to. Of the faster tracks, probably 'Suck The Joy' is the best, with 'Old Familiar' being a personal favourite of the slower songs.This is not only an artist that defies conventions but also one that makes completely new ones for herself. 'Pitch Like A Girl' is a valuable addition to anyone's record collection, worth any amount of hunting for. It's simply magnificent."
5,An excellent lirical and musical experience,"I heard some of the songs off this CD at a Sundance Film Festival 1999 viewing of ""Valerie Flake"", and I just had to run out and buy this CD. It's an amazing work - especially how the songs connected to the movie characters."
5,Excellent music - touches the soul of anyone who has loved.,"Introduced to the CD via Valerie Flake at the 1999 Chicago International Film Festival. The film's power is supported by the great music on this disc. I recommend the CD to anyone - but maybe especially to anyone having been through difficult times recently. Divorce, other loss of a spouse or lover - anyone confused by the complexities of love and attraction and identity. Yes, I know the movie has affected the way I hear the music, but the music influenced the way I saw the movie. And the impact of both will be refreshed every time I play this CD. Buy it today!"
